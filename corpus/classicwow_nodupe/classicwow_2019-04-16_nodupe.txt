I’d love to see a disciplined entire raid team just all toss their buffs on them and be on their way.
---
---
---
There are likely more people unwilling to play on a private than people unwilling to pay the sub for the game they love. Private servers are a deterrent, not an incentive. Sure it's free, but it's an MMO. It is hard to commit time and energy to a service you don't think will be around. It's the same issue new MMOs have, getting people invested and willing to trust the devs. I know personally I've never been able to hit max on private server because the time investment doesn't feel worth it, I don't know if my character could be gone when I come back so I stop around lvl30 and take a break.
---
Ah... I thought elementalist spec was favored for mages in pvp fire/arcane
---
Polymorph: Piggy.  The little squeal of terror it makes when you cast it is so satisfying.

Obviously right....? As if they have a solid date and wouldn't just released it ?

---
Not hunter, I would say druid
---
you know that the 1000 agi statement is pure mockery and has been around for 14 years...
---

---
That meme was around before meme s were a thing and even if you were to reach 1000 agi it would still only work as alliance hunter (lightning reflexes + kings = +26,5 % more agi. You would get  the +500 attack power from swapping to SV to compensate for losing the +500 attack power on 4 other players and your pet.
---
Is this supposed to be a funny meme? Looks like a boomer attempt at making a meme with impact font.
---
Stop. My sides cant take this.

Who ever said Classic was for a "new generation of gamers?" Obviously there won't be mass appeal by modern standards, that's basically the point, it's an ancient MMO for better or worse
---
And you're kidding yourself if you think pissing about with a few specs that underperform in raids (but are fine in PvP/leveling, for the record) would add anything for players that will take issue with archaic design, Classic will have way bigger modern standard "problems" for them than their talent choices
---
I feel like a lot of stuff in this thread is how it works on private servers, but never did in vanilla.  I've never seen/heard of this item insta-proccing hearthstone; though it is obscure enough that I could believe it.  The insta-capping AB flags though I definitely do not believe.
---
They are written for 1.12 so they probably won't be usable in classic. Anyway my top 3 are:
---
1. questie,
---
2.some UI add-on (usually pfui) 
---
3. an auto shot timer because I play hunter
---
Thats why you spend it on Slice &amp; Dice.
---
Nope. Because the proc rate is ridiculously low. Just trying to get them to proc would cost you a colossal amount of dps loss.
---
Jom Gabbar gives like 650 AP at its peak. If you can time your burst then it’s pretty OP.
---
"on private servers aimed shot is doing 8 more dmg at max rank than in vanilla this alone changes blah blah toilet noises blah blah"
---
I don’t remember any names, but it would be a ui, casting bar that shows latency so I know when to start my next spell and dot timers. I will be playing a warlock.
---
I haven’t decided on professions yet. I am leaning towards alchemy and herbalism so I would want a map addon to show what and were I collected herbs to make it easier to farm, that would be about it.
---
I would say priest. Everybody loves priest in vanilla.
---
So your answer is conjecture on a presumption of what would've happened if something else didn't. The server was taken down, neither us have any idea what would have happened. But what we do know is more servers rose too take its place, a petition received thousands of signatures and Blizzard is bringing it back.  
---
Your using your personal feeling about Vanilla to form your argument when the facts say otherwise. Factually there is demand. How many MMOs do you know of that have reverse engineered classic servers done by volunteers with a player base in the 10s of thousands. Not many. Vanilla WoW is weirdly popular and supported by the fanbase. 
---
You may feel a way but thousands clearly feel otherwise and projecting your feelings onto others without evidence of their validity is dumb and a waste of time on your part. Classic WoW will be successful whether you like it or not. It has a strong dedicated community unlike many other games. Multiplayer Games that are 15 years old and still going strong community wise are special and usually if given the proper treatment explode because there is a reason for that dedication.
---
That's what she said!
---
The FoV not being fixed.
---
Well for Rank 14 you *need* to be in Bracket 1 for RP otherwise you'll never get to R14, so you need to be in Bracket 1 to keep it as well due  to decay. There are a finite number of BR1 slots on each server, so technically he was crowding the ladder as one less person each week could get R14 if he was taking up one of the BR1 slots.
---
Had me til he said Druids spend most of their time raiding in moonkin form lol.

All these people debating on when summer ends. 
---
While I sit here in California dreading next month, because that's when it will start to hit 90... then in June it will be 100+ until after Halloween. 
---
It is either summer, or less hot summer, here. Lol.
---
Those systems won't work so well in Vanilla. Pugs don't exist like they do now and gear upgrades aren't linear. When bosses drop 3 pieces of gear and you have 40 raiders why would you give a pug a try? If youre commited you want a guild so you'll actually have a chance at gear. A 40man PuG is not a place to earn loot.
---
Yeah, and then somebody else tags in and slows you, just as you think you can get away... feel happy knowing you make people feel awful in that situation.
---
voidwalker FTW!
---
Any cloth wearer should jump at the chance. That robe
---
Half these specs are fire in pvp. Just shows how much this game revolves around pve
---
I believe the idea is to get slice and dice going before engaging a real target.
---
Oh please. You can’t cite rogues in M+ as “blizzard losing their way” while ignoring the ENORMOUS gulf between classes in endgame vanilla raiding.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion but I actually think transmog was the only improvement made to the game from classic wow.
---
I would have loved classic wow with no changes except transmog but I guess I understand why that couldnt be done. Cause once you make one change the flood gates open...
---
I’d say Druid. Far more versatile.  You can basically change the entire way the class plays with a simple respec.  Only class that can tank, heal, ranged DPS, and melee DPS as a single character.  You mentioned wanting to explore and work on profs, and a Druid would be better suited there with bonus movement speed on cat form + stealth.
---
Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing, he knows *exactly* what he's doing
---
I watched rokkanis' hillsbrad video, with rogue dwarf stalking hordes to the tune of Jimmy eat world nothing wrong. Rogue dwarf was my first character to play, but my first max level was an orc shaman because I loved the flavor and versatility of the class.
---
I'm not sure I would be AMA worth, but I would be more than happy to answer any questions.  It's been a real long time since I worked there, but it really was one of the coolest experience looking back on it.  There was a lot of genuine excitement from basically everyone in the building and that energy was infectious.
---
One of the most fun days ever was the day the ZG plague hit.  My roommate was still working over night and I was on morning shift.  When I walked in at 6am he rushed up and hes like "IT'S MADNESS THE WHOLE WORLD HAS THE PLAGUE ON EVERY SERVER" I had no idea what was going on, only to walk into mass hysteria on the floor.  In a sense I think we were all enjoying it as much as the players were, and we got so many tickets from people who thought it was a planned thing.
---
When I first started working there the queues were like 4 days long.  It was actually pretty common for players to answer my messages with "I forgot about that, wasn't that like a week ago".  Some months later when we finally 0'd out the ticket queue the entire GM Floor cheered.  It really did create a lot of genuine excitement that we some how got to that bottom of that, cause honestly most of us were going home from the GM floor to login anyways, we felt it as players too.
---
And a lot of the groundwork for what we have today started with TBC, which is arguably the best iteration of the game (not for me, the leveling started to suck in TBC). Vanilla had a lot of problems, but that is expected from a groundbreaking game of such magnitude
---
My aunt, who married the security guy recently said the janitor is not only good in bed, but also the only one actually doing any real work on Classic.  The two devs (also reportedly good in bed) just sit and watch Orc porn all day. Security guys doesn’t do shit.
---
I always look at them as the freest of kills as a rogue
---
To me, a Classic Summer alludes to the idea of playing classic all throughout summer. A mid august or later release is not a classic summer.
---
Thotbot and minimizing
---
This is blizzard brohime just wait
---
Oh yeah, when the new guild calendar came out in TBC I told everyone in /guild that alt-F4 was the shortcut to bring it off.
---
Then everyone laughed at the 2 logoff notifications we got right after that.
---
Mods, why was my post hidden from the top/past 24 hrs?  I am clearly within the 24 hour window and I am above other posts and still not showing
---
Oh please. Dont regail me about the woes of off specs in raiding in vanilla. People did nax with ret pallies, moonkin, shadow priests, and every other spec you think had problems. Vanilla raiding was easy if you had 20 people with brains and 20 people who could follow directions. 
---
All classes had their place, some specs were less effective and represented but people still brought them because they were guildies and friends. There is no single class in vanilla that warped the game nearly as much as rogues in the MDI. Yes warrior tanks were needed by design but 1-4 people out of 40 is a much smaller raid percentage than 2/5 in the MDI.
---
He is not planning on take vacations for wow from what I'm seeing and he assumed the other dude isn't either
---
I think best enchants in vanilla are stat ones. They worth money on endgame bc they so expensive and annoying to grind (lots of time in felwood and winterspring) 
---
For druids procs don't work , so you need to go agi, ofc that all applies of you find some guild to accept you something other than healer , which in vanilla it's kinda hard
---
What time zone are you guys playing in and what time will raids be
---
recently got that quest done on a private server by 2manning the dungeon up to the stables with a friendly druid. totally doable, only 1 or 2 tough pulls.
---
reminds me of Thunderfury. Our TBC main tank used it still at 70 because the proc was still good at 70
---
We did that on our server too. We hosted a raffle where a few people would get carried through an nd raid and grab any and all loot they wanted. Including boes
---
\*Rockhide Stronkfish
---
You can get exalted with every main faction by donating cloth. İt's easy if you are a mage but benefits just be able to get their mount and cheaper repairs , so not sure if it's worth it.
---
I wouldn't mind if they did it after phase 6. I kinda want to experience the shitty side of specs as they were, too.
---
Oh man Balance druid was truly truly awful and unplayable in Vanilla. I stuck resto through Vanilla but as soon as TBC dropped with massively upgraded balance talents I switched and it was actually playable!
---
Oh god...
---
It is if you get the Hand of Rag lol
---
Np games get delayed all the time
---
Source?
---
Blizzard has never delayed anything
---
Games dont get delayed at all
---
It's trash for melees but decent for hunters, later on you can combo it with t2 8/8, earthstrike, devilsaur eye and even jom gabbar, getting up to 1000+ bonus attack power.
---
KTM , Questy , interface add-on (Luna is nice and simple) and cast bar addons. Enemy health bar and cast bar addons are nice too
---
Seriously just YouTube 2018 blizzcon open ceremony.  Watch it
---
Power leveling through vanilla is nothing like retail, and your vacations plans arent worth more than other people's but sure, you do you
---
IIRC they nerfed the proc because it was too OP in PVP I just don't remember at what point they did it but I'm pretty it was fairly early in TBC because of Arena exploits.
---
They had a lot of needs to items by taking the item level into account for spell effect and resistance instead of the "caster level" because quite a few odd items were kinda broken like green whelp armor.
---
rage sticks between stance swapping at 0 to 25 (with 5 talent points in the arms talent) as well.
---
I saw ...  Hmmm. Madseason show I believe, exploited/walljumped, whatever I to the water next to nessy.   It was kind of cool.
---
Northern Sweden. First week of September it's generally no longer hot outside.
---
Yeah, the entire genre they rebuilt was so full of problems it was holding it back as a form of gaming.  WoW tearing down some of those barries for entry made so much sense.
---
I never felt it more than when I took a break from EQ.  I had been off for like 4 months and my guild made me reapply to rejoin, in order to catch up I had to raid with guild who were behind us and therefore resented the fuck out of us.  The nice people would tell me stfu and don't wipe us, while everyone else would heckle the fuck out of me.  I didn't even feel bad for me, I was thankful they let me along, I felt bad how bad my guild fucked them, they were entire expansions behind cause we monopolized shit, I can't blame them. 
---
This was the environment WoW was trying to fix, it was gonna take more than 1 iteration to smooth out all the rough edges that created experiences like that.
---
SM/Ruin is still not a rot spec. It’s still about burst with shadowbolts and shadowburn. 
---
The only true rot specs are deep Affliction with drain talents or Afflic/SL. Both are very suboptimal for pvp but fun if you like to be tanky.
---
Where is my dance studio then?
---
I gave you a source already earlier, which you replied to. I genuinely feel embarrassed for you dude, it’s clear that you’re genuinely dimwitted.
---
Great points with the warrior! It’d be great not being completely owned by rogues and there’ll be a lot of them. Yeah idk how tough gearing will be for those classes.
---
All I care about now is the release date honestly. If it’s anytime after early-mid July I’ll be really bummed.
---
Lick your wounds and go away lmao
---
Its part of the experience.
---
Planning on going a 30/0/21 warlock. Out of curiosity, what pet is used in which situation? Obviously questing/soloing is voidwalker, but in 5 mans/raids/pvp, which pet is the "go-to"?
---
it is, if you look in the chat, the reason why they're talking about Kruul is because the tbc beta is live
---

---
This is the general attitude they have toward things that are earned in one game, but not applied to another.
---
As they have said, Classic will be part of the WoW subscription.
---
So, you will be getting two separate versions of the game for the price of one.
---
Name checks out
---
A good amount of folks in this sub try to justify everything vanilla didn't achieve to put down retail, it is what it is
---
I never used them on progression, or just cleared Content that was still difficult, but when we were in naxx I would use them running mc and bwl purely for the fun.
---
Depends, what class are they going?
---
Hmm did the nerf affect PVE? I know he tanked till sometime around Sunwell with it, maybe he dropped it by the time we got to Illidan in BT. Although the nerf may have not affected tanking itself, either, since he used it because I believe the proc was good for threat generation (back when that still mattered lol)
---
The Corsair shirt was easier to get from the deadmines and had similar stamina and intellect but lacked the spirit stat
---
how to spot the casual lmao (: If you want TF on a rogue, you're better off doing pugs with the bindings reserved cause until at least 2-3 of your guilds tanks have TF, you won't be able to get it... Well, unless you're an officer or GM like the previous dude said.
---
Well both have nice parts in my eyes. İf you interested in numbers , you should go priest. They are best healers. But it's harder to level (compared to druid ofc) Shadow is not as efficient as kitten while grinding, but it is personal opinion because I like grinding with mage or any type of non mana users for faster mob grind. 
---
Druids are not as common as priests so for getting geared it is more fast. And priest it becomes mindless button spam after a while, while druid healing more challenging in raids. 
---
İf you are interested in pvp druid is good and fun, they are preferred in premades. Priest is good too but not as good or fun as druids since you can shapeshift and get (almost) every class 1vs1. 
---
(This part is bit personal and for some might be bit stupid but it effects my view tbh)
---
İf you gonna roll alliance priest it is best to roll a dwarf bc they get fearward. İt is really important in all raids so hardcore guilds might be a bit picky about it. And it is weird that all priests doesn't get it, I don't know about classic will be the same about it. But I prefer a nelf priest bc of the looks, if you roll a nelf get ready to be rejected in some guilds , even some dungeon groups
---
yes it is??
---
Both fist weapon set bonuses were garbage.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Source: had both
---
I've got 5 or so people interested in this, can you make a page and discord?
---
Man, I really miss TB :'( RIP
---
As a night elf I got exalted with Stormwind before 40, hit it in Swamp of Sorrows (pserver)
---
Server stability. If the servers can’t handle high player density, they will have to use sharding. It’s not even a question of mob competition or respawns, they will *have* to shard if the server is about to crash. 
---
Modern WoWs server infrastructure, using cloud technology, is very efficient for the current game. But it’s not built for Classic, where any zone can be stampeded with people.
---
And I’d hate to have sudden sharding in zones, that doesn’t belong in Classic... at all...I can tolerate it 1-10 though.
---
Feral tanking is always viable. It's maybe a little less optimal than warrior tanking for raids, but it's still plenty viable. They're amazing in dungeons.
---
I don't know if shaman healers will be more popular than priests, but shaman heals won't be fighting for gear any more than any other healer. 
---
For pure PvE shaman ... troll for berserking, maybe?
---
I'd love to be wrong. But I wont be
---
Troll for the spell haste.   Due to totems being group buffs, expect competition for gear vs 6 others doing the same thing.   
---
Do your Shaman first,  and your Druid will gear up quickly in alt runs,  otherwise prepare for the condescending pve outlook.  
---
Ignore if you are already in an established guild and you are not fighting for a regular raid slot.  
---
Best of luck,  
---
Signed,  
---
One of the other Shaman rolling on your gear
---
Lol you must be my biggest fan
---
Isnt the best strategy to get lvl 60 first, and then earn?
---
&gt; The usual rule is, "if it's fucking broken(but fun), then it works in ~~classic~~  vanilla"
---
FTFY
---
Pretty sure Blizzard is going to continue their trend of "fixing things" that aren't broken, even in Classic.
---
I'd say if you're not planning on doing a ton of raiding, go Druid. IMO they're more fun, and you'll get a real kick out of flag carrying in WSG.
---
Doesnt say anything about a guarenteed release in summer 2019
---
One is most likely going hunter, and the other is deciding between lock/druid. If druid it’ll be heals I think.
---
That's a different issue than payment method for an account subscription.
---
Auctioneer - I can't imagine trying to use the Auction House without it.
---
Gatherer - This remembers the location of every harvesting node you hit. If you have a gathering skill this one is a must. 
---
Bartender - Or any other bar mod to reconfigure the UI.
---
ItemRack - Makes switching gear sets way less annoying. Once you have different gear for PVP/PVE this saves a bunch of time. 
---
KLH ThreatMeter - As a tank, this is my favorite mod of all. It's valuable to both DPS and tanks to have it, as the tank can see when they need to push harder to keep above the DPS, and the DPS can see when they might want to slow down to prevent pulling aggro.
---
So it's been a long time so maybe I'm just remembering wrong, but I don't remember Black Arrow being a thing hunters had in vanilla. I remember it from WoTLK but I'm seeing it on like the Classic wow DB and [hunter skills by lvl](https://imgur.com/iduign8) thing that was just made. Am I missing something?
---
Looking for an East Coast US Guild (as well as any players from Manhattan - I live here and would love to know someone on the Island who is going to be playing classic).
---
I've been playing since mid TBC, but I am very excited to experience something as close to Vanilla as possible. 
---
I plan on playing 5ish hours 3 weeknights per week and just a disgusting amount on weekends.
---
I'm going to try to hit 60 quickly, but then I will likely be on the casual side of raiding with a demanding job + girlfriend (I try not to sleep so it should all work out).
---
Corsair shirt is +11 spirit and +5 stamina. It might’ve been patched in tbc.
---
[Thottbot.com](https://Thottbot.com) was a website, not an addon. Now it's no longer functional, and the url redirects to [Wowhead.com](https://Wowhead.com).

2. enemyFrames
---
3. ItemRack
---
R.I.P 1.12 addons you will be missed.
---
My guess is that by phase 3 something will be discovered to be completely busted and will get nerfed.
---
That or he went to Gnomeragan.
---
the legend of stalvan?
---
Hunter 0/21/30 is a legit spec. You need some serious fucking gear to pull off though.
---
so did this video convince them ?
---
I mean I've been playing on a Pserver and a bit of retail and that was one of the first things that jumped out at me. Yeah the low res textures look a little spandexy, but plate is made of plates in metal tones, cloth tends to look more...clothy.
---
OP that isn't a urban legend. I was on the same server as him. It was a Night Elf Druid named Kuroma on Dagger spine. He wasn't doing it to grief others. He thought there was a secret rank 15. I also know for a fact that multiple people played on his account 2 I know of for sure. Also all the people that played on his account including him were extremely low skilled players. They mostly afked.
---
He's actually level 38 elite in vanilla I believe
---
You would think we would have it by now. I really hope they announce it soon.
---
It was increased in later patches. I wasn’t in Ascent, I was in Fires of Heaven.
---
People need to stop saying this lmao
---
We're basically getting a modded version of retail wow to recreate classic wow
---
They aren't just Ctrl C Ctrl V releasing 1.12 client

**&lt;Moist&gt; NA PvE Horde Casual Raiding**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
Nothing is solidified just yet but we’re thinking a single organized raid night either Fridays or Saturdays, starting around 8-9 EST, for targeting 40 player content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule. 
---
**Contact:**
---
If you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day organization, then please message @Slaugth#9941 on discord.
---
Yeah it’s doable but during classic there wasn’t many people 2 manning instanced content.
---
I don't know how long there was between the announcement of the release day, and the actual day, but the first couple of expansions were 2 months notice.
---
So you still have a month.
---
#nochanges
---
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S2eefaypLK8GTbfJlVMsXFYSL2BsEQOQhBYy5LfMji0/edit?usp=sharing)'s the orc's (or troll's) guide to UC rep in spreadsheet form
---
I had a thought similar to this. Could build a melee/ranged hybrid if I take AP over Agility, which is good for solo hunter.
---
Not SL locks, nothing beats them 1v1.
---
Oh man, I was hoping he was like a dope as flag runner.   This saddens me.  I've seen videos where they mention a rank 15 that was never implemented, city defender.    You would get a free hearth to the honor hall or something.
---
I can remember C&amp;C so vividly and it's been I would say 20 years since I played it.  But I can't for the life of me remember what I had for dinner a week ago. haha
---
If you're not hot capped people can usually afford 2 pts into imp hawk
---
No dispel protection
---
Crunchy feels like a more appropriate adjective
---
There’s a Youtuber who uses Ravager at 60 for AoE Damage. He combines it with immolation trap and engineering items to pretty strong effect. You can even shoot arrows while channeling the proc, and the only thing that breaks it is swapping weapons.
---
why arcane missiles?
---
I remember, that's when that clicker add-on became super fucken popular.
---
Thanks everyone for your answers, so paladin seems the right choice for me!
---
Yeah but like you said it's certain situations, your gonna need consumables, engineering and less than stellar opponents.
---
Earthstrike is solo farmable if you don't raid AQ
---
I think the safest bet would be to ship without xrealm BGs, play it by ear and only use them as needed. For everything you mentioned afterwards --
---
* I wouldn't even be able to begin trying to revise the honor system if it has to mostly stay the same. It's thoroughly busted, we'll just have to deal with it
---
* DHKs are complicated since they're intrinsically wrapped up with an even-more-fucked honor system. Just making civilians player-immune would probably be better off in practice, if a bit 'modern-Wow-esque'
---
* I dunno what the point of meddling with the AQ event would be, I don't think pre-farming has ever been much of an epidemic 
---
* If a player wants a different UI they'll download an addon. I dunno what to say, if the aesthetic or functionality you want already exists in an addon, why would the game have to change for everyone 
---
* A few top guilds spending an extra fifteen minutes in MC before they whack Rag and move on isn't worth changing raid encounters for, most players will find it challenging enough and they're the ones who would actually be [potentially negatively] affected by any adjustments 
---
* Shuffling loot would be pointless; again, it's only a few players in the world that'll be temporarily inconvenienced. Everyone else will just use a database like Wowhead to know what's different after the top players have smashed through all of it, so it would ultimately accomplish little to nothing
---
Yeah, I think they might do bug testing at most. They also probably have no way to gauge how many players they have to prepare their servers for at launch.
---
ty very much for creating and sharing. Can you tell us how you stitched them together? Was it manualy into [Paint.net](https://Paint.net) or something or did you use automation tool?
---
Nobody really fucking knows, we won't find out until we actually test it. I hope they silently remove this "feature" from the game to nerf Humans / Orcs, the glancing blow bonus is enough
---
The remastered version is coming out sometime soon also
---
For sure. Everyone wants their healers happy in the long run. But it really didn't start happening in MC until we almost cleared BWL if my memory is to be trusted. Plus I was able to use my dkp to bid on items I wanted. Not sure what system will be used in classic.
---
My ret pally in classic will be my farming and pvp character. For raiding i'm going mage.
---
So that is what peak performance looks like...lol
---
  **&lt;Deus Vult&gt; NA, PvE server, Horde**   
---
**“Less Raids, Better Raids”**  
---
**Who we are:** Deus Vult is an 18+ English-speaking  guild which aims to level to 60 at our own pace, and progress through all the end-game raiding content World of Warcraft Classic has to offer while only raiding two nights a week.  
---
**When we play:** 40 man raids will be on **Fridays and Saturdays from 11 PM to 3 AM EST.**  
---
**Guild organization:** We are going to take a common sense approach to raid spot allocation and loot distribution using a **Loot Council** comprised of myself, the co-GM, and Centurions.  
---
**Players will not be penalized for missing raids every once in a while.**  Life happens, and we aren't children anymore.  Players instead will be rewarded for putting more effort into raid preparation, helping guild members and showing up on time and ready to pull at 11:00.  Consumables are recommended and encouraged, but not absolutely required until AQ40 and Naxxramas.  
---
**Guild Ranks will include:**  
---
**Social:** Casual player, or a non-raiding friend.  
---
**Zealot:** A full-fledged member of our core raiding team.  
---
**Templar:** The top performers of each class will be granted the rank of Templar.  You will receive priority invites to raids and priority on rare or very powerful epics. Excellent, but not perfect, raid attendance and use of consumables is expected.  
---
**Centurion:** Class leader.  Exceptional players who can coach others to be their best.  
---
**Primarch:** Main tank and Co-GM.  **He will receive all tanking upgrades before other tanks, including the guild's first Thunderfury.**  
---
**Emperor:** Simply put, I am in charge of the day-to-day boring stuff so we can all raid and have fun.

I don't know what the fuck you're projecting at me for, I was merely pointing out the numbers you're spouting don't make sense in the context you're using them.. The rest of the shit you're saying had nothing to do with that,  fuckin' conjecture
---
Dots -&gt; felhunter, destro -&gt; imp, destro pvp -&gt; suc, affli pvp -&gt; felhunter/ voidwalker
---
In raids felhunter for int buff/ counter or devour magic or imp for blood pact and constant dps in case the boss is moving alot.
---
Amen
---
This is the gold star answer right here. As long as your group includes a tank and a healer, your specific classes/specs don't really matter.
---
How does being heavy into PvP make so much gold?
---
These folks agree transmog isnt for classic.  Or do you want to argue with yourself?  Let them enjoy what they enjoy.
---
The Unforgiven Warriors 
---
US- Alliance 
---
Normal Server 
---
Casual/ Raiding Guild
---
The Unforgiven Warriors is a raiding guild from the Vanilla Days. We cleared all Tier 2 content in Vanilla and all raids in BC as a guild. The main tank was in top rated in the US servers. 
---
Many members of our core raiding group are picking WOW back up for the release of Classic. If you’re a new player or at least new to Classic, we are good at training and developing players. The set raid times are not set yet.
---
I cant wait to look like an idiot.
---
Humans look the goofiest in rag-tag gear like this.  Makes me want to reconsider rolling horde...
---
He was joking......
---
Saw an elemental shaman at start of fight. Clearly they were viable if the guild got the kill.
---
Private server values are wrong.
---
Sure, but they'd be close.
---
Like I said, fallacious but sound.
---
Just like your infinite uptime 100% activity situation on infinite hp mob.
---
Not really.
---
Evidence? It's not that hard to determine how much rep quest giver from &lt;faction&gt; should give for a standard quest.
---
Feral has a heavy time investment. Your strongest weapon slot item drops from gnomergan and has 3 charges. It is incredibly strong for both tank and DPS. You can easily use a dozen of them in a single night. You will likely get 2-3 per hour when farming them. This will be the case for your progression raiding for the entirety of vanilla, unless Blizzard decide to nerf the on-use effect while shapeshifted.
---
What, what? you're playing the wrong expansion.
---
Devouring plague is 3 mins cd btw, you can't "keep it up" , your damage rotation runs out of mana by the 3rd MB btw, then I guess all you'll be doing is wanding, if a shadow priest raids they only get to press 1 button and it's mindflay to apply weaving, you aren't allowed to dot bosses in 40 man raids ( there are more important debuffs).
---
And even if somehow your imaginary rotation actually functioned in vanilla you'd still not come close to the top dps classes, the only meter priests can top is healing.
---
Here ,get educated a bit : [https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx).
---
Shadow and arcane are fine for raids if you ask me
---
Starfire has always been the most viscerally satisfying spell to me. Moonfire isn't anything special but sounds amazing. Comboing them both together makes me fucking squint
---
But he will be very useful for that part right before Lucifron in MC...or for the whelps in BWL.
---
A particular level range? The gloves and staff Houndmaster drops in SM give a combined +90AP when fighting beasts. Crazy strong if you feel like grinding turtles or something for a few levels.
---
Some people don't appreciate how good it is
---
Not sure about that, since SW:P is a strong dot and mind flay is a channeled spell doesn't the opponent los-ing actually benefit the shadow priest? He can start healing himself too if the opponent takes the pressure off.
---
You didn't say anything about Zhevras in the post I was replying to. That sounds like a bottleneck.
---
Enjoy never getting to raid.
---
The first pally I saw in full judgement blew my mind.
---
&gt; It's not that hard to determine how much rep quest giver from &lt;faction&gt; should give for a standard quest.  
---
Okay. Present to me some specific quest reputation data from vanilla. How about Undercity rep, if you will?
---
Destruction warlock 100%.
---
Devouring Plagues is an undead priest only spell in vanilla lol
---
Most guides say orc shaman above all others for PvP, hardiness is just that good.
---
What's that top spell for lvl34? I recognize the picture, it just had been so long...
---
This combo scales pretty well
---
"No!!! A curse upon you, interlopers! The armies of the Lich King will hunt you down. You will not escape your fate..."
---
Elemental sharpening stone (2% crit) seems way better than instant poison, especially in a BS, or SF build or at a high gear level (since poisons scale with nothing) ... is that wrong?
---
also...my guild totally raided Strat+Scholo right after release as they were fucking hard before being tuned down to 5 mans not to mention we weren't even all 60 and had greens/blues.
---
Yup. New guy gotta get the attunement key to Rag.
---
Naa. Zeus never rose from the dead. Try Jesus. But then again, that word is pronounced "hey Zeus" originally and is still pronounced that way in some languages.
---
You can skip alot of crap.   Ie, if you mine, in wintergrasp, stealthing in caves for rich thorium veins, get those arcane crystals.  Avoid alot for elites.
---
Based on your replies, I'd say go druid.  You can do every role leveling up,  lots of gear to farm, tons of utility a high ceiling to improve your skills.
---
Awesome cast as usual.
---
I just have some corrections about the timeline that I messed up a bit.
---
Corrections: there were 7 weeks between the release of the Honor System and BGs (I said a month, which is actually the time between the BG patch 1.5 and BWL patch 1.6). 
---
However, Dishonorable Kills (DKs) were released with the BG patch. So I still believe Phase 2 will only be a month long because of DKs and the Honor System.
---
(This is why I'd support no DKs in Phase 2 and have a Phase 2.5 with BGs and DKs.)
---
Soulfire
---
I think you are missing Zuluhed-US on the server list!
---
No worries mate, I’ll throw this on the discord too :)
---
Oh man you are screwed in phase 2
---
If you guild can't clear raids because you have a Ret Paladin or Ele Shaman in the group, they're just making excuses.
---
Ah yes remember using this many times back in TBC when I was bored farming honor in AV.
---
You have nothing to fear except fear itself ... plus death coil ... and howl of terror.
---
This is a confirmation that they are not letting unlimited debuffs roll on a boss. This is what they were talking about.
---
They never said it'll start with 16 debuffs.
---
Really dude?
---
They said it like, 3 or more times. They said during blizzcon, on the forums...
---
Imagine using that rogue example and just conveniently forgetting prot warriors in vanilla lmao. Holy shit how biased can you get? 
---
This is the type of person that people criticise when talking about vanilla wow and rose tinted glasses, just conveniently forget about issues in vanilla.
---
If you are on the giving end sure, if you are around 50 you can't be outside of instances or bigger cities as you will be farmed for honor, when you finally arrive back at your corpse the same few persons drops by just a few seconds after you resurrect since they know the approximate time it takes to corpse run, after this team has farmed you for enough honor the second or the third kill team usually finds you. Fighting back takes several times their number as they are equipped with epiq mount, healers and double enginering, often 1-2 shotting you with fatass frostbolts crits or a mortal strike to the face, if you get them low enough they chug potions and healthstones if their healer did not save them, and belive me they are prepared, with consumables up their ears, voice communication giving them far superior coordination. Traveling from eastern kingdoms to kalimdor can take som extra 30 min if you are dumb enough to travel through menethil and they successfully pin you down.  
---
It would have been a lot more fun if it was this way but your factions kill team also circled the same zones, problem is they avoid eachother as getting into a lenghty fight is not the optimal way to farm honor, meaning your faction is doing the exact same thing but to their 50's. It is infuriating to say the least being farmed for honor.  
---
I will be level 60 by the time it hits and wont have much problem, but I think a lot of people in their 50's will have a really tough time getting most of anything done. Either they go inside an instance, hang around the faction capital or log out.  
---
I feel like there should be some kind of better solution like making the flight path buff last longer if you are cc'd, atleast giving you some kind of chance to escape. I realise this experience i have had was from private servers but since the most optimal way of grinding honor is to farm 50's and camp flightpaths I'm quite confident we will see the exact same thing. Or 47-59 gives way less honor then 60's, making the 60's far more valuable then the lower 50's as it stands now.
---
Oh shit, I played with you a few weeks ago dude. I think it was an Sfk or bfd run.
---
They elaborated more in the full panel; the plans (as of right now) are to have 16 debuffs for the entirety.  You can find posts 5 months ago here discussing it
---
it's a shame to see all these glorious vanilla heroes forced to be rendered in the new models/animations.
---
i cant believe they removed the option to use old models -- final nail in the coffin for me.
---
Sounds fun until your wiping on the same boss for 2 months. Gl but depending on how many "memespecs" you allow you will struggle unless your serious and focused players just carry them.
---
Yea, I remember that :)
---
This is also related to the Diablo 4 / Diablo Immortal debacle at Blizzcon. It became apparent that Blizzard had planned to announce Diablo 4 at Blizzcon and announce Diablo Immortal along with it. That would've been okay for most people. When they couldn't announce Diablo 4 on time, and all fans got was Diablo Immortal, all hell broke loose.
---
Ayy that's what's up. I just hit 40 at 6 days played and got my mount. I'm a happy lil mage.
---
back in the day it was
---
* titan panel
---
* ct raidassist
---
* decursive
---
Love hearing these stories! Like a peek behind the scenes. Please share some more. :)
---
I really wish I had experienced the blood plague. I thoroughly enjoyed the zombie plague later on during the scourge invasion. I laughed myself silly during that!
---
I have been slowing wayyyy down, and just PvP'ing in Hillsbrad. I don't want to get burnt out on the grind before Classic releases.
---
The trick is once I started spinning, I realized what I wanted it to land on. It did not land on what I wanted though. This game is ruined for me now.
---
Reminds me of the macro rogues would have that went emote "Silentknife has pickpocketed 13 silver, 22 copper from \*player\*." Oh the whispers I'd get from lower level dudes in cities and towns.
---
Being at the leading edge pushing to take down brand new exciting content has that effect on people. We usually had 60 show up every night when we started raiding MC, and had to pair them down to a solid 40. Only ever had problems getting enough priests, everything else came in abundance.
---
Nope. The proc was fun but they were garbage weapons even when they proc'd.
---
I had a set on both my hunter and warrior and used to use them randomly in raids to get a good laugh, but that was it.
---
The amount of goobers that thing raids didnt have Hunters or Druids is out of hand.
---
can you elaborate? why is ELE op in pvp?
---
Yeah, I know that feel. I've haven't been playing every day myself. Although, the whole reason for me playing on the server is to get some practice for the classic drop. I'm still not sure if my guild is going horde or alliance.
---
Damn... If I ever got (get?) rank 14. The first thing I'll do after buying the weapons is take a break for BGs and WoW in general.
---
Play like 2 hours a day tops for a good while
---
You say that like spamming frost bolt is fun.
---
I really hope snowballs work the way they did back in vanilla. Knowing Blizzard I have my doubts but one can dream... Almost choked laughing when I snowballed my friend exiting UC lift at the top. He was knocked down and the door shut just right in front of him, and because of the knockdown the lift actually left under him with him staying in the air for a moment only to fall to his death.
---
Source on then confirming it wont be delayed?
---
Righteous Might was alliance and we were at most 1-2 days behind on all content. Who can forget Feldhake, our GM who was 2nd? 60 on the server as a pally.  Good times, I miss trying to figure out new content without a youtube video telling you how to do it. No one had done it before, it was truly magical. No addons telling you what to do, you just wipe and read logs and try things until you figure out what works.
---
You are not playing because of that? Blows the mind.
---
Bro you need a wolf for that melee buff. Then you'll be taken seriously.
---
I still play but I think the new models are complete shit
---
Fel Hunter is your main go-to in PvP, Imp in PvE. Theres obviously situations for all of them, but Fel Hunter you mainly want because its really good against casters and Eat Magic can remove a lot of CCs as well as Paranoia to spot Rogues. Succ is good mainly against melee and CC if youre outnumbered, thats assuming the Seduce doesnt get removed in a group fight though. 
---
Imp in PvE for Blood Pact and a bit of DPS, pretty much all the time in raids. You might use Succ in 5mans for CC sometimes.
---
My brother and I ran Gnomeregan around level 30 (maybe 35?) with him playing priest and I playing frost mage. It was super fun. I don’t think we got to the end boss but it felt like a fun challenge.
---
When tier 0.5 came out one of our rogues went through the quest line and we sold the timed Stratholm runs with 2 combat rogues, a healing druid, and whoever bought the service. As the druid, I would lead them on a path around the mobs and they weren’t allowed to do anything other than follow me to avoid them messing up our strategy. I loved that so much and it was a good source of gold to pay for raiding cost. 
---
I raided a fair bit and enjoyed that a lot but I think the most fun were silly dungeon runs.
---
No one raided with full single life consumables while progressing in the fight initially.
---
Pserver raiders have the benefit of not having to learn anything. It’s feasible to run in there full buffs and 1 shot it all. Hell its even reasonable to bring a stack of each consumable. 
---
Progressing on Cthun back in the day meant 10-30 wipes a night (depending on wipe protection and running back) and if you were a top raider like EJ was you’d be in there 4-5 nights a week. 
---
Progressing in full buffs is nonsense.
---
I'd say go ahead and go mining/engineering from the start. Some of the engineering items are REALLY good for the level you can unlock them, and you can make money selling crafted arrows pretty quickly.
---
Randy, is it you?
---
i have plenty of reasons not to play, but this is one of those changes that i remember when i think about if i should try playing again and causes me to lose all desire or curiosity.
---
Both are kings in dueling. Group pvp I’d lean warlock as priests are needed more for heals and dispels. Either is fine if you’re out wpvping or doing random bgs.
---
why wouldnt it be a vanilla cake
---
I’ve never seen a vanilla lava cake, call me when you find one.
---
Downvoted because you can't do it, lol.
---
The argument against having the OPTION for updated models or graphics on YOUR screen is just silly. You should be able to have the 100% classic experience and the option for an updated option if you choose. I’ve been playing vanilla on pservers for years and I’ve played with updated models and without. I would enjoy having the option to experience classic with an updated look.
---
Sap
---
Do you know how much? Lol
---
Shaman race is almost totally irrelevant for PvE. Tauren might actually be the best because there are quite a lot of AoE groups that can be stunned and War Stomp is really good in those situations. Some might think Troll Berserking is all right for heals, but it triggers your global, so you pretty much lose as much casting time as you gain. Healers rarely get stunned in raids so Orc doesnt really do anything. But yeah, even if you plan to PvP even casually, Id roll Orc, it makes a world of difference.
---
Its not so much that Druid tanking falls behind, its that there just not really good enough from the start of raids. They just flat out take more damage from start to end. MC it isnt so bad, BWL gets worse, AQ40 gear makes it a little better and in Naxx it kind of settles back down again.
---
Shamans from what ive seen are not TOO popular for raiding from what ive seen on pservers. I think theyre pretty average in terms of fighting over loot.
---
Just track and ban. It completely defeats the game if allowed to take hold. Fucks the economy. No. No. 
---
Ban and ban again.
---
Region loc + vpa ban, solved
---
If you are even a little bit interested in PvP performance on any class, engineering is a must. Even if you ignore everything else engineering has to offer, [Iron](http://classicdb.ch/?item=4390)/[Thorium Grenades](http://classicdb.ch/?item=15993) are the bee's knees.
---
Mages have two versions of all the teleports; A personal [Teleport](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=3566) and party/raid usable [Portal](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=11420).
---
Yeah it didn't work that way in vanilla.  Woulda made it the most mana efficient spell in the game by a mile.
---
Rank 1 Frostbolt. Cast time was so short to get chilling effect on player in PvP
---
It won't be the authentic Vanilla experience if I don't see a gold farmer.
---
Ideally 2 healers, 1 flag carrier (Druid/prot), 2 arms warriors, a mage (conjure and trinket/Pom for insta gibs or flag carriers) 
---
Last four slots can go to general dps.
---
Or 3 dps and a ret/ele/enh sham—something that could off heal without form shifting (spriest/feral/moonkin).
---
While I agree, blizzard is trying to automate everything and with that it's much easier to circumvent bans
---
I loved the gun sound, never wanted bows 😉
---
Stop trying to scam people of r/gamesale
---
If I just moan do I get one?
---
Dwarf is master race, what's so hard?
---
Most gear is pretty obvious as to which classes/specs it should go to, once you know what each class/spec is looking for in their gear. For starters: 
---
Warrior tanks want weapons that are as fast as possible, with Stamina, Defense, or Chance to Hit. There are arguments both for and against giving the main tank priority on these weapons over Rogues/Fury Warriors. 
---
Bear tanks get items with +Armor. 
---
Plate is easy: Paladins get all the healing gear, DPS Warriors get all the physical DPS gear. 
---
Hunters get first pick on all ranged weapons, with Rogues and Warriors getting a shot if no Hunters need them.
---
Such an awesome part of Vanilla. 
---
Less effective less damage but this guy enjoyed the flavour of duel wielding so he duel wielded to 60.  👍. 
---
Coming up next, drunken brawl levelling - unarmed while maintaining your character in a drunken state all the way to 60. Total garbage and it’ll take you an age to level but so cool that you CAN if you want.
---
I really want to bear tank, but not top tier current raid level of tanking. So, I've decided I'm just going to level a tauren druid tank as an alt for dungeons and an herbalism/alchemy character, so I can permanently leave it specced with optimal tanking talents. A priest for healing PvE and PvP content (my actual main), and a skinning/mining mage for gold farming to complement the tailoring/eng on my priest. Going to split leveling equally until they are all around mid 30's, then just ride out the rested xp on my mage/druid after that, while focusing my time on my priest. I accepted exactly what you're saying about druid. I only want to bear tank for PvE and nothing else, so I am only going to do that. I just understand that being a non-flexible druid and maining druid is a bad combo. People like to act like it's a massive waste of time to level alts for gold making, but as long as you're patient with utilizing rested xp, having a character permanently specced to be as efficient as possible is worth a lot of gold as far as a time investment ratio to gold income is concerned. Kind of went off on a tangent lol.
---
They are still a thing nowadays too! I expect to see them here aswell
---
Elemental is Fire and Frost, which has burst and defensive utility. But conflag lock is certainly more burst than elemental- pom pyro is the burst mage spec.
---
If I could have a single change for classic it would be to fix Druid weapons
---
Indeed, I don't see Zuluhed on this list.
---
nope. vanilla had chinese gold farmers, and they added an interesting element to the game. people camped them, befriended them, made memes about them, etc.
---
adding wow tokens means people buy epic mounts, BoE epics, fiery cores, etc. this kills the classic.
---
Beeserker Rage giving more rage when suffering damage. This mechanic felt so amazing it almost brings tears to my eyes thinking about it. Also slam, this beautiful rage efficient cast melee attack with this beautiful noise. I loved it all ❤️
---
If anyone is curious about the music - it’s The beastie boys - Shambala, from (my personal favorite) instrumental album of theirs “The in Sound from Way Out
---
Or blink
---
Easy explanation: Several dudes ranked him to 14 and after that several dudes wanted to play said rank 14.
---
Getting 1000g at 60 isn’t trivial. It’s not unreasonable to be playing regularly, upgrading gear and such and not have the gold together by the time dire mail comes out.
---
I have evidence that suggests our values are very wrong, but I wasn't the guy saying it's not hard to find data on it, so I was waiting for his follow up.
---
I am so ready. And so keen!
---
I wasn't very well geared so in a duel I died a lot against Hunters; just when their kiting combo went out and I could have done some damage my HP went empty 😉 I hated Hunters the most back then. My hate for druids never stopped.
---
Just have 39 other dwarves in the raid, problem solved
---
I hope tokens aren’t in as gold is so important in Classic. 
---
However, if they are in; as a full time working husband I’ll be shamelessly buying them up. 
---
Which is kind of sad as I still remember the moment 15 years ago when I’d finally scraped together enough gold for my epic mount. 
---
Unfortunately, having tokens in wouldn’t surprise me based upon the very transparent lack of support staff and Blizzard long term goal of Classic Wow automation and playing wakka Mole with gold sellers doesn’t sound like something Blizzard wants to recreate. 
---
I know being on the Legion tech will mean much better security than pservers and Vanilla but let’s be honest they’ll find a way.
---
What makes DP bad scaling, does it get bad returns from spellpower?  I thought it looked pretty good, for pvp at least.
---
What a gorgeous boy
---
I just want to know one thing which spec or build of all classes can 1 vs x opponents of 2 and 3? Does one exist? Where it could be pulled off even with competent players around?
---
Hopefully they add a toggle.
---
I want to quest NE zones for Darnassus rep as I level up my human paladin so I can ride a kitty mount as soon as possible. How difficult would that make it to train skills as I'm leveling? Is it usually possible to get through full zones between trips to the trainer, or will I feel mega underpowered if I'm not taking trips to Stormwind every level up?
---
requires pink AQ shoulders
---
agi on crowd pummeler ayy
---
Wait, I'm a woman and I play horde... does this mean I'm actually a man?
---
Good mages are always highly valued.
---
Dwarf priests are always highly valued.
---
RIP TB
---
I feel most at home when M.M.A. references leak over into my W.o.W. sub-Reddit.
---
I’m pretty sure as alliance if you /say d a p ee bb it shows up as y o u lo se to the horde
---
Jeez I don't know if I could take that kind of grueling grind to 60 🤦🏻‍♂️.
---
But honestly I felt like DW had its perks that made it worthwhile. Less reliant on having a great weapon with bloodthirst and rage generation, it was also nice to finish off mobs at 1% without waiting 3.5+ seconds for the swing timer to come
---
around. I love flurry, especially cus I stack agility while leveling, it's good with a 2her as well but it has more uptime with DW.
---
I also played human which definitely helped with the miss chance and glancing blows.
---
Can you elaborate why you stole $30 from me?
---
Apparently Pserver faction rep gains are wrong. Could anyone confirm this?
---
It might not be possible to get exalted at 40.
---
This is awesome. Thanks. I assume this are okay to use freely?
---
I'm pretty sure they will be updating the anti-cheat program to key on gold buying.
---
haha you motherfucker
---
they should put in a little plaque for tb somewhere, i know i want no changes but it would be super nice
---
Exactly my point. I don't want tokens and I agree with you. This was the point I was trying to convey.
---
uhhh which one are you talking about?? im on atlas loot rn and dont see anything
---
Yes, last month's post even made sure it'll be releasing on summer, no delays
---
I played a lot of spriest PVP in vanilla, was the 2nd priest on my server to get Anathema while raiding as holy into Naxx, when I was a full-time shadow DPS / buffer.
---
I got into plenty of PVP pre-mades -- that never should be an issue if you establish a reputation as a team player. Defend points in Arathi using tankyness and Mind Control to buy time. Be a distraction and defend the flag runner in WSG, DOT everything and use your beams to encourage focus fire in AV.
---
On the PvE side, raid gear for Spriests is pretty hard to come by, I used the pvp set as it was better until I got some AQ40 pieces. Spriests don't scale very well, so it didn't go so far, but it was fun and I got to do two roles on one class. That's my memory.
---
There are hundreds of items? What do you want a list of priority for each?
---
It depends on the individual items’ statistics, what item type it is, etc. but more importantly is knowing every other item. 
---
Is Staff of Dominance good for priests? Certainly. But should they get priority over mages/locks/druids? No because priests get benediction 1 boss later
---
Then there is guild philosophy on gearing. Does the guild believe in using loot like a patronage system? Or meritocratic? Or perhaps they are selective over their members, so we can assume the skill floor is quite high—if that’s the case, give it to the person who gets the biggest and likely most long term benefit from the item. Or what about the idea of gear your tanks first, healers second dps third. Or maybe tanks dps heals. 
---
There are a lot of considerations, but at the end of the day they are 16 year old purple pixels. If the purpose of acquiring the loot-But-not-really-since-you-don’t-own-it-and-it-isn’t-real-in-the-first-place isn’t to kill the next boss once or the current boss faster, what’re you doing it for?
---
So that said, if you app to a LC guild, review the loot appropriations, if it doesn’t look like they are issuing loot to maximize benefit ask questions, if the answers are not satisfactory—leave.
---
buying gold from a chinese man always carries the risk of a ban so less people are likely to do it. Blizzard offering the option to buy gold is stupid with no consequences other than destroying the economy and giving the people with deep pockets a way to advance.
---
Here's your complimentary cock and neckbeard, enjoy!
---
I'm one of the people who feels, however, that "if everyone is special, then *no one* is special..." Seeing a person with most or all of a raid set really impressed, back in the day. You'd see people huddled around a stationary raider inspecting their gear in awe as though they were inspecting alien technology that no one had ever seen before.
---
Granted, with the Internet in its current state, many of these items will have lost that degree of mystique. Those who manage to deck out, however, will still inspire.
---
I'd grind all day in that Battle for Azeroth
---
omnicc, bartender, enemy castbar, klh threatmeter, dbm, x-pearl, scrolling combat text, energy regtimer, stuntimer, outfitter, ctmods, gatherer, auctioneer, atlas, atlasloot.

Have you tried doing that? I bet you will end up with some variant of the "standard" specs. There is already a decent amount of talent switches you do while staying within the "meta". And no matter what you do you want either Mortal strike or Bloodthirst, leaving you little choice in what to branch out into different trees.
---
To further elaborate a typical warrior pvp situation: you want to start battle, you dismount and want to charge (battle stance) but due to some bug or because someone with higher range you are in combat, you then have to use blood rage (to generate rage instantly) and change to berserker stance to use intercept on your desired target; you then swap back to battle stance (or delay that to use the first hit's rage to use mortal strike) because you don't want to suffer the enhanced damage. If the enemy ia casting, you have to switch to berserker stance to pummel, if you are there maybe get a whirlwind in as well, maybe he dodged an attack, you then change to battle stance for overpower etc.
---
This exact opening happened so often for me back then it is imprinted into my memory. It was warsong the first clash and me picking out druid healers most of the time 😊 I loved their soft flesh.
---
If she wants to kill monsters, play any of them—they are all 1-3 button rotations during extended combat in a raid.
---
If she wants to exist in the world hunter and paladin are pretty safe. 
---
But really, if you want her to play, encourage her to play the class/race fantasy she likes the best. It’s vanilla, it’s all pretty simple to understand. But it’s a long haul—if you hate your character you won’t make it to cap.
---
Hop onto our discord. Happy to discuss anytime. Happy for those to play what they enjoy (except horde) . We will be running two raid groups with our numbers.
---
Probs the most minmaxy thing you could do lol
---
(No idea why my replies make new threads sorry)
---
The vast majority of warriors refuse to tank. Tanks will always be in shortage—it’s a truism if mmos.
---
I dont mean to provoke and I know I'll be crucified. But I truly think the new models just take getting used to and you'll enjoy them. Not everyone of course, but they grew on me. SLOWLY. Now I quite like them, except male night elf...
---
That being said, the old models have a charm I'm happy to revisit
---
Manual crowd pummeler
---
I loved the guild's philosophy and the raid schedules. I don't love the faction, but It's not that much an issue.
---
Couple questions:
---
\- Are you willing to accept foreigners that do speak good enough english?
---
\- Are you playing on a heavy populated/streamer server or going to emptier ones?
---
I would rather pour the juice of 10 plump lemons into my eyes and stick my cock in a food processor than even consider looking at the retail login screen, but you do you.
---
What are the easiest classes to gear up? Deciding between hunter, warlock, and dagger rogue, and one factor is how much competition I'll have getting gear in a raid (will I need to see an item 8 times before I actually grab it, or only on average 2-3?)
---
Dude.
---
 The helmet is the best part... And a cloak would make it even better.
---
Might be private server no clip.
---
It would be easy to remove the quest, I would love to see the npc personally.
---
They’re boring as fuck, in my opinion. Could be a sentiment shared.
---
Warriors of any spec can tank up to and including parts of brd without much trouble.
---
And unless you’re bringing two warriors to a 5 man (which is retarded on behalf of the prot—who is often the group leader) the warrior can and should be tanking, unless it’s a rare case with a Druid tank. 
---
The easiest way to gear as a warrior—especially horde side—is to play prot and roll need on all the fury and prot gear. Cause your only competition should be a rogue or hunter for any leather/mail items and it isn’t too tough to get 3 clothier friends.
---
Gold management is such a huge element of the game in vanilla, tokens would seriously fuck things up.
---
I also don't believe the "people are going to buy gold either way" thing. Sure it's true to an extent, there are always going to be people who buy gold no matter what, but the threat of a ban is enough to keep honest people from doing it. I have plenty of disposable income and have always been bad at gold management in games, yet I've never purchased 3rd-party gold because *it's cheating*, it's a bannable offense, and it supports hacking and gold farmers.
---
Ms puts up a debuff—a high priority debuff. There are only 16 debuff slots in vanilla. You don’t want MS tanking up one.
---
Thats the common opinion around here, that you have to be HARDCORE to do well in raids. No, you don't. You can do all the content as long as you try. The common player has to deal with WAY more complicated mechanics this day and age. Food and in combat potions may be required, flasks not so much. If you have all 3 on your 40 man raid you will do fine. Its a numbers game, and with better machines and internet you will see better performance.
---
Technology has come a long way since 2005. They should be well equipped to deal with them more efficiently these days. Also, implementing the token won't eliminate or even slow gold farmers down. They will still exist. 
---
Hard no for me.
---
Jesus. He still plays?
---
Are you planning on rolling on a heavy populated/streamer server or on a lower pop one?
---
If you want to play a game with tokens, retail is still available by all means go there.
---
Probably a mix of dkp and need. I like attendance score and need. If you show up often you are reliable so i wouldnt have a problem wirh you receiving loot.
---
Do a holy/prot build for reckoning! In pvp it's pretty fun because you are healing and still an effective damage dealer when you need to burst. Get a slow 2h for it, it's a great build.
---
&gt;It's not just about blind recreation for the sake of it, the longer game ticks and the old debuff refreshing system added significant depth to the game.
---
&gt;Sure, they shouldn't recreate bugs for the sake of recreating them if those bugs really are detrimental to the game, but the two examples you gave are terrible because they're not bugs nor do they cause any real issues, in fact, I would argue that these kind of core systems are just about the most important thing to preserve in a recreation.
---
On the other hand, not having those limitations would also add "depth" to the game. It would change how the game is played a little bit. But it would not make it a different game, it would be like going from 1.8 vanilla to 1.12, or something like that. But now we are instead going from 1.12 to 1.13. We are going to have some things that are different no matter what, so I suggest we just embrace it and make it work well.
---
You regenerate healthier faster too, like 30% or something.
---
Oh man I was not aware of this, this is hilarious. Definitely unintended, and will probably be nerfed soon. It's an armor passive that makes you heal in ghost wolf form, it's probably scaling with something it's not supposed to. Boy those comments are dramatic though
---
yeh, it has a very bad spell coefficient because it also heals you.
---
When classic was **first** announced, I thought this would work. Without thinking about it I just figured -- Just have token, it's basically like buying gold (and that was in classic) -- no problem.
---
But after **really** thinking about it -- it has *so* many implications on the game.
---
If a raid expects players to have max consumes, you're talking like a token+ a week in Gold they have to spend. You could have guilds just dropping cash on token to get flasked up. This destroys the farming dynamic in Classic -- and destroys the 'social member' dynamic of raiding guilds. 
---
And that's just one example.
---
You also change how people min/max for their lv40 mount, and how they save for their epic mount, and how many players have 2nd accounts.
---
And you start changing how the markets work. Token is a cross-realm price in retail. It helps normalize the retail markets. This shouldn't be the case in classic, either.
---
That is unconfirmed and pure speculation
---
I have quite literally never got it later than 42 on any character, ever, in 16 years. Aaaaand only at 42 if I’m pumping engineering.
---
It is unfathomable to me what people waste their money on.
---
They used to have a toggle but it caused issues that they apparently couldn't fix so they removed it.
---
Thats how my guild is. We have 2 known females who talk, we just talk mechanics and how to improve during raid. No one makes inappropriate comments, no one treats them special, they are raiders same as the boys. It makes things SO much easier when you dont have to offend the officer who is crushing on the guild queen, and white knighting like an asshole, to the detriment of the guild. Drama.
---
Landing a bash on an Orc.
---
As you need 8 geared tanks for 4horsemen, and 1h maces/swords have competition, keeping 1-2 of your warriors as 2h fury can lead to better utilization of loot and higher dps in practice.
---
I’d you have a lot of warriors in your guild, not including rogues, hunters, Ret/Enh. To get them the best weapons, you’ll want different players looking for different weapons as opposed to 12 people looking for  Brutality Blade or CTS.
---
A person who knows how to play a warlock with their own custom build and not a cookie cutter build is 100% the best class in the game for pvp, I have my own build and know how to play lock, I promise u, the only class that can beat u in a 1v1 is a shadow priest. Have fun destroying as a lock.
---
To add on this formula with 0% to hit dual wielding is like a 20% bonus. So if you have a 40 dps two hander and two 40 dps one handers you would deal approximately 20% more damage with dual wield auto attacks.
---
This is offset by a two handed weapon of the same quality having more baseline dps. The standard level 60 weapons had 54 dps two hand and 41.5 dps one hand if i remember correctly. This is 30% more damage from the two hander normally.
---
But attack power is applied to one and two handers the same way so you are basically doubling your attack power bonus by dual wielding or more correctly increasing it by approximately 20% which then balances things out.
---
Tl;dr of this is: of you have crappy overall gear but can manage to get a good weapon a 2h spec is favorable. If you have a lot of strength on your gear this will strengthen a dual wield spec more.
---
I haven't really given it much thought. I'm open to leaving it to the group. I guess if I had to pick probably a lower pop one but not too low if that makes sense.
---
Scatter Shot / Intimidation Hunter
---
Soul Link Warlock
---
Deep Frost / Imp CS Mage
---
Depends on class. Anything under 6 days is fast. Most are easily doable in 7-9 if you know what to do, and don’t get obsessive over instance drops that just wont.
---
Greetings, friend!
---
They’ll have the database values, timings, sequences, assets all that stuff that is storable in bulk. 
---
What they won’t have is the “code” that pieces it all together because, unfortunately, it was treated as a living document and their version control was less than stellar. Most likely due to the team sizes at blizzard at the time. 
---
You can however throw an encounter together pretty rapidly if you have an idea of the sequence and timings. It’s getting it to its actual vanilla state that might take some serious tweaking, because there WILL be undocumented minor changes that got through in the rush. I’ve been there. 
---
Just a guess.
---
I didn't start playing until Wrath, and even then I didn't play Warrior until after Cata, so I've never really seen the old warrior talent trees to be honest. I just want to go into Classic not necessarily referencing a build whenever I need to allocate talent points, considering all I've done since I started playing was follow builds.
---
Sub 80 sounds very impressive. The just under 5 number was like normal play with an optimized route. 
---
I wonder how much better the route gets and what...non intuitive gameplay one has to get up to in order to do it in a lil over 3 days.
---
Huge sigh. I was there, it was hard. It’s all relative.
---
Sure, add token.  
---
Classic will be a ghost town, but yeah dude add them in.
---
Wow you said this but for srs
---
LMAO that god awful UI.
---
I understand this opinion, but I still feel like there isn’t a need for them in classic.  It sort of defeats the purpose of the whole feel of the game.  Yeah I understand it doesn’t effect gameplay, but that doesn’t matter.  They have a vision for classic, and new models doesn’t align with that vision.
---
Oh no of course, they absolutely shouldn't and wouldn't be in Classic. I was just talking about the bashing of them on this subreddit when referring to Retail
---
Yeah Necromancer is a much cooler theme than Death Knight.
---
? I did my warrior in k3 launch in under 8 and that was intentionally not going fast (I ran instances multiple times, for instance) 
---
6-7 is a safe number for an experienced person playing the game 1-60 again. 
---
I assume experienced doesn’t mean “I’ve played live wow since launch” it means “I’ve leveled multiple classes on multiple factions multiple times on live and pserver vanilla”
---
Lol @ July release. I'm sticking with late August/September
---
That's definitely fine for levelling. I would still suggest planning a bit though (in game after launch if nothing else), because it's not like you want to just pick whatever talents in the next tier you like. Some are really important to work towards, especially the level 40 talents (which can be solved by respeccing at 40, but still). Most talents in the warrior tree are just filler you take to get to the important ones. 
---
Warrior can also be a complete pain to level, so actually doing some research about what can be done with different talents is imo a good idea. Even while levelling.
---
I had to see for myself. Zoom in on the screen capture link from RedTempest. You can clearly see the tail on the bottom of the letter t from Osconty. There is No tail on the letter l in July. It is not Juty. It is July.
---
I would argue out of those 3, Hunter would be easiest to gear up. Typically a 40 man raid doesn't take too many hunters.  You have access to both leather and mail gear to use, and besides warriors and rogues using ranged weapons as stat sticks, your main weapon is essentially for your class only.  Also you can mix and match your melee weapons depending on what drops you happen to get.  Also competition for your tier set will obviously be easier with so few hunters per raid.  Casters such as warlock have to compete with one another for every piece of spell power gear and rogue is typically a commonly picked class who also needs to fight tooth and nail over their tiers, weapons, and leather gear.  Hope that helped give you an idea of what to expect :D
---
Did they change this after vanilla? I have always been under the impression spells as spapshot when they leave your hand, not when they impact the target. 
---
But I played a spriest in retail old world, so my spells didn’t have travel times, so I’m not really sure.
---
Enchants don’t work, but there are some weapons whose effects actually do work while in bear form.
---
I don’t know if every one works, but weapons that say “equip: do x” actually still proc in bear form, whereas weapons that say “chance on hit: do y” do not.
---
So yeah, some procs do work, but most don’t. You’re better off just getting a stat stick and throwing a juicy enchant on it.
---
I don't like the idea of making gold buying an acceptable part of the culture. 
---
It's paying to advance, which should be frowned upon and those who do it should be willing to risk a suspension.
---
Let's not do a 180 on that.
---
1) We accept all players, regardless of their language. We'll work with you.
---
2) A couple of the other NA-PvP guild GMs and I have been in conversation on the topic of servers. Our goal is to avoid the steamer servers and create our own community, drawing the attention of other like minded players. More details to follow once they release server names (and a release date.)
---
I hope to bring a whole mongol horde of rogues through a starter zone...
---
If you avoided garrisons after the intro quest you could level just fine in WoD. I hit maxlevel day two.
---
Rip all your gold.
---
&gt; classic wow Imo needs the wow token   
---
  no fuck off
---
Odds are, in the short term, grinding gold on your main will be more effective than the alt miner (since you will have to invest in leveling him). By the time you get around to getting the alt good to go (because if you are as ambitious as you sound, you’ve got a lot of work to do on your main) the ah prices will have leveled out, making the savings from the alt less.
---
Because they're expecting first zone sharding, mob/item values, countless class mechanics and AI behaviors to all work first try on a backported modern client. 
---
Despite the fact that people had instantly found and pointed out dozens of glaringly obvious issues with the demo that included an extremely tiny portion of the game.
---
gank all hunters using herods shoulders, absolute haram.
---
Thanks a bunch! Prepare for lots of 'what has been seen' moments.
---
I don’t mind them for retail (besides the new upright orcs, as a long time Warcraft lover this is disgusting imo).  And yeah there is nothing wrong with liking them obviously, and I would assume the outrage about have less to do with the actual suggestion and more so to do with the volume of retail-esq suggestions.  People are tired of hearing about all these ‘cool new and bright’ things that should come into classic and just bash and shit on anything and everything about retail to try to drown out the volume of nonsense requests. 
---
That’s just what I would guess though.
---
"can i do a lvl 30 instance as X spec?"
---
If you can 2 man it with the right classes it should be doable with 5 in any spec
---
Lol we had a warrior on alliance on Terenas named Nodomino that kept GM for pretty much the entire duration of vanilla. Dude really was a total prick to interact with.
---
ez dismount
---
Is it just me or isn’t that a shield that was in the TBC from a quest in zangarmarsh?
---
Blizzard is one of the few game companies that actually makes Mac optimized games. That being said MBAs don’t have a graphics card soooooooooooooooo
---
Gladly paying my own FICA for the freedom to play wow for a week straight.
---
Blizz's CS team has been severely reduced lately. Forum mods don't exist and it's almost entirely automated, in game chat also seems to have almost no moderation and appears to also be automated - so both of these situations mean you can post whatever you want and not get silenced/banned, or at least not for a day or so when someone gets to it.
---
And that's just simple forum/ingame chat moderation. I can't imagine them putting in the man hours required for traditional bot/gold seller methods.
---
He's got like 4 buffs and 4-8 debuffs, that's not all that different from vanilla pvp
---
This is also the last straw that is keeping me from
---
playing.
---
While I don't like the newer renditions of the game in general, I would probably play anyway if I could still use the old models and animations.
---
I was actually looking forward to Legion but in the pre-patch they removed these as options and I quit that day. I returned a couple times but the models just don't do it for me stylistically.
---
The old models are so iconic, I feel like I've been robbed of an important aspect of the game.
---
Yeah, this 100%. If I want to have the optimal raid spec, I'll never go survival. If I'm survival, it is because I'm pvp specced and don't have 100g to respec twice
---
I'm 9-5 in government, I only need to give like a week's notice for a week of leave.
---
Keep in mind that that's only a 2v2 situation.
---
I'm interested as well, and I have a few close friends who might be on top of that. I get home from work usually between 6 and 7pm PST, which seems to be well after most guilds are looking at starting raid nights.
---
The debuff limit was increased from 8 to 16, which will be the limit on classic launch. Shadow priests aren’t brought because they take up 3 debuff slots and have mana issues resulting in lower dps. Okay no, you can bring one to buff locks :).
---
What the fuck are you saying lol. Vael the guild killer? Nicknamed by who? You a couple hours ago? You fake vanilla vets always preach this distant amazing shit you've allegedly indulged in over a decade ago, but based off the comments and questions I see on this subreddit I'm confident that less than a fifth of users were actually playing wow before 2006 (even if you did you probably don't remember anything so cut the crap). 
---
Vael is literally one of the easiest bosses in BWL. Run away if you need to so you don't blow up group and just DPS? Chromagg admittedly is somewhat hard but still, even Chromagg and Nef are bosses that people farm weekly without difficulty. 
---
Your "server" had less than 10 guilds capable of killing him because most people were trash players back then. All these vanilla screenshots I see with horrible UI's and ZERO binds tells you why so few achieved anything memorable in vanilla. And then you say that private servers downplay the "difficulty" you were faced with. Downvote my posts all you want, but I really think you're talking out of your ass.
---
That seems... unlikely.  It’s definitely possible.  Most likely they could have done so but it was too much of a hassle and they were super stoked about the new ones and in their board meeting were like “everyone will love them!” Etc.
---
I'm a hunter and lost zin'rok to a ret pally. Another hunter was fucking furious that I lost it, even though I was perfectly cool with it. 
---
And the dude was so fucking pumped to get it, too. I was silently bitter that I lost it, but then I saw how gd happy the guy was. Apparently he wanted one for years.
---
I don't know about its effect on Hearthstone at all and I also greatly doubt it's affected, but I do vaguely recall a patch note saying this would no longer affect assaulting flags.  I can't remember if that was during Classic or TBC, though.
---
not to mention people buying gold is rarer than tokens that blizzard supplies.
---
I mean the toggle literally caused in game issues with models, randomly switching and stuff like that. They probably could have fixed it but I would assume in their eyes it would be a waste of development time for a niche choice.
---
lmao soz not gonna waste my time on a troll that rebutts a request for evidence with another request for evidence.
---
Haha sure!  I am glad they are enjoyable because they are definitely good memories to me!
---
One thing I will say is that I was blown away with how much integrity and how dedicated the company was to bring the players a game they could fall in love with.  They really instill it the moment you start training.  It's a very fun, cool place to work, but they take the game real serious.  They let you know early on, no funny business on any level.  When GMs played the game, they played exactly as any other player, personal account and GM client never mixed.  For the most part it was real frowned upon to even answer a ticket from a realm you played on.  One girl in my training class ended up getting fired for getting in a spat with someone on her server and she retaliated by deleting their stuff, they deleted her employment.
---
For the most part the player base is really honest, but it was always hilarious to run into people trying to defraud a GM.  Every once in awhile we would get a ticket like, "yeah my thunderfury just vanished!  can you restore it?"  like we weren't gonna be able to verify that A) No, you didn't have it, and B) I can clearly see you saying in chat "watch I'm gonna get those dumb GMs to just give a thunderfury"
---
I've heard July 16th based on something to do with the BFA patch-cycle. That's just speculation, though. It is a Tuesday and its right in the exact middle of the summer. Seems like a good time for it to drop. 
---
If its not then, I'd assume its going to be August and be more in line with their past WoW releases (Legion was September 1st and BFA was mid-August)
---
Over 469,000 honorable kills. DAMN. I wonder what the record is?
---
&gt;2000+ images
---
Mate, I hope you're super knowledgeable on this 15 year old game or you're going to die
---
TB died???
---
Maybe thats the plan ;) /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
For me it's not so much the models as much as the animations, imo they ruined almost every animation they changed.
---
2-3 might be true but one run takes you like 5-6 mins. So you're doing 5 runs 30 min - then wait 30 minutes for the reset and then repeat
---
Yup. Now us kiddies that have grown up and have deep pockets are going to buy our way through he game.
---
Fuck that. I have the money to go nuts buying gold, but please don’t make that an option. Struggling for gold was one of the greatest things about WoW. It created a realistic economy.
---
I had a paladin dwarf with this breastplate and red boots and red gloves and I had a pet bird that followed me around. I looked like a short, fat, giant chicken. I loved it.

Based on the journey described in this comment from early 2006. How much reputation do you think that same human priest would have on a private server following the same exact route?  
---
This is about the only good evidence you'll find. There are some sporadic listings for rep on the original thottbot, but most only have records showing after the launch of TBC.
---
Tell me your name and server. I’ll create some trial accounts and follow you around selling gold.
---
I was about to comment this haha, it's insane.
---
I would've assumed there'd be a FoS for the old-school Grand Marshall title.
---
omfg I totally forgot about that.  Nothing was more hilarious then watching one of those pop off
---
Thank you! I have Photoshop and will find good uses for them like talent sheets, spells etc. for my characters.
---
&gt; I hope tokens aren’t in as gold is so important in Classic. However, if they are in; as a full time working husband I’ll be shamelessly buying them up. Which is kind of sad as I still remember the moment 15 years ago when I’d finally scraped together enough gold for my epic mount.
---
This is what terrifies me. Blizzard is going to sit down one day and be like, “holy shit we’re bringing in X mil a month from Classic WoW right now. How can we further maximize our profits.” And all of us grown up kiddos making six figures are going to be buying those suckers to keep up with the no lifers.
---
I think it’ll happen eventually, just hopefully not until 3-4 years down the road.
---
Kidney Shot, I love the sound and 6 second stun is always fun too.
---
You literally just confirmed everything I said, thank you.

Enjoy not being stuck in ZG

His Holiness Ion the Mathbringer lurked the EJ forums for six days without sleep, and on the seventh he brought us Math. Thereafter the people rejoiced, for Math led to the Great Hotfix and Dark Edges of Insanity were had by all.

I’m always going to say Orc even if hardiness wasn’t a thing. They just look so damn sexy in gear!

You still give up way to much stats for an inconsistent proc. Maybe if the procrate is really high but I think it should be around 1 ppm

I never played a pally in classic (was a main tank warrior), but played a pally in TBC and it was a blast.
---
I wanted to be a melee paladin but slowly fell in love with how OP it was at healing. Good Paladins are unstoppable in PVP and excellent in PVE.
---
Concerning Feral: I have played a Feral Druid for like 2 years in Classic content and they are viable throughout the whole content tbh.
---
Overall:
---
-
---
You can adapt every role to support your raid BUT you wont be as "good" as other Classes - the drawback of your versatility
---
Compared to a Warrior Tank: yes they're less mana efficent to heal and do not have certain mechanics (fear imunity). No Crit/Crushimunity
---
+
---
You're super versatile - you can easily DPS if needed or even Heal/Decurse
---
They do more TPS than Warrior Tanks (at least till late vanilla or when healers are geared)
---
They don't get spiked as hard as Warriors - Warriors can be oneshot sometimes (Lashlayer) where Ferals aren't.
---
They're easier too gear which makes overall progression for you raid easier as well (less competition for all plate)
---
5 man Dungeon: They're amazing since they do way more dmg than any tank at that state of the game (you'll mostly be quite close to the other DPS)
---
MC: They're good for Offtanking where needed or even tanking Bosses - they are the best Fire Res Tanks early on since Mats for Plate Fire res gear is super limited.
---
BWL: Amazing to bring for Offtanking (Razorgore/Wingbuffet of the 3 Dragons) needs or where TPS (Vael) is needed
---
AQ: Amazing since you need tons of Tanks for Trash but mostly only a few for Bosses. You'll get most your feral gear here.
---
Naxx: Still good&amp;viable but might fall off as soon Tanks get t3 / t2.5 (TPS) and yet still you bring the versatility to the raid which any other class wont

Part of it, as well, is wanting to sort of test my capability of whether or not I can theorycraft (on a lower level, not necessarily getting into the deep math work) a build for myself. I know Classic is, in a way, "solved" as to BiS gear and talent placement, but I'm going into this as a fresh start of sorts, put myself through what players had to do when the game first released and there weren't *any* resources to look at. I'm not saying I won't ever end up following a build, at least as far as raiding goes, if I even decide to do that. This goes for any class I decide to play, not just the warrior lol.
---
Its a set i'm still trying to farm on my pally I made back in legion, I think i'm only missing 1-2 more pieces.
---
Exactly. Also, if a token is implemented, WAY more people would do it versus when its all shady and officially discouraged. Makes us honest.
---
Put your money where your mouth is and say something falsifiable by stating *how far* *off* the private servers are. If you can't do that it just means you don't know either values and only know when to spot someone else who doesn't know, but the people who made PS would technically be the best source besides blizzard themselves as they have had to do the most homework when building their PS, no?
---
We know you don't hit exalted after 4 quests, and it isn't 700 quests either. We know it falls within a given range +/-.
---
Be aware it says *next* spell, so the healing spell would consume the buff.
---
Probably the best way is to do the run to menethil straight away, this might get you level 4 with exploration experience. Once you get the menethil flight path fly and train in IF for blessing of might and judgement. After that you can hold off on training until level 10 when you get rank 2 seal of righteousness.
---
Whether it's worth doing this instead of runecloth turn ins at 60 I don't know
---
I used that area for a bunch of emotes. I never used macros.
---
I typed really slowly on keyboard back then, so reacting with these quick emotes in the right moments was a nice roleplay touch.
---
Thanks for that chuckle dude. We killed C‘thun with cookie cutter specs like ferals shadows and retpallys. Nothing is impossible.
---
The wow classic demo used the old models but in the new engine.
---
Actually the reason it's so suboptimal to run more than one druid is because only one regrowth and rejuv works on a target, meaning the higher geared druid is the only one that can use their hots freely since "A more powerful spell is already active" meaning the other druid gets to spam the slow heal and have terrible HPS. We definitely ran two druids and a feral druid was one of our situational OTs but the second druid did not have a great time.
---
Can classic save blizzard? Yes.
---
Can Classic save Activision? No they will never change.
---
The mace is level 58 :p
---
I got some at like 60$ then more and more as it dropped. I'm just recently back to even in it. It will rebound for sure. Not even classic related though. It's dropped way below it's actual value.
---
Hah! You know what? I absolutely hate this idea, but I'm going to upvote you just for voicing an ACTUAL unpopular opinion when you title your post "unpopular opinion". Plus, it's worthy of discussion so at least you can hear why we disagree with it. 
---
Personally, the reason I'm against it is it promotes even more min/maxing. I recognize you might disagree, and fair enough, but honestly, I'll take bots that we can report and then ban, over even MORE min/maxers who I can't even blame because there's so much incentive for it.
---
July 16th is the start of my vacation
---
Wow classic releases July 16th. Calling it!
---
This isn't categorically true, a looot of hunters are just alts used for farming DMN so not a ton of people main hunters on p-servers. We had a few months where we had a lot of trouble finding hunters and we had to borrow alts from random guilds or make some players use their hunter alts to keep our tranq rotations stable.
---
Or you need to be a better friend
---
I work a night IT job. At least 6 of my 8 hours of my work night is me doing whatever I feel like is entertaining while glancing at monitoring software every 30 mins. Some of my coworkers even take 30 min naps.
---
That is unless things break. When things break I have to actually do things.
---
Spriest healing is legit Soo fun
---
I think maybe... You're probably putting too much thought into it lol.
---
Are you sure it will be in in Classic's 1.12. I know that LHC/ND server has it, but afaik it got removed when they streamlined it to be less PvEy.
---
I feel you. I played mage in vanilla and will do so again. I'll be going Forsaken because I like the starting areas and lore. Their casting animations are also probably the best for casters (especially female). Forsaken just seem more.. magey than trolls.
---
So, what you are saying is... Roll a frost mage and never worry about flag runners again. :V
---
I love the horde mail rank gear so much.
---
I would say just redo the first one. It's way more fun starting mission 2 when you're all pimped out with killmaim. Plus if you don't do the first one you won't have Chen, and that's way less fun. 
---
I recommend start with first one, get to level 4ish and then unlock Chen (he's roughly due north of Org, just east of the Murlocs near the top. Do the phoenixes last with tons of saves because getting past those owlbears can be a beeeatchat low levels). If you leave Chen until way later he feels very underpowered.  
---
Alternatively, there are cheat codes to just skip the mission. But honestly? It won't be as fun. Plus, if you're really feeling it you can just farm gold and buy tomes of strength (agi for rokhan) and pimp your dudes out and it's awesome. Part two is just as good as part one (though it starts a tiny bit lame with some blademaster you don't care about, but then it completely makes up for that by some of the characters you run into after ;), and part three puts it all together and has some major lore implications (...that unfortunately don't get explored until BFA, which sucks. But it's still really neat to see).   
---
Oh! And in act two at one point there's ONE goblin merchant that sells vampiric mask. BUY IT!!!! It makes things more fun when you can just beast-mode through things with it.
---
Man up and play a gnome mage
---
I'm worried that they'll screw it up... But the classic games team hasn't let us down so far at least, so I remain optimistic.
---
It also destroys wPvP.
---
Don't need to farm in the world anymore? People with deep pockets are juston their asses all week, get geared to the teeh by buying craftable gear or consumables and never venture out unless if they feel like.
---
In a away tokens instance a part of the playerbase away from the game.
---
PPM in an MMO refers to Proc-Per-Minute. The % will vary depending on the speed of the weapon. Meaning 1PPM proc rate on a weapon of 2.4speed yields the following:
---
2.4/60=0.04 = 4%
---
The forsaken is great because the main lore is about finding your place in a world where the undead, including yourself, are hunted down for the sole fact of existing.
---
For your troll problem, while they are more primitive in culture, they aren't that dumb, and they have connections to loa (spirits of immense power) that grant them access to elemental and arcane abilities.
---
It's a matter of personal preference which one you chose, and there isn't really anything to convince one way or the other as the lore for both are really interesting imo. -except minmaxing for pve/pvp-
---
The story is great, especially if you like WoW. The gameplay can be a bit tedious at times in RoC, but gets AMAZING in TFT. 
---
Oh! And to enhance your enjoyment, I really recommend checking out this youtube series:   
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jwb73Wx8og](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jwb73Wx8og)
---
Story wise I agree, I prefer SC and BW, but gameplay wise WC3 TFT takes the cake.
---
Soundtrack.  You could customize the music for every zone, subzone, events, bgs, etc.  It was magical in case you grew old of the default music.
---
I know this is really late into the game, but let's say in a couple of years, everyone has really good gear. Will healers get stronger or weaker in PvP? I'm thinking about the crazy damage all the DPS will pump out, elemental shaman bursts etc. Will healing be as impactful as in the beginning of Classic?
---
Never underestimate the ~~furbolgs~~ bears, man.
---
Rokhan was the real hero of that campaign. Change my mind. :P
---
Do you think delays are planned? What the actual fuck are you going on about.
---
Rage generation will be smoother (but not necessarily better) with a fast OH. Flurry wont really be affected because your OH in any meaningfull way. Stats/weapon skill (from stats- or from racial) is the most important factor when considering an OH.
---
Yes they were.
---
&gt; but Summer doesn't end until September 23rd
---
...what? That's not how the calendar works.
---
Unsure of accuracy but IIRC the tuning urban legend during vanilla was that these weapons (thrash, flurry axe, ironfoe etc) ran on a 5% chance with an internal cooldown.
---
Why is this sad? It is one of the reasons vanilla is great and interesting in a gearing perspective. There are no clearly defined cut-offs between raid tiers in vanilla which encourage you to raid older content aswell.
---
I hate the new models. Especially Tauren, undead and human. And orc.
---
A bear tank is plenty good enough to handle any 5 man content.
---
It has high burst potential - Lightning Bolt (travels) - Chain Lightning (Hits immediate) - Shock (Hits immediate) = 3 spells hitting within 1 Second timeframe
---
OH yes. MH, well sort-of but not really. It is not a huge factor. I will admit to that. Several abilities scarle with high top damage on your MH.
---
That being said, I'm currently raiding on a private server as fury and I'm using TF+Hungering cold combo. My WW attacks are a bit gimped due to the low top-end damage of TF but it is compensated by the stupidly powerful proc.
---
As an Australian, I had to google what the hell people are talking about, because I've never heard of a season ending on any date other than the end of a calendar month. I presume that's what OP was asking.
---
no its just an internet meme because he was bad at pvp when he played wow.
---
I'm sure that wont be a strain on any newly formed friendships.
---
*Hey, help me farm this item with a ~1% droprate that takes 30-60min each run*
---
With the right positioning and strat time lapse actually gives you more DPS time on target lol, we just didn't know how to tank him back then.

Correction: It does not duplicate. It can *proc of off* any attack (auto hit or special) but the proc it yields will be an autohit.
---
This duplication meme is just heresay (of Ironfoe I might add, not thrashblade) that was posted by *some dude* in a wowhead comment in TBC.
---
The proc works like HoJ or WF totem.
---
What purpose would the healing serve though? PvP self healing? Open world grinding?
---
Thats just for the tank. Only thing i think is different in private servers is the lava splash damage in ragnaros. It used to do significant damage, now there isnt any ? But nothing a FR potion wouldnt take care of for most ppl.
---
And if people one phase it ~always, it cuts down the damage by a LOT.
---
If you have the time, you could play the Warcraft III human/undead campaigns again, where the Forsaken are basically created. I think they have the richest and most interesting lore from all the horde races. And keep in mind that Sylvanas was way different back then before Blizzard abused her to have a story for Legion/BfA.
---
I recently played an undead from 1 to 11 and while it gets a little bit old with "kill Scarlet  Crusade here, kill Scarlet Crusade there", it's really immersive and I like the fact that, after character creation, you basically just woke up from your grave and they're like "oh nice, you made it."
---
But then again, Trolls have the best casting animation in the game by a long shot.
---
All four of the listed will not work in druid-forms.
---
Curious to this as well
---
i feel like we wont be able to keep up as well
---
Thats the spirit, you need that grinding ironfoe. Its always 50:50. It either drops or it doesnt.
---
Play a hybrid spec if you're going to solo queue. 30 Ret / 21 Holy for Paladin. Or 31 Ret / 20 Holy so you can pick up Repentance - this is probably better if you never raid. 
---
The reason? A lot of other players SUCK. You don't want to be tethered to a bad group, unable to make an impact because all you can do is heal a bunch of bads. If you play a hybrid spec, then you can throw on your Ret gear and actually make an impact when you recognize that your group isn't performing.
---
For Paladin specifically: your healing set in dungeons and raids will probably include a lot of cloth. Make sure to get a second set that's all plate for battlegrounds. You want that extra armor in PvP.
---
I see you are a person of excellent taste.
---
if it doesn't pan out you already have a DMN farming alt
---
Arcane is actually the spec for mage raiding during the spam frostbolt stage of progression
---
Add option to list with multiple guilds on the same realm.
---
Sorry, I phrased that badly. If he's heavy into PvP it's worth just buying the epic mount, PvE farming as a Warlock is what makes the solid gold.
---
I don’t understand your question...prot warrior is closest to prot warrior in retail....it’s a tank who has high defence, little mobility, low dps. Can you explain what you mean?
---
Sir, BT came before Sunwell, did you get that backwards?
---
Just curious. As someone who played only a couple months before tbc came out and only got to like 25-30, how long does it take to get to 60. Say I play 5-6 hours a night. 
---
I've played every xpac since then so I'm not an idiot anymore when it comes to levelling.
---
It’s safe to say this dude has some kind of mental disability. He can’t even spell “guaranteed” properly lol
---
What server is that?
---
Yeah i have no idea why i said Horde because Brod was with you guys till he ninja'd the Cloak from the rare spawn from Strat off the Gargoyle ( well that was the story he told me ) And yeah Faldhake was wicked still remember the day he made his Hammer in IF on the bridge so many people there kneeling around him. 
---
But yeah i agree with you it was a great time running into shit blind with the sense of adventure or very minimal/limited PTR time to test shit.
---
Do you remember Flipno? Little gnome warlock.
---
I'm sorry, but everything you said about leveling is wrong. Mages are infinitely faster than Warriors at leveling, especially when you take into account they can AOE grind better than any other class. Doing dungeons while leveling is almost always a waste of time as well (at least in terms of maximizing XP/HR).
---
&gt;Would a full destruction spec 5/5/41 be the hardest nuking pvp spec in the game? 
---
No. For starters NFC warlocks have better burst than 5/5/41. You can see an example of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3iHXZXx7g0&amp;bpctr=1555394792
---
Secondly, a pom-pyro or full-fire mage would still nuke harder.
---

Im sure i used or atleast tested that ui at one point. Not so healer friendly, but jeesus i have all my screenshots from vanilla and my ui was a shitshow, so what do i know.
---
Yeah, he passed last May.

Lvl 45 talent : Spirit Wolf causes you to gain 5% increased movement speed / damage reduction every second while transformed into Ghost Wolf Icon Ghost Wolf, stacking up to 20% of each.
---
Pvp talent: Spectral Recovery 
---
While in Ghost Wolf, you heal 3% health every 2 sec.
---
Azerite Trait(can have up to 3 which stack): Pack Spirit While Ghost Wolf is active, heal for 2755 every 1 sec.

The simplest synopsis of warrior is; 
---
Angry man smash become angrier.
---
Cringe...
---
Zim got the bug!
---
Well pally cant be a effective dpser, so what does that leave you with ? :)
---
the one change I want in vanilla is for decay to never bring you below an earned rank. If not for every rank, at least rank 14 so people get to keep the title
---
Troll culture isn't necessarily more primitive as dwarves and humans are still tribal as fuck. Dark iron, wildhammer, the kingdoms of man. Living in a fancier house doesn't make you more advanced. I mean trolls built most of the world before the nightelves ruined it.
---
Druid. Having any sort of impact as a Druid requires situational awareness, proper positioning, and knowing how to fill multiple roles depending on the situation. 95% of Druids are doomed before they even start because they think "I'm Feral" or "I'm Resto" instead of "I'm a Druid".
---
Hunter is a notable 2nd choice. Hunters are a lot like Druids - they win with defense, not offense. Kite, drain, CC, then kill. The difference is that Hunters don't heal or tank/carry flags. They only have to deal damage and CC. They naturally have less to learn before they can make an impact.
---
Being a GM during vanilla, having stories and can explain how things worked. That's AMA worthy without a doubt! You'd please a lot of people here.
---
This is the first time I've heard any of this. Never heard of pallies being god mode in pvp,ever.
---
Nice try, vanilla poser!
---
Ahh I really don't want wow tokens for various reasons, but it really seems like a necessary evil for me. People don't even know that all the gold sellers on p servers aren't even Chinese they are Eastern European that use VPNs and Mac address manipluation with VMs. It's really hard to ban them unless they are trading 5k gold for no reason. Blizzard is leaning way more towards automation with less staff which even leaves a bigger gap in security imo
---
+1
---
I don't think you realize buying gold is actual p2w in Classic.
---
It does though : p
---
Yeah, i have them on my hunter still
---
Why wouldn’t I run 8 shamans if I can?
---
Or nova, ice block, ice barrier... basically everything that made it overpower
---
How many people have actually found long lost friends?
---
Save? They don't need to be saved. They just need to show their current games they're working on and people will hype and forget the "Don't you have phones?"-con.
---
I guess that’s all perspective, my group of friends that have been playing wow together for 15 years would not complain one bit about farming for each other. We’ve done it before, we will do it again.
---
Which is exactly why I have no disillusions about expecting to be a main tank for a guild or anything of the sort with that character.
---
It will help but it won’t save anything on its own. The stock drop is a result of multiple factors, including missed earnings (COD battle royals flopped).
---
Such an amazing improvement. Great work guys!
---
The sellpoint for Classic WoW is to bring back the classic experience.
---
I would place the lvl obtained as first column much less straining on the eyes that way.
---
Depends on your class, motivation, time management skills. The fastest time to level was my hunter, just over 6 days played. I grinded **only** Beast mobs (they give you the most gold on average from grey items) from level 30-60 and when i hit 60 I immediately had enough gold to purchase my epic mount. Warlock was around 7.5 days played, when i hit 60 i also had enough epic mount gold. Druid was around 7 days as well, same with Rogue. I did not have epic mount gold as soon as i hit 60 with them, but i was about 3/5 of the way there. You get the picture. I don't think i've ever taken more than 8+ days played on any of my 60's besides my Paladin (for obvious reasons) because when I play i don't like to waste time, if a quest is taking too long i move on, if the quest area is packed i find a new one. I Rarely step foot in STV as it is a HUGE time sink PVP is fun but it increases your playtime exponentially, so i choose Desolace instead. I also do not use levelling guides because after playing the game for so long you already know questing zone priority, where to go, where to stay away from, what quests are worth it, and its just not as fun. I'm sure my play times could be faster, but having an epic mount waiting for you as soon as you ding 60 is an incredible feeling and makes it so you can start rolling in even more dough. Most of my characters have Herb/Mining because in my opinion, its the absolute best way to make gold on the way to 60, and a consistent stream of gold once you start farming Winterspring/Plaguelands at 60. I hope this helps.

The company is fine.
---
I’m a massive shareholder, as it’s my largest position in my Roth IRA.
---
Initially bought in 2008 and bought more in 2019
---
Thanks for the feedback! Sure I'll give that a try and see what people think.
---
I used to love old models before, but the new ones are way better, no more flying shoulders for orcs, hair going thru helmets etc.
---
I dunno about rogues. I played one during all of vanilla and i was quite good at it (very high win% in duels, even against the better PVPers).
---
But I was 15-16 y old and frankly quite stupid. Today, I'd win against my self back then pretty much every duel if I lvled a rogue. Because they're that easy to learn and master. And I'm much better at game snow.
---
Been so torn between mage and druid lately but planned to main a druid. Mage on first spin.  Fuuck
---
The trolls are currently in a time similar to the medieval times of real life humankind.
---
The troll empire (Rome) was destroyed, but they still have knowledge in parts and they are by no means dumb.
---
Even nightelves are descendants of trolls and trolls had the biggest empire known to Azeroth united under one banner before it was shattered.
---
Trolls would take a dump on all other races and probably enslave them would their empire still hold up.
---
Also you still have trolls that wield magic nowadays. Look at Jin'do. He's not using fire, frost or arcane, but he's more like the Diablo2 necromancer. However it's still very advanced magic that certainly does not come from the elements seeing how he summons the undead to do his bidding.
---
He died from cancer around a year ago. Fuck off.
---
Sorry, I worded that wrong. What I was trying to say is that you can find a group faster for doing those dungeon quests. I agree that questing is way faster than trying to run only dungeons. 
---
You probably are right that mages are faster at aoe grinding. In my experience the warrior’s version was more fun and that is what made it feel faster even if it technically isn’t.
---
I think people really underestimate how much of a grind OSRS is... a /played of over 100 days isn’t uncommon for people no even halfway to max. Level 60 is what, like 6-10 days /played for an average player?
---
I will level with my best friend who rolls a priest and he will help me farm it. To which I am grateful. I don’t consider him any less of a friend if he said he wouldn’t farm it, because that would be hugely entitled of me and undeserving.
---
Saying “you need better friends” because they won’t help you grind 0.5% drop is such a shitty comment.
---
Im sure there was some kind of issue but to declare it an unsolvable game breaking issue seems like an excuse
---
Yeah - you can change your experience by *paying* to save time. Which feels anti-Classic (to me, at least).
---
Twinks in BGs - gear funneling done via token.
---
Wars/Pals with Nightblade+Crusader, bought via token.
---
Accomplishments would feel different. Even something basic like farming felcloth for mooncloth would feel different if you could just buy a token and flip things.
---
I agree with the AQ war effort, I was discussing of the same topic with my little brother. It makes sense.
---
For pvp, overall it’s not required (appart dishonorable kills that really stopped raiding a city)
---
For the addons, I think it was part of the charm of the game to be able to customize everything
---
This is a great question, and I hear you completely. 
---
I'd like to question your assumptions here however.
---
I think you're correct that the troll - mage lore is flimsy at best. You nailed it, throughout Warcraft's history they've been closer to hunters (axe throwers/spear throwers/berserkers/bat riders) or shamans (troll witch doctor/shadow hunters). 
---
But in Vanilla WoW, I really need to push back on the idea that undead are objectively evil. 
---
First, let's consider what we mean by objectively evil. The closest thing to that in WC3 is Sargeras, and after that is the Dreadlords, and then after that is Arthas. Somewhere after that are characters like Illidan, Kael'Thas, and Sylvanis. 
---
I'm not being pedantic here either: Sylvanis breaks free from the scourge, and actively fights against them. That's not evil. She cares deeply for her people. That can cause her to commit evil acts, but it also means that she's not wholly self-serving, so again: not evil.   
---
In fact, let's think about who the Forsaken are: They're the humans of Lordaeron brought back into this world. Who were the humans of Lordaeron? For the most part they were racist, slave-owning, self-serving, arrogant assholes. At least their leadership was. Think about it, even from the Second War (where we first meet the humans of Lordaeron) we have Lord Peregrin (I forget the last name), of Alterac, a traitor responsible for uncountable numbers of needless deaths.  Daelin Proudmoor, who's got a sweet navy sure... But he was such a damn warmonger he sent his people into battle against warriors who had stood shoulder to shoulder with his daughter to save the entire world. Teranas Menethil was too busy bickering with aristocrats to notice that his people were DYING, and that his own son was slowly becoming corrupt, even before his soul was stolen by Frostmourne and the Lich King. The arrogant mages of Dalaran could have actually HELPED a bit BEFORE the demon lord Archimond was right on their doorstep. There's a reason the only morally good mages of Dalaran (Khadgar, Jaina, and Kael'Thas) want as little to do with it as possible. Don't even get me started on Garithos, that monster who wished nothing more than the genocide of all non-humans. 
---
Now the people of Lordaeron have a chance to experience life under a ruler who, in Vanilla and TBC, is just, fair, and loyal. (Possibly even in WoTLK as well, depending on your interpretation of what went down at the Wrathgate). They are as free-willed as any other playable race in WoW (see:  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Forsaken#Free\_will](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Forsaken#Free_will) ). Like the Orcs in the Third War, theirs is a story of redemption. You're not a golden knight in shining armor. But you're not evil either, unless you want to be.   
---
Of course, are the rest of the Horde going to trust you right off the bat? Hell no. You and your Banshee Queen need to earn our trust. Your starting reputation is neutral, and that's because we don't really know if we can trust you yet. Yet, if you are true of heart you can gain our trust, and become a noble warrior of the horde.  
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
---
Now, with all of that said, if you're still unconvinced, then roll Troll and just make up the head cannon. Since you're right, they are badass and have a rich history within the World of Warcraft... Just, not as mages, until the brave troll Riggable began to learn the arcane ways...
---
Funny. Tauren is the only one I like. Finally have actual hair and a nice face. They do walk funnier now tho
---
I had them in vanilla and the proc wasn't worth it. I used them as much as I could but during any serious raiding I wouldn't use them. I did use the hell out of them in every other situation I could though :D.
---
I agree that Priests are better as healers in organized groups (especially on Horde), but dispels don't completely remove a Shadow Priest from the game. Mana Burn is still a thing. They can even talent for the reduced cast time in a more-or-less cookie cutter build.
---
OP: Shadow Priests have zero issues with gear. They wear cloth and cloth caster gear is everywhere. You can raid as a Shadow Priest, but even if you do heal, a lot of early items with damage and healing are actually great for healers. Those are items you could pick up as a healer. Plus there's Anathema/Benediction. I think Shadow Priest is the easiest hybrid to gear up. I wouldn't worry if I were you.
---
That's the first video he ever uploaded to his channel.
---
I am playing online games longer than WoW is around. I know how toxic people can get. And exactly because I have seen many toxic people I dont believe they are going full blown out on people they have no deal with.
---
Was wondering where there is no Johny Rico reference in Silithus?
---
Bear form druid, I guess.
---
Druids use claw attacks, not weapon attacks. They can not proc fiery weapon, crusader or similar on-hit effects in forms.
---
The only enchants they are able to use are stat enchants such as +15 or +25 agility.
---
Yes it did help, ty. I plan on lvling warlock. My other options are mage or Hunter depending on what my one or 2 buddies play. I think I might play a vanilla private server and get the initial grind down from like 1-30 or so. Do you have any recomendations?
---
I agree that Warriors are a lot more fun than Mages. Mages bore the shit out of me.
---
Forsaken still have their free will. From a RP point of view, you can imagine your character as a mage who fought Sylvanas when he was alive, got killed by her and revived. Now you hate her for what she's done to you but are still trying to use this second chance to do good in the world. Makes sense to me.
---
It wouldn't be too different from present-day prot paladin if it wasn't for how incredibly central the stance mechanic is.
---
Even a complete noob could figure out arcane is shit
---
Retail wow bricked my MacBook air, alot of people will tell you that it works fine, on paper it looks like it should. I downloaded a CPU temperature monitor and the second I had more than 10 people on the screen the CPU temperature hit 110+.
---
To sum it up, possible possibly, practical never.
---
Instantly looks 10 times better!
---
Please go Troll. TOO MANY FORSAKEN MAGES!!!!
---
Spotted the troll.
---
It depends on faction. Pretty much all of the quest hubs on Kalimdor are night elf except for neutral towns and the occasional alliance hubs such as Theramore Isle. Aside from Orgrimmar, Darnassus rep is probably the easiest faction rep.
---
I'm sure you went ahead and researched it for yourself before you made the statement, anything else would be dishonest.
---
Missed the warlock class thread. My question is: about how many soul shards would I need to farm before the raid starts? One per raider?
---
I don't really get what people mean by unconventional builds. Yes, not every spec is viable for raiding, but the game is bigger than raiding.
---
Elemental is viable in PvP
---
Retribution is viable for solo play and PvP
---
Balance can be played for leveling or PvP, it's just not very good.
---
Shadow is amazing in PvP and many raids bring one Shadow Priest per raid
---
IIRC Hunters tend to spec into Survival at late tier raiding.
---
Most specs are viable, it's just not all are viable in PvP
---
Hi! EU player here intending to roll Orc rogue. I focus mostly on combat PvE and have played rogue at 60 before through MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20 (but not Naxx or AQ40). PM me any other questions you have :)
---
depending on class and what you are doing n shit 7-12 days ingame playtime is normal for first timers
---
Funny. I'm just finding this out now and I'm pretty happy about that.
---
The ones I used was like..
---
KTM
---
SWStats
---
Xpearl
---
And some addon that showed stun durations and such.
---
This is the intro for my newest video in the Dungeon Dives series.
---
You can check it out here! :)

---
line 70 and 79 are talented spells also. Good work on this!
---
What the fuck did you just say lil punk ?
---
Just look for video with the character sheet open at the beginning, was pretty common when a person wanted to show their dps what gear they were using. For example one of the first video i found when i searched vanilla dps : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU6WQk9eLJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU6WQk9eLJI)  he show to us his character sheet.
---
A lot of old timers fall in love with one particular game and stick to that one game.
---
For instance the man known only as [74 year old grandpa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPiBrIXCiQE) who played Asheron's Call from 1999 when he was 56 years old until its shutdown two years ago when he was 74. He played it for 18 years.
---
World of Warcraft is turning 15 this November by the way.
---
Last I heard it's some Chinese guy with an insane HK count in the millions.
---
Yes and here fall begins on the 1st of september, your spring starts on the same date no?
---
You learn the encounter without using any consumables and when you are ready you use the consumes to try to kill it. That's what a lot of guild did.
---
Whenever I think of groupquesting in vanilla my mind goes to Jintha‘Alor :)
---
Blink.
---
I would say probably elemental shaman
---
Yeah, but I think he was talking about people saying Summer ends on September 23 which makes no sense to us, I'd never heard of a season ending on anything other than the end of a month until this thread
---
I am not trying to take away anything from Forsaken, but I would argue that most races have a much richer lore. Not talking about interesting, thats definitely highly subjective, but all other races have been around for that much longer. And apart from maybe Gnomes and Tauren all of them did quite a lot in that time.
---
Hey there, looks like you're referring to Consecration rank 3 and Seal of Command rank 3. Rank 1 of each of these spells are indeed learned through talents, and I have a note in there for those spells at rank 1. However, once the talents have been selected, subsequent ranks of those spells are trained at the class trainer I believe. This could be wrong, I'm just going off memory and the Master Guide. Let me know if I'm mistaken here. Cheers!
---
&gt; Even nightelves are descendants of trolls and trolls had the biggest empire known to Azeroth united under one banner before it was shattered.
---
The nigt elves under Azshara dwarfed that empire by quite a margin tho
---
If you're on the fence go troll. Troll is objectively BiS for mage pretty much the entire game due the faster casts from Berserking, but getting your mages to roll troll isn't easy at all because they look so bad.
---
With a equal skill, a troll mage will outperform an undead one.
---
And as far as lore goes I see what you're saying, it doesn't feel natural, but as trolls are the oldest race on Azeroth, they were around for the well of eternity and thus were influenced by it. Night elves and Tauren have a stigma against using arcane magics as they don't want to attract the burning legions attention back to azeroth and they have great civilizations policing these rules for thousands of years. Trolls do have great empires but don't carry the same superstitions, and the Darkspear are a small and broken people, they have no restrictions. Think of yourself as a wielder of titan magic secretly passed down from the war of the ancients by your bloodline.
---
I would be more than happy to!  I do think I should double check with the mods, but  I will send a message and if I get the ok I will post one!
---
He id it on a PServer most likely.
---
Best part of this comment is they have no idea who Jtm is.
---
I tanked a bunch of those Strat runs of my holy specced paladin. It was fairly smooth going. In hindsight it was very easy compared to the medal runs of today but at the time it felt hard and it was nice being able to provide a service for guildies.
---
Looks good
---
&gt;Pretty sure Blizzard is going to continue their trend of "fixing things" that aren't broken, even in Classic.
---
Nope, we are getting as close to vanilla as possible. They have flat out stated that the vanilla database they had with all the mobs stats and items is their source that they will not touch. Therefore if an item existed with the same stats in vanilla then classic will have the same stats.
---
No that sounds weird. I've always considered september to be autumn since we have a week of good temperatures at best at the beginning of that month but further down south in like Spain and Greece it's probably hot as balls all through september.
---
Dunno how common this once but lots of people on our server believed that if you could DPS down Mr Smite in Deadmines before he was able to stomp, he dropped an epic. I personally continued to believe that far far later than I should have
---
Lmao. 
---
Vanilla hunter is very hard to do well there will be many many noob hunters. 
---
Also, if the majority of players in Classic are pserver or retails the game is doomed. 
---
Classic will imo capture a lot of new players as the hype will be real. Think about a new 12yr old falling in love with wow like most of us did all those years ago. Kind of jelly of that new experience haha
---
I won't, trust me. Already talked with my employer and we agreed that I can take a long vacation (\~4-5 weeks) on short notice as soon as our child is born.  
---
so I will have plenty of time. I'm pumped for this!
---
If they wanted that, Blizzard would create a new MMO. Maybe WoW 2. "In the spirit of Classic/Vanilla! Old-school gaming! etc."
---
I've quoted Brack and you can read the whole interview. Here is the "Restoring History" (telling name) panel from Blizzcon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
This project is all about preservation and history. You can play it and create new experiences for yourself. If you are not satisfied with that, Classic might not be for you.
---
Also with that being said ele is a lot closer to being useful in a raid than enhance.
---
It won’t be in Classic like retail. 
---
However, let’s be real here. There’ll be some kind of addon to help grouping I assure you. I’m not saying it’s good or bad I’m saying it’ll happen.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BldVX-FbPos
---
bullshit
---
Classic is a puddle in the Activision-Blizzard ocean. There's not enough monetization routes to make Classic "save" AB.
---
Pro-tip: Don't take stock advise from a gaming forum for a game made.by the company you're considering buying.
---
I think Northdale is the main Vanilla server atm. I know a fresh server opened up recently by the same people who made Elysium. But I haven't touched pservers in about 9 months so I'm not totally on the loop. Try wowservers Reddit for more concrete answers.
---
I had a similar dilemma and I ended up going Troll, no regrets. While their lore for the class isn't as fleshed out as others, Trolls were perhaps the first arcane spellcasters on Azeroth, as the Dark Trolls that were exposed arcane power of the Well of Eternity became the Night Elves.
---
Otherwise, I found Troll mages to fit well in practice - Polymorph has hex-like vibes and the various wards and conjuration spells felt appropriate to me.
---
Ultimately go with what feels right and you can create your own backstory for the character.
---
Try no.rthd.ale (this sub blanks out private server names so I had to spell it weird. Just remove the periods
---
I see Platinum WoW, I upvote. Your stuff is epic man :).
---
It's not so bad. Overpower does less damage overall than other Warrior abilities so it works out in your favor.
---
Dont forget we have to download the game. So add a few years onto that to be accurate
---
Why did they have to draw on that stupid smile?
---
Love the nucleardamagecloud on the chest, peak retri
---
No. If they wanted to create a new game and experience for vanilla they'd do WoW 2.
---
They are bringing back the vanilla experience by doing all these things they almost didn't have to do. Like good phases, spell batching etc.
---
Hopefully there is an option to choose. I prefer the new ones personally.
---
Ya 5 sec regen while in beast forms 👍
---
troll mage is life
---
Agreed. If you’re good you’ll be far more useful regardless of spec
---
Erm, yes? Seems we do agree then? :) That's what I said. They didn't just wanted a "classic experience". They wanted to recreate the *game* as it was. That's why they are bringing back all those things like spell batching, so the game functions as it did.
---
&gt;One of the things my brother-in-law and I used to do was to find odd talents, spec and gear to support it, and then proceed to take out Meta Specs in PvP when they don’t know how to respond to it.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I’ve always said the only broken specs are the ones that you can support via talents, gear, and a solid rotation. If you can get all 3 of those on a “memespec” then you can roll the cookie cutters all day. I’ve only ever run into a few specs that were truly broken.
---
Yes there’s been some deep theory crafting into fire Warlock in Naxx/AQ raids on the Warlock discord. It’s quite interesting and it mixes well with the arcanite dragonling Fire debuff.
---
You d think that, but people are idiots.
---
To have the classic experience you'd need to create the game exactly how it was. And their focus is to recreate the experience.
---
Isn't that a post vanilla totem?
---
Were you the King of Battle? (Battleking?)
---
Yeah I can confirm that kuroma was not a bot , just fuelled by meow mix.
---
Nightfall proccers unite!
---
Socket? In the wow classic subreddit? Get outta here you filthy retail player!
---
*returns in his cave, waiting for classic*
---
Forsaken for pvp, troll for pve, forsaken for both.
---
 
---
Vote forsaken mage 2019
---
It's not bis because it's from a tier 1 raid. I mean, I know vanilla itemization was all over the place but come on, it's still the entry level raid
---
I've compiled a list of guilds recruiting for Classic WoW across various Discords and websites. All guilds should have some contact method via a link to a thread, a persons discord name or a guilds discord server.
---
I'll update this every week with new recruiting guilds but feel free to send me any corrections or new guilds to be added.
---
The only thing that matters for me and friends where we go are Paladin vs Shaman. Paladin makes many things so trivial tbh, however Windfury might be one of the greatest things in the whole game in Classic. So yeah we are pretty sure its gon be Horde.
---
Warrior, rogue, mage, hunter, warlock.  
---
  Million shamans and paladins at the start, a quarter of those left by level 30.    
---
  There's a fair amount of hunters but hunter is the hardest class to play effectively in classic so you won't see many on the upper tiers.  
---
  Rogue is always most popular.  
---
  Warrior and mage will be on the top because of their performance.
---
I can remember we did a 3-man SM run, that was pure awesome and the Warrior-Shaman-Priest Setup was perfect for it, Good weapon, windfury and there you go!
---
Arent the Cloth donation quest getting added later on? Iirc they arent in from the very start
---
Nowhere close, vanilla hunter is the hardest class in vanilla wow.  
---
  There's a lot of quirks, knowledge and roles the class has to fill to reach its potential, on top of doing things no other class has to worry about so much like the tempo for auto shot and what not.
---
Everything will be as it was.

Compare raid mechanics now to raid mechanics in vanilla, I reckon naked specless people might clear some content lmao

---
Beastslayer was a +damage stat, wasnt it? If so it would work.
---
I'm not a min maxer lol
---
Yes, of course, but WC3 is much more recent. Gameplay wise, a more fair comparison would be with SC2, which is at least on par with the former.
---
And here is his last appearance on his channel : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn-AVNTM6xE
---
Its easy to forget stuff because the story became a mess. So many loose ends the series couldnt possibly bring to closure without disappointing
---
Now I remember something similiar!  
---
IFRC He changes weapons in the fight, he dropps always the weapon which he dealt the least amount of damage with. Me and my friend did DM like 3 times, and it was always right! We were 12 and had no idea how look talbes work!
---
My guild at the time, Death Dealers, recruited a dwarf priest named Sygella.  Hideous female dwarf, the guy made her to look as ugly as possible.  This priest ended with Eye of Divinity, a Cauterizing Band, and like five pieces of prophecy.
---
Literally, got prophecy pants AND then transcendence pants from rag.  I couldn’t believe the luck.  We rolled with DKP so this priest started with probably like negative 2 months worth of DKP.  But the guy stuck around and was a great raider.
---
i've always done human areas 1-40, so doing darkshore/ashenvale/stonetalon/... will be a new thing
---
I'm not really as much of a purist as you seem to think I am. I actually agree that unlimited (or at least increased) debuff slots would quite likely be a positive change that could increase the skill ceiling in raids by making more specs/items/spells viable.
---
The point I wanted to make was that there are lots of systems in the game that might look pointless or detrimental at first glance, but in fact make the game more interesting in subtle ways, and because of this, I think that a philosophy of recreating the systems as closely as possible is a good default position.
---
why is there no rogue mug? i would actually consider buying one.
---
I had to farm a piece of my dungeon set from scholo, I just wanted to complete the set.   I must've run scholo a good 30 times, full clear.   Then I grinded out the leather scholo set too, about 70 runs in total for both   
---
Wild estimations.  But felt like a long time.
---
Awesome work!
---
&gt;alchemy and what other profession on your alt?
---
What does recentness have to do with it? We're talking greatest games of RTS history, not "greatest RTS games of the 90s". Besides, WC3 was closer in time to SCBW than it was SC2.
---
&gt;But in Vanilla WoW, I really need to push back on the idea that undead are objectively evil.
---
Forsaken are not inherently evil, but lately Sylvanas has gone off the deep end.
---
 If you read "Before the Storm" (the BfA prequel book), you get a good sense of what most Forsaken are like (and what Sylvanas is like).
---
For me it was the Electromagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator, the cloth headpiece from the last boss in Gnomeregan. I was a level 30 Gnome mage and thought the use ability sounded like the coolest thing ever. I bugged my level 60 mage best friend to run me through 26 times until I got it, will never forget that number.
---
I used it for exactly two levels, because I was like level  35 and quickly replaced it with something from SM. I never got caught up on one single piece of gear again, lesson learned.
---
Doesn’t answer the question though
---
Won’t happen sorry.
---
Okay, but we're talking about Vanilla WoW, not BfA nonsense.
---
Remember Runestrike in early wotlk? Similar concept and totally broken.
---
i do, and the game sucks anyway. Look at the Tauren running animation on retail lol , same with orcs. Yikes.
---
Pretty sure whirlwind is level 36.
---
Yes, this is very much a thing on pserver. Basically, have people summon Unconcious Dig Rat and hit rats t'ill it procs.
---
P.S. The rat can be polymorphed.
---
I believe that would be "half-man up", at best.
---
Having transmog wouldnt change that, as you need to get it before can transmog.
---
But I am in full support of no transmog option.
---
Each armor upgrade in classic was a visual reminder of that hard slog getting those darned reagent for a quest with a 4% drop rate, that lucky rare world drop you scored, that epic dungeon run whose boss finally dropped the piece you ran it all those times for. This is what it's all about fellas
---
My first ever SM run was with a rogue (I was a paladin), we were around 41-42. It was bit buggy where we played, since Herod kept respawning, but it was super fun, rogue was tanking most of the time (he knew his shít), using billions of potion. Sweenie, or Swiny, or something like that, if you read this, I still remember you!
---
Most likely won't be in Classic 1.12
---
They removed herbs/ores and loot from AV in late vanilla, I think we're getting that version
---
as already mentioned 21/0/30 is a good hybrid with pala. I used that back in Vanilla and was able to heal in dungs and raids, but could also go for dps.
---
Haha that dwarf pala and shit t1 armor, as an alliance player this is quite tempting propaganda! Well played.
---
Dreadmist Robes. I farmed Drakk from Vanilla through Legion. Never dropped for me once. I gave up after all those years.
---
BUT NOT WHEN CLASSIC DROPS. I'M FUCKING GETTING THAT CHEST.
---
Thank you for covering my all-time favorite dungeon!
---
Quite sure it won't, atleast not for launch. But something they'll add later (updated textures, models etc) to make the game fresh and still good looking.
---
I wouldn't mind that at all. But I'm okey with the old graphics since the game have aged very well. The aesthetics of WoW is great and the color scheme makes the game look good even if it's actually bad and old.
---
Hey lib, I only joined Redbubble a few days ago so its a gradual process, however, I can design one today, any specific colour you would like it?
---
100% accurate.
---
easy choice. Class Quest will be after lvl60 available ==&gt; that means SHARD :)
---
You can do it! I pwomize you!

But on the picture it’s 57
---
My point was that The Forsaken are not in general like Sylvanas. 
---
The current perception is heavily influenced by how far gone Sylvanas currently is.
---
i think just like the priest / mage one would be nice. white with the default rogue symbol.
---
Please dont take ppl like him serious. How on earth would be dot specs "nonexistent" in vanilla pvp. Watch the top 10 youtube videos of "wow vanilla warlock pvp" or even google it and check the first 2 pages...
---
As for being constructive: warlock pvp heavily depends on your spec: smruin/sl/conflag. Conflag is more of a burst class with undoubtedly very little dottint involved. Smruin and sl are both a out dotting the battlefield, applying curse of tongues to enemy healers and ccing enemy healers, peeling for friendly healers. If on demand burst is needed or the enemy team has too much dispellers, the dpsing pattern shifts to shadow bolting and shadowburning  while still applying dots (specifically curses if the enemy team lacks curse dispellers). In wpvp and 1v1: conflag is bursting with direct spells and if the enemy has any leftover hp then dotting to finish. Smruin and sl are about dotting while trying to squize in some direct damage (shadowburn, nightfall shadowbolts).
---
I want to add 1 thing I was troll in vanilla mainly for raptors. 1 thing that was very disturbing about trolls and I still can’t get over it is... their feet’s you can’t use shoes and it’s super annoying same with taurens but atleast their feet’s looks way better.
---
To be honest after just kinda browsing and doing my own research, I settled on mage because of this guide.
---
[It revolves around playing as a mage](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=880)
---
Hunter and mages are the best farming classes. Take your pick.
---
There is! Legacy &gt; PvP
---
Nice! What's the best race for paladin in PvP in your opinion? I read somewhere that stoneform can remove bleeds and poisons, and even rogue's blind, which is insane! I don't know much about humans, I think they have perception and something else but I'm not sure.
---
I understand exactly how you feel. Your probably going to feel guilt whenever you get a moment to yourself. I know I did with my 3 but your still important too and if you don’t look after yourself, then it will affect everything else. 
---
 In the end I’m sure you’ll find your way. 
---
Good luck!
---
Shadowcraft legs. I spent all of spring break running UD strat. I did 10+ runs a day. I think I got them the last day before going back to school.

Great work!

May I know what's the basis for some of these being classified as hardcore/semi hardcore and what not?  
---
  I've seen some that classify under hardcore on the discord showing up here as semi hardcore.
---
King
---
I just mean that us humans have been very adept at telling stories for thousands of years, but gameplay mechanics did need some time to develop. During the time SC came out, basically every rts was 'kill all stuff on the map'. Things evolve. WC3 gameplay IS better, but some perspective is appropriate.
---
&gt; Are you a masochist that doesn't use any?
---
Though i don't see it as masochism.
---
Nah mate
---
Fair enough on the travelling if it's permanent - don't forget that Battlegrounds won't be in until phase 3 which we can expect to be roughly half a year after launch (which we don't have a date for yet, of course). So you could be talking late March 2020 before BGs even exist.
---
Wildheart shoulders.
---
Ogre magi staff as a resto druid was tough lol. After finally getting it I got some world boss feather and disc staff haha ugh
---
God damn I Wana play Diablo 2 now.
---
If you ever made I druid one as well, let me know! I love the idea
---
Did wuestie exist in vanilla or was it made specifically for p servers
---
&gt;The current perception is heavily influenced by how far gone Sylvanas currently is.
---
Yeah but that's my point exactly. It's not useful whatsoever to think of Sylvanas in Vanilla as if she's the same character in BfA when thinking about the Forsaken in Vanilla. BfA is biasing people's thinking about the Forsaken and Sylvanas, when that will not be the reality in Classic WoW, which is what this subreddit, and OP's question, is about.
---
always loved the mailed kilt/sarong things shaman get
---
more than makes up for it by fueling the warlocks with shadow weaving and VE healing to let them life tap more freely. you shouldn’t have more than one in a raid if you’re trying to min-max a bit, but one is well worth it if you have 4 warlocks to put alongside them.
---
there were a few specs that were brought not because their own dps was good, but because their net effect on dps was good.
---
I play on a p server and as soon as the boats about to leave the zone I mind control the horde and have him jump off the boat.
---
Not only does he have to swim all the way back to booty Bay he also has to wait for the next boat.
---
I added filters, I'm not sure why it's not carrying over.. I'll look into it.
---
I basically took whatever the guild described themselves as
---
Memory is a bit hazy since i was lile 13-14 back then. But the one i remember waiting for the most was udgement shoulders (paladin T2). It took ages for it to drop for me and when i finally got it i totally lost my mind 😅
---
My guess is Rogue. This is only the one class which doesn't depend on the gear. With the deep stealth talents you can pick pocketing in BRD quite well.
---
Whelpling pets.  So many whelping pets for my wife.
---
It's a big part of the game.
---
It's only when we've lost everything that we're free to slay anything.
---
Recovered my old Warlock that had 8/8 Felheart and 8/8 Nemesis last time I played. Apparently it got hacked and somebody played him to BC....all my t1 and t2 was gone out of the bank. My heart sunk so hard.
---
Dude, awesome job!  You've just made me overhyped. Can't wait anymore.
---
Activision Blizzard had $7.5 billion revenue in 2018. I guess we can expect around 300 thousand paying customers for Classic (optimistically) on the long run. Which is $54 million per year.
---
Yes, I'm sure Classic will "save" ActivisionBlizzard. :D
---
The new Aquaman movie looks great. 👌
---
Two maning with a good priest was certainly doable. It just takes longer than with a full group. These "experiments", however, are exactly what Vanilla was there for! Screw efficiency, we want the FUN back!
---
Crimson whelpling. Sold em for about 1500-3000g. I might've gotten around 20 of them all said and done. When I finally quit farming them I had about 20k gold left over after buying every skill I could get and a few mounts, and buying anything I needed for my alts. Also got my engineering to max level.
---
Quite a number, actually. Every so often we get 'success stories' on the Discord channel.
---
I have a really bad feeling that the nostalgia will die off too soon and the server I choose will be dead come Naxx..

"BfA looks like a Disney movie. Vanilla was so much darker and serious" - Classic forums.

If you are on EU this is exactly what my guild will do :)
---
One of the few classic youtubers I can stand to watch, just the right amount of memes and even though I know these dungeons by heart, I love watching these just for the nostalgia and to curb the fucking wait for a few minutes
---
2018 was their best year and they fired 800 employees. I just hope Blizzard leave Activision so they can save from cancer.
---
OP identified as a current retail player.
---
I would say it's relevant to point out that Current Retail Syllvanas / Nathanos is a poor comparison to what playing a Forsaken is like.
---
2004: 18 years old. Just finished high school. Moved to my first apartment on my own. The place looked like utter shit, with empty pizza trays all over the place. Almost got fired at my job, because I was late 2/3 days due to WoW. Played 8-12 hours a day, with a full time job
---
2019: Been to the military, sold a company, have a 7 months old soon, working for a global software company, finished university... Still looking forward to have empty pizza trays all over the place. Not sure if my GF thinks its a good  idea. :) But.... Classic WoW is def another chance to totally fuck up my life again! haha. :D

LIVE TO WIN
---
TAKE IT ALL
---
JUST KEEP FIGHTING TILL YOU FALL
---
[They also already stated that they will most likely limit Add-on functionality for stuff that they feel would be antithetical to the spirit of Classic and harmful to the authentic experience.](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2494)
---
PLEASE STAY ON PHASE 4 FOR A LONG TIME!!!
---
No, you can absolutely heal as casual. The reason is, with main tanks if you’re not there, the raid doesn’t happen. With a healer, like with DPS, you can miss a raid or two and just be replaced and it’s not a big deal.
---
I feel like you're a Brexit politician telling everyone want our vision should be. The vision for Classic is playing the old game. I'd personally love to play the old game with new updated art, and to be honest if they don't offer it I'll probably patch it myself. It's been done on private servers and works great.
---
Must have missed that one! We're adding it now.
---
Yeah I think OP is saying he found / recovered his old account. 
---
His shaman remains untouched but the game has updated around him.
---
Fixed
---
Imagine slipping Brexit into a Classicw wow post... fuck me.
---
A quick google will show that is actually quite easy for them to add the new models as a toggle. There's patches for private servers that use Legion's art to replace a lot of the models and other assets (sound effects, particle effects etc) in the game and it works fantastically. All it is is a patch file dropped in the wow folder. It looks amazing as well. The armour and other clothing is higher res too which looks good.
---
I think the biggest problem would really be deciding what to swap and what not to swap. For instance, for me I'd love the new player models. I think people forget just how basic and low res some of the old models are. However, I'd rather use like the old plaguebat model as I don't like the gargoyle-y new one.
---
A second problem would be that the old models have a texture resolution limit on the faces that is way lower than the new models, so that would have to be patched. 
---
Honestly if they literally just let us toggle the player models and that was that, it would be pretty easy to do and would be the best of both worlds. People who don't want them will never see them, people who do want them will only see them. Where's the harm.
---
Yeah, keep in mind Diablo 3 came out FIVE YEARS after it was announced. 
---
Any problem you might have with the game, wouldn't be solved by giving them more time, it was an incredibly flawed game.
---
Yeah, I remember using Reborn UI (I think that was the name) and it ate my FPS but IT LOOKED COOL DANGNABBIT!
---
I do remember it was a lot harder to replace people back then though; trying to find people through general channels whatnot, as opposed to today with the Dungeon Finder tool and summon stones etc.  
---
Sometimes you had to resort to that still, but someone stealing a vein, not sure if it’s worth throwing the run away for; considering the amount of time you would waste if you had to replace (or might end up cancelling the whole thing if people don’t want to wait around for a replacement).
---
Fun times, me(retadin) and a friend rogue being left in LBRS after a wipe. So we decided to try and 2man whatever we can, we spent hours and managed to kill a spider boss or something. Good times... release date when?
---
I can't find the words.  TotalBiscuit was the best of us. Rest in peace.
---
Pretty cool. Be sure to go to the Guilds Discord (https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq) if you want to get a full impression of these guilds and see their recruitment ads ;-)
---
If you don't stack mp5 as a shadow priest you're a moron.
---
And I'm sure you have permission from Blizzard to sell stuff with their IP... :P
---
Very nice list, thanks for compiling!
---
Now if only I could find a guild in it for me, as my luck would have it, my criteria don't yield any results even amongst over a thousand entries. (English - EU - Alliance - PvE/RP - Semi-HC/HC - Loot council)
---
Paying 40 gold to play on a PVE realm hehe
---
To me, its still freaking weird how the iconic warlock class icon uses an iconic druid spell for its icon.
---
&gt;I would say it's relevant to point out that Current Retail Syllvanas / Nathanos is a poor comparison to what playing a Forsaken is like.
---
Right. I never meant to suggest that playing a Foresaken in Vanilla WoW is the same as playing a Foresaken in Retail. I also never meant to suggest that Sylvanas in Vanilla WoW is the same as Sylvanas in Retail. To the contrary, my entire point is that they're very different, and that in Vanilla WoW, Foresaken are absolutely not objectively evil.
---
Best option for 2nd stage tbh. :)
---
Old crafty (I was alliance)
---
You can’t get a lot of good mp5 and shadow dmg gear btw. It just simply doesn’t exist, much like all the hybrid dps.
---
The items state it can be procced when melee or ranged damage (so no magic) is dealt.
---
&gt; I disagree 100%. The experience is what made vanilla special. 
---
But you can't recreate the experience. People know the game now, we have tons and tons of documentation about the gamer, each class, skills have been extensively studied. 15 years have passed.  
---
   
---
I know that most of my friends who played vanilla with me was coming from Counter Strike, with no idea about how to play a RPG properly, and it took a long time for them to understand some mechanics. This is gone, virtually everybody in the world played wow, nobody will be as noob as some was during vanilla.  
---
Even if you don't want to min-max, you'll be far better than you was during vanilla. This game have no more secret, except maybe one or two proc rate, one or two respawn rate.   
---
The vanilla experience is dead, long live the classic experience.
---
How much gold does that earn in comparison to mob grinding?
---
I did a 4 man SM Armoury with my Voidwalker tanking once. Pretty sure finished it. 
---
I also used to try to solo it on my \~41 warrior. I remember being able to kill singles easily and also 2 man packs. Can't think why I was doing it though!
---
That's a dead paladin. I thought that didn't happen.
---
Unfortunately, we have only one EU RP-PvE guild so far.
---
Healthstones are not even a thing in raids. The primary need for warlocks is CoE and CoR application and with hit gear they can do good dps too.
---
I remember my friend showed me this video and decided I was gonna farm those kara mobs until he got one of those armors too
---
The shield is also from a Hellfire Peninsula quest iirc.
---
I guess that with mining you might be able to pick dark Iron node or two as well...on the other hand again you will be stuck with BRD forever. Mage can go DM, ZG later on for far better profit.
---
Do you know the lootable what you can get from these Pickpockets? Never done this before...
---
Larval essence, for hide of the wild.  
---
The god dam grind......
---
Actually if you check the base damage arcane missiles actually does more dps than frostbolt on a naked mage. So if your gear is really bad like say a freshly dinged 60 you might actually do more dps as arcane and also not go oom as much. There is a place for everything in the game.
---
Just do what RuneScape classic did and develop from the classic game. Literally knee stuff and zones but with the 60 level cap. Essentially an offshoot new game guided by the community via voting. I feel OSRS is the closest thing to Classic wow
---
It exists, but you have to (and should) sacrifice some spell damage for it. 
---
If the fight is longer than 90 seconds it's better to equip gear with mp5 and no spell damage at all.
---
Due to the low spell coefficient of many of the shadow spells, if you have to downrank a single spell or spend any time at all wanding all that spell damage has gone to waste.
---
Your number one priority is to get as much mp5 as you need to be able to cast spells the entire fight.
---
This guide doesn’t even show good stage 1 grinding spots. It even says do Dire maul east from 53-60 which is gonna be stage 2.   Downvoted
---
Maybe make a 2nd character to farm with?
---
I'm sure with the lack of healers you will be able to get spots in content you're looking for. Even in modern WoW there is a lack of healers. Classic WoW is even worse because of no dual specialization #nochanges Kappa.
---
Man I farmed that forever. I never actually got it....
---
I farmed eye of shadow a LOT, funny thing is once I got it I never got the other half from MC because I quit my priest. He still has the eye of shadow in guild bank!
---
In stranglethorn anything goes
---
Bubble hearth on cd?
---
I’ve seen Orcbit do mc/ony/zg in ele so it’s definitely possible.
---
what do classic wow and brexit both have in common. They'll be finished by summer...............
---
Yeah just pop 15g worth of consumables every 2 min like that's sustainable.
---
Definitely shamans best friend at leveling. Realistically shaman are the only ones Ravager is useful for. Hunters don’t need it there’s no stats and warriors get whirlwind before that
---
it's insane what a grind that was.  
---
I think i've actually done it for 2 characters.....O\_o
---
This time i will roll a class, which doesn't need Hide of the wild :p
---
They’re all raid viable. Just play whatever you want
---
I love doing this. But changing talents is too expensive to do it frequently
---
This is what I’ll be looking forward to. I really wants to play ever shaman spec. In both PVE and PVP
---
I don't really have any input for PVP, I only really PVP casually at 60. But it's not true that you have to be physically playing the game any more than a DPS. In fact, if you are a good healer and do your job well, most raid teams will take note of that and give you the slightest bit of leeway. 
---
I'm going Holy paladin in Classic, and I hope to make every raid night, on time... but in the case that I can't, when life comes up, I still want to be valued enough to be kept around and invited to the next raid. 
---
As far as farming gold, I'm going to simultaneously level 2 characters to 60. While one is getting rested XP, I level the other. Leave them 5-10 levels apart so I can do a wider variety of dungeons, when a group is LF heals or DPS. My 2nd toon is probably going to be a mage, since they have great farming potential, and are fun in their own right. This will make my journey to 60 take another month or so, but *in the long run* this will save me time, and time is money, friend.
---
Did I fucking stutter
---
hey survival is hunters best spec when they are in t3 gear.
---
shadow priest are not that bad.
---
Those should have made the list:
---
prot pala
---
feral druid
---
disc priest
---
enh shaman
---
sub rogue
---
Full shaman group. Then the healers will have to tank at some point
---
I like how you two are arguing essentially the same point xD
---
This is a masterpiece
---
Having vanilla running on a modern client with 1080p as a minimum for most people just opens up for the craziest UIs. Imagine a 4k, 120hz panel running wow at 32". In theory, you could have space for several raid (8x5man groups) and still have space left to enjoy the silky smooth 120fps.
---
anders ik wel ! :D
---
This. I hated leveling back in vanilla and I hate leveling in classic. That end game gear progression tho. The excitement of chasing after the next item on your bis list. Planning out how long each grind will take and what you'll do next. This is what wow is all about. People bash on vanilla gameplay but there's more depth than retail despite pushing less buttons.
---
Hah! I'm glad it's at least entertaining :).
---
Female troll
---
Were all the whelping pets worth that much in vanilla? I remember them being pretty pricey in BC but cannot remember vanilla.
---
I'm fine with either PvE or RP, but it's the same either way. I'd be down for starting a guild with like-minded people, but I'm not really cut out to be a guild master.
---
Talent trees were in the game from the start, so they'll be there at launch in Classic
---
As always depends on your skill. On average you will get for about 40-45g/h.
---
This is gonna be good!
---
Unfortunately (or fortunately) [this madman will have to do it](https://imgur.com/a/yhR4qXV)
---
This. Enh sucks 90% of the time but when it hits it's so satisfying
---
The intro for Black Books, or Breaking Bad would make a good dingy vibe for RFK.
---
What are you talking about? People were just bad. Just look at world first videos, they were horrible at the game. I cannot even fathom how bad normal guilds were.
---
of course... but what i ask is what version will be used
---
We've all had this idea before at some point. There actually was a shaman build involving swapping weapons in combat for procs at one point but it got nerfed when they added a 1.5 second GCD to weapon swaps. The problem is when you switch weapons you lose a melee swing. If you're using heavy 2 ganders that could be potentially 3 seconds without auto attacking. So while yea you could gain extra combat stats for a short period of time you're sacrificing dps when you swap and you're also likely using a weaker weapon while fishing for said procs. It's just not worth it.
---
Great video. Just FYI I think it's much easier to get to SM as alliance by running through Western Plaguelands. You'll definitely die once, maybe twice, but its waaay quicker.
---
I used to farm the hell out of Volatile Fire in Mount Hyjal at the start of Cata, before the dungeon there opened. It was essentially a 'secret spot' at the time, as I was always there on my own - Until the dungeon opened and everyone started to wait there before the run. There were three nodes I would hit, all very near each other. By the time the I'd finished the third one, the first had almost respawned. I'd spend an hour there and made way more than enough to sell on the AH to fund whatever I was trying to do at the time. Was the richest I'd ever been while playing WoW.
---
They will be talents 1.12 patch. Blizzard have stated this even, but I don’t remember if it was at blizzcon or in a forum thread or wherever. Hopefully someone else knows the source 👀
---
From what I remember they varied based on the type, but I do remember the Crimson being about as pricey as the OP says. I wanted one and it was totally outta my price range
---
Enh shaman farming molten fists in hyjal. Trash drop 0.03....
---
Besides this, Staff of Jordan made me cringe the most, and the Arcane dmg offhand book.
---
(The Ashkandi pic is shopped btw)
---
Oh, sorry. I'm sure Blizzard have said they'll be the 1.12 talents.
---
Somebody made this cool website where you can look at bis for each class. It's layed out like the character window. Opened it Reddit, so it's not in my history. Anyone know it?
---
Of course we do... we did in vanilla, we still do now. It’s not dark age anymore, we don’t loose information like this...
---
When ZG comes out Rogue can make you extremely rich person with a Bloodvine grass. 
---
If you are going to pickpocketing the main profit would be from stealing silvers. Loot is only extra reward you don't need tables for it :)
---
Friend of mine from back in the day:
---
"All weapons are Hunter weapons. Like this staff here - that's a Hunter weapon."
---
"But all it has is +Shadow damage."
---
"Exactly. Hunters have pets. One of those pets can be a bear. Bears live in caves. You know what caves have? Shadows. Hunter weapon."
---
this but everyone in your raid does it and basically casino rolls raids at a small chance, wipes most of the time. bank on that 1% and godspeed! i hope your pvp is as fun as mine friend
---
As a shadow priest your dps doesn't matter at all. If you're oom by the time nefarian lands and can't apply shadow weaving to the boss you're absolutely useless to the raid. I don't care if you do 150 dps and wand the entire fight while spamming rank 1 SWP as long as shadoweaving is on the boss
---
And September isn't summer in the northern hemisphere but everyone keeps saying it is.
---
OP, If the WoW token makes it into Classic, thats it, I'm done. I can put up with bits of sharding, I would have put up with aweful 5-man loot trading, and so on. But a money token would *destroy* the game. 
---
Hear me out... gold is hard to come by in Classic, or at the very least its hard to get. Lets say the money token is $15, and awards you 100 gold. If I make $15/hr (I wish, but many do) it's more profitable to earn gold by working an extra hour at your job, unless you earn 100g+ an hour in WoW.
---
If I have a goal, like an epic mount, or the bloodvine set... I'm no longer thinking about *playing the game* to get what I want. I have to balance out the number of overtime hours it takes to get a certain thing. Thats a horrible way to efficiently play a game. 
---
I could always buy gold, but Blizzard selling gold themselves isn't a lesser evil. It *legitimizes the evil*. I have never bought gold in my 14 years of playing WoW. This is why I would quit if it became a *legitimate* option. It's too enticing, it saves me time, but in the process, the game DIES.
---
Used KHTM, DPSMate, Questie, Cartographer, Xloot, Gatherer and Mobinfo for a while. Recently I started playing with no add-ons and it's such a treat. Definitely going that way in classic
---
I dont remember larval acids being rare at all.  I used to farm them while waiting on people for naxx
---
Private servers would be booming. I'm not touching a private server after Classic launches... until money tokens are a thing.
---
thank you for the rapid response :)
---
I'm going to roll a druid. Mostly playing tank, maybe run 5mans as healer to some extent as well. Ended up being a dad to two small ones, so my time is limited. 
---
Won't be able to raid as much, maybe once a week. Min/maxer will argue Druid tanks can't tank raids, but don't listen to them. They are fine in MC, Ony and ZG. Won't be able to do much in BWL as time limits me anyway. 
---
Use Alchemy and Herbalism/fishing/cooking to farm some gold.
---
I think I'm a be golden!
---
Except you kind of are saying that. You're saying you want tokens, *rather* than gold farmer issues. Theres a caveat there, but you're still saying thats the option that should be in the game.
---
I meant the quest axe
---
Not 100% sure about vanilla, especially when everyone was first starting out and no one had any money, but when I started playing they were the third most expensive pet on the AH
---
Mortal Strike takes up a debuff slot. Good luck trying to do damage with an already subpar spec without using your main ability.
---

---
Ok thanks again!
---
On nost I knew a priest who ninja'd ironfoe. He would pull it out and taunt the rogues in our guild lol.
---
Seems like that screenshot is from wotlk or later (water shield, training dummy) so thats not hard evidence that it worked like that during vanilla. Just  a nit pick:)
---
3 hours a day isnt casual. I did raid on a very high level during bc and wotlk and many of our guild members played less. People seem to mix up casual in terms of time investment and casual in terms of game approach. Main tanks, class officers, main healer etc. dont need to play 40 hours a week. Its way more important these players are reliable and motivated. At one point during Ulduar I literally played 8 hours a week, only logging in for taids. I was 2nd tank.
---
Stop the dead memes man for god sake.
---
I would never buy gold risking to lose my account. But when Blizzard sells gold Ill spend alot of gold in a short time. Thinking I can skip some corners to be faster where I want to be. Just to realize that a PAY TO WIN GAME is not what I want to play.
---
The current trend in high level theory crafting is to not even run the 1 Shadow Priest because it tends to still be worse than having an extra DPS like Rogue or Warrior.
---
DPS get way stronger than healers do.
---
Priests get fucked the most, they stay squishy regardless of gear. So they're far more impactful at the beginning of vanilla. If Naxx weapons ever become common, you won't see too many priests in BGs.
---
Pallies's survivability scale better due to plate and shield but magic dps in T3 can still delete pallies. 
---
Most healing gear from raiding isn't special for PvP because it has alot of spirit and mp5 which are mostly useless in pvp. The updated epic pvp sets are the best you can get for healers except paladin who prefer using raiding gear in pvp. 
---
If I have a healer alt in classic, I probably won't bother to raid. It's not like  getting, say, the ring from Nef with a ton of spirit is gonna be of ANY help in pvp.
---
Looks savage but you have to know all history how he got it. For example, when we were raiding in Naxx in Vanilla we got \[Wraith blade\] from Maexxna for about 5-7 times in a row. When casters passed the next guy was... Paladin! :D
---
\+10 health per tick when sitting, doesn't affect mana
---
We're expecting a Classic Summer, not a Summer of Waiting for Classic. Pls.
---
Exactly
---
I tought forsaken followed Sylvanas by choise because shes the only one caring enough about us.
---
What a massacre. 
---
Azeroth will have an over abundance of pork, crashing the meat market and making countless butchers homeless and destitute. Thoughtless massacres have consequences, terrible consequences..
---
Imagine if they just blue posted and said "Yeah it's coming out tomorrow". I think the sub would melt
---
Exactly. [I made this handy flowchart back then.](https://i.imgur.com/MFDYj0n.png)
---
Huh? You do need one mage to go deep frost, it's not disrespectful. It's basically the opposite.
---
True but getting a raiding spot as a hunter in a decent guild is much harder than getting a spot as a warlock. Though that's not what OP asked.
---
Exactly how I ended up with a Thunderstrike on my Paladin. Except change "casters passed" to "everyone passed"
---
[Add a zero to that number](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C-%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88/%D0%94%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD/pvp)
---
OMG ultranut
---
Arcane is the best mage talent tree, it offers a lot of utility and every mage spec contains lots of points in arcane. It's just you don't use arcane spells to do damage.
---
I think it has a place in retail, transmog makes 7 expansions worth of content relevant again. Though all mogging should be blocked in competitive PvP
---
Still have the Mr Crafty I caught whilst waiting for BGs to pop!
---
You could Polymorph someone next to a wall, and they would walk through it, bypassing the invisible barrier.
---
That's how you got into old Ironforge and into Nessy's aquatic paradise for example :)
---
I think you are forgetting that people don't raid for 30 hours per week anymore. Raiding only 3-6 hours a week it will be harder to do that.
---
I never really see people use the word autumn usually.
---
Most mother fuckers just say fall
---
I’ve always feared the ud rogue with the black enchant
---
The actual point I reference in at the 15 minute 43 second mark. Each time I tried to post it just started the video from the beginning, reddit wouldn't leave the time stamp in, oh well.

Wish the live team cared like this, here is hoping the classic team is as devoted as this old team was.

source link: Control+Shift+C in browser -&gt; Double click on element that you want to edit -&gt; Fill in your preferred release date -&gt; press enter.
---
It's their game, they'll release it when they want to.
---
Can't go wrong with mage when being introduced to WoW and more fun than priests unless she wants to heal.
---
Disgustingly large shoulderpads.
---
Well, it's not that hard as a healer. On a pserver I play 3 days a week (2 days of raiding and 1 extra when I'm bored). I use enchanting for some passive income (not much) and herb for consumables. Currently the only expensive boss is C'thun because of grater shadow and nature resistance pots. 
---
Usually I team up with a tank from the guild to farm Strat live. 1-2h of herbing and 2-3 orb runs and you are all set for a week of raiding and some extra gold for keeping gear up to date. Also the gold you get from MC and BWL is around 80g.
---
I tried farming DME farming but it is boring. 
---
You have nothing to worry about.
---
&gt;Will Ganking be a Problem?
---
i fucking hope so
---
Not for me on a pve server
---
Well theoretically youre playing arcane you r just not spamming arcane missiles and explosion.
---
Ultimately vanilla is about playing a class not a spec anyway
---
You cant get into june and still not have a proper release date though? so they have to announce the actual date some time before june, they should release the date some time by the end of this month in all fairness.
---
Assuming the first phase of Classic, so only Onyxia and MC are out, how long can you assume it would take to get a full tier set / accompanying items for each class? Assuming you clear MC and Ony each week, is it safe to assume you will get one item a week? Or is it more like one item per 2 weeks? 
---
I know it depends on class, exact numbers of each class etc., just looking for a rough guesstimate if anyone has one.
---
Questing in phase 2 ? You mean when i level my 2nd alt, maybe ?
---
Them dopid people! 
---
I usually never see the word usually and never in the same sentences! But who really cares!
---
Asscandy isn't that bad on a hunter since it's pretty much a pvp roll anyway.
---
I will play on a PVE server because I want to have fun and I don't want to be the catalyst of anyone's frustration/whatever brings you to waste time in such a useless practice.
---
&gt;The goal of the project is to bring back the game, not the experience (which is a nebulous, entirely subjective concept). If you understand and accept that, you'll understand why there should be no changes.
---
Then you shouldn't trouble yourself with this game and should unsub from this subreddit. The game is not getting bought back, a new game is being developed which is similar to the original one.
---
Since I'll presumably be one of the first Alliance to 60 on the server (hunter taking a week or so off around launch), I'll happily be part of the Redridge defense force when I'm nearby. No better feeling than ganking gankers.
---
I would second this. Mage is probably the better option if you are wanting convenience + gold.
---
Yeah it's just a better Zin'Rokh basically.
---
What a great tool and idea! Spread the word!
---
Too bad they're all AV graveyard camping kills. The Russian server is where that whole idea came from.
---
I don't see any problem with ganking on any level difference. If you really don't like that aspect of the game PvE servers are made exactly for that reason. World PVP is not a fixed scenario like bgs or duels. It's an unpredictable living story made only by players choices. Be the evil raider slaughtering the innocent, local defender of the scrubs, assassin, poly/sap troll or a soldier in an army of Southshore Tarren Mill conflict. This is what makes the game for me. PvE will eventually get boring but this is always good stuff because of its chaotic nature.
---
You make a good point lol
---
Make a bunch of decent meals way in advance. Get every last possible chore out of the way beforehand - give the flat a complete once-over. Make sure I have some movies/TV lined up in case I have to wait for servers to become usable. Tell friends to piss off for a week.
---
Not a spec you see in raids often
---
You have imp strength totem as a resto shaman. Only imp wf is to deep in enhancement. But sure you don't need to be deep resto to heal. I healed as (30/0/21) back in the day when we raided mc,bwl,zg and aq20. Respeced for progression raids
---
I’m going to be multiboxing 40 in classic so I’m going to spend the first couple hours creating 40 characters and running all my night elf’s and humans to the dwarf/gnome starting zone. I’m also going to set up all my characters bars with macros for all the abilities they’ll be getting (“/cast fireball” will always cast your max rank of fireball) so I’ll do that for just about every ability on 40 characters lols
---
Shape-shifting cancels everything a Mage can do.
---
Mage BRD is allegedly better then Hunter Mara by a noteworthy margin. For me, I'm happy with Mara farm because that's my stomping ground.
---
&gt; Before I continue I should state that by casual I would consider this 2 - 3 hours a day.
---
Regarding time spent that's enough for hardcore. The only thing that will give you trouble is self-inflicted insistence on sucking at the game.
---
windfury
---
I meant it as funny, and not condescending 😁
---
Farming all those major mana pots and dark runes can suck, but it's far less than the responsibility of a tank: guilds will bring along suboptimal healers because they need plenty.
---
You stack AGI, not AP.  Agi scaling was just way too good.  AP was less bad on Horde, but your options are limited AP wise due to weapon classes.  You would be looking at mainly Axe or Polearm.
---
Jinkrok was a common enough hunter weapon in vanilla.  When you look into it though, its all bad.  [Peacemaker](http://itemization.info/item/18725) outclasses most of the AP weapons for hunter.
---
I doubt it’s going to be a blue post. Release date will probably come with at least a classic Q and A that they announce a week in advance. My loins are telling me the next update will basically just be a post that says submit your questions for next weeks stream.
---
They're a very fun set but no-one considers them optimal even factoring in weapon swapping.

Hey Lib, I've uploaded the mug the Rogue mug! I hope you like it :)
---
2-3 hours a day isn't casual.
---
I will play semi progress with a little more time spend in game on weekends.
---
But I'm can't play more than 2-3 hours after work.
---
my partner said she'd leave me if i got back into it :D

"A wand! A wand! My kingdom for a wand!"
---
Barons mount, mounts in general over the years though. I ran strat probably 3-5x times a day for a solid couple of months trying to get that mount, never even saw it.
---
Later on it was headless horseman mount, wasn't nearly as rare but everybody wanted it and I just never won a roll for it.
---
Then I came back for a short stint in MOP and like everybody else wanted the heavenly onyx cloud serpent, which I never saw drop.
---
It's coming out tomorrow but it will be on mobile only.

Ganking is a problem on private servers where there are 5x as many people online at any given time than there would be on a classic server. You might think that there would be that many more max levels out there preventing the ganking but in reality the only people ganking level 20s in red ridge are undead rogues, and those fuckers are invisible. 
---
But on classic there will be that many less rogues with nothing better to do, so will it be a problem? Nah.
---
lets be real no one likes a 5 minute boss rush. bring back the 14 day sieges or dont release AV
---
“Summer is coming”
---
Ok but you have to wonder what is the goal? If you went full authentic with bugs and exploits then what is the point? It's just waste of everyone's time of creating unplayable game. Ultimately the goal is to create good playable game, isn't it?
---
For example, having honor system without BGs has an equally negative effect on the game than  exploits and cheats have. Ditto for original black lotus mechanics. I am not talking about removing arrows or soul shards like some retard. I am talking about true exploit level gamebreaking stuff.
---
Just farm on your main.
---
The 200 hours you spend levelling the alt can be used to accumulate mucho golds. 
---
Fish, cook, herb, mine, alch and skin.....
---
All these can be done by anyone.
---
Stage 1 &amp; 2 will both be like this on pvp servers but on phase 1 quest hubs will get wiped clean as there are no dishonorable kills.
---
Are there Naxx icons included? I could not find any.
---
Anyway thanks for that pack!
---
While my main is going to be a warrior and they need gold, i dont think i will level aother char to 60 first just to farm gold, by the time i will be able to cap my warrior we might aswell be in phase 3 - im a filthy casual
---
Well, no, a good player would still be more useful on a more meta spec.
---
On PvP server 100% especially as there is no dishonorable mech to punish. Some people will spend their time locking down quest hubs by slaughtering every single living being in it.
---
You don't need 40 people in the raid. I would honestly take 30 people if it meant cutting out 10 ret pallies/survival hunters/boomkins that are going to roll on gear that other players doing 5x their dps need.
---
If they're planning this for ahead they're way too hc for me
---
If you don't want to believe what Blizzard themselves are saying and doing, that's your choice. :)
---
New models also don't really align with classics low poly armor&amp;sets. Would look funky to say the least
---
But only Sony Ericssons and Motorolas for that Classic feel
---
While it would bring more players, the game is not designed the token in mind so I belive it would have several negative effects.
---
**&lt;Blood Moon&gt; [Alliance-PvP] [EU] is now recruiting!**
---
We're in the *early stage of forming a semi hardcore*, or to be more specific, **EXPERIENCED CASUAL** guild.
---
By "experienced casual" we mean that we do not actively encourage min maxing but we do want our members to be familiar with classic wow (or private servers). We don't want to rush to endgame, instead we will take our time to smell the roses (again), do quests and dungeons together (we accept memespecs, too :P ), some wpvp, etc.
---
Our goal is to be a *big guild with a friendly environment and an active, mature playerbase that keeps the guild chat/discord alive at all times and members who will not hesitate to help their brethrens in need even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange*
---
**we WILL raid** at some point, although we do not have specific plans for endgame *yet*
---
feel free to join the discord so we can get to know each other until classic launch!
---
 **https://discord.gg/ZSsSz7E**
---
That's true, the last thing I would want is a token, but I really wouldn't be surprised if they implemented one
---
Looks pretty terrible lol
---
Facepalm
---
I recommend disassociating Classic lore from BfA lore. In vanilla, the only way in which she can be called evil is in being heartless when it comes to anything that stands in her way of getting revenge on Arthas. She doesn't hate all life and she's doing the best she can to guide her race of undead which are all in the exact same shitty situation that she is.
---
As far as I'm concerned, the reason for hating Undead is crappy BfA writing to forcibly create a Garrosh v2. But this ain't BfA.
---
Where do you look up information for the spells and abilities?
---
Horde raid can get mind controlled by alliance team, pally-buffed and then go raiding with those buffs.
---
Probably just me making a mistake, cheers.
---
&gt; Like if blizzard offered to redo all the quests so that we wouldn't know any of them on the top of our head(assuming that blizzard could actually recreate the same style and design of quests ofc). Then we would have something that's closer to the feel of vanilla because you didn't know what you were doing
---
That wouldn't change anything. You can easily forget most quests and it didn't change anything because the overall framework of questing itself is figured out. You have figured out everything a quest can possible be and how to do it, you don't need to know any particular quest itself at all.
---
Ring of Law visitors? Supposedly it was bugged on a pserver and some use nets, therefore it's not useable unfortunately.
---
Will be interesting to see if they indeed net or if it was a moneymaking scheme by corrupt pserver admins.
---
I’m pretty sure my phone is more powerful than the computer I originally played WoW on so you know what I’ll give it a shot.
---
Because nothing feels worse then watching weapons drop and never being considered.
---
I think you are correct on the name, that rings a bell.
---
Yeah, I remember in the guide saying that if you want this build to work you better roll a night elf.
---
damn i forgot about the triprunner dungarees
---
Play the game.
---
so all the exploits and bugs should be there as well?
---
Almost don’t want to turn them in.
---
Mage: Blizzard AOE farm.
---
Rogue: Lockbox pickpocket farm
---
Paladin: SM silk farms / power leveling service.
---
Criiiinge
---
i've refreshed my memory, but it was living essence.  
---
Those where the hard ones to farm :)
---
I mean the least you should do is to explictly advertise your guild as „memespec“-friendly or you would‘ve really waste other serious raiders time. That‘s doesn‘t mean you only run with balance druids, ret pallys and smite priests. Everyone who is alright with this guild philosophy can run with em.
---
I hope you’re right. 
---
I suppose a server wide discord would do the task too.
---
Infra said that he doesn't know if the respawn time/ loot is correct on pserver. So this spot may not work in classic.
---
They say they want Classic to be like a museum piece, yet they use a completely different client and backend infrastructure than what vanilla had for obvious monetary reasons. This goes against that completely. So in your viewpoint Classic won't be what you expect it to be.
---
lol at comparing honor farming with world pvp
---
There's still a duplicate on EU "Bronze Dragonflight" Horde side. A person named "Kinfowl" shows up twice.
---
I'll be at work (don't intend to take the day off) so I'll check this sub often to see what's happening.
---
Same as before since I was already an adult with a full-time job.
---
As long as the baby’s diapers are changed and The wife gets a good pounding I’m allowed to stay up all night.
---
&gt;  I don’t remember if it was at blizzcon
---
It was at last Blizzcon during the Classic Panel.
---
Thanks for your work! I hope more people will sign up, 18000 entries is really nice but compared to the number of players at the time it's still way too low, sadly. So far I'm the only one who signed up for my server.
---
Dude, third time I see this posted. Are you lowkey trying to promote your video or something lol?
---
Hot dauym that would have been a xp chunk!
---
Yeah, herbalism. Also fishing for rage potions.
---
Oh, that’s not very much.
---
on one pserver me and two friends made a guild called &lt;no tank no heals np&gt; and we 3-manned every instance up to (and including some of) BRD.  we were mage/rogue/lock.
---
it was a lot of fun, we had to make good use of cc and kiting that's for sure
---
nearly 3 bars! haha
---
Yeah I get why its in retail. Shit, tier sets arent even a thing anymore, and everyones armor looks the same, if there wasnt Xmog, everyone would just be gray blobs with stats.
---
no life it 24/7 eating food all day and talking with friends
---
I don't see any way it can come out before august/september. New raid just came out on BFA and 8.2 patch probably comes out around end of next month. By looking at the past releases of patches we know that they will hold on releasing the raid from 8.2 atleast a month, so late june/early july. Blizzard is not going to release classic when the latest raid is less than a month old. Early september would be my guess.
---
The unlockable Salem's chest in Tirisfal Glades had some mystery surrounding it. There was some riddles on Thottbot at the time for finding the key. But as far as I know, the key is not ingame.
---
Ugh, fuck Viper sting. If a hunter gets this off on me, and I don't have a solid opening, im screwed!
---
Play PvE if you dont wanna be ganked simple as that
---
Ok bro lol. Btw worldbuffs were turned off for the first month if every raid tier.  You have no idea what your talking about
---
I plan all my free time around my hobbies.
---
watching old dev videos for the vanilla/bc era always blows my mind tbh. such a different mindset back then.
---
also u said two Force Reactive Disk? why two?
---
Total biscuit was an inspiration to me as a young female gamer to build my own PC’s, play WoW and excel in raiding despite the shit I got at the time. I’ll always miss his influence in our industry but he helped get this girl on a path to a CS degree and be a WoW nerd for life
---
are you going to post this every hour?
---
actually it was about 40% of a level iirc
---
I was kinda disappointed to be honest
---
It's a good estimate based on blizzards release history lately.
---
Warrior tanks can make 40g a live start run.
---
Jesus those are horrible ripoffs. Extremely lazy. Also, please stop posting this
---
Force Reactive Disk loses 1 Durability every time you block. They break fast.
---
They were a cultural icon before gaming and internet was mainstream. So many millions of people playing your game, many times more than anticipated. It made them change their vision
---
You kidding? they are hands down the best pvp healer, by a huge margin, Plate, shields, nearly impossible to oom, cleanse, can break CC's on yourself with BOS and bubble, keep your warriors hitting things with BOF and cleanse, keep your mages from getting exploded with bubbles.
---
They also make raiding MUCH easier so its easier to gear up and severely outgear your opponents, never running out of mana and blessing of salv are insane.
---
wasn't that in 1.12?
---
Sockets in classic.
---
When you actually played vanilla, at or near launch, this didn't happen, you were so happy to just find where to go on a quest, find the mobs, spend an hour getting 4 zebra hooves, then you just went to hand it in to get that xp
---
And nothing beat getting an epic.... Even if you knew it was bad, purple &gt; blue
---
There was a NE druid who I believe almost unlocked rank 15. He held grandmarshall for 14 months, only losing it at TBC patch. Kuroma on Daggerspine. (I think)
---
Head slot drops off Gandling. Probably that one.
---
what do you man exactly ?
---
get a life and go outside??
---
And no addons for that extra help lol
---
Ooooph delicious xp
---
What class OP?
---
Seconding lazypig, although I dont know if it will work in classic.. Hope it does!
---
rogue!
---
Alt tab + thottbot was the original addon.
---
obviously, but that wasn't what that guy was talking about
---
I think a lot of people forget that Battlegroups are cross realm BGs that were added in 1.12.
---
The funny thing for me is the order I turn these in so that I ensure nothing turns green if I level up during the process
---
I love un'goro for that reason alone.
---
Can some clarify what Seni-Casual, Semi-Hardcore and hardcore would entail in term of raiding hours and expected time to play out of raid for Buffs and pots etc etc
---
I love Un’Goro.
---
Perfect!
---
Sure. Doing it like that is the best way anyway, just don't be one of those guys who deliberately don't listen to what other people has to say about the subject. 
---
Like what "try-hards" actually do is more or less theorycraft their own builds, but to do that and get good results you need to read up on information about the different talents. It's a bit like science, you don't just discover everything for yourself, you use the information others have already discovered to do your own thing. 
---
Just blindly following a build is not good either. Much better to actually know what your talents does and stuff, so your attitude is good.
---
The toggle got removed because of the new animations introduced with Legion. I also think it is weird, considering there are plenty of toys with botched or no animations at all when you use a spell - but I guess they just don't want that for the actual player races. I guess keeping that option would've been the best bet, even if most animations wouldn't be able to pop up.
---
Can’t blame him. Back then nobody knew what the bindings were for and the tooltip said that Rogues, Warriors, Paladins and Hunters can use it.
---
You bet ya tauren teets it will be my frand!
---
we have no idea how feasible the old strats are
---
either the old classic or the pserver ones
---
yeah full ungoro Circle is About 1/2 lvl
---
Oh yes.. I remember the hours and hours on thottbot
---
You don't get less XP for a green quest turn in. The xp reward is the same.
---
&gt; It's not even about the pure mechanics of memespecs. It's about the mentality and culture of players that are ok with wasting other people's time and allowing deadweight in the raid when they have very limited time to play in the first place. 
---
This only matters to people who have endgame PvE as their only goal. Many people (to not say most) don't give a fuck how fast they progress in raids. I didn't raid more than 8-10 hours / week in Vanilla. With my last guild, we went to mid AQ40, and we only stopped because of TBC.
---
And that mentality and culture you're talking about is only a hardcore pserver player cancer that will not be mainstream in Classic.
---
If you are doing a GRIND ALT MAGE, does it really matter that DME is in stage 2 ? If stage 2 is about 4 months after stage 1, you easily might still be level-upping your mage (depending how much you focus on it).
---
The discipline to not hand any in and to wait.
---
Hey u/DarkPhenomenon, this is an awesome tool! The only issue I see so far is that some Reddit links do not go to the intended LFG post. For example, I'm looking for NA/PvE/Alliance/Casual, and some of the links for those listings will go to a different guild's post, or even to a PvP/Horde LFG post.
---
An example of this issue can be shown by clicking on the link for guild entry #174
---
No - how could it possibly be a problem when they have PvE servers available.  If somebody views getting killed by other players as a ‘problem’, then why the hell are they playing on a PvP server?  
---
It’s like insisting on using only women’s public restrooms as a man and bitching that there aren’t any urinals in them.  The solution to your ‘problem’ is readily available and accessible - just use the men’s restroom (right next door) like you’re supposed to, dumbass.
---
Unproportionally way more ppl will buy gold, if there gonna be wow tokens. correct. and it'll affect the game drastically.
---
So if you don't see the difference between letting ppl buy tokens and some ppl buying it under the rug, and that it doesn't change anything, i don't know what to say to you. 
---
This type of a binary, black and white thinking is what doesn't let some ppl see the reality clearly. and they resort to dichotomies in their brain to process the reality. thats rather sad. 
---
Some obscure example: some people kill people anyways, so lets not punish them for that, and maybe even offer legit killer services. cos, you know, anyways if person wants to do it, he finds a way to do it. this kind of thinking.
---
Im not sure about gph, but on pservers I saw ppl running/forming ubrs groups and selling/locking Titans Flask recipe and loot.
---
I think you don't really understand how game development works. If you want to read and watch about Classic development, here are links: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
As far as I can tell, Classic will be exactly what I expect it to be. Vanilla recreated quite faithfully.
---
Most are linked to loot... like loot tables are based on A) WHO enters the raid instance first, B) Whos the RL, what CLASS is the RL/ML. Shit like that.
---
The title says pre stage 2.  He’s looking for a gold farmer that will net him the most gold in the first stage
---
Mage BRD farming won’t be possible due to he Net mobs and the healers
---
Yessir, even played that Warhammer Online with JC and friends.
---
Beautiful. Elemental right? They do crazy dmg :o
---
Sockets weren't in classic.
---
When ZG comes out there also will be a Bloodvine set which is the BIS set for every single DPS caster. Rogues can solo farming Bloodvine grass which may cost up to 30g per 1 in the start of the phase 4.
---
That's t0. T0.5 is purple.
---
As long as PvE servers exist, you are agreeing to potentially be camped for hours by creating on a PvP server. "PvE server ---&gt;" will be brought back as it was used 14 years ago.
---
the mobs just drop the herbs
---
THat's the vanilla version, the current version has a haste proc and is level 58 i believe.
---
I remember that actually,. No one in the raid before me, or I'll take your dkp!   Haha.
---
&gt;I think you don't really understand how game development works.
---
I do.
---
Hey mate, can't wait for your leveling guide! I want to level quickly to get to the sweet 60 lvl and get to serious farming reputations. =)
---
Retail was absolutely made with roleplay in mind, even disregarding everything else you said. It was an MMO***RPG*** after all, and it has many Roleplaying and Roleplaying Game systems that have been abandoned recently.
---
good to know, so its a good idea to turn in those greens if they will level you before they turn grey, instead of leveling off a orange or yellow quest.
---
Wowclassicbis.com
---
Yeah that's what I was think, Wildheart cowl lol, didn't want to say the wrong name tho haha.
---
Never managed baron mount or headless horseman but one of the last things I did in retail was get Huolon
---
my first character to 60 was a dwarf warrior and a part of me is ready to go back to ally. This time I am leaning paladin though
---
Yeah, grey quests get an XP reduction. But greens are fine.
---
nice taste bro, looking good
---
OK bud. It happened all the time but whatever you say.
---
Going to work -&gt; Going to the gym -&gt; Going home playing for 3-4h, after all, it is only game and I have a life outside it.
---
Vael was called the guild killer you moron. Not even reading the rest of your post seeing as you have no fucking memory from back then.
---
Warlock &gt; shadow priest
---
Yes guild banks should be implemented in Classic
---
As someone who is in leadership of a guild forming for classic I can say that I am not looking forward to organising guild bank alts. The labour intensity is tedious and enormous, all it does is add to the burnout risk for officers.
---
I only see a couple of very small nuanced ways in which this would change the dynamics of Classic (1) bag economy but really this is mostly with players...guildbanks are not the main demand source...
---
(2) “community building” in the sense that you need to build trust with players entrusted with guild assets - there are many other ways this is already established/founded in Classic, no need to add guild banks to officer workload for the sake of expanding the ways we build trust which already has to be there in /o in the first place
---
Yep same with /r/2007 scape. They kept old models, while RS3 has new and updated models.
---
Yes, it is true, I can't remember the exact hit and crit chance, but I think they were the same as melee one.  If you don't lack on hit - the spec isn't really worth it especially for PvE where you will be stuck the xbow from BWL for a long time, once you have it.
---
As troll you need 6% hit.
---
There are no range glancings.
---
Mages could blink through also no?  I was always hoping that door would lead to a mines of moria style event.
---
i am suprised you noticed the totem before the updated orc model
---
it's not at higher lvl but when you find yourself at 20min walk from the nearest food vendor on a lvl 25 it's quite good.
---
Always keep a spirit gear in your bag
---
It's not incredibly valuable, most of the best ranged weapons for hunters are crossbows anyway. Berzerking on the other hand is far more valuable.
---
Do you remember what unit frame addon you were using?
---
It's true, bows arent subject to glancing blows. It's either a hit or a miss.
---
The extra skill does help with a small amount of additional hit, crit, etc.
---
Well, maybe just a hint to others, if we assume that OP is going for mage main.
---
Aye, thanks!
---
Being the Main Tank of a guild clearing PvE content does require you to be present at basically every raid, have the best upgrades (enchants, consumables etc) and be generally extremely active. This is because you will get loot priority. Therefore if you only turn up half the time.. well, A) it's a waste of time prioritising gearing you up if you aren't going to be present. B) A key item (bindings of windseeker for example) may drop when you're not present. Plus there may only be 3-4 Main Tanks in the guild and of those 3-4 there will be the number 1. (All of which will be Warrior in Vanilla btw)
---
The reason for priority is because the better geared your tank, the less pressure it puts on healers, and the harder the dps can go in terms of threat generations etc. 
---
As for healers, gear is nice but in no way determines progression in the same way a tank gearing up can. Plus there will be 8/9/10 of you in the raid and it's a pretty flexible role, also there will be other classes so the pressure isn't all on you, therefore a more flexible playstyle is ok.
---
Ganking will be less prevalent than it is on private servers imo just because there'll be less players on that one server than say, Nostalrius had. Personally one of the reasons I'm so glad Blizzard are making Classic is to play on a PVE server.
---
Paladin can AOE farm too though.
---
It's a + damage stat to the weapon so it doesn't work.
---
Good? As I said I don't worry about Classic, so at this point I don't think this thread has any point in continuing. :)
---
But why does it need to be fresh and good looking? Not everything modern is better, neccesarily.
---
2007 runescape didn't upgrade their graphics, even if RS3 had.
---
Happened on my server. First binding dropped before any information about them was out. Everyone who could use it rolled hunter won it. Two weeks later other binding dropped and he made the sword. At least he got to play melee hunter. Guild got 7 more left bindings and not a single other right for all of vanilla.
---
I used to go oom as a mage in classic I mighta been a bad mage
---
Lok'amir is easily one of the most beautiful weapons in vanilla.
---
I asked in last sentence if you plan to level your gold-farmer over the main first, so I thought its obvious that its alt character :-)
---
Chances are if you're wiping in a dungeon so bad that all of your gear is red, the people you're running the group with are shit, and reputation with them doesn't matter at all. First few pulls you can usually find out if the group is solid or not.
---
It happening doesn't make it better though. This isn't even from a tryhard min-maxing standpoint but a rather basic *you're negatively impacting the raid*.
---
Go back to your shitty workshop you chinese boy
---
So bad
---
Yes it didn't exist back in the day because people hadn't figured it out yet. But after more than a decade of playing this on pservers people have worked out optimal strategies. 
---
Perhaps the numbers will be different on release but unless it is changed so that 49-59 gives significantly reduced honour to a 60 then why wouldn't people do the optimal strategy that is tried and tested for years previously?
---
Plus, you need to get to that part of LBRS, which isn't easily accessible.
---
Tfw when, the feeling when when
---
So rude
---
Thank you!
---
And why stick with old graphics for no reason when you could let the players choose?
---
I think the quest colours giving more / less xp is the biggest questing myth. It does make sense, however - would be a shitty system that a quest at any given level up could suddenly grant you reduced xp with no warning.
---
The Barons mount is the one thing I have from vanilla, that I felt made my character (human) look so damn cool. There were like 3 on the server in total, 2 on alliance and 1 on horde.
---
I still use it as my mount on retail to this day :D
---
Hopefully you have a warlock in your group so you can hearth/repair/summon :)
---
I love how the totem is what set you off, not the new orc model texture looking horribly mismatched to the low quality of vanilla gear.
---
Just pay attention to the abilities / spell bar
---
Fuck Un’Goro so much haha
---
If you're gonna kill a paladin, bring 2 rogues.
---
The second one should be stealthed in the Ironforge Inn.
---
*TFW you play a boomkin in vanilla.*
---
it's on the internet so it must be true
---
Yeah I mean that’s theory crafting though, not reality. Huge difference
---
Because it's part of the charm of the game.
---
Wouldn't call it being set off, but shiz haven't even seen vanilla models since tbc. Need a side by side to notice at this point
---
&gt; And that mentality and culture you're talking about is only a hardcore pserver player cancer that will not be mainstream in Classic.
---
Lmao What makes you think classic will be anything other than yet another pserver fresh? There's way more people from pservers and retail than people stuck in 2004. And even fewer people who will stay stuck in 2004.
---
M’goodboy!
---
Yeah that's what I mean, they have two damaging arcane spells. Easy to see why they're just vending machines
---
Me fighting C'thun anno 2006
---
Oh boy i remember lvling a warrior to get that sword from SM that procs a spin attack. Beautiful memories :D
---
I will wait a couple of days 
---
Look at what would be the best realm for me 
---
and if i see that servers are ok I will try to find a balanced horde/alliance realm AND then get a couple of days off from work and lvl 60 here i come
---
By "set off" I don't mean in a ragey way, just as in what made you notice it wasn't vanilla.
---
Btw, the vanilla models were used up until WoD, so shouldn't be that far away to remember. Unless you didn't play any pre-WoD xpacs aside from TBC.
---
Personally it just strikes my eyes when textures are wildly different like here.
---
Big thumbs up for Un'goro Crater...!!
---
Yeah i'm going to play wow classic with some IRL Friends i'm going to try to level a lot from instances with them :D No need for sun when you have spray tan lul
---
Nice list man although we (birds of a feather) are actually alliance. We were going to go horde but swapped about a week ago. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Just so you know, you can easily solo farm the barman shanker, you dont need a group for it. I did it on my rogue. You just stealth past all of the mobs and go straight to the bar.
---
Hello Sharding
---
I farmed Warden staff, the epic world drop, for my druid.
---
I stopped after the second epic world drop.
---
Lei of Lillies x2...
---
I'll be going Alliance so I'm sure I win most duels.
---
i dont have a problem with long phase 1 and 2. 6 month would not be a problem for me. i actually think its better than to rush the phases.
---
If a quest is orange it's best to do it. Because if you need to kill 10 boars for example each boar will grant you a bit extra XP. But the turn in of the quest in it self still grants you the same amount of XP. 
---
However, when a quest is green, the XP gained is less % of your level. Say a quest grants you 1000XP and you need 10000 xp to level then the quest is 10% of your level. Or you are 1 or 2 levels higher and you would need 12000 xp to level. Then the 1000xp you get is less % of your level. so it's just 7% or 8% of your level. 
---
But the base XP for turn in is the same at each level. Except when a quest is grey.
---
Im very fond of trolls overall, but seriously I think Undead Male might have the best casting animation out of all all races independent of faction. the wiggle before the cast finish is just awesome and hectic. However i like how the Troll bends and lean like they are steadying their cast. Its just so hard to pick which one you love in the long run.
---
Tl;dr Casting Animations are in the eye of the beholder.
---
Phase 1 is long because it’s gonna take the average person 2-3 months to hit 60. And it makes sense to let those people atleast attempt MC while it’s current content.
---
Yes some people will rush to 60 and start on mc, but it definitely won’t be on farm anytime soon. 4-6 months per phase is a perfect mix between old timer with family and no lifer playtime.
---
This is great. Only recommendation would be to create a standardized column for raid start times. Make them all the same time zone (EST or CET or something)
---
In the end it boils down to 2 things, 1. do you like/hate shoes? 2. Do you like/hate bones sticking out of your fine dress.
---
Unless mentioned, assume 1.12.0.
---
Yes I'm replying to clueless person who thinks he is remembering something that didn't even exist.
---
What does that even mean? It's a conclusion made by comparing performance across several different raid makeups.
---
Life of a Mage in Ony
---
Sometimes it takes people MONTHS to get to 60, literally months. 6-7 months to get to 60 was completely normal in retail Vanilla WoW. This is why the first phase needs to be so long, it sets the foundation for the game. It allows people to fully experience phase 1 without feeling like they are getting rushed by phase after phase, not able to catch up. If anything, speeding up phase 1 will cause people to quit.
---
Did you play when it first came out? You sound like one of those snowflakes that got easy mod WoW and think its the same. It will be months before most guilds are ready to hit up MC and months later when we could hit up Onyxia. Trust me you will have plenty of things to do before that time comes for pvp. Dont forget attunment for onyxia.
---
Retail vanilla doesn't even matter bro. People don't take months and months to level anymore. People watch guides online, people figure out how to play efficiently, etc etc, we see this all the time on private servers, and in every single mmo that comes out.  If you think slowing down the content to a crawl is good, you're delusional bro. Reddit needs to start listening to the people who've actually been playing the game...
---
The thinking is Phase 2 will be worse because there's now an incentive to *farm* other players rather than just killing them for shits and giggles. 
---
I have no pserver experience but I did play Vanilla and I definitely don't remember the honor system making ganking any worse either, though.
---
Yah, he is the warlock.
---
Because your deck has less card advantage than your opponent.
---
If you're playing constructed, it could just be that your decks aren't the same quality as your opponent's, or if you're netdecking you may be making bad plays.
---
If you're playing Arena, then it's probably a combination of not drafting optimally and not making optimal plays.
---
Your deck has to have a win condition. This is usually to beat them faster than they can sustain themselves, beat them on card advantage, or beat them with a combo. If you're not executing any of these strategies effectively, then you'll probably stall out and lose on card advantage.
---
This is what I call a fucking PAYDAY!

Ele shaman is crazy burst :D
---
I'm strictly speaking of handing in a quest - for that you should always go green &gt; yellow &gt; orange &gt; red.
---
As for your analyse, I disagree. Yes, the mob xp is higher due to higher level mob, but that is not all. First of all, they take longer to kill. Especially a warrior or rogue might not benefit from the extra xp if they need to eat afterwards. It is actually often advised to *not* go for orange quests if you are one of the weaker leveling classes, as it is much better to do questing faster and get a bit less mob xp.
---
Actually, your "orange is best due to mob xp" is only relevant for very few. A hunter might benefit, but even then it does take longer to kill so haven't done the math for this outcome. 
---
And then there is the aspect of the gameworld not being isolated. Often doing orange mobs means you have to spend much more time pulling smart and avoid additional enemies. This also cause you to spend more time.
---
As for green quests, I agree that it is good to know that it grants less than a yellow quest. This is often not relevant, as you want to do green quests along with other quests and they are usually easy, but if you pick up a green quest and got no other quest in the area then you might consider dropping it.
---
I think you are vastly over estimating the speed with which the average person gets to 60.
---
True but there is quite some time before BWL releases once Classic releases and furthermore the odds of it dropping comboed with that ur probably not the only one wanting it... ur gonna use a bow for quite some time still and worst case u could end up not having it even at AQ.
---
if the bow skill really equals melee weapon skill then its truly worthwhile having the first half of classic :)
---
Phase 1 needs to be the longest. The 1-60 journey alone is going to take plenty of people months to finish - ignore the people you see on this sub planning to take time off work, use the optimal leveling routes, etc. Those people are not a reflection of the population at large and Blizzard should not be working around those people. Rushing the phases is the worst thing they can do, it leaves so many people completely in the dust.
---
You need to postpone phase 2 as long as is reasonably possible because Dire Maul shakes up the BiS tables and suddenly MC runs are no longer a concern for a chunk of players. 
---
There's already a concern that having the Honor system out so far before BWL will mean that a small group of players will be decked out in crazy PVP gear before BWL even hits - that's true, but to rank so far with no battlegrounds would be crazy. This is where your plan falls apart. If you introduce Battlegrounds before BWL you make it way, way easier to rank up and you're incentivising people to rank like crazy and already be overgeared for BWL when it launches. Plenty of Rank 11 gear is better than BWL boss loot. This is bad.
---
There's your problem right there!
---
leveling a warrior to 60 and doing onyxia prequest took me less than 3 weeks on my first ever vanilla character. I don't think it will take long for people to down Onyxia.
---
You're exactly the person I'll do my very best to avoid at all times playing Classic.
---
When i think about boomkin, i feel like blizzard intended them to use innervate on themselves. Sadly this spell does not belong to them anymore
---
You can't say "retail vanilla doesn't matter" and "we see this on private servers" in the same breath. They're both irrelevant. Classic is going to be a different beast. Speeding the content up is just as bad, if not worse. It rewards only the hardcore and leaves the mid-range players in the dust. There's *plenty* to do in phase 1 of Classic WoW.
---
So summon yourself?
---
and then re-run with crystals to the green-blue pylon
---
I think that city placement is very good as an Alliance. You have a Theramor in the middle of the Kalimdor with easy access via Menethil Harbor from IF, Ironforge is in the middle of the Eastern Kingdoms near Blackrock, So you have easy access to the South of Kalimdor via Theramor, to the Northern Kalimdor via Darnassus, to the Southern EK via Stormwind with quick travel to the ratchet via BB and the only annoying spot to go for you are the Plaguelands.
---
SOME people will watch guides, powerlevel as fast as possible.  The majority will not, some people will take weeks or even months to level.  Some will play retail and fit in a bit of classic around that.
---
Blizzard are making the game for everyone, not just for you and your accelerated timescale.  And thank fuck for that, because your version of the game would probably be dead in a year.  Bro.
---
I thought it said WaffleHand when I just glanced at it instead of Waffenhand
---
Everything is going to seem bigger when you’re walking around instead of flying on a 310% mount.
---
I’ll take sharing over competing for boars in durotar. It’s no fun taking 1h extra to reach lvl 6.
---
You are asking if ganking will be a problem and then answer your own post saying it won't? Next to no one on this subreddit claim that ganking is problem.
---
Regardless, that guide is pretty useless for what OP is asking for
---
But even then you have to wand to allow ur mp5 to kick in during fights.
---
My underatanding is that mp5 differs from spirit in that its benefit kicks in directly after u stop casting while spirit kicks after u spend 5 seconds without casting.
---
So either way you have to wand for 20-30 seconds every 60-90 seconds to avoid going oom in a long fight (5 minutes +)
---
*it is day 207. My quest log is full. I'm all out of Mana. And I still need one more crocolisk lung. I may not live to see the morning. Remember me for my nearly complete quest log*
---
[BRD questruns be like...](https://i.imgur.com/tmmpTCT.png)
---
Funny thing is, as a warlock in a dungeon you will still do decent damage even without gear.
---
I'm not telling you what YOUR vision should be.  I'm telling you what blizzard vision IS.  You don't have to like that vision if you don't want to but that's what it is.  'Make it as authentic as possible'.  New models is not authentic.  Period.  
---
Also, I don't think you'll be able to just patch something like this for classic lol.  I mean I'm sure you can, but the programs that use these things get you perma banned (like tmorph).  But if you do it you do it idc.
---
Second phase is still mc+ony, and these raids will be a current content. world bosses just add a bit extra thats all.
---
Also, average person doesn't level for 3 monthes. wtf is your data from? If some ppl might level that long, doesnt mean its average. 
---
From a private fresh server experience most ppl level in around 1 month maybe 2, and by this time server is already full flourishing with a ton of level 60s, active 60 life, a multiple guild, ton of raids etc. also leveling is ongoing process someone is always leveling. 
---
Once again 2nd phase is still mc+ony. Prolonging 1st phase for too long, will make ppl burned out. we've seen it on private servers once again when mc and ony lasts for too long, it isnt good for the game. and it doesnt feel good either.
---
i'm aswell thinking than 6 month is too long, 3-4 monthes would be ideal. 
---
i think i need to repeat it again, 2nd phase raid contentwise will still be mc+ony, it almost like two first phases. Most private servers starts with these world bosses already, its not a big of the deal really. not to mention only like couple of top guilds get affected by it and gonna kill these bosses. 95% of playerbase not get affected by it. and pve wise nothing gonna change from phase 1 to phase2. you still will be doing ony and mc.
---
Thanks for perfectly reflecting what I thought when I said cancer. It was not clear enough.
---
&gt; There's way more people from pservers and retail than people stuck in 2004 
---
There is a huge difference between pserver players and retail players.
---
Btw, I said "hardcore pservers players". Some pserver players are chill and not as hardcore as you are, and many retail players that play Classic will do it casually, either because they actually hate retail, or because they will play both games, and therefore not be hardcore in either one.
---
&gt; And a server doesn't need many people from pservers and retail to make it the dominating meta. 
---
Yeah yeah, we're gonna see that.
---
You're gonna need a lot more than just your own innervate to not go oom as a boomkin in classic. Their mana efficiency is almost comically bad.
---
100 hours if you speedrun it, likely closer to 200 hours for normal humans, specially on their first character.
---
Now plop in the 2-4-8 hour per day gaming sessions for normal humans and you realize how long it takes.
---
Then add that a dungeon can take 2 hours or even more of forming and running it, and you realize you are going to need some time.
---
Blue post: "We released classic last week. Why aren't people playing it yet? Oh that's right, we didn't tell you when it would release. Ready, set, go!"
---
Atleast someone gets it...
---
You have to keep in mind, wow is not that was it was back then! 
---
Sure classic will have a large population, but nothing in comparison to the numbers back in late vanilla/TBC.
---
For big gold sellers to exist, there has to be a demand and I am not so sure if there is one now.
---
I dont know dont hunter use crossbows over bows?
---
Like isint Pre raid BIS a crossbow? BWL gives crossbow. Rank 14 hunters want the cross bow. Naxx is Crossbow?
---
when was the last time you did the opening quests for them?
---
Nah pvp servers are dumb
---
I actually had the ouro gun (AQ) on a private server, where I had no luck to get the xbow. 
---
Just once there is the 3% hit scope from engineering, the hit rating for the hunter is losing some value.
---
Yeah, kind of understood that after I got it. I was young and didn't really think longer than "it's fun to play with friends!" running around doing shit that wasted so much time for so little :D
---
But we had fun!
---
DAY BY DAY, KICKING ALL THE WAY, IM NOT CAVING IN
---
According to you, for me it's the gameplay, RPG elements, community driven servers and guilds. I could play that with real life graphics or 64-bit graphics and still enjoy it just as much.
---
MC gives a decent normal bow tho right ?
---
The Q weapon from MC is a bow, which is probably the only bow between them, that is worth it.
---
SWP shouldn't be the method you use for refreshing shadow weaving, could push off another debuff. You should use rank 1 mind blast, even though it gives a little extra threat.
---
Spamming rank 1 SWP is a good way to start the fight, but if you push off sunders, or curse of elements, people gonna be mad at you.
---
Have you never raided before?
---
I mean this should be obvious if you have at any level...
---
Take off work.
---
Encase myself in a void that is separate from the outside world so I am not disrupted.
---
Spend an hour at the character creation screen deciding what class I want to play.
---
Yes, but everything else are xbows. Also, the berserking mechanic in classic isn't my favorite for sure.
---
No problem, with how dead that server became most of the player base missed that one as well....
---
And playing 14-16 hours every day for three weeks straight is something an extremely small minority of Classic players will do so it's not really something we have to worry about.
---
I mean honestly, if all your gear is red it's not about the first two or three tries and your group is either incredibly bad, underlvled or undergeared.
---
That said, I tanked ulda as pally recently, it got to the point where weapon, shield and shoulder broke, I had to hearth and come back (no lock) and still stuck with em and eventually we got it done, killed archaedas and I got my rockpounder
---
Ah silly me, just read shattrath and tbc and instantly called bs. 
---
Statement retracted, foot inserted into mouth.
---
I am glad that I will have a guild the moment I start lvling, so that I can do all the dungeons with competent people :D
---
Mp5 works whether you're casting or not. Mid cast, each 5 seconds you get the mana your Mp5 says, literally. No math required. Your spirit is the one with the 5 second rule to start working.
---
This is wrong. Arcane missles is 192 dps and 119 mps (mana per second) and frost bolt is 179 dps and 104 mps. This is without talents.
---
When you add in talents you get 189 dps and 88 mps. So this is 3 less dps (for now) and a whooping 15% less mps. Once you add in 50% higher crit damage (even with basic crit chance) you get higher dps. Also frost bolt is a binary spell and it slows (for non bosses) and scales better.
---
So no reason to do arcane missiles, except in some odd pvp situations.
---
Top guilds need some time to farm Tfury.
---
beta 25th may calling it
---
&gt; I wish somebody could explain to me why the first phase needs to be so long, because it doesn't seem to be good for anybody. 
---
A year of it would be long, 5-6 months would be perfect. I think you're stuck in a retail bubble or something where literally 90% of the community reaches max level in 2-3 days.. in classic I can put a bet down that not even a majority of players will reach 60 in the first phase. It will take a casual player \~3 months to reach 60 if the player does quests the second they go online and that won't even be the case because casuals enjoy doing other stuff rather than constantly leveling up when they finally have a few hours to play.
---
Also, when they finally reaches 60 they will need to gear up and farm for gold so they at least have enough gold for the most regular stuff they need to play the game. Which will take them several months aswell. Classic is not what retail is today, a majority of the community won't get everything in a matter of days or weeks which leads to them just logging in to raid, that's literally what a casual player doesn't do in WoW.
---
For the more hardcore players you have pservers to prove that they don't give two shits about what you basically calls the "content drought".
---
On the topic of PvP and level 60s ganking low levels in zones for honor in phase 2, tough luck. That's exactly the reason Blizzard have PvE realms.
---
3 weeks played or 3 weeks IRL?
---
I rate this flow chart a 4/10
---
Yeah this is the "I started in Pandaria" kind of person.
---
i'll be playing on a pve server too, I lost both of my hands in an accident and I tell alexa which keys to hit and I know on a pve server I'll still be above average
---
Keyboard turning was and is fine in a PvE environment. Always have been, always will be.
---
3 weeks IRL with a 9 to 5 job. Cant check but i probably had around 3.5 to 4 days played
---
Muricans lmao
---
You're literally doing me a favor then, thanks mate.
---
The majority of people will not be playing for 7+ hours a day for 20 days straight. I guarantee that's the minimum time you spent getting 60 in less than 3 weeks, if you did.
---
This is part of the reason I cant wait for classic. The grind!
---
I've seen the nets mentioned multiple times lately, but as far as I remember from the time I leveled my mage character in 2006, I was able to do BRD single aoe farming. I remember doing the Mara snake and turtle runs, then Western Planguelands undead farming and then moving to BRD before 60 and still farming it for gold after 60 for a few days. I doubt I would have been able to do that if there were nets at the time.
---
Considering Joana's record is just shy of 5 days as an experienced Hunter, no, you didn't do 1-60 as a fresh Warrior in 3.5-4 days played.
---
&gt;My dislike for Forsaken is that I don’t want to be objectively evil.
---
They are not. At least not in Classic. The Scourge is evil, but the Forsaken were unfortunate souls raised by the Lich King. They regained their free will, but everyone saw them as monsters, despite their minds being exactly as when they were alive. So at this moment they are no more evil than humans, as mentally they are humans. A common goal for Forsaken is to follow Sylvanas' goal, which is to defeat the Lich King - so they actually *fight* the evil.
---
There is a reason they are in the Horde all the way back in Vanilla - they are outcast, not welcome back to their original home. This is the core Horde fantasy. They are not evil, just not accepted.
---
You are right about trolls and arcane, though. This makes the choice easy in my eyes; you seem to really like all the aesthetics and movement of Forsaken and your only problem with them is not actually the case. You might consider reading Forsaken lore and you will quickly turn to not hate them. Just don't read further than WotLK (preferably just to vanilla, as that is what you will be playing). I wouldn't judge the vanilla race on what they did in BfA.
---
Orgasmic
---
Exactly this!
---
Dishonorable kills don't matter to people who are not going for high ranks. Naturally, during the ranking sessions they won't farm DH's but outside of that, DH's don't matter and it's all about the ganking joy. That being said: I'll absolutely play on PvE :D
---
So you will go Troll hunter for a bow you will use for a few months til u get the Crossbow /facepalm
---
Wow thats impressive for a first character, especially a warrior in vanilla. Ur an outlier tho. Most ppl are gonna take 6 to 10 days time played for their first 60 and thats not counting them rerolling.
---
I do believe there will be plenty of ppl who rush to 60 but i dont think it will be even 20% of the population that hits 60 in 3 weeks. I played wow up until mid lich king and even with all that experience, because of life, i am going to take about 2 months for my first 60. I do believe that is higher then most, i think most ppl will hit 60 somewhere between 1 month and 2 months though.
---
Overall i think a long phase 1 is good for the game. Even youtubers, the one who will be playing the most, agree because they know theres a fk ton to do at endgame launch already so no need to rush anything
---
I couldve easily spend more than 4 days its just a guess since i never checked. Spent most the time playing on the weekends. Probably 15+ hours per weekend
---
Yeah, I imagine all the people who love retail to be like people today suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome telling us...fuck me.
---
Lvl 33?
---
You're quite welcome, sir. Have fun with your other toxic tryhards going mad and blaming everyone else in the group when things go wrong, sounds fucking fun. Hopefully I wont meet too many of your kind out there :)
---
Wouldn't you think that world boss tanking is where the PvP grind is going to be in phase two?   It'll be a gankers paradise.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Yeah, my guess is it's more like double that. Which to the bulk of players who won't be able to play as often is going to add up to a lot of IRL time. You're right in that some players will have Ony down within 2 real life weeks but those people make up the 1%. For everyone else it'll take far far longer.
---
Midlevel players also level pretty fast nowdays. without speedruning or anything.
---
Retail vanilla pplayers in 2004 played for the first time WOW not only vanilla. 
---
Tell me what percentage of ppl play will play WOW for the first time now? i think like 5% maybe? (im not talking vanilla wow, but wow in general).
---
Ppl just know wow nowdays, and i don't mean vanilla wow, but just idea about the game what to do, quests system, binds, where to look info, etc  and so on. everything is much faster. 
---
Refering to retail vanilla numbers is unapplicable. but referring to private server numbers can actually give some real idea how it goes.
---
&gt;a few months
---
Clearly you don't have a clue how long it fucking takes to get ashre'thul.
---
I think your memory might be off. Joana, one of the most known speed-levelers takes about 4-5 days from 1-60 with a hunter, the fastest class for leveling. You can check out the website for more detailed information.
---
&gt; My fastest time was 4 days 20  hours and 49  minutes with a troll hunter 
---
Does not sound realistic for someone first starting to have played vanilla wow back then (with a warrior, one of the worst leveling classes) to out-level Joana with a Hunter, who's had years of practicing and mapping out the perfect routes.
---
I avoid all groups that play it **too safe**. Like what if we even do a bigger pull and die, let's have some fun. Ofc if we completely fail, we'll then just do safe pulls to finish dungeon.
---
Arcane missiles has a much higher chance to prove clear casting.
---
Respect for that, my dude. People leaving in the beginning/middle of an instance because of a few wipes, therefor wasting everyone else's time, are one of the biggest cancers in WoW, in my opinion. Hope I'll get to play with many players like you in Classic. :)
---
I like those odds!
---
I personally wouldnt mind it at all. Just wanted to pointout that onyxia prequest can be done in maybe 7-8 hours, that u naturally spend gearing up for raids
---
Thanks :)

Vanilla wow or pserver?
---
&gt;ashre'thul
---
I mean there is what 3-4 possible crossbows you will use during your journey in vanilla   
---
and 1 Bow.  
---
And for that 1 bow you will got Troll racial to get a super small dps boost for MC/BWL content
---
&gt;quest while dead
---
Beg pardon?
---
name one blizzlike pserver that is not like this
---
They are a very strong class, that's why you win duels.
---
Have you mastered it, in the way that Neilyo mastered it during TBC? I really doubt it. A good rogue can control 3 or more players in a PvP enviroment. Sure you can kill one really fast, but are you contributing to the team?
---
Ahh fair. Took me quite a bit longer when i did it back then but i was like 12 so xD
---
With 16 slots it might be ok we had a holy/shadow hybrid who would use low ranks to keep shadow weaving up for our MC clears
---
Silly tryhards :(
---
Okay, fair enough. So do I.
---
But have you ever demanded from your hobby's company that they put release dates on their stuff based on you personal life?
---
You guys are being unhealthy as hell about this all and you know it.
---
I remember tinkering with some weapon procs (Vanilla itemization was so wild early on) and trying to build around them.
---
I remember playing around with an "AOE" build centered around ["The Hand of Antu'sul" aka Mini Thunderfury](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9639/the-hand-of-antusul#dropped-by) which was built for prot pally or prot/fury warriors, and even do some lowbie dungeons on a Rogue.
---
You're gimping yourself by not rolling Gnome; they are the master race.
---
You shouldn't take it so seriously, carrying around all of that anger isn't healthy man. Move on, realize you can improve as a player and maybe people won't crawl down your throat for being so bad.
---
Days played would be 8 hours a day over the course of 3 weeks. So its less than 7 days played, by the time i hit 60 i only needed to clear UBRS and the ony prequest was done. Rest of the questchain was done before hitting 60
---
You mean you're not gonna have one char of each race/class combination during phase 1? Casual.
---
Yeah, we agree, conditions will not be the same. We have **no idea** how many people will be playing for the first time, no idea how many people will be private server players, how many play BFA, how many people will be returning veterans. I think the last one is going to be the biggest group - people who never cared about privates but would happily play an official Blizzard classic server.
---
Yes, people know the game better, but we're talking about time investments. I use Joana as an example because he's the fastest leveler and even he takes 116 hours at peak performance. Imagine how long it's going to take someone that's not trying to powerlevel. Now imagine that person can only play a few hours a night. It quickly adds up.
---
Using numbers from private servers is inapplicable also because it only shows data for **that** kind of player. Not returning veterans, not newbies, not retail players.
---
Very well done!  Thank you for your efforts!
---
No raid will use VE, it works only for priest party and there is a ton of debuffs more useful then that even with 16 debuff limit.
---
Thing with shadow priest he can be replaced with a shadow weaving holy priest. He casts a few shadow spells to get the debuff up and then just maintains it. You basically get a 90% healer instead of 50% dpser while having same shadow weaving debuff up. 
---
Also more benefits: easier to replace your shadow weaver (any priest can spec into it and needs no special gear, instead of having 1 guy who if he does not come you lose a good healer instead of it who also has even worse gear), less item competition (shadow gear is then all offspec and no whining from warlocks and mages about good items going to waste), shadow weaving stacks are faster (shadow priest will want regular spells instead of level 1 spells), no eating of improved shadow bolt (or a lot less anyway), no debuff slot on SW:P and no wasted healing gear (this depends if debuff cap is 8 on start or not).
---
No, you are confusing beta testing with alpha testing. I guess it is confusing since many new games have started to skip alpha. There are several reasons for this and actually a discussion in the gaming community about whether it is okay to label it "beta" when it clearly is not at that stage yet.
---
An actual beta test is exactly meant for testing performance, bugs, crashes etc. A beta test should already have all the features. While if one turns out to be a *really* big problem there might be feature changes, but in general the idea is to have the game in place and then test if it runs as it should.
---
So when you say "bug testing could be useful, but you don't need a beta for that" it is actually exactly what the beta is for.
---
The question is what you intend to do in phase 1.
---
If you want to log on for hours each day and speed-level to 60, downing raid bosses as quickly as you can, the long end of a several month phase might content-starve you.
---
If you can't or won't log on for several hours each day, you will need time to reach 60. If you want to enjoy the levelling experience, you might even level more than one class, maybe not all the way to 60 but still for quite some time. You might even level characters on both factions in order to experience more of the world.
---
If you do it this way, you will have plenty to do in phase 1. If you rush it and run out of content, there's always BfA to hop over to with more content for you until the next wave rolls around. 
---
But you do understand that the faster Blizzard rolls out waves, the faster the vanilla timeline will be over, right?
---
Ye i went full tryhard and read up on a lot of guides. So even though its first time it was quick
---
Out of curiosity, do NPCs benefit from racial abilities (the passive ones like the orc stun resistance)
---
Just play dwarf. You will have no problems.
---
Pserver are outliers, because you have a metric fuckton of nolifers on such servers. When ND launched they had 8 full fletched 24/7 premades running on alliance side alone. On my server back in the day the horde side had *one* premade.
---
In Classic the amount of adults with responsbilities per server will be much higher than scandinavians and brits on welfare and chinese and russians playing as a job that you have en masse on pservers.
---
If you can play 2hours a day, 4 on weekends saturday + sunday, thats 16 hours a week, thats 15 weeks of leveling.
---
PvPers and neckbeards are already catered for by introducing incredibly powerful PvP gear. Just let the casuals get to 60 before phase 2 starts, so they can atleast fight 60 v 60 and not get farmed as level 48.
---
Haha going off topic, how petty. Guess we're done here.
---
Luckily I was 6 when classic came out, so I’m 21 now in college with tons of time on my hands :D
---
Gonna be grinding all summer long.
---
Awesome video. What server are you playing on?
---
Or you hit drain soul one extra time every 30 min? If you do low level content there is no way you will be blowing through your shards fast enough to run out of them that often, and if you do content where you will use this many shards that also means you are fighting level apropriate enemies where you can refill your shards.
---
Either way the trinket takes up a bagslot that you can just use to carry one additional shards. Its pointless to have the trinket.
---
Nah mate, sorry you're completely off base. Speeding up content is absolutely terrible and would shorten the life and ruin the integrity of the game. It will never happen, so i'm not worried one bit.
---
Sure, but the original point still stands, the vast majority of people are not going to have time to play 8 hours a day for 3 weeks, that's a huge amount for working adults. It's far more likely to be 4x or 5x times that amount and suddenly you're talking about 3, 4, 5 months before someone can even consider raiding.
---
Unless you plan to play in a hardcore guild Dwarf is fine.
---
All duplicates (1.3K)  have just been removed. Some people even managed to register up to 11 times. Registering duplicates isn't possible anymore.
---
Ahhhhhh those things that drop in dm all over the place.  Yes open world farming for those is ridiculous!
---
Not sure about Classic, but you are right that it was added later in Vanilla.
---
You do realize that we know for a fact that things like armor values in Classic is much lower than private servers right? And several mechanics such as how the C'Thun pull works has been beefed up to be harder. The only person crafting their own reality here is you.
---
Its just because pvp comes in p2. That a longer p1 will be better, more players will reach 60, meaning the FP and lowbie honor campers wont have so much to gank, and will restort to other areas. such as BRM, DM and such.
---
Ahh ya i didnt know about guides back then. Even this time i wont be using guides for my first character. Just wanna enjoy it xD
---
For the average mortal you still have a shitload to do on stage 1. 
---
Get to 60 takes on average 10days on pservers (that was the last information by pserver admins released for LHC and ND).
---
Farm 900gold (no rank 3) for mount.
---
Farm preRaid BiS
---
Get to know the raids again.
---
Everyone with a job will have plenty to do and will not even done with it once phase 2 launches.
---
You need a break from reddit bro, taking shit so seriously isn't healthy. Go check your blood pressure before you pass out mate.
---
Oooh, wow! Thank you! I'm not the most serious when it comes to end game stuff but I'm definitely looking to be part of the server community and looking to find some good friends! \*bookmarked!\*
---
I don't get it... All things in that image is correct!
---
I mean, u lose 3%hit wich is a big deal but alone it won't stop you from killing KT
---
Sounds great, how big deal is it not to have blessing of kings?
---
If you did more damage you wouldn’t die. Fix it dork.
---
Just go repair and come back
---
Well thats you but what about the other 39 people that too will have to be at 60. Most of this crowd are now adults with kids. So it will take much longer then back in the day when we had the free time to grind for hours on end.
---
I jizzed my pants
---
Why are you insinuating I'm angry in any way? You're the one sounding furious for me calling you out on being toxic and not wanting to play with you :þ
---
Now continue telling me I'm angry, waaaaah.
---
+weapon dmg &lt;3
---
Uhh the majority of the server will just be dinging 60 in the 4 month range.  The only people leaving will be people who cant handle the grind
---
Nah a full level if you do master linkens chain
---
Quest while dead?
---
Most if us are a bit older now. Depending on the day it launches I’ll probably grind it pretty hard - I think I may take a PTO day or two but honestly not sure if it’s worth it. Have some good beer or whiskey handy and probably get a bigass cold brew coffee in the AM. I don’t have kids yet but I do have a wife who will NOT be ignored ;)
---
But berserking makes up for it anyways.
---
But yeah, you shouldn't roll a troll hunter because of the bow spec. Unless it's twink. At least on 19s, a bow is BiS.
---
Warriors are the master class no?  The best do's and only viable tank.   Run a 40 man with lots of bandages.   Let's see who theaster race is.
---
You can tank in a dedicated and skillfull guild with a Dwarf Warrior. You can also be the Main *~~off~~tank*, it mostly depend on your ability rather than your race.
---
In any case, better chose your race according to your preferences... you will see your character a lot, if you don't like humans you won't enjoy the game as much as if you chose you're preferred race.
---
There is absolutely no way you did this. As the guy below said, Joana, one of the most prolific levellers in Vanilla had a record of just under 5 days. Warrior is one of the slowest classes to level as it is.
---
Well during tbc and wrath you could raidlog, and farm herbs before 30min raids. And never fall behind. But in Vanilla this is not the case. As a tank keeping 100% attendance, always full on consumes/enchants. Plus haveing a good amount of gold for repair cost and extra expenses. 3hrs a day might not cut it. Tanks grind gold slow, or you sell instance runs. No guild wants a tank that is poor and keeps slacking/begging for gold/consumes.
---
You know berserking exists right? The bow spec is just extra on top.
---
Semi hardcore = Casual
---
Ganking is only fun if the population is actually social, nowadays you ask for help and you get silence 9/10 times. I'm hoping that all the awesome roleplaying, social loving, barrel chested freedom fighters from old school mmos make their way back to classic and make world lvl and even ganking enjoyable again. I loved back in vanilla when I was getting ganked in STV and I called for help and 10 lvl 60's showed up ready to pound ass, but when your getting ganked and your faction doesnt give a fuck it's no fun.
---
You're doing this whole virtue signaling gatekeeping thing and its pretty sad. Get over yourself.
---
Diablo mobile will “save” them. Look at their financials.
---
Damn that's sad. I remember his announcement he had cancer and I thought I saw some new content months ago. Thanks. Sorry for my ignorance.
---
pvp is a different question, i was talking about the pve progression, as something that ppl afraid they gonna miss, if the first phase will be shorter. my point is they are not gonna miss it. and i think i showed why.
---
As for pvp, some private servers start the game with ranking already in place from day1. and its a much bigger servers than we can expect blizzard servers gonna be. and guess what? ppl level up and its more or less fine. it aint that bad as ppl paint it too be.
---
obviously im not saying its the same as without ranking, and you probably gonna get involved in pvp more, and be ganked  more.  but its not like its impossible to level or especially troublesome or anything along these lines. it just adds some extra spice thats all.
---
Also ppl overevaluate how many ppl even gonna actively go for the pvp ranks, care and actively rank up.
---
This is one of the best things you don’t get in retail. You have to do the 4 for the part of the story you are one, and then you get the next couple. Makes you feel like you have no agency, and if the opposite faction is swarming the area, it’s hard to do anything. Nothing feels as good as this
---
Must be my personality. For some reason i feel like i have 2 minmax. I cant just lean back and enjoy the ride
---
4 days of /played over 3 weeks is nearly 5h a day.
---
As a casual player with other activity than gaming I know that I won't even play 5h a week.
---
And no, you did not level to 60 in 4 days /played
---
It is hard to pass up on the geographical advantages of being Aliance in vanilla. Then you also got paladins! Hord may have their better racials I will keep my shorter travel times and paladins!
---
Ya many ppl are like that. I play games for fun tho not to be the best so i just relax xD
---
I respect your opinion. However, you clearly do not play Tauren.
---
kek
---
this killed me
---
So much alliance  gear is gay banana suits.
---
It just looks so awful.
---
Warrior being the slowest is incorrect imo. If u know how to hamstring kite lvling is easy and there is very little downtime between pulls
---
No.
---
Sadly this posts feel like empty promisses
---
It's also the shield from one of the hellfire quests, so untouched since early tbc at the latest.
---
I guess so. I just think that the hardcore players might get bored if they dont get more content. But i could be wrong. Personally i think i might get bored because of lack of PvE content
---
I agree to the point that Vanilla absolutely need more time Investment. However I stand behind the point that 3 hours a day is not casual and a lot more than you need in order to keep up.
---
General consensus that I've seen is that horde have it better while leveling. Dungeons aren't counted in that because they're generally ineffective for leveling.
---
Horde has better quests. Period.
---
In a truly balanced game, an ideal raid would have been made of 5 of each class for thr individual skills they bring to the table.  Instead, you have 10 warriors and 2 hunters and 2 druids in an ideal raid.
---
If this listing is any measure of faction split, there will be ~25% more Alliance than Horde.
---
Ye i guess so. But do you feel like you would be missing out if the hardcore players are 1 or 2 raids ahead of you in terms of progress?
---
I do level slowly because I like to explore the world, do dungeon, level my profession,...
---
Not everyone is focused on being 60 as fast as possible
---
I don't think it's too much of an issue. in a Raid with 39 other ppl theres most likely another paladin with kings. And BoW/BoM do their bit in 5-mans and ZG, surely many ppl would rather get BoK, but that was never an issue for me back then. Today u might get some shit on from some minmaxers tho :P I will most likely play my pally that way once again.
---
I think even with hamstring kiting it's still one of the slowest. I never said it was the slowest regardless.
---
For the spell latency almost every ui addon is able to do it, back in wrath I was using Xperl.
---
The gathering addon is called "Gatherer" if I remember correctly.
---
&lt;Tiny Dolls&gt;  Spanish (Semi-hardcore/Casual/Moderate, pick one!)

About US: I'm Fruitcake(Gsis), i managed various guilds through my career in official servers and all end up pretty well untill disband, my plan is play casually(But i want first lvl 60 in server) but with a good raiding/PVP experience and a friendly environment, in we support each other and act as adults, not kids, we all got family and responsibilities, play it safe.
---
https://discord.gg/farwZAz
---
Pretty sure that the hardcore players in vanilla all say that alliance have the better leveling route
---
Looks really great, would be nice if you can list more people per realm for example instead of going through 5 pages :). Could add an option somewhere on the page *Results per page* with a drop down to 50-100-150 etc, whatever value desired.
---
3 hours is more than the average player but it certainly is casual for end game. There is a massive difference in time commitment for a casual raider doing 3hrs a day vs a a hardcore raider going for server 1st.
---
My problem is how the berserking mechanic works on vanilla -&gt; lower hp = higher speed and I can't remember right now all encounters, but you rarely will be less hp during the start of a fight or next 30s.
---
Then... don't join one.
---
I used to play on Gurubashi and I remember when they opened free server transfers to Zuluhed. Me and a bunch of my friends decided to transfer there. 
---
I had fun, but it was definitely a dead server and remained so.
---
\&gt; Blizzard are making the game for everyone, not just for you and your accelerated timescale. And thank fuck for that, because your version of the game would probably be dead in a year. Bro. 
---
They did make that game, the game the extremely vocal speed running simplistic gaming minority wanted, its called Retail, and as you said... its dead.
---
Basically, a warrior don't have parts, but if I had to call it anything, I would say it's his knee.
---
Who was talking about server 1st? The world isnt binary divided in "people that go for server 1st" and "casuals". Thats like saying doing 12hrs pvp a day is casual because its not enough for r14.
---
Yes, all of your abilities do.  Some of them don't get much from spell power, but personally on my shaman, I get fire gear and use flametongue, flameshock, searing totem.  they all benifit from spellpower.  
---

---
Any good 40-something, old man, 'I played classic 16 hours a day in my 20's and progressed through AQ40' guilds?
---
Don't forget Desolace. I remember horde having significantly more quests there than alliance.
---
Did you watched the hour long bacisc of advanced shaman mechanics: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ) ? :)
---
FT gets stronger the faster weapon you have. They go through it in that video. But still take it with a grain of rocbiter as Classic may differ slightly.
---
Yeah he was level 62 when I opened, I think I remember playing the first day or so in BC before rolling a paladin to see what the other side was like.
---
We're not going to start recruiting until our lead group is at 60.
---
Dont hate on the warlord gear!
---
Why be sad, when you dont need the drops?
---
That's unlikely, meta usually move forwards not backwards
---
The game isn’t going to stay at phase 1 forever - still a relevant guide for anyone inquiring about gold grinding strategy/classes.
---
Why doesn't the community want Blizz to fix the mana inefficiency of these specs? Certainly it wouldn't be that catastrophic of a change.
---
That's a weird way to spell GLORIUS
---
Pretty sure that's the joke :p
---
I got lucky and we had it drop the first two Nef clears and I won the roll on the second. Then of course we didnt see another one for weeks and everyone hated me :D
---
Our group has found former guild mates using this website, it's awesome
---
It doesn't even have to be for server 1st, 3 hours a day for end game raiding isn't considered hard core, it's casual for this type of game.
---
Holy moly, which realm is that popular? :D
---
It's literally retail vanilla that's irrelevant. Classic is just going to be just another pserver launch.
---
Yes, but that's completely irrelevant to this conversation.
---
"It should be obvious!" is not a valid clarification to your nonsense.
---
What does a mage farm in stage 1?
---
I see, well im sure that things were done without BoK so they can do it too.
---
Tho i don't really understand whats the deal with dps meters especially in dungeons. After all its not a race, i mean sure it can be tidious after you run it trough 100 times, but at that point id say take a break and don't rub your anger to other players.
---
How is the healing gear for paladin then? Because i feel kinda bad if i should need cloth items from other healers, since i can use plate.
---
Yeah ele/resto. Grinded warlord before ever touching MC as enhancement then was full mana tide for most of my raiding days. After BWL got repetitive I went ele/resto to go back to pvp.
---
I guess some ppl are underestimating how long it will take for the vast majority to even reach 60, forgetting prequests and how long it takes to gear up since you need time to do dungeons (lfg, travel to dungeon and ofc clear it in low gear in the beginning takes away a lot of time) and still you need 39 more to do 1 Raid, clear it and its liek at least 40 need to get geared up through this raid again.  
---
yeah some ppl might be out of content sooner because they can invest more time, but I'd rather go a slower pace than a too fast one.  
---
Then again, we don't know how blizzard planned the phases.  They might as well just wait and see how it is going and release it how they think we are progressing.
---
Thanks! Do you mostly PvP or PvE?
---
a macro to equip/unequip your gear works for the start of the fight.
---
I really don't know. I wouldn't take off any extended amount of time, so the idea to take one day to play a ton, then fall back into a normal ~2 hour a day routine seems like it wouldn't help too much.
---
Depends what day the game gets released.
---
Debatably 3% with Classic, I know it’s 3% on pservers however, remember they’ve used an educated guess for most things
---
Nah they will struggle, i was on bronzbeard and all the raids even for alliance struggled a lot. 40 man raids is not as easy as it looks to orchestra perfection. When we were ready the alliance had one raid group that was half way into MC.
---
All of those kinds of players are seen in pservers, especially after the announcement of classic.
---
Both equally.  I usually play on PVP servers.
---
Still hunter
---
I'm in no rush. I'd rather them take their time and release it when they are ready. Some people however have demanding jobs that require you to book dates off months in advance, so I do understand their frustration. It's just an inconvenient fact for them and they want to vent. Such is life.
---
2021-07-16  that's summer right? And healthy.
---
Remember the bwl crossbow is quite a low drop and well usually only one a week if any. Might be using Rok for awhile
---
Wow. I've killed Nef almost every week on private servers for years now and I've only seen one drop. It went to a shadowpriest who then left the guild. And this was on Nost where the loot was bugged and he dropped an extra weapon. I've seen more complete thunderfuries being made than Lok'amirs...
---
ghost mushroom sneaky boi runs if herbalism
---
Liquid satisfaction
---
At this point you are just ranting and spouting nonsense. Have fun with that, I quit the main wow sub to not have to interact with your kind. (Yes, you are blocked)
---
Warrior Sword-Specc was ridiculous since a Procc could procc another Procc. :O
---
You know how I know you’re trolling...
---
If you have to hamstring kite, you’re not doing damage, and you’re low on health. The kills will take longer and you’ll have to eat and or bandage before next pull. 
---
Warriors are gear dependent, have no way to recover health, have no escape, and have to take 100% of the damage from mobs.
---
As everyone else has said, you are not remembering correctly lol
---
aaaaaaaaaa imma NUT
---
Play a couple of hours, take break to make food etc., repeat. Marathon gaming sessions without proper breaks is not good for me, I'm sure I'll even level faster with some breaks than without, in the long run I can play for way longer that way anyway.
---
**Hunter pets**
---
If a hunter learns a pet skill, does he also learn all lower ranks of that skill, or just that particular rank?
---
Waiting patiently :)
---
To be fair, upright orcs were always supposed to be a thing, they kinda derped up in vanilla and we ended up with peon hunches. But 15 years of peon hunch I can understand not wanting to change it. Good point with the bashing though, some of it is probably that
---
Did someone say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?!
---
Probably not close enough to give a date yet.
---
I'm mad jealous of teenagers that will be able to play all summer tbh
---
I mean that’s the point... to anyone who’s used theory crafting understands what I’m saying isn’t nonsense lol
---
Clearly didn't watch that :P I was wondering about the faster vs slower weapon thing! Maybe I'll pick up caster daggers then as they have spell power and more speed than 2H or 1H axes and maces.
---
You can't say phase two is just Mc and ony.   Sure it's not a raid, but dire maul comes out in phase two.   Why was it out in phase two?   Because it was catch up for MC and Ony.   So you are ignoring a large chunk of players that don't want to rush.   Alot of us haven't played this game in 12- 13 years, and I'd like to raid MC without world buffs or catch up gear.  I don't expect to take 4 months to level or anything absurd,  but look at how the games original progression, Rag took longer than any other boss to down.   Sure people didn't know the game that's why, not the difficulty.   The thing is, this is supposed to be classic wow.   Not classic pserver.
---
it'll def be a problem. for the allys in redridge that is
---
Refresh my memory, what hit % do other Hunter races require?
---
Every time I hear this "40-45g/h" PP runs from BRD I cannot help that this is the absolute peak they land at and simply project that they can easily sustain that level.
---
I'm well aware there are newbies on privates. I was in BFD run on Ely recently with a guy who'd never played before. 
---
By veterans I mean people playing WoW for the first time since they quit retail, so no, they are not on privates. And exactly how many BFA players do you think are bothering with privates? Not as many as will check out an official classic server they're already paying to access, that's for sure.
---
You're both fucking retarded.
---
&gt; Classic is just going to be just another pserver launch
---
Hahaha
---
Okay, I don't even know where to start with that one so I won't try. Don't be delusional
---
Dude hamstring kiting doesnt hurt ur dps. U will still attack whenever ur autoattack is ready. All it does is mitigate damage. If you disagree with this u need to check vid about it on youtube
---
this is so incredibly satisfying to look at
---
Exactly. People dont choose to be new or bad at the game. However you have the choice to stick to the group and follow through... even if it gets frustrating.
---
wow thanks a bunch for this!
---
potentially gms. its up to blizz
---
They've seriously buckled down on preventing model changes nowadays, to combat exploiters. There's still ways, I believe Azerothica found a way (NSFW if you google that, very NSFW). But its not easy, and you risk getting in trouble as WoW scans to make sure your installation is okay. But if you wanna do this, all the power to ya! Just make sure you do your research!
---
Just our of curiosity, which faction are you going to play?    Fingers crossed you say alliance.
---
Same, but my friend is Domino's.
---
lol
---
Is the Paladin farming method decent?
---
If it's delayed without having a set release date except for "summer", blizzard isn't gonna get as much shit as they would if they missed a set release date.       
---
So they won't give a date unless they are absolutely sure the  game is ready for it.
---
Welcome to the club!
---
3 hours a day for end game raiding isn't considered hard core, it's casual for this type of game. Getting through content at a leisurely pace is casual. 3 hrs a day isn't going get you through content before the next phase is released. You are going to be lucky to hit 60 before phase 2 drops.
---
It does not have a much higher chance to proc clear casting, this is a bug on private servers (fixed nowadays on most private servers).
---
Arcane missiles can proc clear casting only once you cast the spell, not during channeling. So you would expect to get 2x more clear casting procs from frostbolts because you cast 2 frostbolts for 1 arcane missile. 
---
So yeah its worse both damage and mana wise, even with 0 spell power.
---
Best idea ever!
---
I think I fall in between most people. People should expect to wipe if it's a progression raid, however many times it takes until officers are satisfied that everyone collectively just doesn't have what it takes, yet.
---
In a high-level dungeon, however, I don't feel like the obligation is there to stay past 3-5 wipes, as everyone ought to know by then how to assign symbols to MoBs, crowd-control with polymorph/sap/hibernate/shackle/etc., what aggro range generally is, and so on. 
---
If people are wiping more than that, either someone's pet is path'ing through aggro, one or more people are under-leveled for the zone and is trying to get away with swinging up, or a hybrid is trying to fill the role of tank or healer without a proper off-set, i.e. deep fury tanking in pure D.p.S. gear, deep feral healing in pure D.p.S. gear, etc.
---
Sometimes, *something* big is off, and it's just not in the cards that they're going to complete it. Depending on how blatant the mismanage is, I'll give it 3-5 goes before I disband.
---
Logic? They don't have a concrete release date yet. That's it. Far worse to give a date then delay it. Even *worse* to give a date then rush out a botched launch to meet it.
---
You are right about the hype.   However consider, if they set a date and can't meet it, the backlash would be huge.
---
Fuck you blizzard, I used ally vacation!
---
This was nothing but a cash grab to get people to play crappy retail!
---
Activision is killing wow!   Omg hire Nost!
---
And more that I can't even fathom.
---
My guess is they are waiting until they can deliver.
---
Yeah, I can get one brewing today I believe.
---
Thats very fair, I really hope they fix a few more animations, a lot of them need to have less bouncy runs. The female models are pretty good though, non bouncy animations for the most part. The facial expressions when you laugh or dance are the best part though
---
Well it surely is a race for some ;) but I'm with you. I can imagine there will be ppl wanting to argue that your not a good enough healer in that spec but pulling aggro and not CC'ing and stuff.  
---
Well, I didn't play pally (max lvl) on a pserver and can only talk about from what I remember. You will surely having a mix from all sorts, cloth, leather, mail, I even had it back then not knowing whats "bis". In 5 mans you're the only healer and in the Raid one was going for their tier sets anyway ;)
---
Because that's not the point of Classic.
---
Of course, its just that he said "They are releasing 8.2 raid on July 16th" and I had to point out that that is not confirmed information
---
Why do everyone always react to trolls? This guy is obviously throwing around a bad meme and wants down-votes. Ignore him you morons
---
Because then warriors/mages/rogues hardcore pserver players wouldn't DOMINATE the dps ranking sheets from 1k+ dps difference. And then they would all get depressed. And then they would leave the game and leave everyone in peace.
---
Oh wait, that's actually a pretty good scenario.
---
I level as enhancement and don't really focus on caster gear aside of a copy of gear with int/healing if running a dungeon as healer. For me it's safer to not cast to much elemental spells and just have that extra mana for selfheals. For end game pvp you will need burst - spell crit for ele build or crit for enhancement with a lucky wf proc. Plus engineering stuff. In pve elemental will start lagging behind due to nature damage.
---
Actual solutions:
---
\- Get to 60 within the presumably 4+ months of phase 1, not unrealistic for the majority of players
---
\- Don't play a PVP server if you don't want to get killed by other players
---
That's it.
---
You might be right, but he puts a lot of effort in it so it comes off as if he’s serious.
---
The seasonal dates are the same for everyone in the same hemisphere.  Summer ends in Sweden, just like it does everywhere else in the northern hemisphere, on September 23rd.  It doesn't matter what temperature it is outside.  Fall does not begin until September 23rd.
---
If you are of endless patience, and the kindest person on Earth, then:
---
* 40 Shards - healthstones for every member
---
* 1 Shard - Soulstone
---
* 3-5 Shard - Summon a few people ("since you are already there farming shards in front of MC so throw a summon ffs")
---
* 1 Shard - Summon pet
---
Then when everone is there and you gave them healthstones, you can get the fuck out of MC and farm a full bag of shards again.
---
This is why most locks just dont give a fuck and SS tanks, give HS to their friends and the tanks/healers, and that's it.
---
1) private server folks are mostly dedicated, experienced fans of classic WoW with at least some level of technical expertise. Dedicated experienced fans will most certainly be more skilled and knowledgeable and will undoubtably level more quickly than the average player base of classic.
---
2) private servers often have dynamic res pawns and buffed quest xp during high level ranges. Idk if the one you played on did, but many did. Some had drastic exp increases. This obviously affects how long it takes the average player to level.
---
3) the population caps on private servers are often 10k+. Combine this with the previous two points, on top of the fact that many private server players know BiS lists and attunement reqs, and you get fast, efficient, skilled groups that are able to draw on a much larger pool of high level characters. Vanilla WoW servers had 2.5k caps and classic will likely have the same.
---
For the record, I played classic WoW from 2005 until it ended, and never reached max level on a single character. I was 10, but there will be people just as unskilled as I was.
---
Thanks for linking this, super helpful!
---
Spriest seems to be the right choice here, if he goes lock both of you have a good synergy together, if he goes druid id still go spriest because having double heals isnt that good, and you can offheal with ur spriest while doing dmg.
---
BRD
---
Not possible due to Net mobs and healers
---
I actually love the new Tauren model a lot :( I understand that one though, it is very cartoony, mostly due to its overly-done facial expressions. It's not as bad if you consider them light-hearted, peaceful creatures, that fight when they must. But yes, I have to concede that the Tauren model is very much not for everyone
---
6-24 weeks of raiding. 2 to 4 months of molten core attendance. Depending on luck and loot council.
---
9%
---
oh wow thanks, i had a bunch of icons saved on my old computer but lost em all. and it was just way too time consuming to search for them all again so i didn't bother. this is great! thank you!
---
I mean I get why you're upset about this guys take, but at the same time it's really not that elitist of an opinion bro.. Like obviously you can be nice and say I'm leaving or whatever, but if people are wiping over and over in a leveling dungeon you likely don't have to worry about them later on down the road when trying to get into a guild or something. Thats the only point he's making..
---
Doesn't matter if you are 60. The fastest way for people to get honor will be camping flight paths and instance entrances as a group. Op doesn't sound like a care bear, he just wants more wpvp options.
---
Your server back in the day also had 10k population of China, EU, Us?
---
Seeing how many people behave with their whole "we dont trust blizzard" attitude, I could totally understand them not giving out anything before making absolutely aure they are able to follow through. So "they dont want to get burned at stake because that shit really wears you down" is one option.   
---
Another possibility is them eyeing a delay. They underestimated the amount of work to do and probably need to delay, but still hope they can make a summer release work.   
---
Third option I can think of: they want to do a stealth release. No info until mid July and suddenly "servers are up, what you waiting for?" I am not sure if Blizzard would do that, but it would make sense in order to keep server stability up.
---
Rogues and hunters might consider going engineer to vanish/feign death, see if the jumper cables work on a healer, and drop a repair bot to bolster morale.
---
A lot of people will have not played classic WoW in 12+ years though, which is pretty close to having never played. In fact, it may be somewhat worse because retail players are conditioned to the ease and mechanics of retail. Probably not once it starts to come back to them, but there may well be a period at the start where having experience playing another game will slow their learning curve as they have to unlearn their bad habits.
---
Oh my god, I thought I was the only one who did this. Ungoro was GREAT for it.
---
Well i would consider it Casual. 
---
I mean lets calulate how long it would take you to ding 60, with 3h/day = 21h/week. 21x10=210hrs/8-9days played. Playing 3hrs a day/7days a week it would take you 10+ weeks to get 60. 
---
And now, you dinged 60, you are going to gear yourself. Say 1st instance will take you 1hr. 15min search + 40 dng run. You can do 3-4 dungeons a day, with good speed and pulls.
---
its going to take you a long time to prebis yourself. And how much gold/consumes can you farm ?
---
I am Mantusks
---
But then you also have to remove dishonorable kills to make city raids viable in phase 2, which ain't happening.
---
Weird name. Sweet tabbard. Thanks for sharing!
---
I think flametongue benefit from 10% of your spell power.
---
&gt; By veterans I mean people playing WoW for the first time since they quit retail, so no, they are not on privates.
---
Yes we are. What the fuck are you talking about?
---
I see, thank you
---
ah this brought back great memories. loved his vids. rip
---
I will get my honor regardless. 
---
I have had some of the most fun taking over cities. I always thought it was a shame blizz never incentivized it.
---
You could easily be right. I have just cleared BWL this week though. MC and onyxia both seem easy. BWL on the other hand was quite a bit harder.
---
DAMMNNNN. Feels good
---
arent you scared of feeling bad while playing when you are eating/drinking poorly?
---
You could summon yourself if you're quick. Summon, hearth, repair, accept summon.
---
beer, wine, cigarettes, food on deliver, and fruit snacks so i dont die getting to 1-20 in one session
---
Get your buddy to go bear druid or warrior
---
I would love that so much, rebalanced classic would basically be my dream come true. I do understand why people don't want any changes though, it's a slippery slope and a lot of people just want to play the game exactly as they remember it.   
---
Personally I played retail vanilla and have been playing private servers off and on since 2010, so the nostalgic factor of a pure vanilla experience is long gone for me. Imagine a world in which every spec is viable and tier gear is actually worth using. Glorious!
---
In my opinion, people constantly skirmishing in level 50-60 areas is a much better feeling than turning capitals into a warzone. Especially for servers with unbalanced factions. Just imagine if the faction that outnumbers yours 5:1 is camping your capital 24/7. Mucho fun.
---
I suspect warlock will be six, priest is going to be pretty poped. Warlock won’t have many 60s in my opinion. Why do you think lock over priest?
---
Uhm, yes you do, unless you're in a guild with no leadership... This IS the go-to spec for Mages in MC/ONY/BWL... Try asking other mages and see what they say.
---
And yet despite all the memes behind every item being a hunter weapon
---
There was - and will be - a chance for a handful of those hunters wielding two-handed weapons actually knowing what they were - are going to be - doing.
---
Even the latest interview with Kevin Jordan (former class designer) confirmed that people who were addition of a melee dive during aimed shot rotation were following the intended design for the class.
---
Some EU countries have adopted laws about vague or missed release dates for game releases = Blizz adopted policy of giving no release date until they know they can make it.
---
I farmed it for a year and with no drop. FYI.
---
Go to work Tuesday to avoid possible launch issues, get home, set up GFuel IV drip, play until Sunday.
---
I remember "P MO FE" as "U LO SE".
---
No. He only learns that rank.
---
Hi, /u/jspark5
---
Sigh. This isn't fun anymore haha.
---
Faction leaders were on a 12 hour respawn iirc so it wouldn't be non stop
---
No one knows how BRD is going to work on classic. There is a good chance Mages will be able to solo in there again.
---
Exactly.. even IF ganking is a problem, there's already a solution (PvE servers) so this conversation has 0 reason.
---
You are basically reiterating the same argument again and again and again. "Others will be ahead" is not the definition of a casual. I dont see any point in further discussing with you, as you seem incapable of even understanding your own points.   
---
Good day sir
---
A real RPG
---
I can’t eat that stuff and stay awake anymore.  To keep up with leveling I have to eat some healthy foods and keep hydrated vs drinking beer and eating pizza, but I do prefer the latter
---
Fear Ward &gt; Tremor Totem  
---
Okay lets roll Alliance
---
What? Read it again. Veterans meaning the people who have not played WoW *at all* since they quit retail. That includes privates. I think you're underestimating how many people are going to return for an official Blizzard server where their character might not be deleted the next day because the server owner had a hissy fit, or hell, because Blizz themselves shut it down. Classic WoW isn't just going to be some new private server like you said below.
---
&gt; So your pserver experience is levelling to 30 or whatever? 
---
No. You know what an alt is, yeah?
---
If they go to the effort to replacate what most would consider an exploit, I would be surprised.
---
Everyone make sure to report all multi boxers
---
I forgot to add the wife pounding to my list, thought maybe that wouldnt go over well, but alas!  She said it was a necessity if I was going to game for a week
---
These guys are unbelievably beta cucks for giving it to him, it should go to a rogue but the other rogue beat him in the rolls so it should have went to the other rogue... jesus
---
That looks slick. And the legendary Whirlwind Axe. Very nice.
---
You seem to be extremely Horde biased.
---
In Ashenvale, Alliance also has Silverwing Outpost,  Maestra’s Post and Forest Song. They have more quests than you have on Horde.
---
Stonetalon is mostly a Horde zone so yes you probably have more.
---
STV is about equal really. Maybe Horde has slightly more.
---
Alliance also has Duskwood and Redridge, Wetlands. 
---
I’d say Alliance questing is still better than Horde.
---
But why leave? You as well farm players within the capital while waiting for respawn
---
Sure, just don't forget that raiding cities goes completely against getting honor in phase 2 because of DKs. Anyone near you starts killing bread vendors and suddenly you're screwed.
---
I love the 50-60 grind lol. Searing gorge, burning steppes, Ungoro, silithus, felwood, winterspring, azshara, badlands, WPL, EPL, running BRD..
---
Greetings, there is a severe flaw regarding guild Hate. It shows Soundless#8275 as an officer, which is not true. That guy was never an officer, just a trial who left long time ago, so whoever told you otherwise, lied like fuck. Please modify it asap. Many thanks.
---
2.5 is a great idea, I like the idea of a week or two of world PvP but it would get ugly real fast.
---
5+ months of phase one is ridiculously long.  It is fine if the people leveling slowly have access to DM, it was released with the intent of being a catch-up dungeon.
---
Wow. I don't even know what to say about the screaming, that's just ridiculous. All I can hear is, "I DESERVE THIS. YOU OWE THIS TO ME. ENTITLEMENT! WAAAAH!"
---
Yikes.
---
If you attack a capital, no one in the city will be flagged for pvp. Only people who choose to defend would be attackable.
---
This is how all old names look like nowadays. They nuked inactive accounts to free up names, same thing happened to my characters.
---
it does, but coifficient is very low. So you need a ton of spell power for it to be noticable.
---
Nightelf Druid !!
---
(or Nightelf hunter)
---
Do Hunter pets still chase rogues through vanish? #workingasintended
---
It's decent *for Paladins*. It doesn't compare to Warlock, Mage or Hunter.
---
We are 2 people, saying the same thing. And yet you are still defensive and wont accept both of our arguments.
---
Also dont forget to just do a little grinding. Great xp just from mobs. 
---
Save all the ungoro soil drops you get too. And savage fronds. You can use them for later quests!
---
Tauren hunter or Tauren shaman, but most nature lover is Druid
---
Regardless of pvp or pve server, it’s a non contested territory.
---
a stealth release would bust my balls but actually makes sense...
---
No, but you don't need previous ranks learned to teach a specific rank to your pet.
---
Warglaives ALWAYS went to the rogues.
---
Lol
---
&gt; I think you're underestimating how many people are going to return for an official Blizzard server where their character might not be deleted the next day because the server owner had a hissy fit, or hell, because Blizz themselves shut it down. Classic WoW isn't just going to be some new private server like you said below.
---
There just isn't any difference between someone who starts right now after 15 years on pserver and someone who starts right now (well, in a few months not literally right now) after 15 years on classic.
---
The amount of pvp chuds who put their identity into this game like you do amuses me.
---
I've managed to swerve around the wife being ignored problem by getting mine hyped as fuck to play herself :D
---
No kidding. He's saying the more casual players will just raid log for a few months. As s casual player 6 months sounds like it'll be about the time I'll hit 60 and just start working on pre raid stuff
---
Yeah sorry I really shouldve included that
---
Yup. I had Ravager just for the cool factor. I primarily played as a Hunter anyway, for the most part melee weapons were just for the buffs.
---
Dark Whelpling
---
Give them their time so they can get it refurbished correctly. I'd rather wait an extra month than them giving a set date and then releasing retail-like garbage. Just like the old days, when they released when they were ready, not on a set time.
---
It does hurt your dps it just doesn’t eliminate it. Low level warriors are rage starved. You won’t be taking as much damage, so you won’t be getting as much rage, and you’ll be using rage on your hamstring. White hits are a good portion of your damage but definitely not *all* of your damage.
---
That’s not even mentioning the fact that hamstring kiting relies on open world mob encounters. Good luck hamstring kiting a camp. You can’t aoe farm, you can’t kite at close to full dps (kiting always hurts dps), you have no pet, your damage strongly depends on gear, your survivability strongly depends on gear, the list goes on mate. Not only are warriors shitty levelers, but the best leveling class played by the most experienced leveler using an optimal route couldn’t get under 4 and a half days /played.
---
... What are you on about? How do you do 15 years of "classic" without being on a pserver? Do you mean 15 years playing retail? I'm not talking about those people. I'm talking about all the people who quit retail starting in WotLK/Cata and never looked back because the game turned to shit. That's a *lot* of people who might be interested in returning to the old game without dealing with a bad pserver.
---
Do you want to love nature or *love* nature?
---
If you grind (or earn something in one game) it won't apply to the other. Same issue. But we'll see where they come down on the WoW token question, since it hasn't bee separately addressed.
---
You can turn off world pvp now. If you leave it on you get 10% more xp. So it doesn't matter what server you're on.
---
For levelling I'm going to go Enhancement Tank. Just for levelling though since it's not really viable in end game, if not by functionality, atleast by the availability of players willing to play with you.   
---
Gonna go engineer for PvP ofc but I wont spec/gear for the standard WF or Ele builds and rather just theorycraft a FT-centric build. I don't care about being the absolute best with a rare WF one-shot and all that. I'd rather be a mediocre player with a unique playstyle.
---
Play PvE if you value your time and being able to control it.
---
You can still do plenty of pvp at 60 on PvE servers. Its just on your terms.
---
Thats only for preordering. Afaik you cant preorder Classic because its bundled within Retail. Therefore the law doesnt apply.
---
Silithis made me rage more than I'd like to admit. The spiders down south and their web from across the fucking map?! Such horse shit. Although, soloing the elite quest (where you kill that elite bug in the south) was an achievement that I'm proud of as an ele shaman.
---
Ye, Soundless wasn't in Hate very long. Caused some drama and left immediately after.
---
Raids on cities was by far my favorite part of the game! And it would be the perfect placeholder til bgs come out.
---
My Friends coming over to my house so we got a full 5 man group for a full week. This will be awesome
---
No. I don't, those are retail players and they play on pservers too. There is literally every kind of player on pserver and that's why you are full of shit when you claim to have pserver experience.
---
I wasn't talking about cata or wotlk players, but people who played retail vanilla 15 years ago and are now returning back to pservers are not any different from the people who played retail vanilla 15 years ago and are now returning back to classic.
---
This. someone wanted to go shaman so all of us said "welp, horde it is then broski's".
---
We're a chill group. Alliance really does have better cities and some amazing zones but gotta compromise.
---
It won't be as bad as you think. Most players will be busy farming prebis at that point. The popular grinding spots at 60 will be camped but its not the 10k population pservers have so overall it won't be as bad.
---
It is SHOCKING to me how often this happened to people. Who on earth even wants to play someone else's account when they can just recover it out from under you at any time??
---
My account was hacked when I was on a 5 month hiatus towards the end of Vanilla. Fortunately, I didn't have any negative consequences. Whoever did the hacking just farmed me like 500 gold on my main, then apparently went and levelled a gnome mage to 57... and then I recovered my account and his six months were wasted. He made a shitpot of characters on random realms and levelled them up to like 15-16 before rolling something else. Just crazy people used to do that stuff!!
---
Shape-shiftign also blows off more your mana pool, which puts you at a dis-advantage.
---
Are you people seriously believing that nonsense?
---
Oh it's that guy I hate.
---
Just make them use the weapons. Imagine a bear with a greatsword or a cat wielding a staff. Itd be strange, but fun!
---
[deleted]
---
Play PvP if you value your time and being able to control it.
---
You can still do plenty of pve at 60 on PvP servers. Its just on your terms.
---
Depends, I find that a lot of leveling warlocks are hot garbage cause they try to dot everything even though it's alive for 12 seconds total
---
these icons are pure art. love it to bits
---
Log-in, try to get my names reserved. Log-out, come back 5-7 days later.
---
Well there is a tiny damage loss. But u dont generate a lot of rage from taking damage at low lvls. So kiting barely reduces ur dps, but it greatly reduces downtime inbetween pulls. Also u dont have to fight several mobs very often and when u do u can usually group up with others. Ill figure out my played time when iget home. But from what i can tell both paladin and rogues seem slower to lvl than a warrior that knows how to kite
---
You should actually try to get all the spell power to get huuuge crits with arcane shot
---
All you have to do to rank is afk? You don’t have to participate?
---
I feel like it should say "this is" and not "that was". Back in vanilla noone I knew had any idea where to get all the quests in a zone before they started killing mobs and doing objectives. It was pretty rare to have gone to multiple quest hubs to pick all the quests for a zone up before starting them.
---
I feel like the place you really had the most quests to turn in at once was like the barrens. Hard to remember that far back though. 
---
It is a good feeling none the less, but I feel like that wasn't my vanilla, and it's more of a pserver/retail feeling.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
I just want to incentivize king killing. 
---
I don’t care what anyone here chooses to do. It’s just a fun option that would promote healthy honor exchanges... that would also be remembered for another 20 years
---
A bm hunter lupos can afk and let the pet kill.
---
Good suggestion. Working on that.
---
Great, you're talking about something completely different. The **veteran players** I am talking about are the people who have **not** been playing privates. There is a *huge* amount of players that have quit retail over the last 10 years that have never touched a private server. That huge amount of players is a potential player base for Classic WoW which *literally cannot exist on private servers* because I'm talking about people who would never choose to play a private server. It's really not hard to understand, I don't know why you're having such a hard time.
---
I'd go for a WL since you can park him somewhere  for summons or get the advantage of Soulstones etc.
---
Guess Hunter would be faster though, if you intend to invest into some Weapons/Eq as well
---
I'm leaning towards PvE at this point but I'm wondering if my concerns about them are valid or not.
---
Do a large amount of people still opt in for PvP on PvE at 60? Does the TM vs SS battle still happen?
---
Does overpopulation of a zone/area ever become a problem because you can't simply kill them and take their spot?
---
Is there a form of PvE griefing that I'm not aware of?
---
Do we get our ass kicked by ogres there too?
---
The other rouge rolled higher than him tho
---
Idk if its still possible but horde used to be able to say, "an al" and it would come out as "ha ha" on the alliance side. Not sure if it was orcish or not.
---
What will the Alliance do without bread?!
---
Then yeahs super shady
---
Been working on an album full of real life places that may have inspired various zones in Classic Azeroth. Would love suggestions, I've only been to the places in Utah. A photo doesn't really fully capture what a place feels like, so if someone has a place they've been that feels similar to a wow zone let me know! Some zones are missing as well could use some help with those too
---
If all you care about is professions, I'd go Hunter.  But Warlock would be a good option as well - fast leveling plus you have a summon alt.
---
I found Warlock easier than Hunter actually but YMMV. Having a good wand makes a huge difference in leveling and mana efficiency.
---
Rogue all the way.. They dont need specific gear to pickpocket farm.. also, theres autoloot in Classic, so thats gonna shave off minutes each dungeon run and exponentially increase gold per hour. Granted the droprates are similar to that of ... yo-ho servers.

Are you me?
---
You said that Shadow Priest was one of the strongest raiding specs. When top guilds are deciding to run 0 Shadow Priests, that seems to not be the case.
---
Crusader is definitely better for people who can use it than flat agility. Especially for people who know how to use cooldowns properly.
---
Well yeah, it would. Boomkin actually has extremely strong dps, which is rendered pretty much useless in raids due to mana usage. So just fix the mana issue and we good, right? Nope. Now you created a class that has equal damage but so much more utility and versatility than mages - why even bother with them? So you need to take away most of that stuff. And we are back to retail.
---
I don't know I've never been, but if you go tell me so I know to avoid it! Also there's more pictures if you keep scrolling!
---
Yeah, leveling alchemy at 60 by buying all mats at the AH, and then recovering some costs by selling some potions that get made (that will actually sell).
---
I know prices differ server to server, but relative costs remain pretty consistent (i.e peacebloom vs goldthorn etc).
---
I was just curious if someone had made a guide titled "most economical way to level alchemy".  Thanks.
---
Good luck doing this in phase 2
---
Already aware of that.
---
Yeah. Like I said. No one knows how it is going to work yet.
---
Classic wowhead is not a reliable source of data. That guide is based on guess work.
---
thank god reputations will matter in classic, people like you won't be poisoning the well for the rest of us.
---
Seen it a while back, too. I think he was abusing a pserver bug though
---
this is my first „i can‘t wait any longer!!!111“ post ... but i really need something to looking for to play even when it’s summer and i will be out with my girl at the beach and take a sunbath for our sexy bodies.
---
You should definitely play them. A lot of friends of mine really enjoyed the WC3 campaigns even if they never really got into doing ladders or anything with WC3, they're great. Blizzard took WC3 off of their store so you have to buy reforged though... and you get the old version in the meantime. I'd play it now instead of waiting because they apparently are retconning the campaign to shoehorn Retail WoW lore into it like those two audiences are totally interchangeable.
---
There is a big middle ground between 8hrs/day vs 3 hrs/day.
---
&gt; You think the playerbase of pservers is weird in some way when it's not. 
---
Keep editing your posts to add points later, sure. The private server player base *will not be the same* as the Classic player base. Privates are free. Many privates are multi-region. Some privates are P2W. Some privates aren't Blizzlike. **All** privates are not official. Yes, some people will play both. But to think the playerbase will be exactly the same is hilariously misguided.
---
I also plan on following Joanna's guide but also doing my profs and dungeons. Im not trying to speed run just trying to be more efficient.

My doubts about a summer release are mounting. When was the last time they mentioned a release date? I’d say the longer the amount of time since they’ve mentioned a date, the more uncertain the release is, and the higher the likelihood of a pushback. If they said Summer 19 back in 2017, a lot could have changed aince then to make them push it back. Maybe it’s certainly going to be pushed back, but they can’t say whether it’ll be an early 2020 or summer 2020 yet so they haven’t said.
---
Answering only exactly what was asked. Awesome :)

Cloth dresses tho

Pfui for ui mods is hand down one of the smoothest and most useful ui mods out there. Custom designs to choose from, xp/hour gold/hour gold gained/lost timer, and so much more. I'm PRAYING whoever made this ui on private servers makes it for retail. Anyone looking for a good customizable ui try pfui out
---
Let them take as long as they like but FFS, let them get it right!
---
Yes, there are people who chose not to play on pservers while waiting for classic. And by definition those kind of people you don't meet in pservers. Why does that matter at all? Are you believing in  some kind of correlation that people who are principally opposed to playing private servers are also people that are stuck in 2004?
---
That makes me instantly think the classic team is not doing a good job if that tool bag has something good to say about them.
---
Gets you barely half a level. :)
---
Assuming you are gonna do the same quests every time you level the order doesn’t make a difference as long as they aren’t grey. 
---
If a quest is yellow at 35 and green at 36 it still pushes you forward the exact same percentage of the total XP you need for 60
---
i wish i could reciprocate and find something about you amusing :(
---
Even at 100% HP it's a good enough racial. At the start of the fight you can unequip everything and then equip, you'll be at 50% or less depending on your gear.
---
I think most people define casual as someone who will not complete content before the next phase of content is released. If you only play 2-3hrs a day, you will be lucky to start MC before phase 2.
---
how do you solo an elite as ele?
---
Top guilds didn't run with 0 Spriests. When the utility and damage was realized they always had a spot. 
---
It IS one of the strongest raiding specs because they can effectively replace a healer while doing mid-high level DPS. I didn't say they were the strongest DPSers. I said I topped the meters of a Hakkar fight in ZG.
---
Look, you can choose to believe me or not I really don't care. OP comment on Spriests, I commented back, he asked for some advice, I gave it to him, that was that. The throngs of people who want to try and prove me wrong or say I'm lying are pathetic. If you want you can check out my characters. I was Giovani troll priest in vanilla on Hyjal and switched to pally in BC Sutekh, BE Paladin on Black Dragonflight when the free server transfers opened up.

Ungoro, shimmering flats, what are some other places like this?
---
I for one welcome our new phase 2 gank squad overlords!
---
&gt; Min/maxer will argue Druid tanks can't tank raids, but don't listen to them
---
No, Min/Maxers need druid tanks. SaladBakers even run druid tanks.
---
Beautiful... for a hordie
---
This is an amazing site! Out of only 25 Horde registrants for my old server one of them happened to be one of my best mates from back in the day. I seriously can't believe it.
---
You might be right about rogues but I would bet paladins are slower. I remember that the official strategy guides for WoW had leveling advice for rogues along the lines of “fight things lower level than you”
---
So the advantage of PvP servers is you get to gank people, the draw back of PvP servers is people get to  gank you.
---
If you like ganking role on a pvp servers, otherwise just role on a PvE servers BG's will be there for when you want PvP.
---
Do you want to be able to kill things? Hunter. Do you want to be able to kill things AND heal? Shaman. Do you want to run away really well and heal without a Rez? Druid

Here’s a vid from 2006.

https://youtu.be/6NPg20GdNxk?t=80
---
What is your definition of hard core? 2-3hrs a day won't let you hit 60, hit pre-raid gear, and clear MC before phase 2 is released.
---
everybody in retail seems to hate the bc leveling zones bc they're old and the story isn't up and in your face, but i love them tbh. i love collecting a shit load of quests in ghostlands, hellfire peninsula or zangarmarsh (so atmospheric!) and spending an hour doing them all to get that sweet sweet turn in feeling. can't wait to do this again in vanilla.
---
Druids or hunters
---
Druids if you want to roleplay one in tune with nature and wants to heal things and make plants.
---
Hunters if you wanna be friends with animals and maybe roleplay a protector of nature or something.
---
Shamans are more supernatural imo. Elementals dont feel as naturey to me compared to animal forms and animal pets.
---
Why does it matter? Because it's such a large group of people that it completely nullifies your claim that Classic will be exactly the same as a new private server. The two are mutually exclusive. Just think about how many people have quit WoW compared to how few have played privates. The crowd is going to be totally different.
---
I already said I was well aware that some private players are newbies, you can't gotcha me with something I already said I was aware of. And yes, I'm sure there *are* some people playing BFA as well as privates, you're right. But you're not telling me that that's going to be anywhere *near* the amount of people with a BFA subscription that will check out official Classic servers they're already paying for, right? Neither of us know that divide for sure, but *come on*.
---
Horde leveling is hands down easier. Horde at 60 is hands down logistically more of a pain in the ass
---
What a manchild.
---
This is why you shouldn’t raid with a streamer.*
---
Neither was that the point of "2007scape", but I argued against a stagnant OSRS before release and that opinion was met with backlash. I know that I'm not wrong here. People want classic but, for recent retail players, are missing the class fantasy of legion. A majority of the players on launch will come around to wanting classic classes viable across the board.
---
His party members are actually disgusting, so thirsty for half a second of validation. Absolute bunch of cucks. Soda is fine.
---
I love the spell power enhance shaman build. The only issue I found while playing one was that spell power didn’t modify totem damage until I think 1.11 or .12. Is this going to be an issue in classic wow. Because this is the class I want to play.
---
Only relevant differences matter. If server has both EU and US players rather than one or the other that will not somehow make players go back in time 15 years, so it's not a relevant difference...
---
It is the same as level 60s camping nessy in stv, except instead of ganking level 30's and 40's, they are ganking level 50s and 60s. Go into chat and get a group to fight back, or just run away.
---
In a way I agree, and in a way I don't.  I think if it's a group of people you haven't played with before you should play it too safe at the start.  Get everyone used to working together, see how everyone reacts to different things, get one or two bosses down, then when everyone starts to actually play as a team kick it in high gear and finish the run.
---
Utility comes at a price. To use your utility you have to actively reduce dps. Make their utility costs more intense so it's a risk vs reward scenario, and so they cant just lol offheal and top the dps git gud dps only classes
---
Two box while you level maybe?
---
Asmongold is an overconfident blowhard.
---
I think he is right
---
1. Classic has a slower and more methodical pace of gameplay. not the kind of streetfighter-asian mmo style games are made today. some like the slower pace more.   
---
2. Most classes are good for beginners, you spend time watching videos, learning your class and you play what you want.   
---
3. Horde raiding has more of a TPS race than Alliance. And a little diffrent playstyle in pvp. But in the end its both equal.   
---
4. My favorite zone is Unguro, i like the Ambience the quests, and the pvp for devilsaur.   
---
5. I dont think my "hype" will fit on a 1-10 scale. haha
---
Ha, I had a lot of fun on yohnbearpig. Too bad Warhammer Online wasn't better. I quit when we raided a city and it was garbage. I also think I talked more shit to &lt;Vigor&gt; than anyone on Order lol.
---
That was the third time I ended up on a server opposite of Nightmare Inc people. I rolled a gnome warrior on balnazaar and Xyshina at least was on horde (didn't play a ton, though). I'll have to friend you on here, I want to roll on a server with old familiar names on it
---
This is just ninja looting, with some idiot screaming in the corner as pretense. He clearly lost the roll, so the item was just stolen from the winner.
---
If Classic WoW is to have any "server community", people who steal gear like this need to be exiled from it. This is no different than any other ninja looter, childish whining aside.
---
I’m pleasantly surprise by this subreddit’s opinion of the whole streaming culture.
---
As a 26 yo guy, I find it extremely cringey to see how the “gaming community” evolved. We used to respect the most skilled players, and even then barely gave a fuck.
---
Now it’s like the guy that can shout the loudest gets the most views. And people seem to worship these idiots. Kind of ties in with the whole celebrity culture. Maybe I’m just disconnected from modern humanity, but I find this extremely disturbing. Worshiping false idols. Or maybe I’m reading into it too much.
---
Regardless, I’ll be avoiding these streamers like the bubonic plague.
---
Undead &gt; not playing wow &gt; every other race
---
Yep
---
I seriously doubt it will be as dire as you are suggesting. This won't be like private servers with 10,000 people online all the time, and every single person who wants to farm honor on the same server. You might have to play an alt for an hour or 2 if it gets as bad as you suggest, but it wont be going on all the time.
---
God I miss the old quest logs. Addons worked for a while but the new map and log that constantly closes and opens all tabs is so frustrating =\[
---
Pop your shit, burst like a mother, drop totems/frostshock, release your inner ghostwolf, run like a mother
---
Rinse and repeat
---
Who's talking about going back in time? The whole point of this ridiculous thread between us is that you think Classic will just be the same as a new private server and have the same crowd of people. I'm telling you you're out of your mind. Let's end this now because it's not going anywhere. Just remember this when Classic WoW gets significantly more players than any private server ever did, **because of the people who didn't play privates**, and why that means the player base is completely different to privates.
---
The meme is funny but kind of truth when I checked Pre-Raid BiS 1.12 Vanilla for all classes https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?sle=true# and saw that Hunter Bis only has 2 mail pieces and uses DW Dal'rend swords as melee weapons *shrughs*
---
Who the fuck is this inbred idiot?
---
No mp5 works even while casting. That's the whole point of the stat.
---
I did the math before trying it out in practice for myself and on a longer fight where mana potions + demonic runes weren't enough for me to not go oom I did more damage prioritizing mp5.
---
The best thing you can do is collect all the gear with both mp5 and spell damage on it. The PvP set has some great ones at rank 10 I believe.
---
I've been rather skeptical of Blizzard's ability to redeem themselves and make classic as good as it can be, but the last few months of updates have been amazing and I can't doubt them anymore.
---
Still, there are a few things I would still like clarified that have yet to be brought up.
---
How pservers are played has nothing to do with the fact that they are pservers but with the knowledge that is now available. That's why it's going to be like pservers and not like 2004 vanilla.
---
People keep saying hardcore player. Hardcore player just translates into a person who has no responsibility with nothing to do all day everyday except play wow every single day as it takes priority over literally everything in his or her life. 'Hardcore' players just need to realize that you are the minority. Most people aren't like you.
---
1.) I haven't played retail in a few expansions, so I can't answer this entirely. But when I was playing vanilla/TBC just had such a better feeling of accomplishment when you did something. Attuning for Onyxia was a grind, but it gave you something to work toward. BRD is a beast of a dungeon, but it's so freaking epic that when you finally smash that final boss you feel like you did something. When you equip that first purple you know you earned it. 
---
2.) Hunter is generally considered the easiest class to play. Honestly though, research a bit and play what sounds fun, not what sounds easy. You'll learn very quickly and be happier playing what's fun to you. In late classic/early TBC I really wanted to learn to tank, so I made a warrior. I stunk up the place for a while, but I learned and by the end of TBC I was able to main tank raids in our guild's alt runs, which was pretty sweet.
---
3.) I've always played horde. I wanted to play alliance this time around, but all my buds are playing horde again, so that's where I'll be. I think alliance has the best starting zone (the gnome/dwarf one) and their cities are better/better located. I can't speak to their questing/leveling though.
---
4.) My favorite zones are Tanaris and Winterspring. Feralas is pretty cool, too. I know Un'Goro is a favorite for a lot of people. The best 5 man is Blackrock Depths, hands down. 
---
5.) 10. Definitely ready to get back in. TBC was my favorite time in Wow, but vanilla was a close second.
---
Good joke bro
---
You make me feel so old and I'm not even 30 yet
---
so basically didnt play at all huh
---
So you actually don't follow the news around the game but shit talk others over the release date? Quality post.
---
Just a little hint: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-update/113138
---
alliance players are just more organized
---
Shamen or hunter.
---
Shaman is more about all elements.
---
only one spanish guild, it seems like there is not going to be a "Ragnaros-US" on classic
---
So STV actually was inspired by Vietnam!
---
Never once said it was going to be like 2004 Vanilla. Let's end it here, it's not going anywhere.
---
Be great to have something like this for all games, tbh.
---
Lol, for real. Half of these guilds will fall apart or merge with other guilds by the time they even step foot in a raid.
---
got that pally class quest hammer, noice
---
IMO Warlock is slightly faster 1-10 than Hunter, but Hunter is faster 10-35 and beyond.
---
Probably because he'll have literally all the time in the world to nolife it and an army of people to feed him gold and carry him.
---
He wants his gear to make up for any lack of ability or practised expertise, because that's pretty much what old vanilla was about.
---
For classic wow to actually be something great it will need to be able to allow a casual player to do OK because in vanilla the user-base was young with free time but now everyone has jobs and the nostalgia won't be able to make up for the grinds and the older, known, static content.
---
But if anyone dare suggests you make some things less tedious he'll be the first to fight it because tedium benefits him and hurts everyone else who can't nolife it
---
My one request from this sub is to get a Google doc of streamer realms at launch. That way I can reroll if needed before it's too late to avoid shit like this.
---
All of this, except I really enjoyed the old Plaguelands zones. I remember being legitimately anxious the first time I entered EP because it feels so gloomy due to the presence of the Scourge. Vanilla Stratholme and Scholomance are two of my favorite dungeons ever.
---
Ya as he said, Druid tank is very very good. I Druid tanked all dungeons inc Ubrs very easily in blues with a warden staff. 
---
Feral tanking bwl and beyond will need a competent guild. The threat is awesome with bear however having good healers/ dps to take advantage of the threat is optimal
---
You actually used Vendorstrike?
---
that was a cool vid thanks for posting
---
To put that in perspective, that's more than the population of New Zealand.
---
Huh? Earlier when I said this exact same comment without the reasoning you called me delusional.
---
Technically no, at least in AV. as long as you were physically in front of your computer they couldnt fault you for not participating. Was only an issue for people using an AFK bot
---
Same with mine. People seem to forget that there will be plenty of guilds to join once the game is, you know, actually out. And the fact that most of these guilds will fall apart, more than half of the people they're recruiting are going to leave before they hit 60 anyways.
---
Look at all those buffs.
---
If mana isn't an issue they can since healing would cause them to leave shadowform.
---
ROFLi wish there was a SS of that
---
Well.. I don't see the problem anyone is worried about. If you get ganked in a zone or on a typical flight point, change the zone or grind area. There are plenty of options in each level to choose from. I can't remember getting ganked in Vanilla and thought to myself: well that's it. No chance of playing the game now. - I always had several options or a plan b to level
---
Druid is the epitome of nature.
---
Shaman is more spiritual and element focused than nature itself.
---
no comments
---
well yeah, this screenshot is only about 2 years old and was taken on ely***m, so you're right :D
---
The biggest has 8,500 online people right now, even tho most of it are chineses but there are a lot of EU/NA people playing on it still. I won't say the name because its against the rules but feel free to PM me.
---
You know what is also frustrating? Seeing your mortal enemy stealing your black lotus, but being unable to stop them because they didn’t flag. Most people on PvE servers will not flag themselves. So if you enjoy PvP, you will hate being unable to fight the opposing faction. 
---
Yes getting ganked is annoying. But most the time it’s just a minor inconvenience. Rarely will you be camped. And if you are camped? You just move to another location and level elsewhere. Problem solved.
---
The world should feel alive and at war. PvE misses out on the true dangerous world feeing that Warcraft is all about. If you enjoy PVP at all, don’t ruin your experience by rolling on PvE.
---
I mainly played on PVE servers (med/low pop servers) back in vanilla and there was quite a bit of world PVP when leveling and at 60. I remember leveling in TM and it was nearly daily large scale battles ( so much that crappy computer at the time couldn't handle it) even after battlegrounds were released. There was always skirmishes in Silithus, plaguelands and Blackrock mountain areas as well as city raids going on at 60.
---
Yeah, but fuck the majority. Pleasing the majority is how you get retail. Having good ideas is how you got Vanilla.
---
Shaman or Druid. Both are all about having balance in the world: Shamans revere the elements and Druids revere nature.
---
There is a paladin trainer in Theramore also, you dont have to go by boat every time to train skills.
---
Teenager heading into classic with nothing but time. :)
---
Why the downvotes? The guy has a very valid point. I wonder if the downvoters ever played a spriest or are downvoting cause they saw others' downvotes. (I'd bet my money on the latter)
---
According to web this is from euro servers where it was already known were bindings were for
---
No
---
I called you delusional for saying these exact words: Classic is just going to be just another pserver launch. I even quoted your text so you were clear on exactly why I was calling you delusional. Never said it had anything to do with Classic being like 2004, no-one believes that. 
---
Seriously, let it go, you're just grasping now.
---
On the bright side, once the streamers hit 60, they’ll form guilds where the “toe-sucking” will be mostly contained. 
---
No matter what server you choose, there’s going to be a streamer and their followers. Just be thankful the loot trading rules were fixed for dungeons - you might have never gotten gear otherwise.
---
Exactly this. The hardcore pserver people might be at 60 super early but not everyone else. Your average casual player (read: most players) will spend a month or two just levelling up, never mind then looking at *raids*.
---
How are you guys recovering this, paying for a subscription?
---
Expensive morale boost. Better get me to at least revered in server rep.
---
In my opinion, any lore after WotLK isn’t canon. It became ridiculous.

 LFG - NA | Alliance | PVE
---
About me: Hi! I'm looking for a potential guild to join for WoW Classic. I found this reddit community and really like the vibe of the players here. So, I feel comfortable throwing this out there. 
---
I played WoW from 2005 to 2010. From Vanilla to WotLK. I leveled a Warlock and Shaman to level 80 and enjoyed playing pretty casually with friends. I did a lot of 10/20 man raiding in Vanilla and BC and eventually the 10 man raids from WotlK, but I also had some experience in the 40 man MC back in vanilla days.
---
My plan was to roll a Dwarf Priest (big shocker) or Human Pally since I really enjoy healing and enjoy the grind to 60 while eventually working towards bigger end game content and grinding some personal achievements (winterspring sabre, benediction, complete Tier sets, grind rep, learn every vanilla cooking recipie, etc..).
---
I'm looking for something casual, but I am open to getting into some meaty vanilla raiding since I haven't really been able to do a bunch of that back in Vanilla. I would most likely be available on Weekdays at 9-12pm PST and Weekends would probably vary depending on my plans.
---
Thanks for your time!
---
Hi, /u/GamebinoPlays
---
1) They're different games really. Retail is more streamlined and really great for  casual players. But has lost a lot of difficulty and more importantly the community aspect of the game. If you aren't playing with friends or an active guild it can be kinda isolating. Classic is community and server driven and requires you to talk to people and strategize a little bit to be more successful.
---
2) Hunter. But really listen to people when they say play what you want. Watch some class videos (anything by MadSeasonShow) and pick what looks fun. You can always reroll.
---
3) Alliance for aesthetics, questing, cities, leveling for me personally. But this is just personal preference.
---
4) Duskwood for me. And elwynn or Tirisfal for starting area. The creepy gloomy zones are so well done. Tirisfal is probably the best starter zone for ambiance and story. Best part about playing for the first time is seeing what you find great. You might love say thousand needles, but a lot of people don't. 
---
5) 10/10. On many levels I'm excited for this game. More than just a game for me. Hoping it brings me some joy of playing video games that I haven't felt since...well...vanilla.
---
I can't say the name of the most popular private server. But I will say my friend Dale's favorite cardinal direction is north
---
You can play for free until level 20 on any account in retail. This means you can login and view your character list as well.
---
I agree with you. I'm pretty disconnected myself, from false idol worship and strange pop culture/streamer culture. Just doesn't resonate with me.
---
Cross your fingers that they dont resist Earthbind and/or Frost Shock. I found ele to be great 40+ until about 56. Then mobs seem to have a good amount of NR.
---
Its not fun being pigeon holed into an item. As a tank I know for sure I will never go for this item again it's bice but eventually gets out done. As well I'll be going night elf warrior over human for world PvP and greater weapon variety.
---
I can totally relate to you. I am 27, active gamer (well, as active a father of 1yo with a full time job can be) and I just don't understand what's with this trend. Those guys are not exceptional in any way, as you mentioned they just shout. Recently I watched an Asmongold stream, I was like hey this guy has a lot of views, he must be clever. Dumb as a bag of rocks... and people love it. But that is fine, we need dumb peopel as well.
---
What a little bitch.
---
That is very much true. If you count XP from 1 to 60 instead of per level that would indeed not affect percentage rates then.
---
I have a gf and work 9 to 5. I play mainly during the weekends where i go all out. I am probably not the 1%. I just care about efficiency and enjoy minmaxing
---
&gt;Seeing your mortal enemy stealing your black lotus, but being unable to stop them because they didn’t flag
---
Pretty much this, resources on classic such as Black Lotus are very scarce, not being able to fight for it is a huge drawback imo. The atmosphere of being in dangerous really adds up to the game experience overall.
---
Before I didn't, but with your reply it seems it hit right in the feels, so now I'm not sure..
---
That Chapel in EPL is pretty sweet too, I forget the name.
---
Report them for what? Blizzard allow it.
---
As people have already answered, I just want to say... keep yourself clean for Classic! It's only 3 months away mate, you can do it.
---
See you twinking 29s 39s guys! having fun is the endgame
---
That's not very autistic of you.
---
Strawman.
---
I'm not talking about 13 years ago, I specifically said this was a recent realization/trend.
---
I'm not specifically trying to prove you wrong or say that you're lying, I'm just saying that the current top guilds are trending towards less Shadow Priests, not more.
---
I'm sure there will still be plenty of guilds running 1 Shadow Priest simply out of tradition, and even a bunch of guilds who will run multiples because they don't care about min/maxing as much.
---
But I don't think saying it's one of the strongest raid specs is a valid conclusion to make.
---
Go to r/wowservers, they have all that info there.
---
Defender of the Timbermaw. Grinded for countless hours getting to Exalted cause that trinket seemed like the coolest shit ever. A mini-healer in your pocket! How cool is that??

I did in fact get it and is was indeed cool and got a lot of comments, but practically it’s underwhelming.
---
If enough of us have a problem with it, they won’t allow it.
---
There are mature streamers out there too. Unfortunately they are drowned out by these idiot kids screaming for attention.

It’s not mostly chinese. It’s about 10-15% Chinese.

---
Oh yeah, the Un'Goro grind. Seeing all those quests completed, loved it!
---
^ haven’t played since TBC and I’m keeping it that way until classic (Re subbed once but regretted it and barley played)
---
What sorcery is this?? I actually mentioned it to my wife and she didn’t seem too keen. Maybe I should just get her to play a bit and see if she engages. She’s a big kingdom hearts fan. Not sure she would like the eternal grind aspect of WoW 🤔

There was a blue post not too long ago (maybe 3 weeks or so) that said something about enjoying a "Classic Summer".
---
I mean, it looks like it's still on track for now.
---
    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)
---
While wanting to relive past heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week raiding schedule.  
---
Off nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over rate of players.  
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.  
---
Leaders of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.  
---
**Raid nights will be:** 
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)  
---
    
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!
---
**Loot System:** 
---
    Loot Council
---
**Our Goal:** 
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.
---
**Requirements:** 
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)  
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)  
---
    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

I just threw up in my mouth.
---
The concept of not fighting over resources and having the whole world just be empty of conflict is itself pretty boring.
---
It's not 2005. Private servers have all kinds of people playing. They play the way they do because it's 2019, not because they are particularly more dedicated or experienced.
---
I'm afraid that's not how it  works my friend.
---
&gt; Its just on your terms.
---
It's really not on your terms, though. The only time you can pvp is if *other people* flag themselves. If you flag yourself it'll be other people initiating the fights and putting you at a disadvantage anyway.
---
Make some characters, bang away on one for a couple of hours.  Go to bed on time to get up for work.
---
Any tank is good play what you want if you want to play warrior to tank with. I plan on going Nelf, after being a total Chad min/maxer for many years i have realized I want more from my warrior then 10% rep and 5 weapon skill and getting pigeon holed into using swords/maces. I want the ability to rank and gank in the world and being Nelf will provide me the best opportunity to do so. If you want to be a big bearded brother with the ability to shove off poisons and bleeds then do it brother. If you are a good tank a guild will use you reguardless of your warriors race.
---
Some of these responses are just a whole new level of sad. 
---
I'm going to play like a normal person.
---
I think the actual reason you shouldn't roll on a streamers server is that the server will be over-/underpopulated based on whether the streamer still decides to play the game, and likely has high faction imbalance on top.
---
It's easy to avoid the streamer in your own groups because he will likely choose streamviewers to invite in the first place.
---

LOL WAIT. we’re to talking about CURRENT fucking raids. Jesus fucking Christ dude I thought this was obvious we were talking about Vanilla wow...

There's more to this hobbit than meets the eye.

Tauren shaman, orc shaman(orc redemption worships the very spirits of the world and wants to preserve natural order), nightelf druid.
---
Actually, it’s just a rare weapon
---
Streamers will propably use loot council this time and simply grab all the significant gear since they play the most. And you can´t even argue against this. Just be wary of guilds with lc and/or streamers, you pay a price for joining.

Not all are as informed as yourself mister, believe me.

Found the terrible player
---
To be fair, Night Elves were trolls before the Well changed them.
---
I am talking about Vanilla. I think I'm going to stop responding to you now, I don't think you're capable of participating in a rational discussion.
---
Charge on a warrior. I love that rushing head on and knocking someone over. In my head its much more realistic. Like a person rushing at someone in full armor and then slamming them to the ground with a stiff shoulder. Or a full pyroblast cast. Obviously not the most practical thing but the thought of summoning a giant flaming meatball and shooting it directly at someone. Probably obliterating them is sick.
---
I would greatly appreciate this because I have no idea who any of the streamers are
---
When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab em by the warglaive.
---
Yeah, then they ruined it by not being trolls any more. Do you think trolls would summon the Legion? No. Trolls would instantly crap themselves and run away from the legion. 
---
Also nightelves worship a deer fucker. So there is that.
---
1. More RPG elements. Content requires and gives room for socializing.
---
2. Good beginner classes are Mages, Warlocks, Hunters. Paladins are good too, but can be boring for most.
---
3. What I like about Classic WoW, is your faction choice has more impact and forces you to think about it. Unless you are new or don't care and just want to get into the game, that's cool too. You get a whole different questing experience 1-60, and one exclusive class per faction.
---
4. I like Duskwood, because I adore the spooky dark woods thing, with undead, vampires and werewolves, and zombies, and ummm ok I'll stop. 
---
5. 7. The classic team is doing great so far, but the game still is quite a while away in my opinion, and there's still things I want to see mentioned and addressed. If they do really well, I hope potential TBC and maybe even WotLK servers are able to have healthy populations and also be a good thing.
---
Everyone goes OOM in vanilla
---
Its not toxic tryharding to not want to spend your entire days playtime wiping through a dungeon with trash tier players.. Come one dude.
---
See, thats why i like to mix it up. Play it with friends and if theyre doing something else sneak in and do it yourself. WoW is great for that.
---
Yes the struggle i had was exactly this. I'll be faster with an Hunter but i'll get more benefit from Warlock. Hard choice
---
&gt;For your troll problem, while they are more primitive in culture, they aren't that dumb
---
They ruled nearly the entirety of Azeroth for thousands of years, fighting against the insectoid by themselves and holding them at bay - the same civilization that took the horde and alliance together to beat back. They also went against the Mogu and other powerful races and were never beaten.
---
&gt;He wants his gear to make up for any lack of ability or practised expertise, because that's pretty much what old vanilla was about.
---
aka he wants to play vanilla
---
&gt;For classic wow to actually be something great it will need to be able to allow a casual player to do OK because in vanilla the user-base was young with free time but now everyone has jobs and the nostalgia won't be able to make up for the grinds and the older, known, static content.
---
aka change the entire game because I have the delusion of being a lot better than I actually am and I DESERVE to be able to kill people who are both better and put more effort into the game
---
what do you even want anyways? more of the patented blizzard forced 50% win rate? do you want total rock/paper/scissors game play so you're able to win more of the time?
---
&gt;But if anyone dare suggests you make some things less tedious he'll be the first to fight it because tedium benefits him and hurts everyone else who can't nolife it
---
people don't like that i want to entirely change their game, reeeeeeeeeeee
---
Goretusk livers. Ive been farming them off and on since day 1.
---
Ive collected 3 so far, but the quest needs 12. Back in late december 2004 i hit level 22 and all of the goretusks are now grey. Im still level 22.
---
For the love of Mankrik, someone please do this
---
"Some people are just trash and not worth spending time with." do you seriously not see how incredibly fucking toxic that is? I've been playing since forever, and encountered this type hundreds of times, I'm sorry I don't feel like playing with tryhards with mindsets like that. And it's not just "my fantasy utopia" where every is nice to each other, you literally just have to stop being a fucking asshole in dungeons when things aren't going too well.
---
&gt;  Who were the humans of Lordaeron? For the most part they were racist, slave-owning, self-serving, arrogant assholes. 
---
People tend to forget this about the Alliance. It's a major part of the Warcraft lore - who or what is good/evil. If you play through Thrall's story in WC3, all of them really, you see how fucked the Alliance really is. And they kept it up well into WoW. They tried to enslave the Pandaren at the start of MoP and use them as front line fodder.
---
What kind of wizardry did you use?
---
Titan Bar was pretty popular back in the day.
---
Bagnon?
---
I completely agree with your viewpoint. The "culture" of obsession over celebrities has infected gaming just as much as other entertainment mediums. This is one of my main concerns when selecting a realm at launch. My hope is that they release a realm list and the more popular streamers declare their realms publicly so I can avoid them.
---
Just turned 50 by handing in Un‘Goro quests, can‘t wait for more!
---
I know right? How dare he share his short lived experience of the game? And how dare he be on this subreddit to take part of the nostalgia? This subreddit is only reserved for the true hardcore vanilla players that devoted their entire free time to the game, right?
---
/s
---
Warlock is better if you enchant the dagger with +30 spl power
---
Who the hell knows. I did the math and I tried it out for myself. If the fight is longer than ~90 seconds (which a lot of them are, especially when you don't have world buffs) you're losing DPS from not stacking mp5 on every single piece of gear. Doesn't matter how much spell damage you have, you won't be able to make up for the time you spend wanding or casting rank 1 spells.
---
if someone starts from SW or Org they can reach gnomer in a comparable time.  ratchet to booty bay is prob faster than flying/tram to IF and running.  but if the teleporter wasnt an option then horde would never run gnomer since the next closest town is kargath or hammerfall.
---
I don't think it was discovered during retail vanilla. You're doing almost same damage while taking like 50% less damage, that's faster leveling than taking 100% damage and more downtime.
---
Thank you for the response.
---
So for example, mages will do pretty good since they're "magic dps in T3"? I'm thinking about playing Pally as a main and having a mage alt.
---
Did timewalking change in BFA? Last time I played a timewalking dungeon it was still the same brainless difficulty level but in an old dungeon.
---
You mean the good ol trick with the Skinning Knife? Is that SP so op for levelling tho?
---
Nobody owe you hours of their time. If the group is bad and it will take too long to clear the dungeon then dont expect me to stick around. I can put my time to better use.
---
Great video, thanks a ton!
---
imagine being so soft, so fragile that you get that easily offended
---
what a pathetic generation
---
Glad we could be of service :)
---
even with 30sp hunter is way faster than warlock. But like fab said, warlock utlity is amazing to have on a 35.
---
Bagnon/OneBag, threat meters, autoselljunk if it's available in classic would be killer, mail, AH, hover stat compare, gatherer... Yeah, quite a lot.
---
Imagine thinking you can show up to a team game and be as bad as you please and think people owe it to you to carry you through the dungeon.
---
like I said and I'll say it again if youenchant +30 spl power warlock is better than hunter
---
Idk how making all specs fun so people can get into their own vibe while playing is a shit idea saved for retail, but ok.
---
Still hoping to see someone from my old guild show up one day :’(
---
&gt;Yeah, then they ruined it by not being trolls any more. Do you think trolls would summon the Legion? No. Trolls would instantly crap themselves and run away from the legion.
---
What?
---
WoW was fun? Who knew
---
I'm sorry I don't share that mindset with you where if you suck at the game, then you're a "trash tier player". A large amount of the people I enjoy playing the most with suck at the game.
---
&gt; Maybe I’m just disconnected from modern humanity, but I find this extremely disturbing. Worshiping false idols. Or maybe I’m reading into it too much.
---
You are disconnected, but you're not reading enough into it. This phenomenon isn't limited to gaming, and it isn't new. It's been around forever, in all facets of society: Barnum made his riches through hollow spectacle, the sciences are mostly run by people who can secure the most funding with flashy demos and good writing, and I don't need to say much about "news" media or politics (and not just modern politics).
---
It's not that all of humanity is doomed, and that nothing of actual substance dvsf gets any attention, but a good amount of attention *does* always go to the loudest voice, or the biggest spectacle. Same reason people always slow down to gawk at a car crash, but almost never perform CPR on a stranger. It's nothing new, though; we're just seeing it more, and at a new level, with our newfound ability to communicate instantly.
---
When the dark trolls bathed in the well of eternity and were contacted by the legion years later they were still a small empire compared to the troll empires, gurubashi was expanding into nightelf territory, then queen Azshara contacted the legion and well, gurubashi empire couldn't withstand their empire being drowned in the ocean and split in half.
---
It's still a shitty thing to do, if you ask me. But you do you.
---
There are a lot of really chill streamers. Twitch gives streamers a breakdown of their audience ages and I believe Sodapoppin revealed his average was like 13-15. There are plenty of streamers with audiences primarily in the 21-25 range. 
---
The reason the younger audiences get more viewers is because kids have more time to watch Twitch.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
2 - 3 hours a day won't get you anywhere.
---
So like a normal day then?
---
&gt;everybody in retail seems to hate the bc leveling zones bc they're old and the story isn't up and in your face
---
To be fair, the story not being very present in BC was a criticism I had even back in the day playing it. At that point in the game, if you weren't one of the players doing raid content you had no idea what was going on with the overall storyline. It just wasn't accessible to people who weren't making a second job out of the game.
---
You will have to wait a big, streamers have a huge incentive to avoid revealing their server name. Likely you will be waiting until the name is leaked a couple hours in.
---
Came to post this. Well done.
---
As a Warlock, the BiS wand from Gandling in Scholomance; Bonecreeper Stylus.  I must have run Scholo about 30-40 times, never seeing it drop.  Then, when it does drop, the damn priest wins the roll.  The worst part was that priest waasn't even lvl 60 yet, and also won a roll earlier in the dungeon for Cainwyns Amulet -an epic necklace that dropped, .  Still never got it.
---
It sounds like sunk cost fallacy keeps him logging into BFA, but what pulled him in the first place was the fact at one point WoW was an MMORPG that required socializing and basic levels of communication to build relations with.
---
Imma go purist myself except for like KTM and Omnicc I think
---
Well for me personally...
---
1. I like PvP better because there is a lot of "gadgets" i.e. trinkets, consumables, profession items and even quest items that you can use to kind of alter the gameplay so it doesn't always feel the same (if that makes any sense). And I like that classes are more complex and yet feels more complete - there are these kinda small things such as having to buy ammo for your ranged weapon and some classes need reagents to use certain spells etc...
---
I'm not really role playing type of person but something I like about classic is that you can actually tell by appearance when an item is epic or legendary. Nowadays all equipment are super shiny with flashy/rotating animations that doesn't even look "warcraft-ish" to me, like its just too much (same goes for mounts...). I like that in classic it actually feels fucking epic when you equip an epic item.
---
2. I'd say rogue or mage - some would probably disagree, but these classes got the highest skill cap so even if you are absolute garbage at the game you should still be able to do decent with these classes.
---
3. Always been horde because Undead is master race, but i'm honestly thinking of going ally this time.
---
4. Silverpine Forest always gave me the creeps as a kid, but one thing I like about it is the village just outside shadowfang keep. At night the citizen of the village will turn into werewolves (worgens) which I think is pretty cool/creepy :p
---
5. About 6 or 7. I've played pservers so the feel of playing classic isnt so old to me.
---
I had a head start to be fair - she's a gamer herself, she'd just never played WoW. I emphasised the fact we'd be drinking and listening to music and playing together and that helped, plus she loves my old vanilla war stories. I have absolutely no clue how you'd go about convincing a non-gamer about it. Sorry!
---
Totem Timers
---
PvP kill list / tracker
---
Item set swapper (many names for this, but the basic concept)
---
Look at sunken temple, BlackRock depths, and the BlackRock spire then look at new dungeons. They don't compare.
---
Replied above :D
---
nothing against the guy i don't hate him like most people in here but he has a very punchable face, i don't know why lol
---
I was assigned to PvE - I had plenty of World PvP moments and lead some awesome fights around world objectives. 
---
That being said I did miss out on a lot of wPvP I would have otherwise engaged in. Honestly not sure what that did for me, but I can’t bash PvE servers. I think your individual server matters more.
---
For me, leveling to 60 on a PVP realm in the first few weeks will be a hilarious adventure I will be sad to miss. But the reality will be that in hundreds of hours of playtime that follow, I'll want to be able to AFK on a road without coming back to a corpse. 
---
I do have the option of leveling on a PVP server first and going PVE afterward, but I want as much of a head start on raiding as I can get. So my choice is made.
---
Horde has slightly better levelling experience and dungeons layout there's no doubt about it. Then you arrive at 60 tho. And having Fear Ward, Human weapon skill and Paladins is way better imho.
---
One breed of those spiders took a nasty chunk of your hp if you needed to engage them in melee. Always had to heal my druid after 1 fight with them.
---
Dreadmist helm for me.  A mage rolled for it the only time I saw it drop in vanilla and before cats launched I tried soloing it a lot but never saw it drop.
---
Never finished the tier 0.5 quest because of it.
---
i definitely agree that the overall story isn't readily apparent and for the smaller-scale stories you need to read quest text, which i think is (part of) what makes bc seem so outdated and bad to those players? and i guess i can see that tbh, because reading quest text isn't AS important now when you have a bunch of voice acting and cinematics to tell you what's up, so that could be jarring
---
Calling people toxic while insisting players HAVE to spend hours of their precious gaming time boosting bads who cant be bothered to learn even the basics of the game through dungeons.
---
Pretty clear you are the toxic one here.
---
*laughs in energy*
---
I have had multiple people tell me I’m reported literally every day for the past year. People really love whispering me about how I’m going to get banned, but for some darn reason I have never received a ban! 
---
ask yourself who would blizzard side with, the handful of angry nerds or the guy that’s literally paying for 40 accounts.
---
Agree. The most effective way to quest is to (beyond geography concerns) do green then yellow quests. You should avoid doing orange and red quests.
---
If you always finish all your green and yellow quests (and you know where all the quests are—or at least most) you will never run out and never need to grind 1-60. If however you start doing orange and red quests you will run out. As the xp from orange and red will boost you to a level where the greens are grey and the now green yellows won’t give enough xp to get you to a point where the quests above the initial oranges and reds are now yellow.
---
Basically don’t skip quests, do lower level quests first an$ you won’t have to grind
---
Not everyone has sensitive stomachs/weak willed bodies.
---
Bring on the fast food and pizza.
---
We won't be getting prepatch lupps though
---
Its abit harder. I tried it out when it was TBC. As long as you end up with people who actually remember the tacts or people with M+12 gear its as easy and frustrating as any other BfA content. Its when you end up with people who are freshly dinged and only remembers bits of the tacts it starts getting fun really. If you end up with 12 year olds, they are too bad and Will leave on their own within minutes. You'll eventually have a full group of players who's been in WoW since the beginning. Atleast thats my experience..
---
I don't even hate streamers, but I gotta say that screaming was obnoxious af. I'd give the loot to someone else on principle. Screaming down mic like that should get you nothing.
---
Yeah I know right. Sharding makes leveling easier as I don’t have to compete with myself for tags.
---
Yes they're free to use providing proper credit (a link to this page) is provided along with your work.
---
I definitely didn’t qualify that statement *drinks,shadowmelds*
---
The only trolls I like have tusks, not keyboards.
---
I made a text/gif tutorial on how I did this over here:
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=70
---
Okay, but that's variable. You never know where people are when making a dungeon group, so you don't know the travel time. But let's say Horde starts from Orgrimmar and Alliance starts from Ironforge, then Alliance is faster.
---
I'm pretty sure Alliance also respawn at Ratchet, since Ratchet is a neutral town. And yes Horde does have more dungeons in close vicinity, but Gnomeregan isn't one of them. 
---
Then again Alliance has like two extra zones in Duskwood and Redridge, both with some decent elite quests you need to group up for.
---
It's useless without charges.
---
Baron's mount had such low drop rate that people started speculating you need to pass special requirements for it to have chance to drop. One that I remember was that everyone in the party needed to be exalted with Argent Dawn.
---
Uh it’s just a stat stick without the on use and there are plenty of better weapons at higher levels with better stats.
---
Uh, no, you're supposed to farm a lot of them and use them constantly. The entire reason is the on-use charges otherwise it's totally useless.
---
And unbind backpedalling, that shit will get you killed more often than not in densely packed instances. I would know...
---
Yeah that's what I thought. Thanks!
---
Does hunter need to be in a specific spec to utilize nightfall properly?
---
The idea that you can't change anything about vanilla and have it be a better experience is really undeveloped and lazy
---
Funny how any suggestions of balancing classes better so the shit specs are at least somewhat viable gets met with the "purist" response that "changing it wouldn't make it vanilla", yet we're going to be playing the patch version that has all the class revamps anyway.
---
I find it interesting that you think gear imbalance means they are "better and put more effort into the game"
---
No, it simply means they don't have time for the grind. That's why there will be plenty of full tier two and high ranked pvpers that aren't actually that good: they don't need to be. And reducing that crotch doesn't make for a worse game
---
I have the whole summer to nerd out before my next job so I have everything planned out. Meal prepping, hitting the gym before release. I'm telling everyone I'm on vacation. No-life to 60 and try to clear MC with a server first guild in the second week.
---
For me the choice is simple. Throwing unlimited hadoukens, or endlessly throwing devil horn handsigns.
---
Troll. The obvious, and correct, answer of a cultured man
---
Because that’s exactly what blizzard has been trying to do since cata and as you can see, it didnt really work out.
---
Sadly they will allow it because one person is paying for 40 subs/month. It's still allowed in retail.
---
Come to Alliance, we have Dwarves, better alcohol, ladies that won't burn your eyes at looking (mostly), bubble-hearth, and party members that are made of flesh and blood!
---
Sign up to kill a greenskin today!
---
Gonna go ahead and say the people managing to cause multiple wipes are the cancer. Dungeons in Vanilla are not hard despite people loving to exaggerate. I’ll take the competent people every day.
---
Okay, but I don't think they would crap their pants and run. They were already fighting wars for thousands of years against Old Gods and their spawn. And the Mogu.
---
yeh thats fair, redridge and dusk are def great zones and provide a ton of good quests for teens and 20s
---
Your paying for 40 accounts and calling others angry nerds... retired? Living off mommy’s nips?
---
No its not toxic at all. I just have enough self respect not to waste my time accomplishing nothing. I am more than willing to help inexperienced players and stay through some wipes. But when the group gets to the point that everyone is fully red and have to go repair then we left the area of reasonable patience long ago.
---
I have been around the game long enought to know that some players will just never get good at it or even have any interest in improving themselves as a player. Nobody is under any obligation to carry these players and it's incredibly toxic to think I owe people anything when they keep wiping the group over and over like obviously was the case in the original post.
---
&gt; Does the TM vs SS battle still happen?
---
Yes, but probably moreso in early Classic than late Classic.
---
On my PVE server in vanilla, the place for Alliance to go was Crossroads. We'd go there and start killing guards and attract attention from Orgrimmar pretty quickly. That was in the days when we were all still leveling. I'm not sure how much of that was happening by the time we were closing in on BC release. 
---
To be clear, you're probably not going to consistently see anything on the scale of PVP servers. But occasionally, if you instigate enough and the time is right, you can get a crazy, memorable battle.
---
Yeah I agree, I'm sure there will be people doing /who on servers to stream snipe and figure it out. Will take a week or so to get a good chunk of streamers on a list but will be a useful tool in the long run.
---
Higher proc rate than vanilla?
---
You "Nostalgia" people just never let go of that terrible argument, do you? Jesus christ
---
I love this! Thank you for making this.

I'd say Westfall is pretty much [Kansas](https://www.google.com/search?q=kansas&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcl4Sz99ThAhVLRqwKHfBcDYAQ_AUIECgD&amp;biw=1408&amp;bih=667#imgrc=C1Ai497I730ZBM:) right?
---
Hardcore guilds are striving for the server firsts, semi-hardcore guilds are not, but high attendance, all consumables and meta builds are required, casual guilds usually raid once or twice per week and pay less attention to meta. I have no idea what semi-casual means though xD
---
I’ve always played horde and really want to play Alliance time time around, but my friends refuse to play Alliance.
---
I’m sad inside.

Yes I am. I too am a nerd but I’m not a angry one lellys
---
23 year old uni student with a lot of money.
---
So money &gt; our experience ?
---
For threat generation, glancing blows are probably a bigger deal.
---
Yes, if you wiped ten times in an easy leveling dungeon then players absolutely have every right to leave the group. You strike me as a really entitled person who think people owe you their time for no reason.
---
There have been so many lengthy discussions about that topic. It just doesnt work.
---
How did it focus on mmo aspects more? In random dungs my party members might as well be npcs. I don't care about them. We will most likely never see each other. Same goes to world activities, bgs raid finder and pug raids on normal. 
---
Social aspects begin in the very end where you actually need to work with people you're playing with like high m+, mythic and ranked arenas. 
---
It's not mmo anymore. It's a coop with large groups.
---
What argument is that?
---
I have to confess that whenever I go to start a new alt, I skip quest text now. I never did in Vanilla, and I never skipped it while leveling the new area for the first time at start of expac, but when it's not my first time through an area I just sort of want to get on with thing and speed to max level. I suppose the "the game doesn't really start until max level" mindset is a bigger issue now than it was back then.
---
I'm not trying to take up for asmongold in any type of way but the pure amount of game knowledge and things he's achieved in wow are miles farther than anyone else has gotten. He's not "dumb as a bag of rocks" he's actually I pretty smart individual but has to put on an act on his stream to get the consistent viewers he has.
---
Their solution was to remove distinct advantages and homogenized what utilities each class could access. It is not so insurmountable to retain individuality and provide viability. I think your pessimism is getting in the way of practicality here bud. I'm not happy with retail either, but I see classic a chance for them to get it right. Just like oldschool runescape, has for the most part.
---
&gt; The idea that you can't change anything about vanilla and have it be a better experience is really undeveloped and lazy
---
Never stated, just don't have any interest in your personal vision. 
---
&gt;Funny how any suggestions of balancing classes better
---
ctrl f'd and nothing, seems like you're projecting
---
&gt;I find it interesting that you think gear imbalance means they are "better and put more effort into the game"
---
also never stated, are you even trying or is this a joke?
---
&gt;No, it simply means they had time for the grind. That's why there will be plenty of full tier two and high ranked pvpers that aren't actually that good: they don't need to be. And reducing that crutch doesn't make for a worse game, player skill matter more will make vanilla better
---
i could pretend i'd love to hear about how you'd not only make bwl/honor ranking difficult enough to prevent all of the people who "aren't actually that good" while simultaneously trying to reconcile your view point that the casual player deserves to be more competitive but honestly, i'm not 
---
sounds like vanilla just isn't a game you're interested in and that's entirely okay
---
Someone who plays a lot. How do you know how long phase1 is? I guess that gives you 1-2 months to level 60. By that point several guilds will have MC on farm (2-3 hours of raiding per week). I guess you can use the remaining 17 hours to get some AQ consumables ready.
---
I always wanted Dark Edge of Insanity off C’thun on mine for the amazing pvp proc but never got the chance to steal it from a melee
---
Tbf there are actual reasons why they might have given the loot to Soda over the other guy. He might be the better Rogue, he might be more reliable (as in, turns up to raids), he might have been with the guild longer (he might even be a founding member?), he might be particularly loyal to the guild (a lot of players jump ship once they get loot). We don't know. I think it's unfair to jump to conclusions without proper context.
---
Having said that, if they're just going to loot council the glaive to Soda why did they bother rolling in the first place?
---
Mommy’s nips doing you good.
---
Finding it funny how your completely reasonable post gets downvoted by the horde of idiots who think they are the center of the universe and that everyone else owe it to them to spend their time carrying their asses.
---
Generation entitlement.
---
My plan is to have 35s at every crafting profession. Use one to find the next
---
The one thing that bothers me about this is the fact you cant do shit about players from your faction stealing your nodes.
---
people like to hate on it, but I mean... it's better than Doombringer, and a ton of players just weren't rocking many epics back in the day.
---
Have fun with the summon. In Vanilla, warlocks couldn't summon into an instance. So while you're getting your stuff repaired, the 'lock and a couple of helpers will have to run to the entrance.
---
What can I say, I was mesmerised by the purple
---
As soon as a server list comes out, I really hope he announces where he will be going. So I can stay far far away from that shit
---
Ashenvale will be dope.
---
Obviously not? That's why you need to farm dozens of them.
---
I can’t complain!
---
1. While I have my subjective reasons why Vanilla is far superior to BFA, it is of course subjective, so I'll let the other comments do the speaking for me.
---
2. I'm going to go on a limb and say that no classes are honestly TOO difficult to play, just some are harder to master. But anyone leveling to 60 will get a good feel for the subtle ways to improve their class. Don't stress over that. That being said, Warrior is more difficult to start due to everyone asking you to tank. It is however, very very rewarding when one gets good at tanking. Alliance get Paladins which make great leveling tanks, but I'd argue its even harder than Warrior. Easy healers to learn though.
---
3. Well, you asked for opinion so I can be as subjective as I want. ALLIANCE REPRESENT. We have Dwarves, making us the superior choice. THe Horde do have spooky skeletons, but they decide to rip all their armor to show their bones, which is just plain silly. (Basically decide what race you want to play first and foremost. Whichever faction you decide will feel like the right choice. I respect your decision regardless of your choice ~~even if its *wrong*.~~
---
4. Without knowing what sort of ambiance you're looking for its tricky. Dun Morogh, Loch Modan, and Blasted Lands are my three favorites, but I do also really appreciate Hillsbrad and Desolace.
---
5. TENOUTTATEN.
---
According to [Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/item=2243/hand-of-edward-the-odd) it's still at 57, but it has an ilvl of 58, maybe you mixed those two up!
---
Tidy up my room, dust the PC, make sure everything is in full working order. Buy a bunch of snacks and my drink of choice, probably a ^(*BOOMER INTENSIFIES*) Monster Ultra Zero. Maybe have a nice meal set up in a plate just in case.
---
Possibly take a few days off work, hopefully it coincides with a weekend for those +2 extra days.
---
I may try to connect some garden hose to my dick and route it to the toilet, it's not that far away and pissing will become automatic.
---
Imagine having so little respect for other people that you think they are toxic for not wanting to stay in a group that wipe over and over on really easy content.
---
It's your own damn responsibility to make sure you know the basics of the game before you enter a dungeon group with 4 other people. If the group keep asspulling, backpedaling into more groups and not able to handle basic mechanics causing wipes over and over, then ofc I am not going to stay.
---
And you are a fool to expect me to.
---
Don’t play classic. You will be benched by any competent raid leader for toxicity.
---
Wait, what do you mean? Can warlocks activate some other spell that will look like a summon, but do something else?
---
that's reasonable, tbh. i usually read it for That Immersion but there have been plenty of times when i skipped it, especially in a zone i know like the back of my hand (like durotar or eversong)
---
Also duskwood has some amazing questlines. I cant think of any horde quest I found comparable
---
Just play a Warlock, I have now decide dfor you.
---
It’s neat but I suggest putting all the real world examples on one side and the in game examples all on the other for consistency.
---
and your mana will be on half too...
---
mmo? it seems they are going a lot more single player wtih a little bit of co-op
---
I was like 13 so I didn't have CC or Paypal, so it was just gamecards and stuff.
---
Warlocks eat mages for breakfast and are widely considered one of the top dueling classes in the game. If you're concerned with survivability look into soul link PvP spec. In private server duel tournaments that spec is often outright banned because of how strong it is, even still the last 2 community tournaments have been won by warlocks.
---
First three responses, deflection. As for your last paragraph, when I refer to "casual" I only really talk about time spent. Because that was the problem with vanilla, how well you could play your class (even when most were pretty easy) was secondary to gear by a massive portion.
---
I fought many players in vanilla with full t2 and high rank gear but were really bad.
---
I want to play vanilla, but use the power of hindsight to improve it. It doesn't need to have to have the same problems "bcuz nostalgia, I don't care I'm putting in 8 hours a day don't fix anything"
---
Alliance storylines and overall designs of the early zones are better. However horde leveling is much more efficient and convenient.
---
One of the things I look forward to the most with Classic is cities other than SW and Ogrimmar being populated again. It’s just so depressing going into IF now and only seeing 10 other players max at peak play hours. But I have to go to IF because SW is so damned crowded the lag is through the roof. Went to the Exodar for the first time since WotLK came out last night and it was jarring how dead it was. I was there for an hour and never saw another player when last time I went there I could barely move it was so crowded.
---
Ok well then your comment makes no sense because vanilla is loved specifically because of viability and individuality from other classes. Trying to make them all fun in the same way leads to homogenized classes, like you said.
---
So what I think youre trying to say, is that, like osrs, the game should be developed on in such a way that vanilla mechanics are continued but some small imbalance issues are addressed. But you know what , that’s kind of exactly what TBC and wotlk did before cata started making them all the same.
---
So im kinda torn between blizzard making entirely new content while continuing vanilla esque game play or just rolling out tbc and wotlk in due time
---
Just .repair yourself, duh. /s
---
Gonna do the same, but skip gym on release Day.
---
Yeah pretty stupid question now that I think about. lol sorry
---
I have no idea who this is but he seems like a child
---
Yes. Fighting. The legion wouldn't be a fight it would be an infection you never get rid of. You can imprison old gods but the legion can bombard your ass with internals for a decade before coming to fight you.
---
&gt;  it's better than Doombringer
---
Really? A lv 58 BoP Epic is better than a lv 55 BoE Blue? Damn.
---
These are cool, not so sure about the Azshara one, its not really a green forest.
---
The issue I have with Rekdek's comment is the implication that everyone in the group except him is shit. I know from personal experience that it just takes 1 person to screw over a group and everyone else in that same group can be great. In fact, one of my fondest memories of Warcraft was a group I was in where the tank was complete and total shit. Eventually, the idiot tank left the group in disgust, another warrior in the group volunteered to try being the tank, and the 4 of us then proceeded to clear the instance, including the final boss, with no more deaths.
---
My favorite is that there are/were quests that were still undiscovered by players.  I believe it was based off a blue post, or interview.
---
I think it's kinda cool, in a way. I can't speak for everyone but for me, it's been a damn long time since I no-lifed a game like I used to. Too many responsibilities, not enough time, not enough inclination. I'm hella looking forward to going nuts on it for one weekend.
---
Sad? Yeah maybe. But I don't think there's anything wrong with taking one weekend out to splurge on the nerdiness again like the old times.
---
I think I did about 22 solo runs for the barman shanker, then after normalization had to get the crystal tipped stiletto because it's really annoying to have the barman bleed mess up gouges and blinds
---
Yes and it has always been allowed and almost never been a huge issue.
---
What exactly is the context of this?  They're clearly not playing TBC because of the item stats and the fact it says its usable by DK and Monk.  Are they just running old dungeons with level 70 twinks?
---
He cracked the code guys. Classic release will be in summer.
---
Delete your reddit. Stupid troll.
---
Its so clear, how did we not realize this
---
Why is this getting downvoted I'm agreeing with the guy wtf
---
"If you suck at the game to the point where the dungeon group wipe over and over you are not worth my time" Don't write a sentence like that when trying to defend me calling out toxic tryhards. I also don't know how you think that's hard to grasp.
---
1. Classic is an actual MMORPG. Retail is more like a single player game now. It's a difference between a sandbox game (classic) and a story driven rpg (retail)
---
2. Druid, Shaman, Paladin, Priest, Hunter, Warlock. Anything with a heal or pet. That being said, don't be afraid to try "harder" classes. The only one that is truly difficult to level is warrior.
---
3. I like Horde better, but my friends all play alliance. Pick the side with your friends - that's what matters most.
---
4. Westfall, Eastern Plaguelands, Silverpine Forest, Thousand Needles, Feralas, Burning Steppes. God man they are all really good!
---
5. My excitement goes up to 11
---
I recall using Gatherer, Decursive, Benecast (healing)
---
So I got hacked one time for a few days and I think a gold farmer used my character as a bank because when they recovered it for me, I had 8k extra gold and a bunch of valuable profession items that I didnt have before. It got me my first epic mount!
---
Alliance didnt have a lot there. Same with 1000x noodles and shimmering flats
---
Oh okay glad to know the community was able to come to such a verifiable and certain conclusion. I was out of the loop.
---
these are gold. must have been so fun \^\_\^
---
Don’t forget that back then getting to level 44 especially as a warrior took like 8-9 days played. Having to eat after every single mob 😩. I think I was a 55 with 12 days played when bc came out.
---
You don't ding 60 and instantly have MC on farm. Are you planning on joining a guild that already has the raid on farm or do you plan on doing progression with similar geared players? Because you need to hit lvl 60, get pre-raid gear, then do progression raiding. If you don't have all of phase 1 on farm by the time phase 2 drops, how can you be considered hardcore?
---
Love this response, lmao.
---
So servers back then had 2.5k people. x4 for 10k, this still is only 4premades. And on ND you had 8x10-15men premades and an awful lot of 5-8men premades, just grinding to rank10 or 11 more casually.
---
The amount of nolife rankers is just higher, because you have one vanilla pserver where everybody piles on and pservers are already rather niche. 
---
So obviously the amount of neckbeards is higher.
---
It’ll be sometime between summer 2019 and summer 2119. I can guarantee it!
---
Not gonna lie, despite it bringing no positives to the game, if I can leash Kazzak to Stormwind when classic is released I’m gonna be wildly disappointed.
---
Whoops, I  must have DC'd. Sorry about that...
---
Did you really create an account just to stalk me?
---
They can try*. Which is why Azeroth is an anomaly in the lore. The Legion has conquered thousands of worlds with little to no resistance, but have tried multiple times to invade Azeroth and have been thrown back every time. In the newest expansion even Sargeras has, seemingly, been defeated.
---
Would definitely piss a lot of the tryhards off though
---
&gt; the sciences are mostly run by people who can secure the most funding with flashy demos and good writing
---
What a bad copypasta.
---
alt+f4 is a classic
---
Corpses all around the ground inc.
---
Brb buying blizz stonks
---
I dont think thats the implication at all. In Classic you communicate. If one player keep screwing over the group then the logical choice is to remove that player from the group and replace him/her with someone else.
---
Obviously when you get to the point where you leave the group then trying to replace the bad apple has already failed, or the group is consistently too bad to be able to do the dungeon run. The only realistic option left at that point is to leave.
---
Why aren't you feeding your pet? :(
---
Hunter would be a couple hours faster than warlock. Warlock should be a bit faster than hunters 40+ once they get a mount but hunter usually wins the marathon to 60 because of aspect of the cheetah.
---
Project 70
---
I don't think the feedback from releasing the game over again will go over well. Like remastered games, but this time with literally nothing different. 
---
Also it makes sense to reference their past failure of retaining vanilla individuality as evidence that they would fail again. If anything doesn't that mean that they would have an outline of how to learn from this mistake?
---
Ahh, ok.  That makes sense.  Thanks.
---
My first 35 alt will be a 49 mage on an alt account. So I can have portals.
---
lol i also went looking for her and was sorely disappointed that i never found her
---
Yeah that one was tough I wanted to do it justice since its such a beautiful zone. I couldn't really find anything that fit so I just went with some random autumn picture... 😕
---
Pretty sure this won’t be possible. If it is thank fuck I’m rolling horde 😭
---
One weekend of binging is fine. I'm talking about changing one's sleep schedule, eating microwave food, drinking energy drinks, ignoring family, taking sick leave. 
---
People can do whatever they want, but I still find it ridiculous to be so self destructive over a video game.
---
Damn. Didn't your parents want to use their CC? I thought that was the primary reason why we have parents.
---
As i said, i only care to bring him to 35.
---
*FUNCTION OVER FORM*
---
Pardon me for having enough self respect to find a raid guild that have enough sense to remove people that refuse to improve at the game.
---
If you are find being in a guild that spend 4 hours clearing MC because they dont want to hurt the "feelings" of all the shit players that show up with no enchants and a level 45 pet to MC then go ahead. It's just not for me.
---
This is awesome, but for Westfall, doesn't the Amish aesthetic and their region fit better than Scotland?
---
Is there a level restriction to looting the chest in the stranglethorn arena?
---
That reminds me of my buddy up north, dale is his name I think?
---
I think the OP's point was that they had maybe 2 hours per night on weekdays to play and your suggestion may take up a chunk of that time that they would rather just be playing the game. Sounds like they would just prefer a PvE server for to avoid time wasting due to gankers and griefers.
---
Depends on time of day really.
---
Maybe you're missing my point. Getting DKs does nothing to influence anything but your current RP. I could get 1000 dks and go to zero rank and still take a bracket one spot if my honor was high enough for the week (not my RP, which is totally separate). You DONT clog a spot in BR1 by simply being GM or HWL, or any rank. If you're not PVPing you make 0 impact on the pool. The only impact you have is, as you mentioned, by entering a specific bracket. There's 0 reason to ever DK spam from a tactical standpoint.
---
If you're GM and spamming enough games to get BR1, you are indeed "clogging" a spot and should seek mental counsel. I've only ever seen Malakai do this and iirc it was just to make it to the addition of the Warhammer mace.
---
Your entire argument is flawed because of your timeline of leveling. 40 average people wont even get to 60 much less raid ready until 4ish months in. Give that another 2 months of grinding MC/Ony and then move onto a short phase 2. Phase 2 being MAYBE a month, probably 3 weeks.
---
I think you got that mixed up...
---
Give me TSM with modern features and let me prosper.
---
STOCKS ARE SHIT RELEASE CLASSIC NOW GO GO GO
---
Yeah was just giving some insight on the ol’ hunter vs warlock leveling debate aka hunter beats warlock to 60 because of the lead they gain before level 40 aka go hunter if that’s all you care about.
---
I can't fathom the mental illness to voluntarily view this stream regularly. Even worse, the idea of playing with this guy is mind-blowing.
---
Ok, I understand your point. The fact that he has to put an act and act like edgelord maybe does not resonate with me.  I remember the day when people were praised for their in game deeds, not how much they shout.
---
Why would it matter if you are on the same server? Just don’t join their guild.
---
If you enjoy your race/class, you'll put more effort and time into them. The slight advantage a human could give cant match up to the dedication you'll have playing that Dwarf you actually want to roll with.
---
Gotta stop by an ATM machine and get some cash
---
This is disgusting. And soda is an entitled brat.
---
&gt;People want classic but,   for recent retail players, are missing the class fantasy of legion
---
Classic wow is most definitely not being developed for retail players
---
Bartender and some version of weak auras.
---
Yea im right there with you being disconnected lets stay that way lol
---
Group of about 5-6 players here looking for a Classic Guild.
---
Here is what we are looking to join:
---
\- PVP Server
---
\- Horde
---
\- Raiding Guild
---
\- No tuesday raids
---
\- Raids ending at around 11
---
\- 2-3 nights a week would be nice
---
Feel free to message me if anyone has a guild that might fit something like this. If composition matters, we are still deciding on what classes to play and may change, we're not totally set on classes yet. If you would like any more info or have a guild that might this, please message me! Thanks!
---
Cool video. Changes are inevitable and I hope they tweak the druid talents (and some other things) when classic comes around
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
Nothing. Launch week and the week after is the worst time to waste PTO. I'll prolly slowly level, no-life that first weekend, slowly grind the second week, then with the 3rd week off, no life it. It's pretty easy to get to 20-25, about 30-35 hours played.
---
Swing timer... Yes please
---
The "it's just nostalgia, you'll realize it's not what it used to be, the content is stale, you're older now and it wont be as good, etc" argument. It's a terrible argument that doesn't hold up.
---
Y'all realize that hundreds of thousands have played on private servers and leveled multiple characters to 60 and have done that grind before, right? 
---
You also should realize that there are people like me who have played way, way tougher/grindier MMO's like everquest, tibia etc and find the Classic grind super manageable.
---
Another thing, I never played WoW during the pre-cataclysm era, so I have zero nostalgia for it. And yet, after playing on different private servers, it's the most fun I've ever had with the game.
---
Uhm I wouldn't say it's ninjaing, he does lose and the only other rogue is the one that says in chat that they were fine giving it to him. Giving glaive to a nonrog is pretty bad thematically, I don't know how good it is on a fwar or hunts.
---
Ackchyually
---
That is not a streamer, that there is a crying screaming baby.
---
Don't sweat it, these are great nonetheless :)
---
at some point an alt just happens - you get ganked on your main, you are camping a certain rare mob or can't find a good group for a specific dungeon you are parked in front, or you current ability rotation or open quests aren`t fun at the moment - so you create another char at at some point to take a break from a specific stage in the game but not the game itself
---
&gt;Because that was the problem with vanilla, how well you could play your class (even when most were pretty easy) was secondary to gear by a massive portion.
---
To you, this is a problem. To many people, this is not a problem. I actually tend to agree I just don't have any interest in your personal vision of vanilla like I said. 
---
Changing this also just doesn't logically follow with anything you've been talking about up to this point. It is very easy to get bwl gear. Casuals aren't prevented from it at all and if you're casual enough to where bwl gear isn't realistic for you then you honestly probably aren't going to be a competitive player regardless of what changes are made. Parents who play for 3 hours a week aren't exactly the pinnacle of mechanical skill either. 
---
&gt;I fought many players in vanilla with full t2 and high rank gear but were really bad.
---
Reality is effort is rewarded with power. I've fought many players in vanilla who had bad gear and were also terrible. Pretending people who barely play the game are these elite skilled players being held back by just their gear is laughable. It's much more likely that they also just suck. How good generally are people at things they don't have time to practice?
---
There are plenty of good players who won't put in the effort to obtain the best gear and they will for the most part do fine. There are plenty of bad players who will put in the effort to obtain the best gear and they will also do fine. It's the people who aren't good and who can't put in the time who lose out. 
---
&gt;I want to play vanilla, but use the power of hindsight to improve it. It doesn't need to have to have the same problems "bcuz nostalgia, I don't care I'm putting in 8 hours a day don't fix anything"
---
People want to play the game they played 15 years ago, warts and all. Could I improve vanilla dramatically if I were given reign over the project? Absolutely. Does anyone want to play that? Nope.
---
I think they did it as a joke, another reason they held the glaive until the end. Secondly he made a point that he was getting unlucky on gear drops so the other rogue could have gotten multiple upgrades.
---
badlands is lvl 40
---
You cant even do 40 man raids without the server crashing.
---
You almost never need teamplay and communication in dungeons or to create the dungeon group in the first place.
---
You dont need interaction in most situations and you have sharding so it feels empty.
---
I think of the MMORPG just the O in the middle is left.
---
This clip would be so much better if they didn't give it to him
---
I really want to see MSBT but with the really nice TBC updates interjected into Classic.  Its critical to pair my windfury procs with my own sound files :P
---
If i remember correctly at the time the screenshot was taken i have already died a couple of times. I have a few more screenshots with bloody red gear and corpses over corpses after the event was over.
---
It's Sodapoppin, one of the biggest twitch streamers that became famous via world of warcraft. I'm glad you don't know him, because as someone mentioned earlier his viewerbase consists mostly of kids and he is the biggest manchild ever. So friggin spoiled...thats what happens when a young guy gets famous. He loses touch with reality. All he can think of is "THIS BELONGS TO ME, I'M SO IMPORTANT, GIVE ME STUFF AND WORSHIP ME"
---
Wait I think I'm not following. So they rolled off on the glaive, the other guy won, and the master looter gave it to the streamer anyway? Is that Sodapoppin? I don't really follow wow streams
---
Is that actually a thing?!  No way..
---
And the other rogue didn't mind giving it to him
---
I get you completely. I find his stream act so irritating and part of that is because I know he is a much better personality than that from his old YouTube channel where he used to give calm, well reasoned opinions about all aspects of the game. It's a shame he doesn't do that anymore
---
I mean, if you want to generalize every single streamer out there, sure go ahead. Very mature way of looking at things. :)
---
Druid for sure. Shaman is a close runner up, but #1 is undoubtably Druid.
---
LF Guild - Warrior (Pref - Main Tank) - EU Alliance - PVP (pref RP-PVP)
---
Hi There,
---
What am I looking for:
---
I'm looking for a (semi)hardcore raiding guild. Raid days don't matter that much, but really prefer not to raid on saturdays, but that's optional! :) Furthermore, looking for a guild that has a mindset that is close to my own (more to follow later in this post). Main focus should be on raiding, but I'll be playing it a lot, so anything related to wow is fine in my book. 
---
Who am I:
---
27 year old from the Netherlands (yes, I live near Amsterdam). I've been playing this game since (it almost seems) forever. Yet, I've been stopping on and off since WoD / Legion / BfA. I came to the conclusion I'm really fed up with the current game and I really want to go back to the roots. I've been playing WoW since the very beginning, but only got into hardcore raiding in TBC. My peak was around Mists, where I was consistently on the top 100 healer list, even though my main was a tank! So you can see that I'm very passionate about this game and I want to take things to the limit. I've been playing on and off on private servers as well and always been tanking on these kind of servers, so I really want to have that opportunity again in Classic.
---
I can rattle on and on about the game, so pop me a message when you're interested :)
---
Cheers!
---
Nievè#2526
---
But see that was one of those surprising/annoying things that made classic. Kinda like if they did progression, it’d be pretty cool if only for a day they released the plague the screwed everything back in the day right before wrath.
---
Yes and yes
---
Everyone is in IF anyway

How about just the cringe over the whole concept. Grown men without jobs spending their days playing video games on camera begging for money from people who get to see the "content" for free regardless of paying or not.
---
DUDE!! SELL! SELL! SELL! 
---
That makes their stock drop and they panic and release the game to counter it!
---
Whatever you choose it won't be more than 1 or 2 hours behind the fastest.
---
But to answer your question I would say hunter. It will be a bit slow until you get your pet  at lvl 10, but after that it's very fast.
---
I really wonder if guilds will go back to DKP with classic? Because there could be many nuances for who gets loot that this clip doesn't convey. 
---
What is the general consensus for using DKP with this sub? Are more for or against it?
---
Trolls are the best horde race for mages for PvE encounters though
---
This just in: Domino's can differ in quality depending on where you are. Shock horror.
---
Completely agree. Classic is about remembering what was good in Azeroth! We all know what the raids are like... No point in rushing just to kill Ragnaros over and over again.
---
Let us know, we're planning on horde
---
Nonono. My way is better way. You stupid.
---
Unless it ends up retailing better, like OSRS ended up doing.
---
My guild intends to use dkp or a variant. On pservers dkp is very common
---
Your argument only makes sense if classic is basically done and they have the option to release classic at any point during the summer. 
---
I could use the same argument to say that they said “summer” while fully intending to release in September which was really pushing it, but are rushing to get it done by then for the sake of the shareholders.
---
We know that they most likely won’t release an unfinished product.
---
We don’t know how close they were to being finished when they gave the release window(we only saw westfall/barrens and the huge list of technical problems), or how close they are to being finished now. 
---
We also don’t know how much say the financial side of blizzard has over the classic team. 
---
Aka, predictions based solely on the stock price of acti-blizzard are meaningless.

Sodapoppin is pure cancer. I learned this years ago when I heard he was running a Project 60 / 70. It sounded fun, but the reality was he and his buddies take everything they want, make up the rules as they go, then abandon the project as soon as possible since he's an ADD variety streamer, taking 90% of the playerbase with him, which guts the entire project leaving everyone else without any hope of completing the raids.
---
Make it your top priority to avoid all interaction with this toxic asshole in classic.
---
I didn’t though. I’m talking about the culture and the fact the most popular ones usually fall into that “annoying loud streamers” category.
---
I’m sure there are interesting, insightful streamers. Sorry to have offended your sensibilities, but I think you completely missed the point of my post / didn’t bother to read it. 
---
To your point, I do agree that generalizing often blurs the perception and reinforces subjective bias, but it just isn’t the case here, if you bother to read the original post and spend a couple seconds thinking.
---
I’m excited for everything about vanilla. All aspects together is needed to create this beauty.

---
I remember when cata came out blizzard promised dungeons would be hard again. It was so nice after the face rolls that were wrath, but it was also hillarious reading the reactions of those who wanted free shit without fighting for it. I forget the name, but there was some worm boss in early cata that hit like a truck and broke up many pugs! XD
---
I'd go with an actual Scottish loch for Loch Modan, and the Australian Outback for Durotar.
---
Nice try. I will still rush 60
---
knowing that 2.0 class design exists only a few months after the version we're getting
---
In b4 all the tryhards downvote and claim you're telling people how to play.
---
You're not wrong. Gunning for 60 on your own to get ahead of the curve is a pointless exercise. Play retail if you think leveling is an inconvenience.
---
Please don't tell people how to enjoy playing the game
---
I am sad nobody liked my joke
---
Probably his much of a pain in the ass getting dungeon groups together was. I loved doing dungeons to break up the monotony of the grind but, I remember on occasion is taking hours to get a decent group together and then wait for everyone to get there total snooze fest. While I'd love to keep classic as pure as possible I would honestly love a version of dungeon finder however only server wide to not lose the sense of community just to make it a but easier then sitting on org or uc and spamming lfg chat. Runner up is probably how impossible epic mounts were to get however I don't see either of these things changing.
---
Imagine watching some kid play decades old video games for "entertainment"
---
I rolled on it like a bitch
---
On the topic of reportings, please don't resub until close to launch guys. We should keep sub numbers as low as possible, so they can appreciate us refined gamers of good taste.
---
meh its entertainment the only streamer i sometimes watch is drdisrespect and its just because hes outrageous stupid on purpose and thus very entertaining. definitly dont look up to him or worship him just think hes a funny guy who makes a living off it
---
To buy your favorite rpg game wow of warcraft.
---
people trying to recreate their first mmo experience are extremely delusional and will only be disappointing when reality hits them
---
Honestly I'd euthanize people who watch streams especially people who post about it.
---
I shouldn't have to be aware of who "pewpewdie" is.
---
yeah true, I was just Talking about the turn in - whole ungoro is about a lvl I guess
---
lol someone in chat said "who the hell forgot to call his mother??"
---
holy shit, I've never seen this. They literally gave the legendary to the lowest rolling rogue. What a crap guild
---
Just don't join a guild with a big streamer in it? A guild leader/officer is likely to take any legendary item/component as well.
---
The other rogue rolled higher but they never said anything, did they pass? Only one I seen going crazy was a warrior.
---
A lil off topic, but whatever happen to DKP?
---
Hey guys I don't want to tell you how to play. I just want you to understand what kind of game you will miss with rushing. If you are hardcore player you don't need any advices you have already made your choice.
---
You bout to get FAT XP
---
As much as i'm excited for the dungeon experience and being to actually interact with actual real live people.. i do get PTSD flashbacks to some insanely horrible dungeon experiences...
---
Waiting for everyone to fucking get there.
---
Summoning.
---
Someone leaving right at the beginning or halfway through or before the final boss.
---

---

---
I  also just get many flashbacks to Zul Farrak or RFD taking like hours and hours. Or sunken temple. FML.
---
Blizzard should just designate streamer only servers, keep all the fuckwits in one place.
---
It will matter a lot. His rabid and toxic fan base will overcrowd the server and cause rampant problems. And when he streams other things, and believe me he will, the population of the server will drop off dramatically because thousands will only be there because he is, so they can do his bidding, or troll him, or just cause problems for stream visibility. But you go ahead and play there and find out for yourself. I'll be for sure avoiding the well known streamer servers.
---
4 months ago, I would have agreed with you.
---
But based on the discussions with my old TBC raiding guildies about Classic WoW, I'm less optimistic now.
---
Isn't these days there are better systems like EPGP?
---
Very Hard to get. Extremely rare as very few guilds killed KT.
---
Why do you care about how people experience the game?
---
I won’t “rush” to 60, I’ll probably do a dungeon or two and do some world pvp when I’m bored, but 95% of my time playing will be trying to get to 60 ASAP. 
---
That’s how I want my experience to be. I read your post, now perhaps you should take time to read this short advice: stop trying to control things you can’t control. This path leads to disappointment.
---
Why such a rush?
---
I'm EU so I won't be playing on his server. I still doubt that you will notice his presence as much as you think.
---
Yes, but the toxicity plague spreads. Toxicity on these servers is comparable to the corrupted blood pandemic. It's definitely possible to find a safe haven in another guild, but there's always that looming threat all around you.
---
The lack of group finder from TBC.  While it won’t be an issue if we get the community we have all missed but it does help remove a lot of the LFG clutter in the chat.
---
Also currently waiting 3 months or so for the release and then waiting to phase 3 for the release of WSG.  That’s kind of annoying but hopefully everyone’s nostalgia of world PvP isn’t just rose tinted glasses to fill that gap.
---
Just imo tho.
---
It seems that DKP went away when the reduced raid sizes to 25 mans, or at least that's what I remember. To be honest, I'd hate to raid in a 40 man without DKP, my rolls are awful and I have some tier .5 experiences that still haunt me to this day lol.
---
While i dont agree in telling people not to rush, i also dont think telling people to not rush and enjoy the game is them trying to recreate their first mmo experience. the game is fun while leveling, leveling is a huge part of the game, leveling professions and doing dungeons is really fun. IDK where you get the idea everyone is trying to recreate their first mmo experience
---
&gt; Either play the game my way or go play a different game
---
Very few got it in Vanilla. Like not even 1/per server. But mostly because there wasn't enough time to grind for it before TBC came. It is ofc hard to get but we will see plenty more of them if Blizz aint planning on ninja-launching TBC on us summer of 2021
---
The ranking in pvp sounds like a pain, as I only played endgame during tbc. It doesnt sound like I have the time needed to become well geared in pvp, but pvp is what I love the most.
---
Bonus question: what spell/skill will you miss the most from other expansions?
---
 As a shadow priest I think I’ll miss vampiric touch the most. Being able to regain health AND mana was great
---
I don't think I've heard of either of those, mind sharing some more info or a link?
---
I’m glad that you’re going to be enjoying your time leveling because that will make me feel that much cooler when I’m in full tier 1 while you’re still level 30 😇
---
For many of us, the funnest part of the game is being a hardcore neckbeard that’s more geared than everyone else. It’s weirdly elitist to try to tell people how to play the game, like you think your way is better and to play differently is wrong. 
---
I’m not going to try to tell casuals to be more hardcore lol.. you play the game how you want and I’ll play it how I want.
---
"I don't want to tell you how to play, just don't play this way!"
---
Okay
---
Why the hell do you care how a bunch of strangers play?  It doesn't affect you at all.  Maybe focus on you.
---
Rushing to 60 is how some people legitimately enjoy the game. I don't, but some do. It's fine if they don't agree with you. It will be ok. I promise.
---
I'll be going for PvE servers this time around, pretty much for the same reasons as you. My playtime is limited and while I loved WPvP in my younger days, I have a job and kids to take care of.   
---
Plus side of a PvE server is that you can flag when you wish and keep the flag turned on as much as you like, and I think people forget this.   
---
I didn't play on a PvE server in Classic, but from my understanding the TM v SS or Crossroads wars still happened.
---
Surprised at the lack of Loch Ness, for Loch Modan, and I would also add this one:

---
"My way is better, trust me!"
---
I agree, However rushing to 60 has A LOT of benefits. Not saying you have to do it, or youll miss out if you dont. But to say its pointless is just false.
---
It got me torn between rolling mage and war
---
To be fair, Sodapoppin changed during these years as a person as well as this community. He would probably feel ashamed about OP exposing this video like he feels shame about most of the content from the past. I couldn't watch him for most of his "career", but lately, he just has that chill vibe when he is playing some custom Warcraft 3 maps, having it on the background while you are busy doing other things.

I remember a couple guys in my guild loaded up their quest log with as many as they could complete and when BC launched, they went and turned them all in. I'm not sure how much XP they got, but it took them about a week hunting down quests and completing them.
---
Damn Zoomers and your fortnite dances!
---
Hahahaha what the heck! 
---
“In b4 all the tryhards downvote and claim you're telling people how to play.” And you proceed to try to tell tryhards that their way of playing is wrong! 
---
What is with casuals being elitist about being casual hahaha
---
id love if there were specific classic servers where streaming is NOT allowed and a banable offense
---
Dude, PvE is the way if you want to focus on a journey made of quests and friends.
---
*no positives!?*
---
It's Legion's client, so all the 1.12 addons that work on private servers won't, but you'll most definitely have versions of most current addons backported to whatever patch version classic releases on. I wouldn't fret too much about it.
---
We all know what leveling is like too?? wdym
---
 Getting 100gp for a mount
---
Things like these go to dedicated guild officers as a reward. If you do plan on having this you better be loved by your community.
---
It will be a beautiful mess
---
&gt;Chances are if you're wiping in a dungeon so bad that all of your gear is red, the people you're running the group with are shit, and reputation with them doesn't matter at all.
---
What part of the above quoted section implies that there's only 1 person who's a problem? Seems to me that the entire group is being damned.
---
And in the situation I was in where the tank was an idiot, the tank had lead. And there was no mechanism available in game to vote a party member out. So the 4 of us were in a situation where we either stuck with it, or leave the group. We couldn't get rid of the idiot until he left in disgust. And once that millstone was removed from our collective necks, the 4 of us were actually able to finish the instance.
---
also u gotta consider the gold/h of ur main compared to the hours burned leveling alts
---
for most it wont be worth it
---
So pretty much the same story as the Corrupted Ashbringer.
---
Agreed, anywhere Mid-West USA or Western Canada (east of BC) would work better.

---
&gt; Do a large amount of people still opt in for PvP on PvE at 60? Does the TM vs SS battle still happen?
---
Yes. Your best bet is to join /WorldDefense and you'll see a lot of activity.
---
My experience playing on pvp servers was that most of the pvp activity was larger-scale raids at the level cap where people could go zerg other areas without a lot of resistance because it takes a long time to build up a counter-strike against a group of 30 players.
---
On pve servers, it was smaller groups attacking towns so it was easier to show up with a friend or two and put up a resistance.

History: I played vanilla back when wow first came out, I raided on an alliance warrior up to naxx 40. Didn't get a chance to do it then. I played on nostalrius til it was shut down, didn't really raid then. Just played a dwarf priest to 60. Also play retail off and on and raid
---
It's not just the ganking aspect though, while it does play a part in rolling on a PvP realm it's the whole sense of added danger that it gives the world and just creates another level of immersion that helps add to the charm of Vanilla. 
---
I like the idea that large group of players can mob up and completely shut down a zone for the opposing faction by killing anyone who tries to get passed them. While it can be frustrating when it happens to you there's nothing actually stopping you from going to another zone to level or better yet starting your own counter raid to fight them off. Some of my most found memories of a certain Server that no longer exists comes from battling it out 40vs40 in Ashenvale, the shimmering flats and STV all of which happened during the leveling process. 
---
It got even crazier at level 60 when world bosses came into play and when PvP guilds started to camp BRM at peak raid times. It was fucking mental to walk down the tunnel into BRM to all of a sudden be greeted by an entire raid group that had like 20+ mages who come flying around the corner straight into the raid and wiping everyone within seconds.  Yes it was annoying to die and lose our world buffs but the excitement and nerves we used to get when we had to group up and make our way inside BRM was incredible and completely worth the few downsides that come with it.
---
Imo I don't think there should be transmog in any xpac, if you want to look fancy you can equip your fancy clothes and run around city

---
This is 100% ninjaing, just not the "take every item and hearth out" kind that is more popular on Youtube. All the loot trading complaints were about this exact kind of situation: the guy who wins the roll just handing it to his friend (even if in this case the "friend" is just a guy with a camera attached to his computer who yells a lot).
---
"Thematically" is not a good enough reason to take an item. People rolled because they wanted/needed it for their character. Unless the item is literally unequippable or extremely suboptimal (spell damage items on Rogue, for example), it should go in order of roll if for some reason the highest roller declines it. To engineer a situation (by whining and screaming, mind) where a person who rolled the actual lowest roll of all players is just theft, pure and simple.
---
This cannot be tolerable unless specifically specified in the raid rules beforehand (which I severely doubt, given the thief's meltdown upon rolling low). Unless the raid was set up with the stipulation that all loot is given to a random player before being considered for others, it is ninjaing, pure and simple. The item was stolen by the streamer's force of "popularity" and the intensity of his tantrum. 
---
I was undecided on "streamer servers" before, but now I am 100% determined to avoid them. This is extremely toxic to the gameplay experience in the same way other ninja looting is, but I have never before seen people defend a ninja looting scenario like this one. The item did not go to the person who legitimately won it, and that is simply unacceptable.
---
&gt; If you flag yourself it'll be other people initiating the fights and putting you at a disadvantage anyway.
---
There are people who perma-flag on pve servers.
---

I was pushed into the Horde in classic from friends. Rolled Troll Shaman so I had fun. But that Dwarf Paladin only ever got to 16. I aims to go back to Dwarf.
---
Once a guild has naxx on farm it won’t take very long for one person to get atiesh, maybe a couple months? And there will definitely be way more guilds clearing naxx this time around. The difficult part is being the person that’s chosen to get it... 
---
I have no idea how to quantify the amount of time that would take. If you’re the most dedicated and helpful caster in the guild on top of being an officer from the first raid your guild has until naxx then you’ll probably get one.

Right that's the point, if you like pvp interfering with PvE go for it roll on a pvp server.  If not roll on a pve server, there's always BG's if you want pvp.
---
Tauren shamans. 
---
got the most thematic atmospheric class quests, and quite a lot of them and long. you run around as a wolf. you healing spell is a green beam (chain heal). you connect with nature elemntals, like fire, wind, water. and all the spells are related to it. in names animations and everything. EVERYTHING feels very nature related.
---
and tauren race itself is nature focused. tauren is an acronym for nature, if you didnt know, with just letters moved around.
---
druids are more of magic type of creatures, aswell as night elfs, and their own tradition and order, coming from cenarius. they dont really deal with elementals of nature directly. they more of a mages of a certained specific type, that can turn different animal forms. they also not very druidic in a traditional meaning of this world. Also like half of their spells they reach and manipulate energies out of this world not nature related. moonfire, starfire, Faerie Fire.. one of their their main spells called Wrath.. imagine that, how is this nature realted. compare it to shamans. so ya they are a specific mage type of guys. and feral spells are just beast spells like shred, maul, rip, bash etc.
---
when shamans are directly refering to nature, mother earth and its powers and elementals. And all their spells are about it.
---
hunters aren't really nature related. its a modern guys, shooting bullets and arrows, using traps, marks, different types of shots and so on. its not really nature loving period. yes you tame pets to serve you but thats about it.

Even less common than the Ashbringer since it was just a drop whereas Atiesh required multiple runs on top of good RNG.

&gt; Classic is about remembering what was good in Azeroth!
---
Oh, I must have missed the meeting where we've all collectively decided what classic is all about...
---
I 100% understand that. I assume there are many that will make ports of popular ones, hence this list/requests.
---
It's called EPGP just google it (sometimes called DKP reloaded). It works like everyone has EP and GP points, EP is something points, basically good raider points, that you get for visiting raids, killing bosses, etc as well as getting EP decreased for fails or not committing to the raid. And GP is the gear points that you get when you get gear (certain pieces of gear have a different amount of points, 2h weaps probably the highest). So when it comes to deciding who will get a piece of item who gets it depends on the coefficient that you need to have the best ratio of the higher EP and lower GP amount. And every week both EP and GP gets cut down by like 30%.
---
Levels 1-20. I've done them *so many times*. But meh, that'll be over in day 2.
---
We used to take volchan to UC.  Took forever but watching everyone run from us made it all worth it
---
Which has only happened on private servers. In vanilla, raids were made up of mostly friends who had been raiding together since molten core. The raids werent hard enough until halfway through naxx to even need class stacking. Like my guild had probably 6 warriors, we had probably 7 or so hunters. Druids were a bit more fluid as all the druids were also all the warlocks so it depended how many healers we had show up that night. Id say the guild i raided with was actually fairly close to 5 of every class give or take 1-2 depending on peoples alts and who was available on a given night. Raiding is just a means to an end though. We only did it to get gear for pvp. Once you have some aq40/naxx mix of gear you blow through all the raid content, and you can only get marginally better equipped for pvp.
---
Talking about “ideal” raids in vanilla is stupid as loot is gated to 1-2 drops per boss so there is no way youre getting 10 warriors bis gear in any sort of efficient timespan. Plus the mechanics are so simple youre basically talking about optimizing a raid for lfr.
---
ingame chat, friends list, community, what a luxury right

You could pay for your sub for classic by farming on retail and buying tokens on retail yeah, but that doesn't affect the economy of classic at all.

well, that or they will be hated because you're bad causing the wipes in the first place:p
---
Just level alts and farm gold in Phase 1 so when there is 3-4 raids out you have plenty of gold for consumes!
---
So Druids, Hunters and Shaman all love nature the same ammount but in different ways. 
---
The Druid loves all manner of plant, critter and beast but knows that there needs to be a balance between them. The druids will populate or destroy individual species that are inbalanced. They actively seek out corruption of forests to destroy the cause.
---
The Shaman is a little less about what lives on the surface and focuses on the actual surface and below. They want to keep the four primary elements from murdering each other and causing a huge catastrophe. They basically work full time to prevent the Cataclysm expansion from happening. 
---
Hunters take a more direct approach to the killing part that Druids do but they do it in a loving way. These are people who have left their respective civilizations to wander about in the forests and meadows looking for friends and a purpose. Largely they have found it in the beasts they tame who they have a great affection for. 
---
Shamans create a world on which life can thrive, Druids protect and love that life, and Hunters like playing around in it.
---
there goes "launch it when it's ready" out of the windows
---
Blizzard has had numerous expansions to fix what is wrong with retail, and they've instead fucked it up more and more. There is no reason to believe anyone at Blizzard or Activision know what makes a great MMO anymore. The original developers are gone, and nobody left respects what Vanilla was or offered to the community. To let them change it would likely bring about retail-like class balance and/or features.
---
Something players should understand is that raiding is only one portion of world of warcraft vanilla. Many of the sub-optimal or meme specs are actually great in other areas of the game (elemental shaman is great in PvP, druids are great in world pvp and battlegrounds especially). I want some of the shitter dps / tank specs to be more viable in a raid environment, but it is not worth the risk of allowing Blizzard/Activison to change the game in any capacity. It's an unfortunate reality. 
---
I do support class updates/balance/content post-Naxx though, and I hope that is what we get.
---
I'm going to ensure I'm not there to find out!
---
Flow chart unclear, got dick stuck in ceiling fan.
---
I think we will all be surprised at its popularity. Itll have it's own fanbase, and many retail players will have alts on it instead of the main game, or vice versa.
---
only subbing AFTER the game launches, cheesy activision blizzard are not fooling me again
---
You get decent gear gear through the faction vendors, as well.  Rank 10 is pretty easy to get.  You shouldnt worry about the gear.
---
Atiesh is basically a grind. You need to kill a lot of naxx bosses until you have enough shards, once that is achieved, you also need to ofc have cleared kt (which you pretty much need anyway to get enough shards). So yeah, you needed to be one of the guilds to clear kt and then at most 1 in that guild got it, if any.
---
Haven't seen this one before, and I liked it; reminds of all the great moments I had raiding in vanilla.
---
I wish I had the PC capable of recording back then. Maybe in Classic, who knows.
---
It makes me want to share my favorite Onyxia video: [Onyxia 8 man Horde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFAUEId4PQg)

I'm really really REALLY not looking forward to the absolutely titanic flood of complaints that we're going to get once classic launches. Both here and on the wow forums.
---
The people in this sub are a tiny tiny fraction of the people who are going to play classic when it launches. There will be hundreds of thousands of retail players who jump in just for the fuck of it. When they die at level 2 because they pulled two mobs? When they can't afford to repair their gear? When they get lost while doing a quest? Yeah, they're going to drown us all in their tears.
---
Well everything can be a different experience if you want it to be. 
---
Try raid Ragnaros naked - BAM - different experience.
---
Whichever you might be interested in having at 60.
---
I'm both excited and "scared" of the Stranglethorn massacre.
---
Cool gallery, but would have wished that all of the WoW ones were on the same side
---
It came out so late in Vanilla and required you to do dedicated farming of some of Vanilla’s hardest content, in order for one person in an entire guild to get it. It’s probably the rarest legendary (with the exception of Talisman but that was a loot table error anyways) in the entire history of the game.
---
Mobs ignore it and keep right on casting against a bubble or an iceblock or a banish.
---
A paladin would frequently use their bubble while soloing against caster mobs for example, not because they wanted to attack more slowly and be immune (but maybe on occasion yes) but rather because an immunity effect with nobody else on the aggro table should cause a caster mob to close to melee range and start whacking the bubble with their stick. 
---
So far I have seen exactly zero pservers get this right. One of the more recent ones gets it closer than the others, where the mobs will take a step closer, then cast, then take a step closer, then cast... but none of them have managed to get the effect right yet.
---
They also remove falling damage under blessing of protection in Vanilla. That was not added until Wrath. 
---
Another thing they do is allow mobs to resist aoe damage... You cannot resist aoe in vanilla... Now I do not know for sure if that is every school but I do know for sure that Consecrate would damage mobs far above your level in vanilla and would never once have a resist.
---
I did a very small amount of googling. It seems there may have been a few quests that require you to be dead. I have very few sources though. Also idk what expansion that was during or if at all during vanilla.

40 splinters

FFXIV Shadowbringers releases  **Tuesday, July 2, 2019.**
---
Expect classic to be about two weeks in front of that. Why? Because that's just how WoW has always timed their releases. Find their biggest rival and try to cut them off at the knees.
---
It's Tanzania not Tasmania.
---
Kazzak raiding Org was one of my favorite WoW days.
---
That is super handy! I've heard plenty of these stories, but also plenty of stories where someone just vendored literally everything on the account and mailed it out, which always seemed so wasteful to me. You really gonna vendor someones entire tier 2 for the like, 105 gold that must be worth? REALLY?
---
This is done on project 70 on retail servers, all gear is a literal joke and has meaningless stats to certain classes. Agi does NOTHING its not even a stat on wars, secondly agi is rog primary stat meaning it does more than 1ap per agi. The other rogue was the one that opted to give it to him as they are the only 2 that can use its stats. Agi is equivalent to spell damage on a warrior... they both do nothing
---
ZF taking hours?  Of all the instances I remember that seems like one of the quickest.  Easy paths to take (can't really get lost), optional bosses to skip, and not an absurd amount of trash packs.
---
Was ashbringer common? Thought it was a rarity like the legendary necklace.
---
My altoholism and probably never getting 60.
---
Pre-nerf cata dungeons were fantastic. Especially the heroic versions. I'm still sad they made them easier.
---
Ok Good! I need to look into it more still but I’m trying not too get too hyped up 😅
---
no you could summon them while youre all in the instance. then the summoned person hearths while still in the instance and with the summin que up. then he repairs and accepts summon and boom hes back right where the grp was. problem with lock summoning is you cant summon someone outside of an instance while inside the instance this is a workaround
---
I wish paladins could have spiritual attunement (gain mana from being healed) so that tanking would be viable
---
O God, I never thought of this as a possibility....Going to have nightmares now.
---
No please do whatever you want.
---
Yeah I feel that
---
No not common at all just much more likely than Atiesh since to get the Ashbringer you just need an item to drop from a boss whereas the staff requires multiple drops from multiple bosses.
---
Pick / secure my character names.
---
Watch the chaos ensue and servers crash as blizzard once again does not plan properly for how popular Classic WoW will be.
---
Then, schedule my vacation for summer a couple weeks later when blizzard gets the servers stable enough.
---
I see your point, but Blizzard execs have stated multiple times that 2019 is a quiet year for Blizzard-Activision for content releases. They did not realize that their past successes (Overwatch, Candycrush, CoD etc.) would be so unpopular going into 2019 due to Apex, Fortnite, and other big games. As a whole, all their franchises are down and need something to rejuvenate their company soon.
---
It very well could be later Summer/Fall, but I’m not sure if the financial side will approve of that.
---
&gt; Also it makes sense to reference their past failure of retaining vanilla individuality as evidence that they would fail again. If anything doesn't that mean that they would have an outline of how to learn from this mistake?
---
This would absolutely make sense and people wish they would wake up and let vanilla philosophy guide their game change decisions. They have had chances and essentially failed 95% of the time.
---
I know this is partially a meme, but I played when Vanilla was live and I don't know anyone who would be offended if someone left due to entire gear breaking.
---
It's one thing to have a few wipes, but if you go 5+ it isn't unreasonable to think you all may be wasting each others time. The only exception might be like, a full BRD run where you should be setting aside a few hours. But for a normal dungeon? There are issues if you are wiping that many times and no one held it against me/others if you bailed.
---
Yikes my sleep deprived spelling was awful lol. Thanks for pointing that out. Fixed.
---
After seeing him and Preach in the same podcast thingy. It is so apparent what the difference between a pleb (Asmongold) and a real gamer (Preach) is immense. The only reason to watch Asmongold is to be fascinated by the lack of hygiene.
---
Why don't you go ahead and name all the items and enchantments he has in that video, if its so easy?
---
Yeah I mean I agree and I really don’t fucken wanna play on a streamers server but literally all my friends want to. This fucken sucks
---
iirc there’s a bit in badlands with some juicy dragons that are a decent farm, sure they were elite as well
---
I see so many people complain about locks doing this when I'm leveling on classic, but if only one mob is being properly focused and the tank has good enough threat you're fine. I love it if locks have dots rolling on mobs we are going to focus next as long as they watch threat.
---
did he take the boat or zeppelin?
---
Yea she is not exactly a gamer but also not opposed to it. Maybe I’ll let her play an alt I roll or something to see if it hooks her. 
---
Out of curiosity, what classes are you guys rolling??
---
They could file for bankruptcy before classic releases. Then what
---
buy high sell low
---
I understand. Legion to BfA was a brutal fucking blow for me on Shaman.  They removed so much of it's fun funk, and it just totally lost its groove. For a moment it felt like they were getting it again, but alas money over fun.
---
hopefully you are right
---
Nope, anyone can get it.
---
hopefully there are not quest addons at all at launch. would be if everyone has to level without questhelper and so on.
---
As a warlock player primarily, I disagree with warlock. They're up there, thanks to pet management and a lot of abilities, but I think hunters and rogues beat them out. They don't have a lot of reactive abilities like Vanish or Feign Death that require fast reaction speed. As a caster, staying at the appropriate range is less of an issue. Not really any "burst windows" or major cooldowns to worry about. Mana is the simplest resource to manage by far. Most abilities are straightforward, and you just use them when you can. 
---
Hunters have kiting and traps, auto timing, positioning matters more than any other class, plus a pet. Rogues have a ton of powerful abilities and cooldowns, but have to choose carefully which to use and when, while also managing energy/combo points with precision. The number of things a good rogue can pull off in the space of a couple seconds is ridiculous. 
---
I think casters just don't have the same level of decision making.
---
you will be wildly disappointed then
---
Good changes. None of them would remove the feel of vanilla, so I don't really see any good arguments against it.
---
Vanilla was fun because it was a new adventure and we were willing to overlook some of the shitty implementations of systems/content.
---
Now we have the power of hindsight and do what we can to actually provide a fresh experience.
---
Funny how the "no changes" crowd is OK with playing with all the class revamps in but can't handle the idea of crossrealm BGs.
---
Maybe it's because they didn't have a shitty unbalanced server with 1hr queues and lopsided, boring BGs 90% of the time
---
Personally I used to not enjoy levelling through BC content that much, but only because you're forced to go through Hellfire Peninsula with every character and any zone will get boring when you have to do it x amount of times with no other choice (worse for me because I never liked the zone anyway)
---
Get the earthbind totem aoe increase talent, and just run in circles around the mob while searing totem whittles it down, frost shocking occasionally if earthbind gets resisted twice in a row. Takes centuries but you can solo anything that can be slowed.
---
Can't wait to see this in game. I've 0layed since tbc and never got to see any kited things at all
---
You know whats annoying? Another player killing me while Im picking that black Lotus.
---
Shit goes both ways.
---
It is .:-)
---
You forgot spending hours on the login screen
---
2D sprites iirc
---
Like that one commment SM runs... (as alliance) not sure if i wanna run horde or alliance yet as i prefer alliance zones over horde.  but running to SM as alliance is a PAIN! IN THE A\*\* then you get the lazy kid who just won't run and want a summon if you have a lock.
---
you raid maybe 1-4 hours a week esp in phase 1. Just respec after before and after raid. your pickpocket farming will pay for this and well beyond it
---
Iirc no, and if there is it is likely low.
---
Can’t confirm lvl 1s but I vividly remember level 20 or 30 twinks being present at the arena on numerous occasions (presumably to loot the chest).
---
So, in this particular instance, those people may have wanted it for transmog or just the achievement instead. If all gear is, as you say, "a literal joke", then any argument that a Rogue has to have it is ludicrous. 
---
Again, the problem here is that someone used his social influence and power to get an item he lost the roll for. There were other people who wanted it, and by the raid's rules (barring the "all items reserved for the streamer" rule which likely was not stated during this raid, given the streamer's reaction), he should not have got the item. 
---
This will be a different kind of situation in Classic, as there are no achievements or transmog to pollute the pool of people rolling on items. However, the key is that the raid's rules were followed. If a streamer wants to organize a raid of people to funnel loot to him, I wish them the best of luck. In any other circumstance, it is unquestionably ninja looting.
---
My first character was on a PVE server, and honestly leveling was kind of boring. When you ran into someone from the enemy faction there was no suspense. I got bored running around Un’goro and actually quit my 52 priest.
---
Then I started a fresh warrior on a PVP server. The game had been out for over 6 months at this point so there were a lot of high levels already. Trying to get into Scarlet Monastery unmolested was an epic journey. Everything was just that much more enjoyable when you’ve got your head on a swivel and make friends with allies. Never got camped.
---
Grinding gold and finding dungeon pugs.
---
I would be happy if they announced what date they were going to disclose the release date.  If the disclose date is after peoples vacation deadlines, then at least they can make other plans.
---
Releasing ZG without fixing Corrupted Blood would be funnier.
---
I just found out my new job doesn’t give out vacation time until after one year. I accrue it, just can’t use it for one year. RIP
---
Druids for animals. Most people saying Druids. But they are only in tune with the Nature of Azeroth. Shamans commune with the elements, which are present and part of the natural order of all worlds and planes.
---
I may be wrong, but as far as I know, Druids, The Emerald Dream, all of it only exist on or as part of Azeroth.
---
Let the Earthmother guide you.
---
All of the comments feed my current desire for a wow 2.0 or a reboot of xpansion.
---
Yeah I suppose that could be better just for stability sake, but I still don't find it so impossible for them to succeed with a smaller, niche, focused team.
---
Click the net or heal ability and it says "Added in patch 1.13.0.28211"
---
Classic is 1.12 tho? Or is it just 1.12 talents?
---
Why did you choose to crop out character name and the server? I want to check your achievs and see if that too is truly from vanilla or you got some transmog for karma.
---
Hm interesting, thanks for the reply! I was planning on frost mage aoe but I didn't really know how mobs react to ice block. For the most part I planned on avoiding ranged mobs (obvi) but I wanted to know what they'd do if I inadvertently pulled one or two.
---
I’m fairly certain that got patched out pretty quickly in vanilla, after it was abused. Given that we’ll be in patch 1.12, it shouldn’t be possible.
---
You can definitely still do damage as druid but you really have to know what you’re doing, have the right gear and you have to work a lot harder compared to a rogue, they also steal all your gear. 
---
I’m in the same boat as you though, not sure if I feel like healing and tanking since most groups will want me to do one of the two. But Druids in pvp are one of my favorite play styles in the game.
---
It is truly hilarious that should you get Atiesh in Classic, one of the rewards is a portal to the most pointless zone in the game.
---
This seems a pretty reasonable estimate if somewhat liberal.
---
Note however that if a guild is remotely serious about progression, 2-3 tanks should be funneled gear during the initial push.
---
Having at least one geared tank makes it easier on everyone so this shouldn’t create drama.
---
I've been stressing over what class to play for the past 3 months. I have narrowed it down to warrior/rogue i think.
---
An insecure little brat shouldn't be throwing stones over anyone's fragility
---
I’m not going to change a thing. If it is during a weekday I will return home after working full time, if needed go grocery shopping, come home and prepare dinner. After that see if I can login.
---
Dragon's Call, that sword was so fucking elusive.
---
I farmed that instance over and over and over just because of the effect. I wanted it so damn bad.
---
It finally dropped after 40-50 runs of it. 
---
I lost the roll to the other paladin who was a ret paladin in the dungeon, I was tanking. 
---
I cried.
---
Winter 2017 maybe
---
Perhaps STV to a lesser degree? Padded by the Page quests and Nesingwary animal quests.
---
And how in the world would you kite Kazzak to Orgrimmar? Getting him from the Eastern Kingdoms to Kalimdor would be more than a slight problem given that you need to zone there. Nope, never gonna happen. There are other bosses that could be kited to Orgrimmar.
---
\+ if you wipe you can use your mounts to get faster back to where you were.
---
So I made a short reply from my phone but since you gave me a beautiful write-up I'll return the favor.  
---
All of the people in this raid are friends, all of them know the streamer and know his personality, none of this was done with any slight of hand, or "i won but i give to my friends" they were literally just dicking with soda to mess with him and he rages because his viewers like that. I am not saying you have to like the guy, but watch his stream for 5 minutes and you will go "so this is how this guy is on stream I wouldn't hang with him" but people that choose to hang with him are well aware of how he acts.  
---
Now if everyone is in the group and is friends and rolls as a joke then gives it to someone, with everyones consent would you call that a ninja? Probably not, since ninja refers to taking a piece of loot that doesnt belong to you or shouldnt belong to you. What determines what belongs to you, well for most people its winning a 1-100 RNG battle with another set of players, which is what they did, clearly as a joke. They were probably all well aware soda was getting glaive and it was probably stated beforehand that they knew they werent going to be getting it.  
---
Now I stated thematically because this is done on retail, in legion. Legion does not allow for agi to give value to any classes that agi is not their primary stat. Meaning that for warriors (Who is the class that won the roll) It is literally a meme item that will downgrade his dps, and not do anything except thematically look better. As for hunters, only survival can wield melee weapons now (the others can wield but literally cant use any skills that arent pet related so im not going to count that) and survival uses a single 2h. The game doesnt work the way it did in TBC, so the only class that can EFFECTIVELY use the weapon and NOT MEME with it is rogue. Now the other rogue beat him in the roll, but states in guild chat that he clearly was passing it to soda and was happy about it.  
---
So the only other person that can use the weapon and should have rolled passes. Therefore soda is a ninja despite being the only one left that gets access to the loot? I dont buy it. Yeah he acts like a child, thats his personality, his average viewer I would guess is half your age maybe even younger.... Thats what they want to see and thats what makes him popular. He is someone that is hyper-emotional when it comes to wow (watch any of the clips people post of him...) and yeah, thats maybe not what you are fond of but a LOT of people like it. (not me, i dont watch him...) But to call him a ninja is just ignorance.... its just pure ignorance...
---
Holy hell I remember this website. What a blast from the bast.
---
I want to be a badass Paladin, rocking 25/26/0 holy reckoning (also doing mandatory healing of course). And I know that dwarf is master race for pvp without a doubt, but I just can't imagine getting my full T2 and a charger... and still looking like a fucking ugly dwarf. How do I cope? Will I get used to it? srs.
---
Oh Shoot, that's a good point OP
---
It's possible just improbable. 
---
They could, for example, reduce the mana cost for some of the shitty caster dps specs (elemental shaman, boomkin) without imbalancing much. It wouldn't necessarily make them meta viable but it would help push them in the right direction. Unfortunately they would likely change way more than that and ruin stuff that even experienced pserver players cannot foresee. Game balance is just a big slippery slope that even the smartest people struggle with grasping properly,
---
On the side bar there is a discord.  In there is a guild recruitment channel.
---
So you just make a new starter account which lets you view the characters on your other account(s)?  Sorry, it's been a while since I played so I don't entirely understand how their system works now.
---
Note: many pservers appear to have very generous spell damage coefficients (specifically mages)
---
Anecdotally, the only spell I ever saw hit for over 4K was shadowbolt (which was t even from a t3 geared lock) and the famous video of the super buffed shaman hitting a 25k chain lightning onto a super debuffed warrior (this was staged however)
---
Pyrovlast did hit like a truck, but all this frost mage burst on pservers is not like it was on live vanilla.
---
The legendary MC necklace dropped once and it wasn't supposed to be in the loot table.  They removed it from the loot table after the drop but let the one guy who got it keep it.
---
By how much is the video sped up?
---
Pvp servers piss me off very often, but playing on pve would make me feel like I only have one nut
---
You can make it to rank 10 casually, not fast but you can do it 11-14 requires dedicated time
---
My experience in vanilla,
---
The guild I was in killed KT about 2 weeks or so before the 2.0 patch hit. 
---
\- Priest with 40 splinters quit when we sat him for thaddius because he had dc'd a half dozen times that night
---
\- Mage got his 40 and complete atiesh on our first KT kill
---
\- Warlock started collecting shards and got to the mid 20's before TBC came out, completed the staff for him during t5 content when we ran some naxx runs for fun.
---
just quit, priorities first mr
---
Having to eat/drink after every mob or 2
---
Depends when it is. Honestly might work out better to skip the first day and then hit it hard after the masses are cleared out.
---
This is so helpful! Thanks a ton!
---
I remember, me and a friend farmed for these. 1 each, shaman and priest. Wasn't so bad when you had someone to farm with, but it still took a long time.
---
This shouldn't affect your choice.  Even by doing everything right you are highly unlikely to get Atiesh
---
You can log into your account and see the character list no matter what. No 2nd account no work-arounds needed. You just cant load into the game
---
Hi can I get a discord link?
---
Class balance issues with certain specs being bad.
---
When i logged in that day, the chat window was full of /yell and CAPSLOCK and i rushed to the gates of Stormwind to see what was going on.
---
I remember the pure fear and panic as well as excitement when i spotted the first wave of corpses and heard the sound of a dozen shadowbolts killing people next to me.  And then i saw this. 
---
I was a new player and 13 years old and i didn't really knew what was going on. I just stood there and watched beeing overwhelmed by the excitement. 
---
I will never forget.
---
But when the stairs bug out /facepalm
---
What a WASTE haha
---
That is very possible, I think he also bragged about having a high unarmed. How do I get that, and more importantly, WHAT is that?
---
Just make sure to hit at least Honored with your faction first for the 10g discount.
---
10g is chump change at max, but at 40 when your buying skills its seriously worth it.
---
That was possible in Vanilla. Not sure if it will be in Classic.
---
In early Vanilla you could actually summon people directly to where you were in the instance even if they were in Ironforge. Too many exploits for that apparently...
---
Just log in with our old account, there is no trick to it ;)
---
IDK if it will work with Kazzak, but I hope kite mechanics are like they were from all of Vanilla-Wrath. I think in Cata or MoP, they changed how leashes work.
---
I'm not going to be on this sub when the game first launches.
---
Not that I'll hate the sub or anything, but I'll be playing instead, not reading about WoW!
---
I think it depends how hardcore you're going to be. For a casual player I'd recommend spriest. They are quite strong in blues or casual level raid gear, and for casual content people won't mind so much inviting you to raids or letting you have DPS gear. 
---
But warlocks scale better, and are far more likely to get a spot+gear in a good raiding guild or a hardcore BG premade. On the flipside, they're definitely weaker than spriests until maybe T2 gear level. You also get to play around with a bunch of playstyles with multiple damage specs, rather than just shadow.
---
Its shit here aswell.
---
Well i don't play warrior so i don't know all the gear but i can easily recognise lionheart helm, onyxia tooth pendant, t2.5 gear, the skeram cloak, band of acuria and quickstrike ring on fingers, trinkets are earthstike and life-giving gem, etc...
---
As for enchant he probably have the bests ones. Just need to compare with the characters stats to be sure.
---
Yeah. Evidence that Kara was originally a vanilla raid.
---
As a warrior main, character investment was even more prevalent then the already high level in vanilla.
---
There were always plate repair bills to farm, or guildies needing a tank for 5 mans.
---
I would imagine hunters are efficient enough farmers/levelers/solo dungeoneers to be the most conducive to running alts.
---
they are also one of the better world pvpers so if you have to chase off a ganker they are a good main to have.
---
In vanilla the entire raid wasn't expected to be flasked all the time.  Yes that might be different for people from pservers who don't remember or didn't play in vanilla.
---
The insane amount of time it takes to level up to 60, the lack of gold until max level, those endless walks without any mount, the inability to upgrade your skills due to lack of gold etc
---
Lfg st have egg
---
I'm quitting my job for classic. The Horde needs it's boi.
---
FEMALE DWARF BEST RACE, they have a cute laught and the best dance ;) big boobs tho
---
For so long I've been set on druid for casual PvE and PvP, inc a lot of WPvP. I've recently discovered the mage class, and frost spec looks so much fun. Decent performance for two tiers of raid content, great control and fun in wPvP. I've never really played a caster in all of my years of WoW. Ignoring the fact that it's a popular class, should I go mage in Classic?
---
Save some money, ask for some time off unpaid?
---
If you feel that strongly, you should pick human. The painful decisions for me are between gnome and human for warrior, because swords for raiding, and escape artist for PvP, **and** I love both races. If I hated one of them and liked the other, it would be an easy decision for me.  
---
You will be looking at this character for hundreds if not thousands of hours, if not days. Don't pick one you hate for a part of a percentage 'better performance'. Pick the one you like seeing.
---
Because they continued to send envoys and one man armies instead of the entirety of the legion. Lets not pretend we could have stopped a legion invasion without player character immunity.
---
Nothing in the world could make me go Alliance.
---
Recruiting people who don't even have a character yet strikes me as odd. I won't even know what server I'm rolling on until my Vanilla guild makes up their mind.
---
I had a mini feeling about tuesday also, but my gut went for a wider perspective and said this week or next week the latest for a release date.
---
Don't believe so; I had grand arena master trinket on 2 level 19 twinks. I believe there was a level 1 or 10 twink who had it I saw in a video as well.
---
I had the same thought about pax east. So maybe your right cause I was wrong.
---
So, as it turns out, the raid all agreed. I have said, twice before, that that was fine, though there still is a person in the chat complaining, so I am somewhat suspicious of that claim.
---
In any case, I shall give you the benefit of the doubt. All that means as that everyone agreed to be ninja'd from, which is a perfectly acceptable rule. I would never join such a group, but I can see why others would like it, as a chance to grow in their favorite streamer's favor.
---
I fully admit ignorance of the raid's rules, as the video does not show that part of the raid's creation. Still, the scenario (and the other player's complaints) are very easily read as someone who did not explicitly state those rules, in which case it would absolutely be a ninja looting event.
---
This kind of behavior is only fine when the whole raid accepts it. My argument came from a belief that the raid did not, and despite your claims, I am still somewhat skeptical. You are still discounting the transmog/achievement benefit of the items, which can be a very strong motivation for some players, as rationale for the streamer taking the item. This is certainly not as clear cut as "shift loot and hearth out", but it is behavior that can only be tolerated in a raid that is specifically set up for it. I would never want to partake in such behavior, and I am still adamant on avoiding any sort of "streamer server" for that very reason.
---
Weird. He's wearing his Burning Crusade outfit.
---
We managed to complete one Atiesh pre-BC, having had KT on farm since the beginning of Oct 2006. It takes months to gather all the 40 splinters.
---
I think the pre raid BIS once DM comes out is [Bonecrusher](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18420), not sure about raid gear though
---
Thought it was the same for ashbringer.
---
I plan to play with 2 other irl friends on a Lan party at my house. Have a good chill time, take breaks for cooking food and stretching plus going for walks.
---
I really think it's important to just go for even short walks, it circulates the blood and refreshes me a ton!
---
The main reason I don't like alliance is because of the poor capital placements. You can't cross the continent without flying somewhere first, I hate that.
---
There’s something wrong with a black lotus spawn in Pservers. I don’t believe that it’s exactly the same like it was in Vanilla. The spots were camped like in our days in Pserves. When we were raiding in MC/AQ/Naxx the supreme flask was around 150g all over the time. It's impossible to imagine that every guild would used them for every raid. We used them only for DPS depended bosses like Patchwerk.
---
60s give more honor than low level players anyway, so the people grinding honor WANT to kill 60s
---
Trick word is : having naxx on farm
---
Getting farmed by Hunters rolling their face over their keyboard while leveling.
---
The terrible PvP rank system that promotes premades and makes you feel like not even participating. And when you do want to participate, you have to go waste a few hours grinding gold so you can respec.
---
Toxic people who still think that they're 13.
---
Depends on class a ton. Expect 2-3 items per boss, per week. For 40 people. That's ~30 items a week, between 40 people with 8 MC bosses and Onyxia (every 3 days). Main tanks can probably expect multiple per week, many people will go a few weeks without anything. Druids &amp; Hunters are almost always the first to compete a full tier set besides maybe the main tank.
---
Pets being absolutely gimped to hell and back (defensively speaking).
---
Without charges? No, feral Druid weapons are stat sticks exclusively,
---
Of course, but unless they make a non-Classic (TBC, new content, et cetera) addition to the 1.12 Classic servers, all the portal will actually do for you is take you to a zone with nothing in it.
---
I suppose the best use would be on a Horde Druid, to have easy access to Darkshire for ganking, but otherwise it's a very underwhelming reward (in contrast to the amazing stats on the staff itself).
---
Sure, I will PM you the link.
---
Path of least resistance. Spending a whole bunch of time and gold to simply increase DPS or clear a raid a little faster is not worth the investment for most casual guilds (especially not on easy content like Ony and Rag)
---
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if this and many other instance skips / split pulls are "accidentally" broken by the new engine. Whether or not Blizzard will fix them after remains to be seen.
---
Cant bubbleheart until level 50.

So first off, as ive stated in my other post, this is project 70. There is no transmogging or achievements (they dont consider these active) and are not valid reasons to want gear. Please be informed before you comment stupid shit. He didn't use his power or influence, as noone ever once even thought they were actually going to get the piece. Also soda is over-emotional like that all the time, he reacts that way to virtually every "no shit" thing that happens. [Watch him play golf and freakout...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNMyoJ2LUAk) Like thats his personality, hes not with random people that dont know him, hes not with people that havent played with him for a numerous hours at this point.  
---
Also the gear is a literal joke, but that doesn't mean they dont want to make the most insignificant upgrades thats exactly what they are doing. They are trying to perfect their gear for their playstyle. The only one that has any right to the gear in that raid setting by the rules of PROJECT 70 is the other rogue. Who clearly passes it to him, which you can see by his good natured responses in guild chat later in the video. You can also see the warrior go "I WON THE ROLL WTF" then "lol" in raid warning, because he is CLEARLY JOKING. Noone wanted the gear for themselves over soda in this video, they wanted chat to think so, because controversy is very good for getting viewers and donations.
---
First, ranged dps classes and healers were always needed on my server.
---
Second, There is no absolute ban on meme specs, and many can actually bring meaningful contributions depending on raid composition.
---
Our guild for instance ran a lot of cloth wearers which made an oomkin desireable in the raid.
---
We also happened to run a prot pally (who was poached by the top naxx guild on our server) and running a prot pally meant we also used a retnub for the holy dmg aura.
---
Our guild was not super competitive as far as progression went, but several of our players were best on the server and we had a good time going at our own pace.
---
Had some spare time at work and sadly only have access to MS paint.
---
I'd love Gatherer and Auctioneer, also improving UI like ElvUI/pfUI.
---
I remember most raids were made up mostly of cliques who were willing to work together to raid.  I wasn't friends with the other 50 people in my guild, I was friends with maybe 8-10 of them.
---
&gt;Personally I used to not enjoy levelling through BC content that much, but only because you're forced to go through Hellfire Peninsula with every character
---
When TBC first hit I skipped hellfire penninsula entirely and started questing in Zangarmarsh immediately after crossing the portal. I did this to avoid the zerg, but you could also do it to avoid the zone if you don't like it.
---
It's a joke.
---
If you are talking about the warrior in Raid warning he says lol at the end, clearly showing he is joking and just trying to fuck with them.
---
You need level 50 for Divine Shield rank 2.
---
Ill put a vote out for Paladin just because of my personal experience all those year ago in vanilla.
---
I had a good friend named Berdrilice (if your out there from Eldre Thalas Alliance hit me up dude) who was a prot/holy hybrid build if I remember correctly. He would constantly run lower level alts and friends in the guild through stuff like SM and whatever else. If being able to solo lower level dungeons to help friends interests you then Pally is the way to go as Priest isn’t a strong solo class
---
&gt; Lets not pretend we could have stopped a legion invasion without player character immunity.
---
What's the point of any story if you shoot down events as 'plot armor' or whatever. 
---
They've tried to send the entire legion, several times, but were unable to do so because the inhabitants of Azeroth are so powerful and killed their leader/stopped the portals.
---
Don't worry you have a few months before PvP gives honor. Players killing players is not gonna cost you much time in phase 1. 
---
Common sense rules like keep some distance and leave if someone powerfull shows up means you can get to lvl 60 with as low as 10 pvp encounters. Track humanoid is a super power btw.
---
Inb4 pserver community vehemently defends their 30 min black lotus respawn timer. 99% ACCURATE THEY SAY. LMAO.

Tauren Druid
---
I'm not gonna dive into it.. but Priests are typically good at healing groups while Paladin's excel at single target healing.  As for World PVP, I'm much more afraid (as a Mage) of any spec of Paladin versus any spec of Priest.  If the player knows how to play the Pally, they just are hard af to kill.
---
&gt;And in the situation I was in where the tank was an idiot, the tank had lead. And there was no mechanism available in game to vote a party member out
---
If you are stupid enough to stay in the group with a tank that is so bad the group you cannot handle anything he pulls I have no sympathy.
---
Shaman dual-wielding. It's what made enhancement semi-viable in TBC
---
Not really being able to solo queue for bgs without being steamrolled by premade after premade. Maybe official servers will be different.
---
Done, he's been removed. Sorry about that!
---
I plan on rolling mage but i also mained warrior in vanilla and had a 60 lock.  i know at some point i am going to see warriors tanking and topping dps or raping faces in pvp or seeing locks provide that awesome utility and solid dps then im going to want to make one.  However, i also know if i was a war/lock i would look at a mage dps/utility/pvp and want that so i have to constantly remind myself to stay focused on 1 because the grass isnt always greener

Man I hope we get something today.

Oh I see what you were saying. The Corrupted Ashbringer was an item that dropped in Naxx. It was a Epic quality item. Some players at the time data-mined and I think they found evidence that an uncorrupted legendary quality Ashbringer existed. It was speculated that if you got the corrupted version you could eventually turn it into the legendary item, that however never came to pass and then BC was launched and maybe plans for that legendary item were scrapped.
---
The screenshot was taken in early january 2007.
---
You can dual wield even while leveling.
---
You just spec into arms and do the overpower build. 
---
If you end up getting VC swords and are DW at 20 you will be a monster, yes better then 2h Fury, for a while.
---
Eventually 2h gets better, and normally is slightly better, but dual wield with arms/overpower is very viable/similar. 
---
It works in that overpower procs when you get dodged and you are always being dodged so you can use it on CD.
---
It’s extremely easy specially if you’re questing a lone. I was questing in loch modan and invited a rogue to my group that was in the same area I was and we ended up questing together for around 2 hours. Without the help some of the quests would have been extremely difficult and taken much longer.
---
Where would you put it? Unless you put the mana efficiency talent deep at the bottom of the tree then resto druids will get the talent. And since nobody PvP's as moonkin it would not help Balance druids in PvP either.
---
Yeah today seemed like a good day for an update, but if we get a blue post it's usually up by 9-9:30 PST. Not getting my hopes up for any big news today :(
---
I suppose that makes sense when you're already 60 at launch, any characters levelled after then could be 58(?) heading in
---
This is incorrect the 4 days and 20h was on a fresh server around midway thru vanilla. I was on the server that the record was set and he hit 60 within a week of the server being launched.
---
The hours spent farming for consumes over the whole course of raid progression.
---
Also thats fine, I will be adamant on avoiding streamer servers as well, but I just dont like when people shit talk other people for being 100% normal in their community.... Like this post pulls a video of soda out of context and then shit talks him when he in all reality didn't do anything wrong.  
---
If a guild recruits under the loot system "corrupt loot council" and people join them and raid with them. Is it the guilds fault they are corrupt or the rando-raiders that let them... Lol, thats my biggest point.   
---
Also make sure to read my edit about how transmog/achievements are not allowed on project 70 rules so they would be blacklisted from project 70 if they used/actively participated in those.
---
I don’t even care if it takes longer, I have nothing better to do 🤷🏻‍♂️

Ah thank you for the info.

only having like 15 quests in your questlog? yeah
---
gotta agree with you there. any zone that you're forced through will end up being disliked eventually regardless of the actual quality of the zone. that's why even if howling fjord is one of the best zones in the game for me i get burnt out on it so quick, same with vashjir and hyjal, and boring tundra. i really like jade forest but i often find myself wishing i could just start somewhere else, especially since if you finish the storyline you outlevel pandaria.
---
The guild &lt;Guild&gt; is listed as Alliance, It is infact Horde (I am a member).
---
I realise that crowd pummelers are pretty Important for tanking and dps especially on progression, but I've also heard wardens staff and the mace from aq are very good options, and even the mace from dm.
---
I have a feeling having any of those items will be proficient for clearing raids. How accurate is this?
---
I find it hard to believe that I'll need need to farm 10+ pummelers to tank/dps efficiently, and that they will be used more when necessary rather than all the time.
---
I hated pickpocket runs. Super tedious and the chance to fail made it frustrating (especially when vanish is already down). Couldn’t recommend a different option enough.

This subreddit has a horde of people downvoting everything they dont like, no matter how factually correct it is. My advice is to just ignore the upvotes and downvotes on a post and instead only consider the content of the post itself and fact check.

So, out of the million possible configurations, this happens to be a raid where:
---
-All players agree to not care about transmog and achievements while doing a level 70 raid dungeon
---
-All players agree to loot rules based specifically on some strange level 70 "literal a joke" loot upgrades that also "perfect their gear for their playstyle"
---
-Players who pretend to be upset about not getting items
---
-A streamer, who melts down, but that's "just his personality" so it's not real rage/despair, who is the primary recipient for items unless he does not desire them, who is profiting in real life from the entire insane enterprise
---
It is definitely fair to say that, in that incredible circumstance, there is no ninja looting. I fully retract my claim that the streamer is a ninja. It is, instead, something far worse than merely an item going to the wrong player. The ridiculous behavior of the players involved, from the streamer to his adoring fans, is something I want to avoid now more than ever. There is no way, shape, or form that my gameplay experience will ever be anything but eroded by having people like this streamer and his ilk on the server I play on. I don't want them in Trade Chat, in World PvP, PUGs, or anything else.
---
Ahh thanks for that. I have to do some more cleanup and I want to make a few more changes (Like add a reddit user/Discord User/Bnet account column), add some more discord links and verify all the thread links. When I was talking about doing this I actually got a base list from another Discord user (Es) and updated/modified it. I figured it was in a sharable state now and wanted to get this list out for people to use while I continue updating it.

Forsaken aren't evil by default, and Sylvanas wasn't evil until Cataclysm happened either.

Forsaken have their positive emotions dulled, and their negative emotions amplified, this gives them a predilection towards evil, but it is far from guaranteed, there's quite a few decent Forsaken NPCs around in Vanilla, and actually even more in BC thanks to Tranquilien.

As for trolls, consider this. When a male troll mage throws a frostbolt, it is the closest thing in WoW you can get to a hadouken, similarly, fireball really looks like a shakunetsu hadouken. This is why I play troll mage

Yeah, I’d totally be ok with them adding content to vanilla - as long as it’s content and not qol stuff from retail
---
I wrote together my story of reaching Rank 14 in the very first honor system.
---
In the original system you earned Honorable Kills which gave you Contribution Points based on the rank of the player you killed. I don’t remember exact numbers, but something like 140 for a rank 1 and 300 for a rank 14. All this CP you earned was pooled into a pot together with everyone else’s on the same server and faction. Finally, 2 am before reset, Standings were calculated against other players based on your personal % contributed to the pool and Rating Points were then given based on your standing for the week. These RP gave you the ranks. Originally Blizzard had intended for the ranks to be temporary. This meant that both the titles and the rewards were only usable as long as you kept the rank. They changed their mind on this though - you will see why. Also worth mentioning, killing innocent NPCs gave you dishonorable kills which took away directly from your rating points.
---
Anyway, I managed to reach rank 9 before battlegrounds came out. It was probably the most fun I’ve had in PvP in this game. No BGs and no arenas, just going out in the world and stirring up the horde ranks. You chose the circumstances for your battles yourself, no fighting for flags or bases. I had some incredibly epic experiences on the way to rank 10 while camping Kargath and other horde hotspots like the Zeppelins. One week Blizzard even held a realm wide competition where the players with the most HKs would be awarded a special, one-time only tabard. I didn't get it though, there was really a lot of competition that week. Here's the rogue on horde side who won their contest, that tabard he's wearing is so rare there's not even a feat of strength for it: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/characte...er/Teoh/simple
---
And here's me camping Kargath:
---
So far this system sounds pretty cool, right? 
---
Well, it could’ve been, if Blizzard hadn’t tuned it so harshly and if battlegrounds weren’t introduced. Unfortunately, rank 10 is also when the system started making itself noticeable. It was no longer possible to go at it alone. You absolutely needed good standings to be able to go higher. Getting a standing worse than 10 while at rank 10+ meant you didn’t make any progress, and might’ve even meant losing a rank. This is how it worked:
---
Rank 14 required 60000 Rating Points. With Standing 1 you got 13000, and you lost 20% every week. According to that formula, the 12th week you'd have 65136 Rating Points, so from rank 0 to 14 you had to be Standing 1 for 12 weeks in a row. Lower standings gave lower RP, so if you got a too low standing the 20% loss would outweigh the gain you did and put you back. Also of course the higher your rank, the bigger the 20% punishment so standing 1 isn't worth as much % of your bar on high ranks as it was on low ranks. If you're interested in reading closer, here's a link describing it in detail. We didn’t know any of this back then though. We didn’t even have a progress bar to the next level in the PvP panel. In other words you could log in at the same rank 3 weeks in a row and not know if you’re making progress or losing it. Though even after they added the rank progress bar in patch 1.6, it was still heart crushing to log in and find out you had actually LOST rank progress after playing for 18 hours a day for a week. So I’m not sure which way I preferred it. However, I ended up dreading opening the PvP tab when I logged in every Wednesday.
---
So at this time, if you didn’t already have a WSG team, it was time to go look for one. My team was composed of the highest ranked players on the server. We knew each other since before because of the notoriety associated with doing PvP at the time so it was only natural we teamed up when WSG was released. We found WSG a lot of fun, it was a fresh addition to an already amazing system, so we kept a premade going almost 24/7 since everyone was super motivated to go for Rank 14. I could log off in the evening and then log on in the morning to see my premade still playing.
---
After running the premade for a few weeks a few of our members stopped gaining ranks. Having the top 10 standings for some reason wasn’t enough. They were all stuck at rank 11 without making any progress at all so we started being super strict on standings every week with everyone finishing in the same order before each reset to make sure everyone gains at least a little. We figured this was the only way you could achieve any progress in this system at high ranks. This is where it really turned into a grind. Knowing which standing you’d get took away a lot of the excitement of the system. It worked however, and they started gaining about 10-20% of their rank per week. Not a lot, but at least they didn’t lose progress and they’d eventually gain more as us top players would stop once we were done.
---
At the same time, WSG was turning into quite a pain. Not having a deserter system back then, the game let our opponents leave the BG instantly when they saw it was a premade. This resulted in our entire days being spent trying to cap 3 flags before the 5 minutes of 0 enemy players are up. How fun does that sound? I could go entire days without a single HK and still get good progress towards rank 14. Now it’s not even PvP anymore, it’s just rogues with rocket boots and preparation running flags from one room to another. Add to that 45 minute queues and having to travel to Ashenvale to queue. Missing queue was also out of the question if you wanted to keep your rank. To remedy this situation we started hunting horde in Felwood and Azshara between games since they were relatively close. It was the only way we’d get to do some actual PvP.
---
So there we were running a BG we absolutely hated for way too many hours a day, in a system that was vastly underrewarding. But circumstances being what they were, I was still happy to make progress myself as I was lucky enough to be getting Standing 1. However, we soon discovered the absolute most disheartening thing about this system…
---
Because of flaws in the system design it was impossible for more than 3 people at a time to compete for rank 12-13-14. There was a complete wall at rank 13 because you couldn’t move forward past it without Standing 1. And at least 4 weeks were needed r13-14. That meant you needed to guard your standing to the teeth every waking second for a month. If you for some reason got Standing 2, the system gave you the finger and put you back at around rank 12 +50%.
---
This happened to me once during my grind. As I said we implemented a system where everyone had set standings within our premade. I started with the highest rank, so I was chosen to be the first Rank 14. This meant I had to keep Standing 1 for 5 weeks total because I started at rank 12 +50%. The first 3 weeks this was no problem, our premade managed to sort standings fine every week. But week 4 something happened. A bug removed a whole day of my CP the day before reset and there was no way for me to catch up. The result of that was that I got standing 2, though only by a few thousand points despite my 24 hour straight attempt to catch up it didn’t matter because if you get standing 2, you don’t deserve rank 14. This put me from rank 13 +80% to rank 12+50% AGAIN. I lost 4 weeks of playing 18 hours a day, or 504 hours spent doing WSG. I almost burst into tears when customer support couldn’t help us.
---
After that I seriously lost my spirit. I could not handle another month of WSG. I decided to abandon my team and go at it on my own. They were completely fine with my decision. There was already absolutely no reason for them to play anymore. They hadn’t been making any noteworthy progress for a long time and all of them were stuck at rank 11 because of the artificial limit of 3 people at rank 12+. So they all quit the game, because without the premade there was just no way they'd be able to control standings and even keep rank 11. This was horrible to see. It all really didn’t matter for me though in the end as long as I got the title. So I spent 5 more weeks just doing Alterac Valley solo, camping the horde entrance for 1v1 battles. It worked and I managed to get standing 1 easily since no one in my premade played anymore. There was suddenly no competition for the title, because in this old system your own team was the biggest opponent, not the horde. So with my team gone from the game, it suddenly became fun again. No pressure, just logging in and doing some fun PvP and then getting ranked at the end of the week. 
---
5 weeks later I logged in to find myself at rank 14. 
---
It was finally over. I had never wanted anything so much in a game and seeing Grand Marshal in front of my name almost made me pass out. Note the old rank 12/13 set placeholder. They hadn’t even finished the textures for the stuff back when we were battling this insane system. I think that says a lot. After reaching rank 14 I completely stopped PvPing. I didn’t ever join a battleground again. Still to this day I can’t join WSG without getting anxiety. Maybe this wouldn’t have been the case if Blizzard would have tuned the system properly before people starting reaching those ranks. I think they didn't even realize until they saw us struggling, because when I saw this change in patch 1.8 notes, I think not many people actually understood it:
---
Patch 1.8.0 (10-Oct-2005):  The percentage of players that may reach ranks 6 through 14 has been increased.
---
With this change you could even have multiple rank 14’s at once. Some servers had 3 on the same faction. It completely altered the system and I do not see the post nerf system as the same grind. Rank 14 after that was hard, sure, but it was a LOT more accessible. It did not punish you back to square one unless you were outside the top 10. Standing 2-5 actually gained you progress at r13+ now and standing &lt;50 was enough for rank 11. Also account sharing started getting huge at this point, with multiple players playing the

Do you mean Kruul? He raided all the major cities prior to the release of BC.

I'm not looking forward to having only the option of holding Shift to auto-loot, unless they're adding a toggle to have it automatically.

one thing to consider is that the turning cloth quest isnt arround untill patch 1.4 AKA phase 2 when the original 100% speed mounts will be removed

Highly doubt this works though. If I remember correctly. It doesnt work with PoM + teleport/portal/hearthstone.

Straw man. Knowledgeable members of the pserver community should know that dynamic respawns were a conscious decision by Nost/LH admins to deviate from Blizzlike to accommodate the larger population. Changes like this were made over the years for sound reasons. You paint with too broad a brush.

I mean, I fully agree with you. Fuck streamer servers, they are literal cancer.

But yeah, this is a very specific set of circumstances that are pulled out of context to make soda look like a ninja... Hes not... Hes toxic as fuck, sure, yeah I agree whole-heartedly.

Anyway, I look back at these days now and I get mixed feelings. On one side it was extremely competetive, challenging and honestly FUN, but the backside of being ranked against your own team (especially with this broken algorithm) was just way too overwhelming. One thing is sure, it is the single most hardcore grind one could ever do in WoW.

You might get a higher parse on the horde side but threat is so much less of an issue for alliance it is a massive advantage in so many fights.

When he says "high unarmed" he's referring to the weapon skill "unarmed". In vanilla your character had a skill level for each weapon. It would increase a little bit every so often when you used a weapon of that type in combat until it reached the cap. The "Unarmed" weapon skill applies whether you are using fist weapons or nothing at all.
---
TLDR: He spent a lot of time in combat either unarmed or using fist weapons.

The only other debuffs it would push off are really low-prio stuff like deep wounds. SWP literally cannot push off sunders or curses.

I’m not so sure.  Why continue when you already done it. The last of the big raids.  I’m pretty sure nax will burn out ppl.

How long is Phase 1 and how long is Phase 2?

Oh I definitely agree, my comment is in reference to locks putting all their dots on the main target as the group burns that target down, which is the natural new player thing to do really, but is super shitty dps. 
---
I definitely welcome locks throwing up dots on secondary targets, that's good gameplay.
---
Okay so what's a cheeky tipple? I'm afraid to google that at work
---
Mana isnt actually that big of a hurdle tbh. You can deal with it using judgement, shadow oils (procs jow) and other tricks.
---
The real issue the complete lack of itemization, no taunt (people downplay this but its a HUGE problem at times) and generally pretty poor threat coming from the fact that you can get either defensive gear OR threat gear (spellpower). You cannot get both offensive and defensive stats on the same items like Warriors and Druids can.

Thank you for the clarification. I am glad we are in agreement on this topic.
---
The one with Mankrik’s wife?  R.I.P. in peace.
---
Short answer: You don't need pummelers.
---
Long answer: do they increase your Threat/DPS? - yes quite significant and yet you can still do both of those roles easily without. If you wanna go mim/max or tryhard once in a while get a few pummelers.
---
My favorite zone... pick up every quest then just go in a giant circle doing them all.
---
No problem lol. Im glad we are as well
---
Yeah. I know what you meant and agree. Sorry if it seemed like I was disagreeing.
---
I just also see people attacking locks for casting dots in dungeons while leveling and it's dumb. As long as they do it right I'm happy.
---
Nature lovers.
---
Considers a class that run around killing everything with a gun/bow.
---
Hmm.
---
Any loot system can work as long as all the members agree to it before hand. For best guild progression, generally Loot council will come out on top as you need to gear tanks and your best DPS first.
---
way less than 3 hours lol
---
just don’t turn up 👍
---
Okay.
---
5x16 is a lot of space anyway. You really shouldnt have to worry about bag space after you get at least some Runecloth Bags, which you can easily farm mats for when you get to level 50.
---
Yeah sorry, I missed on this
---
They had to cater to the casuals or else they would take a huge sub hit. Cata pre-nerf was some of the most fun i've had in WoW in a long time. Even the first tier of raids were amazing.
---
I basically throw corruption and wand regardless. Coa and siphon if they are going to at least get through half their duration so longer than 15 seconds.
---
New job the year of wow classic? Whoops! I'd probably left this job this summer, but that accrued vacation time is up utmost importance right now.
---
Put it in the Moonkin form?
---
What's their issues in PvP?
---
Drink
---
If the raid is fun, then raid. Otherwise go PvP or unsub. Some people will leave when they see KT dead but I don't think many will. Naxx is one of the most fun and best designed raids ever. It's a perfect blend of TBC style mechanics and crazy vanilla whacko mechanics.
---
Laughes in rage
---
Haha. That must be a popular name. I was on a pserver playing my little orc in stonetalon mountains when out of no where  (like a bad RKO) came a high level alliance player named IGankLowbies. He corpse camped me for over 30 minutes, so I logged out. I never actually logged back in. Not worth playing when you have to deal with that shit. 
---
PvE server for life.
---
Waiting hours to get into BGs, only to get steamrolled by pve gear premades in good gear
---
Nice but would be cool to be able to filter a little better - For example I only wanna look at US/NA (Maybe make those 1 category too), Alliance, and Hardcore. I'm sure some people wanna look by Raid Time too.
---
So can I raise that by afking in front of a training dummy on day 1 to avoid fighting for mobs, or does it have to be against a mob?
---
Alsways love to do that in as many regions as possible. :3
---
During TBC it was generally considered best to go to Outlands at level 58 when leveling alts. Buuuuuut... If you hate hellfire peninsula enough you could always just get to 60 or 61 in vanilla zones and still skip it.
---
So no excuses!
---
LC is the best if you can keep it unbiased and focused on the good of the guild.
---
The bot if i had the choice back then.
---
My favorite zone has always been TBC's Nagrand. Plenty of quests, PvP, and easy on the eyes.
---
The levels spent questing through STV are some of the best times in the whole game.

I'm more worried about the lower level dungeons. Like Deadmines. As a lot of new and returning players won't remember how aggro works properly. It's going to be a shot show.
---
&gt; Aux , Lazypig, ModUI, RDX, Cartographer, Questie, Trinket Menu, KLH, Omni CC, Grid, Luna's , Gatherer
---
Do you think those are a reasonable request for launch ports?
---
That I don't know. I don't even remember if Vanilla wow had training dummies.
---
Lmao how is that legal
---
It sounds like you're assuming the worst possible scenario,  which may very well happen.  But it's a risk worth taking. Leveling is temporary, you'll get past it.
---
The poor ratio of raid size to boss loot. 40 is a lot.
---
Dont let these people just say loot council with no explanation.
---
I am not a fan of loot council because it is the easiest to abuse.  I think dkp/epgp with oversight is best.
---
Yeah the 4 mech boss was a creative encounter.
---
In app purchases lol
---
I hope Ackis Recipe List is functional. I love collecting all the recipes
---
I just read this system on Battle.net forums.   
---
40 raiders VOTE for what CLASS the item goes to.   
---
The Class Members must decide who gets it.   
---
Each class group will come up with their own group.   
---
Stay away from LC. The chances of it NOT killing your guild is low.   
---
DKP.  
---
Suicide Kings.  
---
Vote system.  
---
These have a higher chance of keeping your guild together.
---
Downboat bombing all the loot council comments doesn’t make them less valid.
---
I've been in and ran guilds that used dkp, rolls, epgp and loot council.  The only common theme between all these systems is people will still find something to bitch about when they don't get what they want.
---
Okay this is awesome to hear, and exactly how I was hoping it would be. Thanks for the insight, I'm almost positively playing feral now!
---
Won't work on classic. Honor won't be out till phase 2 where most of us will be past lvl 40.
---
Fortis brought Kazzak to Stormwind on Kel'Thuzad.  It was glorious.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LyIOigL7Gg
---
A lot of the info is incorrect.  I can't tell you what all is incorrect, but as someone looking for a specific guild type (NA/Horde/PVE/DKP) I saw at least two guilds listed as PvE  are actually rolling on a pvp server (free hugs &amp; cerberus).
---
Having your life in such shambles that you are capable of taking part in farming Naxx.
---
Elitist players. They drive me nuts. They suck the fun out of the game.
---
Same bud :/
---
If the guild is not hardcore then LC isnt necessary.  No matter how hard you try to mitigate abuse the most favored will get the most sought after items
---
Making accusations doesn't make you correct.
---
Old, but relevant, [blue](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-customer-service/103879.htm) post on the subject.
---
Not blizzlike!!!
---
i am desperate for an addon that reads the quest text to me so that i can still get the lore while leveling like a bat out of hell. does this even exist?
---
Depends on how many alts you'll be leveling. Keep in mind, if any alts will be doing any gathering, you'll need them at 40+ and have to pay for mounts, so it's nice to consider Warlocks for that role for the free mount. For the crafting alt, he can be anyone that just sits in the main city and handles all of your AH stuff as well. I wouldn't worry too much about the speed to level 35 as it'll be insignificant in the long run, but go with a Hunter if that's your primary concern.
---
What did he say? He deleted both of his comments
---
Catch a really bad stomach virus
---
Well if the API is the same (I don't know about the details) then these all have existing, working addons we could just pull from. 
---
Of those I listed, RDX is the most complex and I would be surprised if it was ported over given that the developer long abandoned it.
---
there's one quest (tremors of the earth) where you have to kill two elite drakes
---
i think it's less visually interesting than say, hellfire peninsula or netherstorm. but i think its true strength lies in the fact that its sandwiched between zones like that which are obviously broken and otherworldly, so getting to this peaceful and beautiful zone in the midst of all this chaos is awesome and makes it really stand out. the quests are really good too, i feel. good choice!
---
Hi there. I’m an officer in a pserver wow guild and I work hard to persuade my raiders that loot council is the gold standard for all progression guilds. So let me join the chorus of other such beneficiaries of this system in saying that yes, indeed, Loot Council is the only viable method of loot distribution for the best and hardest core guilds out there. You can trust me on this. Also my guild is now recruiting but all Loot Council positions are filled at the moment.
---
The first person complaining unironically that ret isn't a viable spec is gonna kill me a little inside.
---
Hoping for 40-man raids of level 30-somethings taking a break from leveling to go berserk in STV. Did this on Nost and had something insane like 400 HKs in an hour or so.
---
Laughs in 33 days annual holiday
---
First thing I thought when I came into this thread. I don't think people remember how absolutely atrocious some graveyard placements were relative to questing areas. Thousand Needles ... ugh.
---
&gt; i am desperate for an addon that reads the quest text    
---
Im sure this is possible. All of the text in game is already written,    
---
WHO IS WILLING TO VOICE ACT 1000000 lines of text?   Someone? Please?
---
the land of the free... after one year
---
Cancer got him.
---
That’s the discount for rep not honor I believe.
---
Sounds pretty normal for union jobs
---
Especially since you can’t really dungeon til your almost 20.
---
That's good to hear! I am definitely worried that classic will take on the retail attitude of gearscore / meta builds over all else, and if that's the case I'd like to at least be prepared to have something meta for raiding.
---
I think Humans are more for PvE. Their weapon skill has a big impact there. Perception is cool but it's not going to save your life or anything. Rogues and Druids are more likely to CC you than kill you. Dwarf seems like the way to go.
---
Tanks are absolutely fine to play on a casual schedule for all things except hardcore guild based raiding.  I’d actually argue it’s favorable as you’ll be able to find PvE groups extremely quickly, where as it can sometimes take quite a while as a DPS player.
---
Healers experience this as well, just to a slightly lesser degree.  I’d say you can actually raid as a casual healer though too, as raids are almost always in need of more healers.
---
I was told the faction leaders do give a good amount of honor. DKs are what keep people from doing that.
---
I found the guy from someone advertising WoW Radio in General Chat. It was a friday and Slanik was doing his show. I listened to it and liked it, so I checked their schedule and Blue Plz was on Saturday.
---
I was a massive fan after listening to that first show.
---
Honestly, if you're running it at-level, deadmines can be one of the harder instances. It's pretty easy to pull too many trash mobs, and at that point many players don't have fully fleshed out spellbooks. Post 20 you start to get all the tools you need to deal with it, but we typically started running VC before that.
---
+1 (this guy gets it)
---
Lol you're right I misread :P
---
If you got an honorable, consistent and active core crew - Loot council. 
---
But its extremely hard to find sucha core thats reliant so DKP is fair.
---
Also, so sorry to bother you again. We moved our app over to our website that we made recently. https://boaf.enjin.com/recruitment
---
Sorry again.
---
It'd be interesting if they did a patch adding Kara then. Really, it probably wouldn't be too much effort since everything is already designed, just needs to be scaled for 60.
---
I'll reserve my character names on multiple servers and level a warlock to the 40s in the first few days. I'll only have 5 free days so I highly doubt I can get to 60 or even 50 knowing how fast I've leveled in the past. After that it'll probably take me 3 more weeks to hit 60.
---
I love the positivity of this post, and I’m not trying to gatekeep or flex any elitism. At least when I played, Timewalking dungeons were super easy. Sure, it scales down your gear, but mechanically, the game still operates like modern WOW. 
---
But still, timewalking is one of the cooler features of modern WoW. It was an exciting piece of fun when it came out, but they didn’t stay fun after I realized that even Wrath dungeons used to be harder. Not to mention Black Temple. Some groups would wipe a lot on Illidan, I admit, but people had no idea what they were doing and would plow through at ultra speed.
---
The leveling to 60. I hate it at this point. Ive done it too many times..(not saying ive ever liked it). But its worth going through! So many fun things at 60
---
&gt; 40 raiders VOTE for what CLASS the item goes to.
---
So hunters are now supposed to know what gear priority priests and paladins have in order to vote for which gets a chance at that healing item?
---
You misspelled "worst".
---
Is there ANYTHING that isn't against the law in the EU these days?
---
PvP servers aren't that bad once everything simmers out to be honest.
---
Vanilla World PvP is some of my greatest memories from my childhood. I had so much fun sitting in ventrilo with my friends/guild starting guild wars outside of MC.
---
Sure, I was just pointing out that a BiS weapon for warriors (and debatably sword rogues) does come from the first raid tier :)
---
It's just something hard to imagine outside the US
---
Dwarf is such a good race in general. As a hunter it is hard for me not to make one. No pallies, no priests stone forming out of viper sting. 
---
Then again I find the hybrid intimidation scatter build more viable for orc. Hardiness takes some of the sting out of losing deterfence/counterattack vs melee
---
well google actually has a great text to speech api i was thinking could work well
---
Paladins are the most efficient healers. They spam flash of light and spot heal the raid. They're often top of the meter because they're just faster to the heal than anyone else.
---
Priests are more dynamic to play as you'll be dealing with more healing options and downranking. As Alliance, you'll also have some very nice utility assuming you're a dwarf.
---
The two classes complemnt each other well and 40-man raids will look to have 4-6 of each.
---
For PvP, Spriests are largely considered the best dualers in the game. Paladins are virtually impossible to kill and also can team up with warriros for the best pvp duo.
---
  **"Blizzard please announce release date I need to use my work vacation time"** 
---
this but unsarcastically.
---
We gonna be prepared for this now
---
Druid by far
---
You're right. When I typed that I forgot thunderfury was a thing, I was only thinking of dps weapons
---
&gt; and your best DPS first
---
But why not gear the lower DPS? A rising tide lifts all ships. There's obviously a balance needed, but if a drop improves your best DPS by 50DPS, but a lower geared by 75, give it to the lower one.
---
If any class is pigeonholed into a certain role it definitely is NOT Warrior. All 3 specs are viable and competitive.
---
I trust the results of a 40 man vote than a secret 5 man officer LC chat.
---
My crystal ball says its to fuck with peoples vacation requests.
---
Consumables don't just appear from the aether. The gold from token sales does not either. Frankly, i will be buying gold from a friend who plays mage and has more free time then I do. If the token exists in Classic it won't impact me either way.
---
Play with a more transparent group of officers.
---
Extremely overpopulated start areas. Nothing breaks immersion like 49 players all frantically trying to click the same respawning quest item.
---
Farming for consumes and enchants.
---
&gt;kites a Nightmare Dragon to Org
---
Us too, Mieze.
---
Pyroblast is my favorite on retail but I don't think I'll enjoy vanilla fire mage so I'm gonna go with chain heal on a healing shaman
---
I did a remind me. And it didn't happen. Maybe there should be a rule against this that results in ban.
---

---
Well yes. But like pally, druid, shaman are due to vanillas design philosophy. It's a shame the game didn't really embrace actual support/hybrids.
---
DKP with weekly decay seems to make the most sense to me.  
---
Is there an addon that automates the **entire** DKP process??
---
"INACCURACY" LUL
---
Lies and slander!
---
Fixed this today, cheers!
---
Hate to break it to you... At least in retail, Alliance is the underdog with population wise. It probably will be the same.
---
A princess fit for a Disney movie.
---
If you are a player that needs 50g respecs, you will find the coin.
---
No, its a necessary gold sink.  You can farm up that hundred gold in 2-5 hours.
---
Fixed this today.
---
I used to just respec once. I’d have a build for leveling and then I’d respec into something i’d be happy with in both pve and pvp. Obviously if you wanna max out your potential in just raiding or pvp then this won’t work for you.
---
Yup. The true answer is a pseudo loot council and DKP/EPGP.
---
Essentially, the loot council is there to make sure the main tank gets everything that they need and all the main healers get geared. You don’t want someone coming in, saving up DKP for the T2 Onyxia helm that the tank clearly deserves more.
---
The trick is to be EXTREMELY open with the raid and give good reason to why certain characters deserve gear.
---
Honestly not all that much. I'd say trying to quest and getting rekt by mobs and players for hours on end, but that's really one of the core parts of the game which made it what it is/was.
---
I think personalized loot spoiled me. I can just imagine running around in the Barrens then coming across the sprinting elite zhevra or the rare devilsaur. If I don't have a group ready to kill it, someone else will get the loot.
---
So really, just missing out on potential loot while roaming around.
---
Fixed acherus/SW/durotar and dalaran today. Should be up to date now :)
---
1) Vanilla felt like you were actually part of a living world. In Cataclysm and the xpacs that followed the game felt more like a collection of minigames that you would teleport to. Post-cata wow was almost entirely focused on rushing to max level and then raiding.
---
Vanilla wow was expertly designed to gently nudge strangers into working together to solve problems. It was a fantastically efficient engine for creating and maintaining friendships. Post-cata wow does everything in it's power to make interpersonal reaction unnecessary. They even added a private instance you could hide in and never talk to anyone!
---
The storylines in vanilla are small and functionally self-contained but have threads that tie them together. That way you can do or skip whichever ones you want to craft your own story for your character. This is fitting for an MMO. The storylines in post-cata wow are one long chain that you have no control over whatsoever. This is more fitting for a first person shooter, but they crammed it into wow for some reason.
---
The list goes on and on. I could type until my fingers bleed, but I'll just stick with these three.
---
2) All classes are easy to play to an effective level, but some are more difficult to master. Just pick the one you think looks coolest. In my opinion the most important thing to do if this is your first go at it is to not rush to 60 and not try to minmax anything. Just play the friggin game. Casual levelers used to make up a solid majority of players in vanilla and it sucks that post-cata wow left them with nothing to do.
---
3) They're both just fine. Honestly it's pretty darn balanced by patch 1.12. Any differences are minor. Unless your irl friends already have a faction in mind you should just pick the one you think looks coolest. 
---
4) Un'goro is one of my favorite leveling zones just because it has the same Safari feel too it as STV, but without constantly getting murdered by lvl60 rogues. Blackrock Depths is the best dungeon. That's not an opinion, that's just a fact. This guy explains it better than I can: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a43GUqzOLs
---
5) Eleven.
---
Mistake. Fixed this today.
---
check your pms
---
On my server not a single guild even finished naxx before BC. Being on a server with a guild that had Naxx on farm was rare. Being in the guild farming was rarer. Being the person that guild is farming the staff FOR and completing it in time? Ridiculously rare.
---
LC only works consistently over time for extremely high end, extremely organized guilds like Method.
---
All loot systems have issues, and IMO which one is suitable for your guild depends on both the personalities in your guild and what type of guild you have.
---
For example, a casual guild with a bunch of friends might want to just operate on a soft-res system like many pserv pugs do (I actually like this system in a friendly casual guild). However a guild that's trying to progress might get more mileage out of EPGP, and say a guild where you aren't a bunch of close friends...hardcore or not....might benefit more from something like zero-sum DKP or suicide kings.
---
I fixed this today. No longer showing harbor.
---
Fixed 16th April, thanks. No more DK starting area.
---
You started this shit by trolling, I told you in my messages you creep.
---
It was, I spent so much time trying to do it before reading more and finding out it was patched
---
I am calling it now:
---
People will flood the limited amount of servers, it will become almost impossible to log in as Blizzard "Did not expect it" (Right...) and it's going to be unplayable for the first week.
---
Insert the people that are crying about not being able to play despite taking off a week from work for it.
---
One might think that the previous launches might have taught them a lesson.
---
Homie this is a weird hill to die on. There will be kiting or people will throw a fit....and then there will be kiting.
---
Closet Classic WoW fan. He's so closeted that he doesn't even know he's in the closet. #Narnia
---
While I actually *love* the idea of this system...I feel like it would make loot take six hundred years every boss....
---
I agree.. interesting points though.  I believe the spellpower coefficients for both seal of righteousness, JoR, and consecrate are all pretty awful.  So I imagine a bunch of sp gear doesn't help a ton.  I made a prot pally in only preraid stuff on the instant 60 pserv and mostly geared for stam/int/def where I could.  Of course no pieces have those 3 together but mix/match you could get a decent collection together with 4500k hp, 4k+ mana and well-progressed towards the defense cap with very high armor. 
---
I know it's 'suboptimal' but I like to kind of base the playability of something off of minimal consumes or other abilities.  I'm not really interested in farming for a couple hours to then play my class for 30 minutes-60 in a group environment.
---
I think they mean the highest skilled first
---
If they're going for "no changes", it'll work fine up until the TBC patch. There's lots more information throughout the rest of this page.
---
I did pvp in retail and would love to return. However,  I will now have less time to play and would like to make the most of it.  Also, all my irl friends are doing pve so I don't really have a choice.
---
Yes pls. Give app/addon!
---
I deleted all my PMS there were too many. Why am I a creep haha.
---
Real women have curves
---
Modern wow is more fun with shit gear, sadly. Those first weeks on a fresh expansion are actually fun. If you keep that pace and go straight into Mythic raiding it stays fun. But if you fall of the progression wagon for a minute you have a tough time catching up.
---
And I dont mean in Ilvl, I mean in fun. Walking into 5 mans in leveling blues and taking on Mythics is fun. nearly dying all the time and needing to play perfect to survive is fun. I could play at that difficulty all day. Running through 5 mans 4 weeks later in meaningless epics chain pulling and tanking as a spriest isnt. 
---
But because the community has an unhealthy obsession with min/maxing (humorously those who rant most about min/maxing in pug content tend to not be Mythic raiders--where min maxing is needed) if your ilvl isnt 98th percentile you dont get invited to under end M+ which makes the content you can get invited to boring and easy which makes you quit and unsub.
---
I still remember trying to heal my group the first time we fought her. Ran out of mana healing the dumb DPS. Next attempt it was heals for the tank only!
---
The DPS had to learn sooner or later.
---
Graphics
---
Yea the filters don't carry over in view only, however if you go to Data --&gt; filter view you can add your own temporary filter to do just that
---
Druid, no one else has a nature sanctuary they can teleport to any time. Shaman control the elements they don’t harmonize with them.
---
Once you figure out a reliable gold farming method for your class &amp; server circumstances, it's not too bad. I stayed at the 50g cap for at least a year, bouncing between SM/Ruin for raids and SM/DS for farming at least once a week.
---
Sameeeeeeeeeee
---
&gt;KA-CHOW!
---
&gt;What's poppin' fellow Classics? It's your boy, OPH, back at it again
---
I thought I was watching a Youtube video for a second.
---
I'll have only this one alt with Alchemy and Tailoring (for Mooncloth and bags). My main will have Herbalism and Engineering.
---
Event?

“And it only took around 18,000 boar kills”.    :/

Cool idea. 
---
Some comments (feel free to ignore): 
---
Barrens - [Serengeti](https://ajabu-adventures.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/elephants-herd-landscape-serengeti.jpg) feels way more obvious with the acacia trees and stuff. 
---
Thoradin's wall - [Hadrian's wall](https://www.britainexpress.com/images/attractions/editor3/Steel-Rigg-6914.jpg) feels like a more thematically correct comparison. But your picture specifically is definitely very similar. 
---
Twin Collosals - [Zhanghiajie National park](https://cache-graphicslib.viator.com/graphicslib/page-images/742x525/402553_Viator_Shutterstock_187291.jpg) is way closer imo. 
---
Azshara - I get the autumn thing you were going for, and this one is hard. But I would say something on the [northwestern US coast](https://www-vacasa.imgix.net/washington_coast_01_fSdlVZb.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ixlib=python-2.0.0&amp;q=45&amp;s=a60d9706537762f9f05347ceefd21263) feels more spiritually similar. I feel like the coastline of Azshara is more significant than the forest. 
---
Silithus - Obviously a fantasy landscape, but I would use something more extreme than your picture, like [death valley](https://npca.s3.amazonaws.com/images/8696/8d5006eb-116e-43ca-8c5f-9b376a78d152-banner.jpg?1445970301). Or maybe [the nubian desert](http://www.orangesmile.com/extreme/img/main/pyramids-nubian-desert_1.jpg), with some similar architecture to AQ.

Elwynn - I strongly disagree with your choice there, Elwynn is not wilderness at all, like yosemite. Any [western/central European forest](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Epping_Forest_Centenary_Walk_2_-_Sept_2008.jpg) would work fine, probably a lot of places in the US too. Don't have a great picture unfortunately. 
---
Loch Modan - actually like you not going for the obvious Scottish Loch, since most areas in WoW seem more inspired by American nature than anything else, despite the names. 
---
Tanaris - Why not go for the obvious, [Sahara](https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/CbIClo5udPTYyJzplStKQDQCVQs=/800x600/filters:no_upscale()/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/ee/54/ee546179-a222-470a-8f7e-147ca1adbcc6/42-56923287.jpg)? Australia isn't exactly known for sand dunes, but picture works fine I guess. 
---
Westfall - Should be some [American farmland](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/1-american-farmland-king-wu.jpg) or something, that is clearly the inspiration. 
---
Darkshore - Really, a landlocked country? haha. [Rialto beach, US](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53af9a22e4b07a4f01183ebd/t/5704285b45bf214b427b6ff1/1459890332938/Incredible+Vantage+Point.jpg) seems pretty much spot on to me.
---
Understood. It's a hard metric tho.
---
Why would you lie to people at r/freefolk ?
---
Mind control &gt; anything a paladin does in terms of fun gameplay.
---
I do. I do.
---
&gt; I feel like it would make loot take six hundred years every boss....
---
Um maybe, people dont want to waste time either, each class would/should already kinda know who would get the next loot.
---
The type of guild you are going to be running will dictate the type of loot distribution system you should use. 
---
Hardcore raid guild aiming for content clears asap? Loot council. 
---
Casual raiding guild? DKP / Suicide Kings / EPGP
---
Whatever system you pick, make sure it's set in stone and that all members of the guild understand it before attending raids. Personally, I like DKP with bidding because it's the most transparent, and the people with the best attendance / effort get first dibs on the items. It rewards the members who have been in the guild the longest.
---
unless u gonna farm A LOT like more than 10h a week then u are then better off farming as normal some mobs in epl or whatever
---
Having your life so well sorted out that you are capable of farming naxx*
---
Yes in vanilla it was ridiculously rare for a guild to clear naxx on any given server but with the increased knowledge and skill we will have it definitely will be more common.
---
The Alchemy transmute will require mining, unless the plan is to just purchase on the AH. Also, what will your main be?
---
Damn 50% drop, I had no idea.  WTF did they do?
---
Oh the stories about how to cleanse the Ashbringer... ppl thought there was a huge hidden questline, similiar to the scepter-quest for AQ and it was made believable since Blizz had made it so that stuff happened if you entered certain places with the Corrupted Ashbringer. Huge fun at the time
---
Basically everyone hates DHKs...they didn't solve the problem they set out to solve b/c the type of person that causes the problems DHKs were meant to solve doesn't CARE bout DHKs.....
---
Made fun of op for only being level 44 in vanilla.
---
I did this and with Precious as well (summons a demon that instagibs everything and is immune to everything). Needless to say, I got banned for a day or so. Completely worth it.
---
So tired of these sayings. Someone somewhere that gets on TV/lots of internet views must have said this recently. I remember 'pearl clutching' was really popular on Reddit for a while. 'Virtue signaling'. Etc. Why not try thinking for yourself every now and then instead of just parroting shit you hear/read elsewhere. 
---
It's not a hill and I'm not dying. I just think it's dumb to assume that all mechanics are going to work exactly the same. Or that if there is enough outcry it will be changed.   
---
Used to be (according to this sub) that Classic was just Activision making a cash grab. Every server was going to be fully sharded. There would be no phases or itemaztion. Etc. 
---
Now people like you are certain that they are going to do whatever the community says they want.
---
&gt; Is there an addon that automates the entire DKP process??
---
We'll need to make new addons for classic, pserver ones won't work.
---
I encourage you to read the Classic Discussion in the wow us forum.
---
Why two weeks though?
---
Why not a couple of days, or the same day?
---
I believe I'm right in saying they've tried to time large content patches with the same day of the launch of other MMO's stuff.
---
One of the big reasons i decided to go priest over warlock is that i dont feel like being a soul shard bitch.
---
Well, that and Dwarves can be priests, but not locks.
---
&gt; impossible to log in as Blizzard "Did not expect it"
---
Literally every expansion. It's Tradition at this point.
---
Yeah. I’ve often said if I could make ONE change to classic WoW, that would be my change. 
---
Basically, you either PvP in your PvE spec or you farm to pay for your reapecs between the two. It’s not a small bit of farming either if you’re doing it often. 
---
Yeah yeah I get it #nochanges and all, keep it authentic, and I agree. But authentic doesn’t mean I have to like it. I always thought 25g cap would be much more reasonable.
---
It keeps people from running around with cookiecutter specs and instead forces you to compromise. It increases diversity and its a good thing.
---
If you do the same thing with Precious (Hunter epic quest mob), it is almost equally hilarious. Spawns the Cleaner, a mob that is immune to physical dmg and 1 shots everything.
---
You should do separate posts for these, it's totally worth the "spam"!
---
Should have kept a look out at your surroundings and fought him off in 1v1 combat
---
Deserve is the wrong word.
---
Im really not looking forward to no maps in dungeons.
---
For some of them thats not really a big issue, but the big mazes are going to be rough.
---
First you have to have 40 people vote on which class gets the loot...then you have to have those classes figure out who gets the loot...
---
Like who has time for the warriors to duel in the middle of a raid AFTER 40 people have already had to take time to vote on them getting it in the first place.
---
I personally hope, that there wont be anything like DBM.
---
Ass kickings from Apex, Fortnite, Path of Exile, etc.
---
WoW Retail has been hemorrhaging players as of late also.
---
Yeah, that was the point. It's not hard to convince anyone that Alliance is better outside of world PvP.
---
You just lookin to squable ain'tcha?
---
It would be a good april fools prank lol
---
When it comes down to it, I’m not gonna let DHKs kill my guilds world pvp in cities. Wpvp &gt; DHKs /shrug
---
I'm in favor of reduced respec costs (halved is fine like some pservers have it.) Especially since healing and tank specs are generally more inconvenienced by higher respec costs. I feel, players in those roles would be more likely to continue playing if they could move more freely between specs. 
---
Although back in the day the high respec cost did lead to some interesting builds that made some concessions in the min/max dept in order to be viable in both.
---
I know your type. Youre difficult to work with at work.   
---
Im presenting an idea, and you wanna Negative Andy the idea.  
---
Thanks for your input. Let me know what server youre gonna be on so I can avoid.
---
Someone will undoubtedly make one, I just hope I am 60 before then so I dont feel compelled to use it to keep up with the leading edge of the pack.
---
Well, players that are more “dependable” than others. You don’t want to give good gear to someone that may be gone in the next two weeks.
---
Dependable is probably a better word.
---
This whole time I've been dead set on playing horde, but these passed couple days I've started questioning myself... now I dont know whether I want to play alliance or horde, I've played horse my whole life but maybe its time for a change? I dont have any friends to play with so I dont have any influence in that sense... I'll have to make a decision soon, why must this be so hard...
---
*laughs in life tap*
---
Sounds pretty spot-on to me. WSG was mostly PuG stomping. Not very glamorous. Majority of high rank players were not good players, just had a lot of free time to sink into BGs
---
MoveAnything, cast/swing timer bar, OmniCC
---
Threat and Damage meters would be nice. IF i can get Unit Frame/Action Bar mods I will also want a viewbox addon. 
---
What I really want is the old UI addon that did bars, ui elements and unit frames. I cant remember the name started with an F or D. But it was HIGHLY customizable. It went away with BC when similar less robust addons came out for just UF and just bars.
---
Oh so youuuu took the job at the Stockades!?
---
I have a mixed opinion on that.
---
Mages have so much damn utility that it's almost laughable. People have to keep in mind that Combat utility and Out of combat Utility -still- counts as Utility.
---
Mages can "create" the best food/drinks that exist, they can teleport around the world and create portals for others, they can put magic buff/debuffs on people which no one else can, they have CC, Interrupts and the best toolkit for aoe grinding/kiting.
---
Throw in one of the easiest rotations in the game and we are set.
---
The only real downside is the earlier mentioned rotation which can get quite boring, the mana (which goes for almost everyone) and the lack of defensives...which you counter with your insane toolkit.
---
Oh. Nice! These pictures look amazing! Good job
---
Yeah that RP event in SM when you had the Ashbringer was so cool.
---
I was a casual and a terrible player back then. I couldn't even kill Professor Putricide on normal difficulty. There's more to this story but it's irrelevant.  When I dinged 85 and began dungeoneering, one of the most elevating WoW experiences for me was learning HC tactics. Hell, when Rise of the Zandalari came out I ran those dungeons for fun despite not needing gear at one point.  It's a shame most other casuals weren't willing to get better as they missed out on such a personal gain.
---
&gt;You just lookin to squable ain'tcha?
---
Oh god. The harpies... The fucking harpies.
---
Holy shit, [Jatayu Earth's Center](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1920&amp;bih=904&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=jxm2XIGNPLW_0PEPgNmB0A4&amp;q=jatayu+earth%27s+center&amp;oq=jatayu+earth%27s+center&amp;gs_l=img.3...6006.6082..6162...0.0..0.100.100.0j1......0....1..gws-wiz-img.ZiddQm58jjk) is a real place! I thought that was a photoshop.
---
Its just a matter or time.
---
I remember an Alliance priest called James had it on my server. He did play 24/7 mind you.
---
Me as well. But there will be.   
---
My hope is that RP-PVP server guild will ask/tell to not use them.
---
Waiting for a release date...
---
Me too! I'd seen it on Reddit but I found out it was real and knew it would be perfect for aerie peak
---
Theres plenty of other reasons to keep logging in.  Goals you set for yourself, playing alts, etc.
---
Of course seeing as this guy literally started his post talking about this is the first time hes done something *other* than raid, im going to assume they keep logging in for raid, and they enjoy it.
---
Im going to take a wild guess and say that they may not enjoy M+ (thus the lack of 5m content they normally do), which honestly im with them on.  I rarely do M+, and despite it being challenging, its just not the same as the old 'take your time, its okay to wipe' dungeon runs of years past.
---
I had a troll mage all the way through BC. I had two friends that were undead mages. I was so envious. Strictly on looks and casting animation alone undead is years above troll. In addition, troll mounts are too bouncy and you get a headache after a while. Female troll is better. You will regret being a male troll.
---
I mean... do they even realize that they admit that they are dumb? They didn't expect it the first time... fair enough, but after the fourth time? come on.
---
What Blizzard is actually thinking: "Jesus, Lovestospooge, do you REALLY need to play this game 32 days straight with literally all of your saved up PST?"
---
See, that's where the term "casual" get's a bit blurred, I think. Even though you played casually, you still TRIED to get better. 
---
I think we need a term for the people who show up for a month and want all the purples for free and to have everything off easy street (what my original comment was pointing to.)
---
Vanilla had auto loot. You just had to use a shift modifier.
---
How did snowfall work? I was too stupid to figure it out when I was a kid.
---
*Laughs in unemployment
---
Deleted, what did it say?
---
Yeah. I'm not looking forward to not running Kara.
---
Hey! Love the times and philosophy.
---
I’m stuck at an odd impasse where I may level through multi boxing and then transfer characters to a single account. As long as I am an active participant on a single character, do you have any rules against multiboxing? I’m just trying to avoid repetitive leveling.
---
Thanks!
---
If cool weapons are that important to you warrior is 100% the way to go. BRE, ashkandi, dark edge, corrupted ashbringer and might of menethil are all super badass. Atiesh has a terrible model and if you really like shiny legendaries you can always go for sulfuras.
---
I love all these and a some of them I really considered. Halfway through I decided to focus more on the photos but your right that your ideas are more thematically correct
---
Because DPS doesn’t scale linearly with gear, but multiplicatively. Also, a hunter with his timing down on auto attacks / aimed shots and FD trinket swapping is going to get more DPS out of upgrades than low apm players. 
---
But to the first point, if you already have good gear and get an upgrade, it is going to bring more DPS to the raid then giving the upgrade to an undergeared raider, as the upgrade will scale with your higher crit, AP/SP, weapon, consumables, etc. 10% of 1000 is more than 10% of 500.
---
I mean, 2-5 hours isn't a short amount of time to spend farming gold for a couple of respecs.
---
I worry about it cuz i know i wanna both pvp and pve. 
---
But i also look forward trying to earn some coins for the respecs.
---
I remember farming gold was just a normal part of playing back then, dont mind it this time around either.
---
I'll do a second pass tonight, I scoured various sources so I imagine some info might have changed or been incorrect.
---
They were bad but not as bad as some flightpoints
---
Adding content to vanilla that was scrapped would be so cool. Grim batol, karazhan, Azshara crater etc
---
&gt;I love BFA, I do.
---
Who are they trying to convince? Us or themself?
---
Maybe some people dont feel like waiting for those guilds to flop around scrambling after they hit 60 to recruit 30 other people? Maybe they like the comfort of knowing hey this is a group who has there shit together with enough foresight to recruit and stay active months ahead?
---
Most of the guilds who wait will end up dying on the vine or merging.
---
I know a lot of people who play FFXIV, and if they released classic the same day as shadowbringer they'll all just play shadowbringer.
---
If they release it a week in advance, people will simply wait, because they don't want to get sucked into another game.
---
But if they release two weeks in advance, a lot of people will try it because they have nothing to do while they wait for the next expansion. Bliz hopes that in that two weeks they'll get hooked and not leave.
---
For iceblock you should see the same effect as a paladin would for bubble, but with the added twist of you cant move yourself.
---
Bagnon is the only one I want! Need, even.
---
i actaully like DHK, it stops high level "griefers" from totally stomping on questhubs, city's and NPC.   
---
If it was not in the game, the pvp would be so toxic, nothing would stop people from just kill what they want and when they want.
---
This is why they should add sharting at the starting areas during the beginning... I don’t care what anyone says
---
Yeah I didn't say it was a good thing, but it's without a doubt very common here
---
Hi Chrisand11, we have no problems with multiboxers.  You're paying for the game, so you play the way you want!
---
We have one other that is planning on multiboxing at the start as well, albeit he's only doing two at a time.  Not sure how many you're planning on rocking.
---
He and I have also both agreed that he'd only be allowed to bring in one account to a raid, allowing 39 other members a chance at raiding as well.  I would hold you to the same standards.
---
Let me know if I can answer any other questions.
---
If he’s union it was bargained for in their contract. There are a lot of reason to require a one year period before using vacation.
---
WTF is this kneejerk autism? Are you actually serious right now?  Why are you even jumping down my throat?  I never endorsed any sort of dictatorship.  I said that having 40 people make a decision and then 5-8 more people make a second decision...for every piece of loot will take longer than other methods.  I even said I LOVED the idea, just that it would take a long ass time to deal with loot.
---
Yeah definitely. Casual is one of those vague terms for things like this, unfortunately.
---
i spent 12 hours clearing BRD one day. I think I, a mage, was the only original member at the end. I'd never be able to devote 12 hours to that today, but i kind of liked it.
---
Am I in the regular WoW forums? This is the kind of posts you see as retail is in a death spiral and everyone is leaving it. Then their reddit wonders why the game isn’t fun when all they’ve asked the devs to address was how their horses headdress sits on their model
---
Everyone has to decide what its worth to them.  If you cant be bothered then thats on you.  Its still a neccesary gold sink in classic.
---
Is it possible for druids to farm her at 60 like hunters can?
---
&gt; If the raid is fun, then raid. 
---
For most WoW players (I assume) the fun from raids comes from beating the bosses. When you have done that once it's just another grind to prepare you for whatever the next challenge is. I guess if you get a bit into speedrunning and stuff like that it could become more interesting to farm raids, but then you got to be into that sort of thing as well. 
---
Especially Naxx is kind of hard to justify the farm of, if we know there is nothing coming after.
---
I assume it will take a long time the first few, then after the players/classes get a system, it will speed up substantially.
---
Are 2h primary weapons viable in raids? Seems like ret blows, enhance blows, druids and hunters don't count, and warriors would rather dual wield. I want to be a warrior to use Ashkandi/Corrupted Ashbringer but it seems like I would actually end up dual wielding.
---
Leveling. Some like it, i personally don't enjoy it that much.
---
Actually the way I can see making it work, would be to pre-decide on all the items via a spreadsheet.  
---
Say you're progressing MC. List all the items in a spreadsheet, and pre-determine which class gets the first X number of them.  Then when they drop the classes can workout who specifically gets it based on who is there, what they need, etc etc.
---
Like so many more I found him during his Cataclysm beta videos, but I didn't really follow him until he started casting Starcraft 2 as I was pretty done with WoW at that point.
---
Shaman had a tank spec in vanilla. They were only "intended" to tank 5m dungeons, but I'm sure they could tank MC/Ony if they really wanted to.
---
Probably for being another repost.  Finally this place might see a little order.
---
Big kek
---
Hey,
---
As the title suggests and classic is approaching I'm looking for help in finding any players who are in the process of looking for a guild on ally.
---
I have a pretty long history with WoW, started playing in 2004 at the age of 15 and soon became hooked. I found a raiding guild who had just started MC and ended up staying in that guild as a DPS warrior for about 3 - 4 years clearing up to princess huhuran in AQ40. Ended up doing a few raids in BC before the guild disbanded Lol.
---
So I'm super hyped vanilla is coming back and really looking to get raiding again to relive those good times.
---
If there is any discord chat links or anybody discussing anything regarding a guild get in touch.
---
Looking to play holy priest this time round as I have some experience healing and playing shadow in cataclysm.
---
Anyone looking for an experienced player and some decent chat to go with it get in touch ;)
---
Idk if copyright allows playing the main menu theme on the site, but that would be really cool together with the new background :)
---
Most classes can farm 100g in a couple of hours or less.
---
I'm still hoping that they launch separate TBC servers but allow us to copy our classic characters over.
---
&gt;maybe 2 hours per night
---
and back then, "simply switching zones" was not simple, and took a lot of time, especially if you didn't have quests elsewhere started.
---
My Shaman (Can't use Atiesh) still has a Splinter in his bank. Once we knew we wouldn't clear Naxx in Vanilla a few of us got Splinters for a laugh. I did end up finishing that questline with some guildies in TBC though. Super cool fight in Stratholme.
---
NO. And, by the way, you don't... deserve that. You think you do, but you don't. Recount - DPS for Last Fight:
---
&gt; would be to pre-decide on all the items via a spreadsheet.
---
Honestly, yes. That was also my idea, but each class would have a way of doing it.   
---
A good leader allows subordinates to come to those conclusions naturally, instead of forcing them to accomplish things.   
---
Im just open to loot systems that increase player autonomy, rather than just making them a DPS.Heal bot.
---
Probably the classism of the min/max crowd for what will even be pub'd raids.
---
I get ya prob dont want like 8 enh shamans, but i just know some tool is gonna pretend it's the difference between killing Garr or not.
---
He is, and I can’t stand looking at the state of his room either. But I think he’s got a lot of shit going on in his life, taking care of his mother and such. So I try and give him the benefit of the doubt
---
Bartender.
---
It really doesn't though. The people who really care about DHK affecting their honor are farming BG's all day for higher rank, not attacking quest hubs. The people who are attacking quest hubs are going to keep attacking quest hubs and still get high enough rank to get some of the lower tier rewards.
---
&gt; nothing would stop people from just kill what they want and when they want. 
---
There is nothing to stop this. DHKs discourages it a bit, but it's not going to stop.
---
No. Just NO. Horde lore is as dumb as horde NPCs, horde towns are designed by someone as dumb as orcs.
---
The Bugged Boss. You probably downed him after managing to do the evade glitch properly after the 465th time.
---
I will say, when Blizz transitioned from vanilla diablo 3 to ROS it was seemless and awesome. My friends and I were on voice chat farming last minute and suddenly one of us yells "I'm getting experience again!!" and we were off to the new zone and played until the sun came up.
---
Also: I wasnt attacking you. My apologies. I was responding to what I perceived as pessimism.
---
Just a troll post about predicting the release date.
---
Good thought! I'm going Human Paladin and she's going Human Mage
---
You 7.0 LUA?
---
Fair enough, I can see the logic there.
---
Like I mentioned, I'd just be surprised if it launched before July.
---
I'm in the camp of thinking July (possibly that 16th easter egg), or August. But at the same time, I can't believe September, that seems way too late.
---
what about 5moonkin instead of 5man?
---
No restrictions related to abilities, all requirements are to be able to shapeshift into moonkin for group screenshot.
---
Yes but most people want hybrids pigeon holed into healing.  You'll notice most of the people who think the respec fee is fine play pure classes anyways that don't need to respec.
---
I suspect it's going to bite them in the ass long term when more people just avoid hybrids altogether.
---
You think you do, but...
---
https://m.imgur.com/t/reaction_gif/XS5LK
---
Agreed, the main issue with the system is it doesn't really effect the people it's meant to. The guy running around killing quest givers for fun likely isn't someone trying to hit tank 12-14. 
---
The system basically discourages world pvp/city raids. I won't be joining a group doing that after phase two drops until I've hit my rank goal.
---
I cannot wait.
---
You might like how a lot of pserver pugs run their loot.  They use what's called a "soft-res" or "soft reserve" system.  What happens is every person coming to the raid lists one item they would like to "soft reserve".  Generally it can be any item with common sense restrictions like.... "you can res tier that isn't for your class", and more than one person can "soft reserve" the same item.  If that item drops, only the people that soft reserved it can roll on it, and they just do a /roll generally.  If only one person soft reserves an item, then they automatically get it.  If an item drops that noone soft reserves then it gets /rolled MS&gt;OS, and if noone wants at all generally it gets sharded or greed rolled.
---
Itemrack and/or outfitter are practically a must-have for raiding, allowing you to quickly swap between: resistance sets, dps set, tank (or healing) set, PvP set, trinkets, shield, etc.
---
Doing all that manually is usually possible, but in practice it takes too much focus and time to be efficient.
---
Cry more, go to a carebear (PvE) realm.
---
Should watch the Lore video on her, apparently deer guys like fat chicks.
---
true i still like the system thou, even if its a minor inconvenience it serves a purpose. But if something it should be buffed, not nerfed.
---
Loot council if you are a serious guild.
---
DKP with weekly decay(and rules about what items you can and cannot get as each class) if you are not. There's nothing wrong with using DKP with weekly decay. It's a good system but if you want to optimize raid performance and loot distribution, LC is the way to go. It has its risks with corruption and poor loot giving performance, but if done correctly it's the best system, and in a "serous" guild it will probably be done correctly.
---
The beautiful(guy) and the beast 😂
---
I hope I get a chance to try fire as a mage, sometime. It always looked fun, but Frost was always just so much easier to level as, and for MC.
---
I was in a top 10 world guild in Vanilla and I think we only finished 2 staves in our guild. A mage one for the +2% crit aura and a warlock one for the 33 spellpower aura.
---
AT least if you aren't a mage, then it's a portal relatively close to Stonard for the Horde. Not super useful for Alliance though...
---
Land of the free home of the 30 million no health coverage citizens. I'm so glad to have insurance through my work, but to think I'm not one distaster away from being homeless and uninsured is low IQ.
---
All hail the Hochlord!
---
If you ask me what made Vanilla what it is.
---
It is this, the ability to do almost anything from Force Flagging people with Eyes of the beast to Kiting world bosses to major cities and laying waste to them.
---
Just confused me, I was like "I agree with you, I just see a hangup with it".  The main reason that jumped out at me is because that system *would* take longer unless it was all pre-mapped out, and I've always seen alot of bitching about how long loot takes.
---
You have good points but you dont know how to say them at all
---
That kinda stinks. There were definitely some cliques but that was because there were a few groups of irl friends. But we all got along fine and did dungeons and pvp together. We even played other games together if there was a lull in content. I specifically remember tf2 and battlefield. Even had some irl meetups, but i was away at basic training for that.
---
That's wild! All in we probably saw 5-7 drop during vanilla. I switched over to a hunter after a while so stopped paying attention to the last couple. Meanwhile we only got 1 full set of bindings for thunderfury, and it was waaaaay after clearing BWL. We were in disbelief how much easier phase 1 Nef was with TF, was basically ezmode.
---
Human gets approximately 2% more threat/dps.
---
Night Elf gets 1% dodge.
---
Dwarf gets a defensive cooldown to clear poison/bleed/disease and increase armor by 10%.
---
Gnome gets... to clear snares Sometimes? Level weapon skills faster?
---
Honestly tho it doesn't matter unless your guild is going for world firsts. The most important thing is that you want to tank and will do it right.
---
Dwarf is a fine choice.
---
Why would i do that, i enjoy pvp. And i can pvp and get high ranks without killing NPC's. if you like to kill npc or farm lowbies that cant defend themself thats on you. no reason to be rude.
---
Yup, I loved that system when I use it on a pserver once. Then the guild merged and they used LC.   
---
Vanilla is about working with others, LC doesnt do that. These other system increase player communication and deal making about loot. Thats great!
---
People mentioning stuff they did in Vanilla in a humblebrag sort of "yeah I was there m8" kind of way
---
If you want a whore, buy one
---
If you want a Princess, roll hunter and solo farm her
---
Agree 100%.  In upstate NY, there’s a LOT of places like Westfall.
---
Prove what?
---
centaurs?? 😭😂
---
Emerald fucking dream. It was in the dev playground on live servers in vanilla. I used speedhacks to tele there and GM island at one point
---
What faction will you play
---
No.  Tmogs.
---
&gt;wildly disappointed
---
That is too weak of a word for it. I cant describe how disappointed I will be.
---
Guys, timewalking this week is Cataclysm dungeons (and I know you vanilla guys love cata...). And they are really really easy. 
---
And I don't know what that guy is up to in BfA but we probably have the most difficult dungeon experience of any expansion with M+ right now. It also requires communication for doing any decent keys. 
---
Only reason he's having difficulty in timewalking cata is because he literally doesn't know how the mechanics work. It's really simple if you know what stuff does. Like, stand in this protection area now and you won't die kind of simple.
---
I like the ranking system. It rewards skill but puts time investment at the highest, which is how MMORPG games should work. 
---
As for DHK they are a big miss. There's 2 big flaws:
---
A) People who sit and grief players NPC's are almost never actual rankers, so DHK's are often seen as a highscore for them rather than a punishment.
---
B) The mobs that count as dishonorable are random NPC's with mostly no actual meaning. They aren't useful to kill, so the only time you actually get DHK's is if you are either intentionally killing them, or doing some sort of big raid-like thing where it dies in the chaos or AoE.
---
I just tried to get my account unbanned because of this.
---
Even after 11 years they won't budge. :(
---
If they knew, they would tell us.
---
Yeah no guild had naxx on farm. It was the absolute guild breaker.    
---
On that note I knew a guy with atiesh, he even let me play on his account. The top two guilds on my server had to combine they’re top 20 to kill The Lich.
---
&gt; would take longer unless it was all pre-mapped out
---
Ok, but I dont see that as an issue, but a feature. Consider a guild where everyone votes for the class, and the Druids ALWAYS take forever, but the rogues are /roll and LETS GO!   
---
A subtle trend will emerge as the loot will be voted to go to rogues, and the druids MUST adapt and improve or else forfeit loot to the backstabbers.
---
Corrupt Ashbringer was a 2 handed sword that was on the regular old drop table for the 4 Horseman in Naxx40.
---
Ateish had a very long, very difficult, and tedious chain quest to obtain
---
Why were you banned?
---
My main will be a Mage and i'll level with Mining (to powerlevel Engineering later) and Skinning. Then i'll switch Skinning with Tailoring and Mining with Engineering. Craft mt BoP chest and get rid of Tailoring for Herbalism. WIth Herbalism i'll powerlevel Alchemy on my alt.
---
I had a *really* bad experience with LC in WoD and flat refuse to use it.   Going into legion my guild even briefly considered it...I flat out told them I would not be raiding with them at all if we used LC...and I was an officer and would have *been on* the LC.   DKP, with even minor amounts of collusion, is too game-able to make it anymore fair than /roll with MS&gt;OS IMO, and causes just as much drama as LC in my experience with it.
---
Soft-Res has honestly been my favorite system I've experienced, and in the recent pserv groups I've run using it, I've seen it foster nothing but laughter, cheers, and good times.  Never once a bit of drama or hurt feelings.
---
&gt;if you like to kill npc or farm lowbies that cant defend themself thats on you. no reason to be rude.
---
Did.... did you play Vanilla? You aren't going to last long if that's all it takes to get to you. That's pretty much a word for word response you'd expect to see in general chat/forums.
---
You need 40 splinters. A full Naxx clear drops about 4 splinters on average. If you get every one that drops, and you clear Naxx every week, that's 10 weeks on average, plus an extra week because you also need to kill KT again during the process of assembling the staff.
---
World first Atiesh was obtained ~3 months after Naxx opened. That's the fastest anybody did it, but not many people actually raided Naxx (and I don't think anybody did full clears from week 1) so it's likely to be faster this time around.
---
Mate I can’t stop stressing about this haha at first it was between hunter and mage (easy gold and I like raiding as a ranged class which I’ve done before, also quality of life) Then rogue (so much fun to be had, and great dps) but now I’m thinking warrior (minimal wait times for dungeon groups as tank and also great dps option) the only thing about warrior is the difficulty to make gold
---
I’’ll also not have as much time to play as I would like due to life so that’s also a factor
---
arghhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
---
Timewalking is still piss easy. It's just Cataclysm this week and he doesn't know about some simple mechanics that one shots you. 
---
If you want difficult dungeons in BfA you play M+, which is on higher keys much harder than any vanilla content, and maybe any other previous expansion.
---
*Laughs in Alchemist Resto Shaman*
---
Why not? it's fun to troll a bunch of beta virgins.
---
I dunno, bubblehearth has plenty of trolling/rage potential.
---
i did, i took rank 12 back in the day, and ive played on pservers. Never ever had over 10 DHK
---
Warlock. You can enchant a skinning knife with 30 spellpower and send it to each warlock you plan to level before selling it after you are done.
---
1-10 is also considerably easier.
---
What does it make you? Clown. xD
---
Reminds me of Pokémon, all the crazy stories how to get Celebi in Gold and Silver... while in fact you could only get it from special real world events.
---
Amount of soulshards. Not soulshards in general(love them), but the quantity that is sometimes needed.
---
And being stuck somewhere in nowhere with hearthstone cd being so long.
---
&gt; Never once a bit of drama or hurt feelings.
---
Thats the goal. Thanks for the ideas!
---
Name any reason for that then
---
Well no, the deer guy, uh "becoming good friends with" the princess caused the Centaurs to exist. So the deer guys are a different "race" than the centaurs.
---
2h warrior slam spec is viable AFAIK but falls down when you get more AP  (which bloodthirst scales on).
---
Botting, 'apparently'.
---
Go human paladin Male. Mace spec and sword spec and rep gain. Don't need stoneform as a paladin because cleanse and bop and bubble for bleeds. Rogues don't stand a chance anyways.
---
how do you kill that which has no life?
---
I don't want her, you can have her, she's too fat for me...
---
I love doing that kinda shit. I do it in tanaris too
---
I'm trying to look up a guide on how to get this on priest and am having trouble finding one. Anyone have a link?
---
Looking at how vague and prevalent it is from recruitment posts, I'm calling it now: *Semi-hardcore* will be to Classic what "RP welcome but not mandatory" was to vanilla.
---
Well it is a year old, but I haven’t read it. So thanks, OP.
---
Kind of missing OP’s point. He won’t be able to kill the guys looting that black lotus anyways. He’ll be level 60 in crap gear in 4-6 months contending with raiders and pvp’ers who have passed him months ago.
---
Did they prevent it for Kazzak specifically? Because I remember bringing Anachronos to Gadgetzan in WotLK, so kiting bosses long distances was definitely possible.
---
RE ranking system:  I've been playing MMOs since before WoW existed, and I do actually agree that time investment should matter (though I'd say it should be an equal split so that a person deficient in one area can pickup the slack in the other area)  However, in my personal experience in actual vanilla, it rewards whomever is able to most effectively and sneakily break the TOS by sharing accounts and colluding with the opposite faction to dodge each other.  
---
Regarding DHKs:  Your first point was exactly what I was saying.  It does nothing to deter the people that it was meant to deter.  Your second point is the one I see most people acknowleding...the fact that it prevents rankers from wanting to take part in wpvp especially city raids.
---
shoulder*
---
Let me check my crystal ball.
---
This.
---
I've been keeping my own smaller list just like this from the LFG Monday posts, but I need the raid times to determine which guild to pick.
---
Duh that’s vanilla like.
---
Ive always hated DKP with flat prices. I understand there are many variations of it, and I dont know most of them. But what I hate about it, is that most guilds in Classic will have people who have been there from day 1, just stacking up tons of DKP, and those people will mostly just be able to get whatever they want over newer guys.
---
Only DKP system that makes sense to me is auction dkp, where you simply bid your dkp on the item that drops. But even this has a huge downside of people refusing to buy upgrades because they want some specific item, and they are basically just getting carried all the way through, getting their upgrades when everyone else has theirs.
---
Disagree. Hunter is faster 1-60 than warlock because you will kill faster and have less downvote which is king later in the game, 40-60.
---
If the goal is 1-35 only then Warlock probably wins out due to better early level talents and easier 1-10.
---
I don’t think there will be that much grief. I mean, Vanilla came out when a lot of people were 8-12 years old and they got along just fine. If I could do it as a clueless adolescent I’m sure modern gamers will get the hang of it.
---
Yea, but then you'll also be power leveling tailoring a second time on the same alt. Also, once ZG comes out, you'll need Tailoring again on your main for bloodvine.
---
If I were you, I'd start off mining/skinning (as all DPS and tanks should). I'd then swap skinning for Tailoring at some point between level 40-60. Max tailoring, get your chest and bags, but then hold ono it for ZG. I'd then drop mining for Engineering and be done with it. As a mage, you'll just need to grind gold to support your consumalbes and engineering needs (it's not like you no longer need to mine once you max Engineering -- you'll need ore for your charges, bombs, etc.).
---
Alternatively, you could level an alt (ideally a warlock or paladin) that could handle gathering herbs for you to help cutdown costs, though as a mage you'll likely make more gold perhour grinding than the herbs you farm will be worth anyway.
---
Yes they are. We dont care, they play a facebook mom game.
---
I'm not sure it was fixed before 1.12, but even assuming it was...remember at Blizzcon Ion mentioned how they might revert certain 'bug fixes' that they think would create a more authentic Vanilla experience. I hope this would be one of those reversions. Seeing Kazzak in Stormwind would be utterly epic.
---
There is always BfA for ya.
---
We dont know how long phases will be.
---
And this time around people wont play with 10fps
---
Why do you think it's so strange to ask that question? I'm trying to fetch some insight as a guy who never raided Naxx back in the day, but if people could get it in 2006, I'm sure you could today as well.
---
Honestly, the fact that a huge amount of specs are strait garbage for raiding. Totally kills my fun knowing that if I want to progress  with top guilds I cant run many of my favorite specs.
---
That's why I loved TBC it didnt completley fiz this, but it made a shitloads of improvements to the general viability of meme specs. 
---
Before you tell me "all specs were viable not optimal" yes if your raid doesnt care to progress as fast or not as far. But the developers original intent was for every spec to be able to raid at an optimal/close to look optimal potential. Not 50-70% of a pure class dps or tank capacity.
---
The client we will use won’t be the 1.12 API, was m sure some one will make EPGP addon.
---
Ehh just call in sick.
---
No, Joanna's guide only works well when you have little or no competition for mobs. The guide even mentions grinding out half a level at a time at specific camps that don't have enough mobs for more than 2 people.
---
Should have kept a look out and picked the black lotus before him then.
---
No changes
---
I wouldn't say love, but I like BfA. Want me to try and convince you?
---
Mage? No. Unless you can aoe grind and the aoe spots are unoccupied then mage simply have too much downtime. For solo questing the old fashion way with one mob at a time, you have Hunter &gt; Warlock &gt; Priest
---
I'll ask my dad, he works at blizzard.
---
i know there was addons back in tbc for it, but we used a website in vanilla + we wrote dkp points in "note" in guild. Have you checked out, [https://www.webdkp.com/](https://www.webdkp.com/)  ?
---
Bullshit employers need to give their employees 2 weeks vacation every year.
---
By the way the spec you mentioned is fucking godlike. Get illumination and reckoning and the rest is up to you. You can pve heal just fine without crit. Just eat mana potion if an issue
---
I plan to get myself in as healthy a physical condition as I am able prior to launch. Then, when launch hits, I plan to take time off work and fully immerse myself in the game. It would be difficult to play for so many hours without building up healthiness beforehand.
---
I thought July 16th was announced already.
---
Yup, early Cata dungeons were the most fun I'd had in dungeons since TBC. When they were nerfed down to WotLK levels it was one of the huge reasons I unsubbed. 
---
The other was the reveal that Rag was going to be the next tier raid boss. I wasn't about to raid Rag a 2nd time when the previous tier was killing Nef for the second time and Ony for the third time. Content recycling leads to burn out.
---
The best thing to do as a hunter is to need on stat stick items without on-hit effects, and preferably when other people don't need them. However, even if other classes do, sometimes you've been stuck with the same underleveled piece of garbage and you really need to replace it... it's unavoidable.
---
Rogues taking hunter bows are totally different though. While leveling they don't have any flat stat boosts, doing nothing for rogues, when it's a huge damage increase for hunters. Rogues can literally do just fine with level 5 throwing knives, since they use them almost exclusively for pulling.
---
So you deserved it then.
---
Healers
---
Right, some of us are saying we wish wasn’t though.
---
At the same time, I think we've all been that player that got all the way to the dungeon without realizing their gear is at like 5/50 durability.
---
Dont waste your time bud. This sub is filled with the exact people you're talking about. Just gotta accept there's a lot of people who cant pvp their own lvl so they get over that by killing people who have no chance of winning.
---
The date of this is interesting. It's August 9th, 2006 and clearly at this point you could still kite Kazzak to Stormwind. Patch 1.12 was just shy of two weeks later. So it might very well not have been made impossible to kite him until after that. Which means it's a definite possibility in Classic.
---
We don't know yet. That's probably the next "big" bluepost we're going to get
---
&gt; "Yeah, this is one of the most controversial parts I think in my tenure at Blizzard," says Street. "For someone who had kind of grown up on really difficult Burning Crusade dungeons, I'd kind of hated what they become at the end of Lich King. We knew that having new dungeons in Cataclysm where players were appropriately-geared would make them much more challenging. I also gave the team the direction: let's go back to 'finishing a dungeon is an accomplishment.' 
---
The issues of easy dungeons in Wrath is what led to this problem in Cataclysm. Unfortunately, the Wrath babies were upon us. 
---
I hope these kind of lessons are documented for if/when they do create "new" content for Classic. Keep content difficult so you keep the goal for players to achieve as well as a sense of accomplishment.
---
Nets were added in later versions
---
I always thought 100 was only kind of tough to get - you can scrounge a bit and have it by 43 without too much trouble. 
---
Now the epic mounts - if you don’t have a good gold strategy the grind is going to suuuuck.
---
Release date for a release date. POG
---
Free to buy your own healthcare or get a job that has it.  I mean why is it so absurd to pay for a service? Are the prices high? Yes I can agree with that but to assume you should just get it on the backs of everyone else's paycheck is absurd. 
---
Under 18, no problem. Over 65, sure. Between those ages, no, go earn your own healthcare like I have to do.
---
Meeeeethril
---
In the USA the average is 10 days vacation for employees so I’m not quite sure where you’re getting that :P
---
yeah it seems like it, thank you for beeing a decent person :)
---
Eww
---
Hottie!
---
Patchface was my flair.
---
If only one of you could give a reason why.  Do you understand why gold sinks are necessary?
---
I don't think there is a resource for that in vanilla. I think blizzard had to release an API for add-ons to use at some later expansion for long term price tracking to be possible
---
Sadly this is your best dps in dungeons leveling up.  No one takes Shadowbolt talents while leveling, so it is a super long cast time with mediocre damage.  Not a huge burst potential on single targets, but if we are tanking 3 elites or more, the dots on the non-skulls really help out.
---
I am the same, but the other way around.  What I would do to play a Tauren shammy :(
---
I don't like dishonorable kills, I still remember going from blood guard to stone guard, just because some guy killed a civilian when I was in a huge raid on the way to stormwind.
---
Around 40 and once your get some SP gear SB starts pulling its weight a little more.
---
Classic for PVE, TBC 2.0 for PVP.  Bring it.
---
Dunno abou timewalking. I just que up with my tank and afk while keeping agroo watching tv or something. I literally imposible for my pally to die.
---
Time. Things are going to take a very, very long time. Obviously that's part of what makes Classic so meaningful, but...you'll see
---
Alright, I’ll bite...how’s this work besides farming mats for your own mana pots??
---
Higher res pls.
---
Consecration. It doesn't feel high impact, but boy do I enjoy casting that ability...always have, always will.
---
I dont want to try it on mobile but check the undermine journal.  They might not have data back that far, but worth a look.
---
Right there with you. Lvl 40 is a sweet spot, you get a mount and nice spells. It's time to go back to that neglected alt sitting at lvl 24.
---
Can a mage with level 55 water hook me up?
---
*cries priest tears*
---
Don't forget about the cool wooden shoes
---
Tailoring isn't a gold consuming profession to skill up imo so i think it's a shame to waste a prof spot from MC to ZG, i'd rather have Eng and Herbalism and re train Tailoring when it matters again. For Engineering u really don't need mining for it at 300. Once u crafted the juicy BoP item u just need the minerals for the granades and they're cheap on the AH (I'll go Gnome and hopefully have a guildie goign Goblin to craft the Sappers for me).
---
You either compromise on your build, or find enough gold to fund your respec
---
Will it also give me certainty?
---
I, too, would enjoy sharting in the starting areas.
---
I have amazing healthcare through my work. 10$ copays at docs/ 20 for specialist, nearly all my meds are covered surgery's etc. But you do realize that if something catastrophic happens and your unable to work and your between those ages you started you essentially fucked right ? 
---
You do realize without you or your own employer having to pay these ridiculous monthly payments youd actually be saving or making more money right ? You dont think everyone having access to healthcare like every other first world country wouldnt improve everyone's overall quality of life ? This society's "I got mine and fuck you" standard is exactly the problem with what is wrong in the world. And once again you are free to buy your own healthcare even in the case of a completley socialized system. It just seems like such a no brainer for me when I talk to people from other countrys. They literally laugh at us lol
---
Yeah wtf man. It’s like the 40 mount and talent is the reward for me. Then I think of those last 20 levels and I’m like pfft nah.
---
Shadowfang for sure. I've had 5 total drop throughout pservers and retail, but i must've run SFK 1500 times by now.
---
That God damn fire bird. So in TBC there was a mount that as a flaming pheonix. It's been so long, but I think it was called "Ages of Alar " or something like that. I raided that place every week. When WotLK dropped, I still would farm it with friends every week. Nothing. Then Cata dropped. Still farmed it for 6 more months. Nothing. Gave up. Ended up leaving wow until WOD, and got a friend to play with me. We were in storm wind and he saw someone with the mount and asked where to get it. Told him. He went in. Got it on the first run. I rage quit for like 3 months. Still don't have that bird....
---
Can't wait to log in tonight to claim my mission table rewards!!!!
---
Call in sick with the flu. My god that nasty flu. Can’t have that going around the office. Could take a full week to get over it too
---
Nope
---
Oh ofc, if you are a rogue or warrior crusader and agi,main hand / off hand. I meant as druids and every spec of it , I always go for + stats or +healing etc. But melee class is totally different thing that I don't have much experience other than a ZG geared rogue.

Drinking. So, so much drinking
---
&gt; WoW Retail has been hemorrhaging players as of late also.
---
The price now is the same as it was in early December....over 4 months ago.  
---
Also source on the hemorrhaging?
---
The stock was higher over summer, which isnt at all surprising with as well as Legion did and BfA on the horizon.  It dropped a bit after, but wasnt doing terribly.  On November 1st it was the same price it was in mid April (one year ago).
---
In the month after that it fell *hard*, which probably had a lot to do with the weak blizzcon.  
---
In that way i do agree that Blizzard probably wants to release something, but the stock price isnt exactly *terrible* at this point.  You made it look a lot worse than the situation is (long term) by choosing the timeframe that made your argument look best.
---
The simple fact is that the stock price right now is higher than it had been at ANY point before March of 2017.  
---
No doubt they want it to go up, but it also sounds like they have plenty of projects in the works for 2020, so things will almost certainly rebound either way.
---
Lots of mp5, mana totems, having a warrior alt with herbalism and skinning so I can pick my own herbs and sell leather when not raiding.
---
Extreme.
---
Thunderfury was first raid, accessible for 2+ years, typically went to tanks first, so maybe 2-4 people in the running.
---
Rag was first raid, accessible for 2+ years, typically went to warriors or paladins/shaman who pvped as dps. So maybe 12 people 
---
Atiesh was fourth raid, open for mere months. Required a fully t2/2.5 geared raid to attempt. Could have gone to any mage/lock/priest/Druid so figure 15+.
---
Everyone (pretty much) had seen a tf or hand of rag on their server at least once. Only 23 guilds in the us killed KT, most servers and thus players never saw it in game.
---
Says the guy who thinks cross faction communication is bad for a war game.
---
How does elemental damage enhancers work? Like Enchant Gloves - Fire Power. Does it add 20 damage to any flame damage done. Like Fiery Weapon/Flametongue proc or Immolate ticks?
---
I’ll take a look
---
I really hope that the author of Luna makes it work on classic, I have fallen in love with that add on. If not, I hope that Grid will work on classic.
---
Because I’m now 28 years old with 2 kids. I’m not commenting on what is balanced and what isn’t. I’m only saying that as an adult with responsibilities, I wish I didn’t have to spend quite so long on the farming aspect of the game as my play time is quite limited.
---
Retail fanboys like yourself would do anything to get more people to play it.
---

---
Stopping portals isn't stopping the legions entirety. The bonus we had was they didn't know the exact location of Azeroth. If it wasn't for their alternate universe guldan they never would have.
---
You know you can kill enemy NPCs on PVE realms too?
---
I will be needing on melee weapon as a hunter because I will be mostly tanking but I highly doubt the weps I'll require are wanted by many.
---
Can they? Absolutely.
---
Do they want to? Not at all.
---
Modern gamers like to be spoon fed.
---
Got a link?
---
Ah yes, nothing like a spirit healer in a completely different zone on the wrong side of a stretch of mountains. Best not to wipe in BFD.
---
Oh maybe , tbh I played a lot but joined after MC release so not sure what happened before that. When I got to be level 60 and get some decent dungeon gear progress was finished. I don't know if it's possible to hit exalted without donations. I remember hitting revered with SW easily bc a lot of dungeon quests etc.
---
He said disaster. Shit happens to people they can not control. I live in Sweden and intend to work until 70, but I still feel very reassured and calm in that if shit goes down, my countrymen/women got my back. No way that I would trade that feeling for a bit more cash in my account.
---
Well the most obvious glaring problem is you cannot heal in Moonkin form which makes it worthless as a PvP spec since going in and out of form while triggering global cooldowns just isnt worth it.
---
The least of my worries is the game itself, it's the people. Alot of elitists, toxicity and incel garbage.
---
The phase system. Some content should be available sooner like at least one BG. I get why honor is being delayed but there should be a bit more pvp content.
---
Hey, it also takes you to a part of the world with no portal destinations close by for horde. It's handy if you're trying to fight other guilds over Kazzak or Emeriss.
---
Hunter is always ahead on every single server release, sometimes druid 1-20, but never warlock. They can catch up quite well later, but hunter 1-10 might be 1 hour slower but the 10-35 is super fast on hunter.
---
The fact that the columns for WoW and IRL pics switches made my head explode. RIP me.
---
Only dogs like bones
---
As someone who has almost always played Ret, started in Vanilla but only hit level 40ish and never really started raiding untill wrath, I'm seriously sad about how 'useless' the class will be.
---
Oh lawd she cumin
---
You're in for a wake up call if you're planning on raiding as a warlock. You clearly have no idea how the trinket is used or how many shards you go through in a single night of raiding, let alone a long night of wipes during progression. The fact that you insist that you can easily refill shards while raiding makes me question if you've ever done any vanilla raid content at all.
---
Your only argument is that the trinket is taking up a slot that could be used to hold one shard. During a 2-3 hour raid you can use the trinket 4-6 times. Since you seem particularly dense let me point out that 4 is greater than 1.
---
neither play a support paladin.
---
Just tell them to get quest tracking addons. Addons remove a lot of the needless anti quality of life problems in vanilla.
---
&gt;sneakily break the TOS by sharing accounts and colluding with the opposite faction to dodge each other.
---
It's hardly the system fault that people cheat. These players should be banned, the system should not be changed.
---
Frost Mage is essential for every bg Group and offers a lot of utility and good dmg. Sheep is the best cc in 90% of all dungeons, you will find groups easily. For raiding mages are very good too and Needed.
---
Not much, in general most of the mechanics are simpler than retail.
---
The time sinks are a lot bigger though.
---
That'd be him 😂
---
I will miss my favourite race the draenei :(
---
In order to keep up with the leading edge you will likely need to follow a guide like the bible. 
---
Really I just want quest helper because that is what I used in Vanilla and that is the vanilla experience for me.
---
It's fine for 95% of the game. Only part of the game where ret stops being "viable" is in high end guild that raid seriously.
---

'Best' can be defined in a lot of ways, but by my standard that would be:
---
    - Consistent performance both in dps but also in mechanic execution
---
    - Consistent attendance over 80%
---
This is assuming all factors are equal. By the time you hit AQ 40 / Naxx the upgrades become more evenly spread, except for tanks, which obviously take precedence.
---
What could possibly go wrong
---
well it made it so city raids had to either be very careful when infiltrating a city, or for the raid group to exclude players currently ranking.
---
Simply removing DHK's would make city raids have no drawbacks, and would be masked behind "Quality of life updates" which is a slippery slope towards "fixing" many other preconceived "annoyances".
---
As someone who has played Prot palading extensively I find it absolutely laughable how Im getting downvoted by people who cant even be arsed to leave a comment saying what they disagree with.
---
This community is so trash.
---
Just have try! Crap a friend and start together this project WoW classic! you will enjoy it..and learn it easy:)
---
I wouldn't say I'm majorly concerned considering the account is a retail account. 
---
Still, could've been a fun nostalgia trip.
---
Twitch/Streaming culture distorting Classic.
---
Just don't die 4Head
---
Enchanting for two reasons.
---
1. The Runed Rods are specific to the enchants. So you have a collection of rods where each rod is used for a specific range of enchants, instead of the later releases where a greater rod can be used in place of any lessor rods.
---
2. No inscription available. This means that your enchanter can cast enchants on any player of the same faction... Except your own alts. Also, it means that if you intend on selling your enchants, you're gonna have to be online and spam trade chat instead of actually quest and have fun.
---
Doesn't take very long to fly to menethil from IF, I don't mind it.
---
User deleted their account, unsurprisingly. I'd already banned them though, because they posted this as a re-post despite us removing it once, and we have pretty low tolerance for having to double up our workload purely because people ignore our requests to stop re-posting crap. We always allow speculation/theories, we almost never allow "THIS WILL HAPPEN" without any shred of self-doubt included.
---
Thanks for the reminder, I had a good laugh about this.
---
Did this on a healer, on a private server just two days ago. It was the most fun I have had in wow since the launch of TBC.
---
Can hunter pets gain buffs? Like fortitude, or blessing of might? And what about world buffs, like rallying cry of the dragonslayer?
---
No I plan to run a second ah account and slow level alts to 35...
---
I will tell you the real story that will explain it to you. I had made 2-3 70lvl horde characters long time ago. After leveling up those, leveling an alliance character was a nightmare for me. I felt like there are literally no quests in world and yea, horde seemed way more compact. However, I kept leveling ally and somehow, I made a way to level characters pretty easy and fast. I switched to horde after and it felt really bad and suddenly ally side seemed better. In conclusion, the prefference is based on what you are used to. Both sides are good. Ally side has great leveling path and easy quests. I can tell you my whole 1-60 path if u like. You will never struggle with leveling as ally again... About the instances, yea horde is better with this. RFK, RFD, SM, Mara, all closer to horde. I find this however, just a tiny, not an important detail, since most of the dungs are run 1x only during the leveling phase anyway. Rather keep those, and we will have whole MC just 1min from IF.
---
If you wan't to speed run then don't do class quests.
---
If you want to continue playing after you reach level 60 then do class quests.
---
The only exceptions are the paladin and warlock level 40 class quests that give you your mount, because those quests are literally just 2 clicks.
---
I’ve got two guilds I’ve played with and a group of real life friends and I would like to manipulate all of them into playing on one server. This will take a bit of time...
---
While leveling or at 60?
---
While leveling there's a technique where you utilize both melee hits and shooting bow. IF I were to use that, then yes I would need on weapons that works well for the technique. For stats sticks? No I would not.
---
At 60: I would need on preBiS stat sticks yes regardless if it's other people's preBiS too. Dal'rend and even HoJ(BiS until phase2) will be mne.
---
Its going to limit casuals to either PVP or PVE IMO.  It's hard to say what impact 50g respecs will have without know what % of the pop is casuals.  I think casuals will be higher than most folks expect.
---
Updated!
---
I've leveled in vanilla many times. The guide \*taps temple\*  is up here.
---
I wont be realm first, as my route is an accumulation of 15 years of playing old world wow, not a prescribed route. But having done every quest at least once and having leveled at least 4 times to 60 on each faction im not worried. 
---
But the arrow helps. On my 3rd day, after a long shitty day of work, maybe I forget where some quest objectives are in Hinterlands. On pservers youve got the arrow so if you forget you just look up on your screen. On classic wow, ill have to open the quest log and read on the off chance I forget.
---
r/classicwow shit-talks r/wow so often that I really am fine with them heckling us a bit.
---
We'll see who is laughing though once that ded gaem is gone and WoW Classic has claimed its rightful place atop the top video games of all-time list! (/s?)
---
Guy was the first 'insane' I saw. Incredible how I can remember such things from more than ten years ago
---
So in that server, that amulet which wasn't even able to drop anymore was less rare than the ateish in vanilla.
---
good question.  i think most of my friends are going ally so i will do that.  it slightly impacts my choice since i might do war as horde cause i do love me some WF.  i also have to be honest with myself and realize i cant play as much as i did 15 yrs ago and mage prob performs better at lesser gear levels than war/lock
---
DHKs were hated by EVERYONE back then. 
---
  They also weren't at the start, so no DHK are also vanilla like.  
---
  The question is which follows vanilla game philosophy better and the answer is obviously no DHK, or at the very least, some sort of changed DHK.  
---
  DHK just completely kill any city pvp and high chance to do the same with world pvp.  
---
  If people want to grief they will do it DHK or not while people that want to do pvp raids and world pvp are discouraged by being massively overpunished for someone else decision.
---
&gt;Stopping portals isn't stopping the legions entirety.
---
No, but if the Heroes of Azeroth keep shutting portals down and killing off high tier demon lords then maybe they can stop the portals all together, then, no more legion. Even then, it doesn't matter if they killed the entire legion or not. They kept them out of Azeroth. Which no other world the Legion has ever made contact with has ever done.
---
He can hire a maid with all that money.
---
atlas will probably make a heroic comeback
---
Related to this: I remember 60 warlocks bringing max level enslaved demons (or maybe it was them spawning the doomguard?) in Crossroads to unleash holy hell on horde newbies. Was this still mechanically possible in 1.12 or also only a relic of a previous patch?
---
I also remember that there was some kind of extra powerful silver elite infernal demon at the bottom of a non-instanced mini dungeon in Felwood that warlocks could enslave and become gods of world PvP and PvE in the zone. I saw it live once in vanilla and whispered the warlock asking how he did it but he never responded to me. I also vaguely recall this same “feature” showing up in a WoW video during the pre-YouTube days which I’ve been unable to locate anywhere recently.
---
Basically warlocks were the kings of shenanigans back in vanilla and I REALLY want to know the extent to which that will remain true in Classic WoW.
---
Lmao true
---
TW used to scale everyone to the same ilevel so your gear didn't matter, did that change?
---
So we're just shitting on our friends now?
---
Nice.
---
People were still trying this in to BC thinking the Caverns of Times RP event in Hillsbrad has something to do with it, since it had Highlord Alexandros Morgraine in it.
---
Man WoW used to be so freaking cool I am excited for this stuff to come back!
---
Honestly things I am going to miss are things I don't use much but I get em as real QoL upgrades.  
---
Mounts Tab, Pets Tab, Soulshard Stacking
---
I basically won't bother getting pets because they take up inventory, I won't bother collecting multiple mounts for the same reason. I won't ever main a warlock because soul shards don't stack.
---
I am being picky to find something that I can truly say I am not looking forward to classic because of X,Y,Z.
---
All the other things I am straight fine with and I am looking forward too.
---
Well except maybe 50G respec costs. Oh well I have learned to Farm post-vanilla. So I will be better prepared this time around.
---
The game was made in 2004 for people who had never played mmos before. 
---
just play it. What other blizzard title has ever been inaccessible?
---
Now the data is not in yet on this but I'm going to make an educated guess and say this is what is called a "joke".  A *meme* if you will and a top class one at that.
---
Depending on how much you have played in the past you may have to train your brain to appreciate the value in the more time costly accomplishments in vanilla
---
Loot council where each week a few regular members are included for transparency. Spreadsheet to track attendance.
---
Yeah.... do that on a pickpocket target. No matter how you rotate that argument, the inherit auto loot feature is going to be a pretty significant buff to rogue gold making =)
---
"We realized something that makes an mmo a lot of fun for players, is not feeling like they're funneled through content like they only have one choice at one time." What happened to this mindset in retail wow? At what point didn't that matter anymore? This is one of many ideas that generates money for a company in the long run because they satisfy the players, giving them a reason to explore more, which leads to spending more time in the game. We need more of those masterminds in the gaming industry!
---
Was looking for something like this.
---
Reckoning Bomb some cloth wearers in Tarren Mill to take out the sting
---
Respec was a big problem back then, it was lowered several times because it just wasn't very well designed.  
---
  Sure, it's good to keep a player on a spec and make him grow with it, but it reaches a point where it stops serving that use and it instead becomes oppressive and detrimental to the game.  
---
  I'm sure we would've seen a lot more experimentation if it wasn't so expensive to do so.
---
I'm the lone American in my EU friend base, I'll have to search around for some NA friends. : p  I've had enough 160 ping BFA gameplay to last me a lifetime.
---
Sure, if you know that the lower dps person will actually get the 75 dps out of the item, then that would be most beneficial to the raid. I think the point being made, however, is that some people are able to use their gear more effectively than others. 
---
Simulated dps does not equal actual dps. With some exceptions, your high dps raiders are probably the ones who know how to get the most out of their gear. Lower dps players are probably not playing as much, keeping them from collecting good gear in the first place, or maybe they just don't know how to use all the tricks and tools that the high dps players do.
---
April 2017 their stock price was at $52.25. April 2019 their stock price was at $47.28.
---
Compared to their competition EA April 2017 $94.82 and April 2019 $101.83.
---
EA has been able to recover from the late 2018 shitstorm, while Blizzard appears to have plateaued. This is something that is worrisome for any shareholder that has stock in Blizzard. The stock isn’t terrible, but they need to show they’re not stuck in the mud. A release of WoW Classic to bump sub numbers up in early/mid summer, followed by the new CoD game could get them back in the competition.
---
Q4 shareholders meeting they noted that player count is reduced from BFA expansion. We can not prove this because they do not post numbers anymore, but they did come out and say subs were down.
---
I love druids (my retail main was one) but the stats you get from Atiesh is almost exactly the same as you get from the KT mace and Sapph eye combo, as I recall it's only a few less stats (same healing power and mp5).  With that in mind it's much more useful to the raid in the hands of the other 3 classes, except maybe for a feral.
---
Outlands and northrend were also intended to be in classic wow.
---
yeah, but that still doesnt show where you are on the map.  Not a big problem in 'flat' dungeons, but for the dungeons with a bunch of different levels it can be really shitty.
---
the best race is whichever one you think looks coolest
---
When I'm done all of them, I'll do a new post.
---
What do you mean by use one to find the next?
---
The overpopulation of quest zones during launch week.
---
#&lt;The Reckless&gt;
---
Realm/Type: US/Eastern, PVP
---
Faction: Horde
---
Guild Type: Adult Casual Raiding - We all have lives, kids, and jobs. Raiding will be done EST evenings during the week. No rush. DKP will be used. 
---
We're a multi game community w/many gaming servers online.
---
Contact myself either here on reddit, or join our discord @ [http://discord.thereckless.net](discord.thereckless.net)
---
Full T2.5 and Staff of Shadow Flame or better on my warlock. Then I retire that main and PvP casually.
---
Iirc DBM existed for most of Vanilla so I doubt your hope comes true.
---
Weapon skills. I’m a no changes guy, but man, I hated leveling with swords as a rogue and then a REALLY nice mace drops, and... welp... time to go auto-attack some mobs forever while I level the skill. Even worse when you’re a Druid, shift to heal in a hard fight, but then are too oom to shift back, so you hit with your staff and miss, miss, miss, dead.
---
I love it but the weight given to DKs is ridiculous
---
This is my hope is they rescale tbc and wtolk content to 60. They had intended to have outlands and northrend on vanilla wow launch. But time ya. I just hope with the hindsight they have they make a even better game.
---
Nice list! I've posted [my spam](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bde04x/looking_for_group_monday_april_15_2019/el1irwc/) if you wouldn't mind adding it
---
&gt;I will be mostly tanking
---
'Scuse you?
---
Exhalted with all of the things
---
Modern WoW and really all modern MMOs just seem so  bereft of journey to me.
---
You can always just jump right in to the current content, I remember going back in to BRD to attune a new recruit to MC like maybe a month before TBC launched. 
---
You needed bodies in raids and it made you continue to value people beyond the dps meter.
---
[Hunter](https://streamable.com/3c4vo)
---
I've done both recently and I would still put my money on hunters.
---
Voidwalker threat is too weak, I was constantly pulling aggro whenever I would shadow bolt which basically rendered my 30 sp enchant useless. 
---
Add in the 30% speed that hunters get at lvl 20 and it's not even that close.
---
Sure, but what sort of argument is that for an item that may grace your guild once and only once all progression is done?
---
Mages/Locks cant make a good argument as what they already have was good enough to kill the last boss of the expansion.
---
Priests/Druids cant make a good argument cause whatever they were healing with was good enough to kill the last boss of the expansion.
---
An item like a legendary, especially one like Atiesh that has absolutely no bearing on progression, has a much weaker case being decided on a pure utilitarian metric. 
---
If its a 3 year 40-60 man dedicated journey to killing KT, then arent all mages, locks, priests, druids who have been there the entire time, who've shown up, farmed, healed, dpsed, theorycrafted, etc. equally worthy?
---
The case for TF is clear, its a weapon that helps the guild kill bosses the rest of the expansion, if put on the MT. 
---
Hand of Rag and Atiesh assignment require a more human touch, I feel.
---
Seeing Kazzak in SW once or twice would be awesome.  Seeing him kited to SW everytime he spawns would get old pretty fast.
---
im pretty sure there was an addon for that back in the day. a lot of these qol changes will come in the form of addons since thats where a lot of them originated in the first place
---
You sir, are a very smart man.
---
Yeah I was leveling there on a private server a few weeks ago and I fucking hated it. There was one graveyard and it was nowhere near the the harpies or alliance area.
---
Ah I thought you meant godmode damage dealers. My bad.
---
DKP is a pain for the leaders to maintain. It just gets to be more of a job than a game. 
---
I would advise you to take it easy. Do some rolls, do some voice chat counsel. Once you have been going for a while and you seem to have 40 ish steady players you can go DKP if you still think it is worth it. 
---
Don't burn out your best players by putting too much on thier shoulders or your own.
---
Well, getting an epic drop before 60 on your first character on a realm was the easiest way to get that epic mount... &gt;P
---
Jeff omg come back to WoW
---
Was too chicken to raid in vanilla. This time around shooting for:
---
\- 1 Ony kill
---
\- 1 Rag kill
---
the anticipation!
---
Good time to start fresh. None of my retail friends are playing anymore or they are but dont plan to play classic. So kind of excited to start fresh and find a new crew.
---
Announcing the date could pull people away from retail earlier, losing a few months of revenue. You see similar population patterns in games/servers that go through progression resets, like the survival genre (minecraft, 7 days, ark etc). Even if people know a wipe is coming the population doesn't drop until a date is announced.
---
The timing of the next content patch gives even more weight to this. If they announce the date before the content patch then some players may choose to skip that content entirely, knowing that they will quit for classic so shortly after.
---
Can human mages take most class/race combos from horde?
---
how does that work? do they play the brown note?
---
Fury and prot warriors? Needs to respec to PvP remotely well.
---
Combat rogues? One of the worst PvP specs in the game.
---
31arcane frost mages with arcane power for pewpew in raids? Absolute shit in PvP.
---
Most classes have to respec to do well in PvP.
---
The only drawback of healers is gear. A resto shaman will just not get ToEP or Neltharios Tear, because its DPS class prio.
---
But class/specs like elemental shamans get great DPS gear from PvP reputation reward and tier sets, so it's not too bad.
---
Still seems like a lot of awapping to me, but to each his own. You'll be leveling tailoring three times, herbalism twice and seemingly everytihng else at least once (except LW and BS).
---
 /roll a clutch 100 in raid
---
I level cap characters until I have one of everything. Max professions so they are all productive and gear them up to a point where I'm satisfied with them, be that tier gear, pvp, whatever.
---
I do also retire characters once they have reached their intended goals.
---
It's already claimed the top spot in our hearts (actually our brain reward circuits?). And that is all that really matters (/s?!)
---
You joke, but that’s exactly what happened with Runescape 3 when old school RuneScape was brought back. Now runescape 3 (the main game) has 10% of the player base of Old school. (10,000 vs 100,000)
---
I've been spoiled by looting all corpses at once.  Although in vanilla I won't be killing more than one mob at once, so I guess it isn't too big of a deal.
---
Killer combo. Lots of dps w heals and tank. I would say we should join up but I think I’m rolling Orc Rogue 🤪
---
Your gear system matters a lot less than developing a culture in your guild that mitigates people’s focus on loot.
---
The best guilds I have ever been in have always been the ones that more or less made you feel like loot didn’t matter, they focused on fostering a since of team progress being the only progress that mattered. Gear is a means to an end if you can get most of your raiders on side with that idea you’ll be able to build something great.
---
It’s going to be harder now though since personal loot has been a massive focus of the game since Wrath.
---
10 days is two weeks when you account for regular days off.
---
and you picked the best race for priest :)
---
Legion had a very smooth launch. I had a bugged quest that stopped me from progressing my beast mastery story, but aside from that I had no problems. 
---
Dunno about BfA as I couldn't log in that week, but presumably they kept the tech that let them have good launches.
---
As, nice try, sweetie
---
Desolace gives 1,5 level to ally character, who will do all the quests. Not the best, definitely not bad tho.
---
Why make the assumption that'll happen? What it will do is create possibilities of a lot of epic world pvp battles. If you see someone trying to kite him, interfere. Kill the hunter. Grab Kazzak from him. Maybe massive pvp battles will happen as a result. All kinds of spontaneous events could come from it.
---
I'd rather see new surprises, than people chain exploiting the old ones that were fixed. What made them great is what the OP said. Running into stuff like kited mobs, internals in lowbie areas, or exploding felhounds for the first time was both shocking and amazing, especially if low level at the time and had never seen the mobs or effects before. Even if I appreciate something the 5th or 50th time I see it, it doesn't blow my mind like it did the first or second time.
---
It's automated detection, something like using 30 seconds or more of a song will trigger it iirc. The person who owns the music can decide to take down the video or slap an ad on it and take 100% of the ad revenue (even if you don't run ads normally). Honestly just look it up online, this isn't really a classic wow specific thing. There's like a million threads suggesting free publicly available music alternatives for creators to use.
---
I’m assuming this is and Zul Plague will be fixed in Blizzards Classic WoW :(
---
People are still talking about this in 2019. How could that not be positive?
---
Yeah, that factored in slightly.  Well, moreso it helped secure the decision i was leaning towards.
---
Probably meant fund
---
Fingers crossed!
---
This is the mind set that got us retail.  "Gimme shit for free"  
---
I understand there are real life responsibilities but this isnt the solution.  Dont pvp or dont pve if you dont have time for it all.
---
up to r9 its pretty easy if you play a bit of pvp, at least on most servers the jump from 9-&gt; 10 is a bit harder but if you just play that week hard you should hit it
---
Tauren Hunter with full T1, rhok de'lar, zihn rhok. Favorite class, favorite tier set, favorite sword
---
The inability to look at other peoples talent trees. Always loved looking at higher levels and other classes just to see what they have.
---
What is this, and how do I do it?
---
I learned from Legion that expac launches can be smooth. BfA was also relatively smooth for the first few hours too. 
---
Blizz can have smooth launches these days and I would still probably try and play on launch day. Why not? If the server is down or unstable, I can just play one of my many other games.
---
For real.  I was thinking about how much time I will have to play once classic launches and realized that I can increase that amount by like 10 hours per week by just playing the game instead of reading other people talk about how they want to play the game, haha.
---
...and kite it to Stormwind as a Horde player.
---
I had fun with it :D
---
Mage ore lock Are strong choice to pick
---
ElvUI, Questie, Auctinator/Auctioneer
---
I received one on my warlock on a pserver.
---
You have to first convince the 39 other people you're worthy of receiving the item (being a guild officer or leader aids in this part).
---
Second, you have to consistently kill bosses in Naxxramas who each have somewhere around an 8-15% drop rate (not sure the exact rate, depends on your source of info) of 1 splinter.  You need 40 splinters in total to assemble the frame.  On average I would say it took about 2.5 months of raiding Naxx to complete 40 splinters.
---
Once you have 40 splinters you assemble the frame and accept the quest the item gives.  That will send you to Tanaris to speak with Anachronos.  He will give you the next part of the quest chain: To retrieve the Base of Atiesh from C'Thun in AQ40, and the Head of Atiesh from Kel'Thuzad (final boss in Naxxramas).
---
Once you have the staff base and head, you will head back to Anachronos in Tanaris who will assemble a version of the staff.  This item will need to be taken to Stratholme to cleanse the taint of Sargeras.
---
You will then have to gather 4 of your strongest friends to go to Stratholme.  Once inside you will need to summon and defeat Atiesh &lt;Hand of Sargeras&gt; who is a medium size demon that hits like a truck, and has a continuous shadow damage aura that hits everyone.  During this encounter the demon can be disarmed (which reduces his damage greatly) and also causes him to drop a temporary legendary sword \[Andonisus, Reaper of Souls\] that can be wielded by anyone that can use a sword (ideally a fury warrior who will push more dps and help the tank keep Atiesh disarmed).
---
Once he has been defeated you head back to Tanaris to talk to Anachronos one last time.  He will bestow the staff upon you, which you can then use to teleport all your friends to celebrate at Karazhan.
---
Question about pvp rank. So I know already I won't have time to hit Rank 14, as I have a job. But what rank do you need to get the armor sets?
---
I'm big on PvP but don't intend to seriously participate in the PvP ranking system. It's a writeoff for me, I'll enjoy Classic for its strengths. Competitive PvP was not one of its strengths. 
---
99% of people won't spend the massive amount of time necessary to get the purple PvP gear, and even casual raiding beats the blue PvP gear (which isn't easy to get either). So with that consideration, a lot of people won't care too much about DHKs, hopefully.
---
thanks!
---
Dat Track Humanoids in Stormwind.
---
True, and even though I know that, and that I most certainly will get to experiance what I want regardless of class/spec, the min/maxer in me cries out in pain at playing a less then optimal class haha
---
The human to the left us about to jump the hell out of there X)

1) Run dungeons with your RL friends. 
---
2) Get Benediction for my priest. 
---
3) Level my elemental shaman to 60 as my PvP alt. 
---
4) Handful of rep grinds. 
---
5) Be around for the AQ opening. 
---
6) Join in for at least one world boss kill.
---
Warrior and rogue.
---
they already said that the mailbox will be more legion like (sending multiple items at once), so they might also change the auto-loot option
---
I’ve played this game long enough to know that if this is possible you’ll see him in September very often
---
Hellfire Peninsula had me seeing red. Kappa
---
Imo he wrecked a large part of the best years of his life sinking so many hours into wow. Heck I don't know the guy but seems like a waste of youth.
---
It's very difficult to police that though. If the system was simply designed better, they wouldn't have to.
---
I'm excited too. I've got a career and everything, plenty of saved up PTO. 
---
But, I'm not about to go full on gaming-boomer status and spend an entire week of it on a videogame. Just seems silly to me. Summer is for the beach, the outdoors, and getting some sun, at least for me!
---
It's completely intended. You either farm the gold for respec or you level an alt.
---
Those take a lot of time? That's Vanilla for you. "Warts and all."
---
Not much of a curve. You'll be leveling from scratch so you'll learn the mechanics as you go. It's a slow process. And once you get used to the mechanics, there are always people around (especially on this sub) who will love to talk about the nuances if you're interested.
---
Tough.  Life's not fair.  Respec less, farm more, or consider playing a less respec dependent class.
---
ZF is just *so* far away if you have to leave someone in tb/org to spam "LF1M tank ZF, g2g" in /2.  If you don't have a lock to summon the last two group members, you can form the group and then you have to be like "ok cool, we'll meet at the entrance in 20 minutes."
---
But yeah, ZF isn't terrible once you get there.  My favorite pre-60 instance tbh.
---
The only filters I am finding are Sort A-&gt;Z or Z-&gt;A, and it is only applying to one column at a time.

Literally everyone is better off if healthcare is free, including yourself.
---
You can think of the total cost of healthcare in the USA as some big number, call it X.  Regardless of who has healthcare or not, people are going to get sick and they will go to hospitals and they will get treated.  Hospitals don't turn you away if you can't pay, they just treat you and then hit you with a bill that you'll never be able to pay off.

So hospitals have to save these people, but doing so costs the hospital money.  Where do they recoup the cost of saving these uninsured people?  One way is by increasing the price of all their services for the people who *do* have insurance, like you.  Which means the insurance agency increases the premiums that *you* have to pay in order to stay covered.
---
So essentially, you're being double-dipped.  You're *already* paying the cost of the healthcare for all the uninsured people who get treated, you're just doing it in a roundabout way that makes it harder to see and you're putting the entire USA healthcare burden on people like you who have insurance.
---
Switching to single payer would solve lots of problems with this.  First off, the cost of healthcare would go down.  Right now the cost of healthcare is being divided up and paid for by the people who have private insurance, which is not everyone.  Under single payer the same cost would be paid for by literally everyone in the USA who pays taxes.  Since the number of people in the USA who pay taxes is greater than the number of people who currently have private health insurance, the cost per person would necessarily go down.
---
Yes, you would pay more in taxes, but the amount you would save by not having to pay for health insurance would be greater, resulting in you having more money.  Do you want to have more money than you have now?  Then you should support single payer.
---
Second, it would allow the government to act as a single negotiating entity for setting prices.  This would result in prices going down accross the board for treatment and medication, furthering the amount of money you get to keep for yourself.
---
Thirdly, it would give you greater freedom in choosing what job you work.  Nobody would be slaves to their current job because they don't want to lose their healthcare coverage.  Nobody would have to deal with the fear or anxiety that comes with losing their job and not knowing if they'll be able to get medical treatment if they need it.  Nobody with pre-existing conditions would be chained to their current job because if they leave to pursue a better opportunity at a different job they won't be able to get coverage again.  Even if this doesn't apply to you right now, keep in mind that you never know what will happen, it could apply to you someday.  Do you want more freedom in choosing what job you want to work?  Then you should support single payer.
---
Finally, it would likely improve the state of your country on the whole because living in a country where people don't have to worry about dying in the street because they couldn't pay for their insulin is almost certainly better than living living in a country where that kind of thing happens.  And if you don't like the coverage that the government provides, you can always still opt for a private healthcare plan even if a single payer option exists.
---
There is literally no good reason, in 2019, to be opposed to single payer healthcare.  Whether you're coming from a place of moral rightenousness and wanting what's best for everyone or from extreme selfishness and just wanting what's best for yourself, single payer seems to be the best option all around.
---
It depends on what situation your are looking at, stale fight, warrior/mage
---
Partially yes, but when you have to make the decision of who will get the first set of splinters most guilds will still have quite a bit of progressing still to do; it is true that to complete it you do have to actually KT.  The benefit to the raid would really only apply if you continue doing that as a guild for some time afterward, allowing your raid to benefit from the aura for subsequent raid clears.
---
LazyPig,  Titan Panels, Luna Unit Frames, Decursive, vQueue would make my life complete.

R10 for full blue. R13 for full epic. 
---
R10 is very doable if you like PvPing a modest 8 hours a week for a few months ,depending how competitive the server is.
---
I hope they block anything that tries to determine item level.
---
all of the things you mentioned are things that should only be considered when using a loot council system, not a roll
---
OMG yes, i was in Ferelas today and got back to Camp Mojache with the 5 quests i had complete and it was mighty satisfying xD
---
They can be buffed normally like other party members, but group buffs dont apply to them, so they rarely get buffed. World buffs, as far as I remember dont work (and dont on pservers either).
---
What's the name of that amulet? Do you have a link?
---
I know people who had both Atiesh and Ashbringer, Ashbringer was more common.  The event was cool.  The Atiesh quests were funner.
---
Our guild pulled Lethon to Org. So many shadowbolts.
---
I thought I pressed greed was driving me insane back in the days...
---
I hate DHKs, but I also think enemy towns should be safe havens for them. It's dorky as fuck to see someone just standing in the middle of Grom'gol killing everyone.
---
The better solution would just be something like making "civilians" immune, or causing them to spawn extremely dangerous guards if attacked (like warmaster level).
---
Easy scooter. I’m not saying make any changes. I’m just saying that me, personally, would like it if I could spend more of my free time playing BGs with my friends instead of sitting in the middle of nowhere farming gold. 
---
I’m not advocating anything be actually changed. I’m only conveying my personal opinions. Surely you can empathize with that at least a little.
---
mmm, fart gas
---
I would definitely be interested in this if you find it/if you want to collaborate! Drop me a PM and we can talk.
---
It's not hard at all and don't worry about "embarrassing" yourself.
---
If people give you shit, find others who don't. You'll enjoy yourself much more with those kind of players even after you get good.
---
Obviously getting really good takes time but that's Vanilla is about having a lot of fun playing a lot. :)
---
It took a month of full clears to get, too.  With 1 player getting every shard.  Definitely not something seen all too often.
---
Lol i bet you’re a fun guy
---
I just want to be the coolest and fastest Druid in WSG.
---
Are you hard stuck on playing warrior? or may I convince you into playing a dwarf rogue tank? It satisfies the min/max mindset you are looking for and requires a dedicated and skillful guild.
---
The reasoning is more like: "why bring some dipshit with a memespec that brings nothing of value over someone who does?" 
---
It's not about whether bosses die or not, but rather an unwillingness to carry these shitters. Anectdotally, someone in a memespec is never actually trying hard, they're just all-around entitled shit tier players.
---
I'm yet to be proven wrong.
---
http://wow.allakhazam.com/wiki/spell_coefficient_(wow) pretty much slower spells get more damage bonus from spellpower
---
Loot council for pve gear and free roll / dkp for pvp gear imo was always best.
---
It has a point. You're not supposed to be good at everything.
---
Thank fuck.
---
Usually we were getting them on Thursdays weren't we?
---
Mage is great because food and water priest is the 3rd most gear dependant class in the game. If you don't have a good wand you're fucked.
---
I mostly want LazyPig. I believe Many aspects of Move Anything are native in WoW now.
---
I assume instead of using websites/addons this time around, a discord bot might work even better.
---
It works for Flametongue and other spells, as for procs, I believe its supposed to, but ive heard a lot of debate as to whether SP Rogue actually worked or not back in retail rather than pservers (which uses this mechanic). But no, it doesnt just add 20 straight damage, its based on spell coefficient (ie. like 10% of the actually spell power gain)
---
Talisman of the Binding Shard https://www.wowhead.com/item=17782/talisman-of-binding-shard
---
&gt; It's a shame most other casuals weren't willing to get better as they missed out on such a personal gain.
---
The issue wasn't casual players, it was LFD, hard dungeons with matchmaking has basically never worked in WoW, even in retail today, mythic and mythic + are not part of the LFG tool.  As with so many things in wow, LFD, LFR, LFG ruined a lot of what made the game great.  I will always argue there is no bigger mistake they made in this game than adding matchmaking for pve content.  The dungeon finder tool in TBC was a really good compromise, and is definitely as far as they should have gone.
---
Please mark this NSFW. Too sexy
---
Retail is available currently.  You don't ha e to wait for classic.
---
You gotta let go of the min maxer in you. Save it for another expansion. Or i mean you can play the game how you want, but once you learn to stop giving a fuck about what some spreadsheet says or where you rank on the dps chart vanilla just becomes so chill.
---
I doubt there will be that many, by now most people should know how it is.
---
*laughs in unison*
---
Druids cannot rez, and indeed it can be considered a negative as a healer. If you build your group right it really shouldn't matter though.
---
Even more important is that you can do all three roles regardless of your spec while leveling. So while it might be a negative that you don't have a rez as a healer, it's a huge plus that you can battle rez as a tank/dps.
---
so if you're doing a dungeon, druids are able to heal just fine but if someone dies they will either have to walk back or you bring with you a dps shaman or priest since hybrids are fine enough in 5 man's.  and they can rez.
---
It's annoying, but worst case the party makes a run back. Same as a wipe. Healers aren't in such large supply that groups will be turning them down.
---
Not for Legion or Bfa logged in without issue. (I think WoD went fine too except quest spawns).
---
Consider it a character building experience.
---
Well, it's been an hour....
---
What did it say?
---
I can't comment on the rare infernal but warlocks have a LONG cooldown infernal summon they can use for normal ones.  Also ritual of doom and curse of doom can spawn doom guards in low level zones.
---
I don't remember being unable to let loose infernals in goldshire at any point in vanilla.

Classic is a lot more fun in a ton of different ways. I just happen to not like this one thing. 
---
Anyways, good talk. Have a good one.
---
They weren't though.  That's the problem.  They need to police it far, far better than they did in vanilla and *certainly* far better than it is policed on pservs......and they need to do this in a time when they're actively stating they want to have less GM interaction with teh game and cutting support staff.  These two things do not give me warm fuzzies about the ranking system....and I say this as someone that loves pvp and ranked up to 10...just short of 11 while actively progression raiding in vanilla.
---
Speaking for myself here, but mythic plus is not what I want in an MMO, never ending difficulty tiers isn't content, nor is it the form of difficulty I want, and it only works in the completely broken gearing system WoW has had in the last two expansion.  This was Diablo brought to WoW, and it's one of the many issues with the current incarnation of WoW.
---
Yeah I mean legendaries are a tricky thing, socially. 
---
And someone who put in the time will certainly feel shafted somewhere. 
---
I just think you need to take the person into consideration more, not the avatar in game--if that makes sense. Boosting Mage 1's damage after progression is over is meaningless. Rewarding your tight knit guildmembers with a rogue getting the 3rd TF, or that OT who loves pvp but always had to spend his dkp on tanking gear (which he had 3rd priority on) and was never in a position to snag a new hottness 2h--give him your 2nd Hand of Rag. Whatever.   
---
I didn't play enough naxx to know how often fragments come out. But I am pretty sure we will have longer in classic naxx than we had in vanilla naxx. With the increase in player skill, resulting in more players killing more bosses sooner, and the longer window--having 2 atiesh maybe 3? After 6-9+ months on farm doesnt seem unreal.  (I hope they announce classic BC, but give us like a ICC/SOO length content stall after Naxx opens).
---
We had multiple ValAnyar and Shadowmourne in our guild in Wrath (but im sure drop rates were higher).
---
Classic is way more fun in a lot of different ways. I just happen to not like this thing. 
---
Anyways, good talk. Have a good one bud!
---
Think its dryads
---
*lol*
---
Just throwing it out here: when I raided pretty hard in tbc we had a loot council/dkp system. The tanks and healers were loot counciled, the dps used dkp with weekly decay. The class leaders were supposed to oversee the process.  
---
I was a rogue class leader at that point, and had pretty good dialogue with the class leaders who shared tier-tokens (obviously not a case in vanilla). And those who shared weapon stats. 
---
We used to have weekly meetings between class leaders discussing the raiders, on who needed what and who were performing well.  We then adviced our raiders what to bid on or pass on. 
---
This resulted in a pretty good “team-spirit”, as us rogues passed on something the warriors needed, and vice versa. Loot was never an issue.
---
You don't like working for the things you want.  Retail.

We used hidden bid dkp. You bid on the item in whisper to raid leaddr and won it If you vid highest.
---
The cost was something like The 2nd highest bid plus 15 dkp (you got 5 dkp per boss, 15 dkp per boss on progress raids/Bosses we only downed once or twice)
---
If only you bid the items had specific dkp costs (ranged from 15 to 50)
---
We had no decay because that made no sense.
---
The total cost was always announced and everyones dkp was shown in a forum thread so there could be no shady bussiness.

Classic is a complete world, like any great RPG the quests, dungeons and raids of Classic WoW guide you through a series of increasingly difficult challenges some which can be over come with skill or dedication but others that will require you to reach out to your fellow players. Being a part of a largely unforgiving world forces players to band together to progress. 
---
Modern WoW has mostly stripped away these challenges in favor of making the game more accessible to the average player, you don’t need to be in a guild and groups for content are only ever a queue away. All the meaning has been drained out of the game beyond chasing that next piece of gear.
---
It's a law you have to /flirt with princess before the fight
---
Maybe there’s a state law that gives you a minimum but I don’t think there’s a two week minimum under US/federal law.
---
There won't be much of a learning curve, the main thing you're going to need to get over is you mostly gotta handle 1  mob at a time solo, and maybe up to 3 elite mobs tops in an instance with your group (although typically you'll want to cc one of them). You're not an unstoppable machine like you are in BfA. The other thing is aggro, if you're a tank learn how to take aggro, if you're DPS then just be sure you're not using aggro abilities. 
---
You'll have a blast!
---
And I guess grid and clique since I'm rolling healer and have used those forever as well.
---
If you're tanking, having a rez is like a bonus as the main healer will be doing most of it. Plus druids are great tanks; only other one with an actual taunt. Good to go.
---
Because I only played vanilla for a month when I was a kid and have no idea what I'm doing, only that I know I want to help other low-level folk but don't know how best to go about it. :|
---
Then another team mate rolls 100 as well, and on the reroll you get a single digit number, lose the loot, and then pretend everything is OK while the guy that got the loot screams in extacy

BFA's launch was flawless. I experienced literally nothing negative.
---
Legion's launch was flawless. I experienced literally nothing negative.
---
WoD's launch was slightly shaky, but was fine after the first couple hours. It was only a problem just outside the Garrisons, but I had no issues after leaving that area after the initial bundle of quests.
---
What I'm saying is the last 3 expansion launches have been solid. There's definitely an argument to be made that Classic will likely bring more numbers initially than an expansion launch, but everyone will also be spread among 6 different starting zones and they're going to be utilizing phasing for launch. I'm not anticipating a week (lol?) of unplayability.
---
IIRC a part of the key chain for BRD required you to be dead to talk to a dwarf ghost on the way down to the instance
---
Our server had zero by TBC release. My alt server had 1. I don't think there's ever been a rarer item, save for the 1-guy exclusive legendary neck from MC.
---
It's ok tiger.  The truth hurts sometimes.  You can lash out at me if makes you feel better.
---
There are still multiple guilds farming Naxx on LB to this day. Almost no logic to it but they enjoy it and they want their full T3 or whatever until the lights go out on that server. 
---
It won't be every guild that clears Naxx that will continue farming long enough to get more than one or two Atieshes, but they'll be out there.
---
Definitely of mixed feelings about PvP. On the one hand, it's "more realistic" for the enemy faction to attack you. On the other, all too many people, think that PvP is killing grey level players who don't have a chance to fight back. And being ganked for no reason other than for some asshole getting his jollies just annoys me. Also, I like to play both horde and alliance. And with Vanilla, that means different servers since you couldn't have characters for both factions on PvP servers.
---
History lesson:
---
Transfers from PvE to PvP was prohibited until Sep 13, 2008, about 1 month before WotLK (see [this announcement](https://web.archive.org/web/20080913213732/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=9679894519&amp;sid=1))

Having characters from both factions on PvP servers prohibited until Aug 4, 2009, patch 3.2.0 (see [this announcement](https://web.archive.org/web/20090806075034/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=19110291048&amp;pageNo=1))
---
Personally, I disagree with Blizzard ever allowing PvE to PvP transfers. Makes it all too easy to hit level cap on a PvE server, then go ganking on a PvP server. The prohibition of having both factions on PvP servers was all too easily bypassed by having multiple accounts. And it's my understanding that the reason Blizzard removed the restriction was because they were about to offer paid cross faction transfers. And by removing the restriction, they could allow that on PvP servers as well (more $$$ for them).

If pserver rates are any indication, it would take on average about 2.5-3 months or so to gather 40 splinters.
---
Yes. There are YouTube videos with instructions out there.
---
I am refering to the point of the Game not being playable due to a huge que for the most part.
---
I play on a High Pop server and It's insane to see a +3k long que on launch for the first week and at Legion it was almost two weeks.

Now imagine a limited amount of servers and a huge influx of new players and old ones.

I agree DM can be tough. The foundry area can quickly turn into a shit show. If your tank doesn't pull Smite back a little ways the tank's going to get stomped while everyone is stunned. If you're too low level you can pull the goblin mini boss from the lower level. The pirates on the boat can run and aggro Cookie and several others. It's going to be interesting to see how inexperienced groups go.

Maybe. Maybe you come up with something nobody had thought of so far. I doubt it, I dont deny it. But I certainly dont see the point of doing through the whole process when its allready there. If you have done that and found a solution that adresses all the problems - I would be eager to read it.

While Stoneform is objectively better than Perception, of all the classes, it really makes the least difference for Paladins. Bleeds are pretty irrelevent in PvP, Devouring Plague is the only disease and the only 2 poisons you really need to deal with are crippling and blind. Assuming youre holy reckoning, youre likely just standing in place anyways and even if not, then you have BoF. You can also cleanse crippling poisons, giving you multiple ways to deal with it. The only time youre really going to need to cleanse crip is if your moving, which at that point, the GCD is almost irrelevent because you cant cast while youre moving and when youre not moving you dont need to remove crippling poison.
---
Devouring Plague is annoying, but again can be cleansed and it isnt easy for Priest to keep putting that up without depleting all his mana in about 3s, so it can actually be better to just bait him into using it on you.
---
Lastly, Blind, this is what Stoneform is great for, but thats really the only reason youre getting it. For a 10s CC that breaks easily, can be cleansed from you or broken with BoSac. In group fights youll almost always want BoSac on someone anyways. In 1v1, sure its an inconvenience, but since Rogue is a class that Paladin counter already, its not a major game changer.
---
Anyways, Stoneform is a convenience against Rogues as a Paladin, its certainly far from "insane" for Paladins. Warriors, Hunters and Rogues benefit from it far more than Paladins do and you shouldnt consider it equal for all classes.
---
There will be perfectly reasonable responses to most of the complaints, but that won't stop them from coming. I expect one of the most common to be, "It takes so long to level! Why can't I just buy a boost?"

As someone who hadn't experienced classic, that's one of the things that stood out to me from the demo. The graveyards seemed much more sparse, which really slowed down the experience.

---
&gt;Even less common than the Ashbringer since it was just a drop whereas Atiesh required multiple runs on top of good RNG.
---
Yet here we are, talking about him 10 years later
---
I mean, you need splinter's for Atiesh and even if Naxx is the last content patch people will still want that staff. You raid as a group/guild, not as an individual. Sure some people may leave, but I assume a lot of people will still want to farm Naxx for gear.
---
WRONG. You don't use slam as 2H fury, you use hamstring to proc windfury totem. 
---
2H fury on horde side is very viable if you got a good weapon. 2H fury with BRE is BiS until rank 14 weapons if you're horde. It's not very viable on alliance side, although it will be better than dual wield if you don't have good 1handers and low hit.

When I played Vanilla the guild usually covered all tank respecs/repairs, not sure if that will carry over to Classic but I suppose its a nice gesture of thanks. As for healers, I don't recall if they had their respec/repairs covered in my old guild but I doubt it.

This is seen as a late game situation, but with proper min/maxing you get 60% passive dodge chance, tackle on Bag of Marbles, Wail of the Banshee and typical debuffs and it allows you to tank most bosses out there.

There are many other weird and interesting specs similar to this that I talk about in detail in my videos. If you are interested, I'll shoot you a link.
---
I honestly want this to happen
---
I raided MC-AQ40 in vanilla and never had an epic mount lol.
---
Yep. Last scene where Happy is about to putt.
---
Mages are amazing in PvP and don't require good gear to do well, but still scales very well.
---
Which is why I stopped playing retail.
---
I assume you have no idea how contract bargaining works or how unions work in general. 
---
1.	Normally people are on probation for 6 months to a year. This probationary period gives the company an opportunity to sever ties with people who aren’t fit for the job. People on probation do not take vacation (unless there is a family emergency, etc.). 
---
2.	Contract bargaining is a give and take. Vacation use in the first year is something the company or union can use as leverage. 
---
3.	People in their first year are normally training full-time and the company does not want them taking too much time off which might set back their training. Again, there are special circumstances that are dealt with a case-by-case basis. 
---
4.	The people working in their first year still accrue vacation to use later on. 
---
Let me know if you want more reasons.
---
Well this sub compiled a list of about 150 guilds that cleared Naxx before BC was released. If you extrapolate from that and take a shot in the dark at the number of people that were able to pug their way through it in BC, it's hard to imagine more than 1000 of them being created in retail. And that seems quite generous.
---
Can be used by horde for faster travel to Blackrock mountain atleast. Port karazhan -&gt; ride to swamp of sorrows -&gt; fly burning steppes.
---
I’m actually looking forward to this
---
I hope they never announce a release date and it never comes out so I can live in a constant state of hype and anticipation
---
*Speculatively
---
If you plan to PvE, humans get sword and mace skill, which is really good. If you become the designated nightfall user, then it doesn't really matter.
---
entire game being released tomorrow surprise
---
Okay so each hit with Flametongue would get 2 more damage?
---
I'll take barrens chat over goldshire erp any day.
---
Would be amazing if they went the way of old school runescape and started content development/adding in unreleased vanilla stuff and taking the game in a totally different direction.
---
Hold ALT then 0153 on numpad and release  
---
™
---
Like what OSRS does.
---
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in toaster.
---
Socials welcome?
---
“I don’t have any rings so I need it”
---
HOW DO WE WANT IT
---
The walks are half of what make classic great IMO. Such a beautifully designed world with great music and ambiance.
---
Did you read literally any other part of his post or did you just read the first few words and write the stupidest shit you could make up in the smallest amount of time possible?
---
That does happen and with lower respec cost it's a benefit to everyone.
---
Those are items you can get once per character and have limited uses, and you plan to regularly tank raids with it?
---
I'll be seeing her hundreds of times on my Hunter
---
I'd greatly appreciate that, thank you!
---
I'm not looking forward to rets being absolutely shi'ite again. Played my ret since vanilla and still playing him today. Would love to recreate him again but this time around I wont do that mistake. They are fun but very very underwhelming and unfinished in vanilla.
---
https://i.redd.it/rimi8c8f0e711.png
---
Can't agree more :) #removeDHKs
---
Just don’t let anyone die. 
---
Seriously though, groups just want a healer. I have never been in a group that turned its nose up at a Druid.
---
I've decided to play a troll priest because I don't want to play a dwarf, but neither do I want a subpar race. So I'll play a faction where the priest racials are about equal
---
No shit ;)
---
For farming, absolutely the Drillborer, the Force Reactive Disk procs very often and itll be really expensive to maintain if you want to just use it for farming, although, yes the FRD will do more damage.
---
Drillborer has REFLECT, while Skullflame has PROC when hit. Drillborer averages out to a lot more damage than Skullflame.
---
PvP, Drillborer again, the FRD is only really good against groups, not so much against single, or a few targets.
---
I have yet to see that lmao do you have a clip?
---
Warriors. The downside is that they’re horrible with bad gear.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/caperfin
---
Keepers of the grove
---
I think thats the ballpark. You can google vanilla spell power coefficients for a list somewhere.
---
You're assuming it would be the opposing faction pulling him.
---
There are more gold farmers now than there ever were before wow tokens. There are more gold buyers now than there ever were before wow tokens. It legitimized gold farming/selling, it legitimized gold buying. It took away all the risk and so opened the floodgates. It completely ruined the in-game economy.
---
Play NE for the wisp
---
sure thing.
---
https://discord.gg/kg36zM
---
So many quests to keep track of lol
---
Oh then  I misunderstood. Yes, you'd definitely not want any proc weapons on a druid.
---
Hey, this is a great idea and I am very pleased to see the amount of work you are putting into it. My guild is Executive Crew, I am running it and it would be awesome if you could change the schedule to, 8:30PM Friday &amp; Saturday, make it a semi-casual guild, and the guild discord server is  [https://discord.gg/h36hGuB](https://discord.gg/h36hGuB)
---
Then you would be positively wrong because there isn't anything better before phase 2 for alliance.
---
Also rune of the guard captain was released in a later patch (like 1.8 or something) so depending on how they do itemization it might not be in phase 1
---
Yeah, that's the proper name, sons of Cenarius. Turns out Cenarius had a particularly low-standards son.
---
Added!
---
“Stam is good on all classes so I need”
---
Also that... Instant rage 100/100 when they said that.
---
There's some top tier stack stick items that Hunters should have priority or at least have a chance to roll on.  For example, the [Warblade of the Hakkari](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19865)
---
60 with some raid gear and a lot of pvp played, and a lot of pve stuff completed like class quests and professions maxed and an epic mount. Past that it’s just more of the same.
---
If they don't have a ring isn't that fair enough?
---
Wrong
---
Double no.
---
There is no way you sold one for more than 200-300 gold during vanilla.
---
Pretty sure you’re not sure. Caddyshack all the way!
---
If you are going to pvp then go lock. Tanks have no value in pvp in vanilla, Druids are just better at flag carrying. Dps warriors are gods with the right hit and gear. Locks I believe are a reliable 3rd/4th highest dps. Super boring in MC though do to dot limit (might be different in classic though)
---
Hi, /u/Best-of-Texas
---
Mage so you can sell portals whilst doing your crafting.
---
1. When people say slow, they mean it. I literally watch TV, movies, surf the web, talk to people on voice chat and phone.. etc. Personally I like that. I'm a huge movie fan and often raids these days are too complex to do both at once. Maybe on farm days, but still. 
---
2. Every class is fine. Just some going to be slower or expect you to play a certain role. So if you only want to dps, choose a pure dps class, tank choose warrior, healer is flexible but priest the safest probably.
---
3. Alliance, just like the races more. *Shrug
---
4. I like most of them, but Winterspring probably my fav. Ungoro probably next, dinos!
---
5. Right now, 8. Once we have a real release date, 10.
---
This kid is mad
---
that sounds vaguely familiar...  i forgot about selling keys and reserving loot as tank LOL
---
If it's a +INT ring for a warrior or a +STR for a priest, no it's not fair enough.
---
RIP every other aspect of your life.
---
every Alliance player in your guild can obtain Bag of Marbles. "Technically", you can make due with Wail of the Banshee but you'll probably need Scarab Brooch'ing healers just in case and a VERY optimal goup comp.
---
So....is this a real thing?  where do I go to use it?
---
Came here to ask the same question :D
---
Honesly suprised rised this was not explored as a game mechanic as it was the basis of wc3 to destroy enemy structures
---
Prostitution and Weed! ;)
---
Same thing with Mew in gen 1.
---
This is why I can't decide between joining a HC guild now or just running with the flow once classic is released.
---
PUGs make me want to play solo but HC elitism too ...
---
This is how you become a multiboxer I think :D
---
Have you played on a private server recently? You can use any resolution you want, and graphics look honestly pretty great considering it’s a game that came out so long ago. The only things that look iffy are low level pieces, because of less polygons, but they add to the classic feel because everyone looks funky until end game, then you see badass warlocks and shaman etc.
---
This is one of the main reasons why I’m excited for classic wow, since i never got to experience it when it was relevant (wrath baby here).
---
I’ll be extremely disappointed if they dont add this feature in.
---
I don't have stats for it, but reducing the fee to respec incentives people to actually respec and thus spec as much if not more gold on respecs because it's actually a viable option.
---
Get a really epic, highly sought-after name and use it for my bank alt.
---
For real though, I never have one with wow.  Once I stop having fun I'll say I beat the game and stop playing.
---
What class/race you playing?
---
Doing nothing for 30 minutes while trying to assemble a group via general and trade chat
---
NE Hunter all the way
---
Classic will be on patch 1.12, not 1.2.
---
&gt; Yeah no guild had naxx on farm
---
Maybe not in retail, but on private servers, most average guilds are capable of clearing it. With today's playerbase, it's nowhere near as hard as it used to be.
---
That was a typo, my mistake
---
&gt; Why continue when you already done it
---
BiS gear for PvP purposes. Completing T3 sets. etc.
---
As people have mentioned the spell power scaling of Flametongue is 10%, I have researched the viability a little, but I ran into a big unknown so personally I'm patiently waiting for release/beta to answer this question - Is the formula for flametongue 
---
(basedmg \* weaponspeed) + (spellpower \* .1)) 
---
or does it take weapon speed in account 
---
(basedmg + (spellpower \* .1)) \* weaponspeed.
---
For reference I've seen video that proves that paladins seal of righteousness spell power coefficient scales with weaponspeed meaning they get \~1 dps per 10 spellpower no mater their weapon speed.
---
If flametongue spellpower scales with weapon speed, shaman using flametongue, shock, and flame totem get \~2.3 dps per 10 spellpower before talents/crits/misses
---
to compare, mages frostbolt spam is 2.7 dps per 10 sp and warlocks shadowbolt spam is  2.8 dps per 10 sp before talents/crits/misses
---
so the spellpower scaling could be okay, not great, but ok.
---
Enhancement is one of the most fun specs in the game. While it may not be top tier, it still provides totem utility.  And as the comment above you was trying to allude to, there are always going to be people like you who want to min/max every single raid slot, when the boss is easily killed with a few meme-tier spots.
---
Try adding a temporary filter view following these steps
---
Loser Horde in STV
---
Atleast it doesn't have adds.
---
*Sharding intensifies*
---
That guy needs to feed his pet
---
I seriously don't think it's meant to be for people with dayjobs.
---
If I was unemployed without financial woes you can bet I would spend a week doing nothing but that with things like working out mixed in.
---
But come on.. no way in hell would I just no life on a small few week vacation only to have to go right back into 9-5. There's nothing to gain from it.
---
\+3 stam is better than +0 stam
---
I honestly think they should only give DKs to the person who kills the DK in a raid. Not in a party because that could lead to griefing, but I remember getting some DKs the same way that you mentioned while raiding astranaar.
---
Thanks, I'm retarded.
---
Feels like the Pokémon Chairman talking about his Rapidash.
---
Why? Were the idiots with Bathroom laws...
---
Thought my pc froze after clicking the link lol
---
Cant even deny it.
---
Also if you equip Corrupted Ashbringer, all/most of the NPCs in L!ght's Hope Chapel will be hostile to you, IIRC.
---
They might let it happen for a day for the meme.
---
I really hope they aren't going for the same date they release 1.12 originally for Classic release (August 22nd).
---
It’s 1.12 it’s launching already patched. Your post doesn’t make any sense.
---
Yeah if you want to PVP it’s easily warlock. As a warrior in Vanilla I found it frustrating to spec back and forth because honestly prot warriors are absolutely terrible at PVP and Arms warriors don’t tank at raids.
---
Main tanks go NE for dodge. Neither human nor dwarf
---
Oh God, I'm getting PTSD looking at this, lol
---
Heh it's all good. I wanted the filters by default but apparently that's beyond google sheets :(
---
Night Elf Hunter.
---
If you wait on a group without any melee to need on a melee weapon, you're probably going to wait for a looooong time before getting anything !
---
I'd probably say at the beginning of the dungeon what I would roll on.
---
If you're rich enough just get an arcanite reaper.
---
Making that kind of gold in vanilla is quite easy if you know what you're doing.
---
Farm as you're doing other things, choose your professions responsibly so that you make gold instead of spend it. Utilize the power of alts and their professions to maximize gold production. Lastly, use the AH... so many items are vendored that would easily fetch more on the AH, even if it's a 10s difference that money adds up over time.
---
All the lvl60 PVE I'll have to do for gearing up for PVP.
---
For the first year yeah pretty much.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Must be a PVE server. I don’t see the Vietnam choppers in the background.
---
För horden!
---
YALL LEAVE MY BABYMAMA ALONE!

Living Essence
---
Indeed. Rule 1 about race selection in Warcraft.
---
1. You're going to be see that ass for 60 levels and then some. Make it an ass worth looking at.
---
As for the various racials, none of them are absolute balance breakers. They will have very minor effects on your overall performance, so play whatever race you enjoy the most.
---
And some of you are wrong
---
How long the leveling takes. Don't get me wrong, the leveling is great and one of the best parts of vanilla, but I've done it dozens of times at this point, it's too long for me to enjoy it that much anymore haha.
---
That's one of the many reasons why I always went to IF. On my server before they patched it out he was ALWAYS kited to SW when he popped. You had to make sure to check general chat in SW every time you landed just in case he was "out on the town"
---
3. The enchanting trainer is in Uldaman.
---
Nothing can save Activision Blizzard. It’s doomed and so are all of it’s IPs.

"That's right because where would it end? People playing Ret and Boomkin!? Next thing you know there would be cash shops, flying mounts and LFR!" -Nochange people
---
So..... Complaining?
---
If you guys want to see a list of some basic essential addons I used for my warrior. Check it out: https://imgur.com/a/WsRgu3h
---
40 shards (drop about 30-40% of the time off Naxx bosses). So you’re talking like 100-130 boss kills (or fewer if you’re lucky). 
---
You also have to kill KT and C’Thun after getting 40 shards. So imagine having to raid that long for it then go back clear an instance people hated (AQ40).
---
I played in a Vanilla guild that got one it was legit for doing Kara in TBC though. Kid made a lot of gold opening Kara ports.
---
The lack of this is why theres so many lfr heroes. They never have to learn.
---
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. 
---
~~Mahatma Gandhi~~ Classic Wow Player
---
We're in phase 2, soon they will fight us !
---
People in the comments don't seem to be understanding your question mate..
---
Yes it's still really good for leveling even if you use up the charges because it gives 16 strength and 5 agility
---
If you get it at level 30 you will use it for a long time, probably until 45+
---
The only things I’m not looking forward to is the 1v1 moments that turn into 1v2. With a warrior whose just about to die then gets a Lay on Hands out of no where or when I miss and they crit me to half health. Other than that being the pain a keyboard smashing!
---
They even made the ashbringer light crystal in that scenario. Would have been an amazing hidden quest line.
---
My mistake was clicking the down arrows on B, C, D, etc, which only had sort by A-Z lol
---
Damn that takes guts. I recently quit my job but am going to try very hard to get employed before classic comes out, or else I'll never get a job
---
This is the real advice. You might end up wanting to level it further.
---
Can't wait to tell my friends 'hey they made your mom a raid boss' again
---
Just buy it 4HEad
---
It’s a prototype. Hopefully, it’ll come to fruition.
---
Zul Gurub wasn’t in 1.12, it wasn’t released until 1.7. How are they going to patch a bug for a raid that doesn’t exist?
---
Took me 91 runs on Druid to get my damn epic dagger, REEEeeee ;=;
---
I used to walljump on to those lampposts and watch him murder people. The aoe shadowbolt still hit me but I was a 60 holy pally so I could heal through that.
---
I honestly thought for a minute that the PvP rank system would be something everyone would collectively go, "ah yeah that thing needs changing" but wasn't surprised at all when they announced it was going to be the same. I felt that system was downright unhealthy when it came to climbing to the top, but nochange means nochange and I gotta respect that.
---
Full 18 slot bags
---
My favorite thing about this picture is how woefully under geared everyone is for the imposing doom!
---
I remember logging in to check my auctions in SW one day and someone had pulled Kazzak all the way from the blasted lands.
---
He was one shotting everything and the main square was a sea of skeletons.
---
If you don't want to raid, you could go with a paladin : if you're bored of healing you can tank (yeah not as good but still decent).
---
Ur right, but its a group of 5, and if someone else in the group needs it more it is kind of a dick move needing on it
---
Agree, it’s a lazy “solution” that kills some fun aspects of WPvP.
---
Just wait 1 phase and get barbarous blade from solo DM:N instead of wasting hundreds of gold on a fairly average weapon for hunters
---
Which is why the legion would send their literal space ships to the planet, that is the only reason they waited till legion to attack us, and even then give to reality one planet, divided as fuck on every possible front, being attacked by internals, dreadlords betraying out alliances, felhounds hunting our mages, I mean archimonde alone destroyed the kirin tor.
---
thought that was just a p server issue?
---
It's going to be a total fucking disaster, I'm very excited
---
Maybe undermine journal would have that kind of info but not sure how far in past you can view.
---
Why not go warrior and dps and sometimes tank aswell as sometimes pvp?
---
It makes the night elf wisp racial actually somewhat useful, since there are some long ass corpse runs out there
---
Same here
---
You could kite the fel reaper to shatt in tbc too. Seems dumb to not let people kite kazzak to stormwind.
---
I feel like you're going to hate A LOT of the people that play classic wow then
---
I think you are thinking the patch numbers are like this:  
---
1.7&gt;1.12  
---
When in reality its 1.0, 1.2, 1.3.....1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12.
---
I think what you are thinking is that its 1.2.1 (would be patch 1.2 with a minor patch)  and not 1 point twelve.    
---
x.= the version (in this case classic or vanilla)  
---
.1= the major patch number.
---
Kill KT at least once.
---
Get 1 of each class to level 60.
---
Blizz Plates - Anything to add CC effects and timers to enemy health bars.
---
Did ZG not exist is 1.12.1? Because that’s going to be the state of the entire game.
---
No such thing as a PvE realm. They're called normal realms because they don't use either of the PvP or RP alternate rulesets. It's like calling non-RP servers "OOC servers".
---
Good god NO. If you were to try to give a health stone to every raid member, there would be lots of people wanting to kill you. The darn things are "unique" so you can have only 1 in your inventory at any moment, so you'd be holding up the raid as you create a stone, open trade window, wait for trade partner to wake up and accept the damn thing, rinse, lather, repeat. Given a 3 second cast for the health stone, and assuming that the trade is EXTREMELY Fast, call it 6 seconds per raid member, for a total of 4 minutes. NO THANK YOU.
---
Warlock is one of the most fun classes. If you play horde, you’re an unstoppable PVP machine. On alliance, good warlocks will be more sought after, and they’re still pretty good for PVP, just worse than horde warlocks.
---
Plus, getting a tank spot in a raid is difficult, since you only take 1-2 main tanks, and a handful of available dps off tanks.
---
Dude you're my hero !
---
How do you post incorrect info so confidently
---
This big beautiful bitch has made me rich..
---
This is going to absolutely baffle people. I recently did the retail 1-20 leveling in eversong/ghostlands, and it blew me away how you have literally no downtime, just pull pull pull
---
&gt; Toxic people who still think that they're 13.
---
Gonna be a LOT of those imo
---
Maybe. I feel like there will be plenty of casuals to enjoy the game with.
---
Why kill her? She produces enough milk to feed all of alliance + horde. And as an added plus probably enough yeast in the crotch to make enough bread for everyone as well.
---
Warriors scale the most. They’re the worst when undergeared and arguably the best when overgeared. The way their rage mechanic works makes every piece of gear a noticeable improvement.
---

VERY optimal group has a warrior tank XD
---
This clownfest where 39 people gimp themselves so that a hunter can tank is anything but optimal
---
ZG was definitely in 1.12, literally everything added in vanilla was in 1.12.  They aren’t progressing patches just progressively unlocking content.  So when ZG unlocks it will be the 1.12 version.  Therefore the bug won’t exist.
---
&gt;I'm yet to be proven wrong.
---
Oh yeah, lemme get my peer reviewed study showing why your opinion about a video game is wrong /s
---
You are confused, and I understand why. Don't think of patch 1.12 as one-point-one-two. Think of it as one-point-twelve. 12 comes after 7. But I know why you are mixed up.
---
You're cute.
---
Yeah and -2000 player reputation is worse than no ring.
---
If you dont have stats why do you think this?
---
The VC fight will be interesting if you have to do it the legit way, not bugging the adds out on the canon.

It does a pretty damn good job at teaching you everything you need to know. You have to remember that the /played on average is 10 days in-game, so you’ll have invested 240 hours in before you ever hit max level. By then you’ll be fairly proficient at your class and can watch YouTube videos of how to complete boss fights.
---
Due to how long it takes, its actually quite linear and shallow. If you jumped in at level 60, youd definitely have a hard time.
---
But if you just pay attention and learn your abilities as you level, you could be an excellent player by level 60.
---
Your first dungeon will be between level 14-18, which means youll have about 15 active abilities to choose from and youll only use about 3 of them 95% of the time, so your first dungeon isnt something to really worry about. It certainly gets more complicated, but just adapt when you get new abilities.

Finkles Skinner from UBRS.

Tank weapon, I get it. Don't mind me, just trying to get it for skinning.
---
Yeah, I bet you got the one Dominos in the world that uses quality ingredients instead of what the franchise mandates.
---
Have you been to Desolace? There are quite a few quests there, both Horde and Alliance.
---
Back when I played (before x-realm bgs), there was an advantage playing as Horde with regards to queueing times for BGs, as there were a lot more people playing on Alliance.
---
Do you guys think this will be the case in Classic as well?
---
Heard a response yet?
---
I was in an amazing guild back in Vanilla, we had one simple rule. No Damage Meters, you could run one but dont talk about it, dont link it. After the Raid was over you could post and discuss all you wanted but as long as bosses went down nobody gave a shit who was top or who was bottom, it was a team effort and damage meters dont measure whos being the most useful.         
---
          
---
For instance if a cat form druid does half the DPS of a rouge, a 1/4 of the healing of a priest but innervates and brezzes, who is being more useful? The pure DPS rogue, the pure healing priest?           
---
            
---
Unfortunately I never have or ever will find a guild as amazing as my Vanilla guild...
---
streamers and their band of paypigs
---
We have absolutely no idea how long phase 1 will last, but I guess it won't be shorter than 3 or 4 months.
---
This is a long time to be without a decent melee weapon if you're playing on a PVP server.
---
Pally vs druid for world pvp? (specifically ret vs feral/hybrid) Especially during the leveling up process and at lower levels before max, which spec would you argue for and why? I'm deciding between the two and any information at all is helpful.
---
These will be definite necessities for me
---
All right I’ll look them up tonight after work. Thank you!
---
Nah, i don't need any more, but what if i just switch jobs, let's say my old company has to cut some positions and i go to a new one, i don't need any training.
---
Vacation time should be a basic right of a modern worker, it's not the first half of the 20th century anymore.
---
A probation time of like 3 months should be enough to evaluate the competence of the worker, in cases where the workers actions could have hard consequences (like a power plant worker or water system worker) then sure, extend it to 6 months, but a year seems too harsh.
---
I find that the overall lack of Druid representation in raids offsets the real rez limitation. Raids typically still want a battle rez unless they are basically into farm status. 
---
A limited amount of Druids are required but you won't see many competing for the spot anyway. Plus Druid gear will often drop and not having Druids in need of gear makes raid runs seems like a waste if it's a heavy Druid drop run.
---
Because of Loot trading? not really.
---
1. While colluding is something that can be done discreetly, bidding on an item then giving it away to someone is incredibly obvious.
---
2. You would still have to pay DKP to get the item and trade it away, meaning youre just losing all your DKP for someone elses sake.
---
i think they still have server types/names to announce
---
Should be pretty obvious there's collusion when Timmy doesn't wear the upgrade he won last week and Bobby has it. The people that do this will get caught fast. 
---
Colluding with other players of the same class to bid low on tier pieces and have more points on off-tier pieces is going to be a much bigger issue and isn't related to loot trading.
---
I'm setting the bar high for me. I'm a vanilla noob that left early Cata. Rolling gnome warrior and my beat the game moment is when I'm in full Naxx gear. I pray Blizzard doesn't rollout classic tbc before I get to 60 like last time. Never played on private servers. Currently don't even have a internet at my home and just finished building a low budget gaming PC. Also have a family this time around, so even less time to play. I'm switching factions for a 'fresh' feel. So yeah - the cards are stacked against me.
---
Yeah, although in mythologies, unions between supernatural beings were only sexual through symbolism. 
---
For example, I doubt even within the warcraft lore that Malorne, a stag and Elune, the moon somehow participated in physical penetration; more like joining of their respective aspects/essences to create something new. Was likely the same thing here and we're just filthy peons thinking dirty.
---
I think it took my friend somewhere between 5-8 weeks to collect all the shards. The most difficult part of the quest is to kill KT.
---
If it weren’t for that last line, I would say warrior. Since you’re not going to dps as warrior then Warlock for the better PvP.
---
Nobody cares that you ninja'd a ring at level 20. It has 0 consequences, and you gain +3 stam.
---
Addons?  I wish blizz disables addons completely so that everyone plays the same game and has the same ui experience.
---
What’s next, you will be asking for a tool that “queues me up for a dungeon, so I don’t have to find people my self”... 
---
Oh or maybe “the ability to transfer a look of one item onto another one”
---
It all starts with addons.  F addons, they just simplify the game.
---
i couldn't log into bfa's servers for the first 20 minutes while others could, but once i got in there were absolutely no problems
---
Is classic basically a choice between pve/pvp? I've been searching most of the day trying to find a way I'll be able to do both pve and pvp but due to debuff limits almost every class has to choose between one or the other.  Respeccing several times doesn't seem viable.  
---
If I talented for pvp would I have issues finding slots for dungeon clears etc? I don't really mind sacrificing raids for pvp but I'm not willing to straight up opt out of all pve content.
---
1. Cleared Ony, BWL and AQ40.. Not sure if I want to dabble with Naxx..
---
2. Playing the AH and get rich as a motherfucker
---
TIL I learned she was dead.
---
Auto loot (I don't see it on options of pserver)
---
Extended ignore list (gold sellers)
---
Gank list
---
I don't care if the person barely has any gear. Don't roll on stuff you can't actually use. Strength does nothing for casters. If a caster rolls on it then I just leave that run and put them on ignore. Not dealing with that stupid bs.
---
I consider this a bonus as you actually get to complete a zone before you level out. In fact you will probably have to do multiple zones after lvl 20 to keep a good supply yellow quests.  
---
Gold is never really a problem for skills unless you are buying materials for crafting and using the AH for more than the occasional gear upgrade. You will have the 40g for a first mount. The epic mount on the other hand is a grind.
---
I think warlocks have the biggest difference in performance between early raids and Naxx. They go from utility bots with curses that do subpar dps to threat monsters that can overtake the tank if they don't watch their aggro. 
---
Warriors, in comparison, are already top-tier in pre-raid BiS and stay at the top of the damage meters from start to finish.
---
Out of curiosity are you planning on getting another races mount asap??
---
That’s probably what happened yeah. My bad.
---
I LOVE this video. Thanks for sharing!
---
I seem to remember years ago during Vanilla (Feathermoon, US Roleplaying server) some Horde group kited this unkillable Tauren(? I think) ghost from Badlands (quest no longer in game) into Stormwind and like jackasses we all ran to try and kill it. You could get it all the way down to 1HP and it would not die. We literally lagged the server almost beyond capacity so the Mods had to do a server shutdown to purge it. Ah, back in the days of LagForge and LagWind (something I hope to God never returns, even if the "No Changes" crowd screams for it).   
---
And, just for shits'n giggles, I really think they ought to allow the Blood Plague out of ZG again, just so the CDC can have another live-excercise in epidemic containment.
---
Bliz has already said that content patches will be determined after they see how the players are progressing after release.
---
At best, we will only see a tentative schedule that wouldn't be confirmed until we are already playing the previous content patch.
---
I haven't played retail in years so I haven't seen them much before, why don't you like them? Is it mostly because of the silly/meme outfits?
---
It's all about timing to get those killing blows to activate spirit tap and even then it's a fucking nightmare
---
I mean, you'll be able to see if the wrong person is wearing the gear. DKP, EPGP, Loot council, doesn't matter, it's obvious.
---
oh sorry I should specify I mean 4 members also there's more too it than meets the eye. Its to much text to go into it here, but I'll gladly talk with you at a later date.
---
It's really messed up how we used to have chaotic fun times like that and now everyone's sealed away in their baby safespace dungeonfinder instances where everything is on rails. The game is like a theme park train ride now
---
I recovered my 12 year inactive account today. Found my TBC 70 Shaman. all the other things are gone or transfered to other accounts =/ the good chars that is. He stood there in his nice blue gear still tho the pretty Tauren :D
---
&gt; I wish blizz disables addons completely so that everyone plays the same game and has the same ui experience.   
---
I feel you, what about adding things like OMNICC or MOVE ANYTHING to the client? Those things are so vital.

Traveling was such a pain back then that a port to anywhere can be useful. It’s not a far trek to a flight path afterall. If your hearth is down and you’re not a mage then it’s quite useful. Dem 69 minute cooldowns....
---
Oh man that would definitely be a Screenshot moment.
---
Yeah but I'm hoping it won't be an addon. Not that I'm against them, but then my less tech-savvy friends and family won't have to worry about that.
---
Why is it a dick move if you don't have a ring. You both need it??
---
Fair call. In P1 without bgs I don’t expect world pvp to be super competitive that you need to drop cash on an arc reaper, but you do you. If you have the time and cash to feel it is justified, all power to you
---
I think the 3 months of world pvp are going to be amazing (well, unless you're trying to level in a popular zone). Like a genuine all out war
---
September sucks.
---
Damn I liked it.
---
It was just a rumour, during blizzcon when they were showing the classic panel they showed a gnome named osconty that was level 16, and another gnome in character creation called July... so people put them together to get July 16 (I'm pretty sure that's what happened anyone can feel free to correct me!).
---
You're confusing BiS with viable
---
https://youtu.be/US5DJAy-ASg
---
First off, you won't be training every level. Think every other level at most. If you want to save travel time, then set your hearthstone to Iron Forge and when you want to train, hearth to IF and then see if you can get a portal to Darnassus from a mage. But the availability of Paladin trainers is rather limited. Doing a quick google search indicates Iron Forge, Stormwind, and Theramore. And given the rather insane flight times between Theramore and Dark Shore, it would be faster to take the boat to Wetlands and fly to Iron Forge.
---
The absolute classic is rogues pressing need on the axe... because apparently rogues can use 1H axes in retail? I've had this happen to me 5+ times on private servers. One of these times I explained to our rogue that he couldn't even use it and he agreed with me, then it when it dropped he need rolled and said I was just lying to get it for myself.
---
Yeah, that could certainly be true, but I think it is a lot easier to imagine the "beautiful" princess and a half-deer guy getting dirty than a stag and the moon.

Np, updated!
---
ST is not the same now tho
---
Go play retail
---
Other than STV, Faldir's Cove in Arathi is good, Hillsbrad/Alterac should have a few quests even if you havent done the earlier leadins, Badlands Reagent Run from Thelsamar and a few Badlands quests should be good at that point. Sceptre of Light, Ghost-o-Plasm quest, Roll the Bones, Reagents for Reclaimers Inc. and Kodo Roundup quests in Desolace should still be good if you havent done them yet. A few Shimmering Flats quests should still be good.
---
Out of all those, Badlands has a lot of good leadins to the early 40s and is generally not too populated. Faldir's cove is pretty small, but its generally empty there. The Desolace quests are also fairly uncontested, but those quests are all fairly far apart from eachother. Shimmering Flats is risky, Ive had good times there and very bad times there as Alliance. Hillsbrad at that level is great for Alliance in terms of PvP, but the quests are mostly elite.
---
That is my point Stephen try to keep up

Hey! I made these wallpapers using Wallpaper Engine and I have them shared to Steam! Any feedback is appreciated and suggestions for what to do next are always welcome!
---
The collection link is: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1713590908 and I am trying to expand this album as quickly as I can muster with finals coming up! I try to make these pretty subtle to avoid clutter and take the attention away from the action on your PC, however these still have a lot to take in if you look around!
---
Enjoy!
---
Sweeping strikes whirlwind crits or execute
---
&gt; that is the only reason they waited till legion to attack us 
---
They attacked Azeroth numerous times before then.
---
&gt;and even then give to reality one planet
---
&gt; divided as fuck on every possible front, being attacked by internals, dreadlords betraying out alliances, felhounds hunting our mages, I mean archimonde alone destroyed the kirin tor.
---
Right. So not only is Azeroth able to defeat the Legion numerous times, they do it while fighting among themselves.
---
Should be updated now
---
The hardest part was to get a guild capable of farming Naxx.
---
Ya that's a rough spot in leveling. I usually found myself having to grab quests from various zones and finish previous quest chains. 
---
I'm not sure that I have any specific tips especially for Alliance which seems to have a dead area in those levels, partly enhanced by not having as many solid quest hubs as the Horde.
---
I just ensure that I didn't miss any of the long Alliance quest chains that take you into these levels and I tend to grind out a few levels during that time to earn gold for a lvl 40 mount. Those are the levels that Alliance find themselves traversing the entire world trying to pick up loose quests.
---
If you didn't blow all your SM quests early, you can try and fill the late 30's gap doing that dungeon repeatedly as most do anyway (class depending a little).
---
look at a leveling guide like [joanasworld.com](https://joanasworld.com) or something.  you go to STV several times and other maps in between.
---
Ehh, I wouldnt be sooo sure. 
---
Some turbo nerd gets his ring stolen, he may make it his mission to shit talk you in /2 all day and night. Since he is a turbo nerd he wont be quitting or logging out to go to work.

I actually love being objectively Machiavelli-evil in games, but I'd still go troll if faced with this choice. This might come off as obnoxious PC talk, but your character can be more than just a race.
---
My personal favorite image of trolls are the sneaky, headshrinkery, ritualistic voodoo type of evil that goes well with mages if you change your perspective on the class in a similar way.
---
A troll character wouldn't necessarily be a learned arcanist in this case, but he could definitely be a pyromancer. 
---
Look for fanart on race/class combos for inspiration!
---
Holy shit you are bored.
---
These are sick.  
---
Request Gnome with spinning gadget looking thing.  :)
---
Does EPGP solve this collusion problem (ie everyone bidding low) by having fixed prices for gear which affects your PR right?
---
Rune of the Guard Captain was added in patch 1.5. It might or might not be in the game at the start.
---
For alliance side (and if Rune isn't in the game at the start), your next best trinket is Shard of Afrasa, which gives 5 hp5 and 5 mp5. 5 fucking mp5.
---
*5 mp5* versus 20 AP. It's a no-brainer. You are completely wrong.
---
Yeah, makes sense. 
---
Any idea how balance Druid scales with AQ+ gear for pvp?
---
I’ve seen people mention that balance becomes better than HotW after AQ.
---
You gaining 30 health vs the warrior gaining 30 health + 14 attack power.
---
I noticed you continuously use two adjectives each time, and italicized. What's up with that?
---
PUG and add the coolest folks to your friends list. You’ll create an informal guild in no time.
---
To be fair, warriors can tank most non-raid content in fury spec provided they gear for it.
---
I'm just jealous people have more time to spend on WoW than me.
---
I want to progress and beat AQ40 + Naxx. Didn't get the chance to in Vanilla.
---
Or the paladin version
---
&gt; I'ma read the sub during flight!
---
honestly yeah i would be really into this. add a bunch of content, sure, as long as its *content* and not QoL crap from retail
---
Rest XP at low levels is pretty much worthless, given how little time it takes to make levels at low level. So sure, roll a warrior and let it max out its rest. Might save you 5 to 10 minutes total.
---
As somebody who played Rust for the past 5 years... I can understand why somebody might want to play PvE. It's very peaceful.
---
Rust, and to a much lesser extent games like PUBG can be very stressful and it's nice to have a game that you can fall back into with leisure. 
---
With that said, I'm personally going to  be duo-boxing a rogue+druid and going to gank every person I see in STV while leveling up.
---
There is basically no gear from leveling 5 mans that you NEED (exception being warriors needs a new wep every 10 or so levels). Doesn't make me any less enraged when my gear is stolen or feeling compelled to rerun leveling dungeons so i can have the ideal gear for me level--but I take solace in knowing im not truly prevented from progressing without it. 
---
Now a shaman takes my draconian deflector and imma strangle a motherfucker.
---
What makes a horde warlock better than an ally warlock?
---
And sacrifice valuable masturbation time? For shame.
---
Telling me people on private servers are clearing naxx is like telling me people in Wotlk cleared naxx.
---
Id really love to know as well
---
I remember farming for the Crusader Weapon Enchant Plans on all of my characters to sell on the AH and running solo BRD runs for Robe of the Archmage tailoring plans for my mage and then farming for all the mats to make it.
---
It wasn't as satisfying as the expectation you had of the satisfaction of your first epic drop.  Then you got Lifestone, and after that you know you'd rather have the mass quest completions.
---
It was halved  on a pserver and I went from not respeccing to respec twice a week because it became worth it to do so.
---
If you're taking the professions to make money, then take 2 gathering professions. Skinning is a definite and then either mining or herbalism (don't want 'em both because they conflict with tracking on the mini-map).

Screenshotted this reply. Blows my mind how some people in the USA can be so brainwashed to be legit terrified of socialized medicine.  The meira thought of helping someone else out who doesnt put In "their fair share" sends them off the walls.

---
Also, "I need the money". I've actually had people use this excuse when called out for needing on everything.

Whats the difference?

Don't get the retailers started. They'll scream and say OOOOH NO YOU SAID NO CHANGES!!!!
---
I'm not familiar with EPGP. I think the colluding would only be present if there is blind bidding. If there are minimum/fixed prices for items, then that should definitely reduce/eliminate the collusion issue.
---
that's an interesting thought. I hadn't even thought of the impact that they could have. What do you think could happen?
---
Crafted arrows? What game have you been playing?
---
Engineering allows you to craft ammo for guns, but you can't make arrows. when you get near 60, there is a repeatable quest you can take that allows you to trade a stack of thorium shells for a stack of thorium headed arrows, but that's the closest engineering gets to crafting arrows.
---
I love my Warlock
---
100g is the mount price. 40 is the level. :)
---
You really NEED a 7 strength ring as a mage or priest? And before you say anything about the stamina, you can get a simple 3 stamina ring really easy from somewhere else.
---
Sure, this would matter in a guild run with loot council. In reality you have +30 hp instead of +0 hp. 
---
I like how everyone jerks the magical vanilla community until things like this come up. This will happen all the time, and it happened even more 15 years ago.
---
lol that was dumb.  you can farm as ruin or DS you didn't have to switch...lmao!

That's where you're wrong, boy!

If the trolls summoned Sargeras his scalp would be hanging in Zul's basement to dry and Gorshalach would decorate a pyramid somewhere.

I have fond memories of vanilla and I probably never played more of WoW than during this time (WotLK being a close second), but there are definitely some that I'm dreading:
---
-Lack of dual specialization/spec swapping: I generally DPS but I'm more than willing to tank when necessary, for how hard vanilla pushed hybrid classes they really do make it hard to play one
---
-Carrying pets/mounts in your inventory: I've played a lot of F2P games and I frankly hate battling inventory space (shout out to ammo bags)
---
-Weapon skills: it made getting new weapon upgrades bittersweet depending on the class, I did most of my skilling when people kited those invulnerable Blasted Lands mobs to Stormwind
---
If you hate carrying mounts/pets in your bags then warlock is the class for you!
---
Nice!
---
Thanks! If you come up with any other titbits of information, please share. You’ve convinced me, but I know some will be wanting to see the data. I encourage you to do some variance analysis to the other races, maybe record a trek across the Barrens and then study the logs? I know they’re better, but I want to be able to quantify how much better.
---
Let me know if I can help.
---
Hmm, that post didn’t last long.
---
First thing I thought of haha
---
If I recall, originally mobs would be chasing you for much longer times. This enabled lots of griefing. Not just this one guy. It was intentional, I believe. They didn’t expect the griefing to be a problem, I guess.
---
This was changed for all mobs. But occasionally, just through quirks of programming, a boss can be kited unintentionally still.
---
They’re referring to most horde being undead which has WOTF racial to get out of fear. However, it’s really not as big of a deal as people make it out to be.
---
They are probably gonna change up the API, Legion had some nasty API capabilities, just look up ERT for Archimonde, it made the fight MASSIVELY easier
---
*Fortunate son intensifies*
---
Odd, vanilla was pretty alt unfriendly and since most classes change substantially at 60 (like Warriors) I'm kinda surprised there are still altoholics
---
Hahaha thank you for this
---
Yes.
---
*(this is a very rough example of what happened, not exactly accurate)*:
---
In 2004 it was Jeff, Mike, Kevin, Alan, Rob, George, and John sitting around the table during the design meetings. 
---
In 2010 just Rob and Kevin remained and all the new guys weren't really listening to them. 
---
In 2012 none of the original guys were sitting around that table making design decisions. 
---
These things always come down to the sensibilities of the people involved and THAT stems from the sensibilities of management. If upper management was not actively hiring people like those 2004 guys then you get retail.
---
Not going to touch addons.
---
Oh no...is Classic releasing with the original GY system?  Some of those are fucking ridiculously far, like halfway across the zone.
---
It's also relative to how old a server is.  I was playing on a private server last month just dinking around and at level 25 I had like 40g already because a lot of low level herbs were selling for decent prices.  
---
When vanilla hits won't be many people buying swiftthistle or grave moss for 5g/stack in week 1.  Grinding that gold on a new server is a little bit harder.
---
I do know that, obviously you get the point of my statement.
---
WoD launch was fine but the servers were a mess and had queues on practically every server for a good week afterwards. Legion launch was super smooth though no major issues, BFA was pretty good as well apart from a few of the bigger servers crashing about an hour in. I think as long as people spread out across the servers in Classic and don't
---
want my damn bluepost so I can get those very flintrock shoulders
---
&gt;suggest addons that existed in vanilla
---
&gt;have only played vanilla
---
&gt;Reddit tells me to go play retail
---
Lel
---
god damn, thats awesome. Honestly, i'd be ok if DHKs never existed. if enough horde get together to kill an entire town and take it over, then i say they earned the right to camp the city for as long as they want.. just make NPC respawns shorter. thats all you have to do to stop the griefing really
---
&gt;Trying to coordinate 40 people's schedules
---
Wow, I think you just killed my desire to play Classic with this one reminder.
---
No DKs was a part of vanilla, so having no DKs is also classified as "no changes".
---
I wonder what they'll sell for in Classic, on pservers they're basically worthless. I bought a crimson whelpling on ND for less than 3g.
---
AFAIK, there was a big project like this for retail a while ago, but it got shut down by blizz, it had actual people doing the reading, not some software.
---
But they got shut down cuz they changed some quest texts tho, i am not sure.
---
TBH I liked some QoL changes. Specifically stacking Soul Shards. I always felt locks had to unfairly deal with less bag space compared to hunters since they at least got some free ranged attack speed. Fuck rogues.
---
absolute unit
---
They are waiting because they are hoping to drop Classic and 8.2 a week or ahead  of FF14s expansion launching they aren’t sure if 8.2 will be ready yet though.
---
That will give them a huge bump in subs/revenue in what is normally the quietest quarter of a pretty dismal year for them company as well as undermining their chief competitor in the biggest ways they possibly could. New patch for live for people in to that, classic to appeal to the large number of players who have bailed on WoW for other games over the years. 
---
Once the 8.2 PTR is up and not a burning pile of crap expect the see a Classic release date announcement. If it gets to the end of May beginning of June and 8.2 is still testing, they’ll drop a date. Probably the last couple of weeks of June.
---
The July 16th date I suspect is a red herring unless they are planning to drop 8.2 the July 2nd and then follow up with Classic a couple of weeks later.
---
You don't get portals till level 40 afaik
---
I take Enchanting on pretty much every character I've ever made and I don't think I can go back to a pre-Vellum system
---
If you're level 20 with 48 hours played ,it's your first time playing wow. Assuming the launch conditions are decent.
---
Hard to say. They might have had one or more Atiesh on that server. No way to verify that one and a half decade later.
---
&gt;I basically won't bother getting pets because they take up inventory I won't bother collecting multiple mounts for the same reason.
---
It also feels really redundant when you've likely already gotten them all on your retail account as well
---
**THIS**
---
He he he....
---
Yep, for some reason the muppets here don't realize that having no DKs is also classified as "no changes". They are using 1.12 as a base. BASE. They are free to change whatever was, and was not in vanilla, and it would still be "no changes". 15 man UBRS - same logic, if they go for that it's also "no changes".
---
DKs was a completely retarded thing, which discouraged world PvP. The magic of vanilla was huge town/city raids.
---
Rogue is rather nasty to level. It's great against 1, maybe 2 targets. But if you get any adds as a rogue, you're gonna have to Vanish and hope you didn't have any DoTs ticking, or you're gonna be making a corpse run. I think that he has the rogues properly placed.
---
This data alone s a bit much for me to handle... :D
---
I mean there was a period of time in vanilla where the honor system existed &amp; dhk did not, so maybe an option would be to not include dhk until phase 3?
---
You're absolutely delusional if you think pserver naxx is the same difficulty as WOTLK naxx.
---
Unviable specs
---
Griefers
---
No aoe loot
---
Bugs they wont fix cause jts part of the experience
---
Who's gonna listen to him? If you are a good player nobody is gonna care what some kid says you did at level 20, and this goes double if you are heal/tank.
---
DHK’s
---
not having guild banks in at launch was a massive oversight. Especially with all the crafting materials you gather from raids
---
She had an epic drop right
---
That's just how people are, I love getting lectured by people who probably only got as far as BWL (I raided Naxx for comparison) about the viability of certain specs for raiding.
---
Some specs like Prot Paladins just weren't viable for progression raiding.  There are *glaring* holes in their kits
---
Yes, that makes sense. Every mind has it's own subjectivity which can lead both ways. When Activision took over, the passion for the good part of the game became more and more absent..
---
I got my wife a hitachi
---
Sunken Temple is my favorite. Im gonna heal that shit for weeks straight.
---
For the record I still remember the name of the player that ninjaed the blue 2 handed mace from Deadmines (he was a rogue).
---
Voleurman if you read this I will find you !!!  :p
---
No it doesn't serve a purpose.
---
It discourages world PvP, which was a huge part of vanilla, why shouldn't there be huge town/city raids? Why should people whining about their quest giver being killed, be given priority over actually having WAR in World of WARcraft?
---
"Hey, Warrior/Tank (and to a lesser extent: Pala/Rogue/Shaman/Druid), do you need?"
---
If yes -&gt; Press greed
---
If no -&gt; Press need
---
Who knows, im just putting up hypotheticals
---
Would be awesome.  Actually struggling to decide what I want to play when Classic launches between Druid and Rogue.  Will definitely try this out if I go Druid.
---
it's interesting because I absolutely hated cross realm BG's and it was  the start of the snowball that killed wow for me.
---
We had such great rivalries on my server and quick queue times so there was no benefit for us, just downsides. 
---
From that day forward everyone was just a nameless faceless player that might as well have been an NPC
---
oh lawd she comin'... ok wait she stopped for a breath...
---
You’re right. I was so preoccupied with if we could, I never stopped to ask if we should.
---
Oh god wailing caverns
---
I'm gonna do it, I dont like traveling and consider this a vacation.
---
That sounds like a great loot system. This is very similar to how my old vanilla guild did things.
---
Lights Hope is probably your best bet, just search up the name, you will find it quickly.
---
Note that the items from CThun and KT were quest items, not rare drops like for TF

Easiest in my opinion is hunter, followed by warlock. But assuming that your GF wants to play while you play, it may be best for her to go night elf druid. Still very easy to solo, and offers a variety of options while in a group to keep it interesting. As for Mage or Priest, I feel that Mage is harder to solo when needed. It takes a fair amount of skill to kite and kill large groups of mobs. A priest can solo fairly easily and if she's willing to take on a healing role, is in high demand for groups.
---
Don’t hate the player, hate the game
---
My guild had an addon in wrath that did this. Since we almost certainly aren't getting the old 1.12 API but instead Legion/BFA API, I would be surprised if there isn't an addon that does this.
---
Agreed.
---
I honestly wish that all of the Vanilla bosses were retuned, new threats, new damage, new spells, etc.
---
Some of the best times were when the GM's took over super-elites in beta and just ROAMED the game.  It was spontaneous, it was fun, it was hysterical -- and it made us love the game even more.
---
Back in release, when the TM/SS battles would occur, many of us would hold our quest for Hecular until a heavy battle was ongoing.  Back then, he was quite an elite and could wipe out the entire town.
---
We would sneak down, finish the quest, and simply DIE in a great viewing place to watch him just wipe out all of the pvp'ers and the NPC's.
---
Then Blizz nurfed him, and now he dies in 4 shots.  :(
---
Not at the moment. Maybe someone will do it in future.
---
A lot of the people in this sub will be complaining too. Just based on the comments in this post alone there are a lot of people who just don't like Classic WoW.
---
Holy crap that was long. Good read.
---
I stopped playing just short of Wotlk and could tell the game was no longer the same game that I had once played.
---
This article does a really good job at describing the QoL changes that eventually eroded the communities of every server.
---
ProbAbly means 24 hrs played over 2 days.
---
This has not worked in 14  years
---
Even deadmines was a challenge for some folks to get through
---
Loot trading will only be in dungeons. DKP will probably only see usage in raids. So your idea wouldn’t be able to work in raids to begin with.
---
I think I'll just reserve things if I run as a healer or tank. As the warrior tank, I'd just say, "I'm running this solely to obtain the Silverlaine ring. Any objections?" If the cat druid claims they also will be wanting to roll on it, just mention as politely but firmly as possible that it's a deal-breaker for your participation.   
---
If not, and it's a warlock, mage, priest, and a rogue (who already has it or otherwise states they won't 'need' roll it), then you're set.   
---
I played vanilla through W.o.t.L.K., and so I learned the hard way that this is occasionally necessary.   
---
Now, if you're a mage (like my main will be) and I try reserving any of the Arugal cloth or the Feline Mantle shoulders, the priest and warlock and going to say "lolk" and kick me from the party, because D.p.S. is a dime a dozen.
---
Once I'm done with my pvp grind to rank 12, I can't wait to farm quest giving NPC's until I'm unranked.
---
They don't do anything to stop people who aren't looking to actively rank which will be camping battlemasters in their own cities anyway.  They are a failure of design and there is a reason they were one of the first features pulled from the game for TBC.
---
If Blizzard wanted to protect them from accidental kills or griefing, they should be actually punishing to kill by summoning elite guards when killed or make them immune to aoe spells unless directly attacked.
---
They didn't even exist within the whole breadth of the pvp system anyway, so them not being including in classic would still fall under "no changes".
---
If you think not having Battle groups in Classic is fine, then you need to also consider not including DHK's. You can't cherry pick to not have one vanilla feature and shut down not including another.
---
I started in 1.9 and I definitely Kazzak destroying SW once.
---
and sharding.  and so much more.
---
When you're leveling and doing dungeons, you generally are happy to get a healer and tank as soon as possible. People aren't going to be that picky.
---
If you end up with two healers, then one can DPS and off-heal when shit goes south.
---
I remember early on in vanilla you could start casting Arcane Missiles on a target close to you, then switch targets to anything you could see and it would start casting on them. Had a good time on a mountain in Blasted Lands dueling my mage buddy and sniping people halfway across the zone. Quite satisfying, haha.
---
༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ Gib Orange Post ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ
---
I remember that if the healer wasn't fast on dispels you could wipe really fast to the guys who cast hex. And runners could pull in extra packs a lot of the time.
---
I play on nethergarde right now and there's usually around 1k-1500 players concurrent
---
ITT it comes down to the degree of need and that the polite thing to do would be give the item to whoever gets the most benefit from it.  Personally I don't roll on an item if I can't make use of all the base stats and I know there's someone in the group that could.
---
I plan on raiding SS. But then I can go back to not worrying about some fuck gankimg me when I go afk because my kid smacked his face on the door or the other one wants a pbnj.
---
The hunter has 3 minutes left on Might, I think he can take him....
---
I don't remember if those are the guys that throw the totem down (so DPS can just kill the totem or healer dispel) or not
---
Not allowed to name private servers here.  Go to the wowservers sub instead.
---
Word of warning - that sub is the absolute biggest cesspool on reddit and asking for advice on a server is going to lead to a bunch of ‘competing’ playerbases hyping their own server while hurling a slew of insults at anybody that plays on and/or recommends a different server.
---
Its the opposite.
---
What quest does that begin? Did only that one guy get to do this quest?
---
It did. But unfortunately my friends all have families and busy lives now and won't be returning to classic
---
It never hurts to open a ticket! If you are able to give some substantial dates and data points showing when your account was compromised it would probably help restore it to a point in time. But if there's obvious history of sharing it's going to be a lot harder to nail down unless someone changed your email right before it all went down.
---
That and a backup from a few months ago is more likely than a backup from a few (or 10) years ago to get restored. I doubt blizzard has that much history and capability but again, the worst they say is no.
---
Those last 20 levels are tough! And will be crazy painful on PvP servers during phase 2... try to not be level 48-59 when phase 2 starts.
---
Bloodsail and furbolgs?
---
Hi, /u/Forex4x
---
&gt; You raid as a group/guild, not as an individual. 
---
Yeah, and Atiesh is not something a guild needs. If you have Naxx on farm you have essentially beaten the game as a normal raiding guild.
---
Don't get me wrong.  I am very excited for world PVP again!
---
But not having the option of WSG, AB, or AV for another 8-10 months after launch is no bueno.
---
I did. It's definitely playble but it's not BfA kind quality. Graphics is not a deal breaker for me anyway. I'm very much excited for classic the way it is:)
---
Paying to respec.
---
Dual-speccing was the best thing about TBC (it was TBC, right?). All the rest of it they can leave on the table.
---
Seems pretty easy, right?
---
But nah, fuck it ill just go with the good ole’ ”i thought i presseded greed xD”
---
Isn’t E3 in June? Doesn’t Activision usually have a big event?
---
They could go with the industry trend of making an announcement that Classic is releasing “today and is available right now.” They could ride the wave of gaming news.
---
I think it’s going to be MUCH larger than Blizzard is expecting.
---
All current Retail players ~3 mil checking it out. Past players that didn’t play Vanilla ever ~1 mil. Veterans of vanilla that stopped playing ~ 2 mil. People who have never played WoW ~ 1 mil.
---
This on top of EVERY streamer on Twitch returning is going to make so many kids who honestly don’t have a clue about the game get a trial and play.
---
By the end of launch, we could seriously be sitting at 15-20 million people playing.....
---
Any computer that can run Fortnite these days will easily handle WoW Classic. Ontop of the hype from all the old players....
---
I was amazing when there were still unknowns out there.
---
People like you are almost always try-hard shitters. Only care about min-maxing and rage hard when their pre-computed (not even computed by them of course) get outplayed by a “meme” spec. 
---
I’m yet to be proven wrong.
---
And high level alchemy is in Scholomance, Dark Iron smelting and Forging in BRD, etc. Lots of professions in Vanilla have the high level crafting hiding in some instance or other, enchanting isn't an exception.
---
wowclassicbis.com
---
That's the spec I used for pvp mostly. It's an easier build to get into for pvp if you begin leveling as feral but have no real interest in continuing being dedicated to feral for raiding.
---
Once you start collecting pre-BIS healing gear, you can mix in some Int, healing and perhaps a little spell damage gear to build an early ghetto hybrid set. Because this gear still sucks for a pure caster, it works better as a feral/heal hybrid as you do not have enough spell damage to boost your best coefficient spells into usefulness. 
---
Any real damage you do in feral requires a dedicated build for shred or at least physical damage. You won't have much Int and nearly no spell damage/healing. True hybrid sets for Druids do not really exist in the game early on. HotW is the easier transition from feral into a better overall pvp build than pure dps feral.
---
Hotw changes the feral play style into a hybrid caster using spell dots and bleeds. Actually a lot of players do not realize how much damage it does through dots. You'll be popping into and out of melee range like mad and basically are just trying to get all your dots off and add in any damage you can through forms. You will kite and mix in ranged and melee damage.
---
It's strengths are in open world play and small teams. The better your hybrid set is, the more you can use your damage spells and heals so it's also a support build for group pvp. You damage, kite, cc, off heal ... the whole works.
---
Basically though, it's the easier hybrid build to transition to from feral to healer. Another great pvp build is 29/11/11 but I wouldn't ever consider it until I had a true hybrid gear set with a decent amount of spell damage.
---
Magmaw? In Blackwing descent?
---
If that's the fight you're talking about I agree.
---
I main tanked that for our guild. Loved that fight for some reason.
---
One of my favorite bosses since TBC.
---
Hell yeah, go from 125% to 150% speed while dead
---
Hell no, if something has an assload of str like that you do not roll on it as a mage.  Unless it’s one of those weird items that have equalish parts int and str and you’re rolling against a warrior.
---
Of course people will do this and there really isn’t much you can do about it, but it’s still a dick move.
---
the dominos in my area used to suck but in the past few years its actually gotten really good
---
Very nice. This should have a lot more upvotes!
---
31/5/15 allowed for a lot of flexibility. SOOOO many warriors used that spec.
---
\4. Reddit formatting
---
good meme vs. subjective mod
---
How's that one mind-controlled-draenei boss in throne of tides this time around? There's been weeks where I healed timewalking &amp; his cone hit for 60% of the tanks HP, with another 30% or so per second. Heaven forbid if the cone isn't aimed properly. The scaling has always been hit-or-miss
---
Personally I feel like the no change and pserver community are the ones who will complain far more than anyone else. At least from what I’ve seen on this sub, they’re the ones who never seem to be happy.
---
Gotta love playing 15-18 hours a day for months only to get the flu when you're rank 12 and be stuck in bed for a week or two.
---
It does hurt a bit. You basically need to wear 2-3% more hit from gear to almost have the same threat output as a human. Ots harder to get your hands on good swprds and maces since humans in your guild use them better. On the contrary, you can go for less contested weapons pretty easily like daggers and axes. But if your in a guild with dwarf tank, probably lots of people wont be the optimal race so maybe you will be able to get swords/axes.
---
But look at some tank gear setups and check out the pain it is to wear 3 % more hit. Humans just wear Lionheart, 2 hit rings, satyrs bow and ony neck. Dwarf has to like find hit gear from raid gear that dps want generally. Even when you match the human's hit, you still dont get the glancing blow benefit from weap skill which is significant. Its kinda stupid how good that racial is.
---
Like others said, you will be fine as dwarf. Bit I thought I would provide a realistic view of what its like.
---
Dmd
---
Two big things that I'm worried about. So worried that I am concerned it will ruin the 'classic experience'.
---
1. Modern tools used in classic to determine how 'good' a player is.
---
2. People assuming some classes/specs are not viable and therefore not welcome.
---
Both of these are related and I'm not looking forward to them. I would hate to see some kind of rader.io made for classic which will instantly exclude people from parties. To be fair, I don't think it would be as detrimental in classic as it is in modern. For the most part if you have the gear all you can really judge somebody on is if they have done the dungeon, not the 'speed' which they did it like in modern. So might not be a huge deal.
---
The second point is one of those things that is so common in modern that I can see it happening in classic especially because of how imbalanced classic is. Modern example is that people would not bring a DPS shaman in 8.0 because they were so trash. So every time a dps shaman signed up in my que I took them. Low-n-behold they would almost always top dps. The kind of person who stuck around to play a 'trash class' happened to be the kind of person who excelled at that class. I'm worried about raids that have 12 rouges and 12 warriors because other classes 'just don't do enough dps' because in classic there is a lot more than dps to consider.
---
And you can level your professions from 225-300. It's the sweet spot for gold.
---
You still end up being ahead of everyone else. Also, if you're NOT taking time off in anticipation of servers being shitty you're going to look so dumb if they work fine AND you'll be way behind to boot.
---
To be completely honest, it's the old pixellated textures. I didn't like the graphics in vanilla, either, though. I don't think they've aged poorly, I've just never been wild about soupy, blurry, pixellated, low-res textures. But this isn't a big deal, it's just the first thing that comes to mind that I'm not enthusiastic about, and ReShade makes up for it with the various fun effects it adds.
---
After dabbling on a pserver (2 toons to 30) I didn't encounter anything I'm not really looking forward to.
---
I could say 1.12. AV, but I've always enjoyed AV, even as of WoD when I unsubbed I still thoroughly enjoyed AV. While I'd prefer an older version of it, I've liked every version of it just fine.
---
"I know you're relatively new and have some things you could improve on, but if we're not absolutely destroying this instance then you suck and should get good in the next 20 seconds or you're out... No, I'm aware you're doing this to gear up... Just gtfo, n00b"
---
It's a shame Tauren is the least played race for Hunter. I think they look so cool. Plus it's totally a part of their lore right from the the first quests (being hunters).
---
I'm pretty sure it's a spell that can be dispelled. But a lot of healers aren't fast enough.
---
Whether it’s bis or not really doesn’t make a difference. You should know what classes the item is good for and how valuable it is for each and who needs the upgrade the most. Whether it’s technically bis or not is irrelevant.
---
Do you have this picture in non-stretched form? Geez how did that even happen and why did you post it like that
---
It legit took me over a week until I was able to log into WoD in a timely fashion. HOURS long queue every time I wanted to play. It actually killed my drive to play that expansion. I had the same experience with Legion where it was basically perfect right off the bat.
---
I’m bracing myself for classic raider.io scores somehow.
---
Username checks out
---
I didn't even think about the madness of World Boss kills! For sure a bucket list item for me as well. You plan on leveling you shaman as elem all the way to 60 or do you just mean level it to 60 so you can elem pvp at 60?
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Uh, no. They defeated agents of the legion and portals. Not THE LEGION. Azeroth is one planet, the legion has thousands fueling their wars. What are you missing about they are a literal unending legion that only lost due to plot armor?
---
I think you put the wrong word in quotes here
---
I hope the devs have some fun in Classic. Have Chrome come into IF the first week and say there was so error in the time combobulator and it accidentally spawned 10 core hounds. They have the opportunity to do fun/silly things again, and I hope they take advantage of it.
---
The fact that some specs just literally aren't viable for raiding and that it will never be fixed.
---
A great example is how Elemental Shaman has no "reduce enemy resistance to nature/fire/frost" talent like all other casters.  It completely invalidates raiding as Elemental if you are serious about it.
---
Gotta max out one-handed sword skills
---
Hard core. Hope you get it!!
---
Shhhhhh the servers will crash with a large female dwarf pop
---

In any particular fashion? 😂
---
Do you have any versions that don't have the game logo?
---
You can’t afford to be super mom max-ey when you have 40 spots to fill instead of 25
---
Yeah but not everyone of the 40 people in the raid will know, and if they can easily check via an add-on, then the loot distribution decision is transparent and less open for conflict.

Repost
---
I get why people don't like m+, but I don't really get your arguments to be honest? 
---
&gt;never ending difficulty tiers isn't content
---
1. It's not never-ending, there are limits to what is possible. The absolute top tier in the m+ community are pushing the limits, but there is kind of hard-caps for what is possible to do. 
---
2. Why isn't it content? I get that you might not like the kind of game where you replay levels on harder and harder difficulties. But it definitely is "content" for people that like that type of game. 
---
&gt;nor is it the form of difficulty I want
---
What do you want? (not trying to provoke you here, genuinely curious as to what other type of difficulty you are thinking of)
---
&gt;and it only works in the completely broken gearing system WoW has had in the last two expansion
---
Again, why? At least for higher keys people are more or less reached a sort of gear cap at this point, and it's only improvement in strategies/execution that makes them able to push higher keys. 
---
&gt;This was Diablo brought to WoW
---
Never more than played through diablo 2 tbh, maybe I should give the third one a chance. 
---
&gt;and it's one of the many issues with the current incarnation of WoW.
---
What do you want? Easy dungeons like in vanilla? Where the only somewhat engaging thing you could do with them after gearing up is speedrunning the same easy thing trying to improve clear times? You could even do that in BfA if you wanted tbh, just run +10s, it's pretty similar difficulty-wise.
---
Downvoted for the /s tag, as always. Especially in satire subs like this, sarcasm is basically the majority of comments, yet the threads aren't full of /s tags cascading down all of them.

Fuck off with your stupid little shitty /s tags, they ruin reddit. They are cancer, they are absolute shit. Every single time that I see a /s tag my eyebrow twitches with fury. Don't you fucking dare use stupid /s tags because they are literally terrible and I do not approve of them at all.

Ah, what's your plan for Classic. You gonna level to 60, go in and kill Baron RIvendare once, then never do UD Strat ever again? I mean, why you you want to kill a boss more than once?
---
Yeah but just go 20/0/31. Spam FoL/Cleanse in raids two nights a week. Then wreck in pvp all day long.
---
Hey OP,
---
I'll b rolling a fem dwarf warrior, my personal justification to this was that the human weapon skill and glancing blows did not effect yellow attacks. 
---
So heroic strike, revenge, shield slam etc do the same threat and because you are MT you gen more threat which means more yellows and less white.
---
Frost resist and stone form are arguably defensive abilities for raids.
---
However.. humans could probably pull off fury/prot combo well woth flurry for max tps. 
---
Im not sure how much tps comes from white dmg as opposed to threat gen yellows but then again you could always toss maladath or any weapon with +skill in your mh.
---
Play dwarf ;)
---
Ps if you wanna fury, you get can throw on edgemaster handguards and mala. The expertise caps or diminishes around 10/15 apparently. 
---
We good!
---
Man even if your 60 it’s a bad time lol
---
I don't know tbh, can't be bothered by that shit now, don't have any alt that needs gear. I did tank a few last time there was cata timewalking, with my warrior alt, and I don't remember throne of tides being a problem for the tank at least. I remember a bunch of dps leaving over and over again on the last boss in the air dungeon because they couldn't do it, despite me telling them what to do.

Priest is pretty easy since there’s almost no downtime between pulls and you can just heal yourself as you go. A bit boring but quite efficient.
---
I don’t think there is a quest connected with it.  Wowhead shows some quest about getting water.  I think at some point in development it was going to be a part of the Thunderfury quest, but then they changed things and forgot to remove the neck from the loot table.  It dropped once and then was removed from the loot table, and Blizzard decided to let the guy keep it. https://wow.gamepedia.com/Talisman_of_Binding_Shard shows the original stats and some background on the item.

It has to do with time zones and the gravitational pull of the moon, if I'm not mistaken.
---
It honestly depends on the class. Healers have a pretty good time (not the best mind you but very good) pvping as their raiding spec. Melee dps and hunters are next but they are missing out on a lot of utility.
---
I think I found my answer!
---
I know it's not class spesific, but Alchemy, Herbalism, cooking and fishing let's your control alot in the action house and will give you quite an advantage when it comes to raw materials and converting whatever you desire depending on prices.

Lots of gold there to make
---
T2 set is the point to know i beat the game. My enemies in pvp will know this fast ;)
---
Just speculation since I don’t really know.  There were originally separate servers for Australia, they just played on NA servers.  I’m assuming Blizzard needed to get the NA servers up and running first before the moved on to setting up EU.  The game wildly exceeded expectations, and they were frantically trying to get enough NA servers up and get them stable, that I would assume this was taking up all their resources (time and money) which prevented them from releasing EU earlier.
---
Oh, don't worry about it in that case. I wasn't considering that they might have been put on there before.
---
Haha doesn’t matter how many years it’s been, still hilarious.
---
If you are using shadow bolt while leveling your are doing it wrong.
---
Your supposed to be juggling 3 mobs with dots
---
Indeed, makes me laugh out loud every time :P
---
Maraudon got slept on after the first couple patches. Still a really cool instance.
---
WoD has server issues so bad that one of the then moderators of this sub closed the sub in protest. Those were fun, salty and drama filled days.
---
[Here is the OG version in its glorious Hidef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0VWJdE01M)
---
No worries, man! I just did my best to make sure they weren’t ignored with some layering or animation in the Thrall case!
---
1. Request 2 weeks of PTO. Leave 1-2 days in the middle where I will work from home so that projects dont get backlogged too badly and I dont feel guilty about needing out.
---
2. Stock up on general snacks: beef jerky, code red, and that sort of stuff.
---
3. Stock up on mini microwave snacks if not for nostalgia. Ham and cheese hot pockets, and those .79 burritos.
---
4. Since this will be occurring during the summer, I cant go full hermit for 2 weeks without feeling guilty. I'll make it a point to play pickup bball at least 2-4 times during the first 2 weeks.
---
5. Coordinate with friends, and friends of friends to try to avoid anybody I know from playing on a different server. Nothing is worse then playing for 3 weeks, only to find out your friends are playing somewhere else.
---
5. Duoboxing. I am running a rogue+ druid duobox to assist with leveling and discourage getting ganked. I'll need to prep my system with keyclone and related software.
---
a couple threads I've seen say warrior is the worst to try this on which is actually what I was planning to play. The class I had in mind next was frost mage and I think the difference in pvp/pve wouldn't be as noticable as warrior. Any take on this?
---
excellent contribution, thank you!
---
blasphemy
---
I've done Furbolgs before, and gave up 25% through bloodsail.  BUT NOT THIS TIME!
---
Will the game client be available for download a short time before we can play? I really hope I don't have to wait half a day for my crappy wifi to download all those gigs...
---
Some allready do. "class balance", "Classic+" etc.
---
July 4th is a Thursday, so it's probably not going to be then.
---
Servers setup? If i remember correctly blizz had major issues with keeping servers stable because of keeping up with the load. Imagine having to keep with the demand of us/aus without even expanding the market to europe...
---
Awesome! 21:9 Ultrawide pls!
---
There's a screenshot of a GM wearing a Legendary Ashbringer somewhere
---
DotTimer for DoT classes.
---
Banana bar - allows you to click on a marked mob without actually clicking on the mob.  If there is a skull and X marked in a raid you can just click on the big skull or X to target the mob.  Helps with fights with a lot of adds that you need to target quickly.
---
Bigwigs or Deadly Boss Mods. 
---
Unit Frames of some sort - I use Luna.
---
I believe in you too my dude.
---
As a Nelf Druid, I plan on getting the Dwarven Ram as my first mount.  I do hope to get all of the faction mounts eventually.
---
Plenty go guilds still farmed Sunwell even though they knew nothing was coming after. Plenty of guilds farmed ICC even though they knew nothing was coming after. Naxx wasn't farmed in retail as much because there simply wasn't enough time. It had nothing to do with lack of desire. You may not want to farm the last raid, but many more raiders will.
---
This
---
Just make sure you take over and kick everyone so its yours /s
---
&gt; So what's your plan for Classic? You gonna level to 60, go in and kill Baron RIvendare once, then never do UD Strat ever again? I mean, why you you want to kill a boss more than once?
---
I'm planning on doing the dungeons until I have the gear I need for raiding, and probably boosting some guildies if they need gear. If I'm playing a warrior (haven't decided yet) I might do them regularly as a gold-farming thing. Then I will do MC, and farm it for as long as the guild needs it. Same thing with BWL and AQ, if I get that far. If my guild manage to beat Naxx we will have to decide what to do next. Because as I have already said, a guild doesn't need Naxx gear for anything. There is no next step to do at that point, so why would we need to farm for even better gear? Unless we plan on speedrunning or something, then getting full naxx gear is obviously high prio. But I'm not very interested in that sort of speedrunning to be honest. 
---
I don't like farming for gear. I like progressing raids. But to progress raids I need to farm gear, and I appreciate the process as a whole, since it's very satisfying to beat things you have worked hard towards, even if that involves doing some things you don't like.
---
Isn't it going to use the same client only just connect to  classic server instance?
---
There were no AUS servers on release. Aussies, Kiwis and Asians all played on US servers early on.   
---
Further down the timeline they finally released Oceanic servers, I think Jubei'thos was the first (?) where a lot of the Oceanic and Asian playerbase went to for better ping.  
---
Personally I was based in Singapore and played with a bunch of Aussie goons, so I remember this well.
---
That was a random hypothetical date.... Good God man lol
---
&gt; It rewards skill
---
Lol what? It literally doesn't. It rewards time and gear and whoever you can manage to make premades with time and gear. 
---
It literally does everything it can to take skill out of the equation
---
Dalarian?
---
Archimonde was WoD though. They changed the radar capabilities in Legion so you couldn't do that anymore..
---
Bfa was so bad for overpopulation servers like illidan. It took me 6 hours to log into the game and when i did the game didnt give me the potion that insta kills you and i had to abandon the quest a few times until it worked
---
Dude the fight in stratholme is one of the hardest if not the hardest 5 man content in vanilla
---
I'm duoboxing, so I keep stressing about min maxing the interactions about any two classes.
---
Pretty much decided on rogue + druid. Cant beat 2x stealth.
---
I imagine there might be some sort of download Kind of like how to PTR works now. There will be a separate folder with some things that only classic wow uses. But as a whole it will use retails wow files. 
---
Though I could be super wrong
---
The class is godlike. Just not the ret spec.
---
You forgot your /s tag. /s
---
You are being sarcastic, but I work for a Fortune 500 company and we have traveling freezes for a quarter to beat earnings...
---
Heck I still remember the guy who ninja'd our Ulduar raid ID at the final boss in Wrath. Lonk, you're a jerk!
---
Warlocks have a great PvP and PvE build with SM/Ruin.
---
Some classes will need to respect to be be more useful in one or the other. 
---
Healers don't need to respec. a pure PvE build may miss a few "nice to haves" for PvP but will still heal fine
---
Sounds like a guild of trash players
---
A rare place for anyone to level is dustwallow marsh. You get quite a few quests in theramore. They just get higher levels fairly quickly.
---
There's always that one ninja lootin rogue on every server, it's easy to get infamous
---
Warlocks can too.
---
I think a player that plays way more and does not just raidlog should have priority over gear. There were some guys in my guild that were only online for farming and raids. Others were online 24/7 basically so they should in theory have more right to get the gear they want because they use it way more. And there are some items in the game that are bis forever for some classes. For example fel infused leggings are bis for shadow priest in pvp an pve. It has no crit on it so no warlock should ever want it anyway. Unless they are braindead.
---
Absolutely. Actually seeing their justification for some of the (in my opinion, bad) changes softened me up a bit - I can understand why they made said changes now, even though I don't agree with many of them.
---
I feel the way about Naxx. Also I did it in WotLK so many times. Which I know 10 man version is ridiculously easier and such, but it still feels like I've had the experience lore-wise.
---
Did u check metadata or how do you know? Serious Q :P
---
So don’t install it, i like having all of that on my screen if I want to look, never found myself staring at it/getting distracted by it
---
Well, since my blizzard app is basically always on, if they don’t seed the client before hand, I’d be surprised. Always seems to be downloading some new update.
---
Wait what are the ungoro soils? Quest items you can pickup without the quest?
---
Even getting rank 8 is no cakewalk for someone with a full time job.
---
If an undead is wearing a cloak, does the cloak cover up the spine on their back? 
---
Does it cover the shoulder bones protruding?
---
Setting a release date far in advance will just create more bugs. Releasing a finished product when it's ready is much better. Being told summer 2019 is pretty gracious of them.
---
Yeah, there weren't very many guilds that killed KT so the majority of those who collected their splinters had to wait until TBC release. But those who did were rewarded with a very convenient portal to the first raid!
---
Nice! Sick of people praising those silly Snow Lions.
---
so dont take this as glib but... if you are going to run a 40 man raid guild i think you should probably already have your own direction in mind for loot systems.
---
Someone else commented this but some popular streamer rolling somewhere and having an army of zoomers following them around
---
Yes, there are many.
---
it’s irrelevant to my point that no one had naxx on farm in vanilla. I don’t care about your private server non sense.
---
My bad, still 100g (90g with rep) is not that bad in 40 levels. Really hard if you are an enchanter. You lose out on a lot of extra gold.
---
What do you mean? Most guilds have a set raiding time, if you can't make it, don't join.
---
A+ logic. Release date announcement CONFIRMED YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST FOLKS
---
I remember walking into Ogrimmar after Kazak ravaged the place.. Skeletons everywhere.  It was so amazing at the time. Before I had realized what happened you asked.. What could have done this?
---
Looking for a guild (Horde- NA - PvP - EST)
---
I've raided from MC to AQ40, and have raided on private servers more recently.
---
I'm looking for a guild for raids 2-3 times a week. My schedule is fairly consistent so most times after 6 P.M. work for me. 
---
I'm planning on playing a forsaken mage, and know my way on how to be a mage from most raids till AQ40. I eventually plan on making a forsaken shadow priest but thats for much later. I also have experience as a holy priest but once again thats for after I have my mage well geared.
---
I plan on pvping as a mage aiming for rank 11 or 12, so a guild that has members that will want to pvp is a plus.
---
Just choose the same realm as your favourite streamer then
---
Its the new mentallity of todays gamers, people are only focused in min/max. What brought this on ? Who knows..  
---
But yeah back in vanilla, we did not have "pre-bis" you had to be decent gear before you started to raid that was about it.
---
When in doubt, grind.
---
+int helps learn weapon skill faster.
---
Alliance has better:
---
Lore 
---
Models
---
City Placement
---
Paladin
---
Quests
---
Zones
---
Generally, a better sense of community and camaraderie
---
Also you will likely outlevel your guild and end up waiting weeks for them to catch up. Some also just leave the guild at that time. I prefer to not join in the first place and to get a guild that is on the same page than me.
---
“Osconty” theory no doubt.
---
I have a video of this dude somewhere kicking my level 20 something Druid’s butt lol. Didn’t know what was going on at the time as I was a new player.
---
The idea isn't to get exactly all of that gear (at least not for most of us). It's more like a guide to the gear you should be aiming for during your gearing up process so you aren't spending time running dungeons you don't need to be running. For most guilds you'll grab a few pieces of pre-BiS and go from there. No reason to wait on 40 members to fully get their pre-BiS, MC just isn't that difficult. 
---
Same goes for BiS, it's just a road map to the raid gear you should be aiming to get. You don't need every single BiS peice from MC to do Ony and so on.
---
I get to 35 in 27 1/2 hours as a hunter if that helps
---
imo its very important to understand what the intention behind (what we would consider) bad changes were. Because you cant really learn from those mistakes otherwise. Class balance for example. So many players arguing to change classes in Classic. All these people dont understand that this is what ultimately lead to the shallow retail classes. And yet people still complain about balance. Class balance isnt a bad concept by any means. But it cant be as important as class Identity or eventually we will end with X classes all doing the same with different flavour texts.
---
You may not be aware, but if your dworfie has long hair then it spins when you cast a spell.
---
Cant say, but he's told me release dates for Blizzard content since 2012 and he's always been right.
---
Wake me up when September ends
---
Yeah, lootwhores who reserve stuff in leveling dungeons don't make alot of friends though. I personally don't join runs with reserved stuff, regardless if I want it or not. Except its a guild run at 60, where somebody got super unlucky over a multitude of runs. People who do that for a lvl 20 ring with 7 str on it  are completely ridiculous.
---
Yes. With plot armor we had the hidden chosen nightelf of anger who could stop the bronze mad titan using the power of the last Nauru. That is plot armor. The demons LITERALLY cannot die on Azeroth and one eredar warlock can summon thousands alone. 
---
If we weren't the main characters on the heroes journey we would have lost. End of conversation.
---
Pre-BiS is absolutely not required.  MC is launching in 1.12 state which means: talents, itemization, any bug fixes, debuff limit, etc **should** not be like pservers or OG vanilla.
---
Well you also never fight undead so you don't have to worry about your enemy using it.
---
Ehhhh yuck. Now that you mention it. I could see that happening.
---
why would you want to stop someone from the opposite side trying to grief their own faction
---
"LF1M Shaman DPS" - Problem solved. And now you have totems + battle rez + normal rez.
---
I think for casual guild with player turnover, a well allocated EPGP system works the best.
---
Oops, meant to say *weren’t.  Trying to type too fast on my phone never works well.
---
I did no know that, she has short hair and no spells.
---
That’s because it does.
---
&gt; In those 8 years, never have I ever heard about anyone talking about BiS or pre-BiS gear. 
---
I don't know what circles you ran with, but I was a piss poor raider in BC and we certainly had gear lists for tanking, because we had to hit certain stat breakpoints before we could handle the boss fights.
---
If you didn't know about BiS lists, that was simply a lack of information on your part.
---
Maybe I'm misjudging other players. It's mostly just assumptions from my side about most raiders having a similar mentality to me, maybe they don't.
---
There are people out there in positions of influence in the pserver sphere who think that you need to already have X to be eligible to receive Y, and to a lesser extent they are correct but they take the idea way too far. 
---
It is reasonable for you to skip some pre-raid bis items and get moving through MC and ZG, especially if your raid group already has it on farm. The trouble is when those in positions of authority over loot distribution decide that if you did not show up with the absolute most optimal gear possible, that you did not put in the effort and therefore you are not worthy of the reward. They will frequently award the drops to offspecs and alts over the mainspec main toon who they deem unworthy. 
---
The guilds in that pserver built around wrath talents and mechanics but in vanilla content is a particularly egregious offender in this vein.
---
Thankfully, when Classic comes out these voices will be diluted to the point of being noise and you can realistically expect that "good enough" truly is good enough.
---
I want Classic as it used to be. I dont mind a Classic+ eventually that does not replace the museum Classic. And if it was done well I absolutely would play it. But no changes in Classic.
---
"WHAT DO WE WANT?"
---
"Pies!"
---
"WHEN DO WE WANT IT?"
---
*Jimface*
---
Kiting that son of gruul to your factions village was probably the most common way to wrap up that quest in nagrand. So yes, kiting mobs a long way was possible all through vanilla. Kiting mobs across multiple zones probably wasn't.
---
July what though?? You realise we gon put you on blast if you're wrong
---
So sick of these posts making big claims but not substantiating anything.
---
murloc quests, basically lethal
---
You may assume it’s more efficient, but it really isn’t. Alliance side has some great synergies as well, and a number of zones where you can compact a huge pile of quests into high xp/hr.
---
gs will not work, some greens were better than purples
---
overall, pre-raid gear just sucked, just have enough hp to survive and have some common sense to get out of the fire/etc really. then monitor damage meter to make sure they're throwing the right spells
---
one reason you need a good class leader, they'll know pre-raid bis for that class the best
---
Sounding a bit like a bullyboi fam
---
As long as you keep damaging them, NPCs keep chasing you. That wasn't changed globally, so I would think its a more specific change
---
Misc RP Addon's - Character Sheets etc.

---
I’m a believer it caused a lot more experimentation because people were trying and playing weird specs to make them work in PvP and pve.  But hey that’s just my thoughts on it.
---
I could get behind that
---
Booooo
---
That's a good point and tough 'cause player reaction is so hard to judge and quantify. I think that's what I'm afraid of, too. Not "modern players are gonna ruin classic," but certain modern mind-sets could.
---
Nothing stopping you from ignoring those lists. It's the math that will stop you from raiding however.
---
Pre-BIS and BIS and raid progression is a mathematical model. Assuming perfect tactics so we can isolate a benchmark, you will never kill a raid boss if your raid cannot do enough damage. It's designed for that. Your raid potential can literally be calculated but it's far easier for the individual to know what gear they should be trying to get so an entire raid can cross over the threshold required for minimal success. Figuring this out is part of the game.
---
Success even in pvp is largely dependent upon gear, so knowing what is best for that play style helps immensely too. This doesn't even factor in that you will save countless hours of play time by actually knowing where and how to get this gear.
---
It's not so much a obsession. It's just simply reasoning and logic. These BIS lists exist so a player can be responsible and learn how to succeed at a game that requires 40 person cooperation.
---
By all means, DON'T care about BIS lists. Raid guilds will learn that you don't care about the interest of the guild, and promote you to raid obscurity. Welcome to a cooperative game.
---
Great! Sounds doable!
---
Yeah, nobody actually assemble full bis.. And you are not the only one around that does not give a single duck about them. They do have some use still:
---
- The lists are made mostly as guides to help people gear up their characters as vanilla items can sometimes be confusing.
---
- The pre-raid bis are also used as a metric in elite guilds to find players that are dedicated and do their preparation.
---
- Once you know someone and have a level of trust in each others competance within a guild the exact items do not matter at all. 
---
- Hence why bis-lists in later tiers work more as a tool for class leaders and loot councils to get an idea of how far in gear progression  members are. 
---
- They also serve as an wishlist for players who like to set goals for themselves.
---
There's always 2-3 items for each slot In a bis list, so if u can't get the best u have other options
---
Vanilla has a large selection of items but it all essentially boils down to 3 or 4 stats per class.
---
This enforces the idea of "best in slot", knowing which combinations of gear give you the best stats, therefore DPS.
---
It doesn't exist in WoW anymore because of all the options.
---
Most people ding 17, get the quests and jump right in.
---
Make sure your main tank has most of his pre-raid BiS. Other than that you can do MC with a vast majority of your DPS in questing greens...
---
The auction house / economy in general. Not because retail is any better than vanilla in that regard, but because I think the auction house doesnt fit in well with the classic design philosophy.
---
Imo, it was to test the audience. See How it goes in homeland then release abroad. If it were a bust in US, they wouldnt have lost money releasing it in EU
---
You will face many no straight forward situations, which I find great as they make many game aspect more valuable.
---
Examples: profession trainers locations, training different weapon skill in specific cities, using meeting stones to summon party at instance location. It's like completely different game with similat graphics.
---
Learning and adaptation goes smooth as most of the things are intuitive.
---
i’ve always wondered: if you leash kazzak to a city and he dies to the sheer amount of people attacking him, you get his loot right? like, you and only you?
---
Realistically, that will never happen though. The second Kazzak spawns, there will be at least 1 horde and alliance guild forming to fight for it. The opposing faction will kill you the second you try to kite him.
---
Yep bro, it's called Google and ur finger are the add-on
---
I don't think I'm very plugged into this. Maybe they're just no big streamers on my realm/in my battlegroup, but how does this manifest in modern WoW and Vanilla servers?
---
Sounds like a guild of players who care that they down the boss, not whether they're on top of the meters.
---
Clicker :)
---
Never thought to look at dwarf females.
---
Next time I encounter one I'll emote a /whistle and not engage in combat. :D
---
Troll females though is where it's at, man.
---
I genuinely don't think I finished a Sunken Temple run until WOTLK. Just couldn't do it.
---
My thoughts exactly. You both need it?
---
\&gt;   we had to hit certain stat breakpoints before we could handle the boss fights. 
---
You had to get your defense cap, that's about it.
---
\&gt;  If you didn't know about BiS lists, that was simply a lack of information on your part.
---
I was elbow deep at theorycrafting at the time. That's the thing: absolute BiS lists are not very useful. You had gear lists in terms of how they rank with each other and you'd try getting as far up that list as you could. Just look at this:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/asfpne/bislist\_for\_every\_stage\_release\_naxxramasall/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/asfpne/bislist_for_every_stage_release_naxxramasall/)
---
There are many pieces that are 97% as good as the "best" piece. Yet they're not the best, therefore they aren't considered at all. Lastly, absolute BiS only works if you have it all, since stat weights change depending on how much of other stats you currently have.
---
Most players are not on subreddits for the game. Most of them are pretty clueless.
---
We also did crazy things like start a raid less than 40 people until we could get all 40 with stragglers.  Maybe not in top guilds but your average social Guild did. We used to even grab 10 people from a non raiding guild to help fill slots. 
---
Only things I remember optimizing ever raid was the roles. Number of healers, tanks, cc, tranq shot
---
You can use up to plate so you will get plenty of healing gear and might be running around in a dress for a while.
---
When you have no other interests in life, people spend days/weeks on incremental differences and act like anyone who 'only' did the majority of the work isn't doing enough to 'deserve' to go with them.
---
I saw the sun today. I started getting that prickly feeling that means my skin hasn't decided if it wants to burn from being cooped up all winter or if it wants to tan due to genetics.
---
Sun is overrated, I want classic wow.
---
All phases will probably come out in more than a year
---
Someone made a website that lists BiS at every stage and posted it in this sub. Do a search.
---
I'm fully expecting a decent amount of people complaining about it but again, I doubt it will be a really big amount.  
---
  It's been years upon years, basically everyone knows how classic works either they read themselves or other people.
---
The irony is that many of these leveling "challenges" are products of the modern game. The current leveling process is so easy, so mind-numbingly boring, so unrewarding, and so anti-social that murdering boars for hours is potentially considered a superior experience to what the actual game systems have to offer.
---
Back in vanilla, I ran SM Cath or Armory (cant remember) with some guildies. We found a chest so we all rolled for it. I won, but our chickenshit dwarf pally was already starting to loot the chest. He demanded we reroll because there was a Zealot Blade in the chest, and refused to stop looting until we all rolled again. Luckily I won again, but I made the mistake of not kicking him from our group/guild right there. Later when we were running MC with our full 40 group, it was his first time and he was whispering every pally in the guild to let him win the loot cause it was his first time, and was bitching when he didn't get it, despite having 0 DKP.
---
There's no room for tolerance for greedy pieces of shit anymore. If you need something for the money or try to pull chicken shit like that, you're getting kicked immediately.
---
Phase 2?? But I don't have my bomb shelter finished yet!
---
Two things:
---
Soul shard management and not seeing healing text/numbers above players when you heal them.
---
RAIS_Autoshot or any other tracker for auto shot timers for hunters.
---
Hell, my guild would go into MC just to farm trash to get BoE set pieces.
---
Because u are wrong son. Best horde guilds use crul Orc tanks, which shits on every other 1her not named thunderfury for threat.
---
Starting trash pulls while the stragglers get to the raid is a tradition as old as raiding itself.
---
Pre-bis and bis year absolutely did exist in all eras of wow. This is misinformation from a casual player point of view (Still a casual player). It is also highly unintelligent and naive to suggest that wanting to be the best you can be is a bad thing.
---
This is legit really difficult to wrap my mind around. A simple dungeon map is such a giant QoL change... honestly sometimes when I'm in dungeons I think about not having maps in Classic and I'm just like "I need to cross that bridge when I get to it or else I'm gonna freak out." Maybe I only panic because for some reason back then I wouldn't use the internet to figure out dungeons and would just rely on my guildies or general chat... rip.
---
I have a friend planning to go warlock so I'll pass that info on. How do frost mages fair when it comes to doing both under the same spec ? 
---
+ty for the information so far
---
Not OP, but with a gear swap, can 29/11/11 heal/tank dungeons like HOTW can?
---
They better revert Blink bug fixes then
---
Don't want to cannibalize retail
---
It's been a long time, but I remember that I needed to be uncrushable, have a certain amount of armour, a certain amount of HP, and a certain amount of hit chance. Because I needed to be able to not take crits, I needed to survive a hit with enough HP to get healed up, and I needed to not miss taunts ever. It was a very specific list like, "This crafted item, this quest item, this dungeon item", etc. etc. It was a lot more than one stat that had to be taken into account.
---
The chad vanilla player vs the insecure bis virgin
---
&gt; By all means, DON'T care about BIS lists. Raid guilds will learn that  you don't care about the interest of the guild, and promote you to raid obscurity.  
---
How are those two related, exactly? I've done a lot of TBC, then WotLK heroic and later renamed to mythic raiding in the past, and none of this ever mattered. Those lists can take months to acquire and as I mentioned in my OP, no sane guild would wait for everyone get them.
---
The Atiesh quest in Stratholme was unexpectedly difficult for people in T3, but we also went in blind. Lore was good too, though I can't remember the details anymore.
---
people do mc on fresh servers with lvl 55 people
---
Try hards will be piling up at their 0.0001% chance to get some legendary items to wtf pwn losers in PvP for their 14 person Twitch streams
---
If there was any time where Classic could destroy retail its the middle of BFA. During Legion maybe not but BFA is the best time for Classic come out of it wants to trump retail.
---
I get the best gear I can so I'm not the one holding others back in the raid.
---
What was the fastest class in Early wow out in the world?
---
For example now in BFA I play DK a lot but I am so slow compared to cat form on my druid.
---
I think either druids or rogues were the fastest but I am not sure as I started playing in BC. 
---
Anyone know for sure? I basically want to cut down on travel time anyway I can since I hate it.
---
This is true. But the first year will be hectic only really because of Rank 14. Everything else on that list can be obtained later on and over time.
---
Can you imagine the chaos?
---
we know how their kit works... It sucks.
---
I remember this being big in TBC. PUG groups of 15-20 people doing TK and SSC trash for the BoE drops.
---
Jumping up and down is a good way to get the sand out of your vagina.
---
Lmao I love that first guy. Loosely translated he basically yelled "Let's go everyone attack him! If we die then... whatever!"
---
itemlevel had its use in Vanilla. Enchantrix e.g. used it to calculate type and amount of disenchantment mats.
---
Yes, MC doesn't drive the need for pre-BIS early on. People still want their pre-BIS for all areas of the game obviously as some pre-BIS is literally BIS for some slots. Not everyone shoots for pure MC gear obviously as it tends to be very spec specific.
---
Obtaining dungeon pre-BIS can launch a guild directly into T2 actually, especially once DM releases. Great thing really, because tons of players in Classic will be dungeon runners and only casual raiders and getting into groups should remain easy to do for a very long time.
---
I don’t know whether to destroy this post or go along with the meme..
---
Hey me and my buddy were thinking about joining a late night pst group. If we couldnt find one we were going to start one. I am going to be going full tank mode from launch until naxx.
---
If you wouldn't mind sending the discord through direct message, I would love to help get it going!
---
Petyr Baelish:  😏
---
The classes are all simple so there shouldn't be much of a learning curve. Warrior is probably the most brutal class to level though. More than one equal level mob is quite often a death sentence (no joke), and they kill fairly slow. If you do insist on going Warrior though, ALWAYS keep first-aid up to date.
---
Welp... There may be potential I got scammed from r/gear4sale then... He hasn't contacted me either.
---
We don't know yet, we have to wait and see when it releases. Just about everyone has expressed interest in streaming it, though. There will be people who stream Classic just because it's the new hotness, fairweather fans, and people who've historically shit on Vanilla WoW.
---
titbits.
---
Only because I main a Lock. They were always a hard fight for me in Vanilla.
---
Warriors are fun, though. A bit of a slog to level early on but still fun.
---
It is the freedom
---
It's not at all a bad thing to know and aim for a pre-BiS list. The bad thing is trying to claim that you absolutely need your pre-BiS to even attempt MC. All your members should be attempting to gear themselves as best they can, but MC can be done with your DPS is questing greens if they know the fights. So there's no reason to heavily delay your entrance into MC waiting on your DPS to farm for months.
---
Any good rep out of those?
---
&gt;  we had the hidden chosen nightelf of anger who could stop the bronze mad titan using the power of the last Nauru.
---
TIL all fantasy stories are just Plot Armor. 
---
&gt; The demons LITERALLY cannot die on Azeroth
---
Yes, they can. If they are killed near a location where the Twisted Nether is leaking into Azeroth (or any mortal world), or in an area suffused with Fel Magic.
---
&gt; one eredar warlock can summon thousands alone.
---
And? Eredar leaders have been killed by the denizens of Azeroth several times, they can also summon/bind demons, and can kill them by the thousands.
---
&gt; If we weren't the main characters on the heroes journey we would have lost. 
---
Like all fantasy stories? Wow....
---
&gt;End of conversation.
---
You seem like a real chode, rofl. "End of conversation" *Folds arm in nerdrage*
---
Inb4 "OMG YOU SAID THE NAUGHTY WORD, THIS CLEARLY MEANS I'M RIGHT"
---
PTR just dropped. It will go for 8 weeks 8.2 launching in early June. One month later we get Classic to contest FInal Fantasy release and keep people resubbed who just checked out 8.2 with a one month subscription = Tuesday, 2nd July
---
I think that an announcement like like would be awful. There are only so many sick days we can use without too many questions asked.
---
Pre-raid BiS is a QOL requirement more than anything. Sure you can bring people that are not pre-raid BiS into a raid and carry them with people who are pre-raid BiS, but if a majority of your raid is not pre-raid BiS you will have a tough time downing bosses and trash depending on the raid/instance. 
---
Pre-raid BiS is something to work towards so you make raiding that much more easier and less frustrating for everyone.
---
Well, good luck... that’s not going to be simple!
---
It's the worst thing I'm not looking forward to.  25 is bad enough.  
---
It really makes me wonder why they chose Classic and not TBC.  For all the "herp derp flying ruined WoW" people, TBC seemed to fix the flaws of Vanilla but not make things as silly as it got in Wrath and beyond.
---
So so good haha
---
The oceanic servers that came out were actually just labelled oceanic, they were still us based severs physically. It took them nearly 10years, around the time WoD came out to actually have Australian physical servers.
---
Why do people get so wound up when they see the word botting? Genuinely curious - we're talking about teenagers messing about with computers years ago here. 
---
I remember there was some kind of legal battle from blizzard against the bot developer at the time. It's actually quite interesting
---
That‘s a great time. My only concern is if i can manage to level him before the total shit show that phase two will be
---
Take away every fury warrior but 1-2 and that's a big reason why retail struggled. Dw fury didnt become viable until aq lunch with the talent changes and ppl didn't figure out how op they were until later.
---
No Changes - EU wants a release date 3 Months after US and AUS
---
My server went down for about 2 hours on BFA launch. All things considered, far from the worst release.
---
&gt; I’m pretty much as #nochange as the next guy.
---
&gt;However, there is one thing I really want to see gone. 
---
I'm doubtin'
---
Frost mages remain frost for MC, BWL and Ony (mobs or resistant or immune to fire).  Normally mages go Fire for AQ and beyond because the dps is much higher.  This obviously means that mages respec a lot in higher end raiding situations.
---
Warrior depends if you are Fury or Prot for raids obviously.  I am not as knowledgable about pvp vs pve cross-over for warriors so I will leave that so someone else.
---
Druids followed by hunters/shamans
---
bagnon is buggy on pservers and sometimes ignores one of your bags completely. onebag doesnt have this problem.
---
of course that wont really matter given that classic will use the new wow engine
---
No people would kite bosses to cities and let destruction ensue. When I was a kid I played a hunter and practiced my kiting skill(a desirable trait from hunters) by kiting high level mobs and bosses to SW. It would take like an hour of kiting to get this boss there. There were also some unkillable mobs that I would bring to the keep until a GM would despawn them.
---
We farmed sunwell trash for gems and crafting recipes. Never even killed a boss.
---
No you're wrong because literally everything is plot armor in WoW. That's why onyxia didn't squish windsor. that's why nefarian didn't release his dragons on stormwind. The list goes on. It is plot armor because nobody wants to be picked up by the titan the size of the planet and crushed like the fucking insect they are, then lose all their progress.
---
Well if the confirmation box said what you clicked instead of just picking up this item will bind it to you (or whatever it is) this wouldn't be such a problem. 
---
I don't want to be that go so I'm quite often cancelling then clicking greed again just to make sure I didn't need accidently.
---
Can confirm, I was recipient and had been managing the guild bank and non-social nitty-gritty of the guild since we stepped foot in MC. Was a little ticked when another caster was seriously considered, but had long-since publicly recused myself from that loot council decision which is probably what kept the drama down.
---
People also got a little salty when another officer got the Scarab Lord nod, but none of them were willing to put in the hours in Silithus after additional quest items were available.
---
I used Atiesh through KZ since we were heavy on casters until I got that dagger (as nearly last priority -_- )
---
Warrior mage rogue will be the most played classes because they do the most damage in raids. A lot of non/maxers will be playing classic.
---
I think of they go deep frost it's also fine for PvP and PvE. But I'm not an expert on mages. So that that with a grain of salt
---
Excuse you, the Kara portal was the "best" outcome during mage portal roulette. "Best" from my perspective...
---
It's an RPG game about progressing and improving your character and you're suprised that some people want to be the best they can be?
---
&gt; They are probably gonna change up the API
---
Yeah it does not make any kind of sense for Blizzard to maintain two versions of the API and engine. I expect that retail and classic will share damn near everything with the differences being exclusively restricted to zone layouts and scripting.
---
How flimsy and shallow does your hype have to be for a class being popular to kill it lol?
---
I skipped TBC but I think it's when most classes and specs became viable and where they addressed a lot of the meta issues in vanilla (like how bad the ranking PvP system was)
---
Lol, okay.
---
Timewalking is not anything like vanilla. There's no threat, tons of aoe skills, crazy mana regeneration and last time I checked you could use legion legendaries in timewalking.
---
he means for ranking a person
---
Interestingly, the raven animation would proc "on cast" trinkets. Weird as hell when mounted :V
---
Because 2004 was a time when it was still completely normal for localisation of games, movies, tv shows etc. to take months, if not years, and Europe has like a billion different languages companies can translate their product into if they deem it profitable. Simultaneous worldwide releases of things only really became a thing when technology and budgets (thanks to ever increasing demand and therefore, profits) started allowing for it.
---
Maraudon quest run the first time you do it, takes 3 hours. Can take 4 (happened to me) if people leave mid dungeon or if your group is weak and you keep dying. But with that said I like Maraudon more than ST and RFD. It's such a cool place.
---
Pally is brutally slow leveling.  You do very little damage but never die.  World PVP is about the same, little damage but tough to actually kill.
---
Feral druid you have a whole toolbox.  I got jumped but a warrior in Burning Steppes one time (max level example sorry).  I rooted and moonfired him forever.  Eventually it would break and I'd switch to bear, we'd trade off and kite each other.  I would get him rooted again and rinse repeat.  The fight lasted 10 minute and spanned a good 1/4 of the zone.  I eventually beat him with a lucky maul crit when both of use were low health.  It was epic and I am not even a great pvp'er.  
---
TLDR - druid, much more complex, bigger toolbox.  A lot of strategy and escape options.  Person opinion though.
---
Oh yea there’s videos of a shaman off tanking mc
---
9 classes at 60 with 1 tank 1 dps 1 healer in max BiS Naxx gear. 
---
 Plus max gold on a character.
---
I hope it takes me years!
---
Australia uses NA servers.
---
You’ll be dropping it for ZG, then presumably leveling it up again when you replace Bloodvine.
---
Exactly.  So I find it a bit funny how many people want Classic when there are glaring flaws (class design) and thing like 40 man raids which take a lot of coordination.
---
Yeah. You can get them from mobs and there are patches of dirt that you can interact with to get them. Then theres  short quest chain from a female tauren (elder or spirit bluff) that gives you this item that consumes the soil and other reagent in for a box you open that has random stuff like potions food and herbs. If you get enough of this grass shit you turn it in to her (its repeatable) and you can get some stuff from what she gives you (maybe xp too. I cant remember). 
---
I'll try to find the quest for you in a bit when I'm off work
---
Maybe, but I'm still pretty certain that small groups of people will want to kite him just for shits and giggles.  Faction won't have much to do with it.
---
EPGP uses fixed pricing. Its quite a bad system for hoarding prio though.
---
beautiful

---
We use them on Huhuran. You can see the boss at 16min 50 seconds. We all use Peasant Callers when the boss gets to 30%.
---
Dude the foundry room is no joke
---
Imagine wanting to play a Feral Druid in Classic... lol
---
Good luck seeing all the content.
---
#I was There
---
America?
---
Shandralar? Ravenholdt?
---
What do you see as the problem?
---
&gt; "Did not expect it" (Right...)
---
I think you're really underestimating how deluded blizz is when it comes to people hype for classic.  
---
  I think this is the ONE time blizz actually could not expect it.
---
Hahahahaha, Noooooooooo!
---
In that case; anyone got a cheap-ass trailer somewhere I can rent for 3 months? Preferably on the East-Coast
---
Yeah I'm actually skeptical I'll play classic now.  The leveling is grueling and I *do not* want to have to rely on 39 other people to raid so the whole thing seems pointless to me.
---
I’m thinking of rolling a Druid once classic launches. I know balance and guardian is out of the question. I wouldn’t mind doing some healing, but is feral a decent spec? I plan to raid, but mostly PvP.
---
I'd think that falls within the category of being highly over geared for such things, but ya, it can work fine for dungeons. By the time you can properly gear the balance hybrid build, you likely have tons of gear for a variety of specs.
---
The build is primarily caster though. You put the 11 in feral in order to use Bear as your defense and interrupt/escape tactic, so basically utility. You just get far more out of Bear than Moonkin. 11 in Resto is to get Furor (critical for any feral form use), push back resist and your extra dot.
---
It plays like a highly mobile, stealth caster using their tools to survive in close range and regain range for more magic spam. I'm like you though, the actual play style I've only seen from others. I never obtained a great hybrid set and support gear to pull the trigger on that build.
---
In the hands of the right player, the balance hybrid build may be the most adaptive 1v1/world pvp spec in the game.
---
Was this something fixed by BC? Because I did ZF a million times around 2007 and never had this issue
---
They are pushing the BFA 8.2 PTR info atm, dont expect anything until thursday at the earliest
---
Very cool!
---
I think his point was not that it was difficult mechanically to get, but that the recipient is basically handed a guild "Lifetime Achievement" award and is socially hard to get.
---
I assume they'll let a couple of these "events" happen before patching.
---
I'm pretty sure he wants to see your server and character name to see your achievs dates. If characters legitimately did content in vanilla they would have achievs from the day they were implemented into the game. A lot of people fake these "look at my old toon" thing for karma. 
---
I don't think you're lying though.
---
I do love dwarf racial mounts. Even as a Horde player it's potentially my favorite racial mount.
---
Stoneform isn't quite as good on a paladin as you have multiple options for dealing with the things that Stoneform takes care of.
---
Can confirm, crushing perfecting of the dwarf female would destroy the server if &gt;5%.
---
Oh there will be people who try, but until the top guilds have no need for him anymore , there’s no chance. So it’s going to be a veeeeeeery long time before it will be a problem.
---
It did? How do you know if you were selected?
---
The people who say this shit have never made it to endgame , let alone finished all the raid tiers. A feral as a 3rd or 4th tank is amazing, and will do way more dmg than your tank warrior who is deadweight during the encounters he’s not tanking anything.
---
I think it'll be a good experience but yeah, coordinating 40 people when they are working adults, not school/college kids who can stay at home all day and play will be a real hassle.
---
Not me, as a Hunter I just see free HKs. Delicious
---
90% of people who want to raid as feral don't even know about the MCP and will be shocked then they need to farm them
---
//People who do that for a lvl 20 ring with 7 str on it are completely ridiculous.//
---
I suppose this would be true, if this weren't a game, and that opinions on values weren't subjective. As for myself and others, I value my time, and if I'm advertising "LF1M SFK, need dps, [Silverlaine's Family Seal] reserved", I'm scarcely inconveniencing the people who read that and choose to pass on it, compared to how inconvenienced *I* would be if I did hours on hours of Shadowfang Keep and lost 2-3 rolls on the ring on the few runs that it even dropped.
---
It was 8 HM 17DW.
---
I see a couple of them back peddling x)
---
Also because they're basically the most popular dnd classes since the beginning of time.
---
Sweet. Requesting badass (undead female) shadow priest.
---
On the other hand, I was in a guild that prevented me from getting an upgrade because I lacked DKP, then several months later I wasnt allowed to use the DKP on an upgrade because it wouldnt be fair to new members that haven't been able to accumulate DKP. I was like, "well if I lose this roll i'll /gquit and you can find a new top dps". They didn't take me seriously, I lost the roll and Gquit.
---
Ah yeah my bad. Still don’t think ppl willing to lose dkp for someone else
---
Sounds like the real classic experience to me.
---
OOOH yes please!! :)
---
When you entered Shade of Aran's room in Karazhan with Atiesh equipped, Aran would have extra dialogue. I didn't even know it was different until someone pointed out the addition.
---
&gt; Where did you get that? Did *he* send you?!
---
&gt; In those 8 years, never have I ever heard about anyone talking about BiS or pre-BiS gear.
---
WoW Vanilla is 15 years old - every inch of the game has been mapped out, including the loot tables.  Hence why people know exactly what is Best in Slot at every stage of the game and every patch.
---
But nobody NEEDS leveling blues from dungeons. You WANT it. 
---
You can easily level to 60 with quest gear alone.
---
💀💀💀💀
---
As a life long warlock - however many my soul shard bag holds.  You need 1 soulstone every 30 minutes and a handful of healthstones (mostly personal use, people rarely ask for them).  Besides that you need a bunch at the beginning of any raid to summon stragglers.  As long as you have enough for summoning in the beginning you can farm more as the raid progresses.
---
I would worry more about health potions, mana potions and LIPs early on.  LIP = Limited Invul Potion.  Basically if your first shadowbolt crits and you pull the boss, the LIP gives you an aggro drop for a handful of seconds.  It goes back on the tank and when your LIP wears off the tank almost always has the aggro again.  Really good to prevent yourself from looking stupid, pulling a boss, dying and maybe wiping the raid.
---
If crowd pummeler works on live servers, private server discovery, feral druids will get decent use. Highly unlikely that it works though since it will be actual servers.
---
Its different in vanilla pservers and even Classic now. 
---
Early days, people didnt really know what gear came from where and there were no definitive lists anywhere. Vanilla gear was more complex in that stats were all over the place. Despite the fact that the correct gear would have been obvious to find, there were a loooooooooot of loudmouths out there that would push for other stats being more important. ie. There were people out there that weighted Intellect more heavily over spell power. The time thats passed has really quashed that idea and the community as a whole has come up with consensus on what stats are most important.
---
This carried on into BC when it first released and by the time you were in Kara gear, there wasnt really much to debate, because after you got into your epic gear in BC, it was fairly obvious which pieces were the most powerful. WotLK gear was extremely streamlined and when GS became a thing there didnt need to be any definitive list.
---
I dont think its so much of an obsession, just that theres a lot of bad gear in Vanilla, so its easier when people have a single thing to point to and the pre-raid BiS lists are good resources.
---
As for pserver meta, i havent ever heard of a guild not going into MC because people are missing pre-raid BiS gear.
---
I hate how balanced they tried to make stuff in retail. It’s nice to have counters and shit. And if something is OP, jump on the train. Plenty of specs are viable. PvP is so much more fun this way than what it is now.
---
Hinterlands (if all the quests are added)
---
Let me guess you are going for big dick dps class? I will roll a healer with gathering professions and I refuse to be a walking honor pinata 24/7 while out there. There is nothign to gain for me at pvp servers.
---
Haha, we just finally got rid of loading times :D
---
But damn, if that isn't the best feedback I've had in the past year!
---
Since you actually seem to want to have a conversation I'll take the time to respond!
---
&gt;It's not never-ending, there are limits to what is possible.
---
My initial point was more in terms of scaling content like this, I am in general opposed to any system that forces you to redo content at constantly increasing difficulties.  I think it's boring, and extremely lazy, instead of actually making a really hard dungeon, they just massively increase stats, and add a time limit (what really makes M+ hard).  And while it isn't technically never ending, for all but a small percentage of the population it effectively is.  Again this is Diablo in WoW, a lot of changes in the recent iteration of WoW seem to be largely influenced by Diablo, and are driven primarily to keep you constantly playing, striving for some new minor goal.
---
&gt;Why isn't it content? 
---
Ok, let's be clear, it obviously is content, I was being a bit hyperbolic, it's not new content, or in my opinion meaningful content, again we are just scaling something we already did up to do it again, and again, and again, to me, and albeit only to me it's pointless.  An MMO is supposed to be a world we play in, mythic + is way to gamey for me.
---
&gt;What's wrong with putting similar game modes in different games?
---
I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with it when it works, but in this case I don't think it does.  I'm not sure what content was like at end game in D2, but in D3, you are doing something very like M+ where you just turn up the difficulty, and I think it has 20 or settings, and rifts, kind of D3 dungeons, have a lot more.
---
&gt;Easy dungeons like in vanilla? Where the only somewhat engaging thing you could do with them after gearing up is speedrunning the same easy thing trying to improve clear times?
---
For what it's worth, in vanilla they weren't all that easy, we had a bitch of a time with them.  And I definitely would love them to retune all end game PVE content to actually be difficult again, they are going to regret not doing that immensely.
---
&gt;What do you want?
---
Essentially the end game as it was in TBC with a few more dungeons added throughout the run like Magister's Terrace, yes I realize we had two dungeons difficulties then, call me a hypocrite, but I can deal with two.  The heroics in TBC were brutal, and gave decent gear, and retained the stratification necessary to preserve content.  One of the biggest issues in modern WoW is how quickly people are able to burn through content, and the reason for this is how plentiful and easy to come by gear is.  M+ is a particularly disruptive gearing device that basically guarantees every raid tier dies when the next is released, you cannot have a system like this in the game and preserve content progression, players simply gear too quickly weather they are progressing the raid or not.  To be fair this was already happening before M+ was added to the game, but if you're goal was to fix this problem, M+ is now a big part of it.
---
I don't have any issue with M+ in a vacuum, it's not for me, but I get (well not really, I think you're all insane, lol) why people like it.  If it was completely divorced from the gear grind I'd be fine with it, if it were cosmetic only I think that would be awesome.  As it stands it's an integral part of the gearing process for pretty much anyone that cares.
---
Hopefully, I at least addressed most of your questions?
---
I used to stay up until 5-6am GMT in order to download episodes of 24 as soon as they hit IRC/FTP servers, lol.
---
Now UK cable simulcasts Game of Thrones at 2am.
---
I looked it up, looks like a private server pic. For one thing the DPS is lower than the uncorrupted version and secondly it only has inflicts fire damage as a special ability which lore wise doesn't seem right.
---
Fair enough, to each their own. I guess in my eyes, I always assumed most people had multiple reasons for wanting to raid.
---
1. They enjoy playing with their guild/ friends
---
2. They want the satisfaction of working together to accomplish a goal (IE: Killing a boss)
---
I guess here is where you have people who either only care about one of the below points or both.
---
3. They want gear to continue to be competitive and accomplish more goals
---
4. They want gear to show off their hard work and as a "badge of honor" to show what they've accomplished.
---
I guess if you only care about point 3, you wouldn't want to raid after killing KT. But for those that care about point 4, or both, they would want to continue to raid until fully geared.
---
I would assume most people care about both 3 and 4 due to the fact that in live WoW, so many people care about mounts and titles received from doing hard content to prove to others of their accomplishments. Back in Vanilla, there weren't really any titles, so the only way to prove what you had done was by how good your gear was.
---
I wonder when this actually came out.  I certainly remember seeing it back then and still have it saved in photos I've transferred over the years!  Still holds up.
---
I love that Classic had Low-Level Epics Hunter can roll on.
---
Why did i read this the way littlefinger says ''Chaos is a ladder''
---
You made the right decision. It'd be one thing if the guild had a policy to let new members get some loot (probably with the caveat that no one with DKP needs the item for more than a minor upgrade or sidegrade), but they didn't do it for you, so they're just being inconsistent, which is unfair to you and anyone else that wants to spend the DKP on it. A lot of people think DKP rigs the system in favor of longterm raiders, but it's literally a system that pays off the dedication of those people. I would've quit on the spot if I were in your place as well.
---
During retail the items changed a lot. I never heard of BiS until pservers.  Progressive itemization is a relatively new thing on those servers. So up until recently all stats were entirely static on those servers. You can calculate the best sets / combinations of gear on every stage of content release before the server is even available. Your myth about getting pre-bis before going to the next tier is wrong. These sets are Goals you put until the next tier is out. You wont get them without being really lucky. I once heard a rumor about people killing Illidan with loads of people still using tier 3 sets. It's absolutely not necessary to have pre-bis.
---
I really like having these sets because of multiple reasons:  
---
1. It gives a player something more to get other than just completing the content. Similar to how people like to collect transmog sets or whatever in retail.
---
2. It gives a raid leader something to see if a player is competent and has done their research when inviting to pugs. They can check to see if you are working towards something or if you are there for a ride. It's not like they can check if you're mechanically capable through inspection or your "word"...
---
3. Several years of tests and simulations have proved it to do the highest dmg, best tanking and most healing. Live to win.
---
mob tagging in busy zones
---
targetted harassment of players by streamer fanboys. obviously not explicitly encouraged but you cant stop the masses from doing whatever
---
Well thank you for ending my hopes and dreams.
---
Sincerely, a full-time salary worker.
---
I started in tbc but I remember I got pretty much every class to 20 before I got anything past 30. Idk why , I wasnt intentially doing it but i got sick of every class by then. MMO's hadnt really clciked with me yet. Now i kinda regret it because even in live i still have all these characters that I eventually leveled to the cap and i still keep switching. im looking forward to just making 1 or 2 in classic and not more
---
Ret Pally's in a distant 3rd, but Druids are the fastest, on average, by far
---
Someone having pre-BiS shows that they're dedicated and knowledgeable enough for a guild to invest into. It's like a resume when you apply for a job. Having a degree doesn't guarantee a great employee, but it's a much safer bet than someone you don't know anything about.
---
Nobody refrains from progressing through tiers because they haven't got all BiS from the previous one. Not sure where you got that idea. I have never in my life heard of that. Guilds will raid as much as they're able to at any given time, and having BiS is just a measurement of your gear level.
---
There's no *obsession* with BiS, but it's completely natural to talk about it, for all the same reasons that people talk about specs. Why wouldn't you aim to get the best possible gear? BiS doesn't mean "you must have this gear to qualify." It just means "this is the best gear there is."
---
I was also a kid and a hunter and could kite forever. It was so fun. Paladins especially had no way to EVER reach you. Not a single ranged attack haha and. You have a 30% movement speed buff. So stupid to think about in retrospect but fun times.
---
As someone who joined at Wotlk, why is this a bad thing?
---
Fury crossover isn't terrible but not having mortal strike means you lose a lot of protection burst, not to mention the debuff it brings.
---
I just checked my private server account, my low level undead has one of those short cloaks on and it doesn't cover up the spine nor the shoulder bones. Not 100% on the longer cloaks, but I would imagine it doesn't
---
Get class leaders who are knowledgeable and you trust. Communicate the expectation to them and let them handle it.  Have players on the bench to take over for those who aren't ready to encourage competition. 
---
If you try to one-man micromanage a vanilla guild you will hate your life.
---
by the time they implemented aoe loot on live it pretty much bacame a neccecity. you could just into a quest zone and pull every mob and aoe them all down like it was diablo. the loot change just happened to adjust for that. in classic it wont be an issue unless maybe in some dungeons,but thats no big deal really
---
Dear god Id be going crazy putting in my vacation ASAP.
---
Yeah I remember it not covering the shoulders, but I don’t remember the back on the longer cloaks.
---
Ret isn't useless, it definitely can be viable. It's just more expensive than other classes and you have to try harder than most.
---
The best games don't hold your hand.
---
Who cares about these people? Especially when complaining about core mechanics. Laugh at them, troll them for being peasants or ignore them.
---
I'd argue that it keeps people in cookie cutter builds and if you compromise you have to explain yourself to your group/raid.
---
I understand. I was just embracing the faction battle. I randomly picked Horde when I first rolled a character and I'm fiercely loyal to that 14-year-old arbitrary choice.
---
If you want to pick a specialization and stick to it, then I'd go priest. Outside of healing, a holy paladin is next to useless. Holy priests can do a bit better, especially if you spec into Searing Light to beef up Smite/Holy Fire and pick up Holy Nova. Priests are squishier than Paladins, so if you're on a PvP server you might find it easier to help out lowbies as a paladin. That said, I'd much rather PvP as a priest because at least you can do *something* besides stand there and heal while the other person wails on you. 
---
Both classes will heal well for dungeons. Priests are more versatile healers in general. And Mind Control is an amazing (and amazingly fun) ability both in PvP and PvE.
---
I'll be done when I get full T3. Everything else is just the steps needed to get there.
---

---
Nope, your spec is part of your identity, if anything it should be harder to change spec.
---
tyvm!
---
dual spec was wotlk. ulduar i believe. maybe trial of the crusader
---
Lol? The reason you don’t see it in other xpacs is because you just spam lfg/lfr and epics are handed to you on a silver platter :)
---
yeah I'll feel like giving up ms in pvp would crush me emotionally lol
---
Dedicated experienced raider looking for a late night EST weekday guild in NA. 1am start time is ideal!  If you're out there hmu
---
Not really sure how you havent heard of if, even back in original Classic wow it was very much a big thing. To many people and myself included the game is about getting the best gear for your character while having fun and enjoying the ride. I wanna know which dungeons to farm, and which items I have to aim for and help my friends get.
---
Also I know im very excited that the warforge and titanforge shit is not a thing in classic, so you actually know WHAT to farm and not just hope and pray to RNG for items you need.
---
Classic isnt like retail, where you have 10 different ways of getting any item slot with the stats you need, in classic you will in many cases just have that 1-2 places to get it, so it is very important to actually know, where you actually get those items.
---
Yeah part of me really wants to roll a hunter such cool flavor. The pets, feeding, arrows, standing still to shoot, dead one, melee weapons, tracking everything, trapping horde on the roads in stv. Was really fun! Aspect of the pack with all the low levels.
---
Yeah, I have a baseline RP in all games even if I'm not playing a full RP character and I really don't like to respec much. I'll level my priest as Holy and my shaman as Elemental.

I never thought about it that way. I love that mindset. Ret pala LFG ! (jk holy for life)
---
This has merit, very good point mister guy.
---
Imp - This is your raid pet.  It provide blood pact for a stamina bonus.  You keep it phase-shifted so that it doesn't do dps or take damage.  If it attacked in raid situations it would die quickly to AE mechanics.
---
Succubus - I use this in pvp if I'm having trouble with rogues.  Warlocks get no stun breaks in Vanilla.  The Warlock PvP trinket has fear, charm and sleep breaks on it.  If you are getting stun locked by a rogue this is your best option (rogues like to wait for warlocks right below the WSG GY).  Another option is to sac your voidwalker and hope to survive the damage from the stun lock rogue. Problem with that is a good rogue will sap you, have a seat, wait for the VW shield and Sap to wear off, then re-engage.  This happened to me and totally nullified my VW shield.
---
Voidwalker - leveling and farming pet.  Also good for fights that have pushback.  Some of the bosses in BWL have a pulsing fire damage that will push back your casting.  Tryhard warlocks will start with a Greater Fire Protection Potion, sac their VW, pop another GFPP - all to keep a shield on them that prevents spell pushback and lowers their dps.
---
Felhunter - great for pvp as stated elsewhere.  I have trouble getting the devour magic to work, but spell lock works like a charm on casters.
---
it was WOTLK btw
---
Took me about fifty runs to get, only mount I have ever tried to actually farm. 
---
Funny thing was, I ended up getting it when I was on vacation hanging with my buddies in another state.
---
We were all drunk and I did the run. Expected not to get it.
---
I fly back home (Arizona) check my inventory and it is fucking there.
---
I swear I got it from the ip mixup from being in another state haha.
---
We did this too and the only problem I remember is guys would horde dkp because they all wanted the same pvp weapon, so none would bid on gear upgrades. We had to assign gear to players and take their dkp and they'd bitch because it'd move them down from dkp leader and thus lose if the PvP item dropped.
---
what bothers me , and has and will always bother me is when people from other races come to westfall to do their quests. now I guess it wouldnt be an issue on retail because of mob tagging but back in the day i got really mad about that. i know that I was in the wrong and that people can quest where they want , i truly do. But I cant helpt but get irrationally mad.
---
Partly true I suppose but hunters will be less popular this time around since everyone knows their Dps starts to fall off in later raids but will still be played for their great soloing/pvp capabilities
---
Is it better to take enchanting or just vendor the drops?
---
While were young!
---
i feel your pain. im gonna do everything i can to stick with 1 character but its gonna be hard for sure
---
&gt;I like the ranking system. It rewards skill but puts time investment at the highest, which is how MMORPG games should work. 
---
Lol no, it doesn't reward skill. It completely punishes anyone who can't put in the time. 
---
You can be the most skilled player in the world but if you can't put in enough time you won't get anywhere.
---
The metric ton of flame whispers you end up getting on a daily basis as a hunter when you are gearing with proper melee weapons. It's like. Ok we get it your guild is bad and you see the weapon you want on a class who only hits the boss with it once every 10 seconds. But it was so annoying... and from what we've seen so far - 14 years later people still don't get it.
---
&gt; shocked that they need to farm them
---
Except they don't. Nobody farmed them in Vanilla and ferals still found their way into raids.
---
Repentance is ok, you could have the same build but 21/0/30. I guess you can get away without it healing,
---
That’s good to hear!
---
&gt; only the option of holding Shift to auto-loot
---
oh wow I thought this was a private server bug... that sucks. i hope they add that option as well.
---
It wasn't terrible. I leveled a UD priest as my alt and I ended up enjoying her more than the mage by the end.
---
So much sass over a bloody video game.

They might be able to ramp sharding in the 1-10s through the roof, but if they stay true to what they’ve said about sharding, then the 10-20 zones are gonna be unplayable by Blizzard standards. 
---
If people expect a dreamworld experience in 1-10 and get a hellscape in 10-20, there will be an influx of complaining, and Blizzard could push sharding even deeper into the game. I mean... I’ll still play, but that’s a huge fuck you to Classic fans if that happens.
---
In a raid environment, min/maxers make up the majority of warriors and rogues.
---
Nearly all raiding dps rogue and warrior only ever talks about their gear and dps. Sounds an awful like min/maxers to me.
---
For me, it's not so much how many warriors and rogues there are, but the fact that they attract a certain type of player who's epeen seems to rise with how well their class scales in raids.
---
When I play Druid and Shaman, I can chat for days with other like minded players and not talk about gear or raid stats at all. It's the players and their lemming charge to flavor of the month classes that defines the meme more than the classes.
---
Sadly 1.12 is forever stuck with warrior as it's fotm. No other class in game has so many players playing it for reasons outside of concept alone.
---
2.0 patch honor system was literally the original welfare epics. I don't think that is a good fit for Classic at all.
---
It’s not valuable for ranking a person considering stats are not scaled based on item level, and things like spell power, intellect, and spirit vary wildly.
---
I heard back in the day it was released earlier in the US to counter the release of Everquest 2 that came out that month
---
I guess they were worried EQ2 would take their cool aid
---
A ton of issues were patched out between the US and EU release though so I'd like to thank the US for beta testing for us
---
As alliance, the enemy faction had Tremor totem and Will of the forsaken. 2 pretty amazing counters to fear. Granted alli has fear ward, but that’s more of a specific situation.
---
I remember my little brother and I shared an account back then, and he was level 4 and I was level 15. I saw Kazzak at Stormwind while he was playing and I kicked him off because "I was a higher level and I could do more damage than a level 4".
---
These are beautiful thank you man! Any way we can get an undead mage somewhere in there?
---
http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/19085562
---
Thanks! Thats super interesting... Sounds like a really fun but time consuming quest line haha
---
You can max out nature resistance for your pet.
---
People followed internet idols around in game, even in vanilla.
---
Of course the people who rolled warrior/rogue/mage specifically to raid will be in raids, I'm not sure I'm following your point.
---
Whether or not this constitutes a large majority of the players in each class, I would say not, which is the original point.
---
These are amazing, if you could do an undead warrior I would be forever in your debt!
---
Pre raid bis as a concept should be taken with a grain of salt for especially healers. For priest the preraid bis is calculated from nonstop spamming of heal rank 2. Very few fights in the game is like that, and no good priest healers play like that, which means the pre raid bis for your specific play style will most likely be different than what can be considered as mathematical correct way of gearing your priest.
---
The result is that +healing  stat is valued too high compared to how actual gameplay is in raids like Molten Core. Spirit and mp5 is given less value than what it is actually worth. Any fights where you do a bit of dispelling makes +healing a more or less a useless stat (ie Lucifron).
---
I like your optimism but even 10 mill is a massive over estimate lol
---
I can promise you that ”everyone” does not know that.
---
Uh....why wouldn't they work? How does that make any sense?
---
Jindos hexxer on my paladin. I did ZG twice a week for around 9 months. Every other paladin in my guild had one. We were too shit and small to do much more than a few bosses in MC, so this would be the best I could get. After about 6 months from the last drop we got one, but some fuckheas priest who joined the guild 2 weeks earlier hit need and won, because raid leader hadn’t changed to master loot. He got benediction a week later. 
---
Never got the item either
---
thanks for your excellent contribution
---
Shorter respawns don't matter because someone camping them will just kill them instantly no matter how fast they respawn.  The best solution I think is to just either make them unkillable like OP suggested or maybe give them a small window of invulnerability when they've just spawned in so people who have been waiting can turn in their quests/ pickup follow up quests.
---
that doesnt stop gearwhoring idiots from being gearwhoring idiots
---
The best way to get this information isn't to ask on Reddit. It's to find a list of the handful of people who got this, and tracking them down onto some far corner of the internet.
---
Well, I think we live in the era where players are easily influenced by famous streamers. If every major streamer (which many have noted they are playing when it comes out) return to the game and start playing in droves, you’ll have all these stream watchers jumping in on the hype.
---
Will we stay around 15 mil? Hell no. But damn it’d be hilarious if Blizzard had many more playing classic than retail.
---
Each to his own.
---
And judging by this post you’ve aged 1 year since then.
---
All I'm sayin'...  
---
\~\_\^
---
I’ve been considering things but I am just curious what people think. I raided with guild that had a dkp system back in the day and it was pretty good.
---
I guess not, but no smart raid leader would ever go based off ilvl in vanilla. There are many situations where items from MC would be better than BWL if better itemized for a spec.
---
Downvoting for lack of evidence
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that will avoid piecing in turn ins and save them for one giant boner inducing turn in chain
---
He's exaggerating. Someone with a full time job who is dedicated to the game in their spare time can comfortably and safely get to rank 10 for the gear. You won't have time for much else besides wow and work though.
---
Rank 11 and beyond is where it starts getting unrealistic for people who have to work.
---
Not familiar with the system myself.  What happens if two people want the same item and both have enough points?

It is already happening. There's people whining about class balance all the time.
---
Only just found your content in the last week! So good I've watched nearly every video you've put out
---
The problem is not that people want to be the best they can be, its that they impose the idea of excruciatingly granular progression on others.
---
No reasonable person would demand you have 100% pre-raid bis before even considering joining a raid, but there are a whole lot of unreasonable people who impose that demand on others.
---
It's the same as retail WoW?? Your guild has a raiding time and everyone logs on.
---
I will be.......when I'm at work waiting to get home to play :(
---
It was well before that. I think more around late WotLK or early Cata.
---
Oh nooo, my meaningless internet karma!!!!!!
---
Get a life.
---
Excuse me sire I think your forgetting warriors. The norm for those crazy fucks is to finish the bis.
---
Retail is different because gear genuinely doesn't matter. People will want to finish their 9/9 t3, and KT weapons, rather than just having the kill under their belt.  
---
I think your mentality would not reflect most classic raiders, no; basing that on the fact private servers aren't dead after 1 year, and that I didn't see any of the top guilds on blackrock just stop once they beat KT.
---
Yeah but I can lie and tell my group I'm resto spec.
---
You are a super special snowflake aren't you?
---
The real challenge is not to find the perfect loot system, because there really isn't one, but to find a group of players, who don't bitch about loot and focus on the long term.
---
That said I think there is a sweet spot between point systems and LC. A transparent database where loot distribution and raid participation is shown over all raids with some kind of point system to support the LC's decisions. And I firmly believe that loot should be predetermined before it drops.
---
You have to teach your Charizard strength and beat the elite 4 with him 50 times, then walk all the way back and move the truck.
---
Because cat and bear aren't supposed to be able to use on hit or manually activated abilities from weapons enchants and trinkets. Shapeshifting over rides the ability.
---
Anyone that demands FULL BiS for MC or ZG... well, it’s tbeir raid, but it’s kind of extreme and elitist.
---
But, having something like a BiS list is helpful, so you know what dungeons you want to run. You might need three pieces from LBRS but nothing from BRD. You could still run BRD for fun, but that’s not what you’d do if you want to make your character more powerful.
---
But for BWL? I’d say at *least* full BiS dungeon gear, since ideally everyone should’ve done MC many times first. Vaelestrasz is HARD, and you don’t want your whole raid to burn through consumables, wiping without good progress, because you took a handful of people in some of the shittier dungeon blues. 
---
So essentially for BWL, if half the team is geared solidly, than you’re doing that core team a disservice by inviting people with much worse gear. If it’s a low-expectations progression run, I’d say do whatever, why not.
---
Spot on. Everyone with warlords after 2 months grinding, that'd be good for the game :\^)
---
Nice to meet another American out here in EU :) 
---
Some questions for you:
---
I plan on playing with friends back home on a West coast server, is the ping really that bad? Like does it make PvP and raids unplayable or just unenjoyable? 
---
Going to try to structure our raid times for late PST, early CET so maybe you’d want to join even!
---
I didn't downvote you, but your numbers are insane.
---
Blizzard does do market research.  They do have people who do things like cost and profit projections.
---
Are you in possession of some special research?  Or are you just making these numbers up?  Because surely, if there was the potential for adding 20 million subs to WoW, don't you think Blizzard would have put more resources into it?  Don't you think that interest would have peaked a lot higher?  There's only 68,000 Subscribers to this sub.
---
I think you are overestimating populations and how long nostalgia can sustain interest.  I'm interested in the game, but at the same time, there was an absurd amount of waiting around in the old WoW; quest drops were crap, people would flake out on you mid-dungeon run and it would take far too long to replace them, no flying mounts, punishing run-backs.  Many of these flaws can be mediated by having good guild mates, but some of them are pretty inherent to the experience.  For some people that's a good thing.
---
But I'm 14 years older than the last time I played, so...I'm not sure I'm going to have as much fun running around killing 100 crocodiles to get three teeth, or getting raped by rogues in 49+ zones, or waiting for the replacement tank to accept the summons only to realize he's hasn't shown up because he got on a griffon to UBRS from Stranglethorn and then went AFK, or dealing with fucking guild drama (so much guild drama, guilds breaking up, key players leaving, guildleader fatigue, failure to meet raid objectives, ninja-looters, etc)
---
I agree with this. Unskilled players are one thing but there are some straight up stupid people that I’ve grouped with. Those are the same groups that’ll bail right before the final boss because of a wipe and completely waste your time.
---
&gt; instead of actually making a really hard dungeon, they just massively increase stats
---
They have made hard dungeons though. They just had to increase the stats from the "standard" versions which are piss easy because nothing does any damage and everything dies instantly if you have gear. I get if you don't like the keystone system though, you can't just beat your head against the same dungeon over and over until you get it. 
---
&gt;and add a time limit (what really makes M+ hard)
---
At really high levels, yeah. But the only thing the timer does on semi-high levels is force you to play the dungeon somewhat "correctly". Like you can't just nullify the abilities of each pack of mobs by ccing all of them and saving cooldowns for every pull, you got to play it as intended, so to speak. It's only when you get really high that you need the big push for speed, going just to the limit of what you can handle. 
---
&gt;And while it isn't technically never ending, for all but a small percentage of the population it effectively is. Again this is Diablo in WoW, a lot of changes in the recent iteration of WoW seem to be largely influenced by Diablo, and are driven primarily to keep you constantly playing, striving for some new minor goal.
---
I agree I think. But as long as each new goal is fun I don't have a problem with that. I enjoy doing dungeons, so being able to do higher and higher difficulties of them is just a positive. And I really think m+ is a bad example of what you are talking about since there isn't even any reward to it, it's just about personal fulfillment pretty much. There is basically no reason to push keys unless you actually enjoy it, it's not like the awful azerite grind. 
---
&gt;Ok, let's be clear, it obviously is content, I was being a bit hyperbolic, it's not new content, or in my opinion meaningful content, again we are just scaling something we already did up to do it again, and again, and again, to me, and albeit only to me it's pointless. An MMO is supposed to be a world we play in, mythic + is way to gamey for me.
---
Fair enough. I don't exactly feel like m+ existing is hindering other new WoW content though. It really is just a small system they have to implement once and then let it run for pretty much the entire expansion, giving something to the players who like it, and not really hurting the players who don't like it. It's not like m+ is stopping them from releasing new dungeons. 
---
&gt;I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with it when it works, but in this case I don't think it does. 
---
I mean it clearly does work, seeing as there are a lot of WoW players who enjoy m+. From what I've seen from the community it's one of the few parts of BfA that is generally very well recieved, and actually keeps a decent chunk of the playerbase playing regularly and without too many complaints about the content itself. 
---
&gt;For what it's worth, in vanilla they weren't all that easy, we had a bitch of a time with them. 
---
I don't remember them being terribly hard the few times I did end game dungeons in vanilla before TBC released (I was very late to 60). And on pservers they were certainly not hard when I did them. Like obviously they were harder than wrath dungeons and stuff like that (BfA heroic/mythic for example). But I would not rank them much higher than an m+10, which is pretty damn easy if you have players who can play the game. 
---
&gt;And I definitely would love them to retune all end game PVE content to actually be difficult again, they are going to regret not doing that immensely.
---
Just looking at myself, and imagining the ideal version of retail WoW for me, yeah. In PvE it would pretty much only be mythic+10 difficulty and higher (or +15 even, tbh), and only mythic raiding. Because that would weed out most bad players and leave me with everyone else who actually tries to be good at the game. 
---
But in reality there are a ton of other people enjoying WoW for various reasons, and I really don't feel justified at taking that away from them. So having different difficulty levels works just fine for me. I stick to the higher difficulties, others to the lower ones, and we don't have to care much about each other. 
---
&gt;Essentially the end game as it was in TBC with a few more dungeons added throughout the run like Magister's Terrace, yes I realize we had two dungeons difficulties then, call me a hypocrite, but I can deal with two. The heroics in TBC were brutal, and gave decent gear, and retained the stratification necessary to preserve content. 
---
I quit the game before reaching 70, so have no idea how that worked unfortunately, but that sounds fine too, don't see why that would make m+ look bad by comparison though?
---
&gt;One of the biggest issues in modern WoW is how quickly people are able to burn through content, and the reason for this is how plentiful and easy to come by gear is. M+ is a particularly disruptive gearing device that basically guarantees every raid tier dies when the next is released, you cannot have a system like this in the game and preserve content progression, players simply gear too quickly weather they are progressing the raid or not. To be fair this was already happening before M+ was added to the game, but if you're goal was to fix this problem, M+ is now a big part of it.
---
That's not a problem with m+, it's a problem with Blizzards gear design. Every major patch they just reset gear for everyone. That affects literally everything in the game, even stuff like world quests. It's really not an m+ problem. I guess there are arguments to be made that +10 gear is too powerful (same as heroic raids), but that's really another discussion as it has nothing to do with the m+ system in itself. 
---
&gt;If it was completely divorced from the gear grind I'd be fine with it, if it were cosmetic only I think that would be awesome. As it stands it's an integral part of the gearing process for pretty much anyone that cares.
---
Granted, I'm only in a shitty mythic raiding guild (still only 4/9). But the only thing we required of our raiders in regards to m+ is doing at least one weekly +10 for the chest. During the first week of a raid tier it's a really good way to gear up, that's true. But is that really any different from how expansions worked in the past? before getting into raiding you would have to gear up in dungeons. Just now it's every raid instead of every expansion, which is maybe annoying, but only a tiny problem. And if you liked TBC heroics, what's so different about this?
---
&gt;Hopefully, I at least addressed most of your questions?
---
Yeah, thanks for the detailed answer. And sorry about the long reply. This is just one of the few things I'm really liking from Blizzard at the moment (along with the raids), so you completely disagreeing with me kind of engages me a bit too much, lol.
---
Point systems are super easily abused. Everyone did it. LC is not just about giving items to people who want them, but you also give them to players who want something else but at the time this upgrade makes more sense. DKP can completely override that, which is a huge pain in the ass to deal with. Not to mention most point systems reward the wrong people all the time by default.
---
Sick mcnasty critz.
---
You now have talent trees back that you can customize how you see fit with tons of options to vary. I’d argue that this is more supportive of hybrids. You can mix and match talent trees how you want, instead of having to pick tank, heals, or dps spec and it autofilling in what talents are available.
---
I remember farming gold pearls from those large turtles at one of the beaches and selling them like hot cakes.
---
On private servers druids are extremely rare since people know what they're getting in the game, and it's not because they don't have a normal rez. If you're in a dungeon you really should just be tanking as a druid anyway, they're arguably the best 5 man tanks and a lot of warriors want to just be fury or arms and never want to tank whether while leveling or at 60.
---
I'm a scatman!
---
Remember when wow had the gear score addon... then remember when blizzard loved it and implimented it the base game?
---
Mmhm, original gen 1 was just a mess of spaghetti code with so many abusable bugs and glitches.
---
Ok, don't join their group and make your own?
---
If everyone else in the group is ok with trying to play optimally, why should they have to bring you along if you're not willing to do the same?
---
Hi, /u/Hydrofluoride
---
Do you guys not have lives?
---
I imagine most guilds will be that way. Everyone talks about what’s viable and what isn’t, but mind you these raids were tuned 15 years ago for people playing at 20 FPS with only half the raid actually knowing what they’re doing lol
---
And some silver is better than 0 silver, so why not roll on literally everything? Just because you can get SOME value out of it doesn't make it any less selfish when someone else can benefit significantly more for it. Selfishness is a bad long-term strategy in a community-driven game. Reputation matters, so don't squander yours.
---
How slow male cows run.
---
I posted from my phone =(
---
Oh absolutely compared to live, but Vanilla didn't really support hybrids.  If it did, you'd actually be able to have for example a Paladin do some DPS, back off to toss out a few heals or cleanse if necessary, hold a mob that got loose from the tank, etc. at all levels.
---
It's not really hybrids when one spec is terrible, and you're shoehorned into one role at endgame; a real hybrid would have had encounters designed around being able to do multiple things during the course of the encounter.
---
This is sick man, great work! How do I get you to do an intro animation for my channel? LOL
---
I'll add the classes I found Hotw and Feral good against (other's success may vary):
---
Mage: You wreck them. There are many good mages and very few great druids. Get good and mages are easy. Both Hotw and pure feral are good against them.
---
Rogues: Once you get this fight down and have the opener, you will win. Worst case is just kite troll them. Both hotw and feral are great but feral must be absolutely perfect game play.
---
Warriors: As long as they have no healing support and their gear is within your range, you will wreck them. Pure feral has a harder time. The dots and better heals helps immensely for Hotw which is why you hybrid to it. Feral is too dedicated.
---
Hunter: God damn this can vary. Druids have tools to counter hunters. Hunters have tools to counter Druids. If you perfectly exploit them, they are easy. You use your kiting and cc to counter their kiting and cc. Odd fight. Fun fight. Frustrating as fck fight against good hunters. Great hunters will teach you have well you know how to play as they tend to do with many classes who underestimate them.
---
Warlocks and Priests: I put those together because both are either not worth engaging, are easier to engage in team pvp over solo (you'll be feared and running all over the place with dots on) friendly only if specifically geared and prepared for them. Some may have mastered these 2 classes but I always struggled with them a little unless they are distracted by other engagements.
---
Paladin: This can be a very fun or annoying fight depending on your view. Luckily you are one of the few classes that can actually kite them. Prepare to kill one Paladin multiple times. Your improved mana levels with Hotw gear helps a lot over pure feral.
---
Orc anything: Pay close attention to the fact that your stuns may be resisted. Stuns are still a big part of your game play for feral or hybrids.
---
Shamans: Hope that they are Enhancement and you can cc/kite. I haven't figured out Elementals yet. They hurt, oh God, they hurt. half your health will vanish before they really do anything yet.
---
&gt; So essentially for BWL, if half the team is geared solidly, than you’re doing that core team a disservice by inviting people with much worse gear. If it’s a low-expectations Pug progression run, I’d say do whatever, why not.
---
I wasn't implying that gear wasn't important. It absolutely is. Gear comes naturally as a consequence of raiding. You also want your character to have as good gear as possible at any given time. The thing I was concerned about was the binary mentality of "either it's BiS or it's useless". From what I remember, you rarely get to choose which exact pieces you'll get and absolute BiS lists don't help comparing items.
---
I fully agree, but people don't always show up and people want to be treated fairly. Distributing loot based on participation and engagement is much better for long term stability.
---
Individual performance should be handled within the guild by sharing knowledge and practicing together and not by loot distribution.
---
If hunter A is always performing significantly better (not just a few % points) than hunter B and they have similar participation, then it is on the officers and on those two hunters to find a way to improve hunter B.
---
Your mentally is not suitable for an MMO.
---
I think our servers first Atiesh came mid-late TBC.  There was a group of us from a couple of hardcore guilds that started running Naxx regularly between our normal Guild raid-nights.
---
Never said it was new, but I do think it'll be on a different level.
---
what class? and why?
---
I would say sometimes unenjoyable, never unplayable. But I'm super used to it as this point. It's a lot more forgiving than fps games. That sounds great. :)
---
I played in Vanilla and I only got 3 DHKS. 1 by accident when I didn't know what it meant to kill a Civilian. And two from PUG x-road raids.
---
I never got any DHKs in Guild or privately organised World PVP raids. It's pretty simple - don't be a bad and aggro the civilians. It isn't difficult.
---
Debuff limit. I wish everyone could use all their abilities in raids :(
---
I tried for so dang long to get a full shadowcraft set and it was heartbreaking to run so many dungeons with the gear so rarely dropping.
---
Deathknight?
---
These are great. Thanks.
---
Oh wow, ok...
---
So finding a group of like-minded people is not allowed in MMOs now?
---
I played a protection warrior in classic and leveled a mage to farm. If you want to play a class that can't farm, you pay the piper.
---
Man some specs were just trash. Any non warrior tank, non priest healer, and hybrid DPS were garbage for dungeons/raids. Thats not a cool system.
---
BLUE!
---
Where did you find this?
---
The "YOU FUCKING NOOB" frame sticks in my head everytime someone ninja pulls
---
If I'm incorrect then so be it. Never really played alliance, but it would be kind of a dick move to need on hoj vs a rogue or war who needs it.
---
Grrr goons, hat goons.
---
This video introduced me to The Misfits way back when. Huge Misfits and Danzig fan now.
---
Slight difference between not everything going perfect and full red gear.
---
OLD AND BLUE!
---
When/what was the patch that made it so you can see the text/numbers of how much you healed someone over that npc/person's character?
---
&gt;terrible model
---
bitch what
---
Oh right, I didn't thought about the 2 hour fact and the time needed to switch zones. My bad then.
---
Say you're the sort who plays 18 hours a day and you get to level 60 in the first week and you've got all the best quest gear you could solo. Good for you. Now what?
---
Your mentality prevents you from running anything, that's what.
---
You can't do any instances with people who haven't put in all that same effort and got all that same quest gear otherwise you will be forced to acknowledge that your mentality is wrong.
---
But let's say by some miracle you've got a group of people who did the same as you. Neat! Now what? Well now you get to do elite quests and instances, comfortable on the knowledge that your mentality is intact and that you're no hypocrite.
---
So you and your 4 buddies farm up all the bis in the world, knowing that none of you will move on until all of you are 100% bis.
---
Then what?
---
Well by then everyone else will be in BWL and even the filthy casuals will have ZG on farm... Despite not having completely stacked bis.
---
So enjoy your solo life in wow while the rest of us play it as an MMO.
---
Take my gold, take it all the way to the frontpage.
---
If anyone wants to make this I volunteer my vocal contributions to the project. I've been in literally nothing but I can do an Ork, Dwarf, Troll, Tauren, and possibly a gnome voice. You can dig deep into my profile for a soundcloud link of when I did Ork VO requests a while back but I don't want to post the page in case it breaks a rule.
---
Does it offer decent survivability to 1 vs 2 opponents?
---
I agree, I initially went fury because it seemed like it might be better for when I needed to tank before I went to prot (MT quit). I got untamed blade right after and started doing great two hand fury damage and most of the warriors in my guild switched fury because of it. This was right after they reworked fury, and my experimentation with a hybrid spec I made out of a desire to not respec as often made me do it.
---
50g respec cost...
---
I can assure you BiS lists were a thing in Vanilla and onward. They might not have been as widespread but I had one for our hunters (I was the class officer till end of AQ40 when I joined a new guild) for most raid tiers. 
---
People weren't expected to assemble full BiS before moving on, it was just a list so they had a quick way to check which items were upgrades or not.
---
Sage
---
You are assigning conditions to your statement retroactively, pal. Kick it back a notch.
---
That's some quality work right there. Though I wish more of them were actually from Classic and not TBC or Cata. Might I suggest Raggi, Nefarian, Cthun or KT?
---
Go click the link in the first post in this thread.
---
It was possible but you had to have a computer that could actually load fast enough
---
I am only doing this once, and only here. I know an individual who was part of item implementation  for classic. He has informed me their is a hidden quest for Corrupted Ashbringer, that can only be found once you wield it.
---
I dunno how I feel about this.  On one hand stuff like this is Epic and should be in the game.  On the other hand, having him raid Stormwind several times a week will get old quick, especially when the downtime will be filled by the green dragon in Darkshire.
---
I'm really confused as to where this sentiment that everyone needs to be in full BiS gear to raid even comes from. The list is just something you can work towards and I have yet to see anyone claim that you need full BiS gear to start raiding.
---
Hydraxian Waterlords
---
Nice! I too plan on leveling my priest as Holy, at the very least until 45. I'm curious if Elem is actually better for leveling on a PVP server since elem is the superior pvp spec or if that doesn't really come to fruition until 60/post 40?
---
Rogues are a viable option as combat bridges the gap well between pve and pvp but you are going to make sacrifices whatever you choose unless you want to pay to respec every week.
---
Only the top 20% will do that, there will be meme guilds out there who can make it basicly up to twin emps raid wise, that about when it gets actually tuff and people need to play none meme for long term viability.
---
I always thought Rogues were the majority. I think I'll make a Priest or a Mage
---
Gnomer and ST are probably more even. I would say horde have more of an edge for scholo/strat. That flight always feels like an eternity as alliance.
---
No one can predict what people will be rolling. We can make assumptions based on what we know about the game but that's it. I've seen people say there will be millions of hunters and warlocks because they are one of the best leveling classes. I also see people say that there will be only a few hunters because they're not top tier in raids, and that Alliance won't have many warlocks because of Horde racials. I see people say that there will be countless warriors, but also that warrior leveling is hard and most people won't stick with it. Geez, there's only 8 classes per faction. Expect to see a lot of many of them and **just play what you want to play**. Don't forget that some people only want to PVP, some live for raids, some only like to do 5 man dungeons, some like to do WPVP, some like to fuck around and explore, and some like to do a mix of content.  There will be slots for you.
---
Doubtful. The level designers just worked extremely far in advance. [Long interview with John Staats, one of the main guys on the dungeon design team - creator of BRD/BRS/AQ/etc](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D2jeTaX952A). The next episode in that series is #13, has him on again as well as Mark Kern. Try both if you're really curious.
---
He mentions that they worked years in advance of the encounter/lore people and often made empty rooms that they handed off to be populated. Also they always knew they would have expansions even before launch (Diablo given as an example of proving the model worked), and lots of stuff was earmarked for "we'll do this in the expansion."
---
For example, that version of Hellfire Peninsula that you can get to by glitching out of deadmines? Yea, it was always going to be TBC. It's there because the guy designing it needed to test/view his work.
---
Sorry my cat ran away glhf
---
Uh some of the graphics, namely the thrall one, look straight ripped off from the Hearthstone cinematic...
---
https://youtu.be/QdXl3QtutQI
---
Care to explain?
---
What do you mean you never fight them?
---
&gt; way behind to boot.
---
Oh no!  Maybe I won't be clearing Naxx by the next expansion at this rate!  Oh, wait.
---
Yeah this sort of thing can end up being a whole evening event for a server which is always amazing, DHKs stifle that fun so hard
---
Are the dungeon sets at 60 not good enough to raid in? I looked at some of the BiS lists and I dont see many dungeon set peices.
---
Blizz still hasn't fixed the clipping on my transmog!
---
If you are horde you don't fight undead in wpvp and battlegrounds.
---
Weakauras!
---
&gt;A lot of people think DKP rigs the system in favor of longterm raiders, but it's literally a system that pays off the dedication of those people.
---
It can, but not if you reset dkp with raid tiers.
---
The crazy number of consumables you need to raid. Potions being able to stack is annoying as well. Also I think I remember black lotus being pretty rare so flasks will be a bitch.
---
Never stated you were the one who downvoted me....nor did I ever have any form of market research, just spitballing here.
---
Anyway, if popular streamers return to the game in droves we’ll have many new players that have never experienced WoW Classic, but keep hearing about it from the idiots like us that live off of nostalgia. They try it out, and due to the utter overhauls of MMOs in the past 15 years, it’s like no other MMO they have ever played. Communities are alive, rather than seeing a player run by and not giving a flying shit about what they are doing, they are invited to groups and depended on. They have to invest time into getting gear, rather than getting awarded a purple after their first quest in the game. They get hooked (yes, people still get hooked to this game 14 years later.)
---
Next thing we know, we have a bunch of kids who are 10-22 years old that never had the chance to play Classic WoW, playing it for their first times. On top of that, we have veterans returning, and retail players ~3 mil playing.
---
Why didn’t these kids play WoW in the past at any expansion? With such a late start, they started in empty starting zones, massive leveling fear (1-110), and Classic players complaining about how the game is shit now. They’re now starting with everyone. They are equal. No more catching up, they get to start at a level playing field.
---
Your point for market research: Blizzard has said adamantly that they do not want to support two games. Their execs for crying out loud have told fans off and to shut up about it. A couple extra mil doesn’t change the opinions of execs, rather a couple hundred mil does. Clearly their market research team finally told them to STFU and bring back Classic. There is a huge want for this game, it’s going to surprise the shit out of everyone in the industry and gaming communities.
---
If I’m all in the hype, set a reminder for a year and I’ll eat the crow.
---
Obviously you take anything that's an upgrade. BiS just gives you an idea of what is actually best when it gets a little nebulous
---
THICC

TSM - Trade Skill Master
---
His mentality is perfect for an MMO. If a group of people don't play how you want to play then just don't play with that group of people.
---
Ravenholdt is easy just time consuming. Shendralar will, as always be a huge pain in the ass.
---
Classic will be closer to pservers than it is to vanilla in terms of everything except server pop
---
Couldn't agree more regarding Devil's Tower as TB. When I saw it in person a few years back I could hear the music in my head almost the entire time there
---
His mentality is unrealistic in that it expects perfection from all players at all levels.
---
Good old Illidrama.
---
I got the image online, might have been a press release image? However the movement and effects are all done within wallpaper engine. I realized earlier that what I meant by “made” might have missed the mark. I tried to clarify a little bit before the second image by stating that they were reimaginings of the original image but I think that may not be very clear. Right before you said something I actually edited in a blanket “I did not make the images but the effects” statement for this reason.
---
easiest to gear in raids? resto shamans, warlocks, or hunters?
---
RIP decursive...
---
Curious about your comment on Shamans. Are there any guides that help explain what their optimal support looks like? I realize a lot of it is probably a situational understanding of what totem to drop when, who and when to purge, when to blow someone up, and when to heal your team, but something that dives into that more could be great!
---
Sometimes I wonder if a large part of reddit has some kind of reading disability.
---
Ha, continue where you left off....
---
Think those players would be banned if that happened today?
---
I can’t believe you leveled three characters to mid-30s+ before getting one max level.
---
That is....peak indecision
---
Well, you have to consider that you have to enchant your gear too. Many enchants are hella expensive, so a lot of times people want to be sure *their own* gear is at a spot where it won’t be replaced in the near future. And if it does get replaced, it’s so much better that it’s worth buying another enchant. 
---
Again, I don’t think raid leaders should indiscriminately require the absolute BiS. But, while there are many blues that will substitute as pre-BiS, there are also many that are *bad*. 
---
Like... If someone was in full t0 mage armor... they’re probably not coming to a BWL run. It looks cool, but it’s not good. I’d like to reiterate that requiring full BiS is stupid, but at the end of the day, it’s the raid leaders choice.
---
Another thing is, raid gear is hard to acquire and amass, because it has a lockout. If you can get full BiS, or at least close to it, than you should, since absolutely nothing is stopping the character from getting stronger. 
---
But TLDR, I agree the BiS or useless mentality is aweful, but I really don’t see it that much. Honestly, I’ve gotten into mc and ZG with quite a few aweful pieces without a hitch. I’ve also been told no, when I had bad gear. Different groups for different troops :)
---
What makes their rep worth grinding?
---
Dem shoulder pads ooowee
---
I’ve played since vanilla, raided in vanilla (yes, naxx) and I had never heard of that necklace. Interesting.
---
Google it
---
Shamans are amazing in raids as healers, and paladins arguebly outheal priests in raw healing, what are you talking about.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply. One more q if you don't mind: as a freshly dinged 60 hoping to tank/DPS/heal 5/10 mans and MAYBE heal the odd MC/Ony raid to gear up for PVP, what are the pros and cons of HOTW vs 29/11/11?
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/14996569538  October 2014
---
Should do bloodmyst/azuremyst - those 2 zones got me from 59-62. That was before the most recent leveling changes though. Nice quest density, small zone (designed for running players not mounted), quest pick ups are mostly from the two camps so you don't have to go looking around.
---
The most victorious moment was when my ragtag guild downed rag. We were composed of a lot of my rl friends aged ~14 and other small groups of friends.
---
Probably, but no says you can't raid in blues, of course you can.  
---
What people do say is, if you aren't aiming/building your pre-bis, you're not taking raiding seriously and 'my elite guild' does not want you.  
---
It's not a hard concept, and its something that all people who want to do the bare minimum to raid whinge about. But surely they can see the rationale in that decision.   
---
You can spend your entire week in your generic blues doing MC, while top guilds who have aimed for BiS gear will do it in far less, because that's where the dedication pays off.
---
&gt;The Misfits
---
Fourth comment on the [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/4WoxLk2g4-w). I've always said: fuck all the whiners. This chick was lucky. She's connected to a pretty major meme.
---
You have 40 raid slots to fill. Hunter armor and weapons drop regardless of whether they are in the group or not. 
---
An entire dps roster of mages and fury warriors may be higher on paper, but hearing that gaggle of folks in the exact items will take forever. 
---
Diversifying your dps will lead to higher dps in practice.
---
Dude wtf are you even talking about?
---
\&gt; You can't do any instances with people who haven't put in all that same effort and got all that same quest gear otherwise you will be forced to acknowledge that your mentality is wrong.
---
No one gives a shit what sort of gear you have for 5 mans, not even the most hardcore players. When people talk about min/maxing, BiS lists, etc, that's usually only related to 40 man raids and maybe some pro level pvp.
---
\&gt;  But let's say by some miracle you've got a group of people who did the same as you. Neat! Now what? Well now you get to do elite quests and instances, comfortable on the knowledge that your mentality is intact and that you're no hypocrite. 
---
That's what a lot of people actually do. Instead of spamming trade chat for 2 hours in search of a group, people try to form friendships/guilds and do all those things with people they know.
---
 \&gt; So you and your 4 buddies farm up all the bis in the world 
---
No one in their right mind will expect anyone to do that. All the [pre raid BiS lists](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j81TgG0p_HrYKajiUiQfYIoSUx1culzy2u_Fc4wtiS8/edit#gid=0) have multiple weaker options if you for some reason cannot get the actual BiS for w/e equipment slot.
---
\&gt;  Well by then everyone else will be in BWL and even the filthy casuals will have ZG on farm... Despite not having completely stacked bis. 
---
Uhh, the whole point of trying to play with other "min/maxers" is to be amongst the first people to clear all those raids.
---
If you're still farming pre raid BiS while casuals have ZG/BWL on farm, you're doing something HORRIBLY wrong...
---
\&gt;  So enjoy your solo life in wow while the rest of us play it as an MMO 
---
Try not to worry so much about how other people enjoy playing the game and maybe do some actual research before spewing a bunch of made up bullshit...
---
It appears that you need to do their quests to unlock molten core raid thank you guys!
---
Well I don't really know where the Classic server is starting off at but... You needed 7 people with revered to get 7 Aqual Quintessence items which were used to douse the runes after each boss. After dousing all 7, Major Domo would spawn.
---
COmpetitively in raids, it doesn't support hybrids, but outside it does. As a paladin for example, you can heal raids and tank/heal dungeons with the same spec. That's pretty hybrid to me.
---
Well I hope to see you in there.  But I can't guarantee I'll stay.  It's gonna come down to the community, and if we get a good guild community I'll be happy.
---
Damn that's so crazy. I could have sworn I'd played at least Cata with OC servers.
---
Resto Shaman. Gearing a Tank or Healer is always faster/easier than gearing DPS, mainly due to how much faster they can get invited to groups.
---
You’ll have ony almost instantly after hitting 60 and getting some not shit gear. Rag might take a bit depending how good the raid group is.
---
i don't think so
---
&gt; Waiting hours to get into BGs
---
Not if cross-realm are a thing.
---
TIL I'm an old timer
---
TBC Season 1 Warlord's/Marshal's gear wasn't exactly great. It provided its main use through resilience for use in the arena and it wasn't exactly useful in PvE situations. Compare that to how powerful the PvP gear in vanilla is and there is a massive difference on their impact on the game.
---
Oh so you now admit that your idea of 100%BISORDIE is completely fubar? Cool. My work here is done.
---
Um, no. You can use on use abilites on gear. That isn't a private server bug LMAO. Stop spreading misinformation about things you do not understand clearly
---
"My way is the only allowed way to enjoy the game"
---
So I called it ‘no cakewalk’ and you refer to it as ‘only having time to work and play wow’. I don’t know how your world works but that doesn’t sound like a cakewalk to me.
---
Mage scales horribly with gear.
---
I liked seeing this in Stranglethorn, especially after the incessant ganking that it took to get a quest log full of completes.
---
Triviabot
---
Agreed, I might actually buy wallpaper engine if these were available.
---
Where did I ever say that I expect "perfection"?
---
Yeah.. no you can't.  Druids whined about that constantly.
---
Warriors and Warlocks scale the most. 
---
Frost Mages and Hunters the least.
---
Somebody want to give me some context
---
I expect WoW forums to be flooded with druids, shaman and palies who want to dps or tank.
---
