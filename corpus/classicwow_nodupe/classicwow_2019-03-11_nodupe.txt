This speaks to me!

---
---
Good to know about that with Owls, thanks.
---

---
Wouldn't cat vs wolf depend on the group composition though? For an all physical party, having 6 times 50 extra damage every 10 seconds surly amounts to more than claw. At a minimum it's the best thing for a raid to have a wolf in the tank's party.
---
Just imagine a LFD run requiring the group to communicate and CC!  Now that is an evil thought.
---
&gt; To hell with low raid DPS,
---
This is a myth, hunters are tier 1 dps in MC/BWL and around 50% of the fights in AQ/Naxx, mainly the ones without adds. Do not listen to private server kids about how hunters, most of them  never played retail vanilla at a high level. 
---
Downvoted for secrecy 
---
No, it doesn't. It's a picture. This isn't Harry Potter. Pictures don't speak.
---
I totally understand, I hope this helps you though!
---
Really wish the original timer was doubled. I could not break my pally past 20, so damn boring/annoying
---
This is mildly related but I thought I'd toss it in.  
---
My first night ever doing BWL was with the best guild on the server because they were taking trials and one of them asked me if I wanted to go. I said sure. Never had stepped foot in BWL before and was super nervous. I was constantly talking to my friend in the guild via whispers because I was so dreadfully nervous.  
---
So in game I would type enter &gt; /r to reply to people, because I had "R" bound to a spell. Which spell was R bound to?  
---
Oh none other than Blink. In my fit of whisper barrages to my friend, I accidentally just pressed R by itself. We were standing near the pull for Razorgore, where the orcs sit on the control platform. I blinked forward and agro'd the orcs, which starts the encounter. The raid wasn't ready. They tried their hardest to do the encounter but ultimately wiped. I got my ass chewed by every officer but surprisingly was NOT kicked from the raid.  
---
What did I do when we came back in? Yeah. Accidentally blinked again, BUT this time I was standing so far back that I didn't agro the orcs, but my heart was pounding out of my chest. Needless to say I faced my character a different direction after that. Did I rebind blink? Nope... it's still R to this day lol  
---
Spoiler: I didn't get an invite to the guild. My PC and internet were so bad, I couldn't actually see anything happening during the encounter until all the adds ran away and left just the boss.  
---
Man, for some reason this brought back memories of the first time I took the Zeppelin from Org to Grom'gol. One of those early 'holy shit this game is unreal' moments. 
---
Generally if you dont want to be engorged with hardcore players—start leveling 2-3 days after launch, or just take your time in general. Most hardcore players only do a select few dungeons once while they are leveling to 60. If they are hardcore and running dungeons for bis gear while leveling, they are just twerps. You are going to run into assholes in any given sect of the playerbase. 
---
Generally most players are more than willing to educate you on “what the best spec is for your current goals and are ready to spread their expertise, but unless you’re repeatedly pulling aggeo, pulling packs, most people will happily out dps your non optimized build and secretly pat themself on the back for doing so.
---
oh mb missread, none really uses post raid lists at all idk why he even listed it.
---
I've yet to hear a single person pronounce Anathema correctly.

Launch cata dungeons were great and the community is just awful for ruining them.
---
GG ghostcrawler, trying to tell people in a blog to try playing better.
---
Oh buddy, let me tell you. As possibly the first Horde player on my server to get it back Vanilla, let me tell you it most assuredly was not worth the grind for anything other than showing off outside Org. The uptime on the summon was short and he would often delay spell casts so he would sit there doing nothing while looking all spooky. Also, it was super weak, so if you summoned it during a fight it would be cleaved down or multishotted in a snap.
---
As I’ve said before in this sub, the best thing is that when you finish the quest line to get the trinket, Thrall does one of those shouts like when Onyxia or Nef dies except he talks about what a good friend you are and how we should all aspire to be like me.
---
Immediately after Thrall shouted I had a bunch of people PM me asking “what did you do what the hell is going on?”. Good times.
---
Spoiler Alert: You still pay almost the entire same gold buying the ingredients for the ritual.
---
WHAT!? That one is soooo easy. Kids these days.
---
Dun Morogh is very often mispronounced. The devs even mispronounced it during the Classic panel.  
---
Cats, wolves and wind serpents are good for PvE. I'm not sure about the maths for the wolf's howl buff, depends what you need, but you rarely will have uptime on all six of you, the range of the buff is very small. Wind serpent is good in that its positioning is easier to manage, you can put it in stay outside of melee range and just use Lightning breath if necessary, and it ignores armor. 
---
For leveling probably owl, cat or boar. Boar is very good, the charge causes a lot of threat and will give you more uptime on Bestial Wrath (and quicker Intimidation) in wpvp, plus it eats anything including mage food. Cat has better damage though, and stealth. Owl is good for farming mobs, one by one or in small packs.
---
For PvP, fast attacking pet (ideally a cat for stealth so Broken Tooth is ideal, other cats can do pretty good too, with ZG you can also get a bat), boar for the charge root, scorpid if you really need to kill that unkillable paladin, wind serpent for good damage uptime and easier management.
---
The game has to be subtly different. Vanilla still needs to be its own thing over classic imo. 
---
Classic needs the same core gameplay just with a 2019 community. It’ll be different but great in its own way man, don’t stress. 
---
&gt; and I spend 5:29 killing neutral F mobs that everyone ignores for 8 levels.
---
All the neutral mobs in the 12-20 zone are pretty ineffective for grinding
---
The boars in Loch Modan and Westfall are standard valued beasts, with competition in both zones for intestines/snouts, and they have a charge ability, which may work differently on pservers than it will in classic, that results in extra damage taken.
---
The crawlers in Darkshore and Westfall are high-armored mobs, they're surrounded by murlocs in Westfall and there's a slight competition for Crawler Legs/Fine Crab Chunks
---
I'm having a hard time understanding why you just wouldn't compete with other players for quest mobs since you have Judgement, one of the best tagging abilities in the game.
---
Unless I'm missing some mob in either of these 3 zones but these are the only neutral ones I could think of.
---
the reason why this whole debate is so heated is because 2 opposing factions formed on the matter.  
---
If someone says something you strongly believe is wrong, you might react quite harsh. People running around advocating class and spec diversity, which would be a nice thing to see, but kinda skip over the problems that certain specs have.  
---
Others are offended by that, claiming that only certain classes / specs are viable for competetive raiding, accusing the former faction of falsly advertising meme specs and spreading wrong information  
---
The truth is somewhere in the middle.  
---
Ret isn't bad, but there are better DPS. Support is nice, but AFAIK they offer nothing else compared to holy palas, therefore taking every paladin as a holy and inviting a superior dps is a "logical" move.  
---
In the end, as long as the dungeons and raids get cleared without too much hassle, I wouldn't give a damn about anything. But 40 players in a raid, investing time, gold and energy, just too fail and fail because a couple of underperfoming specs are present will result in a lot of tension.  
---
And because classic is just...let's call it simple, you can't make up much with skill as well.   
---
That's why I'm constantly saying we need some balancing in classic, because it was kinda bad. But #nochangers will instantly karma bomb you when you want to change something for whatever reason.
---
No. 
---
I prefer yolomance.
---
And I just flashed back to DnT's front page with the massive bold headline, "Ghostcrawler can eat a bag of dicks."
---
All definitions are "made up"; it just matters which ones are used/accepted by a large number of people. I'm cool if my definition is not 100%. I don't need to waste my time nitpicking. If you're right, then just delete "or even 0" from my comment in question, and the rest is fine. 
---
Yep, I'm playing the game for ME, I plan on leveling and playing a ret paladin, if people don't like that oh well, I know a ton of other people are going to play what they want, feral druid, enhancement shaman, ret paladin, play whatever you want and enjoy it!
---
This stuff is in one of Frost's videos, with like several 10s of thousands of views, its not secret. Anyone thinking it will be camped to hell need to remember Classic servers arent going to have Nost/LH levels of population, and the sheer effort of getting a level 1 alt all the way up to the imp, with all the corpse runs is deterrent enough.
---
I mean, Moonkin is not much better.

does that mean that hunters need to walk around following people with their group buffs?

20% increase to pet focus regeneration at 2/2.

I might raise a stink if it causes a loot imbalance in rolling, say a paladin is tanking SM Cath. other 4 are priest-mage-warlock-rogue. The pally gets by default, the legs, the mace, the shield, sm mail pieces, he then gets to roll on the cloth head and necklace if his mainspec is healing or he lacks a neckpiece with mana for tanking spells. I just reapectfully decline those 5 mans as its a bad setup if the paladin doesnt agree to stay on his side of the loot table. I would want some similar protection when raiding so you dont end up with warriors taking leather then getting the p8 defaulted to them, or a hunter rolling on an offhand that a rogue needs, but the rogue can't challenge his range weapon rolls. Mages rolling on daggers that a priest might need when azuresong exists also an example.

There's your first 30 points. You'll be running SoC 99% of them time, and judging is a waste of mana, so no Benediction, no Imp Judgement, and no Imp SotC since leveling fights don't last long enough to matter. The rest of the picks just up your passive dps. Start prioritizing agi gear as you are putting points into Vengeance. 
---
Warriors have access to the Dark Iron plate set without needing random drops. Druids will have a much harder time getting an equal amount of fire resist to tank with.

Worst part was finding out the succubus and felhunter names. Rerolling at 10 wasn't terrible, but late 30-40s? /wrist

Leveling in vanilla takes a lot longer than current retail. You’re looking at around 10 days of in game play time. 
---
Doesn't matter if they punch faster if you still end up taking less damage overall.

If we take Shaman as portmanteau of Sham and Man, the plural would be Shamen.

---
Spirit is mostly fine, it's drastically underrated for the classes that can leverage it, and it's no the end  of the world that it's not as relevant a stat for wars and rogues, after all str doesn't do much for priests and mages.
---
The one really glaring hole with spirit is how bad it is for paladins and shaman. These classes really don't have the tools to work with the 5 second rule the way priests and druids do, and lack talents like Meditation and Spiritual Attunement that interact with Spirit. Some talents for paladins and shaman to interact with spirit could help.
---
Right Anthem is basically the nail in the coffin for Bioware I think (unless SWTOR is doing better than I think).

- Judge on cooldown (2x per fight) does more damage than Blessing of Might (even imp) gives. Especially when you have 2 stuns per minute.

- Blessing of Wisdom allows you to judge on cooldown when specced into Benediction / imp Judge.

- So wisdom &gt; might

Get Repentance for an extra double damage Judge once a minute.

Have you thought about a 2H fury spec? They're raid viable and you can still have fun in PVP because deep wounds + impale hits casters like a truck.

F that quest. Full on F it

I completely forgot about this completely forgettable game :)
---
Not stupid but there are a lot of that people that say then why not just BC, but I really think they miss the point of staying in the classic feel not changing mechanics and spells.
---
What's are typical spec for tanking? Hoping mine lands through same
---
I think this is a really even-headed response to the debate.  Thanks for typing this out.  I did not raid in classic, so I admit that I don't have a clear understanding of how difficult the raids were and how likely a wipe would be with some less-than-optimized specs participating.  I understand stakes are high with that many players and all that they are investing.  For what it's worth, I would be in favor of some kind of balancing as well (and I say this as someone who would probably benefit from #nochange as I plan on playing a mage).  I like that TBC made more specs "viable" in raids.  But that wasn't really the purpose of this thread and I certainly am not looking to pick fights with #nochangers at the moment.  I also think it's not really worth fighting about that because ultimately we will get what Blizzard gives us.  Our only choice will be how we view "less-optimized" specs and how welcoming or exclusive we decide to be.

Fights over ~30 seconds only. Most fights while leveling are ~15 seconds.

Bear form was only 60% armor and Dire Bear was 180%. 
---
The only decent pvp spec was 9/11/31. 
---
The balance tree was weird. There was a talent that increased damage with weapons by 10% and Omen only worked in caster. 
---
It is correct information, you're just arguing semantics. We are discussing PvE specifically. In PvE, Berserking does not have any practical benefits for any of your spells other than Mind Flay. There aren't any fights in the game where you need to get a cast off in 1.35 seconds instead of 1.5 
---
And don't say it helps on add fights to burn down adds more quickly. If a raid leader is telling a *Shadow Priest* to switch to high priority targets that need to die quickly, then there is something seriously wrong with that raid leader.
---
Always thought Shah-men was US and Shay-mun was UK. 
---
Yeah I know now... back then I called it Ouch-in-down. One of the few times I was wildly wrong. It doesn't happen often.
---
I no-lifed Vanilla for almost the entirety of retail Vanilla. I had the first Troll on our server to ever get an interracial mount, and in the first 3 server wide. I was in one of the two largest and most hardcore raiding guilds on the server.
---
....never had more than 100g on me for long. Mostly because I was a complete noob like most people.
---
Now when I ding 60, I've usually got ~300g on me not counting any AH play.
---
I think it's best we don't speak about these things much. Don't want inflation. Just don't bring it up as much as possible.
---
It's free. You get a quest from your class trainer to travel to the warlocks in ratchet and they reward you with the spell. It got changed in BC.

---
Stupid idea because there is a post about this every single day. I love Vanilla, truly. But BC and Wrath were my favorite versions of the game. Provide others with their favorite versions first and THEN consider adding content. For now we haven't even gotten Vanilla yet so let's get that and enjoy that first

You don't take your clothes off while grinding CC rep?
---
People also say "herth" instead of "harth" (hearth), and "reegent" instead of "re-agent" (reagent).
---
The second ones are the correct pronunciations.
---
Not sure what semantics you're referring to, but we both agree on 2 things: zerking reduces mindblast to 1.35, and reduces mindflay. As far as dps in pve, zerking is not amazing. But for the other 90% of priests, 20% haste on healing is very impactful in a pinch. On top of that, in pvp which is the main topic I'm addressing (may be tangentially here) it's super conducive. Even if just a 1.35 mind blast and not considering the benefits of a hasted MF, that's a marginal difference that does help you get an edge on opponents whether it's throwing off their kick, counter spell, shield bash, iron grenade, etc, or even allowing you to get that bit of movement in sooner- in classic you could run about 0.1 second before your cast was over (is this due to spell batching I wonder?) and still complete the cast.

Vanilla wow is a 10 year old themepark mmo.  Everquest is simply a deeper game, also Blizzard is not content with "thousands of players" which I doubt is an accurate number anyway.  
---
False. I play on pservers and play rogue. There are tons of rogues on pservers. Please don't group every pserver player into the same group.
---
&gt;That said, if you know where they will spawn, warlocks can make their voidwalker stand right on the spawn point and set them to aggressive, so as soon as the mob spawns, they vw will tap them, so they're not as bad as some classes.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
voidwalker on aggressive will tap a mob faster than humanily possible by any other classes and in my experience typically beats out a hunter pet for some reason.
---
I think the downvotes have a little more to do with your shit attitude my guy.  Relax 
---
I have been a pretty big user of Judgement of the Crusader in both leveling and PvP, but I'm starting to think that SotC as an ability is pretty damn useless and maybe I should just not have it on my bars even
---
I disagree on that one... but I don't play horde. Teldrassil or bust.
---
thanks for the input. this was very helpful!
---
You seem to be emotionally attached to this racial. I don't have an opinion on Berserking in general. I don't know whether it's good or bad in those other situations you're adding to the mix. All I did was point out that it's not good for Shadow Priests in PvE.
---
Ohgrimmar. 
---
Lets just make it vanilla but better! We can remove debuff slot limit, make hunter pets scale with gear, give spriests another dot to keep track of and a way to get mana back, make prot palys get mana when other people heal them and have a taunt. Why don't we also add a way to pvp that takes actual skill and not just who grinds the most? We could also add a ton more max level 5mans to do and a way to get good gear from doing 5 man content. Also we could have a 10 man raid so that heaps more people can raid without having to manage al the admin of a big group... This is the problem with improving on vanilla. You just end up 'accidentally'ing TBC. So someone's already done all the hard work for you. Either TBC straight or TBC with no flying mounts is a pretty logical progression from Classic.
---
"They arent as good as warriors but I wanna play one"
---
Ah yes very good.
---
Haha yikes. Nah man I'm good. Ill tag you as "20% haste is bad for priests" guy so I remember ya
---
I hope I didn’t come off as ungrateful, my point was to just help priests know the best way they can be helpful
---
TIL I say both of them incorrectly... but I'm pretty sure at this point it's too late. I don't think I can bring myself to say bubble-HARTH.
---
I've always said Ska-la-mance. Had no idea others pronounced it differently tbh.
---
It's not really an issue (which is why you find a website that has what you want) because in Vanilla you don't do the zones sequentially - doing all the quest in one and then the next and then the next etc. You level in 2-3 zones at once, backtracking between them, getting training at a city, handing in quests, going to dungeons constantly. So it actually becomes pretty easy and straightforward to pickup up all the relevant important chains.  
---
  
---
If you're really concerned with levelling fast and efficiently, you skip 9/10 of these quests - they just aren't worth the effort. You probably won't do dungeons and you often don't even go and get training after levelling up unless there's a big upgrade to an important ability.
---
These posts are getting out of hand lol
---
His problem wasn't about respecing, his problem was whether or not respecing would change his "BIS". Its a legitimate question. Obviously the weapons change, but, for instance, does one utilize crits more than the other, does one have agility and the other not or at a lower focus, I totally get what he's asking, its basically "would I gimp my character by changing spec?" Or maybe, "is any of what I do as one spec salvagable for the other?"
---
This is not true. The shaman in our MT group would time the pulse to hit as close to where the fear took place and this largely worked. If things were really hairy the tank would also dance but having another warrior to taunt as a back up while the MT stumbled for a second was also fine. It’s really a non issue.

I can only speak for my experience but my guild had about 4-5 active Druid’s and would usually have 2-4 in any particular raid.
---
The one thing I can tell you for sure is that being a nice, consistent, and dedicated player is more important than literally anything. Your guild will raid with 9 Druid’s and 4 shaman if those people are the ones putting in the effort to grind mats, get good gear, and not fuck around in raids. While class composition is important, guilds don’t succeed and thrive because they have the perfect raid comps. They succeed because the people compliment one another’s strengths and make up for their short comings.

I would love to hear my boyfriend asking me that, but he only plays single player games or battle royales :c

---
This has to be a joke lol
---
Sure, and that's fine. I just have met several people who think that you are an asshole if you don't go out of you way to buff them, instead of being grateful for when it naturally happens.
---
The problem with this idea is obviously that if the servers start to dip in populations, both sides will feel weak, instead of one version staying at an 'ok' level. The more you split the people, worse and worse it would get. 
---
Then theres the fact that some people may move on to the new version, but then find that they prefered the previous, or their friends for some reason stayed on the old version. Maybe not enough people moved over in the first place? Then anyone that 'did' move to the new game are doomed and unable to return. 
---
This has hurt private servers in the past. Maybe even led to a private servers downfalls. Not to say that it'd be a fast death, in fact it would be rather slow. 
---
I hope Blizzard doesn't go through with this. I don't even think moving on to BC would be worth the hassle unless it was unanimously decided by the community that it was time. Thats the kicker...when the game came out, the pacing was dictated by when the product was completed. Now, since the expansions are already designed and just need to be reworked into the new system, it becomes about when the people WANT the new expansions, but because it can't be split, they have to make sure EVERYONE wants the new toys. It's going to be a fine line to walk. Hopefully they are up for the task.
---
He probably bubble hearthed anyway. I would have. Currently my paladin is a Blood Guard in horde. Can’t remember the alliance one.. knight lieutenant maybe? Anyway when I transferred my guild leader that paid for it told me to name her tampon. Blood Guard Tampon.. attractive. 
---
I thought in vanilla there weren't enough quests to completely get to 60- that you had to grind about 1-1.5 levels once you completed them. 
---
It's not that. It's that they can find other DM runs WITHOUT needing to do the Warlock stuff. So they usually ran those instead.
---
Even getting Guildmates to do it was tricky. 
---
very good points
---
Doesn't your initial hit occur earlier with a fast weapon like a dagger compared to a slow weapon like a staff?  Maybe it has something to do with that.
---
Either way, yeah they tag mobs very well if you're waiting at a specific spawn point, but if you're competing for mobs in a "kill X mobs" quest, they're at a disadvantage to a mage or shaman.
---
Entitled brats xP. I always say thank you even when I get int buff as warrior Kuz at least my weapon skills go up faster

---
Yeah. I guess context is a big part of it. I have such a fond memory of battling for a quest zone in world pvp and seeing them just bow out at the slightest form of aggression...meaning you quickly established dominance over that particular spot of the map...for the time being. That zone control on pvp servers is what I live for while leveling. Makes questing thrilling. 
---
Not just the Shah-men, but the Shah-women and Shah-children too 
---
For my 5 cents I'd advise in always thinking how will this speed up/help my levelling.
---
Is that how people are supposed to tame pets? I've always ever just hit tame and hoped I didn't die first....
---
This one triggers me so bad. For anyone wondering, it's pronounced uh-NATH-uh-ma
---
Yeah, I nearly got kicked out of my first raid guild for that one.  It was strictly banned in raiding after the first three minutes, but somehow they didn't know how it worked to tell it was me.
---
BC was my favorite version of the game.
---
I joined a guild with about 25 level 60 characters online at any given time early in vanilla, I was in my 40s.  I got kicked out for talking too much.
---
What if we stopped reposting this same topic for just a single day?  
---
Christ, dude.  This is a game, not a job.  If it was a job, you'd be sued for violating workplace law.
---
The thing that people don’t understand about pserver semi-HC players is that we really enjoy the game for what it is, and (most of us) also have jobs and lives and don’t want to or aren’t able to play 24/7.
---
So the calculus is that you should get your world buffs, bring consumes, etc. so that you can get the raid done quickly. If you don’t, it’s kind of like disrespecting the group. Everyone has a life they want to get back to, they just also want to raid for a few hours a week.
---
North of dale, my guild is clearing AQ/BWL/MC weekly. With world buffs and consumes these three instances take us ~5-6 hours per week, and I’m talking total time from when you log in to when you log out, not our instance speed records added up.
---
So for 6 hours per week I get to raid the content (some of which I never saw back in the day) and play the game I love with a bunch of fun lads, but I don’t burn out. World buffs and consumes are what make this possible.
---
In Classic, I think most endgame guilds will end up running this way. No one wants to spend 4 hours in BWL in 2019 when you can do it in 40 minutes. 
---
Why would you even reroll to begin with? Every demon name is unique, that's good enough for me.
---
Annoying kid
---
It doesn't drop loot because everyone plays on the easiest difficulty and still dies 40 fucking times, the games not hard on hard difficulty and its hard to find hard game sessions unless you start one yourself because everyone wants a hand held retail wow experience with every drop being an epic or higher. That being said its still a garbage game.
---
As a solo player yea you will run out of quests around 58 or 59, but you could easily run instances with lots of quests like BRD or strath.
---
Saying you need to grind 60% of the time is completely false
---
Similar to Retail. Install Retail (free trial to 20) and give it a shot.
---
Won't be perfect, but should give a good idea of what you can expect.
---
The interesting question is not how many will come back, but how many will start.
---
I’m 31 and played classic when I was in my late teens. The thing that amazes me about my pserver guild is that half the guild is 18-22.
---
Classic is coming at a really interesting time for gaming, when it could spread via Twitch/YouTube and the kids might be hungry for something different and more immersive than the latest MOBA or BR game.
---
- Release Classic and it’s consecutive patches until Naxxramas
---
* Idea 1. Release consecutive expansions as individual servers, keeping Vanilla as a permanent way to play. Allow paid character transfers. Great way to make money and allow folks to play the way they want to play
---
* Idea 2. Redo the story after Vanilla. I’d obviously hope they stay close to TBC and Wrath, but I’d like to see the whole world utilized.
---
Agreed Paladin.
---
Pre-fight, you buff, no difficulty there.
---
During fights, you target the tank and press whatever button you have "Flash of Light" on every 1.5 seconds.
---
Is this a joke?  Have you been on a private server with over 10k people on?  You sit at quest points with 20 other people waiting for respawns.  The only thing that breaks that monotony is constant waves of opposing faction in every zone.  You may enjoy it, but its absolutely not how blizz intended the game to be.
---
Good lord you don't realize how many there are until you see them all listed.
---
as a priest main i'd agree. the biggest factor being that the class kit has an answer to almost anything, and is the most well-rounded imo. there are fights where pally/sham/druid fill a certain niche better, but a priest can still fill most niches and excel at it, even if another class may have something slightly better for the situation. a good priest can really shine in sticky situations
---
Pretty much this.
---
What fight has fears that is tauntable? It just seems so much worse than stance dancing in every fight I can remember. I don't mean to come off as abrasive as I know I am, but with how big of a deal fear ward was considered to be during progression raiding it seems so strange to me to hear shamans stopping fear as an upside for horde and shamans over paladins vs "needing" a dwarf priest for Fear Ward. Fear Ward and Blessing of Salvation were pretty much the two most talked about reasons that raiding was easier for Alliance during vanilla WoW.
---
You have to be this geared for enchantment shaman to
---
Work.
---
A rogue is a little worse than warrior in DPS but a good rogue can compete for top spot (on k3 there are rogues ib the top 20) and has the ability to control agro better.   ALso needed for suppression room
---
Horde favoritism now that made me laugh harder than the meme.
---
90% of private servers are euro, you can try to do the mental gymnastics to blame it on literally everyone else but it just makes you look like an idiot
---
Once you hit 50ish you should be educated on your pre-raid bis items- most of them cloth (if you're a healer). Luckily for me I paid attention to that list and was 90% pre- raid bis as I hit 60 and was able to join a raiding guild right away and eventually got to clear Naxx and get full T3. 
---
I wont be rushing either, my aim is to be 60 with pre-raid BiS within 10 days of launch.
---
Agreed. Also my fave. Love vanilla though. 
---
troll /joke before it got removed.
---
Not all of them work in 1.12, not sure what classic will support.
---
If you want to raid at higher level Human for ally, orc for horde.    
---
but for ally Dwarf stoneform helps in pvp,  NE gives an extra stealth level and 10 extra NR is nice in AQ  
---
Horde well Undead look cool but Orc are still better, stun resist helpts if you get jumped (which does happen)
---
warriors in endgame guilds end up using fury/prot builds with a mix of dps/tank gear on and end up taking more damage than a druid all in the name of more threat
---
or you could just use a tank that naturally does more threat in the first place
---
your choice, i guess
---
I've seen folks totally skip Ony chain on their alts due to the hastle. If the server you play on is a high pop one, it might not be that bad.
---
 In my exp. I don't fully remember the alliance side chain since my friends rushed me through it and I didnt even know what it was for.
---
The horde side was very annoying. Most annoying part is looking for Rexxar that walks from top to bottom of Desolace. You gotta find him more than once.
---
what makes it worse is that thrall himself on retail (if you walk by him in dalaran on a shaman) says the "shaymin" you illustrate here
---
almost gave me an aneurysm when i heard it the first time
---
I don't recall *Any* end-game tanks tanking MC without a shield, but Vanilla was over 13 years ago, so...
---
&gt; Then realize your spells are more expensive 
---
Got some sauce on that?
---
- Warrior all skills 1-40: 34g 38s
---
- Paladin all skills 1-40: 43g 88s
---
Yours is a comment I hear quite a bit, but from the math I've done, all classes are within 10g at level 40.
---
Still a 90g headstart at level 40.
---
I was the warlock class lead for my guild on a PS. The mage class lead and I had such in depth spreadsheets as to who would get what item when it dropped, but it was so hard to get it through the thick skulls of our other LC members who ultimately had an equal vote as to who got what item. 
---
I nearly cried in frustration when they gave Nef's Tear to a mage so he could get rid of some his hit gear for more SP instead of one of my warlocks who still wasn't capped and definitely deserved it....and cried again when they gave Royal Scepter of Vek'Lor to another newer mage who was still wearing a green OH and had made no attempt to replace it instead of one of my warlocks who hadn't gotten a weapon upgrade since MC. 
---
Level 40 mount is a quest reward for Warlocks and Paladins.
---
60 takes gold and mats, but can still be quite a bit cheaper when farmed.
---
I'm not one to look a buff horse in the mouth 
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I'm sure it's heresy around here, but I thought what they did in Cataclysm was kinda funny.
---
(Made him a level 85 super elite that 1 shotted you for all the players that killed him over the years)
---
I don’t mean to flex, just some happy thoughts as we approach launch of course 
---
Hope you don't get invited and the little shitter that started in Legion does 
---
I know I was just kidding. I'm happy too man, this is going to be great.
---
Mage!
---
Teleport, sell portals, and make your own food / water. This is a huge deal for vanilla.
---
You're going to be welcome in dungeons / raids for your damage, cc, and food. You will be close to top damage with your pre raid set and dps rotation is super simple.
---
End game you can farm gold fairly easily, and the bloodvine set you will use until AQ, you can buy on the ah.
---
Honestly I've tried to roll other classes on private servers and ultimately end up re rolling to mage because once you play them, you're just spoiled.
---
Not to mention they're awesome in PvP as well! 
---
Will you be rolling your main in beta or try something else just for the heck of it?
---
1000% roll either a new faction or new class or both.
---
Tweaker
---
Orc rogue, combat daggers at 60. I've thought long and hard about it.
---
Night Elf Protection Warrior through and through for me. I rolled him at Launch and he is still my main. Wouldn’t feel right to go on another adventure without the guy. 
---
The human joke about LOTR might be longer.
---
I rolled a nightelf warrior back in real vanilla, I was a teenager at the time, most I ever did was tank something in aq 20. So I totally understand going back to your roots, I hope it all works out for you
---
Your comment made me laugh harder than my meme
---
Pretty sure the human joke about LOTR is the longest anyway.  
---
Ready steady GO
---
I play a mage and that was my azuresong
---
OMG, Cairne's going to be alive again...  I hadn't actually registered that until now.
---
&gt;8 hours ago
---
They killed him off screen.
---
Lmao I had friends that called it a Skimitar  xDxD
---
Lol, RS2 and OSRS were/are so bad in pronunciation of things it's unreal. I was playing some other game with a friend and on our chat some friend he met on OSRS kept pronouncing everything so atrociously bad from OSRS it hurt. Like Elysian to him was EE-Lai-jun. Also he thought Elysian was a word that Jagex just made up and woudln't believe otherwise...
---
Hee! Hee!
---
Yep, but swap cat with dog.
---
I have and the only time I've experienced what you're saying is when you're in the middle of the leveling zerg.
---
Last time I tried this quest, I figured it cannot be THAT bad. suddenly things start lagging and I get disconnected.
---
Never again.
---
Until Classic.
---
This YouTube account also has the tides of darkness lore too. 
---
How would reading a book help them pronounce words? Text in books dont show you the pronunciation. 
---
Does it really hinder your experience when you see some regards posting stupid shit in general ? Yes its dumb, but who cares ? People get so offended over the dumbest shit.
---
This is coming from someone who has put some of these idiots on ignore. It works very well :) Personally I love a bit of server drama makes for some fun
---
I feel like a damn sleeper agent that’s been activated.  My purpose is to play wow instead of assassinate the president. 
---
You couldn’t pay me to play retail now I just want to play classic again &gt;.&lt;.  I thought I was completely over wow. 
---
It’s the opposite for me in Aus :) can’t wait for a classic winter!
---
Hey man I had high hopes for anthem...
---
BioWare/Ea has some good marketing for an unfinished buggy as hell game.
---
No you are correct, UK citizens can't pronounce anything correctly nowadays.
---
Nice Unbreakable thumbnail 👌
---
&gt; Do you have any proof of them not being Blizzlike to the point where that could be the case for such fast times?
---
I think this is an illegitimate attempt to reverse the burden of proof. If pirate servers produce totally un-Blizzlike results I think it's up to their defenders to prove that the results are genuinely Blizzlike, not up to anyone else to debug all their code and prove an error exists.
---
&gt; The game have been figured out and the meta game today in about any online game, is to look up guides and to at least to some extent, try to optimize your character/gameplay. 
---
Do you really think Elitist Jerks and the other top guilds weren't doing this? If you do, then you just weren't around and taking the game seriously in vanilla.
---
&gt; There's a bunch of mechanics and items which a lot of people or even nobody actually knew the true 'value' of, back then.
---
Yeah, that's the myth the pirate server crowd repeat to each other. The world's top guilds in 2006 had never played a MMORPG before, didn't know what a spreadsheet was, didn't have access to combat log parses from actual vanilla gameplay, didn't know the keybinding submenu existed, didn't have mice, didn't know +damage increased damage or +heal increased healing, didn't know about downranking, and didn't know that having something in your weapon slots improved rogue and warrior DPS. Every single person in the world in 2006 was an utter moron who had never played a computer game in their life.
---
Except... they *did* have access to the true value of the mechanics, because they could actually test it on a live vanilla server. And they did have accurate combat logs and spreadsheets and it wasn't all based on guesswork from shitty old youtube videos with who-knows-what variables not accounted for.
---
&gt; I don't think it's farfetched to think or believe the best of the best, is much better now than back then. Especially for a game/sport/whatever which wasn't fully understood back then. This goes for about anything competitive in our lives.
---
That sounds logical until you remember that the skill ceiling in vanilla PvE is knee high and made of solid granite. I don't care how fucking special you think pirate server players are, they is no super-special super-secret pirate server optimised way of mashing frostbolt or shadowbolt that does three times the damage of the way the top 1% of mages and warlocks were mashing it in 2006.
---
It's like saying you have a friend who is ten feet tall because we know lots about nutrition now, or that you can score 301 in bowling because people know so much more about the bowling meta. You can tell me until you are blue in the face that you are sure you did all the maths right, if the outcome is nuts then the question is not whether you goofed but where.
---
That’s a good point actually. The value is not inherently more for one character. This makes sense to me, but it’s not what happens in practice.
---
just fyi, here's a thing that definitely happened in Vanilla/BC.
---
1. Player A blatantly ninjas something in a pug
---
2. Player B is pissed, screenshots it and sends it to the guy's GL
---
3. Player A gets gkicked from guild to protect the guild's reputation
---
I like this idea. I will likely level a main and a secondary. 
---
This is a lie. We all know "gnome" is the most commonly used word in this game.  
---
In Wrath, one of our fury warriors called Ulduar, 'ew-la-dar'.
---
Shoot, so THATS why we never got our Dance Studio..l
---
What’s wrong with Danish guilds? :)
---
But this one was worded slightly different than the one from a few hours ago!
---
His example is literally Hogger, a boss mob which will drop the quest item for everyone in the party.
---
For quest items like Defias Masks you need to collect multiple of, you should have the chance of looting them if you get the invite. Standard RNG and loot rules apply, but you would be eligible for loot.
---
Maybe it is you that needs to read more carefully. 
---
Its a pretty big deal yes. Post 1.10 Shadowmeld is quite a bit worse, but its still very useful since it can make the difference between getting off an Aimed Shot and not, which if you managed to Aimed Shot someone in PvP, youve pretty much won the fight. However, the instant break on Shadowmeld makes it so youll get those Aimed Shots less often.
---
Stoneform on the otherhand is purely an anti-rogue ability, though considering Rogues are the most popular PvP class and Stoneform can literally win you a fight against rogues, its well worth it.
---
So while Shadowmeld is certainly still a good PvP ability for Hunters, Stoneform just tops it now. Keep in mind, the other big swing to this decision was that Stoneform used to slow you up until about the same time, so not only did Shadowmeld get nerfed, but Stoneform got buffed, which created a huge swing.
---
This guide is largely silly. Sure group for some mobs that are kill quests but not for loot quests. If someone is killing around a node feel free to grab it, players don't have a hit list of every player that stole a node. My rule #1 for classic wow is get mine. I'm running dungeons for my loot  or my experience. If something is mutually beneficial then sure. Leveling is a grind and adding to that grind for some random isn't good etiquette, silly.
---
I'm sure most of them are just the same
---
If u have any specific questions lmk I’m maining a Rdruid on a private server 
---
Agree, they are also helpful to what level to be when approaching a zone. Though I just can't see them to be practical to follow at launch due to the point about congestion.
---
Hi, /u/FriskyChicken
---
Not chat but I grew up playing WoW, and my dad struggles with pronouncing new words. So I'd hear him say them and assume that's how they're said. Safe to say, Gnomeregan is not pronounced "gnome eh nor eh gan". Terokkar isnt "terkar". And Shattrath isn't "shattereth"
---
This has always been the best leveling build in vanilla wow for priests. I remember going on the forums during retail vanilla for a priest alt and seeing some lvl 60 (troll?) priest post this and he had pages of people not believing him. But it is much much better than early shadow. Usually people will tell you to just switch at lvl 40 for shadowform. If you want to get really technical, I've heard once you get to lvl 37 you can be a more efficient lvler going to shadow, but I've never tested that and just stayed until I can at least get shadowform.
---
I got mine during the BC pre-patch because they lowered the price.
---
My favorite character right there. Plan on doing whatever quests are tied to her.
---
The guide doesn't lead to congestion, bad quest design creates the congestion. The guide is just the most efficient way to do the quests everyone else is doing.
---
The top is pretty rounded/smooth, but I suppose the side of the mouse with the buttons is a hard edge. If you just Google "UtechSmart Venus" it should come up with pictures.
---
My 35 year old dog died and it was funnier than your meme. 
---
For me it all depends on when they announce launch. If they don't give much notice then I'll be stuck behind the pack. I'm leveling a garbage class to level too so its not going to be fun either way.
---
Actually the Paladin Mount is probably more costly and definitely more annoying than a normal Mount. The time it all takes you could spend farming much more Gold.
---
And the Pallymount is a spell, which means you need Mana to Mount and you can even get counterspelled to stop you from Mounting! (not sure if thats still in 1.12)
---
Hum no, play vanilla wow and stop invoking fake memories from 2005 and you might just stop talking out of your ass. "Easily" gosh you're delusional
---
Ah. I thought the video said that had been normalized in 1.9. Misremembered!
---
In the times I leveled on Nost and Elys I bet I grouped up more until Level25 than I did on Retail since like Casualysm. 
---
Nah. Summer time I'm gonna be outside doing things. I'll probably get classic in the fall or winter.
---
Gank to me is more repeatedly killing. On a high level person. A ganksquad is a group of people achieving the same goal. 
---
What is world buffs? 
---
I hope they pick it up I really do. But I can’t see the newer generation getting to level 60 before giving up. Although, I am looking forward to leveling a rouge just to gank unsuspecting streamers and the world pvp madness that can happen because of their large audiences. 
---
Net 80 upvotes, but damn urekt me mate

Just check joana's guide https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm

---
Good luck getting that Hand of Ragnaros this go around, Shaymin!
---
No it was definitely a weird flex.
---
I find mispronunciations by native speakers unforgivable. It shows a level of lethargy that immediately puts me off continuing a conversation.
---
Also PSA to warriors: a hunter can equip swap that Str + melee attack power rare weapon in combat to get more melee dps, so you should pass on the roll.
---
I'd be interested, totally. 
---
I'm loading up the talent calculator every 5 minutes when a new idea comes to me. Basically playing World of TheoryCraft all day.
---
You do realize that's on an empty server with no one aside from him playing?  Aside from the fact that he tells you lots of times to grind, you won't be able to do most of the quests he does on a POPULATED server let alone a PVP populated server, so you'll have to grind, A LOT.
---
There's logic to both pronunciations of hearth.
---
Heart + h and H + Earth.
---
You missed some of the most popular ones , here's a sample for your viewing pleasure: 
---
Tailorer , blacksmither, enginier , inscriptioner ( retail mostly) and my favorite one of all, enchantement shaman.
---
You can, and you should.
---
Lupos will never have shadowdamage in Classic. I had Broken Tooth for most of Vanilla and all my Rank13 Run with my Hunter and still love him. If I play a Hunter in Classic I will get Broken Tooth again. 
---
Remember, though, you don't need 12 million subscribers for Classic to succeed.  100,000 long-term players would be a coup for the game.
---
I play a rouge. 
---
It's not an empty server, watch the videos. Just a fresh server and he gets ahead very early.
---
Yes he does tell you to grind a couple times, such as 53-54 in Azshara and 58-60, but this is a solo speedrun. If you do group quests and instances you won't need to grind.
---
You can quest just fine on a populated server, I've done it on fresh pservers. 
---
What if they didn’t..?
---
Where is Mankrik’s Wife?

Arcane | Fire | Frost
---
Play an Aff Mage!
---
The Classic bug has bitten me, hard. I've watched all kinds of YouTube videos about it, went back and found all my old screen shots and Fraps videos from Vanilla, got in contact with old WoW buddies... I am very excite. 
---
Your self control is astounding 
---
I'm convinced it's because curiously a lot of rednecks play wow 
---
That’s weird I’m from the UK and I always thought ‘shay-men’ was the weird American pronunciation and ‘shah-men’ was the European pronunciation.
---
I looked it up and here’s what it says:
---
Thrall yells: Let it be known that &lt;name&gt; - Horde &lt;class&gt; - has earned the undying respect of the Warchief. He has engaged in great diplomacy with Timbermaw Hold and performed valiant actions for them on our behalf. He has gone above and beyond the call of duty. Three cheers for &lt;name&gt; - a true hero of the Horde!
---
thanks but I'm already intiligint enough
---
I always laughed at all the hemans running around
---
Heman
---
Heeman
---
Heeeman
---
Heaman
---
Etc
---
If mages are gonna charge for food; Druids should charge for Mark of the Wild. :V
---
Believe you're thinking of Gamon in Org, but yeah I found out about that today and think it's hilarious.
---
This is the most excited I have ever been over a game.
---
World of Warcraft notwithstanding.
---
Westfall coyotes I’m guessing 
---
Was is damn near every montage up till wotlk.
---
https://youtu.be/Brl7WmHDG-E
---
In-between for me.  The 58-60 dungeons are my jam.
---
Idiot. It's A-nath-i-muh.
---
\#No changes means no changes, right? Even if Naxx has been cleared for the 50th billion time.
---
And if they do add content, will they be fixing the hybrids in the process? If you answer no, why? Adding content makes it something else then vanilla.
---
Whoever did "Sweet Amber" questline without thottbot/wowhead should be able to put that on a job resume.
---
So is shammy pronounced “shah me” or “sham me”? 
---
I'm just gonna be a rogue and be a jerk to alliance as much as possible as often as possible ^_^.
---
that'd be cool too i guess
---
Also PSA to Warriors... just let the hunter die. Eventually they'll be rolling on that sweet gear you need endgame.
---
What's with the distorted aspect ratio?
---
I guess my knowledge of vanilla didn’t consider the ramifications of doing that. Thanks for the heads up
---
i have a question. you invest in divine fury but then in your guide, your holy dmg rotation doesnt even normally include smite or holy fire. so why bother with divine fury? wouldn't blackout be better since you are at least casting shadow spells each pull?
---
I really enjoyed solo AOE frost grinding on my mage.  I would frequently have people queuing up to watch.
---
I've been enjoying the hell out of Skarm videos!! It's this type of information and simple, straight forward talk that has got me engaged and contemplating tanking in Classic. I was a Rogue/Paladin/Priest back in Vanilla and was really lacking in tank mechanics and knowledge outside of the very basic and needed info.
---
Gotta love Skarm!
---
This video doesn't go into how much extra threat dual-wield tanking generates nor how much time that saves over the course of a raid. 
---
Does anybody care to elaborate? I'm interested in knowing.  
---
Yeah where is the origin of this pasta
---
Huh, I always thought it was Ach-in-doo-un.
---
When I hear youtubers or other raiders call C'thun "See-thun", I gotta shake my head man. It's supposed to be pronounced like C'thulhu the mythical creature, or basically how the developers say it, which sounds like Kathoon.
---
As a kid I watched this alllll the time. These PvP videos got me into the music I'm into today. Between Unbreakable and Grim (rogue).
---
SW port 1g?
---
fuck oath
---
It’s Shamai obviously
---
where can i find your guides?
---
Lmao, you're right. For some reason, I thought this was Gamon and not Cairne.
---
^^^I'm ^^^not ^^^racist, ^^^I ^^^swear.
---
The way they thumbnail videos these days is ----&gt; PAINFUL
---
I cant remember but how were you able to talk to the bosses?
---
I still rememeber researching races and classes all those years ago. It was probably late 2005, and in early 06 I pulled the trigger and got the game after playing through the demo.
---
I went Night Elf Rogue and I was hooked. The whole idea of an MMO was incredible and I couldn't even fathom how invested I would become even in those first few days.
---
Going from PvP shooters and RTS games to full on fantasy RPG with a massive open world full of hundreds of other people in these zones... I was blown away. Still am, thinking back onto how innovative this game once was.
---
I think that's the big reason I'll be jamming out on some Classic. Go back to enjoying the exploration where every level up feels like an accomplishment and really immersing myself in the journey. 
---
Too many games these days revolve around end game loot drops and stat building. I just want to meet experience the story and the zones again while meeting some cool people along the way. No racing. 
---
Cause it's a phat ass meme
---
Welcome to the internet, where you can ignore stuff you don't like
---
That's a good point. Is "Shay-men" just the plural of Shaman?
---
TB has the shortest walk between the AH and the bank + mailbox. It's the most efficient city to have an alt parked there.
---
Can all sellables reserved please die? Might as run the dungeon 3 man if you're going to hoard all the gold.
---
as an Australian it gets weirder again,  
---
it's like shamwow with an "in " on the end Shamm-in

I know, weird.
---
Good to know I'm not alone. 
---
AQ40 is much the same, i can main tank just about everything in there too. I recommend a warrior for Fankriss though because they can shield wall when he enrages, same thing with the first boss of AQ20 it enrages at like 20% that's when the warrior can taunt / shield wall. Huhuran in aq40 needs a ton of Nature resistance gear and the plate ones have defense on them (crafted) so I also highly recommend a warrior to tank that boss but I can see it being do-able as a feral MT down the line when the guild out gears everything.
---
If anything I'm burnt out on my hype that I've been using to sustain my existence until it actually releases.
---
I know it's "Sim-itar", but that fucking game has made me read it as "skim-itar" in my head
---
In all honesty this is what really brothers me the most in WoW's storytelling these days. The game should be able to present its own story properly. Books should be for extra lore or for an artistic description of what happened in-game, not for crucial story events that are NOT SHOWN ANYWHERE ELSE.
---
Even then, the players have no role in the story anyway, so when a character dies it feels like something blizzard jut decided to do to the players. We, the players, on the other hand, only get to kill things and participate in conflicts that we don't care about
---
Ear + th = eerth. There's logic in that? Utterly ridiculous and irrelevant. 
---
"Herth" is not even an alternate pronunciation, unlike some words which have more than one correct way to pronounce. It's just wrong.

---
I would like to be refered to us sha-person. Check your privilige!!! 😣
---
I want people like you in my guild. Let's show community is still here. &lt;3
---
1 sweet week? What after that? Just quit your job for at least a year. Then find a new one.
---
As a cloth dps class officer I can only speak from the dps perspective.
---
I don't know the exact numbers, but in a lot of fights, a lot of stages of progression, a lot of dps, mainly fury warriors and warlocks with no ways to dump threat, are threat capped and so need to throttle their dps to not pull threat. (rogues would be in the same position if they didn't have a threat dump. mages have a lot of threat reduction mechanics)
---
By the tank generating more dps + threat by dual wielding and speccing deep fury + prot build, your *entire raid* increases their dps significantly.
---
Imagine this way, (just hypothetical numbers) if the tank is doing +100 dps extra because of dual wielding, and you have 10 raid members throttling their dps because they're threat capped, then that extra +100 dps actually translated to a +1,100 increased raid wide dps. A huge deal.
---
Higher threat also means higher dps which means faster clears and less total damage that the boss has a chance to inflict, especially raid wide damage, which means less mana used from healers and dps, etc.
---
There are just so many benefits to higher threat and higher dps from the tank. Of course there is some sort of balance between dps and mitigation and it's often fight specific. As a ranged dps all we've really got to do is watch the threat meters.
---
The MT has so many decisions to make and their decisions affects the style and speed of the entire raid.
---
This entire video can be summed up as "you can massively outgear Vanilla raid encounters fairly easily", which is true but I really hope people don't expect it to be the case with Classic because it'll kill a lot of the fun if every raid expects every person to be min/maxed out the ass. 
---
No one is stopping you from joining a casual guild which will progress less slowly and less far.
---
Wouldn't be shocked if during that excessive time frame the first delay was from forcing them to pivot towards loot boxes, and then a delay and shoddy scramble near the end trying to half-assedly pivot away from them since public sentiment has finally started to galvanise against such dick wolfery.
---
Shay-man. Please guys, get it together
---
Might be off topic, but today I was trying out your early non contest with a dwarf paladin, and I'm jsut curious about your weapon choices when you get past the non contested part of your leveling, how do you fair in combat? do you feel strong enough to get grinding ? what do you rather spend your limited money on some vendor items or learn spells? 
---
Dun more-o is what I say, is that wrong? 
---
Or get a mother fucking bird. 
---
Immediately? No. I certainly don't think so. I think you would be surprised at how many people that are currently playing for whom Vanilla - WOTLK would be completely **NEW** content to them. I think they will ride that first. Then MAYBE we will get new content within the binds of the relevant philosophies. 
---
Why wouldn't you open fights with a cheap shot if you have the option?
---
How do you say it? I've always imagined it to be "Dunn more oh"
---
I will do 50/50.
---
At first, I'll witness the launch hype, run every dungeons, make some friends, travel around the world and so on.
---
But in the mid 40's I'll just start no-brain grinding and finish the journey in 1d15h or so. 
---
For me, at that point, the character feels so strong ("Ultimate" talent, Mounted up, Has large backpacks, Professions can be leveled to 300, All gear slots filled with something, and so on) that it's a shame you're not doing the bigboy stuffs already, and I'm starting to feel the urge to get the 100% mount, craft myself some epics and get into the pre-bis collecting train in time :)
---
I'm saying if you play Vanilla this way, you're probably not going to be enjoying it for the challenge. It's just going to be guilds steamrolling through already solved content, which doesn't sound enjoyable to me.
---
More power to you if that's what how you want to play, it's just not how Blizzard designed the game to be played. 
---
Partial.  They don't tag them for you, but do tag them for not anyone else.  You have to do damage to get credit.
---
Yep, there's always be the joke about the naive intent of  winning/finishing an MMO.
---
Vanilla is a little different, because it is 'dead' (using that in the sense of an old language like Latin, meaning that the content is static and so not being changed and altered) and there's been a lot of attention on it, it is at least partially 'solved'.
---
So people are definitely going to apply a lot more direct game theory to it, which while distort/alter the landscape.
---
That said I would be interested on the opinion of people on this sub if changes were to be made to some of the more extreme behaviors on private servers (ie Devilsaur mafia and DireMaul solo farming). Sure it might be changed anyway because privates servers are guess work, but my point is about whether it'd be a good thing (even if only partially or temporarily) some of the already hyper optimised parts were tinkered with to stop the economy being distorted too quickly? (and give people a chance to explore and discover new options)
---
It's probably a bad idea really, because when you try and enforce an outcome with a change, you're sorta forcing yourself to make another dozen changes when they adapt to the first, which inevitable snowballs.
---
Off-topic, but I f there’s anything that Final Fantasy 14’s Main Scenario Quest is good at, it’s preventing major story changes from happening “off-screen” like that. The changes are shown and explained in the quest line and don’t occur for you until you get to them.
---
Even if they did add LFD to classic (really doubt they will) the xp gain from dungeons overall in vanilla was much lower. I feel like leveling purely through LFD in vanilla would be a painfully slow journey.
---
I had to make sure to skip school on days other than Tuesday because downtime was so bad.
---
The priest will get more than enough mana for a smite each mob pull, the normal rotation is just mind blast -&gt; SWP -&gt; Wand because it's best to use mana in bursts by saving enough up to replace wanding with smite spam till the mob dies. Also getting blackout procs and taking less damage doesn't really improve priest leveling efficiency by much because damage taken is so efficiently healed away by renew.
---
At least Highmountain Tauren taught us how to wear them on our backs.
---
Awesome post, just what I’ve been looking for! I was wondering about the 25g/hour though, what is that based on? Would you make more or less on a fresh server? Always thought you could get at least double that amount if you did 5 runs.
---
Consider the possibility of two weeks. HHnnnggg.

Buffs that the player has to go somewhere specific in the world to get. For example the buffs in the green section at the top of this [consumables list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MsDWgYDIcPE_5nX6pRbea-hW9JQjYikfCDWk16l5V-8/pubhtml#).
---
Hardly ever post long time lurker on reddit. Gotta day though the death of Baine was one of blizzards worst ideas ever I loved him from WC3. 
---
Well if you're spec'd into Master of Deception it's easy to, otherwise mobs can easily detect you and make it a waste of time
---
Oh, I'll definitely *port you*, to the nearest graveyard that is. 
---
I used to say Shah-min
---
True for US english but it's MEH-lay or MEH-lee in UK  (/ˈmɛˌleɪ/, /ˈmɛ.li/)
---
Buffs that aren't consumeables but rather buffs gathered around the world before zoning in the instance. Some are buffs earned from turning in a boss quest. Examples are:
---
* Onyxia/Nefarian head buff (melee AP, crit, spell crit)
---
* Hakkar buff (15% base stat increase+movement speed)
---
* Songflower (5% crit and spell crit, small increase to stats)
---
* Dire Maul tribute buffs (3% spell crit, 15% hp, 200 AP)
---
* Darkmoon Faire buffs (usually 1-10% damage or 10% intellect, but plenty of other buffs are available)
---
* Elune's Blessing (10% base stat increase, only available during Lunar Festival)
---
This is exactly me also brother
---
&gt;Recently
---
Exacerbating the issue is that fact that a in a voice over in Warcraft 3 a furbolg says “our shaman.....” and pronounces is Shaymin. Like....how, blizzard? How you do this??
---
You can't taunt the boss off on Onyxia/Nefarian, but what you *can* do is have your OT fear use zerker rage to immune the fear and they'll hold aggro until the MT breaks fear from Tremor. It's clunky but it works, at least until your MT gets feared towards the raid and the boss does a breath right as the fear breaks and MT gets the aggro.
---
A npc voice-over in Warcraft 3 also pronounces it shaymin. I don’t understand how blizzard let this happen 
---
It's strange because "playing this way" is not necessarily easier. Aside from the immense amount of knowledge it takes, all +40 people in the guild being on the same page,
---
it also takes a huge amount of time outside the raid. In fact, more time in total probably goes to "raiding" than it would otherwise, if you count the raid prep.
---
Personally I enjoy the process. It took me ~130 days real time to get lvl 60 during retail Vanilla. I had the experience of stopping to smell the roses. I agree that this should be the way the game is approached for the first time. You won't miss anything.
---
But I've leveled almost a dozen lvl 60s, done so much already, I want to push and push hard. It's not for everyone.
---
Just earlier last week we were getting DM buffs, at the entrance of DM:N summoning people in, and there was a rival faction guild doing the same and it turned into this massive king-of-the-hill battle where we were each trying to secure the DM:N entrance area so we don't get killed and lose our buffs. Was extremely fun. Then we smashed KT in Naxx.
---
Then you used to say it correctly haha
---
Good i hope all this pserver freaks go on the same realm so i can avoid it...
---
Paladin is as simple as can be. All-in-one dispel button (dispels 1 poison/disease/magic per cast) and all you have to do is spam Flash of Light. Holy Favor+Holy Light if you need a big burst of healing. Holy Light isn't mana efficient at all. You also ignore the 5s rule because you gain your mana from MP5 and crit heals so that's one less thing to worry about. You generally don't need to rebuff midfight since dungeon fights never last for 4-5 minutes and raid fights don't last the 15 minutes it takes for greater blessings to fall off.
---
Druids spam rejuv (sometimes) and Healing Touch. On decurse duty to relieve the mages. Also keep in mind the 5s rule with them.
---
Shamans need to keep track of their totems and use either Chain Heal or Healing Wave depending on whether there's raid damage or not. Lesser Healing Wave isn't really mana efficient. There's the 5s rule but you don't worry about it too much when you're spamming chain heals and stacking MP5.
---
I have no clue about priests but it looks like both their short and long heals (Flash Heal/Greater Heal) are mana efficient. Pretty well-rounded healers. Keep in mind the 5s rule.
---
Josh Corbett (countdown to classic) is public enemy number one for mispronouncing things from wow! Love him tho 
---
I'm a Medieval Man. Why do you keep touching me in the Age of Chaos?
---
Honest question, why do adds matter for Hunter's relative DPS to other classes?  Or is it just a coincidence that the fights with adds are also not fun for Hunters?
---
For that matter, what even counters Hunter in PVE besides forced into melee range (which doesn't happen in raids anyway)?  For example, movement counters casters.
---
Today was my turn to post this 
---
Yeah no that functionality wasn't present until TBC when they made changes to the API so this is probably a private server kill, the 2012 upload date hints at that. It could also be a kill made in TBC but at that point boss armor had been normalized and I can't really see a reason for someone to go in and clear Naxx on lvl60 characters during TBC so it's more likely that it's private server footage.
---
Free mounts are such a big worry off your back. You can freely spend your gold on gear upgrades, profession ingredients and recipes as well as bags and potions. While the other classes (except Paladins) have to live like Hobos, accepting the meager offerings of quest givers and lucky drops we live like kings. Life is good for a Warlock (and a Paladin). 
---
Did a quick search, [here's](https://worldofwarcraft.livejournal.com/2227437.html) a blog post talking about it in 2005, so it seems like it was real. As for whether it will work in Classic, who knows.
---
i knew a guy from runescape that would pronounce sapphires as sappheares lol
---
The largest vanilla realms housed around 4.5-5k players. Not 10k+. I do get what you mean tho
---
But how do you sell this stuff? Or accumulate and then do lets say a sendout every couple days / once a week?
---
On server launch you would save it. Because there wouldn't be much demand for it right away.
---
If you want to do more PvP than PvE then go mage, less gear dependency
---
If you want higher personal dps and want to be able to teleport around the world and make food/water for yourself (and everyone in your main city who keeps asking you), then go mage. If you want to bring way more utility to the table with Healthstones, Soulstones, and summons, as well as a curse that makes Mage's do even more damage, while doing ok damage yourself, go Lock
---
I believe those are sha-lings. Do they exhibit intense emotions of one variety and then try to kill you?
---
So his plan is to raid for 2 years as fury to get full BiS from all the raids, including months of raiding Naxx.  Then respec arms to start PvPing with the rest of the dying server.  
---
You should just PvP 100% from the start and go for at least rank 13 then enjoy some raiding.
---
I'm going to feel guilty for like 4 hours a day if that, life is over rated anyways pfft
---
&gt;Still am, thinking back onto how innovative this game once was
---
Was it actually?
---
I've heard a lot of people saying that it was considered an EverQuest copy.
---
(I haven't played EverQuest, I'm just asking because I don't know and I'm curious) 
---
That's more like I remember it at least. I remember that your tank (so me) would stance dance the fears, and if they missed one and you didn't wipe it was considered reasonably lucky, and if you had a tank that missed fears frequently enough to need a back up plan you should probably just get a better tank.
---
Many of the ingredients can be reused thought right? Can't locks who have done it use their ingredients for guildies quests? Thereby drastically cutting the costs.
---
And the ingredients cost less than the traditional mounts anyway by like 100+g
---
I've healed a bunch of pally tanks on the way to 60 and never had any issues with them. And like you said, tanks are so scarce, I'll happily take anyone willing to do the role.
---
This sub. It's a harmless meme, why the downvotes? 
---
I looked up the system requirements for retail and have no idea what they mean.  Back in the day they said 2 GHz and we either had a 2 GHz Intel CPU or a 2 GHz-equivalent AMD CPU AND WE LIKED IT.
---
Though it's 2 GB of RAM and some form of integrated graphics, so any laptop sold in the last 4 years should be able to run it.
---
&gt; There are some memories of MoP that I honestly want back, and for the most part I prefer Legion over any expansion after WotLK. 
---
Legion class design was just awful; it led me to unsubscribe and I haven't been back for any length of time since.
---
I don’t see why they wouldn’t, especially if classic is successful! I just wonder if they will go down an alternate route after naxx and add more content to classic
---
Theres always "that guy" that doesnt accept and tries his hardest to hit it first 
---
If WotLK is successful, do you think they'll release Cata?
---
This is what I want, or if we go the TBC route I want cataclysm
---
This sub too?  Please no
---
What? Mispronouncing is because they have only read the word and not heard it.
---
The pronunciation of 'heart' and 'Earth' is what I meant. I have no idea how you read 'eer' out of that.
---
Since Classic is not on the Vanilla 1.12 client, they'll need to reimplement this script, assuming it was ever in Vanilla.
---
IT'S IN REVERSE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING BACK IN TIME.
---
***God***
---
Get on  this next level of memery.
---
&gt;I have no idea how you read 'eer' out of that.
---
Maybe I can explain in a way you can understand.
---
"Ear" as in the thing on the sides of your head, is pronounced "eer". Earth has the letters "e a r" in it, plus "th".
---
By your "logic", ear + th = eerth.
---
This was meant as an example to illustrate how ridiculous your "logic" is in determining pronunciation.
---
Hopefully this was enough for you to be able to understand.
---
I feel like Cartman waiting for the Wii. Just pacing back and forth, come on... come on.... Speaking of which does anyone know if it's possible to freeze your self?
---
To be honest the joke is on you because by level 40 warrior should have a whole bunch of active skill to make levelling a pleasure, while sure you can prance around on your cheap ass mount all you like in ironforge but we both know you you’re in for another tedious grind for ten more levels before you can go kill undead in western plague lands and feel like you have actual kill aren’t literally auto attacking one enemy at a time. 
---
Lol. Ricehope is about 40% Chinese, 20% Russian, 15% US and 15% EU.
---
Surely at least 1 oceanic realm right ???
---
delusion isn't something to be proud of 
---
That's a stupid fucking name anyway.
---
If you can't figure out how to pronouce a made-up name by looking at it, the creator failed.
---
I'd guess that "Ardougne" is supposed to be "Ar-doon".
---
Simi-tar\*
---
Vanilla WoW and it's players didn't quit  or fail. Blizzard did. Now they are fixing that.
---
Don't be underestimate passion or what it does to people.
---
Can you elaborate on how you're able to play this much at 25? I'm just a few years older and I struggle to play for 15 hours a week 
---
Sort off, you still need to shell out 400g worth of mats. 
---
I'm in the same dilemma. Barring real life friends insisting on Horde I'm planning on going Gnome Lock or Mage. I played in Vanilla. I played both in TBC. I have played private servers since. I kinda feel like I know everything I need to know and no further amount of reading will help me make up my mind. 
---
Agree with the below comments to main priest. You have an aresenal of spells and cures/dispels to suit any situation, and can throw out some seriously chunky heals when you get geared. At the same, it's not SO easy mode that you won't learn basic healing tactics and mana efficiency. 
---
But probably the greatest thing about rolling priest is that all their tier gear is pretty decent for wherever you are in progression -- ESPECIALLY the Benediction staff from MC but also the ZG enchants. All things considered, it's pretty easy/quick to gear up a respectable priest. Hybrid class healers generally have to spend more time cobbling together BiS and pre-bis from random sources because their class gear (from raids and quests) and enchants aren't always set up to maximize healing done in the way that priests' are.
---
It doesn't seem likely. They didn't want to do classic and wrath is where the game started to get buggy and more complicated to code.
---
I doubt it, but I hope they go down an alternate route. Whole new expansion after Classic, including new different zones, new lore, some new spells/passives similar to BC ones, new talents from 60-70, etc but still keeping the Classic playstyle and feel. 
---
That was relatively easy as a cloth user because repair cost were so very long, like 30g go from red all over to brandspanking new. 
---
Yeah, me and my good friend are going to playing. We are both going to level 2 characters. 1 we only play with each other, and one that we will play when the other isn't on. I'd recommend doing something like that. roll a good "group" class to play with friends, and an efficient gold farming class to play by yourself. It's a little bit slower, but the game isn't going anywhere. 
---
This is amazing! Thanks.
---
Because it was hard and didn’t drop any extra loot. Blizzard learnt there lesson pretty sharpish because during the 1.5 dungeon set quests they made sure all the extra bosses dropped extra, extra good loot. 
---
Hope not. Vanilla forever
---
took some?
---
Marketing budget is higher than development budgets for most AAA game   in the past 10 years.
---
I have no idea how is it possible to spend 20-100 million on marketing but its the sad reality...
---
Without a doubt. The question is how many realms!
---
If my ping is less than 200 i'm going to freak out, #nochanges
---
Half of me wants them to take the old shool runescape approach and add new content exclusive to that game and not retail while letting the community decide through polls and keeping the integrity of the original game. But the other half of me says “fuck it just release TBC” im torn.
---
Until you fucked with a good one that would just trap the spawn.
---
I loved it back then
---
And I still love it today. But I do agree that people hated it at the time for its crazy size. 
---
Do remember that TBC was very well received and only had circular dungeons, same with wotlk.
---
No thanks, BC is where things went to shit, and most people are too blinded by nostalgia to see it.
---
Even without one playing at 150+ ms would be authentic vanilla for me
---
That why you cast the level 1 vision on them. Them be dumb smart warriors. 
---
If 1vX in world pvp is a big thing than go lock due to its survivability. For bgs and pve mage might be the better choice. 
---
US Frostmane Horde represent!
---
This applies to MMORPG fans in general. Just have a peek at r/MMORPG which is basically just a bunch of people saying how much all MMOs suck.
---
Anyone with a dedicated plan can and will hit 60 in under 2 weeks. Joana did his runs in 7 days IRL. 
---
Is he a warrior or a shaman? 
---
Rolled warrior (orc) as first and main. 
---
Bought white swords from vendors because I was a blademaster, like in WC3, and I needed to use a two handed sword. 
---
Enchanting... and blacksmithing. You figure out what the fuck I was thinking. 
---
Minor beastslaying though, minor beastslaying on all my weapons for that sick, sick glow. 
---
Stacking agility so I could be a "dodge tank," again like the blademaster. 
---
Avoided killing mobs while traveling, felt like it would slow my leveling down. 
---
I always thought it was Dun More-Off because Dun More-oh felt too obvious for some reason. 
---
Still, pretty sure it's Dun More-oh
---
That's pretty much how I expect to play. I used to raid back in vanilla, but nowadays I can't be arsed to put in the time and effort.
---
To hell with min/maxing, quick leveling, and skipping dialogue. I'll play any class I damn well feel like, and if some instance group has a problen with that, it's their problem.
---
Classic is going to be my Vacation Game. Slow and lazy, and utterly enjoyable.
---
Which one do you like spamming more, frostbolt or shadow bolt?
---
That's just plain BS and your opinion. It's not a gravy or any kind of natural law. 
---
Just because you can't pull it off doesn't mean everyone else trying is displaying, too.
---
Vanilla leveling is and always was about playing what you like... it's a different story when you're 60 and want to raid. 
---
Then you're talking about a server with a 10k pop but not 10k at the same time.
---
There would be 0 place you could farm at max lvl, because it'd be crowded. At most high lvl farming areas it was already crowded with 2.5k pop. 
---
5k or higher would ruin the game in so many ways. Economy would be shit,  rare loot wouldn't be rare and it would be so crowded.
---
&gt; That's just plain BS and your opinion. It's not a gravy or any kind of natural law.
---
I'm still waiting for a response to my post. I have heard no maths, no design counter-arguments, no solutions, nothing to all my points I raised in my gameplay post.
---
If you're trying to persuade anyone that I'm wrong you're going about it in the laziest way possible.
---
&gt; Vanilla leveling is and always was about playing what you like...
---
You're missing the entire point. OP doesn't want to sacrifice leveling efficiency just to be able to tank. There is an objective answer to that question.
---
You're coming in here with shit arguments, lazy writing, *and* you can't even manage to read OPs original post. Pathetic.
---
Its really like the Green Fire encounter and the artifact quests. Thats why I loved Legion so much, it was inspired by the cool stuff in Vanilla.
---
&gt;most “top” players that play private severs are rejects from retail
---
projecting much?
---
I played on the launch day of vanilla and burning crusade. I remember, at first, having my mind blown when I stepped through the dark portal. That being said, the magic went away quickly.
---
I know it’s just personal taste, but I’ll never understand how people preferred burning crusade over vanilla. Azeroth was so much better than Outland that it wasn’t even funny. I remember hating that I had to trade beautiful Azeroth with its varied zones and cities for Outland with its small amount of zones, space theme, and stupid shared city.
---
I also couldn’t stand the fact that I saw my guild, and so many others, fall apart due to raid size changes. It really was awful to see all the friends you made go separate ways due to a design change. Same with PvP guilds, as pre made battle grounds really didn’t matter at all anymore.
---
I won’t go too deep, but I just never understood the TBC love. Was it bad? Not at all. But it was such a drastic change from the Warcraft I loved that it bothered me. There’s so many other things that I felt that they could’ve done before abandoning Azeroth and sending us into space.
---
I always assumed that most people who enjoyed TBC over Vanilla probably started near the end of Vanilla or at the start of TBC. Don’t get me wrong though. I hope everyone gets a server that they can fully enjoy. 
---
o7
---
Oh really? That explains why he just vanished, I remember wondering about his absence a while back. 
---
Im pretty sure (with my 13 year old memory) that you only for saved once you killed a boss. So you'd be in the raid leaders instance, but wouldn't be saved until a boss was killed and receive the 'you are now saved to this instance' message in the chat window.
---
Marginal changes some way into the future (one 5 man that was intended but didn't cut it into vanilla, some quests in zones that were neglected, etc) would be fine I think, if they use the RS voting system.
---
That being said, such polls would split the community in time which might not be pretty for the health of the game. But first let's just get Classic and we see from there. 
---
In your post you mention hunter, in your title you mention lock. By your description in the OP I am just going to assume you mean hunter.
---
If you say:
---
&gt;My heart says hunter, but 
---
You should go hunter. PvE playability is not *that* bad as a hunter. Raids always require any amount of hunters, so some spots are guaranteed. They are also not very gear dependant, making you perform better in early raids and PvP with minimal investment. Finally, if your 'heart says hunter', I do not believe you can level up another class while having this in the back of your head.
---
"but apparently they arent good for PvE at all"
---
is this a troll?
---
if not this is fucking stupid and ignorant...
---
I am sorry , maybe the way that i explained was bad. I mean i have the hunter by my heart becuase it’s the only class that I’ve played in TBC, since I could only play vanilla till level 40 or so, as a mage. The decision is mainly between mage and lock, I just felt like mentioning the hunter as a part of a story, my bad.
---
Can't vouch for everyone, but maybe English is not their primary language?  
---
Like, take /u/royalplants comment right below, the word scimitar.  
---
To me, as an Italian, the word will always be spelled "shimitar", because of the Italian word "scimitarra".  
---
No matter how often someone might try to correct me, I will still spell it according to the Italian word, it's ingrained.  
---
I used to play with a guy from Denmark, and to him "gnome" was spelled with a hard g.  
---
Again, if it comes to native English speakers misspelling English words, I can agree with you, but I don't get blown if I discover an English speaking person misspells a non English word.
---
Did you just put anthem and classic wow in the same sentence? Wow. 
---
I can relate. I got 38 vacation days left this year and haven't decided when in the summer I will take some time off. But I will take 4 weeks off for sure so I guess I can take it when classic drops. Will not play all the days ofc but its still nice being free around and after the launch of classic.
---
Sounds interesting. But besides long way there is no mage/lock trainer in Darn. You will have to return to IF at least one time. I will prefer to grind a little in Westfall than make this trip. 
---
But i guess you are right about Darkshore. It will be the best for other Alliance classes.
---
Honestly if your heart says hunter, then play hunter. DPS in later tiers should not be the main factor for deciding which class to play. Hunters are fine in PVP, too. I see no valid reason not to roll a hunter if your heart desires that.
---
They don't mean vanilla, they mean private servers which are vanilla on easy mode. Actual vanilla didn't operate like this and I can't wait for private server players to see the vanilla raiding experience.
---
&gt; Clearly they don't read enough to know how to pronounce things correctly on sight.
---
This is the dumbest thing I've ever read.  
---
I've been reading English books since I was 8, and by the time I started **speaking** English, I got shell-shocked by how wrong my spelling was.  
---
You don't learn to spell a word by reading a book, dude!
---
That is so cringy and dated I could barely watch it.

I believe in the Dwarf intro cinematic the narrator says “Doo Mora” or something similarly strange and unintuitive considering how it’s spelled. Maybe it has a very some n for “Doon Mora”?
---
Lmao

Getting professional help is pretty sound advice for anyone dealing with depression though.

Ya on a related note PSA TO PRIESTS: Don't FORT the Hunter. FORT his pet! Thanks
---
Yeah but a geared Warlock is an unkillable god. 
---
It's a Furbolg, dude, different accent...
---
Excellent post, OP.  
---
I'd also add : If the game feels like a chore, stop playing and take a break. Enjoy the grind, don't turn it into your second job. 
---
i thought the second syllable was more was more mon then min
---
RemindMe! 1 month

&gt; Just because you can't pull it off
---
Ironic. Four months ago the YouTuber, CaffeineInjected, started a 1-60 Protection Paladin run. [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuMhQ_Udamw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=15) where he gives me a shout out for the help and advice I've given him on his run.
---
In this particular video the issue was with [SoR's broken swing mechanic](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ak3qqw/should_all_bugs_be_fixed_even_if_they_were/).
---
I guarantee that I know more about Protection Paladin leveling than you do. I've written extensively about it—some examples [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ajfy08/paladin_leveling/eevcrqs/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ad9al9/paladin_leveling_spec_question/edfovyn/)
---
You're missing the point. OP doesn't want to sacrifice leveling efficiency just to be able to tank. There is an objective answer to that question: Warrior &gt; Paladin. 
---
You're coming in here with shit arguments, lazy writing, *and* you can't even manage to read OPs original post?
---
Herthstone
---
I agree with some people in here. Im super competitive when it comes to games, csgo, LoL, OW and WoW up until legion. Raided in top 50 world guild, but when it comes to classic, I literally have no rush at all because to me, the leveling process and running around making friends and chatting with people while leveling professions and helping lower levels out is just as much content to me as any end game.
---
For whatever reason, I dont get competitive at all in vanilla wow, its the only game i can even consider as "casual" game. Havent played any single player games from start to finish in last 10 years, im all about competitive games and finally I have something that i can just chill in and have fun. I think one reason might be, because vanilla is fulfilling even for casual players / for people who cant put many hours into it, while on retail, the only enjoyment I can get is to push the limits and even that aint that satisfying to be honest.
---
Again learn to read. **That is a spec that works for both PVE and PVP for initial tiers which the OP originally asked for.** He isn't interested in a perfect spec for PVP he is is asking for a spec that allows you to also raid. You need the armor talent for raiding, not pvp. **You still always want 1 point in it because it acts as dispel protection in group PVP and alliance doesn't have purge.**
---
As far as Edward and money, money is why you make a mage alt in the first place. As I said they level extremely fast with only rest and AOE past 20 and in Classic you don't have BG's until BWL. You have the time. Ele goes through water like candy in PvP and farming 70 gold a hour in greens because Mage Blizzard doesn't need gear or scale with it, is better than 35-40. Black lotus spawns are also WAY different in real Vanilla and it's much more rare. DM gear at the start will mean many people simply won't bother with things that are a mafia on private servers (devilsaur). 
---
**Why the totem mana talent has priority**. Sitting there freecasting lightning bolt isn't an option unless you are steamrolling a pug where half the people are AFK (where ankh is useless), or you are playing retards where you will never die anyways in a good group or you are doing AV where mana is more important. Most shamans also play Orc because they are simply bad, including some of the "pro" eles (see vid I posted) and don't realize the combos you can do with tauren warstomp and nova or extended CC chains you can do on groups with stomp into a grenade. Orc is great (and pretty much OP) for everything except ele if you want to play it at the highest level.  Fire Nova costs A LOT of mana and you should be using it a lot vs good players who are going to try and stop you from freecasting. Good enemy players aren't just going to let you sit there and put out the most ranged DPS in the game in pvp, they are going to stick melee on you and interrupt the nature tree because shamans in premades also take up a lot of the healing slack and your totems are CRUCIAL which also cost mana. Shamans are the linchpin of the alliance in PvP just like Holy Paladins are on Alliance and if you aren't u sing those totems and utility that all cost mana you are playing wrong. Play a mage or lock instead.
---
Ankh is good for one thing and one thing only. 1 v 1 WPVP. Tauren warstomp means you really don't need it against bad players. You drop them in a shock, swing, nova, stomp, CL, shock/auto that can followed with a iron grenade for another combo  FAP potions make Orc racial much less important if you are that consumed with winning a one on one against somneone  like a GOOD rogue as well.  Before you say something about FAP making wstomp bad, FAP can be purged in Vanilla.
---
I never was hostile btw until someone who can't even read what the op originally posted attacked me for no reason, when they don't even know wtf they are talking about and never even read the OP and saw what the guy asked for.
---
One more thing. In premades? You don't spec Nswiftness. You go elemental mastery and obliterate healers. It's another reason why Tauren is better. That spec can still work ok out in the world due to the devastating combo you can do that I listed or due to being able to get a heal off and being "ok" without nswiftness. Orc? Not so much.
---
Have a nice day. Done with this stupid conversation and defending a post that answered questions that none of you did and then attacked me for.
---
Enjoy all your orc and troll shamans and improved ankh though.
---
&gt; Think about trying to min max your build in Diablo 3 but all the items that drop are blues, and the game insists you do Greater Rift 70 in order to get items you need to actually do greater rift 70.
---
Oh...so Diablo 2 before all the runeword crafts that made from obviously dupe'd runes.
---
Some people rather have a 7 year vanilla journey instead of 3 year vanilla + 2 year tbc + 2 year wrath.
---
Tbh they probably are still unsure, they have no idea how well this thing will do.  If it does well then yeah this is a conversation worth having. If it doesn’t well then why get everyone’s hopes up
---
A chill went tru my spine.
---
That is why you keep vanilla servers and merge the needed ones to keep population high
---
But the BBQ was awesome!
---
I hate this one most of all. It's abbreviated as "org", how do you miss the R?
---
What? It's nothing like what I wrote.
---
Dremlock anyone? 
---
Sticky night elves pages?
---
Jokes aside, nice catch.
---
1) Why would they release a game that is essentially the same as the modern game that is just about instances and. Arena and raiding? Modern WoW IS TBC. It's just missing the initial leveling experience that was Vanilla and not TBC. You can't credit that to TBC. TBC sucked outside raids and horribly balanced arena because all anyone did was 2 v 2.
---
2) Why would they then change and modify TBC instead of rebooting WoW/WoW 2 if the Classic design is much more popular?
---
They aren't announcing anything for a reason. They aren't stupid. They want to see how classic design holds up. If it's much more popular and **people love a game that isn't focused so much on raiding like TBC and the modern game is then they can go from there.**
---
TBC was the death of modern MMO's not the savior. WOTLK just polished the stupid mini games the best as far as hitting the most demographics. None of them are really similar to Vanilla. After WOTLK they catered further to the wannabe esport people and the game lost even more subs. People don't want a esport. They want a living breathing world they can lose themselves in because life sucks and we already have to compete in real life "esports" in our jobs, school etc.
---
The same people who ask for TBC Classic are the same people that ruined WoW and refuse to play what they ruined.
---
I just call it "a good krumpin' "
---
Yeah lets do it, get on this new track with me :\^)   
---
(dead serious)
---
The green fire quest was amazing and had me immersed for days trying to do it. I was really hoping we’d see more content like that.
---
Well, no because he's talking about the felsteed not the dreadstead.  
---
To be honest, I'm surprised by how much I am NOT hyped at all. Recent actions of Activision Blizzard made me hate that company fairly passionately. If it weren't for Classic I likely wouldn't touch any of their games at all.
---
Ultimately it's still so far away and we haven't gotten any actual news in between so as of now there really isn't anything to hype towards to :S I hope this picks up by the end of this coming quarter...
---
Down.
---
I’m super excited. Can’t keep away from this sub!
---
Is that all? If I was down in the yellow it was a rare and special day for me.

Is this from DK starting area?

Could you share a link to his guides please ? I've never heard of these and would be interested in checking them out

Would you mind sharing a link to his guides ? I've never heard of them and would like to check them out.

Personally, I'm doing a [Ret/Holy hybrid](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzMwAAEMONzzA) that I've theorycrafted on pservers for the past year. This is because healing dungeons is the most efficient way to farm the necessary 2H weapons to make leveling as efficient as possible. Thankfully dipping 20 points into Holy does little to affect your Ret's damage output. Here are some thoughts:
---
**Retribution damage package:**
---
The first 11 points in Ret are the “damage” package of Paladin builds. SoC + the following 2H progression give you the most bang for your buck. Everything else in the Ret tree is just a way of buffing this package in smaller (but not insignificant) ways. Because of a mechanic called [Parry-haste](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry), you should pick Deflection instead of Imp. Judgement (useless with SoC) and Imp. SotC (useless always.)
---
Here's the 2H progression path btw:
---
* Level 18-20: Smite's Mighty Hammer
---
* Level 20-29: Verigan's Fist
---
* Level 29-34: Corpsemaker
---
* Level 34-44: Bonebiter
---
* Level 44-50: The Rockpounder
---
* Level 50: Lightforged Blade
---
* Level 51-58: Ice Barbed Spear
---
* Level 58-60: Arcanite Reaper
---
* Level 60: The Unstoppable Force
---
This damage package is so cheap and easy to get that any Paladin who is not going Prot should follow this path. This means healing with a 2H, or switching to a 1H + Healing Off-hand for dungeons. Wearing a shield is going to do very little for you. Unless you care about the aesthetic of running around with a shield.
---
**Seal of the Crusader:**
---
Seal of the Crusader is obsolete in patch 1.12. [Here's a recent thread about it](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20765876950) on the official Classic forums, but I'll summarize:
---
SotC was supposed to be the “swing faster to get more procs” Seal. Unfortunately at some point around 1.9 Seal of Righteousness was changed (it's debatable whether this was intentional or a design oversight) so that the extra Holy damage component behaved mechanically as a second weapon swing.
---
This effectively makes SoR better than SotC in all cases: +100% swing speed vs a measly +40% swing speed. You should never use this Seal (nor it's Judgement.) Don't even buy SotC from the trainer!
---
**Pursuit of Justice:**
---
After SoC I'd recommend PoJ since distance will be your biggest efficiency-killer while leveling. Can't stress the importance of +8% run speed.
---
**Sanctity Aura:**
---
Mathematically, Ret aura beats Sanc aura because of poor stat scaling while leveling. This only changes if ~~you~~ your guild allows you to gear for full Ret endgame DPS.
---
**Imp. Judgement*:*
---
You should be using rank 1 SoC to level, which means never Judging it because you actually lose DPS by doing so. Not Judging SoC makes this talent worthless.
---
**SoR vs SoC:**
---
Seal of Righteousness is very close to Seal of Command. The break point between the two is weapon speed. SoC does a bit more DPS with a weapon speed of 3.5+ (Smight's Mighty Hammer, for example) than with SoR. SoR does more DPS with a faster weapon. Two sides of the same coin.
---
The reason I (and most Paladin leveling guides) recommend rushing SoC is because you're already rushing the Ret tree and if you can get Smite's Mighty Hammer from a Deadmines run you'll be a DPS machine until Verigan's Fist (which might not be easy on a fresh server because you need a high level player to run you through Shadowfang Keep.)
---
SoC will continue being useful up to level 60 since you should be targeting slow two-handers throughout your leveling experience.
---
But, there's a small catch. Verigan's Fist is the best two-hander you can get from level 20-35ish and it's speed is sub 3.5, which means you're going to be using SoR for that entire time. This is just the wonkiness of Paladin leveling: you're consistently picking up talents at just the right time when you're not going to need them for a while, lol.
---
**Additional Info:**
---
Don't waste gold on the following spells / ranks: Seal of the Crusader, Exorcism, Divine Protection ranks, Redemption ranks, Turn Undead, Hammer of Justice ranks, Lay on Hands ranks, Seal of Justice, Holy Wrath, Divine Shield, Blessing of Sacrifice. You won't stick around undead areas long enough while leveling in the early levels to justify the Undead-only spells. Maybe once you start hitting EPL you can pick those up.
---
Play modern WoW. It's all the stupidity TBC started.
---
\- You are never ever going to clear what you didn't clear. Talent changes and hundreds of nerfs happened through the course of TBC. You won't even get initial heroics. You are clearing a fraud. PVE is all TBC did pretty well and it only hit a small demographic of people who actually cleared all the content. It will no longer do that. Vanilla was much more than raiding. TBC isn't.
---
\- Before you talk about professions almost everyone cheeses raiding with leatheworking and drums now that people understand it. Enjoy that variety. 
---
\- Primitive group finder which evolved to something worse
---
\- Focus on hyper balance that took the fun out of the game and broke BG's due to healers being tuned around perfectly timed CC chains in a 3 v 3 bracket no one even played.
---
\- The balance people claim in TBC still sucked (and always will). Mages weren't even viable in Sunwell. You replaced them all with locks who did more dps in much worse gear.
---
\- AV that is complete trash
---
\- A lot of hybrid specs losing burst. Grats you can raid pressing one button now. Your spec now sucks at PVP now due to resilience. Happy?
---
\- WPVP that is dead. 
---
\- Dailies that replace real organic content in a living breathing world with things to be farmed.
---
\- Smaller raids and PvP that became all that mattered. Smaller raids mean a lot of fun people  who could be "carried" were left behind. It's why most people sat in Kara all expansion while selling TBC through rose tinted glasses.
---
**TBC is garbage. The people that REALLY liked it are the small minority that like modern WoW. The people that claim to like it never got out of Kara.**
---
Incredibly. I started playing in late Vanilla (about a month before TBC launched) so I never had the chance to experience end-game content let alone hit max level. I quit a month after BFA launched and I haven't re-subbed since because of how stale and uninspiring the game has become. 
---
Three more months? It's going to be a long wait... 
---
I remember PvP etiquette being something along the lines of:
---
Call the opponent a homosexual
---
Stab them in the neck
---
/hug their corpse before they release
---
I played a Lock in Vanilla, this time I will go Priest. Roughly how long it would take to get Anathema/Benediction?
---
Good post, completely agreed. What I liked about TBC were the expanded talent trees, which could feasibly be put into Classic anyhow. (not advocating for or against it)
---
Flying totally ruined the later design of the game. It permeated every design decision from that point forward.
---
I gave up years ago trying to pronounce it correctly. Now it's just Orkland.
---
But the phrase, "Sylvanas' dust bowl" is growing on me.
---
God, the dreadsteed quest was great. And for all the demons! And the enchanted gold bloodrobe.  *swoon*
---
What a rich, three dimensional world, expressed through the relatively primative tech from 2004. 
---
Close enough, lol.
---
Still cheaper than the 900 gold normal mount
---
I watched my Fraps videos from back in the day  just yesterday. It is hilariously bad.
---
Nothing like inane babble would wake me up on a monday
---
We get this thread every couple of days.
---
If Classic is a success, rereleasing TBC and WotLK *ad infinitum* is certainly an easier, faster, cheaper option to provide new content than making something equivalent for Classic out of whole cloth. 
---
Plus the Classic game engine starts to implode at Naxx-level gear and just isn't designed to handle anything past that without things getting really weird and bad.
---
Plus they have this team of coders sitting around who just converted 1.0 to the modern engine, who have the ideal skillset to update TBC, so what do you do with them to make a buck? I think you put them to work on TBC but don't announce it because you don't want people to hold off on subscribing until it comes out.
---
I don't think they'll ever kill vanilla again, that would be insane, but I think if vanilla is a success they'll almost certainly offer TBC servers in a couple of years time when peak Classic activity starts to die down.
---
I'll probably still scream down my mic like a fucking retard when I first kill Ragnaros.
---
You shield wall for every boss? With that one hour cooldown?
---
Speaking of min maxing, Troll &gt; Tauren warrior. 
---
Only if you're 'Murican.
---
It's pronounced "Ah-nah-them-ah" in real English. 
---
Or you play a NE girl cos you're one of those weird pervs that like to role play as a women like 90% of people who roll ally :D You can't fool us. 
---
Shayman you!
---
Lmao Im convinced this is a meme now. It's literally every other fucking post.
---
I agree with you on a lot of things except 2 points you make.
---
I do not believe blizzard have any plans of new content with the classic design philosophy. People who kept saying no change did not do it because vanilla was perfect, far from that. But its because we do not trust the mindset and thought process of blizzard devs to know what is actually a good and what is a bad change.
---
What you said about a living breathing world, is something i agree with wholehearted. The most important thing in an mmorpg is the sense of wonder around you, where you feel like you're on a journey with adventures around the corner with a great community all around you socializing in-game.
---
However, i do not see how TBC changed that design philosophy. I do agree that flying mounts killed world pvp. I also believe that arenas should have been some part of BGs, where you need to earn a number of honor points to represent your faction in a weekly arena tournament or something.
---
However, as far a living breathing world with a sense of community with everyone roaming around, TBC still did that, granted to a slightly lesser extent than vanilla.
---
However, where we lost some of the world aspects such as world pvp in TBC we gained more viable class roles, paladins and druids could now tank, priest could play shadow in raids, paladins, shamans and druids could now dps.
---
Yes i do agree with you that blizzard started making missteps in the additions made in TBC but common it was nothing like modern wow. And that is why i am proposing certain tuning being made to remove additions which we now know where bad for the game as whole. All of this because i do not believe that blizzard have what it takes or are willing to do the investment of creating a new game as great as vanilla wow was. Vanilla took 5-6 years of development and about 50 million dollars to make (in early 2000s). nowadays making a game on this scale would take 6-8 years and cost over 150 million.
---
That is not an investment blizzard would ever do when they can cash in on remaking what was already there.
---
[It's literally the same](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/anathema)
---
Some of my old guildies and I are already planning to resurrect the guild. Though, we are all older now with families, we plan to make time to casual on wow classic. Hell, I've even already begun customizing our discord server.
---
I will do exactly the same! But when our 3 days of sun and summer is over here in Sweden, I'll get my head into Classic soooo hard.
---
Holy shit, can you save vacation days or do you just have a dream agreement with tons of paid vacation?
---
And it will be glorious. Not the jam-packed starting zones, no fighting over every mob with 50 people (I hope). It's not how WoW was meant to be played.
---
Thanks man, I cringed so hard I got a cramp in my neck.
---
no no, i mean like.. your guild is farming naxx and youre trying to just plow through the games content together just for the heck of it endgame
---
its been a pretty popular thing on privates as of late because once you get far enough in the game, your guild is only limited by how much threat your tanks can do. fury specced non-defense capped warriors dual wielding (with remaining points put into things like 15% threat bonus) have been a thing as of late because at some point you can generate more threat than a standard prot warrior. however, you do become a lot less tankier, dont get defense cap, dont get to block.. its idosyncratic and odd, but functional
---
its like theyre warriors that are trying to imitate a bear druid, except with having tons less armor
---
Uhh, it clearly isn't.
---
You're missing the "ah" sound. Though the guy on there says it properly.
---
Never. It's strictly a DPS loss, even during long fights. SoC is slow af and JoR is too powerful to give up on pull.
---
Not long. The only bottleneck is a 50% drop chance item from Majordomo in Molten Core.
---
It definitely is. I’ll play, and enjoy my time, but it’s definitely just another thing to fit in around the rest of my life.
---
You're reaching, stop being a pedant. It's a difference of accent at this point.
---
I wonder what those two Shaymins are talking about. 🤔
---
So you force guilds/servers to split. Destroying a huge element of vanilla, a stable server community. 
---
On a side note no they aren't going to announce some big plan to replay all of wow.
---
Yes. Clearly those people should know it. Those a god-damn idiots!
---
I was doing ok and then this weekend the bug bit hard. Am weighing up Alliance vs Horde for my Moonkin, planning professions and alts, listing pets to farm and rep grinds to do . . . And we're 4 months away, if we're lucky . . . Urgh.
---
I levelled to 30 something from US launch as a feral druid, then another Druid on my server who had played beta said to respec.  Not sure of exact spec but I remember meleeing everything in NE form to proc Omen of Clarity and getting the free heal.
---
Then at 60, you specced Resto for the 31 point Innervate talent.  Innervate was nearly always used on Priests.
---
Can't remember much about the actual mechanics/experience of raid healing.
---
What exactly is splittint?
---
Server mergers means all the community from my server remains there.
---
Also when the server's community is still healthy no need for server merge to be done. 
---
I think you confused it with realm transfer.
---
Haven't seen "phat" since "phat lewt" in Vanilla.
---
Happy Cake Day! 
---
&gt; For the most part 95% of all druids now will be healing in raids 
---
Honestly on a private server every raid guild I've been in has had a feral OT.  And 1-2 resto druids.  My guild recently disbanded and I had the pick of 3-4 other raid guilds who all needed a resto druid.
---
Feral is a lot more viable today
---
I like raiding but the reward and goal for me is epic gear and pvp pwnage in said gear, so I would stop raiding sooner rather than later if it weren't for the prizes you can win. I know that sentiment is seen as shallow but I don't care, I like getting rewards.
---
I care
---
I was that ~~douchebag~~ numbah 1 most awesome fun-time guy who waited until.the idiot priests needed to drink and their warrior was at 20% Health to kill the priest and then run away enjoying my sick glee. I would laugh like the bad guys dog from Whacky Races as I reveled in the fact that I caused some Priest to quit WoW. Publicly I would say I did it for the horde. Really the whole time my heart IRL was as rotted as my undead rogue's.
---
No I'm not. It's just like I wrote above, guilds/servers would be split. Some would go to TBC and leave the server and some would stay. Then you add on splicing servers together for classic which would never go over well. This is classic wow not wow the trilogy.
---
Soon.  Not soon.  TM
---
I go through stages in MoBAs like dota 2 where when I first start playing it's all about getting kills and being badass. But as you play and get more knowledgeable you find out getting a lot of kills isn't that hard. To win against the tougher opponents it requires advanced teamwork, I appreciate that some players in dota can coordinate a plan without even speaking to each other if both are on the same level of thinking. I think wow is going to be the same in how the sense of accomplishment comes from leveling, then from getting gear, then from having a close guild or circle of friends you roll with.

You actually have the exact same idea I have.  I would do it with you but I’m unsure how you would integrate into my group of friends who I plan to be in discord with the entire way.  I plan to not sleep for the first 50 hours or so and just no life all the way to 60.  I’m gonna play on an eu PvP server too and I want to be ahead of the curve

Probably because you're a bit of a knobhead.
---
Oh I agree. They have no plans atm. They are waiting. They have lots of metrics here to. The best scripted private server is actually TBC atm. People are realizing it's actually the rose tinted glasses expansion though. The leveling is still great and makes up most of the population (and a lot of those players are just practicing for Classic because it's better scripted than vanilla servers and TBC leveling is almost the same), but **TBC Classic wouldn't do that. They would let you take your vanilla character over.**
---
TBC also has other problems because of that. It is a logistical nightmare. WOTLK went the vanilla route with multiple starting zones because of the catastrophe TBC was at launch, especially on PvP servers. All the changes necessary to even make it work again and play to it's strengths are too much work. They would have to do real progressive pre nerf heroics, phase the heck out of it and then you still have awful pvp with wpvp not really working, arena in a horrible state due to it being experimental and BG's that are awful where all that matters is how many resto druids queue.
---
**All that work to hit ONE type of playerbase, because TBC does only one thing well and the thing it does well no longer works due to talents, patches and nerfs.** WOTLK did the mini games about as well as they can be done. WOTLK would be popular. I didn't like TBC or WOTLK, but WOTLK would still be popular due to accessibility and minigames like wintergrasp kind of making up for design failures since Vanilla. 
---
So Blizzard has choices and waiting and observation is the best course of action. Do they release a TBC they know will do bad to get to WOTLK? Do they soft reboot WoW with Classic design or WOTLK design where you didn't have LFR but you had Wintergrasp, vault, pretty easy heroics/intiial gear farming and then the option of hard modes so that people still felt like they were doing real content outside a mythic? Modern WoW is the most like TBC design. It fails. Stressing raiding and a pvp esport over everything else simply fails. It should be abandoned. Think of Kara in TBC like LFR. It's all people did, over and over and over in bad guilds for the entire expansion.

Summarizes my yesterday up pretty nicely. Some alliance paladin had his high level warrior friend helping him out. This guy charged me out of nowhere while I was minding my own questing. When the warrior left the location, the paladin had it coming.

There is something truly sick about the Classic community. It's going to be interesting to see how the whole thing pans out.
---
On the one hand, people say "Vanilla is all figured out, it will be ez" and on the other hand, the best and most in-depth knowledge is rejected.
---
It's all for the better, though. More noobs means less competition.
---
Do some in the classic crowd secretly discourage BC servers to pad their own classic player count? I have a feeling this is a motivating factor.
---
Casters were so OP back then
---
that wasn’t really around in the vanilla retail days. 
---
Seems accurate to me. 
---
in 5mans its mainly tanks thatare needed
---
so the rezzer wont be an issue cuz I doubt the healer will be a druid

There is no Ice Barbed on release.

"shah-men" is the americanised pronunciation of shaman.

We don't know yet for sure.

Shah-men for American English, shay-min for real English.
---
No but Ion mentioned pvp related gear is often better than MC so it won´t be there on release. AV currently in phase 2. I doubt they will move it upwards.

neat

How about hunter? I really love lvling with him but mage is my main all the time on retail, so i have difficulty to deciding between them
---
Blatant racism, sexism and homophobia isn't some of the "dumbest shit" and yes it does negatively impact my experience. Ignoring people is of course a possibility, but when general and world chat is full of it then it's hard. I have left parties and guilds because of it though 
---
Hi, /u/Odiwbf

Where on earth did you get the a's from though? 
---
Isn't the whole point of being a grammar nazi to be pointlessly pedantic?
---
I won't be doing classic vanilla for 2-3 years. If they want me to resub for that long, they'll need to give us some progression server representation. At least up to WoLTK, though I'd love to see one go to MoP.
---
maybe let's just get classic and play it for a few years before jumping into f-ing expansions already.
---
So on tights rope right now if you were a fresh 60 lock.
---
shadowy pots x2 - 12g (vendor)
---
stardust x1 - 150g (vendor)
---
black dragonscale x35 - 17.5g (ah)
---
dark iron ore x25 - 8.8g (ah)
---
arcanite x3 - 62.4g (ah)
---
large brilliant shard x6 - 18g (ah)
---
shadow power x10 - 30g (ah)
---
then these or an 80-100g summoning service.
---
glyph - 50g (vendor)
---
jar - 150g (vendor)
---
lodestone - 50g (vendor)
---
so 400-550g for an epic mount on a healthy established server, versus 900g or 800g with the rank 3 bonus.
---
I kinda advocate leveling skinning and mining on a lock just to knock off the dragonscale, bars and arcanite (pay for the cd) portions of the list on a fresh realm.  Once those are acquired drop one of the skills you don't want (mining), grab enchanting and de those 55+ blues you didn't actually need but you needed on for the shards, then drop that or skinning (if you're not playing the devilsaur game) for engineering.
---

If you want to tank go warrior and forget about other people's blaming. I'm in a close position, but I wish I enjoyed warrior PvP...

I think the trees are fine in Vanilla but I think respecs cost too much or they should have had dual spec, **but you have to have a gold sink to get people into the world**, I think other gold sinks should have been there but I don't know what they could have done. Maybe make repairs cost a ton, but that would have had problems to. With respecs you could guesstimate how much gold you needed and prepare for it and get it done by raid night. Repairs would have a nightmare.
---
The only specs who have it "bad" in classic also have it the best. Enhance, Ret. Both can get arcanite reaper and are super strong out the gate, both can get easy blue pvp gear and The Unstoppable Force and be competitive until AQ. 
---
This all may have been intentional design. Both classes are designed to have a low skill ceiling to start playing them. Maybe they are just there so that really casual players have something they can log in with pvp with do some 5 man's with. How many people wouldn't have played without specs like that or BM Hunter?
---
Classes like Elemental (which I have played multiple times on private) really don't have it bad. You raid as 30/0/21 for first few tiers and then you get broken gear for elemental that makes you a god in AQ that you have to respec like other classes do the whole time (mage, rogue, warrior).
---
I think Vanilla done over again you simply remove all gold farming in instances, which lets you lower the gold sink a lot due to people in the world and then you introduce new gold sinks. Perhaps in the form of mount skins and pets.  
---
This would be less effective on pve servers though because you are not fighting for the resources. So I would then make those items cost more on PVE Servers. Perhaps at things like complex guild tabards as well. A guild flag you can where like modern WoW and the flag you get from honor rank.
---
Now you can finally play the game

It very much was. I remember spending an hour using this macro and resummoning until I settled on Geltip for my imp and Bryxia for succ.

Lock is the god class for pvp
---
Why do they both show the exact same IPA?
---
Classic implies Anthem 
---
I have been part of such a guild myself recently and I agree that is how Classic will go, although I think the majority of players will be somewhat in the middle. not 4 hours, not 40 minutes , but more like an hour and a half for BWL.
---
anyway, in 2005/2006 our guild was kinda the same, &gt;80% of our members were adults with jobs, with a desire to waste as little time 
---
as possible.  We just had not discovered all the time saving aspects yet (and some were not always possible, like my example of the Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer.)   
---
Buffing up without summoning warlocks is also a very arduous and annoying process, and since you can't have free accounts in retail far less warlock alts on key places will be available for this service.   
---
So whatever happens, I am pretty sure classic will be a little less streamlined than the current pserver practices 
---
If someone says an-uh-theem-uh, then they are wrong. If someone says uh-nath or ah-nath, neither one is a mistake that's just an accent lol

The Postman Pat theme song rhymes morning with dawning, but you don't see me decrying all of British English.

$/hour is probably less yet it will have its own niche market. People will need the buffs for raids. Grabbing herb / alc will help in your gold making

I'm on the side of shaman, however it turns out the word moved around from a few different cultures, and the pronunciations diverged into the two.

---
&gt;You can access the entire base game and everything up through the end of Legion for just $15, and need only buy BfA when and if you decide to push further into the game.
---
so if I have just vanilla+tbc and then I subscribe then I get the rest of the dlcs between tbc to legion activated?
---
If you plan to raid or pvp seriously you will want engineering.

I never grind CC rep.    ZG is bad enough and more important (enchants).   No time for CC.  It's a pity that I can't use the aq20 set items immediately, but usually there are enough alternatives and eventually you will get enough CC rep through AQ40   runs.
---
Both are strong in all forms of pvp, both are strong at PVE in Classic unless they change the debuff limit to 8 like real vanilla in the first two tiers. If that happens Mage will be better until then at PVE dmg. Lock is still needed due to banishes though. 
---
Biggest differences.
---
Mage = twitchy and I would say if you like fps games more this is the class for you. 
---
Lock = thinking man's class and I would say if you like RTS more this is the class for you. 
---
Mage = utility in premade BG's. You also have burst though when needed.
---
Lock = Also have utility but are more dmg
---
90% of both factions you mean. They just have far better animations, especially casters, and melee for Alliance. 
---

Warlock swoops in on his free mount while you're pleasuring yourself with your skills, triple dots you and leaves with an hk.  Then another waits for your pm at 60 about buying a blackstone ring from them. 
---
Holy priests can’t make gold? Troll post?
---
What about the multitude of pservers that have been active for years? No content has been added to those. 
---
Because Shay-min is the correct pronunciation, Shah-men is an americanised way of saying the word. 
---
\&gt;  **Anyone**  
---
everyone
---
What if the new content was all lame and out of tune with Classic? But everyone would still need to slog through it because you need the best gear to compete in PvP. Could re-kill the game easily.
---
People hate private server content here. They think Private server devs plugged in whatever sounded easiest when it came to (literally uknown) variables like armor and resists. 
---
Why do you like Wotlk over TBC?
---
All things you mentioned you hate in TBC were in wotlk in addition to a dead world after the 1st month since everyone could stay in dalaran.
---
People no longer talked to each other in wotlk since you had the LFG to enter, do and then leave dungeon without saying a single word.
---
Vanilla is unquestionably the best design to hit the nail right in the spot in term of whats important for an mmorpg. however between all expansions to date, TBC is the closest, i would go as far as argue that legion did it better than Wotlk.
---
Also i am not sure we playing the same expansion in tbc as you had the same questing as in vanilla, with dailies to do in order to farm reputation, tons of dungeons that were difficult and rewarding, lots of people going around the world gathering ingredients to craft potions, flasks, items or enchants. What lacked were the scale of the journey questing took you on (questing was more linear and tied to small radius around the quest giver in tbc).
---
These are all the same things you would be doing in vanilla on top of raiding once or a few times a week.
---
Current wow goes like this: levelup in 15-20 hours to reach level cap.
---
Spam LFG normal dungeons to reach a certain ilvl cap.
---
Spam LFG heroic dungeons to reach a higher ilvl cap.
---
Do LFR to get higher ilvl.
---
Do the same raid again on normal with guild.
---
Do the same raid again on heroic with guild.
---
Start progressing through mythic after seeing the same content on 3 previous difficutlies.
---
By the time you start normal raids you will no longer be doing dungeons, only 1 mythic per day.
---
You will be logging in daily to do the world quests for the reward, doing a few BGs and arenas to reach the weekly cap, same for island expedition, same for warfront.
---
All of which you will be doing from the confort of the city hub (expect for the world quests).
---
Compare that to wraith, you level up in half the time you needed in TBC, mission structure is the same as TBC.
---
You reach level cap and sit in dalaran.
---
Spam LFG heroic dungeons to reach a higher ilvl (heroics here were just zerging, tanks dont lose aggro, barely takes damage, all dpsers aoe).
---
Do normal raid on 10 or 25 man to get higher ilvl.
---
do the same raid on heroic 10 or 25 man for higher ilvl.
---
No reputation grind because you just wear a tabard of the faction you want to lvl up the reputation with while doing dungeons.
---
I can't see how TBC design is closer to current wow than to vanilla.
---
I would say it was wotlk where the game design to a hard hit towards making the game a set of tasks instead of a world.
---
 
---
&gt;That dps aura  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;are you talking about oomkin?
---
He's talking about the party-wide 3% crit from LotP talent, given the comparison with rogues. Oomkin does bring a similar thing, tho (physical vs magical crit). 
---
One can hope.
---
Oh i am dying of hype. I want to play classic so badly but i also want it to succeed in attracting more people so that blizzard and all other development studios wake up already and see that the old mmorpg design philosophy was much much better than the crap we have today.
---
In the times of chaos, two factions battled for dominance.
---
Tatary tatary tataRY
---
OMG this is amazing. I never knew about this!!!!! Really hope it works in Classic!
---
Where could I find your guides, kind gentleman?
---
Westfall and loch modan really aren't that bad, basically everything throughout westfall drops shit for quests and you can clear them all out in a optimal route. Loch modan basically has 3 groups of quests, north shit with the rats, the kings defence chain and the eastern quests. Darkshore might be optimal if you're an elf but I don't think it's worth the trip personally. Unless you're going for a speed record 1-20 is pretty quick anyways.
---
WoW is painfully inconsistent with their pronunciations. The "dash" in "Bal'a dash malanore" is pronounced with an American "eh" by one NPC voice, and with a British "ah" by another. Blaming it on in-lore accents is also a weak argument, because it is exclusively spoken by people who lived in a small country for many generations.
---
but where is Westfall?
---
Blood elf? This is a classic forum bud. Even in tbc 90% of horde players didn't play female blood elves so there goes your theory. I actually like it that way it is, all the kiddos and weird role players tend to roll ally which means horde side is always better. 
---
I found it equally funny and cringe. A weird feeling indeed.
---
Shamans are essentially bulky grass types with good coverage moves.
---
You can pass on Edgemaster's all you want. I'll be pressing need.
---
Meanwhile, Horde's basically forced to play as an Orc female so it doesn't feel like you're playing a Quasimodo simulator  =P
---
Well the crit aura helps justify your presence in a raid.
---
It's still not better than just having an extra mage, but it's something.
---

---
People usually say that priests can farm Dire Maul lashers at a reasonable rate with holy nova. If thats true, you should be good.
---
My accent from a very unique part of Canada, lol.
---
This is honestly something that I look forward to the most about Classic wow. I've always wanted a "main" but have never really had one. I can only play one toon at a time but have cycled between all classes in my history of playing trying to find the "one".
---
I leveled 2 other toons to 55+ before hitting 70 in BC. Not counting the 5 other classes I leveled past 30... By the time I hit 70 WOTLK was almost out and I started playing BC the same month it was released. I don't have the luxury of time even if I wanted to do it again like this. 
---
My problem is that WoW really makes all its toons fairly focused in lore and RPG elements and I really like bits and pieces from different ones.
---
That all being said I really want to find that identity and focus on that one toon in Classic that will represent "me". Right now I'm leaning Warrior :)
---
"Holy Priest which means farming for gold will not be the most optimal."
---
No, holy priest is not the most optimal.
---
You can't compare them to the farm potential of a good mage, warlock or Hunter.
---
But they are by far the best of the healers to farm.
---
How do Tanks and Healers Farm Gold/consumables? also how expensive is raiding, like how many gold you need to raid one day?
---
"You might as well be dating someone who plays Alliance".
---
IIRC the americans used the -ium suffix prior to the british adopting of it.
---
Just play a warlock but "forget" about the demon quests
---
&gt;My only concern will be the inevitable bots that will destroy the market.
---
Pretty sure there was a targeted fish bot ban not too long ago on retail.  This won't be an issue at least for very long in classic. 
---
Vanilla when referring to the original from 2004-2007 and classic when referring to the rerelease conning in the summer of 2019.
---
Why do you recommend a warlock?
---
Could not agree more. Using a video game as an excuse for staying with us is very unhealthy and a sign of a much deeper problem. 
---
I recall that some noob kept harassing me with a charter request, so I quickly created a charter with the same guild name and signed by my other accounts, and formed it, and it worked. So, guild name is reserved when you actually form it.
---
TipsOut can post his patreon link, and people will bring it to the top of the page though

It is true that it is a very interesting site, I looked for why not make a shaman and it is very complete as a guide.

---
First thing that came to my mind. 
---
5Head quite indeed
---
Sounds like Amazon QA
---
I believe they should say something like "Don't worry, Vanilla won't be gone so easy this time"
---
And then, somewhere around AQ patch, they would say "we'll be bringing this server into TBC, and will start a fresh Vanilla server in 2 months"
---
The events leading to his death made sense and fit the lore. Blizzard didn't wreck anything you're just sad that characters can die.
---
To find it cheaper in Vanilla was very unlikely. Towards the end it got a fair bit cheaper though. 
---
idk, because warlock gives more of a "vanilla" feeling. More climate.
---
I think it was added in TBC, and it would only reroll the random name, not actually let you rename it.
---
I'm going to 9roudly take 4 months to get to 60

felhuntard
---
I was thinking about priest being a pain until level 12 when you can get a quest reward wand from Westfall (alliance) and then read your guide and thought I could level enchanting enough to make a wand  - THEN saw you need a skill of 75 to make one? I guess when everyone is new on a new server, these enchanting crafted wands are basically going to be unavailable? 
---
Not just that. TBC also broke the consistency of WOW, by splitting the leveling process into two separate "acts".
---
In my opinion, TBC would be much better, if you started at level 58 or something, just like how it worked with DKs.
---
They mean the same thing so it's doesn't matter.
---
That API works for ages in Vanilla.
---
Check this 2006 year vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRqJkTnrmHQ

Dont make excuses! Just take the results. That video is from 1.12.1, you see debuffs and damage, you know damage reduction formula, you see how much armor he got, you see armor red debuffs stack additively in Vanilla.
---
You can not like it, but thats reality.
---
Same

No but no one compares to hunters/locks/mages. So your in the same boat as everyone else. Raid food isn't really where the money is at but yes cooking and fishing makes money.

---
Not sure about world firsts but as others have said, there's quite a few guilds already planning for week 2 MC clears (week 1 isn't realistic), it just takes too long for the slower classes to get to 60 and any semblance of gear in a single week (ie tanks and healers)
---
Yes. Model update in window. 
---
back when Collegehumor was good
---
Recently I tried druid tanking in pserver. I am also main guardian in retail. I have to say that I was really disappointed with Vanilla feral tank. Back in vanilla I played mainly resto druid and enha shaman. I thought when Classic releases I try out feral tank but I just can't. It was dead boring.
---
I am sadly also quite on the edge if I just roll shaman in Classic. Overall something in Vanilla druid doesn't feel right.  I propably will go with healing any ways but shaman as healer seems so much more fun currently with totems and all their spells.
---
Think of it like Coke.  Currently it's Coca Cola Classic.  When it first came out, it was just Coca Cola.  And there was Vanilla Coke in there too.  And Cherry Coke and Coke with Lime and Diet Coke and...
---
I don't know where I was going with this but I didn't get there.
---
No. Whether you farm or not, you still lose the same amount of gold. If you farmed 600g worth of items and use them instead of selling, you lost 600g just the same. 
---
Sleeper op gold making 
---
as a paladin little choice because i don't want to be a short burly dwarf
---
and perception will be fun because i dislike rogues
---
You can't quite run in and Explosive Trap after a Feign Death because if even one of those 50 enemies resists Feign Death you fail to cast it, then Volley is an expensive area spell that does mediocre damage while our poor pet isn't even doing any area damage at all unless you brought a Gorilla. 
---
Moving for Hunters isn't fun either, we have to stop to cast Aimed Shot, Auto Shot and Multi Shot.
---
I wouldn’t reference Youtubers as a source of infallible knowledge. I mean they don’t have a real job to start with. 
---
&gt;Priest probably isn't much better. Dot, smite, smite, wand, repeat.
---
If Holy... I had a blast on my Shadow priest.
---
To roll oceanic and risk low population or go for a us server that is my question
---
Blink on R is the only way
---
Would love if dungeon maps are included in classic.
---
Blizzard confirmed the Vanilla release during Summer, what a lovely new btw. prepare your usb fan!
---
Please.  Enlighten me.  I’m all ears.
---
Probably similar to my job where you only get leave when you ask for it so i end up with 6-8 weeks of it and they tell me to bloody take some
---
It's quite big question and I bet no one knows yet what happens. I would like them to stay in Vanilla. Maybe bring completely new raids? Something they wanted to create back in 2004 but just couldn't. Or just keep things as they were and let us go back when ever we feel like it.
---
I see huge problems with TBC and WotLK servers. First of all where does it end? Are we going to do rewind of WoW's history? Another thing is that I really don't want us have like four versions of WoW (Classic, TBC, WotLK, Live).. it would be just way too much. I also don't want them to eventually move on so Classic stops exists because it turns into TBC.
---
For me the easiest way would just keep Classic as it is. People could come and go and no matter if you are away for month or year, you don't loose too much and there is no "Returning player, what's going on" questions.
---
Was going to go with that, but True Faith Vestments are BiS until at least T2...so have to pick up tailoring for sure.  Might pick up herbing though as the other.
---
With all CD's I would prefer a frost mage 1v2.
---
Polymorph, environmental control and mobility is going to be key.
---
As a warlock it's a lot more "luck" involved and depends on the specc and pet.
---
I guess an SL lock can beat anyone with CD's. But there are not many SL locks walking around because they are subpar in anything but wpvp and dueling.
---
Seen this on YouTube.  Need at least a 6k mana pool and popping power infusion every pull which is on a 3 min CD.  Doable, but lots of downtime.
---
Broken tooth was normalized in 1.9, allegedly
---
Fish tedious and boring as fuck in Vanilla.  I don’t mind it though...just hoping others are lazy and there is little competition.
---
Also a very good point. If you want a group for 5 man's as a druid you can always tank it.
---
Reminds me of the Rurikar time gnome videos, same guy who made the “jimmy the gnome mage” vid
---
Thing is, you are probably gonna be late. The fastest people will be 60 1-2 weeks from launch tops and start generating insane gold through unfixed (muh no changes) methods. If you take the normal 1-3 months to level, getting epic mount by 60 should be a joke if you choose  the right professions (herbalism), and possibly even with wrong professions (not herbalist) because the inflation will be crazy.
---
I hope they don't make "expansion style" with new levels and talents but instead continue Classic. New raids, new areas, new spells, new gear.. all this happening in level 60. Make it kinda on going experience with adding new things.
---
Of course this is quite hard decision. No matter what way they go players will leave. "Modern players" will leave Classic pretty fast after they understand what it is and if they start to change it then "true vanilla bois" are going to leave.
---
&gt;My heart says hunter, but it is really underperforming in pve
---
&gt;but only want to do the necessary things pve wise and orient more on the bgs / world pvp life.
---
What the fuck?  Am I reading that wrong or did you just say you don't want to be a hunter because post BWL they slide on the dps logs compared to the status quo yet you only want to do the bare minimum in pve and focus on pvp, where hunters excel?  
---
Roll a hunter, too many potential locks this time around.   Locks need to be one of the most under-represented classes again.  And if you roll mage you're going to be sitting there in the WSG on sheep and decurse duty getting your shit pushed in by the hunter with the 100% uptime on viper sting until you've exhausted your crystal, pot the mana channeling thing you do that i can't think of right now and then he's going to put his pet on you just enough to keep you oom and in combat the rest of the bg and you're going to hate your life.  
---
&gt;Also, I am looking to play on a *redacted*
---
We call it tight's rope around here.
---
Please play lock
---
It might be at the end of summer :D imagine - August 29th or something.  :D would hate Blizzard for that. 
---
Hell yeah! Since 2005
---
Unless there's a priest or shaman who knows that they can dm/purge your shield.
---
This exploits the fact that pirate servers let you reset an instance and teleport to the start of it, instead of being kicked out to your hearthstone location.
---
Unless they deliberately make #changes to enable this behaviour in Classic, which would be weird, you will have to run out of the instance to reset it, die and ghost run back, or go to your hearth location and run back in. All of these make it less efficient as a farming method.
---
It might still be the best way to farm, time will tell, but it's not going to be as good.
---
How does stance dancing a fear work?
---
Alright! In Sweden we have X amount of days with paid leave that we can use per year. I have 30 on my current job but 25 is the standard. So 38 days "left" sounds amazing haha :D 
---
350-400 more like. I remember getting 250ish when we upgraded to ADSL2+ in BC or Wrath and it felt amazing.
---
blessing of salvation
---
Vanilla has a huge alliance bias which probably is the explanation. Your comparing apples to oranges.
---
Warrior leveling is hard but not slow 
---
Ohhh, this I did not know. Makes sense.
---
I have read that undead are the pick for PvP for the WoTF racial trait. I will be rolling a Gnome Lock though as Gnomes Rule!!! Combination of Engineering and Escape artist is too much fun. 
---
Why do you say that ?
---
That’s honestly a pretty big deal as far as the new races went.  It makes way more sense to have their zones go 1-58 than 1-20 and then having to level through a bunch of content you already saw just to keep HFP from becoming too crowded.  Same goes for DK ending at 58 instead of 68, or Cata’s new leveling world not taking you to 78 instead of 58, and then having to do the last two expansions.

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**  Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Contact me on discord ( Kyte#1707 )  for more information! 
---
Fucking awful, it was my first real character and my first real mmo (other than just rolling a character to see their starting skills), i struggled as an adorable kitty to get to max level. Then at 59 one of the officers in the guild whispers me and says hey can't wait for you to hit 60! we need somebody to innervate the priests! It shattered my world Not only could I not DPS or tank, my heals were so bad they only brought me to give the priests mana and MOTW? That was the day I learned about metas. I rerolled and that druid sat at 59 until TBC came out.
---
Personally I've never tried making gold with Fishing and Cooking ( usually would cook for myself ) but it should be somewhat viable. As for the bot situation you are most likely going to have a fair bit of competition on the market.
---
If you're going to be rolling Tailoring / Enchanting you can make some decent gold from there especially at launch. Currently on i'm able to make some decent gold with that combo just by selling enchants, bags, and crafted blues/greens.
---
Another great combo would be Alchemy/Herbalism. Selling all the extra herbs and transmute cd is usually steady gold income.
---
Hope I was of some help \*\^\_\^\*
---
Usually not, but if I am group leader, that's the rule I use to avoid any kind of drama. 
---
he means the dual wield fury main tank meme, watch some skarm tank videos on youtube
---
I don´t agree that you should use Lfm without having a group. This is not effective communication. Also mind that while still leveling, tanks and healer can and will roll on dps gear because that is the reason they visit a pre 60 dungeon. Like everyone else basically.
---
Also what I missed is that upon gathering outside the dungeon, it is  a nice touch to share your related quests. Some of them are all over the world. 
---
Maybe on nost, in classic which will have 1/4 of the population I'm not so sure.
---
Threat management as locks is a nightmare when you're geared, even on Ally. How do Horde locks even dps i wonder...
---
TL;DR. You will not be able to do both on high end appart if you play 10/12 hours a day. If you have time, go for pvp, you will gear fast in the beginning but achieving R14 is a huge achievement by itself.
---
Sorry to be a bit Harsh, but I think you are a bit delusional to be able to farm high end PVE AND PVP. In vanilla, if my memory is good, only 3% of the players had access to naxxramas and I think only 0.1% finished naxx (numbers to verify... it might be less). It’s not retail. It’s not easy. To go into naxx you need at least 2 to 3 hours of component farming for a single night.
---
And if your guild is on try hard on a content, you will need to be specced properly. 
---
Plus, remember, you have 40 men to stuff, so achieving a full BIS takes months (assuming you farm naxx).
---
Now for the pvp part, from R13 to R14 you need to be in the top 0.1% of your faction for 3 consecutive weeks. Meaning playing 8/10 hours minimum.
---
So appart if you plan to play 10/12 hours a days, everyday, forget doing both high end at the same time.
---
Tbh I’ll be in no rush to hit 60. What I’m really looking forward to is shitposting insane amounts of garbage in general chat.
---
Paul oakenfold gained thousands of followers from this montage 
---
Looks like it. There wasn’t many warlord shamans with hand of rag in the world at that time. 
---
I am source FM for 4 years and had this montage on repeat. 
---
This whole discussion ignores the crush blows mechanic. You are always at risk of a crushing blow if you do not have a shield which means on some fights the MT will just die. No tank of any note will be duel-wield, if you do your healers will hate you. A good tank will gear to ensure they have high threat output but prioritising enough hit, but you have lower damage in defensive stance which you have to be in to get the threat modifier. You can't use some DPS abilities in defensive stance so would have to continually stance dance. This is some private PS server logic bullshit that exists because the bosses on PS servers do not hit correctly. Wait til classic is launched and see how quickly arguments like this are settled when the tanks die near instantly without a shield.
---
sekiro, classic wow, ep ix, lotr series
---
It depended on the patch and the rest of the gear. If you tried to kill Ragnaros in the early patches you needed the fire resist, not necessarily because things would oneshot you but because healers ran out of mana due to raid DPS being so much lower than it was in the later patches. Much lower tank threat was a major contributor to this.
---
My life is a lie
---
There will be competition, but i don't think world first will be a thing, mostley beacuse there is not glory in being the first to kill a 14-15 year old boss first. The real world firsts have already been gotten buy guilds in 2004-2006
---
All of the bosses with fears either have a consistent cool down or a cast animation. The warrior tank quickly switches to Berserker Stance and activates Berserker Rage and quickly switches back to defensive stance, leaving themselves immune to the fear.
---
But it's out of z-engine environment, right?
---
Best for montages maybe, SM/Ruin is the primo premade build, and SL is way better 1v1 though
---
My first MMO was 2d isometric Tibia. I was 11 years old and asked my sister what LOL meant. She thought it stood for "Lots of love" 11 year old me was very confused why people typed it out so much !
---
Lots of RS2 players were literally illiterate. We’re talking about kids under 10 and kids under 10 with English as a second language. 
---
So what you get are people with low levels of English reading combined with low frequency words, some of which are made up entirely. It’s a disaster waiting to happen.
---
Say it like you're from Jamaica and you'll get somewhere.
---
Great stuff.  Reading Warcraft novels right now,  will have to read this too! :) 
---
Hi Captain!
---
Do you have some .zmd mods to share?
---
Thanks
---
backlash was added in tbc iirc
---
&gt; Now you can argue that buffs can be applied without having effect. That is indeed correct, however, that would completely surrender the mechanic of the "more powerful spell being active". Ill gladly remove this point, but then we need a new premise.
---
It could be due to the secondary effect of some spells. For example **(I'm not saying this is the case, I'm just using it as an example)** the armor reduction of Faerie Fire might not stack with Sunder Armor but because the spell also prevents the target from stealth it'll land in order to apply that effect.
---
Fishing up elemental fire in Molen Core can be a good way to make gold while 'killing trash' ;)
---
I think your vision of a classic launch is skewed way too much by pservers. The congestion will be closer to BfA launch than to K3 launch because of sharding I believe. 
---
I was speedleveling BfA launch, I think I got to Vol'dun first on my med/low pop server but once I got there it was full of speedlevelers from all servers. So I was worried I might stay in the zone with all the speedlevelers but that wasn't true. We all got into different shards and by questhub 3/4 I was completely alone. That's like how all the tryhards log in asap at classic launch and it will be hard to do the first quests but after a while you get sharded with people creating their character 5 min+ later and you won't have much competition with those. I think after you leave the level 1-5/6 zone you are pretty much alone.
---
Another thing is, I was the only one on my server that really practiced their route on the beta before launch. It's not a very high pop server but it's also not empty, there are currently 17 guilds that are raiding mythic. So while you compete with a ton of speedlevelers on pservers, on a single classic server there won't be many. There might not be any sharding in the 10-20 zones but you will still be pretty much alone there if you have practiced on pservers.
---
So all in all I think there is no need for a competition free route after the 1-5/6 zone.
---
Do you remember Lard the mailbox bear?
---
mage is stronger by itself while warlock brings more team utility
---
It’s a play on School Of Necromancy.  
---
What if my friends aren't 12?
---
I honestly think that depends on how well the progression scene does.  I’d like to actually play through cata at some point, but even with the content still being available, doing it on live is ridiculous due to leveling changes, or at least it was because I haven’t touched live in years.  
---
I’ve been of the opinion that restoring the 1.12 values hasn’t been as critical as just restoring the old world and making it relevant again.  The no changes crowd has been pretty, let’s say “vocal”, about how things should go despite it being demonstrated they are really more interested in how private servers were implemented over accuracy.  I don’t think the changes that came with 2.0 or 3.0 were bad as far as class balance or reducing warriors’ monopoly on raid tanking.  
---
I’d argue the critical issue here is being able to play WoW with other people during the expansion you want.  Having people interested in a project 60 type of game just doesn’t work out when you have to share the server with level 100 people, and no server has been designated for the effort that doesn’t involve a years old forum post for a guild that fell apart months ago.  
---
I read the hunters guide and I think they underrate how important are the tracks while leveling. The difference between trying to find a mob for 5 min and walk straight into it is... 5 minutes.
---
Priest or whatty?
---
RemindMe! 
---
Adsl+2 was BC for me
---
But why does BoM and Battle shout stack then? :) 
---
Paladin would become the ultimate troll class, bubbling allies to stop them farming and ruin their day.
---
Looking for an NA Horde guild on a PvP sever with an emphasis on raiding. The catch is that my current account is locked to the Americas and Oceania, but I am on a temporary job assignment in the EU for a few years. In a perfect world, I would like to find a NA raiding guild that raids during the afternoons EST (perhaps for people that work nights). However, I suspect this is going to be unlikely, so I have settled for trying to get as many alchemy recipes and enchants as possible on my shaman and trying to help a more progression oriented guild with these professions. Message me if it seems like either one of these roles has a spot in your guild. Thanks!!!
---
Yeah thinking napkin math off the top of my head it probably costs you an extra 20 minutes of walking back, but you can mitigate that by doing north-&gt;east runs, doubling the number of instances you do between ghost walks, and its still considered one instance.
---
Damn another Tibia player.
---
'Lots of love' your way my friend.
---
That's a fair point. If you don't play Classic like it's a job, prices will probably already be high on herbs and such when you reach 60.
---
You're missing out on a good pair of balls.
---
the c is silent right? 
---
But then they never put their credibility on the line by saying HOW BIG of a discrepancy there is between the two, because it would reveal their image of classic being even less reliable than a "classic lookalike" project that a team of people worked on and used community gathered research to help authenticate. The people running the server probably played wow.. 
---
That is eeeeeeeeeevil.
---
I remember actually enjoying dungeons again at the start of Cata.
---
Fuckin' casuls ruin everything.
---
Rushing to 60 in a week sounds like a great way to shoot around IF waiting for enough people to level up to do dungeon runs with, too
---
Oh, I misread the post, but yeah, I know that indeed you need to be out of combat entirely to do traps.  Seems weird to me a raid would handle suppression room like that, but maybe I forgot something about that area, so hm, that sucks.
---
But oh god, yeah, I totally forgot Auto Shot has something like a cast time.  How did it work again?  I'm pretty sure you didn't need to treat your entire attack speed like a cast-time spell, right?  You just had to stay still for half a second when it was time to attack, right?  Or is it that the "cast" paused while moving but resumed where it left off once you stopped moving?  Or both?
---
I was judging you by your post and didn’t know how famous you are among YouTube streamer exports. *applause*
---
You’re right I overlooked the point that he doesn’t want to specc into prot at all and still want to tank. Then warrior is definitely better as paladin.
---
But still, your whole point of how people think and might accept a prot pally in their low level dungeon is situational at best... still more an opinion than a fact. Having mail/plate, a Shield and an Aggro ability eas enough for 90%+ groups I experienced. If you don’t put effort in tanking as a paladin you might suck and wipe a lot and people will stop playing with you. But that’s also true for a healing Retradin.
---
Sry for keeping up the lazy writing.
---
The research behind the latest cores is very well done and I think they've done a remarkable job considering the size and complexity of the task.
---
They already did: 
---
"We are not sure what comes after Classic. We focus on Classic first, and then think about what comes after."
---
u mean that build? 
---

The hype has grown on me the past few months as well. It is a really strange hype compared to a "new" release, since there is little anticipation for any kind of reveal. I know exactly what to expect. What I am really hyping about is what new adventures I will experience. Not in the sense of "game content exploration", since I am well past that magic, but more in what people I will meet and what kind of shenanigans we will muster up. 
---
Looks like I will be playing an Orc Hunter, and sieging down Southshore is on the bucket list. Lok'tar ogar!
---
Attending guild RP event. 
---
One minute in wanted my character to laugh at another’s joke. 
---
Accidentally missed the slash on a lol. 
---
Just said lol in normal \say
---
Guild chat erupts.
---
Well then get the goddamn bear.
---
SS, die, rez, continue dps
---
Vanilla WoW is what he played in the mid 00s, Classic WoW is what we'll soon be playing. They're two different things
---
It's possible that it may end up being more efficient to just cut out East entirely for mages. The dogs and insects in North are good cash, and you can just run out and reset.
---
I guess we'll find out how everything works in summer.
---
As a pvp main, we often complained that "all the devs play horde" and the game was clearly biased in their favor
---
I would attribute this more to Hanlon's razor: Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity. When TBC came out, they said ok what can we do to make this awesome, flying mounts? Sound awesome, players have been asking why flight masters get flying mounts and where griffon mounted dwarves are since the game released they will eat that shit up. We did, I loved the idea of it, I worked tirelessly to get the money up to get that flying mount. It wasn't until later that I realized the consequences to such an addition were. Same thing with meeting stones and LFG, they weren't trying to fuck up the game they just though hey if we make this less tedious so people can focus more on the content thats good! Most of us agreed and went right along with it until the community adapted to the changes and became more and more jaded/toxic. 
---
Please don't. I was just getting over my ptsd.
---
It's spongebob, my dude. It has universal appeal unless you're a miserable bastard.
---
**Super Best Friends - Alliance US (EST) PVE - Family/Raiding**
---
**Synopsis:** Super Best Friends was originally created in TBC to house real life friends in our new leveling experience. During a Zul'farak run, where my prot paladin had a newly-acquired Flurry Axe, I impressed some randoms with my 1337 Dps and invited them into the guild. This bloomed and soon we had many friends of friends of friends! Now I come back 12 years later, having tracked down a number of those friends and decided to try my hand again at running a guild.
---
**Focus:** Leveling and PVE - While we don't frown upon PVP, and frankly I probably enjoy it the most out of our team, we will mostly be focusing on raids, using a system of DKP which fits our playstyle.
---
**Playstyle:** Casual/Raid Focused - Let's be honest, we're not in college anymore, and most of have full time lives, working or taking care of our families, or both. I know I have a daughter on the way, and plenty of us have responsibilities. However, we are all WoW veterans and have a good understanding of Vanilla raiding. **Wed/Thurs 6pm-10pm(11pm if progression) EST.**
---
**Are we a good fit?** - We are a guild with realistic outlooks towards the game. We all want to raid and enjoy the magic that is Vanilla WoW together, but within the appropriate scheduling of our real lives. We are also older now, which isn't a requirement, but understand that most of the guild to start will be around 30+. We are not going to have squabbles over nonsense, be relaxed while enjoying what the game has to offer. We will joke and kid around, but if anyone starts to bother another, it will be dealt with appropriately.
---
If Interested Contact Me Directly. Thank you for reading this post. 
---
what seal is best used as paladin when leveling? what's the rotation, and how is leveling as protection? does it work with this plan aswell?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent Here you go, mate. Say goodbye to a productive life.
---
You can be whatever spec and build you want to be.. except balance druid.  For real though, when it comes to dungeons or casual raiding it doesnt matter.  You most likely wont be a competitive raider if you aren't one of the 5 or 6 dps specs, but who cares.  You might end up a tier behind the competitive raiders but that was the majority of players back then.
---
I lol’d
---
I'm mostly sure Player Z has to hit the monster or heal the party member, basically anything to get on the monster's aggro list, but otherwise, yes.
---
Sweet. Didn’t know that was possible.
---
&gt;How do Horde locks even dps i wonder...
---
[This](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23001) and [This](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21647) look helpful.
---
Fucking WotF!
---
Stuff this bloody QLD heatwave. At this stage I'm equally excited about the cold weather as I am about Classic. 
---
UD warlock is either so much 2006, or you are making a drakedog tribute. 
---
You would want to be an orc for PvP and the actual game lore. You don't roll horde warlock for competetive raid DPS anyways. 
---
I think i'll need to go ahead and unsub. These circlejerk shitpost's are getting too much now. See you all at in the summer!
---
Pally epix mount quest materials and quests itself cost like 600-700g depending on the server situation. Lets say blizzard did the right progression and added that the same timeframe as they did in vanilla. Fuck no its not worth the wait.
---
Why is it weak?
---
20% more focus means 20% more focus dump DPS. If we go with assumption that pet is 50% of total DPS for leveling hunter, and focus dump is 25% of pet DPS, then it would be like 2.5% overall DPS boost for 2 points? Kind of reasonable.
---
I think after 40 one would want to respec out of imp cheetah and 30% pet speed - because of mount and pet sprint, so there are free points.
---
Orc Warlock is way better though
---
Warrior. Although in WC3 he had reincarnation so I guess he could be seen as a bit of a hybrid. WoW he is 100% Warrior.
---
I think they will announce the release date in GDC 2019 (18th-23rd) if they still on track for early summer release.
---
&gt; This will be bigger than the recent retail WoW world first event.
---
Ahh, yes that event that had Method streaming live from a dedicated Red Bull centre? 
---
Classic will probably have some private server community guilds who nobody outside of the community has heard of - no sponsors, no stream audience base - nothing
---
how do you value weapon speed in mainhand vs dps.
---
i just had to made that descision while leveling.
---
- 2.8 speed, 15 dps
---
or
---
- 1.7 speed, 22 dps
---
at which point does the dps matter more?
---
I do fully agree with you that it's more fun without all the addons, but my point is you make it out to be a retail problem. I don't think it is, I think it's a *player* problem. Retail simply have a lot more mechanics, and they are more unique. This of course means there are more "help" addons, but that is only *relative* to the fact that retail has more mechanics.
---
For vanilla generally boss design is more simple, but even so I'd say there are addons for any challenge. And if the retail community makes it "mandatory", then so will the vanilla raiding community. Often this comes because people don't want to "waste time" wiping, they just want to win fast and efficiently - same goes for vanilla.
---
I will say, I have had a bit better experience than you with retail. Never gotten much hate for not using addons, but sucks you have.
---
Lastly, I do hope vanilla might bring some guilds to differ due to the nature of vanilla. I have some hope that it brings in some players that play more in style of an old RPG, exploring and trying things. From forum posts it seems these type of people are out there and will probably just need to find each other and group up for their content.
---
Personally, I plan to go no addons that trivialize mechanics. 
---
Enigma didn't ruin the game as much as people thought it did though, but yeah duped and buffed items sucked dick. 
---
Is Exorcism really a waste of gold as a human leveling through Duskwood and later the plaguelands? It seemed quite powerful for me. 
---
Tanking without a shield in Vanilla can be done in certain conditions, even in raids. But those conditions only apply AFTER heavily overgearing the content, and NEVER before that.
---
Like tanking MC or ZG with a raid in full T2-T3 or equivalent, or even tanking Naxx after you have it on farm. The entire raid have to overgear the content...and even in this conditions, tanking with a shield is superior.
---
No Fury Warrior, EVER, tanked raid bosses in Vanilla, during progression. Many tried...they all failed. Simply because the gear that they HAVE to use to generate enough threat, is wide-open to crits and crushing blows.
---
Fury tanking is a private server thing. It won't be a thing in Classic. Even in this video, the "tank" is taking MASSIVE damage, and he survives only because the healers are supergeared, and can afford to throw big, mana expensive heals.
---
What exactly private servers have, that Fury Warriors are able to tank raid bosses?
---
Well, for first, flasks are plenty. Secondly, the price for a flaks is irrelevant on private servers, because gold on private servers can be bought, and even if nobody would buy gold, on a server with 4-5 times the size of a Vanilla server, the economy is much more fluid, and making gold is not an issue. For private server players that played Vanilla for years, making gold is easy. And they will have plenty of gold to buy loads of consumables, flasks, have the best enchants, etc.
---
Thirdly, the armor debuff stacking on private servers allows a Fury Warrior to generate more threat compared to a Prot Warrior, because Fury Threat is like 80% damage, while Prot Threat is like 80% talents, skill and spells. Once Classic hits, the armor debuffs won't stack, and the Fury Warrior will lose a good chunk of it's damage, hence threat, removing the ONLY REASON why he would tank in the first place.
---
Fourthly, world buffs. The world buffs allow a Fury Warrior to increase its threat more than a Prot Warrior that have the same world buffs. One wipe tho, or just one MT death, and the Fury Warrior advantage goes to drain...while the Prot Warrior won't lose as much survivability / threat as the Fury Warrior loses after death.
---
There are just too many thing on private servers that allow a meta that WILL NOT exist in Classic. 
---
And I am not even going to go onto Feral Druid tanks here...poor guys, having a blast on private servers, always claiming that "people in Vanilla were stupid" and that Feral Druids are actually good tanks.
---
Comes Classic, everyone will UNDERSTAND why Druids and Fury Warriors will NOT GOING TO TANK RAID BOSSES...unless their entire guild raid is 2 tiers above what they tank (like AQ40 guilds might have a Druid/Fury Warr tank MC/Ony/ZG in Classic, ot Naxx guilds might have a Druid/Fury Warrior tank SOME BWL bosses).
---
But during progression and doing one tier bellow raids will be 100% EXCLUSIVELY tanked by 31 points Protection Warriors.
---
Ya, always nice that the servers of the EU were in the Netherlands back in the day. So I had a ping of 20 tops or something. When something spawned, I would be first.
---
Can confirm it was VC on Frostmane at least. DM usually was Dire Maul after it came out.
---
A rogue with the correct build will demolish warrior DPS in the lower tier dungeons and raids. Warriors however will outshine them in BWL and further.
---
But it's not THAT big of a difference and most warriors will be needed as tanks anyway.
---
Thanks!
---
This.
---
Where is the money at?  Pots/Flasks?

Even C'thulhu's pronunciation is debatable. Lovecraft gave multiple conflicting ways to pronounce it and even at one point in a letter wrote that it was impossible for humans to pronounce it perfectly
---
&gt;The name of the hellish entity was invented by beings whose vocal organs were not like man's, hence it has no relation to the human speech equipment. The syllables were determined by a physiological equipment wholly unlike ours, hence could never be uttered perfectly by human throats ... The actual sound -- as nearly as any human organs could imitate it or human letters record it -- may be taken as something like Khlûl'-hloo, with the first syllable pronounced gutturally and very thickly. The u is about like that in full; and the first syllable is not unlike klul in sound, hence the h represents the guttural thickness.
---
Just a fun tidbit. It's still definitely not "See-thulu"
---
I'd say the opposite, honestly. Lock is way stronger in PvP than a mage at endgame.
---
Man we had MC on farm for a while before I figured out that my tanking rotation should include more skills than just sunder armor, taunt and execute...

Cool story bro

# The Argent Vanguard
---
**DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay**
---
* **Region:** EU
---
* **Server Type:** RP
---
* **Faction:** Alliance
---
* **Play Times:** Varied.
---
* **Priorities:** Leveling &gt; Roleplay &gt; Dungeons
---
* **Particular Rule:** Willingness to engage in Roleplay.
---
* **Contact:** discordapp.com/invite/BGQ4Z9e
---
# Introduction; In-Universe
---
The  Vanguard, commonly known as the ‘Argent Spear’ was originally  created  in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest  corners of  the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over the  years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the  Burning  Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of  the  world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The  Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination  for all  your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
Our  Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events  taking  place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however  that  concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions can’t be   introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We  wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will  often  spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs, even   outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
If you want druids to heal you need to accept that they need healing gear.

**Scholomance**
---
The Scholomance (Romanian: Şolomanţă, Solomonărie) was a fabled school of black magic in Transylvania, which was run by the Devil. The school enrolled about ten students to become the Solomonari. Courses taught included the speech of animals and magic spells. One of the graduates was chosen by the Devil to be the Weathermaker and tasked with riding a dragon to control the weather.

Except the druid already moonfired it 
---
&gt; I also think it's not really worth fighting about that because ultimately we will get what Blizzard gives us.
---
Very much true.
---
I would've loved to see some classic wow "re-imagined". Classic for me at least is all about the community. Slow gear progression and PvP. Keep those pillars and infuse it with stuff they've done right in later expansions.
---
1 Button rotations as a mage or warlock are so outdated, that I couldn't play one even if I wanted to. Same goes for bosses with 1 or 2 abilites, where current trash mobs are more demanding.
---
I don't want to see all the classes being samey, but I also don't want to see classes or specs in the gutter. And even though it was that way back in the day, it's really weird for me to want that back for the sake of it, instead of a "good" game.
---
I always like to point out that the blizz forums where filled with upset people, who demanded changes (that came in TBC for a reason). Most of which still have solid ground 15 years later.
---
But wait and see it is, it'll be fun no matter what. But then again I might  switch back to retail after a while, because they share the same subsription (pretty smart of them tbh.)
---
Orc is better for PvP due to Stun Resistance. There's more stuns out there than Fear, Seduce or Sleep, and Stun Resistance is always up. 
---
that's where this topic started. 
---
Hahah so lucky my country doesn't have special realms. English servers are better, my opinion
---
That makes sense, so basically just a quick macro to change, pop, change back
---
People seem to forget there was also /who in the day. Where you could find a full group within a few minutes of wispering people.
---
If you kill a mob 2 times faster, he only do half damage to the 2 of you, if you spread it out its 1/4 of the damage on you so you dont have any downtimd anymore.
---
Also synergy between class, if a war and a heal team up for example, the war can take more mobs, take more damage so get more rage and do more damage.
---
Well said.
---
I think a lot of the private server experts are in for a huge shock when they find out that all the stuff they take as gospel is completely inaccurate.
---
What are we looking at in the link. I see High Warlord that’s rank 14 right?
---
Do you need locks for summoning? For the standard buff run my guild does, we don’t use locks and it’s actually frowned upon if you need a summon.
---
1) Before raid, set hearth to CH
---
2) Run DM Trib or use a cleared one for the 3 ogre buffs
---
3) Get a mage in DM to port you to SW
---
4) Fly to Westfall, run to ZG Isle
---
5) Log out (can be even a day or two before raid time if you want)
---
6) Log in right at raid time, get ZG buff
---
7) Port to SW, get Ony head buff
---
8) Port to Darn, fly to Felwood, get Songflower as a guild
---
9) All hearth to CH
---
10) Run to AQ, should arrive with still ~100-115 mins on all buffs, about the amount of time it takes to get Cthun down, especially if you’ve pre-cleared Skeram on a previous raid day (Skeram often kills people, which wastes their world buffs, and pre clearing him also increases your chances to get to Cthun with buffs still up)
---
No locks needed
---
I wouldn't do it as a main moneymaker, but I would still level it. 
---
The reason is because when you do pugs, your raid is postponed for an hour, because your MT is stuck in traffic and the likes, you can just hop onto the wyern (if you are horde), fly to Azshara and ride to the Bay of Storms all in about 4minutes.
---
In other words. fishing is an awesome profession to avoid downtime when you can't log out or leave the group for something else, but still want to take in the game world.
---
Pretty much. I had my 3 stances bound to F1-F3 and Berserker Rage on 3 in Berserker stance. Probably missed a fear 3-4 times in as many years. It eventually becomes so automatic you just won't miss.

 &lt;Pride&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild 
---
General Introduction: Welcome to Pride, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times and days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available raid times. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together.

---
Perfect for winter in Australia xxx
---
I have 5 weeks left of vacation + my SO is due next week so i have paternity leave aswell. Classic here we come.
---
I stand corrected. That’s pretty cool.
---
Kinda. I feel the itch, therefore watch quite some guides, PvP videos and stuff like that, which immediately puts me off a bit.  
---
**Everything. is. so. simple.**  
---
All casters have pretty much a 1 button rotation, due to debuff slot limits. (I honestly don't want to count downranking).
---
Enhancer and retri can push a button every 5 seconds while watching autohits.
---
Feral tanks spam maul and swipe.  
---
Only rogues, fury, hunter and powershifting feral dps have something I'd call a rotation that keeps you busy, and that's important, because most bosses won't either.  
---
I feel like it'll be quite boring after the initial hype. **But I'm hoping for the best.**  
---
Quite a good move on blizzards side, to include classic in the retail subscription, I can actually see quite a few people going back to retail that way.
---
We’re not talking about spelling.
---
wotlk is crap 
---
A lot of it is things like deviate fish and deviate delights. It has a much wider base of users.
---
Who said they were infallible?
---
That's brilliant, thank you for sharing this.
---
No...is the pvp rank on the pvp section..check the "crown" drawn,not the usual high warlord drawn that is a helmet with a  aura around.
---
Not text books. I can’t tell you how but typically when someone I know mispronounces a lot of words I find that they don’t read much. I mean novels. It helps you know how to pronounce words because you have seen them in context before.
---
This is straight awful advice. 
---
is there any proof that the boss was level 63?
---
&gt;SotC's primary mechanic—making you swing faster to proc more things—was made completely irrelevant because of   
---
&gt;a broken SoR that wasn't fixed until TBC.
---
Please stop repeating this. SoR proccing effects is NOT a bug. It is an intended design of the Seal from the 1.9 Paladin overhaul. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that the seal proccing effects is a bug. Nothing at all. If you happen to DO have a source for this, please link it.
---
There are however plenty evidence to suggest that the seal is meant to trigger procs. Here's the 1.9 Patch Notes:
---
* Seal of Righteousness - Now does holy damage on every swing. **It can now proc correctly as well.** The Judgement effect has been renamed "Judgement of Righteousness" to differentiate it from the Seal damage in the combat log.
---
* Judgement of Righteousness - The damage of this judgement was increased significantly. This judgement can now trigger procs. The bonus from spell damage items has been increased slightly.
---
Lastly, the seal was changed in TBC to not proc, but that means absolutely nothing. Different expansion means lots of overhauls to every class and it's faulty logic to conclude that just because a particular change was made in patch X, it was supposed to be like this in previous patch Y.
---
It's much more likely that Blizzard simply removed the seals ability to proc in TBC because of the introduction of Seal of Vengeance for Alliance as the primary tanking seal while at the same time making it easier to introduce new items with procs into the game without having to take into account potential balancing issues for SoR, something that was never a concern in Vanilla due to the less streamlined class design and no need to balance the classes around Arena.
---
To summarize, there is simply no evidence that supports the idea that SoR proccing item effects was ever a bug and your ridiculous crusade against Paladins are simply put, pointless.
---
Engaging in fisticuffs. 
---
I've never understood that design decision. Why penalise someone because someone tries to help? Most people probably have no clue of the restrictions.
---
Why not just make it so that once tagged, the mob cannot be attacked by anyone else?
---
Wow, hidrasactum. I played alliance on Argent Dawn back in the day. I remember you winning Tardon’s arena thing? Do I remember you were the servers first r14?
---
We’re talking about people who’s primary language is English. 
---
It would only be the same as casting any buff although multiplied by Defensive Stance, similar idea with Bloodrage/Enrage (Bear Form's).  So sure, technically you're right, but only if no one else did any action at all and only if the Warrior was on all the enemies' aggro list to begin with.  This can be relevant for having to pull over a great a distance, but it's extremely limited.  There's no way you're going to actually keep aggro, let alone get it, with Battle/Demoralizing Shout if people are doing AoE damage or healing you by any meaningful amount.  All you really have is Cleave for "AoE" unfortunately.
---
Had a WoW friend call Burning Steppes: Burning Stee-pees from Vanilla till we quit in MoP. Still get a good chuckle about that today.
---
Hunter starts falling off in late game, so like what 2-3 years from release? Not sure why everyone’s hyping hunter to be some trash class, it’s fun and with a consistant rotation you’ll still do competetive dps first 3 stages of the game. If you really like hunter, play hunter my man.
---
ehhh, I am not sure about this one. There are bosses that are actually over-tuned in PS.
---
People are weird.
---
Incel much?
---
According The Free Dictionary "shaymin" is not a mispronunciation of the word "shaman", despite the common pronunciation is "shah-man".
---
[https://www.thefreedictionary.com/shaman](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/shaman)
---
Similar to melee, tomato, potato.
---
Work out and stay drunk the whole weekend fam
---
The secret to happiness is found in hoes and haichus
---
Best course of action is let Classic rock for a few years and see it it’s well received and a success from a financial point of view . Also, it makes more sense to hang back and see Classics reception before diving into recreating another era of a past WoW era.
---
And if they were to get rid of flying mounts and other quality of life changes from possible future BC and Wrath servers, than those aren’t “authentic” BC or Wrath experiences. If you are okay with that, then you should be okay with changes to Classic. 
---
If they do have future BC servers, they should allow each Classic Vanilla level 60 character one server switch to a BC enabled realm (which would be a new realm created months in advance of BC launch). 
---
As much as I want BC servers, I think they should have Classic run at least twice as long as Vanilla’s life run before any BC servers.
---
yes , I think im going to play a hunter , regardless of the fact that they fall behind
---
Lard was a staple of the barrens. I miss that good boy.
---
Except they don't mean the same thing. Classic refers specifically to the game Blizzard will "soon" release. So you can't really use "Classic" to refer to the game back in the 00's. Vanilla can be used to refer to that old game. It could be argued that Vanilla can technically also be referring to Classic since the name Vanilla origins from not having any expansions - thus making it an umbrella term.
---
Joana has said he'll put out some more alliance guide in time for beta, which would be good.  
---
A couple of us have also been working on an alliance side speed levelling guide for the past couple of years, and that is getting closer to being complete. I haven't had a chance to look but my colleague has put in a 1-20 for all the non NE starter races.
---
Basically 3/4 endgame hunter weapons happen to have an attack timer where you don't want to clip auto shots for max dps.
---
So you squeeze in our active shots between auto shots. Most hunters have an attack timer addon so you can see when to move between shots, and you only ever press an active shot right after an auto shot.
---
There was a post on the viability of fishing made yesterday.  Good in depth video.  I'm just pooping right now but I'll post you the link when I get to work.  
---
Lol cuz warriors aren’t a tedious grind the entire time
---
the truth and nothing but the truth
---
not needed, but all that traveling is very annoying if you do it often, so that kind of guilds tend to speed things up by parking extra warlocks at strategic places:   (AQ entrance,  Felwood buff,  ZG isle). Plus you get an additional 10-15  minutes out of your DM buffs.  
---
Yes i was :),the first HW,and yep i won Tardon´s first event,also i reached that rank because i didn´t stop by one week ,then i took that deserved break :),who was you on alliance side? 
---
That's why I opened my comment with that specific line.  
---
Still, even on NA servers, there might be players who are not native English speakers, so I would not be 100% certain.
---
Username checks out 
---
Sorry, a false-friend mistake on my behalf.  
---
To me, "spelling a word" is not only listing the letters that make that word up, but also pronunciation of such a word.  
---
Forgive me, it's a heritage of bad educational setup.  
---
I will update my comment, what I meant is mispronunciation, not misspelling.  
---
As per the actual spelling of words, usually native speakers are the worst (regardless of the specific language being taken into account.)
---
I don't even know what BFA is! 😁
---
the good thing is, the game is so much more than raiding. personally i dont care about the raids so much.
---
Yes, but most of us use  the synonyms like cuddlemuffin  or hunnybunny so the word gnome isn't as common  
---
Loot isn’t the sole driving force behind classic WoW compared to a looter shooter, where loot is such an important and fundamental part of the gameplay loop that it is literally in the name of the genre. Borderlands 2, Destiny 2, Warframe, Division 2 are all examples of games that gave loot properly and where you felt properly rewarded. If you expand out into games like D3 post loot 2.0 and PoE you see the same thing in their gameplay loops and anthem is trying to replicate that style of game, not be a traditional MMO with many other facets of gameplay like WoW. And Anthem failed at horrendously.
---
it's alright. 
---
Only after farming pre raid BIS for maximum /flex.
---
Ehh when did they confirm the beta?
---
Nostalgia bomb. VC tried to take him out once and we (kinetic) held them back 
---
If she really loves you, yes ;-) 
---
I was hyped but thats waning recently due to the complete lack of communication from Blizzard. The community is the only thing keeping interest in this game alive 
---
I played my last hunter this way (on a vanilla server) , but I went straight to Darnassus and Darkshore after the starting zone, to level up among those weird elves for a change 
---
Good to know! I hated grinding. 
---
Im sure we can learn to communicate in the subsequent 7 or 8 days of play time it takes to get from 20-60. Having played through the vanilla release zerg and on high pop private servers, the game is simply not designed to handle  so many players.  Mobs dont respawn fast enough (and there arent enough), zones and quest areas are too small and there are no alternatives for leveling the first 5 or 10 levels.  I am staunchly in the no change camp with the exception of starter zone (and up to 20 or 30 if we are being honest) sharding.
---
Have you seen confirmation that size will be around 3000?
---
You sound jealous
---
&lt;Murloc Overlords&gt; \[Horde\] EU-Undecided Server Type
---
We are currently a group of friends that met up within WoW. Our guild was part of a larger guild that become corrupt, which led us to disband from it and go a different direction. Throughout all of us, we have people that started at BC and others at Legion. We are open to newcomers as I only joined at the end of WoD and have had minimal experience within private servers as well.
---
Our main goals are currently to just get a community of players to play throughout Classic and depending on the numbers, we can make additions to the guild like raid days/community events etc.
---
As of now, the server type that this will be played on is not decided, hopefully by the time that we have more players, we will be able to have a goal as a guild to partake in mainly PvP or PvE activities.
---
In general, this is not a hardcore guild, if that is what you are looking for, i would recommend going elsewhere. We are here to have fun and make some new friends during that period.
---
Here is our discord, feel free to join and talk to us about anything gaming related. [https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb](https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb)
---
If you have any questions about the guild, message me on reddit or join the discord and send me a PM from there (I am Cattman312 on discord)
---
I hope to talk with you soon, and if not, i hope that you find what you are looking for in the rest of this page.
---
Do explain why you believe the current Pserver calculations for hit is wrong?   
---
His examples are valid. Know how hard a boss hits and be ready with a shield. If you can safely take a crushing blow and then some from a boss, you shouldn't be afraid to dual-wield if you're a half decent tank.
---
Not gonna lie, I just got rid of my ADSL2+ subscription a few months ago.
---
I played both in high end.
---
Warlock are weaks until aq40, then you'll be really good in both PvE and PvP, especially with naxx Gear.
---
Mage are the best caster early, due to the %hit with talents and a less gear dependance, and is style fine in Aq/naxx, imo just a little bit behind warlock in PvE.
---
And for PvP, mages and locks don't have the same role
---
Honor level 119 with 823,000 honorable kills. 
---
That's why I try every new expansion... and I'm always disappointed.
---
I was guild leader and raid leader in Vanilla. We weren't a top raiding guild, but hardcore enough to raid 3 times / week and to allow only certain specs in raids, but social enough to allow good players (even if not proper specced) to raid with us. We had an Arms Warrior, a Shadow Priest, even an Enhancement Shaman. We also had a very good Resto Druid, that wanted to be a tank outside raids or offtanking trash in raids.
---
He was a very good player, both as healer and 5 men tank. However, he would take MASSIVE amounts of damage while tanking, even with a bigger HP pool and armor.
---
Why the difference?
---
Well, simply because a Warrior have TWO main advantages over a Druid : Shield Block and Defensive Stance. Only these two allows a Warrior to be uncritable, uncrusable and take a flat 10% less damage, making Druids armor and superior HP pool irrelevant.
---
Other advantages that Warrior have over Druid is Defense Gear, the ability to use pots ON DEMAND (a Warrior can CHOOSE what pot to use, while a Druid HAVE TO PREPOT Stoneshield, triggering a 2 min CD on ALL pots), and not lastly, the "oh shit" CDs : Shield Wall, Last Stand and Lifegiving Gem (if available).
---
Survivability-wise, a Warrior is clearly WAY SUPERIOR to a Druid (or any other class tbh).
---
As for threat. This is a much longer discussion. On paper, a Druid can generate more threat compared to a Warrior. But in reality, he doesn't. There are few exceptions, but that only reinforce the rule.
---
What are those exceptions? Well, first one is overgearing the content, and I don't mean only the Druid tank to overgear it...but the ENTIRE raid as well. A druid that is in an AQ40/Naxx guild can, OBVIOUSLY, tank MC, ZG, Ony or even AQ20. But that is ONLY because healers can AFFORD using big heals (the Druid NEEDS big heals), because they are Naxx healers healing MC.
---
The Druid tank, geared in AQ40 and Naxx gear will OBVIOUSLY generate more threat in MC, compared to a Warrior, simply because the Warrior will be rage starved, while the Druid will generate plenty of rage both from damage dealt and damage taken ( the Druid will take more damage).
---
But...here comes the pickle : A Fury Warrior will do BETTER.
---
A Druid tank in Aq40/Naxx gear will generate more threat compare to a Prot Warrior in same gear...but will generate less compared to a Fury Warrior in same gear.
---
So, here is the drama of a Druid tank in Vanilla : during raid progress, he is well bellow a Prot Warrior, while after, he is well bellow a Fury Warrior.
---
Resist fights. The Defence Rating, for a Warrior, on a gear is not as important as people think. A boss that does 100% elemental damage (Ragnaros, for example), will NEVER CRIT. Defense is irrelevant for elemental damage. Elemental damage does not crit. Yes, the Warrior will drop some defense gear...but it doesn't matter. Druids will also have to use resists gear, losing stats.
---
...and the Warrior will STILL have all his arsenal : 10% less damage from Defense Stance (also applies to elemental damage), Shield Block, Shield Wall, Last Stand, pot use on demand, Lifegiving Gem.
---
Sure, the Druid will soak a lot of damage...but he will do it AFTER the entire raid overgears the content. No Druid, will EVER be able to tank Ragnaros (our example) during progression. After progression? Sure...but a Fury Warrior will be a better option.
---
One last thing to remember : people weren't idiots in Vanilla. We knew that the only viable tank was the Protection specced Warrior...not because "people said so", but because even the most dedicated Druid/Fury Warr/Paladin players understood WHY they can't do it : the GAME WAS DESIGNED with Prot Warrior in mind as "the tank".
---
Private servers are far from Vanilla. Flasks in Vanilla weren't even in AH for like a year. The Black Lotus was so scarce, that raiding guilds simply didn't had any extra to sell. World buffs (because of much lower population) weren't available on an hourly basis. When you have 20 guilds and 5 PUGS on a private server killing Ony...you have Only buff whenever you want.When you have only like 5 guilds doing that...you get the picture.
---
Armor debuff stackable on private servers, allowing Fury Warriors AND Druids to fully apply their damage, uping their threat, SLIGHTLY above a Prot Warrior. In Classic...they won't generate as much threat, because they won't do as much damage, because bosses will still retain armor, hence, physical reduction.
---
A Prot Warrior threat is based on innate threat skills, built in his skill...NOT on the damage dealt. Prot Warriors will lose minimal threat due to bosses armor, as opposed to Fury Warriors and Druids, who will lose a big chunk of threat.
---
Classic will be very different from private servers. The meta from private servers will not work in Classic. The meta from Vanilla will be back...because it was the only one that worked and the only one that will work in Classic.
---
Druids, Paladins and Fury/Arms Warrior in Classic?
---
They will tank 5 and 10 men, or raids that are 2 tiers bellow their raid.
---
AS IT WAS IN VANILLA.
---
It is what you want to believe, but it is not going to be like that. 
---
You can dig through the actual forum posts from 2006 and see that by that time some people did figure out that "You need fire resist gear for entire raid to beat Ragnaros" tactic sucks balls, because everybody gimps their DPS and healers go OOM. You can find a video of a fucking shadow priest tanking Onyxia. Mentions that some top guild MT's are going DW on certain encounters and so on.
---
It is not something like "entirely new meta" invented on pservers, pservers is where those things were brought up to light.
---
xD
---
&gt;This whole discussion ignores the crush blows mechanic.
---
Crushing blows is one of the first things mentioned.
---
&gt;No tank of any note will be duel-wield
---
All the best tanks currently duel-wield and swap shield only when necessary. The best tanks like Skarm, multiple Thunderfury guild with Naxx on farm.
---
Did you even watch the video?
---
&gt;This is some private PS server logic bullshit
---
The linchpin of the entire argument is that people didn't use consumes in retail Vanilla. Greater Stoneskin Potion alone is almost as much armor value as BiS shield. This doesn't include world buffs, flasks, other consumes, all of which will be standard for "any tank of note."
---
People in Vanilla simply didn't use consumes or wbuffs. Again, did you even watch the video, or are you just repeating the common misconception?
---
8 days we got a speed leveler over here..
---
Sort of a big thing for me, it's making more indecisive on picking a character than I would like
---
It's fine if you've been exposed to French in any way. The "ou" is a short "u" sound (as in "took" instead of a long "u" like in "pool"), while the "gne" is a soft "n" like the one in "niño".
---
Yes, the only thing you have to buy no matter what is the shadowy potions and Stardust, so that's 162g.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0
---
&gt;Base pet speed is now standardized for all pets, including legacy pets. Pet speed can still be modified through the talent Bestial Swiftness and pet abilities such as Charge, Dash, etc.
---
The irony is that with all our recent data and even some new finds (old retail Vanilla values) it looks like boss Armor values are higher on pservers than they were on retail. It isn't unlikely that bosses on pservers are actually harder.
---
Either way, small variability here or there isn't significant.
---
Let the luddites stay backwards. The less competition the better it is for the elites. Perhaps it's better the community remains ignorant.
---
Wow, during retail Vanilla? Do you remember if it was 1.12 patch?
---
Under-Tuned. There are a lot of numbers and mechanics that private server devs had to guess at and it's obvious even to them that they ended up under tuning the mechanics. The net result of the guessing is weaker boss experience even if the bosses themselves were over tuned.
---
Of a weird flex? No lol
---
They said they want to use sharding for the retail tourists that have no interest in staying long-term.
---
&gt; Got some sauce on that?
---
Not other than adding up the numbers on 4 different classes way back in the day no.
---
And even the numbers you provide show a 10g difference by level 40.
---
Yeah buddy cool story. Let me know how that fury offtank is going to make more threat than feral.

If you are interested in joining just pop in the channel and write to us or message me directly on Discord.
---
&gt; problem with wanting to mention avoidance is that a lot of warrior avoidance is parry whether you try to avoid it or not. whats parry do? ends up making the boss punch you in the head faster on the next swing 
---
No, idiot, is the OTHER WAY AROUND !
---
The ones who PARRY attacks FASTER !
---
If the Boss PARRY your hit, his next attack will be faster. If the tank PARRY the hit, his next attack will be faster !
---
You really have no idea how Parry works...and if you don't know this BASIC MECHANIC...no wonder you think Druids   are viable tanks for Classic.
---
They are on private servers, because of a multitude of factors that are WRONG. But in Classic? Druids will be RESTO and tanking 5 men.
---
As it was INTENDED.
---
SA hears ya! Summer was brutal..
---
You think they're going to drop the beta... a week today? 
---
... No. I'd love to be wrong, but that's just not happening. 
---
GI tailoring and herb. Save all the herbs for fast alc progress 
---
Sholomance
---
&gt;You HAVE TO group up with others to tag those mobs. This is the place where you forge your first friendships and talk with other people.
---
First off, this was not typical of vanilla (outside of launch). These mobs are clearly tuned to be solo'd, because they're stupidly easy in a group. 5 manning the starting zone trivializes all of that content.
---
Second, because it's so easy, there isn't any more communication than there is in retail now. Just spam out invites to whoever is killing mobs you need, accept whatever random invite comes your way, and faceroll everything. I've done this with players who don't speak english (and I don't speak their language), the lack of communication didn't slow us down at all.
---
The starting zones just aren't challenging enough to be good social content. If you have the personality to make friends there somehow, that's great but you'd be able to do it with sharded zones too. 
---
English language is so weird. Why can't you just write words the same way they're pronounced?
---
Sure they are not that bad, the point is that everyone and their mother will be questing there and thats the main point in going Darkshore. There is a reason a speed leveler like Joanna skipped Westfall completely.
---
/əˈnæθəmə/
---
Unless you're transcribing schwa as "A", you're wrong.
---
You do realise that tons, if not most people, started NOT on launch of whatever server they played on, and thus did not have to deal with such chaos? It's not at all required to have such a number of people running around that grouping up is mandatory just to learn this stuff.
---
Furthermore, you're making baseless assumptions on the scale of the shards, and even the level range in which it will be used.
---
I hate sharding with a passion too, and it's good to raise a fuss, but this reasoning is pretty crappy.
---
Arms is ‘okay’ for tier 1 raiding as horde, and 2H fury is actually BiS, but only for horde and tier 1 raiding. This is solely dependent on Windfury totem being available, without it, it’s pretty much useless. 
---
After getting tier 1 weapons and BiS blues, 1H fury will dominate all content. 
---
Point of this is that if you play horde, arms dps will be okay, but not in any case ideal for many reasons; you are dependent on bleeds. Bleeds take up at least one debuff slot, which makes it a no-no for any guild that cares. Mortal Strike is even worse, taking up a slot for a debuff that is useless in a raid setting. 
---
So, your go-to arms spec is pretty much useless in a raid setting. But the theoretical dps is not really that bad compared to other classes (assuming tier 1 level weapons and BiS blues).
---
As for 5-man content, a decently geared arms warrior with windfury decimates trash and is in my opinion the only fun 5-man dps class/spec to play. This requires windfury/horde unless you are geared out of your mind as alliance. 
---
If you want to play 2H dps, your obvious best bet is fury 2H spec as horde. 
---
As for what to do after progress. In my opinion, playing in a guild that forces you to do anything after the progress stage is not worth committing to, but to each their own.  
---
This should be the top comment!
---
People have been wanting an official vanilla experience and now people can’t wait to destroy it a second time!
---
They can't pronounce, cook, or maintain a regional economic alliance. What *can* they do? 
---
I watch every video, theorycraft as much as I can, searched for a guild whose members look like playing with will be a blast, and decided on faction and class (opposite to what I played in vanilla, so I have to re-discover the game again)
---
On top of that, I'm playing alternativelly Diablo 2, Battlefield 1 (original BF 1942 is empty of players) and replaying eternal darkness on my gamecube, just to get on that "what I was playing before the release of wow" mood.
---
I would say I am certainly overwhelmed with hype.
---
Shammies
---
Thanks for the help guys!
---
I like how you're downvoted for pointing out understandable logical leaps 🙄
---
Mages might farm more gold, but a rogue an farm the epic archmage pattern in lbrs and sell it to those mages.
---
200 iq rogue.
---
I can't read that without hearing "I'm the the medieval man" in my head
---
daboo daboo!
---
The eels pay pretty big buck because those are used for potions that are used for a flask of titans.
---
I think the up to lvl 10 is fine because no one will be doing dungeons but soon as you hit 10 sharding should be turned off. I find Dungeon groups are a true test of the community for your server.
---
Engineering without mining, will cost you thousands likely.
---
Is there any source for that you could share? I'd personally love to see some alliance speed leveling guides for inspiration, currently working on my personal one
---
I try to resist getting hyped over it, but its becoming more and more difficult.
---
It really depends on what changes the make. I'm fine with some changes that make things easier to manage on blizzards part, but if cross realms, LFR, achievements, item level or any of that stuff is present then I'll probably skip classic and start playing on private servers.
---
When they said starting zones......how many zones are they talking?
---
All too well
---
Same, I watch this video even today, and SOiL is one of my favorite bands today, saw them live a couple years ago... A+ 
---
He's probably a mage!  They're super saturated.  
---
Apologies for not mentioning. I would go Mining if I was to pick Engineering.
---
I saw him a lot. I leveled a lot of characters (probably around 20, it was my entire playtime in vanilla) up to about level 20 before finally finding my main in TBC.
---
&gt; can't wait for you to hit 60! we need somebody to innervate the priests!
---
My guild let me in at level 58 for that

**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE Server | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
Racials are pretty minor for PVE, will of the forsaken etc is handy for pvp.
---
What matters is your armour shoulder pad size on each race.
---
Overgearing the content.
---
Best part is the last line
---
Hahah I was thinking orc actually cause of how thicc they look.
---
Not just new races. TBC level 60 itemization makes basically all your vanilla leveling irrelevant, and the only thing is that 58 hard spot. In fact, Dungeon Finder and Battleground XP were the only possible solutions for that itemization gap.
---
I probably could have but I had zero resto gear because I had no intention of healing, has no idea how much meta was a thing
---
8 days is pretty fast more like 10  -12 days for a normal player 
---
&gt;Yes. Model update in window
---
actually the shape of the window - it's just too long for an NPC dialog in classic.
---
dwarf with beards
---
Love this idea!
---
Grinding satyrs jn felwood for felcoth is doable as holy. Also dm east farm with some spell dmg items.
---
Completely missing the point of why sharding is implemented in the first place.
---
BTW you can tell this meme wasn't made by a warlock.  
---
The Felsteed's "questline" is literally warlock trainer, bitch in ratchet.
---
High level mounts would be the epic 100% mounts, which is the Dreadsteed, which actually has a significant quest chain.
---
I wish i had a way of contacting old vanilla buddys. Feelsbadman 
---
Are you done yet? I'd really like that vid :)
---
You can make some money with engineering, especially if you learn both gnome and goblin.  But you'll have to go out and grind either way.
---
Mining will make you money tho, it'll take alot of travel.
---
Honestly, you might consider this instead.    Lvl up tailoring and enchanting.    Build up some cash selling bags and ammo, play the ah, d/e greens that don't sell well.  Once you get yourself enough gear to farm some of the places that can make you 50-100g an hr, switch then.  Both or just one, depending if you've gotten any good patterns.    Like you could farm crusader, those guys drop tons of cash, cloth and greens.   
---
But yeah, personally, I think that will be my lvl up Strat, synergistic cash making before I switch to PvP fun.
---
Gonna hit them with that good ol' switcharoo *Logs off*
---
&gt; People in Vanilla simply didn't use consumes or wbuffs. Again, did you even watch the video, or are you just repeating the common misconception? 
---
This is by far the most stupid phrase on this sub.
---
Private servers are wrong in so, so many ways. And because of those wrongs, the meta is different. It WILL NOT be the same in Classic.
---
There won't be any Fury Warriors tanking raids, for a VERY LONG TIME. And the only content they will EVER tank will be the one 2 tiers bellow.
---
Naxx guilds will have Fury Warriors tank MC and BWL...but NOT AQ40. AQ40 guilds will have Fury Warriors tank MC , ZG, Ony...but NOT BWL.
---
And NOT A SINGLE GUILD in Classic will use Fury Warriors during progression or the end-game AQ40 and Naxx raids.
---
Wasn’t really that into the PvP side but I played a rogue, called Duallion.
---
It's almost never just one of them either... 
---
I'm still deciding what to main. What faction. What spec when I finally do decide on a class. Every time I think I finally come to a decision I'm happy for at most 2 days before I start back tracking
---
I'm from Brazil and I'm 99% sure I WON'T play in a BR Server.
---
Only chance I'll play on a BR server is if my old friends for some reason decide to roll there, but I don't think they will.
---
The daughter is a qt3.14
---
Level up with skinning mining (can t track herbs and mines at the same time). Finish engie at 60 and drop skinning. Go for herb and grind or skip it and buy all the herbs you need to max alche. Do alche first if you want to make money from it, and lvl up with herba/skinning.
---
Imho engie first is a must for pvp, and as lock you can farm a lot without relying on professions (alche) too much. 
---
Hope it helps
---
If it wasn't for Facebook, I wouldn't have been able to either. 
---
Engineering is a must if you want to be at the top end competitive scene but its not required to be good. If your a good warlock you can wreck people that have eng. There is one really fun side to a warlock with eng though. If you have Dark pact from affic and the gnomish mind control cap you can control some mana user and drain em dry then destroy them lol. That being said i think herb and alchemy is probably the better choice if your rolling one toon and plan on raiding. Better yet you can go herb and skinning then use the gold from skins to buy the ore to lvl eng and just have a guild member make pots for you out of your herbs. It will take a bit longer but its worth it. Hope this helps
---
&gt; instead of being kicked out to your hearthstone location.
---
Or delete your hearthstone and just get ported to the gy.
---
Haha 😂 your tedious grind begins at level 60! I’m surprised you have enough time to grief warrior when you need at lest 60 soul shards on top of your other buffs to be raid ready. I’ve been in at least one or two BWL raids were a particularly irate warlock got very angry on vent that he was being benched. Because another under geared lock had snagged his place by bringing more soul shards. 
---
Sharding is necessary.
---
Thanks so much for this. This is exactly what I need to hear. I guess especially playing alliance v Undead with WOTF, eng is a must have to succeed in pvp . 
---
I will definetly level up with skinning and mining though, that sounds like a great idea.
---
For server stability
---
Whatever you say man, I'm loving my bronze orc statue.
---
Don't take a profession to save money on something. If you farm 100g worth of materials and use them yourself, it still cost you because you could have sold those materials for the money instead.
---
Pick professions that you enjoy, and if you don't enjoy professions focus on whichever professions will make you the most gold per hour. What those might be, I don't think we'll know until after launch.
---
I distinctly remember fighting over mobs tho.
---
K. You can farm DME lashers which has a really high base value which is +70g/hr, not counting rare drops. There’s also a chance a book can spawn in different locations near your clearing path and if you’re lucky something good drops from it$$$$$
---
Yeah although there’s a little trick often over looked for making warrior levelling considerable easier. 
---
Having played a highly geared mage in Vanilla, I can say, the class I had the most trouble with was a geared lock. By far, the toughest to take down. 
---
Locks don't get any valuable skill ups from 12-18, so just hit 12, go darkshore, return to IF at 18. 
---
**⚔ &lt;Requiem&gt;** \- Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore ⚔
---
**Intro:** We started out as a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.
---
***First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.*** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.
---
Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group\* of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.
---
*\*If you have past experience with being a raid/class leader (or even no experience at all) and are interested in applying for an officer position, PM me.*
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.
---
Discord: [https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE](https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE)
---
I don't think facials make that much of a difference in pve, factions do though. I would say to roll horde since windfury totem is a thing. Orc warrior should be the best choice pvp wise due to the insane stun resist they have
---
Well it was originally Alumium, then changed to Aluminum, then to Aluminium. The thing is the name is pretty arbitrary in the first place. Not like people get their panties in a twist over Platinum not being Platinium.
---
You, sir, have my mind boggled. 
---
Sure, you want to know what the differences are between Fury and Arms post-bis (for whatever reason). That information is probably out there somewhere, sorry I can't help.
---
Your ambitions to acquire post-bis and participate in end game PvP means you will play a whole lot. You'll be grinding, making gold, constantly gearing up and slaying the opposing faction whilst adhering to a raiding schedule and maintaining your PvP rank. 
---
If you're such a committed player, why are you seemingly prohibiting yourself to only play Arms for both activities? Role play reasons? If that's it, fine (as much as I think it's silly). Surely you are aware the respec system? If respecing several times a week is too much and is whats making you ask this question then I'm sorry to say your journey will only be a pipe dream. 
---
If you don't mind it, then you can happily play fury in PvE, arms in PvP, and one day far down the line you will acquire your post-raid arms BiS to see how it fares versus the other fury warriors, not only that but an added bonus of one less debuff slot for your raid.
---
 ??
---
Sorry I just don't get it. I read and re-read and try to make sense of your "dilemma", but I can't. 
---
Yes, Auto Shot has a 0,5 second cast time so you need to stand still for that time. When that's done you can use other shots or move while your ranged weapon is recharching. 
---
The irony of saying "people will run out of content and get bored with Vanilla" then advocating for a flying mount expansion which just kicks the can down the road, solving nothing and instead hurting Vanilla.
---
After flying mount TBC you get LFR WotLK, then that content runs out... Cata? MoP? BfA? That's what they're doing now.
---
But the customers want new shiny things. And they want convenience. The very forces that killed Vanilla the first time.
---
You said that you doubt he'll even get to 60, which is a stupid thing to say. I raided with plenty of people who had kids back in vanilla. Leveling takes time, but if you hit 60 with 8 days played, you'll have to play for 192 days if you play 1 hour per day. Not that crazy. 
---
If you' re alliance play mage, if you're horde go lock. Easy.
---
I’m rolling orc warrior for tanking. But if you are looking for a race that wears armor well and looks the best in it go Nightelf. Hands down they are agreed to wear gear the best lol 
---
Makes sense that the size will be around 3000, since they weren't planning any major changes to Classic - right? 
---
Maybe Orc is the best overall? You have axe skill which is really good for DPS and threat generation, as long as you're using an axe of course. Then they have that other racial that increases your damage and decreases healing done to you (blood something?), which is obviously a small boost to your DPS. *And* you have the 25% stun resist, which has got to be the best PVP racial in the game.
---
And they have *huge* shoulder pads, which as others have said, is the most important part when choosing a race.
---
I agree. Believe it or not, sharding in zonez 1-10 in Classic will be more "Vanilla Like" than having 800 people in Northshire Abbey on launch day. 
---
Yeah, thats common for lvl60 raiding: glancing blow formula, armor(both tank and boss), hit chance, resist chance, dodge chance, miss chance, crit chance, crushing blow mechanics told us that bosses for lvl60 character counts as lvl63 mob.
---
Can you explain to me how mining saves you money on engineering? Because from what I’ve read, mining isn’t very great gold per hour. So isn’t it better to just do the most efficient gold making method per hour for your class and then buy the materials to level engineering? Otherwise you’re just using up more time to farm the materials yourself, and time = money, friend.
---
&gt;  \&gt;I'm a 25 years old guy from EU.    
---
&gt;\&gt;ability to play 40-50+ hours on release and 18+ hours a day after that until 60 (at least) 
---
??? How (and why, lol)
---
By being better at the game.
---
Chill and mature resto druid/hunter looking for a hardcore Horde EU guild on a PVP server. I am planning to hit 60 during launch week, and able to raid every night of the week.
---
Me too
---
We are all assuming level 1-10. So all zones that fall within that category. Maybe 1-20 if its a streamer server and it in particular is way over pop. 
---
Hop on a low pop server on launch day and I doubt you'll experience sharding at all.  
---
&gt;WoW teaches players the most important things from start with the chaos. You HAVE TO group up with others to tag those mobs. This is the place where you forge your first friendships and talk with other people.  
---
&gt;It also teaches that you have to group up with others later when there is an elite quest. Those social bonds are important in this game.
---
It's not like you will be alone in "your" shard. Instead of 500 players in Northshire, it might be 100. (1. Sorry if my grammar isn't perfect 2. Speculation)
---
Finally someone with a high IQ in this subreddit.  
---
It actually baffles me when people say they will take mining to save them money on engineering or take herbalism to save money on alchemy.   
---
By saying that, they are actually saying that mining and herb is the best gold per hour which we know isn’t true. 
---
I always just mark, hit with concussive shot, then just let them be lol
---
After that line, you know they're elite.
---
&gt; It is not something like "entirely new meta" invented on pservers, pservers is where those things were brought up to light. 
---
They brought up to light what? A meta built on DISTORTED data? 
---
&gt; You can find a video of a fucking shadow priest tanking Onyxia. 
---
And that means what exactly? Means nothing.
---
ANY CLASS CAN TANK ANYTHING as long the entire raid is OVERGEARING THE CONTENT. A Naxx geared guild can use a fucking HOLY PRIEST to tank Ony if they want to. It will be for giggles.
---
A lvl 60 can solo ANY DUNGEON that is 20 levels lower. What the hell that this means? Again, nothing.
---
&gt; You can dig through the actual forum posts from 2006 and see that by that time some people did figure out that "You need fire resist gear for entire raid to beat Ragnaros" tactic sucks balls, because everybody gimps their DPS and healers go OOM 
---
What the hell are you talking about? Maybe that was in 2004...but 2006? You are simply LYING to reinforce your other lies.
---
Point being is that private servers are WRONG. The new meta from private servers is working only because they are DIFFERENT (very different actually) from Vanilla. And that meta wasn't "brought to light" on private servers...that meta NEVER EXISTED in the first place in Vanilla.
---
You think people were so dumb in Vanilla, that they didn't actually TRIED using Druid tanks, or Fury Warrior tanks, or if they did, they did it WRONG?
---
Dude...you have no idea how MANY people tried to be different in Vanilla. They REALLY wanted to tank as Druids or Fury Warriors. And those guys were good players, not idiots.
---
They didn't make it because the GAME WAS DESIGNED in such a way, that every class and specc had it's niche. And TANKING (which is a NICHE activity) was DESIGNED for PROTECTION WARRIORS in Vanilla. There wasn't some "hidden" meta that we, the Vanilla idiots weren't able to "bring it to light". 
---
It wasn't ANY OTHER META.
---
Mobs die so fast that IAotH is useless. I'd extra pet HP.
---
Sunder and Expose armor didn't stack. However, Sunder and Faerie Fire did as you can see in the screenshot above. I'm fairly certain Curse of Recklessness did stack, but I don't remember exactly. 
---
under Thrall's desk
---
Yeah it makes sense. I'm just itching for any confirmation or anything at this point lol
---
I know that.   But when the ah runs out and if you can't find anyone to sell to you, you have to just sit and wait.   
---
Personally I'd rather have some form of control over that 
---
She's old and outdated.  Upgrade to a newer version of qt:
---
https://www.qt.io/offline-installers
---
&gt;Haha 😂 your tedious grind begins at level 60
---
Yeah right, have fun with your 50+ lava runs IF reserved.
---
&gt;60 soul shards on top of your other buffs to be raid ready
---
Might come as a shock to you being a warrior and all, but locks are pretty good at killing things that yield xp or honor.
---
&gt;I’ve been in at least one or two BWL raids were a particularly irate warlock got very angry on vent that he was being benched
---
Ah good story. I don't suck, I'm an officer and my guild isn't retarded so....  But you better stock up on some repair bots because it's a long walk back from Kargath after repairing your broken shit and you've pissed off all your locks.
---
His WotLK videos were good stuff
---
That's when we knew how to slang.
---
It turned my head so much I went on pservers and just played the opposite faction on a class I don't care about.
---
Scratches the itch and I'm having fun
---
Not doing any unfinished business on the class of my desires aka ruining it
---
Humans for Alliance (mace/sword spec too good)

Orcs for Horde (Axe spec + Blood fury)
---
Fair point, I forget which sub I'm in tbh. I disagree with the rest of your comment though. I roll those because the likes of human &amp; night elf males, and the rest of the Alliance races all have terrible animations. Horde makes have decent animations, although a lot more have gone female in the likes of Orc for casters.
---
As someone who has and does play both factions, both factions have weird players, kids, idiots, people who think they're better (the latter being mostly horde...). 
---
That’s why you never preorder 
---
You’re just rewarding them for shitty behaviour
---
In the 4.1 trailer Ragnaros also says shaymin. I think it’s a Chris Metzen thing. 
---
That’s crazy if true. Spending more on marketing than actual game. Wtf
---
It shouldn’t be too low man, Frostmourne and Barth both have healthy populations. We should fill 1 at minimum 
---
If the Ah ever runs out (which it doesn’t) then it will become the best money maker since the demand will be so high. From playing private servers and the main game we know this is never the case 
---
Haha well there’s two: find a healer or roll a diff class
---
I do that, either Sap or Cheap Shot someone as I walk past but don't actually hit them. Especially low levels, it's fun to watch them waste a trinket or IBF or something. Whilst you're just continuing your 
---
It’s for the sword/mace spec
---
&gt;The linchpin of the entire argument is that people didn't use consumes in retail Vanilla. 
---
Oh, we used consus. Fucking tons of them because we werent efficient. We didnt have 15 years worth of testing and data. But what i recall it was more of DEFENSIVE consumables. You couldnt spam world buffs before every raid.
---
Can you even make a dwarf without a beard‽
---
&gt;I think this is an illegitimate attempt to reverse the burden of proof. If pirate servers produce totally un-Blizzlike results I think it's up to their defenders to prove that the results are genuinely Blizzlike, not up to anyone else to debug all their code and prove an error exists.
---
The project is open-source, with values. So if you believe that they're not Blizzlike, you surely should be able to show/tell what is wrong, to the point where it can be the cause for 3 times faster MC runs? - You got people working on producing a Vanilla-like server and you're stating they're not Vanilla-like in terms of numbers. Well, aren't it in everybody's interest, that you show them what is wrong? Their proof is the open-source github, if you believe something isn't Blizzlike, it should be easy for you to show everybody.
---
&gt; Do you really think Elitist Jerks and the other top guilds weren't doing this? If you do, then you just weren't around and taking the game seriously in vanilla. 
---
Yes, I do. There's definitely things which weren't known about, or things which they didn't know the power of. One of them is powershifting with Wolfshead Helmet. +weapon skills. Certain trinkets, BRE and so forth. 
---
&gt;Yeah, that's the myth the pirate server crowd repeat to each other. The world's top guilds in 2006 had never played a MMORPG before, didn't know what a spreadsheet was, didn't have access to combat log parses from actual vanilla gameplay, didn't know the keybinding submenu existed, didn't have mice, didn't know +damage increased damage or +heal increased healing, didn't know about downranking, and didn't know that having something in your weapon slots improved rogue and warrior DPS. Every single person in the world in 2006 was an utter moron who had never played a computer game in their life.  
---
&gt;Except... they *did* have access to the true value of the mechanics, because they could actually test it on a live vanilla server. And they did have accurate combat logs and spreadsheets and it wasn't all based on guesswork from shitty old youtube videos with who-knows-what variables not accounted for.
---
If you're actually serious about this, you would know that this isn't what a majority think. Anybody remotely knowledgeable about this, would know these things were used and known about. Some more than others, though.
---
&gt;That sounds logical until you remember that the skill ceiling in vanilla PvE is knee high and made of solid granite. I don't care how fucking special you think pirate server players are, they is no super-special super-secret pirate server optimised way of mashing frostbolt or shadowbolt that does three times the damage of the way the top 1% of mages and warlocks were mashing it in 2006.  
---
&gt;It's like saying you have a friend who is ten feet tall because we know lots about nutrition now, or that you can score 301 in bowling because people know so much more about the bowling meta. You can tell me until you are blue in the face that you are sure you did all the maths right, if the outcome is nuts then the question is not whether you goofed but where.
---
I'm not debating whether or not mages know how to spam one button better than back then, but if you want to delve into that, sure. I'm arguing the understanding of gear, stats and so forth is higher than back then, which leads to the difference between two mages. Also, using Warlocks and Mages is a terrible example, since they're some of the more simple classes to DPS as. Not that DPS'ing in Vanilla ever gets really hard, but there's definitely a difference between a Hunter/Warrior and a powershifting Druid, compared to Mages and Warlocks. I can literally boot up World First or AQ40/Naxxramas videos from back then, which I assume would be what you would consider cutting edge and hardcore players, and watch DPS Warriors not pooling rage properly and not fishing for procs with Hamstring. Same goes from gear, from what I can see. I'm not saying everybody didn't play properly, but the % of players actually knowing these things were much smaller than back then, small enough to the point where even world first guilds weren't full of them. That's my point. I believe the biggest reason as to why Naxxramas is steamrolled in one or two resets, is because people actually know their shit on a much higher level than back then. 
---
I'm genuinely not trying to be hostile, but I would really like to see what numbers you don't think is right on private servers. You got a bunch of people with a open-source project where everybody can see the numbers for themselves, trying to create a 'Blizzlike' experience, or at least close to it, and all you want to say is that something ain't right. It was wrong to say you have to 'prove' it, but I do definitely think if you say private servers get numbers/whatever wrong, for the sake of this discussion you should at least show/tell what is wrong. It feels a little too easy to just throw it out there, dismissing what they say is their work of somewhat Vanilla authenticity
---
I posted on a different thread about this armor stuff. Won't repeat it, but I will say only this : 
---
Private server bosses have higher armor values compared to Retail Vanilla, but that extra armor is negated by the stacking of SA, EA , FF, Annihilator, etc.
---
A private boss server needs to have an armor value exceeding 2250 (Sunder Armor) + 1700 (Expose Armor) + 505 (Fairy Fire) + 600 (3 stacks of Annihilator) . Which is 5055 Armor value.
---
NO BOSS ON private servers have over 4600 Armor Value. Yes, 4600 is HIGHER compared to Vanilla (where it was around 3700 for caster bosses and 4200 for rest), but that 4600 is simply negated entirely (and some more) only because of armor debuff stacking.
---
In 1.12.1 you can only apply 2250 (SA) + 505 (FF) + 600 (Annihilator). Which is 3355. 
---
In OTHER WORDS, even if in 1.12.1 bosses armors are LOWER compared to private Servers, they still retail physical armor reduction, while on private servers...they don't retain ANY physical damage reduction.
---
And because of this, Fury Warriors are able to out threat Prot Warriors...which won't be the case in Classic.
---
The meta of Fury Warrior tanks WORKS on private servers MAINLY because damage reduction through armor is NEGATED by stacking armor debuffs.
---
This alone allows private servers to kill raid bosses FASTER and spend LESS mana, leading to yet another META that wasn't in Vanilla : the use of Warriors and Rogues as MAIN DAMAGE DEALERS, because they will apply FULL physical damage on bosses with ZERO or NEGATIVE armor value.
---
In Vanilla, the Mage was THE KING of damage...and it will be again in Classic, because bosses will retain physical damage reduction, because armor debuffs WILL NOT STACK.
---
\* goes through all that to buff the hunter\*
---
\*hunter leaves group without saying a word\*
---
Warrior whispers: not even a thank you?
---
Hunter whispers: you want a medal?
---
Its not like you cannot use a shield for that one boss that actually hits hard. And still be in fury spec.
---
Skip it every time 
---
nope. you can only make without mustache, combining that with the purple eyed psychopth face is one of the best
---
I may be very wrong, but weren't addons more regulated in vanilla? Either way it's definitely a player problem to some degree, like I said too. I just feel retail gives the players a lot of tools to impose their methodology onto everyone, whereas I feel vanilla encouraged players to just do the best with what you got.
---
At least in vanilla, you can't just kick someone from a dungeon for whatever reason, and have them replaced in 2 seconds. No, you stuck with them probably unless they were intolerable and finished the dungeon or quest. Now there's a feature that insta-teleports people to your location in the dungeon, effectively cutting out the need for a world in an mmo, and it's more like a server list now. Retail basically adopted the whole gear score ideology which took toxic elitist behavior to the next level. Can't group with us if you're not this tall sort of thing. Pretty common to see PUG's in trade chats listing gear score requirements and addon requirements.
---
Unfortunately, I'm worried people will have the retail mindset going into classic and bring a lot of that behavior with them. Vanilla gameplay was more about struggling and overcoming or winging it and making it look easy. There was room to be casual or be extra serious and min/max too without feeling like a different breed of player. Everyone did the same exact content. But now you're an LFR raider or you're a heroic or mythic raider. 
---
But yeah, I'll definitely be playing classic the same as I played vanilla. Minimal addons. I'll be reading quest text to find where I need to be, and dodging boss mechanics precisely when the game lets me know about them. Hope to see you around!
---
That was voted the worst
---
What about blacksmithing in a warrior?
---
Yeah. I really hope they give at least a month’s notice. I would like to take the vacation so I can obsess.
---
In what world does an putting something in alphabetical order an intersting find, or a brain blast, or something? AH 
---
ha ha ha ha ha ha hahhh
---
Shhh don’t let them know, profit margins will drop.
---
Sharding is bad, but it is required on launch day. I mean, seeing all the players is cool, but this will be awful questing experience. I've just completed NE starting zone on PS and even considering that there were like \~50 players - it was pretty hard with those awful spawn timers. Furbolg quest in the eastern part of Teldrassil comes to mind where you have to kill like 8 furbolgs. There are only 8-10 of them and their spawn timer is close to 3 minutes, imagine what will happen on launch day when there will be like 50-100 players all grouped up waiting for these furbolgs. Also quest in druids den is awful. I was wating in line for 6 minutes to loot only 1 of 4 quest objects and there were only 6 players. Again - this quest will be super hard to do on launch day without proper sharding. Idk about other starting zones, but I guess every zone has some kind of similiar "bottleneck" which can't be just solved by "grouping up and socialising".
---
But ofc everything may change if these spawn timers on private servers are not blizzlike.
---
Also don't forget about lags. If population cap will be \~2500 and servers will be full then there will be close to 400 people in each starting zone. In that case, you won't be even able to tag mobs or collect items. Imagine what will happen if population cap will be higher, like 5k or 10k.  I am playing wow since late vanilla and I must say every launch day of new expansion except only for Legion - was a laggy mess (can't remember BC launch tbh because I was still leveling). I fear that without sharding classic launch will be just a big lag fest.
---
About socialising and making bounds - you won't meet again \~70% of those people from starting zones. They will change their servers/characters/factions/quit classic. Real socialisation comes after level 15-20 basing on my experience.
---
I believe sharding needs to be enabled only for launch week and only for low level zones which will suffer overpopulation.
---
My belief is they give us a summer release date or just admit they are pushing it back
---
He did state that Sunder and FF stack, but Expose Armor and Sunder don't stack. 
---
I doubt they even have a plan
---
Additionally, english isn't always the easiest language to read aloud with different pronunciations of the same word  or structure. Things like read and red can sound the same is an issue.

Secretly loathing one of my team members, whispering a rant about him to one of the other team members, but accidentally whispering the piece of shit himself.

I suggest to keep the leathers you need for engie and vendor the others. Also check this post about skinning while lvling:

People think a 3k cap means there will be 3k people on at all times. 3k also gives your server's population *very little* room to survive the residual loss in players as the patches progress. 
---
AND that low cap would mean we'd need like hundreds of servers. We would need 100 servers just to support the 300k that signed the Nostalrius petition. It all sounds absurd. 
---
Weirdly knowledgeable about the dissolution of adhesion of semen over time.
---
By using totems to boost tank threat tho it is probably not exactly as effective
---
Taurean is best for pve. They get extra HP that scale with gear and an extra threat generator. Orc is best for pvp because stun resist.
---
In what world is putting something in alphabetical order an interesting find, or a brain blast, or something? AH ha ha ha ha ha ha hahhh
---
Sharding according to them would ONLY be in the starter zones, which means you will not be sharded as soon as you leave Valley of Trials for example. So sharding will be for level 1-6, not 1-20. Even with sharding it will take several hours to get to 6 with lag and everything included, so you will still need to group up if you want to tag mobs faster.. BUT it will be much less lag free than non-sharding and just pure chaos. 
---
If you're really that adamant about #nochanges then you should advocate for servers being offline a few weeks on launch and when they're finally online it will constantly crash for a few weeks aswell which will end up with Blizzard providing us with free game time. That's the true vanilla experience.
---
Dag nabbit they dun sniffed us out!
---
They are wrong because they are overtuned (aka bosses have higher armor) and they use 1.12 talents all the way compared to actual vanilla, but besides that it is accurate enough. If you have evidence of some boss doing dramatically different damage/class abilities behaving absolutely differently then I would like to see it.
---
Of course feral druids were not a thing when their form armor bonus was small prior to talent revamp. Nobody ever said that druids and furies should be MT's during progression and it is a Prot warrior job, but once the content is cleared and the raid group starts to gear up, you can allow more flexibility.
---
Can be useful yeah. Engineering for min max tanking though 
---
Real men have engineering and farm DMN, just like hunters. Well, almost like. Just mind soothe most, and mindcontrol the few ogres that are too close to each other. Tribute chest is good money (and mana pots!).
---
Doable without shadow, but shadow helps. 
---
Do something like herbalism+engineering. You can sell the mats of the pots for the same price as buying the completed potions or have someone you know make the pots for you from your mats. As a alchemist (without herbalism) you aren saving any gold on potions. Only thing you can make gold on is transmutes.
---
Definitely doesn't work in German.
---
Warrior is W (Waffen), F (Furor?), S (Schutz). 
---
All you have to do is ask yourself? Are the items I need bind on pickup or bind on equip? If the answer is bind on equip then just pay money to have the item crafted for you. 
---
Tailoring gives a BIS chest which is bind on pickup only. It also gives 2% crit on the bloodvine   Vest which you need tailoring to have.  That’s why casters should take tailoring if they want to get an actual benefit out of their profession that money can’t buy. 
---
Subjective list:
---
PVE dps Alliance: Human
---
PVE Tank Alliance: Human &gt; Dwarf/Nelf
---
PVP Alliance: Gnome/Dwarf
---
PVE dps Horde: Orc &gt; Troll
---
PVE Tank Horde: Orc &gt; Tauren
---
PVP Horde: Orc &gt; Undead/Tauren
---
It all depends on what you want to do. I'd go orc on horde due to their axe specialization, bloodfury and stun resist racials. Tauren would be a runner up due to the bigger health pool, on demand stun and extra range on their attacks. For alliance I would actually choose gnome. I find their racial very fun to use and nothing pisses your enemy off more than being destroyed by a midget. Human is very good though and if you're not interested in PVP in the slightest, it's probably the better option. Everything has positives and negatives. Choose what looks cool to you or has an interesting racial ability. 
---
greater Sagefish all day. cook it into Sagefish delight. take a stack for yourself for your raid and sell the rest. it's how I afforded my mount at 40 
---
That's what I did and then I got addicted and then a server rollback was the perfect reason to quit. 
---
Agreed.  It's a necessary evil.
---
This is an old stat, but sometime pre-cata Blizzard revealed that around 70% of people never made it past level 10.  If the goal is long-term servers with stable populations of around 3k, then initially overpopulated, sharded servers is a much more elegant and community-saving approach to that than waiting 2-3 months and merging a bunch of 500-pop servers.
---
This. Spent 10mins going on about last night to someone I haven't even met.
---
Yeah, he knows.  His point is that even if you were to ignore sword/mace spec, Human still has huge value because of Diplomacy.  In a game where advancement is predicated on time investment, it's arguably the greatest time-saving racial in the game.
---
This is most true
---
A really smart post by someone that's going to take herb/alch to make more profit from it. Gotta get that competition out.
---
Failed I have... Into exile I must go...
---
Pick skinning &amp; herb. Mail all the cloth to your alt character while leveling. When you hit felwood and start getting felcloth, drop skinning and lvl up tailoring. When you have your truefaith made, and maybe extra mooncloth for a set of mooncloth bags, drop tailoring and pick up engineering. Buy mats to level engineering up, trinkets are OP, esp. cloaking device as it can be used in combat to drop combat once per hour. Seaforium to open the DMN door -&gt; you can solo farm DMN almost as fast as hunters. Have some +spell hit gear just in case to not get your MC's resisted. You will need a invis pot as well to get past the second last boss.
---
Also the ability to farm your own herbs helps a ton on consumables, as a priest your consumables are pretty easy as well, so once you get your initial gear and all the needed enchants for it things get a lot easier money wise.
---
That’s not me mate, I’m the one helping you with that good damn boss needed for your epic mount because the god damn book won’t drop. I must have done at least 100 dire maul west runs, I ended up just buying it from the auction house, luckily Draconian Deflector dropped after about three runs. 
---
But yes I’m a goblin engineer because killing things at current level is extremely tedious so I can have at least a little fun with them gadgets and explosives. I’m also a huge burden to all Warlocks because I’ll be fishing in the bay of the storms and relying on a summon to get to the raid. 
---
Damn you got me 
---
I’ve pre order many games at launch and enjoyed it........ anthem was just a flop
---
That is the one!  Thanks for the link!  I remember using some of those techniques to make some money back in the day, but they never seemed to be up to par with how much I could make just grinding away or doing other things, even as holy priest.  
---
Thanks fam
---
Lock requires a much higher skill cap to play well (especially coming from a pvp-minded background).
---
&gt;2% crit on the bloodvine   Vest
---
Yeah but then you have a wear a vest. I'd rather wear a robe with CRIT on a shadow priest than vest with good stats.

I didn’t mark so I wouldn’t give myself away.  Nothing like starting off with an aimed shot out of nowhere.

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
---
True
---
Narr use lots of cloth gear with spirit and stamina and keep an eye out for staves because there’s can often have comparable dps to other melee weapons and come with spirit to boost. 
---
You can instant-judge, nothing to complain about. 
---
&gt; That’s not me mate, I’m the one helping you with that good damn boss needed for your epic mount because the god damn book won’t drop.
---
You mean the shield or bracers... and No, you're not.  I have a guild warrior and priest I cut in on warlock summoning services and neither of them are you.
---
Unless you are going for AQ mount there is no need for Diplomacy. And even then it's just nice to have. 
---
Yeah! That is a great idea! Because it is hard to only wait for your friend, unless you have a different game you are playing.
---
Profit margins will only be "big" early on anyways.  As the availability of higher level crafting professions along with the eventual increase of "rare" patterns progresses onward, inevitability competition drives prices down to the point that most gold making profit margins from professions are razor thin.  
---
The best way of making gold has, and always will be: farming.  And I mean more than just materials for professions.  (i.e. cloth or ore).  
---
Farming anything in any area always nets you a positive outcome, assuming you don't die a lot and have a repair bill in excess of the money you made grinding mobs.  Grays, non-useful whites, and shitty greens will all give you a small increase.  The "real" money you ever make in game comes from selling BoE Blues/Purples along with rare drop materials (i.e. Righteous Orbs).  
---
&gt; So I never played wow classic or wow it self. 
---
You also did no research before asking
---
Personally i don't like the idea to going herbalism by warlock. There are a lot of much more interesting spots for farm with a void. If you are interest in PVE, tailoring - number one choice. Eng vs Alch? Eng will cost a lot w/o mining and will not bring you huge advantage - locks already have a lot of control. But if you don't planning to monitoring AH, alch will be rubbish.
---
Only way to know for sure those flasks ain't watered out though
---
Evil evil man!
---
Derp
---
What is IBF? Also, there is actually enough WPvP interaction on live to do stuff like this?
---
What the fuck? This has to be the absolute rarest thing in wow right? I knew about city protector, but didn't realise anyone got it. Did you actually have that ability to teleport to your capital city?
---
Vanilla had a huge variety in casualness/hardcoreness of guilds. The range went from super super casual to totally hardcore.
---
I think that classic will have a much more clear cut-off line between hardcore and casual.
---
The hardcore pserver record-attempt-raiders will flock into the totally hardcore guilds, then there will be a whole lot of nothingness and then the rest of the guilds follow.
---
Last night I was on my Belf at the azerite mountain in Drustvar, near the Horde outpost, and lots of WPvP was going on. Died a few times, but once I finally finished the quest I went back to the base with a mark on me. Don’t think that hunter ever got to me though. 
---
Eng
---
Lol what?
---
- Here's debuff that says "reduces armor by 2000". Ok.
---
- Here's debuff that says "reduces armor by 560". Ok.
---
There is literally no reason to believe that the end result wouldn't be total reduction of 2560. Debuffs that don't stack are simply not allowed to exist at the same time (e.g. expose armor and sunder armor). 
---
Noob
---
Nope. The c is a hard c. Pronounced like the word school.
---
Why? It's just grinding a bunch of melee mobs that aren't even grouped. 
---
look how he says the people with herb " wont be able to afford flasks"....wtf do you think they are made of?  He does have a point that caster tailoring is almost something you have to have to be competitive with your peers, especially for like warlock.
---
I care when i'm playing.
---
Then I stop for a while.
---
Then I inevitably pick it up again.
---
Almost time for another go.
---
I played vanilla and we used a fury warrior in naxx. He had 10k hp buffed so survivability wasn't a problem. The difficult part is keeping the rest of the raid alive, so you want those short fights.
---
I never said people with herbalism won’t be able to afford flasks 
---
Yes, I know. It was an example of mispronounciation.
---
People are going to leave anyway once they finish whatever it is they want to finish in classic.  The big thing now is that you don’t have to leave if you don’t want to.
---
With the new warmode there's almost always WPVP whether honorable fights or massive raid ganks
---
Like I said people who do take the time to prep will eventually leave for better guilds and leave you with 40 people who are too lazy to raid prep. Good luck getting through Naxx with no consumes. 
---
Memories of spamming whispers to all possible tanks just came flooding back. 
---
The sword you moron. 
---
I (feral druid) tend to say at start of the dungeon that I will roll Need on green healing/int gear, but will pass on the blue BoPs, since it's not really required for me to heal properly. You can heal fine in greens.
---
On my hunter I will roll need on 2H axes  with agi or staves with int if the upgrade is big enough though since a +15int +10sta BoP stave is way better for healing than my old4agi +4sta green weapon. Hunters need a SOME int items after all. 
---
Only heard about it quite recently so is probably a PS thing but who knows? Strange bugs have occured before (until patch 1.3 Quvier and Ammo Pouches stacked in vanilla due to a bug).
---
Not at that range :(
---
Icebound Fortitude. It's a Death Knight spell that breaks and makes you immune to stuns and also reduces damage taken. 
---
That is not the problem, I will perform well on all classes because I am capable of learning the things required for a class to be played well. It is purely the fact that I cannot decide which of these classes gives me the most benefits
---
1.1 druid did about 10dps at lvl 15. Nuff' said.
---
Yup, I love it. Any time I'm on I'm in the world PvPing. 
---
No anymore,it was active till Naxxramas update.However i was able to talk in the worlddefense channel for a while,then blizzard extended this feature to ranks 12,13 and 14,till it was shut down before the burning crusade expansion hitted(opening dark portal event).
---
Exactly
---
overall: human warrior. 
---
for pvp: alliance is better for warriors, cos you got paladins that freedom you, and mobility and getting to hit shit, istead of stnding in slows roots being kited is the n1 issue for warriors.
---
and for pve: and out of allaince humans are the best for pve. cos they got sword/mace specilization which gives them an edge as dps, aswell as it helps tanking a lot, cos you do more threat.
---
So overall its human warrior, if you consider all aspects.
---
Yeah we pressed on to much the allies \^\^!
---
It's definitely one of my favorite features they've tried. It still needs some tweaking on how sharding with it works and the incentives
---
Hi, /u/netherphrost
---
10k online doesn't mean 10k lvl 60s. Economy will always shift, it'll be different from vanilla given peoples better understand of the game.
---
Don't really understand your point with rares.
---
Servers like nostalrius seemed to survive fine even though you claim farming will be impossible.
---
No clue about IBF, maybe ice bound fortitude, but yeah if you have warmode on there is constant world pvp. Honestly, much more than on classic where not everyone plays kill on sight. Problem is its a 10 v 1 gank on the flightpath you've just landed on because people have grouped for pvp quests. No matter what faction your on, you're likely outnumbered if ungrouped because of the way warmode sharding shuffles players who group for world quests. 
---
Sometimes its quite fun, but it tends to be tedious. 
---
no
---
I thought you had to pick a speciality? Couldn’t have both gnome and goblin?
---
Why the fuck didn't you just say quel'serrar?
---
Maybe you should finish the rest of that episode...
---
&gt;  I had zero resto gear because I had no intention of healing, has no idea how much meta was a thing
---
I have always been holding some intelect gear in my bags. Even though I was feral and not thinking of going resto.
---
You can abandon a specialty and take the other.   You'll be able to use the new patterns that aren't specific.
---
I remember as if it was yesterday
---
guess you've never worked as a hotel cleaner
---
So were you able to teleport to cities?
---
I think they use sharding at start so we can have a bigger cap thab 3k at start. Once the "launch" has settled down a bit the cap of 3k will be introdused.
---
I dont think we will have the 3k cap AND sharding at the same time.
---
Oh, as far as I was concerned, minor beastslaying separated the boys from the men when it came to low-level gear exhibitionalism. 
---
Some people get satisfaction from making their stuff 100% themselves. From mining the mats themselves to farming the pattern.
---
I have friend who likes to level tailoring JUST for the "made by" tag on  his bags.
---
That’s fine if they enjoy it but you have to agree that they are incorrect in stating they are saving themselves money. 
---
A lot of people in gaming always say that they first opened the vault in Fallout 3 was the defining moment in gaming. I had that in 2004 when I first stepped out of Death Knell as an undead. 
---
We could get in there in BC. A guildie showed me in one time. You would duel outside of the closed off gate and someone would sheep/fear you until you clipped through the gate and you cancel the duel and you're in. It was a weird place.
---
Mining, herbalism, alts that can farm better, play the AH or accept the fact that you dont farm as efficient as other classes.
---
Damn, a guild kick is pretty rough! Guilds back in the day were more stringent than most companies I worked for! 
---
In vanilla you will have to ditch the whole profession and relevel from 1-300.
---
Therefore most people who actually do that go gnome 1-260 first for battle chicken and death ray and then relevel goblin for all that sweet PvP stuff.
---
Engineering only costs like 100g to level anyways, so its not too bad. It's basically 100g for two really good trinkets which would cost hundreds or even thousands if they were BoE.
---
Is there a place people are seeing/hearing about these week 2 guilds?
---
*Laughs in PVE server*
---
I know it was in at some point because some asshat tricked my noonlb self into using it in a macro by telling me it was easy way to desummon my pet. Made me lose Tarpit, my awesomely named Imp. This was ages ago and could have been well before 1.12. 
---
I distinctly remember when they downgraded armor shoulder sizes way back in vanilla. I had an undead character and thought he looked so cool before it happened and then..... The change. Now undead still have tiny little spaulders that cover their shoulders weirdly 
---
haha I remember when I was drunk and countertrolling some troll on discord, some russian-name guy kept telling me how night elves are dumb, retarded sexually, etc. I sent him a swastika and said something like "if there is some race that has to be exterminated, it's those russians" - and, when trying to block him, I figured out that I was actually on my guild chat, not his private
---
The next morning I woke up, I was not in the guild, and my former guildmaster had me on ignore. One of my friends told me that I was kicked for "three warnings" - one warning was for racist text (saying that "those russians" should be exterminated), one warning for sending a racist picture (swastika), and one warning for pointless offtopic spam
---
Get her into wow, quit your relationship or quit wow.
---
Its a hard decision. I struggle aswell.
---
Yep, it's known by PvPers that if you have 15min+ queues, you go for herbalism and roam areas like Felwood or Burning Steppes farming herbs and the enemy faction. Herbalism &gt; mining any day of the week if you do need to go out into the world for something like PvP.

NA-EST- PVP/PVE - Horde
---
Full time nurse/real life-r looking for semi-hardcore/Laid back raiding guild! Mainly looking for a solid community of people to enjoy the vanilla experience with =\]
---
EST - Tuesday/Wednesday/Sa or Sun Evenings
---
Looking mostly to raid, have fun on discord and wind down from the craziness of the work week with some new friends.
---
Played a handful of roles since vanilla mainly heals/DPS looking to expand the horizon depending on needs.
---
PM me here! Discord info to come.. Thanks!!!
---
LF1M Jailbreak need tank good group
---
I used to do the same thing in terms of buying too much gear off of the auction house. I used to remember buying my first helm off of the AH, and when I was finally able to equip it, being disappointed by the model... I tried the private show thing, but unfortunately nobody wanted to see an undead male dancing naked.
---
Fastest wat is pure questing following a route from a guide. But the most fun way is do questst in a zone you like untill they get to hard. Do some dungeons for shiny blues and try to find people to help you with group quests. If you a fan of grinding mobs for hours that is also a good way to level.
---
...and all this crap is from private server testing, not Vanilla...so good luck with that.
---
Play hunter if you want to enjoy the game pre-60. Do not play a hunter if you want to have fun at 60. People will say "just play whatever you want", but if what you want is a bad class, there will be a stigma against you and that will prevent you from joining groups and actually doing the content, unless you find a guild that is okay with that, and you yourself can accept that you are not as good as someone who picked a different class, whatever you do. If you don't want to bother with that, roll a mage. If you can deal with finding open minded people who are willing to basically carry you through content, roll a hunter.
---
In my subjective opinion, hunter is a lot more fun than mage, but I wouldn't play one, simply because I don't want to have to deal with being inferior due to my class choice, and not my personal skill.
---
Yes
---
Like... I only know 2 of my retail locks pet names. Geljub the Imp and Ikzilnash the Felguard.
---
I think paladins are slightly better but shamans are more fun to have in your team because of the windfury proqs.
---
Yeah I’d be looking for the fastest or most optimal way to level, do you know of any guides off the top of your head?
---
13 euro or 15 dollar a month. Nothing more. No expansions needed.
---
As someone who has levelled multiple alts to around 50 but never reached 60, yes, I love the levelling experience very much
---
&gt;So remember folks, time is money friend and the high IQ play is to take professions that actually benefit your character, such as Engineering and Tailoring for casters. 
---
The thing is, usually most efficient gold farm for a healer ... is doing DME jump runs with herb and enchanting. So, do you want to have professions that benefit you or that will make most gold ?
---
And the real answer ALWAYS is, you want a mage alt to grind gold.
---
So you can continue to use the gnome items you crafted after dropping it?
---
Rushing 1-60 is such an ungodly long and boring grind, even going as fast as humanly possible. Rushing to max in an expansion is very doable and even fun - take a day off work, pull an all-nighter, and you're there! For 1-60, you're looking at (at least) an entire week of that. I can't think of a better way to burn yourself out and make you hate the game. 
---
&gt;Do you need locks for summoning? For the standard buff run my guild does, we don’t use locks and it’s actually frowned upon if you need a summon.  
---
&gt;Before raid, set hearth to CHRun DM Trib or use a cleared one for the 3 ogre buffsGet a mage in DM to port you to SWFly to Westfall, run to ZG IsleLog out (can be even a day or two before raid time if you want)Log in right at raid time, get ZG buffPort to SW, get Ony head buffPort to Darn, fly to Felwood, get Songflower as a guildAll hearth to CHRun to AQ, should arrive with still \~100-115 mins on all buffs, about the amount of time it takes to get Cthun down, especially if you’ve pre-cleared Skeram on a previous raid day (Skeram often kills people, which wastes their world buffs, and pre clearing him also increases your chances to get to Cthun with buffs still up)  
---
&gt;No locks needed
---
No offense but THIS right here is what u/brawlinglove was talking about.  During your first 1-2 progressive kills on a boss in a raid, sure your guild might be min-maxing buffs.  But this is not usually the norm.  This is what the OP is talking about the community being "so serious".  
---
Noone is opposed to being "raid ready" (gear repaired, bringing flasks/potions and maybe runes if necessary), but stacking this many buffs is hardly necessary to clear content.
---
In the real world, a workplace environment with that type of person/attitude is usually referred to as "overbearing".  Not a good thing just FYI...
---
Healer &gt; dps is most cases.
---
But druid isnt the most desired healer while mage is a desired dps.
---
Still resto druid &gt; mage i think.
---
If the most gold per hour is taking herb/enchanting then that should be done.  It varies from class to class. Yes the mage alt is the best option. Probably with skinning/herb at Dire maul
---
It wouls be a more interesting question to ask 3-4 years from now. Will players begin to get bored and want new content? Would it be better to release BC realms? Or a 1.13 patch? What would that design vision even look like, considering a small fraction of the original devs still work at blizzard?
---
Can't really know until it happens. Right now I can say I don't want post-Classic content, but that opinion might change in a few years
---
I remember Skarm. He used to be in a certain guild and then left to start his own. Tried to poach players from the guild he previously left, stole all of the loot for his corrupt loot council guild which he was the leader of causing massive drama and hatred towards him. Sounds like a great guy to be taking information from, real stand up fella.
---
You can't use the ones that specifically mention gnomish engineering such as world enlarger and the porter to Gadgetzan.
---
But gnomish death ray and battle chicken are BoP, however do not need gnomish engineering to use. Therefore you can craft both of them and then ditch the profession and learn goblin.
---
A funny sidenote: you can ditch engineering altogether and STILL use gnomish death ray without the profession.
---
How is this related to the information presented in the video? Im afraid I dont see the connection. Im sure some people would describe you as a real stand up fella as well.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm
---
Its a guide from the world record holder. I think this one is horde only but not sure.
---
Its 4 days 20 hours but as a hunter.
---
Other classes could do it in around 6 days if you know the route. First time it will take 8-10 days would be my gues.
---
Do we even know there will be a beta?
---
Their release policy is that they'll launch it when it's ready. They had a small team working on it back in 2013-2015, the majority of CDPR was working on Witcher 3 + DLC. They hired a lot of people for Cyberpunk 2077 because they raised the bar with Witcher. Like Rockstar they have to out do themselves, which means more time in the oven.
---
I agree. Vanilla is one of the few games where it's actually more fun to be a noob. 
---
That’s pretty lame if you’re a mage class. Imagine doing all that grinding just for the ability to do something you can already do haha
---
Mmh. 
---
Be Goblin engineer (But not goblin!).
---
Abuse a guildie with gnomish to craft you 500 sappers.
---
Reputation with said guildie after he has crafted them: hostile.
---
Skipping school just to find out there was a big maintenance is the worce feeling ever.
---
Yup. I can't wait. 
---
I love it. I'm going to call it that from now on.
---
It puts into question his integrity and the validity of his statements. 
---
As u/tdotfella said, need to drop it and level from 0. It is cheap to level though.
---
Ishne'alo'porah!
---
I'm basically limiting myself to a couple hours a week on pservers, trying not to spoil too much content on myself before I get the real thing
---
Like an addict at a methadone clinic...
---
A rogue with 5/5 MoD has +15 stealth, which basically translates to being detected from about 5 yards if you are **facing** the rogue, less than 3 yards from the back. At this point you're already in melee range anyway and sapped/engaged, it's only relevant in a handful of situations.
---
Perception gives +50 stealth detection. In-game tests show that it increases the detection to about 15 yards (in front of you) but still around 5 yards from the back, so already in melee range as well. So realistically it doesn't do a lot for you. For comparison, Rank 2 vanish gives +270 stealth.
---
More importantly, if you know a rogue is around you then he surely knows you're aware as well and will either wait for you to blow your Perception cooldown before approaching or wait for you to be at a disadvantage, ie fighting a mob, low health, etc.
---
A lot of people coming from retail will remember the passive version of Perception that came in with the Echoes of Doom patch, last TBC patch introducing LK talents. That one was very strong for sure, plus humans received their racial "insignia" during the same patch on top of that. But in vanilla it's pretty lackluster to be honest and the last reason why you should pick human in my opinion.
---
I would say priest. Paladin is mostly autoattacking. Re-buffing yourself and boring healing spells.
---
Priest got instand dots, channeld dmg and a cast dmg spell + shields, hots and heals. Also wands are chill yo play with.
---
If only that would work when you're in combat.
---
Nothing more than you would use for anyone else. The devil is in the detail especially once it comes to drama. If I steal an apple in the supermarket it wont affect what I know, or what I dont know, about global warming. 
---
Only thing that the AH would need to run out of is iron/mithril/thorium. And they wont run out. Stones you need for powders can be farmed from rock elementals.
---
Context: was on a level 21 orc rogue on a Pserver through ashenvale. I notice hunters mark, look around but see no Hunter. I think of this meme because I know hunters have a 200yd range on it and they can outrun me. 
---
Ended up being a level 23 night elf who wasn't very good and I killed them. Didn't even use concussive shot. 
---
Sounds like a good idea for a weakaura.
---
Of course the devil is in the details. I left a lot of those out. From my own personal experience the guy is a scumbag and I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him. Just my opinion though.
---
I will stone you, stone you  
---
Wrap my arms around you  
---
My little HALO
---
But this isn't about trust? You dont have to trust anyone? An claim is being made about an objective truth/false thing, it has NOTHING to do with the person saying it. 
---
Because I frankly couldn’t spell the swords name, it’s been like fourteen fucking years. But the important part is getting the drop. Once you have the book your guaranteed to get the sword since it’s a quest reward.
---
You can certainly do that, but sappers take quite a long time to craft (25seconds). [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=12760](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=12760)
---
Unstable trigger: another 8 seconds.
---
Then you have Goblin Rocket Boots which only have a 5min CD instead of the gnomish 30min, but the goblin ones do break on occasion, therefore you also have to craft these. 
---
If you have 100g spare change, invest into going goblin, sending stuff back and forth becomes such a chore.
---
You had 9 alt accounts? 
---
I'm suprised there is no AKSHUALLY guy here talking about his shaman from 1992 yet.
---
Everyone with a instand non-projectile abillity has an advantage. 
---
Moonfire, flameshock, fireblast.. and maybe more.
---
 \- ability to play 40-50+ hours on release and 18+ hours a day after that until 60 (at least) 
---
so in order to do this  you basically have to have no job, friends, or gf/bf lol
---
These people care about feelings more then facts I’m afraid.  It’s the same reason why people hate Tommy Robinson in the UK or Trump in the US. They don’t care about facts, only feelings. 
---
Need to find a good video on how this is done.  Don’t have much experience with DMN.  
---
Can you get a key for DMN, or does it have to be blasted every time?
---
What happened?
---
no, had 4 alt accounts created with the help of the Warcraft movie.
---
Though I doubt that the rules for reserving guild names, have changed.
---
10% isnt enough to make any notable difference. Maybe you save a week on your ZG exalted grind, but after that the racial has no benefit. Certainly not worth going human just for that when any other race will get more pve utility out of their racials.
---
Thank you.  Didn’t see this video yesterday.

No it doesn't, some of the most knowledgeable Overwatch players are complete tools. Doesn't mean they don't know how to play the game.

Take your personal vendetta somewhere else.
---
a slot machine in WOW Classic?
---
Please...
---
Paladins much better
---
So you're not counting the time spent leveling an alt?
---
You get the key to most of the DM doors from a quest in DM:East. But for the tribute run, you need to run the dungeon with only killing the last boss, for max loot on the chest. Every boss you kill will lower the amount of loot in the final chest. (The chest is a tribute the ogre officers pay you when you are the new king!)
---
The trick is, the key to the last closed door is hold by the first boss in the instance. Instead of killing him, you can use a skeleton key (blacksmith), seaforium (engineeting) or a rogue to lockpick it. Also at least on some p realms you can kill the first boss, loot the key, run out and reset the dungeon, and then head back in with the key in hand!)
---
First door inside the DMN is kept in a chest that is on a patrol route for the first boss, but he is easy to skip.
---
All the keys in DMN are single use only.
---
In the long run, the time spent becomes more and more redundant but in the short term, you would lose money levelling an alt. After a certain. amount of time you will start to break even and then start seeing a return on your investment.
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding here, but the Bloodvine Set is not BoP, and the vest does not give crit.
---
All the pieces give hit, only the set bonus gives crit, and only the set bonus requires 300 tailoring.
---
What, what, what?
---
I'll go for professions that I will enjoy. If it is a reasonable money maker/saver, cool.
---
Keep in mind thay numbers like those are not public knowledge unless a company chooses to disclose them or journalists decide to do their actual job and investigate into what happened during a development lfecycle.
---
Jason schreier comes to mind. Hes the one who broke a lot of insider stories.
---
However if you do a fast google search you will start seeing a pattern where at least half a game's budget is on matketing.
---
In the list of most expensive games developped, you see cod mw2 in the nb 1 spot with 50 million budget on dev and 200 million on marketing.
---
Gta5 is 2nd with 137 development cost and 128 marketing cost.
---
Those are some crazy ass numbers.
---
I dont see why companies are going for old school super expensive advertisment when they can sponsor streamers for a few days to a week to spread the word, in addition to youtube ads a month before launch, E3 appearances and some trailers and teasers on their youtube channel.
---
Apex did that and it has spread like wildfire. 
---
Only variable here is: the game must be good.
---
High budget advertisment can entice a user to buy a product which turn out to be bad. And follow the marketing strategy apex did for a game like anthem or fallout76 would end up crashing the game to the ground because simply enough: they are not good games.
---
Excellent summary.
---
 I'd like to point out though on the topic of Feral Druid that a lot of information has been spread that wasn't around during retail classic. For instance proper gearing and the Crowd Pummeler from Gnomeregan. Now that being said I doubt we'll see Feral tanks perform as well as on private servers, but they'll definitely do better than they did back in the day.
---
That’s a different argument. We aren’t talking about what you will enjoy the most. We are debunking the people that claim they will save money by going herbalism alchemy. 
---
7 years of development
---
Yes, sorry. You need the set bonus which is BIS for mages still so taking tailoring is worth since you will want the set. 
---
Yes, you are correct, nothing wrong with goblins. Gnomes are food though.
---
The rocket boots are BOE as well, so abuse said guildie to make it all for you, esp for horde everlook is close, but that tanaris port saves a lot when you have to haul your ass to silithus a lot.
---
He probably wondered why he would log in and spawn at the spirit healer too 
---
grow up kiddo

engineering over alch. for both pve and pvp
---
engineering is the master profession and anyone who doesnt use it is bad at this game.

Unless you are a Warlock, Death Coil dot dot dot..

You mean facts like Trump being an indicted co conspirator to a felony?

Fake news 
---
Trinketing the sap has to be the dumbest move ever. 
---
Only if you would spend ALL of the time grinding gold... i personally would play alts no matter what. Easier way to grind gold is just added bonus.
---
I hope they keep the shard populations quite high still, being part of an expansion release swarm is some of my favourite moments.

---
Level with skining + herbalism, then switch into engineering + leatherworking
---
But, I guess I'll be doing it the nostalgic way - and level 2 characters, at least in the beginning. Druid will definitely have skining and herbalism, warloc will definitely have mining and hmm... herbalism, definitely, that peacebloom gathering in Elwynn nostalgia is just priceless.
---
Gnome master race
---
Ahh
---
This may be farfetched, but I am looking for a Horde NA RPPVE Guild.
---
Same logic applies to boe drops etc. When a recipe drops that is worth 1000 gold then that recipe could as well be 1000 gold dropping  which then someone claims to have "need" to buy the recipe with after. It is one and the same thing, but for some reason there are players who think a recipe should go to the guy with the profession for it. 
---
I don’t think you realize how much 600g is in vanilla.
---
Engineering is very good. Mining can be taken if you want to farm your own materials for engineering and as a warrior that is not a bad idea. Skinning and herbalism will likely make you more money at max level so you could buy your mats by farming those. Enchanting is also decent as you can disenchant everything from the get go.  
---
And you don‘t even get XP for it...
---
top kek
---
&gt;  expensive and you still need to buy the other mount.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Wonder who laughs last.
---
Not like you need half of them though, especially while levelling. Then once you have the mount you have a bunch of small rewards as you buy up each spell to max level!
---
Love that artwork.
---
All heil Profit Skeram.
---
Yeah it’s ridiculous. I’m a mage and I want to get the freezing band which is a BoE drop but if it drops, I shouldn’t automatically get to have it since I’m basically asking for hundreds of gold. 
---
In my country it should be 2 weeks but it rarely ends up being the case cause we are deep in the swamp and some take it when they're told others do not take it at all, depends on your job.
---
It feels stupid too; you do it out of reflex and then immediately realize, "I'm an idiot".
---
Saw you're a Swede as well. I get 30d/year as well but I can save up to 10d/year max and since I've been here for a while now I got some days left. I get overtime at my work as well and can take that out as I please too. So if I get 8 hours overtime i can take a day off from it etc.
---
I'm the same.  I got activated so hard that I'm playing (and enjoying) BFA.... wtf
---
Resto druids can tank pre raid content, you just have to equip def items.
---
Hunter mainly because of the 'huntard' stigma, needing to waste bag space and gold for ammo/pet food, doing so many hours of research on pet abilities, keeping said pet well maintained for more damage when other classes just pop a cooldown.
---
This one made me laugh.
---
On a serious note, it's one thing to be completely invested in your career and fiance, but if you don't learn how to have fun and enjoy life, then a life of work is all you'll ever know.
---
Indeed and congrats :). 
---
Great explanation.  Thank you.
---
Private servers are configured uncorrectly with 10x easier to get gold, rare items, rare materials, a lot higher spawnrate and droprate on EVERYTHING and you can't seriously compare the two.
---
Ofc a private server with 10k active players work out when it's configured to handle 10k players at the same time. We'll not get that, we'll get a server correctly configured like vanilla was and is supposed to be.
---
2.5k players were PLENTY. You had to play at really odd hours to not bumb into people, and it also made the community a lot tighter on the server.
---
Higher cap would ruin a lot, if you can't see that you've been quite blinded by the private servers.

You don't need power infusion as a level 60 priest. If you saw a video recommending power infusion every pull it was probably targeted at leveling priests because they need it to survive until they get the last rank of holy nova at 60.

Thanks, I appreciate it :)

Vacation Game. Same here.

Azeroth is cheaper to explore than the real world and flying is significantly cheaper. Plus it's fun as heck.

Nuts. It’s almost like the more ads you see the worse game will be now. It almost implies they’ve given an inordinate amount of resources to marketing instead of dev
---
You left out the apparent lack of any level cap and that even at high levels you still have to duel to fight your own faction. 
---
Claims backed up by nothing doesn't really do much to persuade.
---
And I do remember how sparse the population was on vanilla servers and how long you could go without meeting a single soul. On high cap pservers there is always people to meet and interactions to be had in your MMO.

Yep, I see it on live and just smile. I know at that point what type of player I am facing.

Didn't have it in 2004 so not gonna download it now.  Raise your weapon skills on your own, you filthy meleer.

Since you were able to in vanilla and they are 3 different item ID's you should be able to hold all 3.

I think mages can use seperate mana gems because of the diffrent names. Healthstones are unique aswell but share a name and are unique aswell so I guess no.

Generally speaking, I agree with you.  That's why I said "arguably".  It's not an argument I support, but it is an argument that exists.

For sure. Phasing is awful too. I reported the following to Blizz and they've ignored it so far:

:crossed\_swords:️ \*\*&lt;No Plan Required&gt;\*\* is an \*\*EU Alliance\*\* guild that intends to roll on a\*\* PvP \*\*server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
\*\*What to expect\*\*
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it.
---
Although we are strictly against approaching the game with a crazy min-maxing mindset, we still hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week. Unorthodox specs such as Retribution and Feral are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
\*\*Classes/specs in demand:\*\* 1-2 Tanks, Resto Druid, Fury Warrior, Holy Paladin, 1 SPriest (We are still accepting other ones though.)
---
We often hang out &amp; play internet games once or twice a week for fun.
---
Raid dates: To be decided
---
Raid times: 7:50 PM GMT

I see
---
&gt; The linchpin of the entire argument is that people didn't use consumes in retail Vanilla. Greater Stoneskin Potion alone is almost as much armor value as BiS shield. This doesn't include world buffs, flasks, other consumes, all of which will be standard for "any tank of note."
---
&gt; People in Vanilla simply didn't use consumes or wbuffs. Again, did you even watch the video, or are you just repeating the common misconception?
---
It'll be interesting to see how much raiders will use consumables once Classic is released.  Because like you said; until Naxx came out raiders for the most part didn't use consumables except for resistance pots on specific fights.  But the fact that you can stack them in Classic unlike modern WoW means there's just *so many* buffs you can stack farming for all that gets to be a huge chore.  I doubt anyone but the most hardcore raiding guilds are going to go through all the effort just to enable a tank to dual-wield instead of sword-and-board.  And also, think of the healers.
---
Gonna be very interesting to see how this all plays out.

&lt;Always East&gt; | Semi-Hardcore | PvP | Server Region: NA, but all are welcome! | Faction: Alliance
---
ABOUT US:
---
"From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East." Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are &lt;Always East&gt;; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: "Be excellent to each other!!" Here are some of the basics of &lt;Always East&gt;.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role.
---
- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?
---
- Current plan is to raid twice a week; Wednesday and Thursday (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
- Raiding will START (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than 8:15PM EST.
---
- Raid will have a 10 MINUTE BREAK around 10:00PM EST for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
- Raid will END no later than 11:45PM EST.
---
- It cannot be stressed enough: "Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours." Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. Please reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460 or Kegg#8900) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you! Orders stand: “Be Excellent!”
---
Reach out if you have questions!

Yeah dafuq? That's BfA!

I did the same thing once I knew classic was coming back. Went and played a class and role (priest, healer) I had no interest in on a pserver and quickly discovered that I love raiding, regardless of what i'm playing!
---
Can not wait for classic!!
---
Its not about that dude...
---
Just started doing the exact same thing lol
---
aw yiss
---
You can kinda force that reaction in a lot of people too. If I sap someone and then Garrote without auto hitting them, they know I'm attacking them and they can't move so I guess the brain will just see the fact they're being "hit" and not able to move as stunned, making them use trinket. On literally nothing.

I did a search, couldn't find it already posted

Have my upvote.

&gt; Just earlier last week we were getting DM buffs, at the entrance of DM:N summoning people in, and there was a rival faction guild doing the same and it turned into this massive king-of-the-hill battle where we were each trying to secure the DM:N entrance area so we don't get killed and lose our buffs. Was extremely fun. Then we smashed KT in Naxx.
---
Good god, I remember this.  I barely remember what those buffs were (there was like one for strength, one for agility, one for spellpower, and one for stamina?) but I remember camping outside of DM north to help people get buffed.  
---
My only point was that it’s mainly just about the time. A lot of people don’t want to spend extra time when buffs speed it up so much. Many of us are older now.
---
The key to a successful raiding guild is organization. If a guild isn’t organized, it tends to fall apart. Part of organization is world buffing, another part is an organized approach to loot, and so on.
---
Plenty of people don’t want to raid. I totally get that. Back in 2004-2006 tons of people didn’t raid, and it will be the same this time around. Tons will enjoy leveling slowly over a year or two, whether because of lack of time or other reasons.
---
Personally, my preferred play style is go ham to 60 as fast as I can, then take it easy with a few hours of organized raiding a few times a week. But I totally respect and appreciate that many others play the game very differently.

Other way round. Playing a mage and gonna heal in classic.
---
If you replace money with time, it works.
---
Paladin is, after all, the best class bar none for plumbing the depths of internet pornography while leveling your character. 
---
I fought depression for 5 years 18-23 and I won cause I relied on me getting stronger and it was a sense of pride to defeat it without getting help from who knows if good pros.
---
In my group Wow classic is a meme as much as Diablo Immortals. It's a thing we use when we want to reference something that drains huge amount of time for obtaining little achievement. (Pls don't freak out it's just irony).
---
Still we will all go and try it out (again) once it comes out.
---
Seal of Command is pretty much the go-to for level 20+
---
And seal / judge / seal -------(8 sec)-------- judge / seal is the norm rotation.
---
Haven't looked into prot leveling too much, cause the damage is quite low. There's some guides out there that recommend it, but they rely on exploits that won't be possible in classic, so it's a slower method typically.
---
Do you know of a list of pre-MC fire resist gear for bear tanks?
---
aah game time, right
---
Lol you’re on about Russian collusion? You know Richard Burr, the chairman of the senate intelligence said there is no evidence of Russian collusion with trump. This was after a 2 year investigation. I wouldn’t expect an NPC who reads the NYT to listen to this though.  Top kek
---
600 is cheaper than 1,000.

But how will Actiblizzard moentize everything if they did that? Why a single player NOT buying the books to learn the lore...inconceivable!
---
Blink on E disagrees
---
is this a modified r/SrGrafo art?
---
I've played both but alliance never say anything and all horse seem to ever do both in game and on here is whine about allies.
---
Given the amount of "loktar all allies must die" bellends I'm going to hazard a guess that you haven't discovered a magical factionbased behavioural divide
---
This is really the best way to play. You've gotta create a connection between yourself and your character and play out WoW like you're reading a book. Just pick it up when you can and put it down when you have too. I'm rolling a warrior specifically because my attention span to leveling likely won't last longer than 3 hours and it will be easy for me to make friends for dungeons. 
---
25g is a conservative estimate, and doesn't hinge on server economy. A good portion of that will be from vendoring grey drops.
---
No. It's just the Allies that are normal. Only hordes are assholes.
---
&gt;is there even an Ally equivalent where they are surrounded by opposite faction friendly mobs?
---
no, because Allies don't play on some Chinese private servers where opposite faction mobs are friendly.
---
Not really. You're overvaluing human racials.
---
I's say /camp
---
but only if you're not in resting area
---
and then Greater Healthstone, Lesser Healthstone, etc?
---
Ah yeah, we have "flex" at a maximum of 20 hours, so I can work 20 hours extra and take 20 hours off with pay. Instead of getting more money from working extra. I just though he had like 40 days a year regular vacation :d
---
You will want to 40 man raid for gear because it is the best and relatively easiest to get.
---
You have two options. Roll fury and DPS or roll Prot and tank.
---
A 40 man raid honestly only needs 2 dedicated Prot warriors. The rest can be DPS spec and can offtank stuff fine with the right gear.
---
The problem with Arms DPS is not that the DPS is bad, because it is OK, not quite as good as Fury. But the debuffs that Arms applies can be troublesome with limited debuff slots. You will apply Mortal Strike and Deep Wounds which are 2 unwanted and useless debuffs. Once raids are on farm they probably won't care about such debuffs.
---
Orc Warrior is the best.
---
Works well in PvE and best racial for pvp
---
On the internet.
---
:P

---
YEAH SURE MILLY JUST LET ME PUT ON MY 8 BAZILLION HEIRLOOM ITEMS JUMP IN MY HELICOPTER AND.. OH DUNGEON Q POPPED CYA.
---
You can say all you want but the truth is vanilla was caped at 2500 and aditional player where in queue til someone DC, ideal for me is as much as possible, i played on 16k (online ) pop on nostalrius and it was the best fkin pvp and easy way to find group. if they cap server at 2500 it will be catastrophic.
---
This literally has nothing to do with Classic wow other than terminology that is used, and that is a pretty loose connection considering it's used in almost every online video game ever. I don't understand why this is posted here or is allowed 
---
NA, PVP, Alliance
---
I've got two kids and want to raid eventually but honestly I'd be happy with running dungeons and just pvping, having fun.
---
Really just want to find a guild with other parents.  My second son is coming in like a week and a half so I'll have a pretty young kid for most of classic and despite wanting to spend 4 hours running MC or hell, even BRD for 4 hours, I may have to bail or stop for a bit.
---
Generally just looking for like-minded parents on a PVP server.  Alliance is a must.
---
You could be right, and 6+ could be fairly empty.
---
But current retail with full sharding -and- phasing in effect, as well as dynamic respawns, shared drops, very fast lootable respawns, etc they're VERY different beasts. My BFA rush was similar, quick and easy, but no reason not to be prepared. If 6 is dead, quest normally in dead. If it's slightly crowded, cool I've got 4 more levels of prep.
---
Claims backed up by everyone, even the Nost team, which have all said they're making shit up like boss armor and a lot of other config settings since the base server database didn't have those set.
---
They've also all updated the spawn rates to be a lot higher, as well as green and rare loot drops along with rare materials.
---
I played on 2 different servers in vanilla, a high pop PvP server. Tyr's hand, some places in Silithus, good cloth or herb farming spots and BRM was full out war almost every night because 2.5k  people are a lot. I remember this well, because my guild was kind of a "W-PvP group for hire". Other progressing guilds hired us to defend them while farming.
---
Also played on a normal pop RP server, and still met a lot of people while lvling, all over the world. 
---
I'm still convinced you're quite blinded by the private servers. But if you don't trust me, trust every private server developer there is. The server are tweaked to host a higher population.
---
600 is an arbitrary number as an example. The point is that farming something doesn't make it cheaper because you still lose out on not selling the mats either way.
---
Both sides definitely have their assholes. The situation reminds me of a saying: "There is only one thief in the army, everyone else is just trying to get their shit back."  
---
I think a lot of people do it as vengeance for having it done to them, except they can't usually target the culprit, so their faction pays the price. It creates a vicious cycle. 
---
I'm not sure where you get the impression that Hillsbrad is a horde hub surrounded by alliance. It was always fairly even when I went there. Stranglethorn on the other hand, was always a murderfest and the lack of a decent alliance base made it heavily horde favored.   
---
As far as Stonetalon, I never knew many alliance who could even find the place, much less try to quest there. It wasn't exactly on the easy to travel routes for leveling and most who did only went there if they had class quests that required it. 
---
Could be server differences though. My entire vanilla experience was as alliance on Dunemaul.
---
No I'm on about the campaign finance felony Trump directed Cohen to commit which is in the Grand Jury documents if you had bothered to read, thus making Trump a felon aka Individual Number 1.
---
I'm done arguing with idiots for the day, I'm on vacation. If you want you can find me tomorrow and I can keep pointing out how ridiculous your little cult is.

&gt;It actually baffles me when people say they will take mining to save them money on engineering
---
I'll be doing just that, the low gold-per-hour is misleading because I'll be mining as I run around levelling - if I spot a node I'll get 2-4 ore for maybe an extra 20 seconds work.

I'm going to ship my newborn off to Germany and play from the minute I get home till late at night.

Yet, you will still ask if you can have it.

And you can.

4 people just gained a friend and unlimited food/water, and you gained an item worth some 700g, and 4 friends.
---
Welcome to classic!
---
just choose neither of them
---
It's like comparing colors when you're blind.
---
Those also all have 3 different versions. You would be able to hold all of those at the same time. They still all trigger the same cooldown.
---
If I was in the group and a valuable item dropped I think everyone should just roll need 
---
Now it is Sha-ma'am
---
the first mmorpg that blizzard made around 2004 is called World of Warcraft.
---
And I'm hoping that WOW Classic will too be called World of Warcraft, or at least will have the old logo, not Classic's recolor.
---
&gt; I've played both but alliance never say anything and all horse seem to ever do both in game and on here is whine about allies.
---
Seems like that implies it is the Allies being assholes in the game thinking they're roleplaying the "heros".
---
World buffs you won't have in classic due to different internal timers. Boss armor values and resist values that are complete guesses. Flasks you won't have because Black Lotus is much rarer in real Vanilla.
---
Nothing to see here.
---
&gt; no, because Allies don't play on some Chinese private servers where opposite faction mobs are friendly.
---
Uh, what?  The Hillsbrad humans are all alliance tagged, always have been.  So they can freely fuck with any Horde questing there.
---
What a relief to have this point clarified!
---
some people like the nightly dick wolf rapery hence so many apologists for lootboxes
---
If you've only ever played Horde, then it's kinda obvious why you'd think that only Alliance are jerks.
---
tl;dr: they're all jerks.
---
Damn I was not ready for this. It was fun chasing Kinetic for the brief period when we (Final Countdown) were on their heels!

And now youre all playing a mock stock market game. Have fun?

**&lt;For Fun&gt; - EU - Horde - PvP Server - Casual Raiding Guild**
---
**Raid Times**
---
Wednesday and Saturday: 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET) 
---
You are not required to make both raid days every week. We respect that you will have commitments in real life and understand that comes first!
---
**Introduction**
---
For Fun is going to be a more casually and social orientated raiding guild as Horde on a PvP server. This means we will raid and aim to clear all content, but on a more relaxed schedule and mindset. This means we accept people of any class or spec, even if it’s considered sub-par. The social aspect of the guild is also very important to us. For too long on retail the sense of community has died in the game and it is a shame. We hope to remake the original sense of community within our guild so even if you don’t raid, you have a home where you can have fun and make friends. There will be social events like hide and seek, fashion competitions, catfish dules and also a Stormwind streaking competition, all with prizes! We also have set up a retail guild on Emeriss Horde if you would like to come and hang there! Most of us rerolled without heirlooms and hope to get to know each other before Classic comes out.
---
**Expectations**
---
A casual and relaxed raid environment.
---
A friendly atmosphere both in and outside of raids.
---
Social events available for all guild members at any level (with prizes!).
---
An experienced and mature leadership team.
---
A “for fun” attitude to everything in the game. That is what games are for after all!

As a paladin, you should be doing Protecting the Herd at level 8/9 and get Coldridge Hammer, which at 8.3DPS is one of the best weapons available before level 10 or so, aside from random BOE greens.
---
Alternatively, there's a 9.0DPS white level 10 mace available for 26s in SW, though you might not be able to afford it quite yet, and 8.3 with 1str is pretty close.
---
The quest reward mace is fine for leveling 10-14 or so, at which point I plan on picking up a 12+ DPS vendor weapon until 18/20 when I get Orc Crusher or Verigan's Fist.
---
Why would a server need higher drop rates to accommodate for a higher population if it already is increasing spawn rates?
---
Now, to ask the moderators. WHY has this not been removed?
---
I've uploaded a screenshot from another game, showing a copy-pasted quest text from the first Human starting zone quest.
---
A moderator removed it, because "it's not related to WOW Classic". 
---
I appealed, saying that it is the quest text from the first human quest - and the moderators said no, that it is a different game.
---
Now, following the same path of reasoning, this is a screenshot from retail WOW, so it's too a different game and "unrelated to WOW Classic", .
---
Not to mention that it fits perfectly into the "low-quality meme" definition.

&lt;Sanguine Hibiscus&gt; NA - Alliance - PvP
---
Introduction: Sanguine Hibiscus is a casual raiding guild organized by vanilla veterans with an emphasis on community and cooperation. For us, WoW is a platform for social interactions and shared experiences. 
---
How we play: While leveling, we will run dungeons, share group quests, and help each other get attunements. At 60, we will establish raid and BG events on weekends (both optional). Our top priority as guild officers will be to groom and gear a consistent and comfy raiding team and make steady progress through the content.
---
Raid loot and schedule: We use a modified version of the "Suicide Kings" loot system with separate lists for tier gear, weapons, and other epic gear. For details, visit the “About the Guild” page on our website. We are tentatively scheduling raids on Saturdays at Noon EST and may add an additional raid time on Sunday afternoon (depending on interest and pace).
---
What we want: We are recruiting all classes and all levels of experience. If you have friends or family who are playing, they are welcome to join. All we ask is that you play the game now and then.
---
Finally, whether or not you are interested in our guild, feel free to browse one of our officers comprehensive Classic WoW guide, linked on our website (made in Google spreadsheets). This guide includes pre-raid gearing lists, a world map, profession guides, and more (constructive feedback is much appreciated).

Honestly, LFD isn't the worst. Its the unholy trinity of cross server dungeons, heirlooms, and lfd that make a truly faceless, forgettable social experience. LFD on its own (no teleporting), using only your server, and without heirlooms in game would just..... pair you with people in queue. The rest would play out fine. 
---
I don't. I hate them both. I said WOTLK would be more popular because the mini games were more polished and casual players actually have stuff to do in WOTLK. They had nothing to do in TBC.
---
TBC is not casual friendly. It's the expansion that ruined peoples lives. Vanilla is very casual friendly (outside rank 14 which is in no way needed or required and will only be done by mentally ill people and streamers in Classic because BG's are delayed until BWL). WOTLK is very casual friendly but in different ways. Vanilla engineering can mean more than gear, blue pvp set is easy to get and relevant. AV gear is easy to get and relevant. With WOTLK they had stupidly easy starter raids, catch up gear with Wintergrasp bosses, badge gear, dailies for the heroics and on and on.
---
Vanilla was the term by the community, because in ice cream "Vanilla" is basically "plain."  So it was WoW before any expansions.
---
Classic is the official term by the company, because "Vanilla" sounds like a nickname.
---
I agree with the others: Vanilla is the long-lost era and Classic is the redo.
---
Well aimed shot is talent, maybe some hunters only wanted arcane shot :)

Me, as well

\*\*Real Men of Genius\*\* \[Horde\] / \[NA\] / \[9p-1a CST days TBD\]
---
Real Men of Genius aims to be a cohesive, active guild that clears all content in short order.
---
The guilds that actually accomplish their goals are those that have a mixture of cohesion, stability and performance. It does no good to kill Ragnaros on week 1 of release and have the fastest MC clear if your guild falls apart after two months of a raid leader's autistic screeching. Needless to say, a guild also isn't going to go very far if they can't perform well enough to clear content. In RMoG, we intend to foster a community that avoids both of these pitfalls.
---
Goals:
---
\- clear all content (quickly)
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement, not raidlogging
---
If you want to have fun, clear content, be a top guild on the server and not just raidlog, then join us here: [https://discord.gg/u48mBEn](https://discord.gg/u48mBEn)
---
p.s. This guild was started by a couple of world pvp enthusiasts. If the real end-game in your mind is asserting your dominance over the opposite faction, this is the guild for you.
---
If you want to level as a ret pally, I suggest putting most of your points in ret.
---
I wouldn't call it being casual. The dungeons being hard isn't the same as the game having a huge time commitment.
---
In other words: Playing for.... oh idunno 6 hours a week? That doesn't restrict you from questing, soloing, doing dungeons, and slowly getting to max level. So, tough dungeons can fit right into that dynamic.
---
I think we need a new word for the group of people who need extra hand holding, are exceptionally impatient, who dislike real challenges and need shiny things to be thrown at them constantly. 
---
To be fair, if you the [world first Kel'Thuzad kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A), you'll see that it's filmed from the perspective of a fury warrior who randomly fights in Battle Stance for no discernible reason, continually lets his rage sit at 100 while Whirlwind is off cooldown (losing like 4-5 seconds worth of rage from melee attacks after every Bloodthirst), doesn't use intercept to improve DPS uptime, and it takes him like half a second to press Bloodthirst when it goes off cooldown (not a matter of latency, just watch the button press visual effect).
---
&gt; And the real answer ALWAYS is, you want a mage alt to grind gold.
---
How do efficiently you farm gold with a mage?
---
I will fully decline if the guild nominates me as guild &lt;insert profession&gt;  
---
No way.
---
Gad-jet-zan and Gad get zan in hearthstone, as well. I'm no stickler for pronunciations (all people pronounce something wrong, usually unknowingly), but the inconsistency was weird.

did I mention Orc?
---
If you are talking about northda**e the server has a 60/40 population in ally favor. So you will be running into more ally who want to PvP than horde who will help you pvp. From my years playing on private servers I can confidently say horde generally has more griefers out in the world to gank or farm honor. That server is just an exception to the rule. 
---

---
Also Lord of the Clans was a sick book that gives Thrall backstory. Fucking great read
---
Too many Rs. Its like saying Februrary, imagine saying Februrary, now imagine saying FREBRuary.
---
Now, imagine saying Fre - brur - rary. Thats how saying Orgrimmar feels....... sometimes.
---
Righteousness.
---
Though I've always been curious about Seal of the Crusader. Like... it adds AP (which should increase damage) while hastening attack speed. But somehow it normalizes damage so you have the same DPS, just faster swings... so why add AP in the first place?!?!
---
It’s part of the game. The dopamine hit you get from making hundreds of gold from good trades on the AH is almost as good as getting that epic drop from a raid. It’s a nice feeling
---
This is probably the stupidest misconception that exists in WoW; that one faction or the other is reasonably more &lt; personality trait&gt; than the other.  
---
Always felt weird going straight to fighting Blackrock orcs. Can't imagine a fresh blood adventurer fairing well.
---
Blacksmith
---
You still have to overgear the content to be able to 2hand or DW tank. Your #1 job as a tank is to not die and you'll be severely gimping yourself without a shield.
---
I've 2hand tanked plenty and you are going to take a noticeable increase in damage.
---
I can understand once you overgear content you will be taking so little damage that your rage is then reduced which then reduces your threat output. In that situation switching to 2hand or DW is appropriate and preferred to generate more threat.
---
Awesome, too bad they don't have flightpoint information.
---
Usually other side is assholes. 
---
Ok,  yes, but the quest giver despawns for 2 hours if you fail, and even with Spirit Tap it can be tricky, so I would expect some trouble in finding her in the first few months after everyone hits 60 and starts progression. 
---
Hype boiled over in Nov and I joined a pserver. Still binging on Classic Videos and Podcasts when ever there's something good from the Classic content creators.  
---
Agreed. I just want classic man. Im on this sub every day. Just give me the game.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server.

Dire maul farming isn’t gonna be like pservers
---
/camp didn’t work that way in vanilla and the only way you’re gonna get back out and in is to die hitting repair bill or manually run back out and reset
---
This. It´s a solved game what is there to pretend? 
---
It was, but they shared same cd(health and mana stones), so. 
---
You know what bothers me most about this idea? These people who pick up herbalism/mining and just “pick up nodes on the way” except they’re not factoring in the total time they spend and equating it to an amount of money.  
---
Same fallacy applies when people believe farming for their mats for whatever they’re going to craft makes it ‘free’. 
---
Sounds advice, but I'm curious if it actually pays to pick skinning at the lower levels. Considering people will likely vendor the leather, due to the AH being stuffed, I'm not sure the leather is worth the time spent skinning, compared to leveling slightly quicker, and spending that time grinding in the higher levels.
---
I know. It’s like those people who think if they craft Nature runes on Runescape and high alchemy yew longs, they are getting money.  No, you are losing money because you could have sold everything for more than the high alchemy value! 
---
I don't remember which but a flask recipe in UBRS dropped worth almost 1000g on our server and some guy in our (PuG) group claimed to be his guild's designated flask maker and that it should go to him. Everyone passed but I thought that was bullshit considering we are handing him 1000g in a PuG so I rolled need and won. Guy flipped out on me and called me a ninja since I can't use it. Ended up getting my epic mount from that.
---
This wasn't his group, it wasn't a guild group, there were no prior agreements. I think that guy was trying fleece everyone for a free recipe and I didn't bite.
---
Tried to join it not working, could you add me on discord and send me a link that way. Ghostyboy#0001
---
Who the fuck is able to play 50 hours on release and then 18+ hours every day until lvl 60. Even with that much playing itll take you 5 days. Even if youre able to do it, itll be really difficult to find someone else playing mage and wanting to destroy their body.
---
Could you take off your gear to avoid a repair bill?
---
considering that redridge is pretty much unplayable on a mature server i'm gonna have to say no. 
---
No they're just not 12 and don't take to making poorly written forum posts regarding the perceived ethical shortcomings of the other side.
---
My advice as a moderator is to never lawyer the rules.
---
Might even be profitable to pay to level alchemy to 275 ASAP after securing your lvl 40 mount, just so you can start doing the arcanite bar transmutes as quickly as possible.
---
I can see a slowpoke.jpg meme somewhere here. 
---
In the vanilla human intro it says the armies are gone and the very citizens are called upon to defend Stormwind and Elwynn Forest. 
---
This translates as you being some peasant or lower class worker given a sword and told to go fight. 
---
Can't imagine them faring too well against orcs.

# &lt;Always East&gt; 
---
**Semi-Hardcore | PvP | Server Region: NA, but all are welcome! | Faction: Alliance**
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;**...
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week; Wednesday and Thursday (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than 8:15PM EST.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around 10:00PM EST for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than 11:45PM EST.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. Please reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460 or Kegg#8900**) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you! Orders stand: ***“Be Excellent!”***

I still can't get over the fact they've made creatures in starting locations neutral in WotLK :l
---
Like. Why.
---
Shame he died in the battle of five armies though. 
---
Same here
---
Was a Vanilla Warlock, this definitely will work.
---
FinancialAssistant, I insist, you don't "lose" 600g but "spend" it. If it were lost it would not have become anything.
---
&gt; I nearly cried in frustration when they gave Nef's Tear to a mage
---
In fairness, Neltharion's Tear is BiS for mages (along with the Restrained Essence of Sapphiron) as well as warlocks.  And when BWL was first released, mages didn't yet have the +hit talent IIRC.
---
Though as much as it pains me to admit it, since we're getting 1.12 talents when Classic launches Nelth's Tear should be slightly higher priority to warlocks if loot distribution is being totally optimized.  Let's just be glad Nelth's Tear is mostly just between us mages and you locks, and that we don't have to deal with drama over who gets priority on the Drake Fang Talisman.  
---
(Also, if you *really* want to make my blood boil, give the Azuresong Mageblade to a filthy paladin over some needy mage or warlock.  Says MAGE right in the name, you disgusting pinko.  That sword DOES NOT belong to you!)
---
Basic economics would teach a lot of people some very simple things in these games. 
---
Tbh Shah-men is a very American pronunciation. In British English and by most Europeans in the same field as me it is pronounced more like Shay-men (a mix of the two).
---
No idea but go play on any pserver. You will loot 8 6-slot bags before lvl 8. In vanilla, it was a good idea to take tailoring just to create linen bags and drop it for your real profession.
---
 You will loot green items, blue items hell a lot more.
---
Through this, even if you don't sell at AH, you will have a ton more gold. Farming at lvl 60 increases your gold per hour by a lot etc.
---
Why? I dunno. I don't run a private server. But I guess it's to get the economy going faster and easier.
---
Private servers can't be compared to vanilla because it's too different, even if it's close to what it was.
---
If you buy 600g worth of mats from someone you don't lose 600g because now you have 600g worth of mats. 
---
The gold is truly only lost when you spent it on the quest. Therefore it doesn't matter if you farmed the mats or bought them, same amount of gold is lost at the point of using them on the quest.
---
Sounds like you're taking it a bit personally?
---
I thought you meant lore-wise, and was about to get into a lengthy discussion. Then I realized you meant gameplay-wise, and now the question becomes a lot easier to answer.
---
Yes. The Horde have griefers too. The Undead are practically kill-on-sight due to their hyper-aggression towards anything attackable. Tauren outside of Druids are usually pretty chill (yet Tauren Druids are also by-and-large aggressive as well, always thought that to be odd).
---
Trolls and Orcs are wildcards, though I notice Hunters like to attack often.
---
People psychologically value not losing money over gaining money.
---
See this is where you're wrong, Blink goes on R and Counterspell goes on C
---
There are enough Mages
---
the best pvp racial in the game is to have paladin by yourside and no paladins on the other side. everybody knows this.
---
also the 90% of a good tank weapons are swords, daggers and maces, and only very few axes. which makes human more beneficial from that side. here is [the spreadsheat of all tank 1h weapons progressions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS8tQpCaT_vaVnEejSjovH_5WQNJuaeuJX3Ne4FFSzD5E_JqwdsESe3QG7NCWZ37aoUDxSxg4jVlxv_/pubhtml#), click melee weapons on top, and look at "type"  column.
---
Cooking however is really easy to make money from while you level, simple as saving all the cooking meat drops from killing mobs
---
Who were you in FC, I was in frostmane guild before kinetic 
---
In real Vanilla Mage was better for tier 1 and 2 and usually most of AQ because locks didn't get the best stuff because mages did so much more dmg. Kind of how like warriors weren't seen as good dps until LATE AQ 40 because all the best DPS items were going to rogues in progression guilds. 
---
**In Classic IF 16 debuffs holds for tier 1 and 2 (was 8) and IF itemization holds then they should be really close for all of Vanilla.** I don't think threat will play that big a role because Tier 1 and 2 as is stands atm on Classic are nerfed pretty heavily. So warriors will simply use better dps gear tanking. 
---
**All this could change.** They could go back to 8 debuffs for tier 1 and 2, they could change itemization, and heals would be less efficient in worse gear, time to kill longer, tank takes more dmg. If all that happened mages would dominate locks for those tiers. Locks are still needed though for utility. Locks in no way do less damage in pvp though or 1 v 1 or in 5 mans (they actually can do a lot more in 5 mans if the healer is good).
---
I expect all this stuff will be announced before launch. Ranged almost always have a easier time getting a spot than melee though. I wouldn't stress it. If you want to play lock, play lock. Rogue is going to be the hard class to get a spot with to be honest. Too many people think 1.12 rogues = 1.1.
---
Of course doing something is better than doing nothing. But why not just do the most efficient thing and save yourself time for other things? People only have a certain amount of hours to play each week after all and a lot of people are interested in maximising value.
---
NA - PVP - EST  LFG for me and 3 others
---
Myself and one other are looking to play very hardcore at launch, get to 60 &amp; grind dungeons ASAP, etc. Both private server veterans.  Other two are more casual, both experienced WoW players but Vanilla noobs with more limited schedules.
---
We're looking to raid &amp; PVP, preferably a guild that does not raid on weekends or after midnight EST.
---
Feel free to dm me on discord, Thickjames#5557
---
Maybe you've played on different private servers than me, but that has not been my experience, one time I think I hit lvl 20 with only a single bag having dropped.
---
Sometimes I might get 3 BoE rares in 30 lvls other times I'll get nada.
---
Well atleast you got a laugh out of it;)
---
Of course I will help you out, Milly. I also remember the good old d-
---
*Vanishes out of site because phasing shifted them to a less busy shard*
---
My dad was! Maybe that's where it came from
---
&gt;never lawyer the rules
---
what?
---
Yeah, the point is to vendor it all. its good money, and will basicly just help you reach your 40 mount easier. Also to keep you from buying/crafting stupidly expensive minor upgrades while leveling tailoring.. :D
---
You dont need to go out of your way for skinning, just skin the mobs youd normally skip that are skinnable in quests and stuff
---
OK. This is a real achievement, gz!
---
&gt; Mages and warlocks literally hate each other because they share all the bis loot and mage is constantly talking down on warlocks.
---
It goes deeper than that, my friend.
---
You see, a mage is a Man of the People.  A beloved and valued member of his community, the mage spends years studying at the finest Academies in Azeroth to harness the power of the magic arts and puts them to use for the benefit of his people.  He uses his arts to feed the hungry, hydrate the thirsty, send people to distant shores in a moment's time, and when necessary, harness the destructive power of the elements to defend his home and community.  The mage is respected and admired by all.
---
Contrast that with the warlock.  The warlock is nothing but a 2nd-class caster skulking in the shadows practicing his debased craft.  The warlock, too lazy and inept to harness the powers of magic through his own efforts, bargains with foul entities - performing despicable acts on their behalf - in order to be given that which he could not obtain on his own.  Unable and unwilling to contribute anything positive of his own, the warlock is rightly shunned and despised by all.  
---
That's not how vanilla works. Mobs are player/group-tagged, not faction-tagged.
---
So, for non-raid quests, up to 5 players can share a tag.
---
If there are so many players, that all monsters are tagged, than Alliance players suffer equally.
---
Sorry to break it to you, but the crown icon you are referring to on your armory has nothing to do with your old PvP rank. [Anyone with a high enough honorable kill count gets it.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/perenolde/Fartzwrgoben/pvp)
---
No player ever attained "City Protector" as far as I know.
---
though, I'd advice your father to not confuse Gnomish with Old Elvish. That can have very bad consequences for his life.
---
Definitely appears to be, and they even add their own website tag to it. Scummy imo
---
Whether as mats or as cash, it still isn't "lost" because, one kind of valuable item, mats or it's medium, cash, is exchanged for another, travel efficiency of a mount. Because the first two things of value were exchanged for another thing of value, I see it as an expenditure and not as a "loss." If either of the first two things were thrown into the Great Sea for no gain or reason, then it would have been lost. I'm just picking apart specific diction is all, it's all just a minor point. 
---
What if we called it Old Jibber Jabber
---
Did some math. Thinking you open with spamming sinister strike, you should get 3 off in 3 seconds (costs 120 energy, 100 start + 20 regen over 2 seconds). Over those 3 seconds, you will do the following damage (ish):
---
Slow weapon (42 dmg, 2.8 speed):
---
45 white damage (15*3)
---
13,8 more SS damage than fast weapon (4,6 per SS)
---
Total: 58,3 damage
---
Fast weapon (37.4 damage, 1.7 speed)
---
66 white damage (22*3)
---
Total: 66 damage
---
After this point you will be out of energy, and the fast weapon will become even better. I didn't run any deep calculations considering all other skills, but this should give some kind of general guideline. The higher dps weapon is simply so much better it outweights the benefit of a slow weapon.
---
Group PvP Alliance and Gnome and Dwarf. Reason? Holy Paladins cleanse and freedom. Decursive mod is simply OP. If it's broken in classic this would be much closer to even. 
---
Solo PvP. Orc, Gnome and Dwarf are all very strong.
---
PVE DPS, Orc and Human, but Orc matters way more. Human is only for early raids that are easy anyways. I would say on Horde you are more forced to be Orc. Rogues are different on Alliance. Human is dominant.
---
PVE Tanking. Troll for threat because threat is all that matters. Human for same reason, but threat isn't as important on Alliance. They are easy mode due to salvation.
---
The O'Jays - Love Train.
---
In a loop while two groups of alliance players that we were, traveled from Ironforge to the Scarlet Monastery by foot.
---
It was a blast, took forever and I do not recommend it.
---
Lmao this sub is so misinformed. Gnome is the best race for every class in the game for PVE and PVP
---
Remember when that was considered a lot of value, and was run in control warrior, among other things? Simpler times.
---
I guess you could print it and use pins+string? Might look cool.
---
don't those titles stay on the server they were earned? at least that was my experience when transferring my vanilla toons in like wrath or cata

Didn't exploit darkshore pvp for honor level 500 too bad
---
Thank you for your detailed response. If I were to roll a Hunter, are there good guides that tell you what you should do once you reach 60 to get yourself in to a raiding position as efficiently as possible? 
---
So noobs don't get owned lol. Their total carebear policy is really bad...
---
Tried explaining to my boss why I wasn't ready to book my summer vacation yet. 
---
Yeah he knows I'm the biggest nerd ever now.
---
I'm sure some people will, but I honestly don't think it matters. Nobody will care who kills what first other than the people who kill it first. I've done world first chases on retail, but Classic doesn't give me that same.desire as I don't think it's a good measure of skill. I suspect the "elite" measure will be speedrunning in Classic.
---
This is some grade A role play writing here. Well done.
---
In terms of dps, Mage.  
---
In terms of finding a guild, Warlock x100 times. (it's still needed for portals, healthstones, soulstones and certain curses, and they are scarce, especially in Alliance).
---
what's that, leper dwarvish?
---
The thing is that AP requires a lot more to actually reduce your TTK on a mob. Getting a crit will always significantly reduce your TTK, whereas having more STR (but not that much overall since it's leveling gear) will not.
---
Neat idea, thanks!
---
I don't think any of those are possible. I'm just going to try and juggle. If I do two nights per week, one when she has an evening class I think it should be ok
---
here we go boys!!!
---
Both factions are assholes.
---
Whenever one faction pulls ahead of 50/50 in terms of population, they tend to be the bigger asshole instigator in pvp
---
For example: When a bunch of YOUR team is roaming the map in STV and you see an enemy faction member stealing your mobs, people are more likely to attack knowing they got backup
---
Personally I love that dance of aggressor / aggressee based on shifting zone population. You only get that in PvP servers
---
Truth is, doesn’t matter whether it’s horde or alliance. People as individuals can be dicks OR helpful. it depends on context
---
Here is the blue post for my people at work:
---
At BlizzCon 2018, we proposed a plan to give Classic four content phases. These were planned to be centered primarily on raid power progression.
---
Currently, based on both your feedback and our own deliberations, we’re now planning to increase it to six phases. Our focus is still primarily on player power-progression, but we’re also aiming to capture what it felt like to play in a realm community in original WoW. To do that, we’re planning to mirror the approach taken by original WoW, with patches paired together. We’ll launch Classic with content from original WoW through patch 1.2.x, then the second update will include content that was in original WoW 1.3 and 1.4, the third Classic update will have 1.5 and 1.6 content, and so on.
---
Our first phase primarily focuses on launching Classic with Onyxia and Molten Core, but we’ve decided to hold off on Dire Maul for a while. Maraudon is still in the first phase, because it was originally released on December 18, 2004, just two weeks after the first player hit level 60, but we recognize that Dire Maul is in a different category. Some of the loot that’s attainable from Dire Maul is so good that it would affect progression through those early raids. We’re also planning to hold off on releasing Kazzak and Azuregos at launch as well, for the same reasons.
---
The next change we’re targeting addresses two concerns. First, Zul’Gurub and Blackwing Lair unlocking at the same time would differ from how they originally came out, and it makes sense to not have gear and enchants from Zul’Gurub available during early progress into Blackwing Lair. Secondly, the Emerald Dragons should be available earlier than the opening of Ahn’Qiraj, as they give us a way to start preparing nature resist gear for some of the encounters in AQ.
---
Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.
---
One example of the many items we’re planning for is: Titanic Leggings, which is a world drop that first appeared in 1.10. We can confirm that it will be controlled by the same content unlock that restricts the other 1.10 loot changes.
---
Here’s what the release order currently looks like:
---
Phase 1 (Classic Launch)
---
Molten Core
---
Onyxia
---
Maraudon
---
Phase 2
---
Dire Maul
---
Azuregos
---
Kazzak
---
Phase 3
---
Blackwing Lair
---
Darkmoon Faire
---
Darkmoon deck drops begin
---
Phase 4
---
Zul’Gurub
---
Green Dragons
---
Phase 5
---
Ahn’Qiraj War Effort begins
---
Ahn’Qiraj raids open when the war effort dictates
---
Dungeon loot reconfiguration: Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes
---
Phase 6
---
Naxxramas
---
Scourge Invasion
---
We haven’t yet determined exactly when phases 2-6 will occur, and PvP content is notably missing from the list above. That’s because we’re still evaluating our options regarding PvP rewards, as they also changed over time (both in power and in terms of which PvP reward items were available).
---
While we can’t elaborate on every detail of every step we’re going to take (yet), we’re here reading all of your questions and we’re going to keep the answers coming.
---
Thank you!
---
World buffs you will still have because 2 reasons:
---
A) It's only Warcheifs and onyxia that has a cooldown.
---
B) People still camped them on private servers even when they had a cooldown. That's why they removed the cooldown because it was a unhealthy and unfun playstyle, and then removed worldbuffs on progression.
---
Also boss armors and resist values are a guess that is completely irrelevant for the video though because he just explained how you can use consumes to get the same armor as you would have with a shield, consumes that people didn't use in vanilla(from his own vanilla raiding experience which seemed quite large).
---
Flasks are much rarer but he also talked about a scenario where a guild used 40 flasks, clearly they weren't as rare.
---
there's MUCH to see here.
---
this is such good news...progressive itemization and concerns addressed for the patch cycles
---
That's not what I mean at all.  The Hillsbrad mobs are all Allied faction, but are quest mobs for Horde.  Meaning that while a Horder player is questing, an Ally can walk right up in the middle of them without being agro'd.
---
I rotate factions with each Fresh server and I can tell you there are assholes on both sides but I've noticed some patterns.       
---
         
---
Alliance teams up to gank more, if you are Horde questing in a zone and encounter two unaffiliated alliance they will most likely still team up and kill you, organized STV murder balls aren't uncommon. It's annoying on any server that is lopsided, you will effectively get zoned out of questing areas without options for fair fights. 
---
       
---
Horde has more individual players (lots of undead rogues) that will constantly and methodically grief you if you are lower level. I can count on one hand the times I've logged out for an Alliance camper, but I often switch to an alt when dealing with Horde. This is probably a product of the boat location being ratchet, but there's way more Mind Control/boat bullshittery from Horde. Redridge is it's own issue as well. 
---
 So it's kind of a pick your poison type thing in my opinion. 
---
[This one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/av9no1/how_many_levels_per_day/) - not quite, but the only one I remember that's similar.
---
Yeeees &lt;3
---
Holy shit, actual news!
---
Imagine being a classic fan and calling people nostalgic for liking TBC, holy fucking shit
---
Yep, its known as loss aversion theory.
---
Actually, you really do play all 3. If I go feral tank in raid there will be plenty of fights where the extra tank isn't needed and I can switch to healing/decurse bot/DPS. Is it optimal DPS? No, but it's better than what a prot tank can offer. The healing wouldn't be that bad, as you don't need a ton of resto talents to be workable, and decursing is a really useful function for you. Druid really becomes viable when you actually use the built in flexibility.
---
You won't be going boomkin any time soon though.
---
Ythsiens was right. We are going to get more than we expected. So heavy itemization modifications so they roll out in a timeframe that makes sense? Check.
---
This project gets better and better every update man.
---
lol me
---
This is not "progressive itemization". Items stats will not be progressing. This is simply time gating certain items like they're doing with content, which is a reasonable compromise.
---
Sorry,but that´s not true,also    
---
**Fartzwrgoben** was well know in vanilla with The plague 2nd and me 3rd for be the most honorable kills on that [time.So](https://time.So) surely  **Fartzwrgoben is also grand Marshall and city protector :)** 
---
Normalized math equation. Skews a few minutes longer than expected the first few levels, but generally about what you might expect due to mob / quest xp at any given point.
---
People who have messaged me for the posters previously have already seen this. If you want to buy one, feel free to get in touch. It's 33x48.
---
This is a lie. Nobody got City Defender, his proof is a crown that plenty of players with high enough HKs have. 
---
This is insanely good news. I cannot be more hyped.
---
Ring the alarum-bell!
---
Delaying dire maul is a big one. 
---
Sui, troll mage ;)
---
"Experts"
---
Let's talk about Barrens, shall we?
---
Haha yup.  Been cornering the market on lower-value stuff on Sporkdale when I see certain things like wicked claw or large fang going super cheap.  Going rate is usually 20s-25s apiece, but sometimes I see a stack of 5 for 20s like.. 10 times.  BUY THAT SHIT and slowly resell.  It takes awhile but like.. a 5x profit margin is nice.  
---
Also been making a lot of money with wool and mageweave cloth (seem to be the most rare?) and it funded my level 40 mount pretty well.  Otherwise as a fresh character on the server, leveling a warrior, I had a lot of trouble saving up gold for the mount despite leaving out about 20g worth of skills and not buying any upgrades (except spending about 5g for the whirlwind axe charms to get it early at level 31).  And I also have skinning/cooking to get easy additional money with no extra investment.  It is rough going. 
---
classic doomsayers absolutely BTFO  
---
&gt; Both factions are assholes.
---
I'll one-up that. PVPers are assholes.
---
Pick Gnome unless you are willing to purposefully put yourself at a disadvantage vs Mages.
---
Shout out frostmane
---
Classic was good, tbc was shit. 
---
People aren’t blinded by nostalgia when looking at classic. They are when they look at TBC.
---
tl;dr: They're going to mirror patch progression in Vanilla but with each phase containing two patches (1.0 through 1.2, 1.3-1.4, 1.5-1.6, etc.). This will result in the following phases:
---
**Phase 1 (Classic Launch)**
---
**Phase 2**
---
**Phase 3**
---
**Phase 4**
---
**Phase 5**
---
**Phase 6**
---
Amazing news
---
[Did this level 19 twink also get grand marshall and city protector?](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/garona/Notna/pvp)
---
No update on pvp, bgs, pvp gear buffs, etc. hopefully they'll specify where those line up in the stages soon!
---
This is basically the same kind of "progressive itemization" as Kr0n0s3 had, items come out the patch they were supposed to, but item stats don't change.
---
We'll have to see what they are gonna though, this is again not final just like it wasn't at blizzcon, they will probably go progressive once they find out just how broken 1.12 Bonereavers edge is :D
---
Can someone who is much more experienced in classic( TBC baby) tell me how much this affects my pre bis list as a priest, and my ability to play shadow? Thank you ❤
---
Huge news! Guess that shows that they really do listen to feedback from the community. 
---
&gt;  I notice Hunters like to attack often
---
              
---
It's just super easy on a PvP server to get a head start on Honor as a hunter if the server launches with Ranks. In certain level brackets there a few classes that simply can't counter hunters if they start with surprise and don't suck, hence the frequency I think.    
---
            
---
I try to keep that in mind sometimes cause I feel like an asshole if I just run around indiscriminately running people over with my wheelchair. 
---
Pretty good, starting to look a LOT like private servers. The patch progression is very similar to n0rthdale, and the itemization is basically what Kr0n0s 3 did. Which is great because these are the better ways to do it.
---
How can you be so fucking hypocritical jesus. 
---
wtf they are actually listening
---
gj blizzard!
---
MUCH better than the original release plan
---
Selfishly I hope we get the broken Bonereavers :P
---
yup they said they'd do that I think in a further post. 
---
You make no sense.
---
Nope. They stuck to your hero as a feat of strength. 
---
Not a useless update and in a timely fashion?  
---
surprisedpikachuface.  
---
On topic:  
---
The Changes they've made to the content release is sick. Just pvp left to figure out. 
---
Yes you should be able to hold on to different versions at the same time as is blizzlike. Obviously you will still have a cooldown that is shared on them.
---
Nothing's been said about progressive itemization, but item gating is huge. Item gating upon itself still leaves certain items being very strong while they're available from the get-go. Notable items such as savage gladiator's chest and BRE come to mind.  
---
This is better than nothing, but certain items will probably have to be looked at following their logic of restricting items that give too big power gains.
---
Uh. I don’t even know what to say to this. Claims without sources. Just kinda whiny. Maybe try one of the PvE servers instead of a PvE one.
---
This made my nipples so fucking hard.
---
unpopular opinion on this sub, but a good workout will definitely keep the depression away
---
The quasi progressive patch design gives me some serious hope that we’ll get to experience pre-BG WPvP as well as original AV. Great news!!
---
Think I need to change my pants. 
---
yasssss
---
There's exactly 0 chance they're going to be progressively changing the stats on items.
---
Will eat my words if it happens.
---
or a crazy motha fuckin Fish!
---
Separated ZG and BWL. Amazing.
---
Ganking only sucks when it's a level 60 on a low level. A level 45 rogue ganking a 43 mage or something is cool and definitely should be a part of the game.
---
Fuck yes
---
This will make progression a lot tougher. But the difficulty still lies mainly in getting good gear, not mechanical skill. But that's not "fixable" in classic anyway.
---
that actually makes sense
---
This is going to make things very very interesting. back to making plans.
---
yup, at the end of the day its all a game, unless you make money off of it 
---
Yeah I didn't mean you will level as smooth as during BfA launch. I'm just saying you can look at BfA launch to see how a normal blizzard launch with sharding looks like and put that into vanilla environment. And it's saying you'll be alone quite quickly if you have practiced before.
---
0% chance it happens. As far as I'm aware, They do not have the data for that, and deliberately changing items just to change them again (and possibly again) in the future is a ton of wasted effort.
---
pretty objective list tbh.
---
Not sure if troll or if the sjws are trying to get their hands on classic.  
---
Either way... bugger off you twat, we got real classic news to discuss.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself. I actually can't wait anymore for classic.
---
A lot. You actually get upgrades from mc. And then you upgrade to blues when dm opens :p
---
 **&lt;The** **Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me
---
Hey guys. It's Tips here.
---
No, you're imagining things. 
---
THEY ARE LISTENING, GUYS!
---
\&gt;  We haven’t yet determined exactly when phases 2-6 will occur 
---
That means they are already decided on release date, and just waiting for the moment to announce it
---
It'd be a nightmare just from a customer service perspective. Imagine the ticket volume for item restoration requests after stat change patches. This seems like the most effective way to include some kind of progression without adding strain on Blizzard's end.
---
All PvPers no matter what context are assholes?
---
Lol, sounds like someone got their ass whooped in wpvp more than a few times
---
or blizz has been known to not keep their words and will see fit to use it again at other events ala AQ event.
---
This is honestly perfect!
---
I just hope they launch with PvP Gear and BGs, even if the rewards are intentionally weaker at the start.
---
Hi, we'll have it out in time for launch, and we're also making a 1-19 sample available pretty shortly. I'll let you know here when it's ready, and I'll pop a post on reddit as well.
---
Told you that this would not be anything you need to worry about!
---
I’ve heard people claiming that, but when I tried to corpserun somewhere on my last pserver, gear in my inventory still took durability hit
---
Can we somehow sticky this as a blue post to the top?  I feel like this is important info!
---
How does delaying Dire Maul work with the Warlock Dreadsteed quest? Can you still do that part?
---
Since when? because for a fact I lost my titles when I transferred, don't have to downvote me because you think I am wrong. 
---
the question is - how much is sharding gonna hold...
---
sure no more competing against 200 but you are still gonna compete against 40-50 folks now, all near sync quest lines as you. 
---
From the blue post:
---
Fucking pumped, the dev team understands vanilla and its community. They took the hard way of introducing content, despite the repercussions.
---
I can't tell if this was just some more [Daily\_bs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Daily_bs) or not but I was actually very insightful. sometimes its all about your mindset, if you can master that you can pull yourself out of depression
---
Thank god,Dire Maul is phase 2.
---
Yep, Sunder and Expose don't stack, that is fixed at pservers for years.
---
Ok... 
---
Figured as much.
---
&gt; Lol, sounds like someone got their ass whooped in wpvp more than a few times
---
Nope. Literally never.
---
Brief thoughts
---
1st tree- benediction
---
2nd tree- parry
---
3rd tree- SoC  -&gt; pursuit of justice -&gt; +crit
---
4th tree-&gt; improved ret aura (could also do 2/5 vindication), finish last 3 points in +crit
---
5th- 2h weapon spec, sanc aura, and 1 filler point in either vindication or improved ret aura
---
6th- vengeance 5/5
---
Might as well take repentance at level 40, but it's not super useful.  Then go into prot
---
1st tier-  redoubt (never use devo aura, at least redoubt can be useful if you are tanking)
---
2nd tier- precision + guardian favor
---
3rd tier- BOK
---
At this point is where things can branch out.  If you are trying to tank (it is possible if you take time to learn how aggro works well and gather an appropriate mix of gear) then improved RF is basically a given.  Then that one extra point can go to defense. 
---
If you aren't planning on tanking at all, put 4/5 into toughness (more armor) after BOK
---
4th tier- improved HOJ, improved Conc aura 2/3
---
Now you're done!  Leveling spec all the way to 60, focusing on 2h weapons and weapon damage as your primary leveling ability.  You will be bored to tears (mostly autoattacking with SOC, rarely judging) but if you are adept at keeping your weapon updated you will have very steady and low-risk killing. 
---
Bear in mind this is not a good end-game spec, but as you level you want to focus on strength versus NPCs with a bit of utility thrown in.  PVP talents should be considered for PVP ret such as eye for an eye and throw vindication out the window and the prot tree would be adjusted as well. 
---
I hope they launch PVP gear and BGs shortly after the release, maybe in Dire Maul patch or a bit earlier
---
Yeah hold on there
---
TLDR;
---
1. Ignore anything from the Dire Maul dungeons as they won't be available at launch. 
---
2. You may also want to check If your BiS items were revamped during the 1.9 - 1.10 AQ patch. Some of these items might have their pre-AQ lower quality stats.
---
Really hope they announce it this month because I want to book my long holidays...and the clock is ticking lol, can't delay it forever.
---
Diplomacy isn't particularly valuable in Vanilla.
---
In TBC, however, where you must grind every fucking rep to exalted/revered, it's a meaningful timesaver.
---
Theyll probably do it on the PvP items. I believe they changed over time.
---
The most positive to come from this is that now Esfand can stop whining about it every five seconds :) 
---
WOW, amazing news, really excited about this now. 
---
I was confused about the pre-1.10 drops bit, I know several items were added but is there a big difference between the drop rates/locations of existing items?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0
---
right click report, sharding, loot system &lt;3
---
For an absolute Vanilla n00b, could someone ELI5 these changes and how they affect things like BiS gear, itemization (Lion Heart pre / post raid BiS???) and general gameplay?
---
IMO they're talking about when the phases will occur relative to the launch date, not specific calendar dates. The absence of Phase 1 in that statement is because they know when Phase 1 will occur, it will occur at launch.
---
I don't think there's anything to read into here.
---
Battlegrounds &amp; PVP rewards with DM or slightly after would be perfect. 
---
holy crap this is some fantastic info
---
Late start huh
---
They're just gonna go and do the exact right thing? 
---
I don't watch his videos at this point but that made me literally lol
---
Is anybody feeling horny?
---
*My plans have been dashed and I need to redo all of them*
---
This is fine actually.
---
Great news!
---
Now address sharding, loot trading, right-click report automated squelch and itemization =).
---
I'd love to see Patch releases based on player progression. 
---
No. The best world PvP happened when shitgrounds weren't out
---
The litte note about PVP gives me hope we will get to play old AV for a while at least.
---
And my Axe! 
---
The English can't even pronounce "derby" correctly (hint: there is no 'a' in there).
---
Yeah, since I was only 10, it was all I could afford with my allowance. A vanilla wow disc with a 60 day game card. :p
---
Now that there's a confirmed schedule and continuity, there's bound to be fresh servers and "seasons". They can't just run this once then leave it at Naxx forever.
---
whats the respawn timer for those items?
---
Thank you so much! It's a quest of mine to find them all in game - this gives me a reference list so I'll know what I'm missing!
---
&gt; IMO they're talking about when the phases will occur relative to the launch date, not specific calendar dates.
---
They haven't said that. They've directly implified phases 2-6, instead of just saying "we don't have the exact timeline". That means something.
---
&gt; I want to book my long holidays
---
I'm going tomorrow
---
Making an entire fake reddit account to have a meltdown over people having fun won't stop us from having that fun, anon. You should join in, I can assure you, you'll have fun. Acting like the other side in a more exaggerated fashion only makes you look as silly as the people you're pretending to be. 
---
No it's just annoying reading incessant shitposts.
---
Removed as a repost.
---
Seeing Blizz mention "patch 1.10" just triggered the 15 year old me playing D2.
---
TipsOut is creaming rn. Great news btw.
---
it's difficult to overstate just how positive this update is. progressive itemization is a huge factor in closing the gap between original vanilla PvE difficulty and classic difficulty and at the same time it's far from the stereotypical blizzard lowest-common-denominator solution. I think it might be time to start investing in confetti again!
---
As long as they change BRE I don't need anything else, but lets be fucking real BRE in 1.12 state is retarded and shouldn't be in the game at launch. 
---
I never lost any of mine. I have several toons with pvp titles. I don’t think you’re wrong, I know it’s wrong; unless you glitched them out somehow. Besides it’s just a down vote. Relax. 
---
Interesting. I wonder if it was changed on retail at some point or if I'm misremembering.
---
Nice to see the zul'gurub issues present in their first timeline solved.
---
you sure you not actually trolling?
---
How can you call TBC nostalgia but say classic is different? Who the fuck are you to decide what is nostalgia and what is legit good gameplay?
---
I recognize this links to Wowhead instead of the official post, so it's not *technically* a repost, but to try and keep discussion consolidated, I'm locking this post. Please use the [first post over here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azv3g6/classic_content_plan/)
---
Hahahahaha, this is the first thing I thought about!
---
Would you honestly prefer 1000 people in elwynn fighting over 20 wolves on 5 minute respawn timers?
---
They are actually listening that’s the best news 
---
&gt; We haven’t yet determined exactly when phases 2-6 will occur...
---
So they ***do*** know when Phase 1, ie Launch will occur.  Launch date reveal imminent.
---
Don't @ me over this one, I'm getting psyched and none of you can stop me.
---
Honestly I'm hoping the vanilla mindset comes back in terms of buffing other players. I remember leveling a priest and basically spent half the time in leveling zones throwing buffs around. I wasn't the only one either! Having a tougher leveling experience in vanilla kind of promoted a bit of selflessness because you realized how easy it was to die while questing. So if you wanted a buff from someone, give them a buff first!
---
Incoming: Fourteen 30 min videos about this from Tips &lt;3
---
Yeah same.
---
Where was that taken from?
---
The entire reason I even left my first comment is because in wrath or cata I transferred my toon and lost my title until I returned to my original server later that expansion, I don't give a shit what you think is right or wrong, it happened. 
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. 
---
It's the [4.2 Trailer, at 1:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsXglDs81FU&amp;t=1m30s)
---
Definitely says "shaymin"
---
It means you can get relevant pieces of gear for raiding as early as level 40 something. It means you'll actually get to enjoy and progress significantly through more content instead.
---
I’m saying that people often use the reasoning as to like king vanilla “nostalgia”. That is not the case, vanilla wow is a good product, and nostalgia is not the reason why it’s good.
---
TBC is not good, it’s terrible and the beginning of the downfall of WoW, and the reason people like TBC is because of nostalgia.
---
I'm going to play this game just so I can corpse-camp the crap out of you guys. See you in STV!
---
Me as well, as long as it's not too quick (like, one guild has MC on farm? time for the next phase). I would set the Vanilla timeline (about 24 months, 4 months per phase) as the target and adjust accordingly, ideally only pushing content backwards if a large portion of the community is still progressing.
---
This is awesome! I am glad Blizzard listened to the playerbase in this case :) I think, like many of us, that this is much preferred to the previous more concentrated release schedule. Interesting to see where PvP lands (and perhaps separate BG’s schedules).
---
As someone noted, /u/Ythisens did foreshadow this was coming ;).
---
Ahh, seems like a pretty obscure and specific thing to type in all caps about
---

This is what I am hoping for.  Pre-BG WPvP was a real special era in the game for me.  Had a blast with it.
---
WoooohooO!!!
---
The impact for a priest is immense. The revamped loot tables, especially in BRD, absolutely dominate pre-BiS lists. depending on how far they go with this, you could end up with a totally different list of items to go after.
---
in terms of your "ability" to play shadow it should be unaffected - your overall effectiveness will be lower due to a smaller amount of available spellpower gear, but imo it's not enough of a downgrade to warrant disqualifying the spec from PvE on its own.
---
Now if they got rid of sharding and loot trading this would be the perfect game.
---
6 phases Pog
---
The answer is always Eng. If you plan to tank ever, blacksmithing for your 2nd prof
---
Beta next week, mark my words.
---
I have at least one Vanilla nostalgic friend to talk about Classic with.  So that's nice.
---
I like it. I like it a lot.
---
They're listening :')
---
This is pretty huge
---
Means the lock dreadsteed quest won't exist until a later date probably.
---
Looks perfect. 
---
I'm positively surprised about the Titanic leggings details and other loot. 
---
The only thing I complain about now, is that I can't upvote this twice. An outregou! 
---
That's just what you want to read. If they had a set in stone release date they would announce it.
---
Yes!!!  That's how my perception of Vanilla is because I only played Vanilla private servers for years and years and EVERYTHING SHOULD BE EXACTLY LIKE THEM BECAUSE IF THEY AREN'T I WON'T BE COMFORTABLE
---
There's going to be a lot of time to dwell in the world before raiding really kicks into gear. This is good: one of the understated wonders of Vanilla was creating our own fun when there wasn't much to do. While I'd never call WoW a sandbox MMO,  Vanilla definitely had sandbox elements just through the size of the world and the myriad activities available. 
---
yes
---
same let's rub them together no homo
---
That might have been one of the reasons Joanna chose Darkshore but it wasn't the point I was responding to. I was responding to the indication that darkshore is a much better place to level due to pacing/quests, not the lack of competition.
---
Aside from that, it's a good point you made.
---
Not what I said. I said it's bad for Shadow Priests in PvE, which is the topic. You're the one changing the topic.
---
Looks good, do you have a version for a desktop background?
---
That's why WoW is such an important member of the MMO genre! Blizzard managed to create a game compelling enough that your dreaming about class/race combinations before even starting. It was actually an RPG! It gave the sense that you had control over your own gameplay/story and allowed players to create their own fantasy. Truly unique!
---
omfg Pog
---
What happens after phase 6?
---
Like do we go into BC?
---
Yes 
---
YESSSSSS DM NOT ON LAUNCH!!!!
---
They're listening!! They're listening!!!!!!
---
Just think for a good 5 minutes at how poorly that will go over.
---
You printed this out?
---
Yup, the level 58 vs level 60 sets.
---
Orc feels best, I’ve done warrior on a few races, not all the way into end game mostly leveling. IMO orc best for horde, dwarf for alliance. Mainly due to class fantasy reasons though orc has the racials to back it up. And yes their shoulder pads are redonkulous.
---
Fuck. I really don't want to have to stick to my slow-ass mount for a couple months, and don't want to have to spend 1,800g to get epic early, then pay extra for the class quest.
---
Looks like I'll never get my 100% pally mount then.
---
I'm hoping for an early bg release, 2 weeks after stage 2.
---
And not the 1.12 AV version.
---
I need a 45 minute video explaining to me this means, stat!
---
This is an easy one. These professions are the opposite of each other. Everything alchemists make can be used by others. (Almost) everything that engineers make can only be used by engineers. 
---
Take Alchemy if you want to make gold. Take engineering to enhance your playstyle.
---
Amazing.
---
Yeah, it was pretty common for me to forget log-in credentials at age 10. :p
---
# I SO EXCITE
---
My only critique would be to move tier 0.5 up to give non-raiders something to do
---
I wonder what they will do when phase 6 is out. Start new servers, do it again, ad infinitum? 1.13 content? TBC?
---
tldw: Blizz listened, they are focusing on power curve progression being as close to vanilla as possible.
---
Like comment subscriiiiiibe.
---
*Very* poorly. It can be solved with dynamic respawns, though. Which IIRC was a thing in Vanilla.
---
Did ZG really come out after MC, Ony and BWL? I hit 60 two months before BC and the day I hit 60 the guild I was in dragged me into ZG I literally had no idea what I was doing and probably did less damage than the tanks, I don't even remember if we killed a boss 
---
What type of assholes do you like because the horde have pvp assholes and the alliance have pve assholes due to the min/max elitism. In no way am i saying that if you min/max your an asshole. im just saying alot of assholes are min/maxers lol. ps i like to min/max on certain stuff
---
Phase 7: The Dark Portal Opens. 
---
It's probably because I only got into raiding in 2006, so virtually all of the content was already out, but it seems like with this progression plan, there will be an extended time for guilds to do 20-man raids, with ZG feeding directly in AQ20. Is that the case or did guilds do AQ40 at the same time as AQ20? Or perhps we should expect ZG while guilds are still clearing BWL.
---
I ask only because I would imagine it would make roster decisions complicated if you have to go a few months without 40-man raids.
---
It would be a madhouse. A big, beautiful madhouse.
---
Excellent! That means it'll be Phase 4 by the time I hit 60 and I'll actually get to participate in the AQ event!!
---
So would this mean that there's not going to be spellpower on any blue gear until AQ pretty much? Since this is when they overhaul the gear? The vanilla launch caster gear is dogshit and it would make me rethink rolling a mage if I have to wait until BWL to get gear that doesn't suck.
---
Haven't been keeping up recently, why do you specifically say "next week"? Or is that just a random date/guess because of the blue post today?
---
OC referenced troll priests being better. Another commenter said most pve players go troll for zerking and also referenced the ability for more damage as a shadow priest. I think you are the only one arguing solely about shadow spec viability w/ zerking, and I only stepped in because you said 20% spell haste does not affect a shadow priest, which just isn't true at all. Not a a big deal tho
---
Phase 7: The Dark Portal Opens
---
People, just consider the message they’re conveying with this update: THEY’RE LISTENING. 
---
Classic cynics in shambles
---
Are you rubbing your nipples against his nipples? Or are you both using your hands to rub his nipples?  Your post want really clear which option was in play
---
I have been playing a human warlock for years, didn't even realize we had a perception skill
---
Of course not, and it makes sense IMO.
---
yeah, r13 sets are problematic whether there is or isn't update. Either they're completely useless maybe apart from the hunter set or they're super strong until naxx patch.
---
wait, wasn't account creation done via [battle.net](https://battle.net) back then?
---
Oh, let's not.
---
Yes, blizzard probably decided on a, at least preliminary, launch date, but nothing in that post seems to indicate that.
---
Yea there are several Classic discords, the main one in this regard is the Classic recruitment Discord (which is currently not generating a proper link). I'll add it once I can figure out what's wrong.
---
So for people who say Hunters fall off DPS wise post BWL, does that mean hunter mains will enjoy some benefits of being powerful since AQ40 won't be released until Phase 5 or nearing the end of classic?
---
Cannot wait fella, see you there.
---
&gt; Just pvp left to figure out.
---
PvP gear isn't all that it's hyped up to be. It's not easy to get, and the blue stuff is BWL quality *at best*. The Grand Marshal stuff is basically impossible to obtain unless you're a complete no-lifer. Honestly releasing the blue stuff semi-early is NBD. I understand them wanting to hold off on Grand Marshal stuff though, that stuff is legit.
---
There has been some small thought because it will be the 15th anniversary of WoW Beta release, and 8.1.5 is also coming out that week. 
---
Well...it looks like they are listening. Which is something that private server players aren't going to like it. Blizzard listening to the fans?
---
This is GREAT NEWS tbh. A 6 phase content release? With Dire Maul in phase 2? HELL YEAH !
---
The fact they are listening means that they are trying to rebuild trust with the players. Not the BfA ones, because, well, there is no point. But if they stick to their guns with Classic, and they manage to rebuild the lost trust...well, that will put NEW content really on table, and not TBC, as people basically accept BECAUSE they don't trust Blizzard.
---
But if they rebuild their trust...and it seems that they scored a BIG one with this latest update...I am all for new content, and not repeating TBC.
---
that brings us closer to July 16
---
Dynamic respawns absolutely WEREN'T a thing in Vanilla. It was a mechanic introduced by private servers to address their problems.
---
Along with that, dynamic respawns wouldn't even come close to fully solving the problems that launch will bring.
---
reported to your mom, then
---
Holy shit, yes! Thank you Blizz!
---
Removed per rule 7. 
---
This happened to me too! Except I was the paladin. 
---
I took my beatings...
---
Boo no pally mount for months :(
---
1800g? wut
---
900g mate, I think 800g with pvp rank discount, correct me if im wrong
---
that is what they already did though iirc
---
With luck this also means they will have real progressive itemization and that example covers the dungeon drops as well. It would be much better to not have better than MC quality gear dropping for you before you bother doing MC.
---
Engineering is more important than Alchemy in your case as you don't need to be an Alch for any of the benefits you'll want. Without an alt though, you'll probably need mining to support Eng, unless you have another plan to make money.
---
you sir are a true gentleman. Thanks
---
No. It will be through the bnet launcher. 
---
Umplified.
---
Fantastic news! They are actually listening to the community! Here's hoping they listen to us about sharding and loot trading as well! Things are looking good bois, #summer2019 hype!
---
nobody knows, probably not even blizzard at this point.
---
I spent hours making a "DM:E for leveling and profit!" thing just last week :P
---
I think they will be beard necked.
---
What is happening, I love Blizzard
---
It throws pre-raid BiS lists in the trash can for certain classes.  I was one of the people looking to raid DM heavily.  I can't complain, as I remember the DM release coming well after release.  Just have to redo my list, which isn't fun
---
Maybe, I think I might be a clean shaven gent 
---
That would be awesome. 
---
Thanks 
---
This is seriously (!!!!) awesome. So no runaway pre-made guilds that clear Naxx when you are Level 45. 
---
With a Warlock toon in mind: this also implies the 8 debuff limit at the beginning?
---
I pulled up this sub  to show a coworker that was iffy on the subject of playing wow. And of course this is the first meme we see. Too perfect. Way too perfect. 
---
I know but just imagine we get it again &lt;3
---
I'm not sure, LOL! My mum helped me make my account at the time. 
---
Based on the url at the bottom of the page it says: https://sign up.worldofwarcraft.com/completed.html
---
I never had a bnet client or anything on my computer from what I can remember, just a WoW icon.
---
I'll need to spend 900g for epic mount.
---
Then if I want my paladin mount, I'll need to spend 900 more.
---
Historically, if they follow the same progression patter, when do Argent Dawn rewards factor into this?
---
One of my favorite things Nost got wrong. Kobolds in the cave in the human starting zone are supposed to be agro!
---
For me the biggest part is that they really earned a lot of trust from me. This sounds like they are very well versed in what vanilla was about and what is nesessary to actually #change. I'm actually hyped 110%.
---
ARE YOU READY
---
It's the idea of being in control of your own destiny. If you go engineering without mining, your profession is usless unless you buy ore on the AH, so you'll need to have some form of a money-maker. If you take mining, you have an automatic money-maker and something to feed engineering.
---
Granted, he's a lock, so he should have options, but if you're a tank or healer, a gathering profession is incredibly helpful.
---
Very promising news. I hope they implement the PvP gear update so that at the appropriate phase player's existing gear gets updated to the new stats. Other than the easily identifiable exception of PvP gear it's probably best to keep it simple by not changing gear stats even if it does make players slightly more powerful.
---
LET'S GO!
---
I WAS READY 5 YEARS AGO
---
Same.  It isn't soul crushing, but I had a pretty extensive list involving DM, I had been running DM in blues on private servers to practice.  It is more like your boss coming in and saying that thing you worked hard on isn't a thing anymore.
---
YESSSSSSSSSS
---
WE ARE PREPARED
---
No, it means phase one will happen at launch and they haven't determined how long after luanch the other phases will be.
---
why is 1.12 bonereaver particularly broken?
---
I didn't really think about that but yeah it makes sense that they were likely monitoring the community in Vanilla and determining when to release patches.
---
So you role played a rogue and stole it?
---
thank you very much 
---
As it was in Vanilla.
---
PogChamp! great news
---
I'm very interested to know this as well. 
---
This is actually very true, sadly. 
---
I wonder how this will work with things like quest hubs that were introduced later.. like all the eastern plaguelands stuff (and enchants), and thorium brotherhood.. 
---
Exactly. It is content, and should be treated the same way. Locks get a free level 40 mount, they can either wait for the epic quest (Which costs nearly as much to do the quest as buy one) or just buy a regular mount from their race.
---
Wasnt it just trained at your class trainer?
---
What's the reasoning for releasing Tier 0.5 in Phase 5? Seems late compared to the other content/raids, or was it that way in Vanilla as well? So long ago I can't remember
---
Now that DM won't be out on launch suppose these are gonna change a hell of a lot 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE no changes
---
They're coming, at least 6 times over.
---
&gt;I never had a bnet client or anything on my computer from what I can remember, just a WoW icon.
---
that was normal until the client has released. Though, your account still was a [battle.net](https://battle.net) account.
---
But, I think they introduced that later, on patch 3.2
---
So about the speed at which these phases come out. I think it would be ideal to hold official polls to determine the progression of the community. Questions such as “have you completed MC/Onyxia yet”? And once a high enough percentage have passed that progression, it is then you begin to launch further phases. 
---
Some guilds will be substantially faster than others. Would not like to see the progression too fast.
---
All aboard the July 16 gnome train! Why? Cause please Blizzard, please. 
---
pally quest wont cost you 900g. by the time dire maul gets released you should easily been able to get those mats for decent prices
---
still, obviously if you want BOTH epic mounts, yeah it SHOULD cost you an arm and a leg
---
IT'S ACTUALLY SAVED BOYS
---
progressive itemization is items changing/being upgraded. like wands getting better. this is time-gating items.
---
this is actually absolutely ridiculously freaking insane guys 
---
So Warlocks just don't get 100% ground speed during Phase one? Is that how it was originally too?
---

---
BLIZZARD IS BACK BABY
---
No one knows. Blizzard probably has a rough draft, but I'd assume they're going to see how the first 6 phases turn out and go from there. Hopefully it's better than expected! 
---
I mean, I wouldn't care waiting for a mount over paying for one.
---
BLIZZARD IS ON OUR SIDE
---
&gt;My mum helped me make my account at the time.
---
hmm, instead of saying "no, because you'll play it"?
---
no way
---
For 2 minutes it would be funny. For the following 48 hours you'll have crashing servers, reddit and forums exploding, waves of refund requests, GM ticket spam, etc. 
---
If you really give a shit about Vanilla, you want the launch to go as smooth as possible. Otherwise you'll see like 90%+ quit within a week.
---
I think they mean the tier .5 revamp rather than tier .5 itself (could be wrong though). I think it was all upgraded later in the game or they added quests to significantly upgrade the items
---
At the classic panel at blizzcon they said it would be 16 debuffs.  Although they also said it was a 4 phase content schedule so i guess it could change, but they didn't specifically say so I'd imagine it's 16.
---
Brilliant news! Lets hope the comms between us and them continues to ramp up!
---
A LOT ! In the good sense.
---
MC and Ony will actually be much more challenging, the BiS items changes with each patch, the gameplay will be much more suited for groups and community.
---
It's great news ! Just be happy:)
---
Yesssss, war effort confirmed!
---
I think we start gathering the memes for server lag, and crash. 
---
Nice :)
---
I wish but I don't think so :(
---
proud of you boi we did it
---
&gt; Imagine the ticket volume for item restoration requests after stat change patches.
---
Blizzard has an automated system for this now though.
---
That's some great news:)
---
PogU
---
they listened to you PogYou
---
ANY POGGERS?
---
I played Warcraft back when it was released (it was a birthday gift I didn't want, but soon fell in love with).  My God, so much of the stuff carried over.  What an amazing job they did
---
I'm definitely happy about the update just trying to wrap my head around it all.
---
I was here.
---
Very cool but IMO un'goro is way too big and is encroaching on Tanaris too much.
---
Overall this is a great idea!
---
Being vocal paid off ! Good job guys 
---
This is what I use.  If you follow this guide, and kill monsters as you move from quest to quest (grind along the way), that is the optimal way to level.
---
Things are looking up.
---
I remember I killed 2 people doing this quest once, right at the end. I didn't know what it was till later when the chicken dropped for me, fuck I felt so bad. 
---
Ooooh boy am I hyped right now
---
ret paladins do no damage
---
It depends on how automated their data conversion is.  I'm going to assume most of the content for Classic is going to be there in snapshots.  They don't want to waste time hand-authoring anything; the content for example will likely literally just be a bool they set when they're ready to launch DM.  
---
I don't want to say it WILL happen, but I wouldn't put it off the table completely.
---
"I felt a great disturbance in the preperations, as if millions of gold grinders and auction house heroes suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.
---
I'm going to watch them because it's a lot harder to make content than to sit on your ass and pick apart someone else's
---
Of course, they also said this: **"but we’ve decided to hold off on Dire Maul for a while"** FOR A WHILE. 
---
We will get the first stage while they can plan and release content as they like, no timestamp needed. When players are fully ready for the next stage, they will launch it. This is just perfect news for us players.
---
And yes, they 100% have a release date ready to go considering they are already planning the 2-6 stages. This honestly makes me think the release date might be earlier than we think.
---
God I'm so glad they didn't listen to the people asking for DM at launch. Makes me hopeful that they have people on their team that actually know what their doing. 
---
Weapon specialization racials are huge in PvE though.
---
My guild's first couple 4hm kills had us down in Zeliek at like mark 120. That fight really was pretty ridiculous on original Feenix Warsong (and post coremerge as well).
---
So now I'm wondering, When exactly did HOJ move to Emp from Angerforge? are we going to see it moved back to Angerforge?
---
The biggest question I have with this is, if they are following the Classic patch progression... eventually they will hit the point in time when Burning Crusade dropped. What happens then? It won't be *Classic* if they just begin mimicking the old expansion progression.
---
life hack if you flick ur nipples they instantly get hard
---
Fuuuucccckkk yeeeaaaahhhh
---
You know what's funny, I plan on taking zero of these raids into my consideration of getting the game. I simply just want to be part of a roving band of open world pvp sacking settlements. I'll candy my ass through raids for gear but raids are on the meh scale for me
---
Yes it was added in a later patch.
---
When did they add that? I haven’t played retail in quite some time, but glad to hear they finally implemented an easier way. 
---
do you knnow the shortcut from darkshore to felwood or felwood to winterspring? can you share?&gt;
---
This is such great news! Blizz listened! &lt;3 &lt;3 
---
Loot trading can go (or be restricted to raids) but temp sharding at launch needs to stay.
---
OMG this is so amazing.
---
There is SO MUCH more that will affect progression in Classic. Like flasks...only very few people will actually use them...because nobody will sell them outside their guild.
---
Also, due to smaller population &gt; less guilds killing Ony &gt; less Ony buffs available.
---
And so on...
---
A LOT of people will be SHOCKED at how hard Vanilla actually was (hard is hard, regardless of WHAT exactly makes it hard). And by a lot, I mean like 90% of the Classic player base.
---
The ONLY ones that won't be shocked will be old Vanilla players...and they are a minority within a minority.
---
Woah! What's the hurry? The game isn't going anywhere!
---
The messy hair makes me believe he was sleeping but his neckbeard sense tingled and he knew... he knew there's classic news.
---
You can tell how horny he is by how much he keeps pinching those air nipples while he talks!
---
&gt; Loot Trading and right-click report are next
---
Let's be honest... right-click report is the worst because it is so easily abused. Loot Trading has actual positives to go with the downsides.
---
so idc so much about Loot Trading but right-click report is just asking for problems.
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
Therefore, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or simply apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/ 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
*P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al-HuOkpVhA*
---
July 15th XD
---
They for sure have an internal date that they're working towards. If they think its 100% achievable they will let us know. 
---
You have to be 60, and farm all that gold.
---
It's not gonna be as easy as on a pserver to farm those gold...
---
How many days you think you can farm your gold and 60 ?
---
blozzard pls we need anwsers
---
That would be nice, in hindsight, but unfortunately violates #NoChanges principle. 
---
If you want to PvP, undead is the best race, no question. 
---
Wrath baby :(
---
They probably want to see the population on beta and at launch. See the hype and money generated with vanilla.
---
Robe of the void is really good for both pve and pvp and requires tailoring to get as a warlock. You could theoretically level up tailoring to 300 to make the robes and then drop tailoring for other professions. There's also the bloodvine set (from the ZG patch) that's good for all dps casters in pve and requires you to be a tailor for the set bonus (though you can wear it without being a tailor).
---
https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=421
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=14153
---
How would it make roster decisions complicated? Most guilds will still be farming BWL when ZG comes out and since ZG is a 20 man raid if guilds are done with BWL they'll just split their 40 man raid into 2 20 man raids to farm ZG until AQ releases.
---
Less talking, more rubbing.
---
No idea honestly, I took a long break from retail.
---
You can always just buy the racial mounts.
---
If you go back to the blizzcon videos though, they said they only were able to recover data for 1.12. It wasn't totally clear though, so maybe they do have some prior data, but at least that's what it seemed like they were saying.
---
Stop lying. That icon has nothing to do with vanilla ranks and everything to do with lifetime HKs. A level 19 has that crown and they obviously didn’t get R14 or 15 during Vanilla because of level restrictions on ranks. 
---
R15 was never implemented in the first place as well. /r/quityourbullshit
---
Still have Gnomish deathray on my Mage despite dropping Engineering back in Vanilla. Was actually kind of useful during BC leveling!
---
I mean, yes, there's a chance, but it's so small it's basically non-existant.
---
loot trading is problematic primarily for dungeons, if it was raid only it wouldn't be a problem and the community is split with sharding. The thing with sharding is that it's going to be very temporary so if even those people that don't like won't have to deal with it for more than a few hours anyways.
---
Okay I think we're burying the lead here..LOOT REVAMP CONFIRMED.

This has been one of the major sticking points with them saying that they would strictly be pulling from the 1.12 database. Many of the loot revamp items (looking at you Turban) really screw with raid progression, and while I hope they will continue to look at this further and maybe even tune those items down, knowing that we'll at least have the actual progression without this items is place is a huge leap forward. Thank you Blizzard for listening.
---
Entirely depends how popular/how much money they make from Classic.
---
That would be too obliging for me, to be perfectly honest with you. There are things happening in my life, that make me being unable to say when, how often and how long I'm going to be playing. One thing I need to say, You made me smile - and that was something. Thank you.
---
Who knows, maybe see you out there!
---
I'm honestly not super surprised. My thinking on it: Blizzard has a chance to claw back a huge player base that isn't thrilled with the current game. It's in their own financial interest to listen to that player base and produce a faithful recreation. We've seen that there are certain technical limitations to creating a perfect copy of Vanilla, understandable, but outside of that if they're not doing their best to create the game people want they're wasting their own time and money.
---
Regarding PvP, I think just sticking to their two patch progression plan is a good fit. So the PvP system (1.4) would launch with Phase 2 but Battlegrounds (1.5) wouldn't launch until Phase 3. That gives us a phase with a cool middle-ground where people have an incentive to get out in the world and attack each other.
---
*Ravenholdt rep farming intensifies*
---
Nothing is impossible, but I would taper your expectations as if they did progress through those, it would more than likely be a few years. Just enjoy Vanilla for now.
---
CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS
---
is that Windows Vista?
---
Fuck yes!
---
I should say, that the same principle applies to pretty much everything in life. Wise words, indeed. Cheers!
---
most paladins and warlocks buy a normal epic mount anyway since their class mount is a spell which interrupts mana regen
---
2012
---
awwww shiiii...
---
That's it. Something, that we've forgotten about RPGs: the sense of ADVENTURE. Starting from being a noob and enjoying the heck out of it's charm. See the first two Gothics (even if at the beginning of Gothic II if you know you have been a powerful being before), Baldur's Gate I or even Fallout I/II.
---
Leveling a hunter, I refused to Hunter's Mark anything because it "was dumb" and spammed abilities on every mob. Got frustrated and quit the hunter because I never had any mana. Also repeatedly needed swords because they were a higher level than my current even though they were worse on stats. 
---
No sharding at launch would be a big big mistake, too many people with shitty PC, unless bliz finds a magical way to do it without getting people with bad PC to explode then yeah maybe.
---
A temporary sharding should be the plan then slowly remove it as the playerbase flows.
---
You should buy an epic mount anyways if you can afford it. It's better than wasting Mana casting the mount you get from quest. 
---
Most likely this. 
---
/e throws a flare on the ground.
---
Are people only getting classic to experience old raids? 
---
Inc 500 more posts about the damaging effects of early sharding, loot trading, and right click reporting...
---
If everyone did the most efficient thing the most efficient thing would change. Someone has to farm those herbs for people to buy.
---
less complaining posts*
---
Just roll male Orc. You look so ridiculous on a dreadsteed you'll want to go buy the wolf anyways.
---
Big news just happened with itemization due to DM being delayed at launch and there being 6 patches instead of 4. A BIS that is accurate might not be available at this time. We will definately know before launch. Other than that you want a autoshot timer and you don't clip the autoshot or you lose a lot of damage. There should be lots of "vanilla dps hunter rotation" vids on youtube.
---
Very good news, congrats! :-D
---
There is nothing in LW that you'd make money on, except if you were making devilsaur sets for your farming friends. 
---
Agree'd this is a great first step, but should also be something to watch as the release comes closer.  There are tons of items that are in the game at the start that get super boosted in later patches.

Well you dont actually need to /camp for dm:n farm with mage. You clear the dogs and the boss near entrance and walk out on foot.
---
That's just how it went in my experience too, I was looking forward to each change that wrecked things. My only problem with that is how competent Vanilla was, that they always looked at the experience of the players playing the game first, and then out of nowhere the company switched to "let's just give them what they're asking for." So IMHO it doesn't add up.
---
Hhhnnnggg
---
Here is how that weapon changed throughout the vanilla patch cycle.
---

---
Could be Windows 7, right? 
---
Its a pretty substantial amount of threat if you can buff everyone in your party with it (60 * number of people buffed * def stance multiplier / number of mobs in combat). The real issue is whether it continues to generate threat when you are just refreshing it rather than applying it. Some private servers give threat on the refresh and some do not, not sure which is correct. But if it does you can easily hold 3-4 mobs just autoing skull and spamming shout in leveling dungeons.
---
I started playing durung Cata, Im so excited about this. 
---
NO DM AT LAUNCH THEY LISTENED!!!!!!
---
HOLY SHIT!!!
---
Was really critical of having Dire Maul out at launch, this and others are really good changes!
---
Good. If you can't even wait 10 hours to finish the first quest, you're not hardcore enough and you don't deserve to play Classic. ^/s
---
Phase 7 Cont: Players walk through the portal only to discover that the iron horde is prepping for its invasion on classic WoW because the portal was accidentally set to invade classic Azeroth in a timeline alternate to the original alternate Draenor. It’s up to us heroes to man our garrisons and save classic Azeroth once again!
---
*fewer
---
Spent 2 hours last night reading this sub and watching YouTube videos with speculation only for this to drop today. Sometimes coincidences are so uncanny. With that said... Hype level is over 9000!
---
Warlocks started off needing the generic race based  lvl 60 mounts. Paladin and Warlock class specific mounts were added later.
---
Pssh, you can't stop my cynicism. Well, not until they also phase class design mechanics. 
---
If everyone farmed gold instead of doing herbalism then herbalism would become the best money maker. So yeah 
---
IIRC Blizzard's stance on it right now is that they do not have any plans for Classic TBC and beyond right now but they're open to the idea and will see how the community feels about it when the time is right. Sorry, can't remember exactly where this came from but it may have been BlizzCon.
---
This really is the only logical answer. Classic is the focus right now but if it's a success and the community is interested in Classic TBC I don't see why they wouldn't go for it. WoW can't last forever but Classic releases are a way of increasing the lifespan of their IP.
---
That's the question I have coming out of this.
---
This patch cycle sounds amazing, but what is the plan after patch 6? Does the world just stagnate? New servers? New vanilla content? BC?
---
That's funny but there's reason to whine him and his friends feel the need to voice our concerns.
---
&gt; With a Warlock toon in mind: this also implies the 8 debuff limit at the beginning?
---
Nope. They're gating _content_, but _mechanics_ will be 1.12 from the start.
---
This is assuming there even IS a beta.
---
Not sure if you are confused or i am, but 8.1.5 is coming out Tomorrow.
---
And of course the classes themselves in terms of talents. For instance the mage talent that gives them 6% hit wasn't introduced until the Naxx patch. Which means they gain 6% hit from talents long before the hit stat is even in the game. That I would like to see changed.
---
Well this didn’t age well. We just got additional content patches to further match the original release.
---
I couldn't care less about the mana. Mount is used to get from point A to point B faster. The 150 mana cost will be refunded in like 9 seconds.
---
I don't love Blizzard. Any respect here goes to the Classic team. Blizzard only gets credit for green-lighting the project.
---
They said CMs and devs browse these sites so if one reads this thank you so much we were all concerned with the original 4 phase plan and as you can see this is getting a massive positive reaction from classic fans.
---
Great news, sucks for locks and paladins though =P
---
Pally quest added up to like 5-600.
---
Agreed. If you seriously think that one side's playerbase is different than the other in any noticeable way, you are delusional. Both sides have PvP tryhards, both sides have toxic assholes, both sides have good raiders, both sides have children, both sides have adults.
---
Go to sleep :D
---
This Dwarf really loves WoW
---
The original release plan was how I was justifying to myself that I wasn't going to give this game any more money. Now I'm thinking I might have to actually play Classic
---
Have you heard the call?
---
I would be so ecstatic if they did the same treatment for TBC. I can't wait to experience classic.. but I came on board at the start of TBC so that's where my true nostalgia rests. I'm sure vanilla is going to be fantastic though I just cannot wait.
---
Release date?? When?? 
---
nice one, thank god
---
Mfw I try this and it actually works :D
---
 **&lt;TBD&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild (working on a name, we are holding a March Madness style vote in Discord eventually), specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Possible raid Schedule:**
---
2 days a week (likely weeknights, possibly 1 weeknight and Sunday). The window for raids times would between 8PM EST and 1AM EST. This does not mean we would raid during this entire time, only that we have the possibility if members are willing to stay awake and push until 1AM EST.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
We will use some form of DKP or EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
&gt; Dungeon loot reconfiguration: Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes 
---
This is the only one thing I don't understand. How is that a big deal to put that in phase 2 instead of phase 5?
---
I plan on playing ret among other things, and since neither PvP nor T0.5 will be at the beginning apparently, I feel like it will be very tough for some class that actually benefit a lot from T0.5. I don't think it would break anything to have at least T0.5 earlier.
---
I think we may be misunderstanding each other. I definitely don't want them to hurry. I would be perfectly happy with a timeline longer than the original Vanilla timeline. But I don't think the wider community shares that view. IMO 24 months is a target that most people would be happy with. For me personally 36 months/6 months per phase would probably be my sweet spot.
---
Stun resistance not considered good anymore? Plus Damage boost
---
I like healing the most and plan on going shaman which are super heavy raid desired (I like the class too). However I am waiting for someone in our guild discord to apply for feral tank/OT. If no one does then I will head the call gladly
---
1.12 has a proc on hit that gives you 700 armor pen, it stacks 3 times giving you a total of 2100 armor pen buff.
---
Now ofc private server could proc it a lot more but still that's fucking crazy. Also it has +16 stam more.
---
The proc pre 1.10 is putting a 200 armor debuff on the target, which stacks on raid bosses and is pretty amazing for raiding, but BRE in pvp is just a complete game changer.
---
Ok great to hear! 
---
There better be right click report
---
The amount of obvious bots on a certain pserv is insufferable and you can’t do anything about it
---
Yup. So happy. This was pretty much my reaction.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_iOKiFhZt2E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iOKiFhZt2E)
---
Don't even tease us man. The hype is too real right now.
---
I believe we have confirmation they are using the 1.12 talent trees.  In my opinion, there are plus and minuses for having progressive class talent progression.  Some classes don't get a rework until extremely late in the game while others are optimized pretty early on.  I think the best route is just using the 1.12.1 talents from the very beginning.
---
Next week is a week after 8.1.5 for retail, and based on what Ythisens had said, they would likely stagger retail and classic content. A classic beta would 100% cannibalize players from the newest retail content.
---
There's an underwater basket weaving forum
---
I've found the orc racials to be better overall than troll. You can use bloodfury more often than berserking, it doesn't require you to be at low health to be at maximum effectiveness and doesn't require rage to use. The axe bonus seems more beneficial than beast slaying as well. The difference is marginal though. I'd rather player Tauren because they look the best imo.
---
Honestly don't think warlocks will be that scarce this time around. People are now more aware of their pvp power, and we get to start out in the post 1.8 world of compressed dot duration which was a huge improvement to the warlock leveling experience.
---
HYPE TRAIN BOUT TO LEAVE THE STATION
---
Esfand is such a great community manager.
---
Warrior weren't seen as good dps until late AQ40 because of mechanic changes that happened in 1.8 and 1.9 that made them good dps.
---
At which point means why not just have Classic progress through the same patch cycle as it did back then? While I ain't as big a fan of it either, the way they are doing it is a fine enough place to draw the line without going full into a rerelease.
---
CHROMIE!!!
---
Wow, better than I expected. now I just want to hear they are doing original AV
---
I'd prefer that yeah. I mean, I'm in no hurry; once Classic is out it isn't going anywhere. I can experience it at my leisure. Even if it means a week or two of zones blown out from over-questing, it'd be worth it. So so worth it.
---
I figured it was the 1-5 zone, I hope once you leave the 2nd zone there is no sharding at all. Hillsbrad be damned.
---
That still means I can:
---
- a) spend 4 months without an epic mount and spend 600g on class mount
---
- b) spend 900g on epic mount, then 600g more for class mount
---
- c) never get class mount.
---
Other players can get secondary mounts for 90g, yet paladins and warlocks need to pay 6x, or go months without an epic mount. Looks like I just won't be getting a pally mount.
---
Yea, but running two raids adds complications obviously. So this would mean you would need to do that for an extended time period if after ZG, you then need to go directly into AQ20.
---
As a hunter or lock doing maraudon farm and in the meanwhile mining nodes on the path gives a profit which adds up alot. Truesilver node + 2 mithril nodes in the instance on your path. And nodes outside the instance when walking back to the portal also mithril and truesilver. After one hour of farming I usually end up with around 30 mithril oree, stack of solid stone and truesilver. That's already an extra 10g on top of your blues you vendor. The best money maker if dm T/E farm is needed would be maraudon with mining and herbing. 
---
You are right. I think this is even more likely then. I haven't been keeping good track of Retail things, haha.
---
July 16
---
There is next to no new content in 8.1.5. Two allied races.
---
I think they will be completely separate, without regard for one or the other. Most people who are enjoying BFA will not be playing retail, and vice versa.

Honestly, both sides can make a great argument about this.   There's obviously nostalgia about having too many people in starting zones.  Alternatively, I don't think it was a good play experience nor was it done by design.
---
This is pretty neat, did you make it with Inkarnate?
---
You have a great mentality towards launch, but unfortunately the vocal majority won't be as patient.
---
As someone who just missed vanilla.. what's the benefit of this? Pardon my ignorance.
---
Have they said anything about how many realms there will be? 
---
These things tend to go badly as some asshole higher-up steps in to smear his feces on it. 
---
Instead, some awesome higher-up is protecting the project. That rarely happens. That means that some very powerful people at Blizzard are, at the least, protecting the project and possibly even guiding it responsibly. 
---
It's okay to give them credit. Something like this would never have happened without proper management. 
---
Unless they specify otherwise, I would expect to see 1.12 versions of gear when the game launches.
---
Its 8 yd
---
Looks more like a vending machine.
---
Why double mage?
---
This also gives people plenty of time to acquire the Mats for the AQ Gong quest, since we have an idea what is actually needed. 
---
That would be the optimal way indeed. This news is definitely positive, but I will fight teeth and nail to nerf those blasted mages until Naxxramas is released!
---
When they say "Scourge Invasion" is that the pre-BC patch or something else that I don't remember?

Finally?  It hasn't been too long.
---
Not true, they can basically destroy your life if you play one. THAT is damage.
---
Yup. Normalization and buffs to fury. Have put that in other posts. I am just stating that the best gear was funneled to rogues, just like mages because they were on top. 2 hand fury wasn't THAT bad on Horde before that cus of windfury but full dps warriors were still rare. A lot of guilds required warriors to have last stand back in the day. I'm still gonna use that 2 hand spec with Ashkandi though on my Orc. I'm not about that rank 14 life. :)
---
No no no no no no no no no no
---
But this is retail, the peasants have heirlooms.
---
That's what a mage would say, as if they need more advantages..
---
Easily. But warlocks help and it’s good to have a mix. 
---
Awesome!!!
---
Found Tips alt account.

You can pug to about r10 if you are super dedicated, 6-8 hrs a day nonstop pvp anything higher is nolife premading
---
&gt; There is nothing in LW that you'd make money on
---
there are some pieces of armor that are often more expensive to vendor, than to craft
---
Thanks. Planning to enjoy vanilla but I was curious if i could hope for it in the future.
---
Yeah this what I'm wondering, in short lol. Early caster gear just plain sucked.
---
This is actually quite amazing! I wouldnt mind just straight 1.12 with progression raids. This will make it a lot more fun though!
---
Mages are super OP in vanilla, I agree. 
---
Ok well, we'll see. It would be nice to be able to play affliction. 
---
I know there's already a post about this, but I just feel this picture is easier to understand.

---
Never played WoW except for like 2 weeks of legion, can someone explain to me why people were asking for phases? And what blizzards original plan for this was that made people angry
---
&gt; Which is something that private server players aren't going to like it. 
---
How did private server players get such a bad reputation here? 
---
ZG will bring BiS 3 slot gear for casters (till Naxx). This set will give a huge increase for raids DPS. + enchants. There are also a big list with a gear which will be easy to obtain and make BWL much more easy.
---
oh damn, 3 points in the lowest tier, and more than 5 in the tier above.
---
Seriously, anti-hybrid?
---
I think this is kinda bad, tbh. It assumes a hell of a lot, and the data is way off in places; 1-6 takes half the time on average, sub-7 hours 59-60 is quite a feat. 
---
Honestly, there's so many factors at play, it's impossible to calculate. What class are you playing? How experience / efficient are you? Do you want to do anything other than level? 
---
didn't early on this cost you a candle?
---
The head/leg enchants and some of the gear makes BWL easier. It was released later originally, so they are trying to be closer to the original version with a similar experience.
---
lets gooooo bois! Make Azeroth great again!
---
DM will probably be out by the time I reach 60 haha. 
---
unsubscribe
---
I'm betting it is all going to be determined if it actually needs it or not. People might level much slower than anticipated and the zones will start thinning out around level 10, or the opposite and people are progressing together, and it will be needed through 15-20. But again, this is all conjecture.  
---
Does reputation get you anything other than mounts?
---
Warriors will always be bottle necked in classic.  What is odd for me is that the only class I played in vanilla was warrior as prot.  I did the 60 grind as prot lol.  So when people talk about how hard it is I feel like you are over exaggerating.  However I know that many people just don't pick up things quick enough.
---
I agree almost completely. The only thing I believe is objectively different will be horde side pve tanks. Trolls have shown to be the top TPS tank on horde side. Threat is the most important thing to a tank on vanilla. Trolls da best mon.
---
Excellent post. Still no mention about permanent issues that will affect the game years after its released, such as loot trading and spell batching.
---
TBC is downfall of WoW? Really? Subs were sky-rocketting. I hope they will do a TBC Classic. I have  not so much intentions to play Classic. I love more TBC and those are not rose glasses.

Hope yes. TBC forever...

It was the event leading up the opening of Naxx.   Scourge were all over azeroth it was fun.
---
I think you will kill classic you if you leave players with only MC and Only and the world dragons for a whole year. 
---
Leveling takes time, but not that long.
---
Phase 1: July 16
---
Phases 2-6: TBD
---
honestly about 50% of the reason im still alive
---
Yeah, probably less of an issue with classic since the release dates are unknown and they are probably going to spread this content over 2 years or more. I have seen people on private servers spending time grabbing items that are garbage just because they know that a month down the road the patch that makes them good will hit and they can sit in a bank until then. The big thing with this is likely going to be hoarding things that turn into rep or items until the patch hits (Stuff for cenarion turn ins, or argent dawn turn ins).
---
Nope.
---
As someone new to classic was DM broken gear wise? Like did it make the first few raids obsolete?
---
Yes, tbc was the downfall of Wow.
---
- death of world pvp
---
- flying mounts
---
- resilience
---
- splitting the population between outlands and Azeroth
---
- rampant realm transfers/ name changes, destroying server communities
---
etc
---
My ideal progression is add arenas and new raids/dungeons (either all new ones or re-purpose ones that were added in later expansions). Leave the level cap at 60, don't add Outlands, never consider adding in flying, provide new raid sets that buff underused specs.
---
I'm just one guy but I'll just indicate that no. I want Classic servers and I want TBC servers (and WoTLK servers). All separate, all unchanging.
---
Is dire maul a raid in Classic?? I looked it up but it shows it’s a normal dungeon?
---
I’m trying to figure out why it’s always talked about and why it’ll be released after MC. I wasn’t aware this was a raid if that’s the case. Thanks
---
endorphins are great lil guys
---
Good stuff Blizzard, finally something you guys said that made me happy.
---
It's nice to see they're actually working hard on this. I'm so fucking hyped.
---
Why are you rejecting new content and prefer TBC and WOTLK?
---
I just want to know how talents will be handled. I need to know if Druids are going to be pre or post Dire Bear form armor buffs or not. If they will be pre buff for too long I may re think rolling Druid
---
Best news since sliced bread.  I'm excited to see how it all goes down... again.  Still undecided at my level of involvement.
---
So what we can take away from this is ...
---
In the first stage of content, (3-6 months) No relics, No DM and no world dragons / bosses.
---
Stage 2, DM is available with the non-emerald dragon world bosses. **HOT TAKE** PvP gear and ranking may be available here!
---
Stage 3, Notably DMF is available here! I was unsure when this would be made available.  Probably 6-9 months after initial launch.  I personally would like to see Dungeon Set 2 bumped up here along with relics, but that is just *like* my opinion, *man*.
---
The rest is self explanatory.
---
HOKIES!
---
Minor disadvantage that it's a 2-hander which is not that great in the hands of a fury. Added to this is that BRE will probably go to a serious PvPer and he will be specced Arms and do almost no dps in raids. 
---
Got it 👍. So it keeps BWL at it's intended difficult before releasing ZG which will then make BWL significantly easier.
---
I came in at TBC and that kind of reminds me of how ZA worked. It made getting into Tier 5 raids easy mode.
---
Thank you
---
That said, here's some King Gizz;

---
Why do you reject new content and prefer vanilla?
---
\*Upgrade\*
---
\*Fuck go back\*
---
Very pleasantly surprised, even if I dont agree with all of it, seems like they are reading feedback.
---
While I dont really see DM as a vital stage, Im glad they added in Azuregos and Kazzak to make it feel like a more major patch
---
I absolutely thought it necessary to have a ZG patch as a catchup in between BWL and AQ40, very happy with that change.
---
Happy with the idea of pre-1.10 drops, it shows theyre willing to put more work in to improve the content, its something I thought they would just ignore completely because it was too much hassle. It is however one of those annoyances where no one is really going to know exactly whats been changed and what hasnt.
---
Nice. Thanks for the explanation and as someone who came in at TBC I am in total agreement with that decision. ZA in TBC made Tier 5 easy mode when it was introduced way later on.. which was fine because at that point T5 had been out forever.
---
DEFINITELY same. I (and hopefully most others) have a completely different life compared to when I used to play wow, and can't invest even half the time I used to. I would absolutely prefer if they took their foot off the pedal on the progression stuff, let those of us playing on mostly weekends catch up.
---
i play tauren and what you said is mostly nothing new to me, the only things new to me is you saying that you think i somehow said tauren is bad? wtf was that about?
---
ankh only being good for ONE thing is just simply wrong. as i said before you seem to not be playing.
---
Your noob-build still runs 3/5 totemic, as does the build with improved rankh.
---
Really annoying when a person acts so smug and so arrogant, write a lot of text and noobs reading it think he has a point.
---
If you need ankh for 1v1 you are basically not good enough or you are massivley outgeared, like playing vs a  6.5k hp unbuffed warrior who gets 3 dark edge of insanity procs. 
---
It's so annoying when a smug noob who cant admit a point has the last word.
---
It's so weird that the Classic community loves Blizz now, but retail hates them lol
---
Wait wait. You level to to sixty as prot?! Are you a masochist 😂?
---
It'll probably be easier actually because the private servers nerf popular grinding spots like DM, ZG and BRD. 
---
This is the same crowd that said the release date for Classic would be November 23rd, 2019 - the 15th anniversary.
---
They were shouted down by the crowd who said "Didn't you hear John Staats? There's no way this game comes out before 2020! I'll eat my hat if it comes out in 2020!"
---
Lesson is: just let Blizzard do.
---
I think Alliance will still be more popular than Horde, due to lack of Blood Elves. If you look at even Retail today, and remove BE's from the equation, the Alliance would dwarf the Horde in numbers. I dont think private servers are a good indication of numbers, because that community is hardcore only mostly.
---
The main questions id ask if one just wanted to do pvp ranking are the following:
---
- Am i solo player, or do i have at least 1 player with me in most situations?
---
- How will i earn certain raiding pieces, is my spec desired?
---
If you are a solo player, my best bet would be Hunter. You dont need others, and you can easily grind gold in instances to pay for carries if you cannot find a raid spot. Same goes for Rogues with pick pocketing, and Mages farming ZG. All 3 are good choices. Orc for Rogue and Hunter and UD/Troll for Mage.
---
If you are a group player, then one of you can go Warrior, and the other some type of healer, pref. a Holy Paladin, and you can win BGs all on your own. Finding a raid spot as a Holy Paladin is easier than shooting fish in a barrel, a Warrior maybe not so easy due to sheer prevalence of them, and you cannot grind as easily for gold. But if you two come as a package deal for guilds, then im sure you can find a guild that will give the Warrior a spot if the Holy Paladin is there.
---
In general i think Alliance will do alot better at PvP this time around, because people have realized just how powerful Holy Paladins are in PvP. I dont think that was common knowledge until well into Vanilla back in the day, and even then most players (who were Alliance) didnt really know, since they never had to fight against them.
---
Dire Maul is in Feralas and has three different sections that players can run, each the length of a full dungeon. A lot of the gear in Dire Maul is better than gear available in MC/Onyxia which makes those raids easier to complete and the gear from them less rewarding.
---
It was a Dungeon, but it was released in patch 1.3 and therefore, not at launched, so it needed to be clarified when it was released. Mara was also mentioned, which was in 1.2, but they deemed it early enough (and probably insignificant enough) to just lope into launch.
---
At this point it looks like we will be getting 1.12 stats on all gear, meaning that there will be spell power on gear from endgame dungeons (just no DM) and MC.
---
&gt;Most people who are enjoying BFA will not be playing retail, and vice versa.
---
I disagree with half of this. I think quite a few people who play retail are going to come and play classic. It might not be their main game, but if they're bored they might return and level or run dungeons with some friends. Some will make it their main game as they come to enjoy it more. 
---
I do however agree that it won't go the other way. The player flow is going to be 1 directional.
---
Yep, bought my level 40 mount by crafting and vendoring a ton of nightscape headbands
---
Ray D. Tier
---
Can't wait to read posts from people doing mental gymnastics to try and find something negative about Blizzard on this particular project. They're obviously listening and understand how important this is.
---
They are both good.   I like wotf for locks and shadow priests. 2 big threats.   Stun resist is really nice against pally, druid and warrior charge.   So whichever classes you want more help against.   Although I think orc rogues look badass
---
That’s when you ask him to use it then and there or blacklist him.
---
It’s still a dick move to roll on recipes you don’t need in my book. The recipe is more valuable to the crafter than the gold is to anyone else.
---
Boreal Mantle from BRD is a blue shoulder that adds frost damage and will be in phase one. Same with Briarwood Reed. DM also adds a bunch.
---
Just a couple of examples, but to say there isn't spellpower on blue gear until AQ is disingenuous.
---
You're probably right. Bloodfury can't really be used as a tank, stun resist isn't as useful in pve and axes aren't usually the best option for tanking weapons. 
---
Good on you man. Healers will also be a little shy count wise. If you can maximize the skill gap you’ll be well known by all the raiding guilds on your server. And everyone needs a good wing tank 
---
I remember I was making some gloves out o flight leather, with like 1s profit on each piece
---
DM had really good blue gear (especially for healers) that was better than a lot of the MC/ONY gear (epics), and devalues all the other original 5man dungeons. DM also was a very good farming spot for mages/hunters, where they could farm insane amounts of gold, which would pump large amounts of gold into the economy or put you behind if you aren't a mage/hunter.
---
No they don't, most don't even know it costs mana or is a spell.    
---
Another question is how the mount will be bought. At launch the riding skill cost 100g and the mount 900g, but later on they were swapped around. If they are swapped at launch then you will get the riding skill for free with the mount quest and can buy an epic mount for only 100g. All prices excluding the faction discounts.
---
Sorry but the epic mount quest came out some time after dm was already released. Not at the same time. 
---
&gt; I think you will kill classic
---
lol. People will come back
---
* Phases
---
Stagger content so you don’t have all raids open at the start, which would make a lot of items obselete as soon as guilds get to later raids. Also why people didn’t want ZG/BWL at the same time, which was what was initially planned. 
---
* Itemization 
---
Lots of items had their stats changed or were introduced in later patches, especially 1.10. Blizzard’s initial idea was to have no progressive itemization, which was a bit vague (where would T0.5 fall?) and would make earlier content like MC easier as it’s mostly dungeon loot that becomes stronger in later patches. 
---
TL;DR
---
* Staggering content so that the game is alive longer and items aren’t obselete as soon as they’re available. 
---
* Making items stats update with the corresponding patches they were changed in OG Vanilla mostly to prevent dungeon gear from being miles better than some MC pieces. 
---
I would rather each phase actually be about 4-6 months depending on major content releases.
---
I.e. 
---
Stage 1 ~July 2019
---
Stage 2 ~December 2019
---
Stage 3 ~April 2020
---
Stage 4 ~October 2020
---
Stage 5 ~April 2021
---
Stage 6 ~October 2021
---
Inb4 *That's too slow*.  Not everything is looking to break the world record pace, and be farming MC within the first 72 hours by no lifeing and playing 24/7.
---
feweress*
---
I don't actually. I want new content for Classic. It seems that you don't understand that Vanilla IT WAS and cannot come back.
---
We can only talk about Classic and COMPARE it with Vanilla.
---
I want new content...from a Blizzard that will be able to deliver QUALITY content, this is why I said "IF" Blizzard will be able to regain their lost trust.
---
If they don't, I will (even with disgust) accept TBC over new content. But if they will regain their lost trust...
---
I like your cautious optimism.
---
Id like to see new classic content, but id also like to play tbc. All i really want is for them to balance talents and gear to allow for more variety of raid specs, especially tanks
---
“Everyone knows female dwarves don’t exist!”
---
Orc Rogue isn't that bad imo. Hardiness and Blood Fury are both quite good. 
---
But what about BGs? 
---
Yes, exactly. And more importantly you can play classic instead of that garbage.
---
all lies :(
---
fishing is really slow gold, its the ultimate equalizer of farming because everyone does it at the same speed. IME its really not preferable for grinding gold. good to have for your own consumes, though.
---
as a priest you can farm dm east lashers in holy spec, but on my server this farming method is obsolete due to nerfed drop rates. if you have a big dick you go engi, and do tribute runs in shadow spec.
---
regular beta priests farm satyrs in felwood for decent gold. the upside to this is they drop demonic runes which you will literally always have a use for.
---
Don't forget the world buff (+15% all stats) and the buff you can get from token (+50 stam +50 spirit).
---
&gt; Stuff for cenarion turn ins, or argent dawn turn ins
---
Simpy have these items not stack until the rep patch hits?
---
Want to hoard AD items? OK, use all of your bag space then.
---
Can't wait for the MASSIVE FEEL FEST standing in bloodhoof village at Christmas time. My god has it really been 14 years?
---
Aaah no, not even close. The warlock mount quest costs about 160 raw gold and some crafting materials that may add up to about 300g. The summoning items can be shared among the warlocks, for instance in our guild we have a deal that every lock puts in 50g to me who will buy the summoning mats and help all the locks with their quest, thus saving them hundreds of gold. 
---
Yeah IDK. Funnily enough this makes Classic’s timeline much closer to what pservers do, idk what the OP is on about. 
---
This is really cool
---
I’ll come back in a couple of hours to see why this subreddit feels this is actually terrible
---
Youd need to grind gold for the epic mount training anyway. It's for the best.
---
its worse than cocain...which i have never tried ofc
---
In pvp, it can be huge.
---
Damn!
---
A lot more than I expected to be completely honest, this is awesome!
---
Just adding more phases of content release made me really happy, and then my eyes widen when I saw that they're even going to do progressive itemization.
---
Great news for anyone wanting an authentic vanilla experience! It's going to be way better than any private server so far.
---
You'll still have some people who are not 100% pleased yet.
---
There's still a discrepancy in difficulty between classic and vanilla due to 1.12 talents, skills and spells, etc.
---
For many people (like me) this announcement is good enough. But I'd be surprised if the discussions on this topic were to cease entirely.
---
Blizzard cut down a big tree, but they've left a small stump in the ground, so there's still tons to argue about.
---
I believe Holy paladins didn’t get their opness from holy talents until the talent rework patch in 1.9 which was well into vanilla. 
---
This can be done, without delivering an expansion with new level cap, flying mounts, daily quests, cross-realm, without making old content irrelevant.
---
I understand that people want to play Paladin tanks and Druid tanks, and Shadow Priests or Enha Shamans, etc.
---
But that doesn't mean that TBC is the only way, or the best way.
---
It can be done with new content, preserving the Vanilla game design philosophy. IF Blizzard manages to rebuild their trust...this update is a good start, but there is much more to do on their end.
---
I think the worst one was shattrath in TBC. I still intentionally pronounce it: Sha - thara.  Shat - wrath, sounds like you ate some bad tacos...
---
Glad they are doing this in six phases. This will allow for better progress and will be great overall for Classic. Plus the progressive itemization will be HUGE. Can't wait!
---
Now they need to figure out PVP and I'll be happy.
---
The tier gear is retardedly bad, but the offpieces are pretty good. Cord, choker, robes, mageblade etc are all very good. 
---
I’m going to try to go the full enchanting route again. It’s going to be painful bagspace-wise since I’m going to keep up with Druid gear sets, but I think it’s doable.
---
Profs are best, mining/herbs. Grinding dungeons also isnt terrible and not bad if you want to get AD rep. Priests and Paladins are capable of DME farming, Tanks and healers can work together to DME boss farm as well. Otherwise, like everyone else farms, but slower.
---
How much gold you need to raid per week depends how fast your guild is, what they require of you, what class youre playing, your own professions (you can make or farm some stuff yourself) and the server economy.
---
In a guild that requires no consumes, 5g for repairs and ability consumables (candles, dust, runes etc.) lets say. Guilds that tend to demand max consumes every week tend to be good, so at max, 2 raids a week worth for a Tank would be something like 500g accounting for wipes and extremely expensive Flask of Titans. This could be as low 150g though if Flasks are relatively cheap.
---
People actually used the launcher?
---
Classic is not Vanilla. Didn't you got the memo yet?
---
ZG is a breeze and you don’t run AQ20 for things other than class books and 2-3 items from Ossirian. You just pug those or run them on offnights or whenever you have spare time. 
---
Yes hunters do very good dps in the early game. The problem is that they don't scale very well with their gear. They will always be good in PvP though. 
---
WHEEEEEEE!!!!
---
That is one excited neckbeard
---
Yes. It’s much easier to get in than MC since it’s a 20-man and there are less mechanics that can wipe you. 
---
this makes me feel warm and fuzzy :)
---
RemindMe! One Week
---
If you’re frequently running dungeons it’s not bad.
---
Mageblade doesn't have SP until later I think, can't remember when but it starts with 1% crit and some stats iirc. I can't remember when they did all the revamps as there have been several, but that's why I'm wondering about the AQ comments. But if we get 1.12 stats then it's all good.
---
They have the same option of paying for it everyone else does. 
---
Classic should *never* be changed. It's a historic game which should always be available. This whole project came about because that was not the case. If Blizzard change it, what then? Shall we petition them to bring it back *again*? It's asinine.
---
The same is actually true for the expansions. Neither TBC nor Wrath is available (private servers *definitely* don't count :). They should be, because they are fun, with all their various shortcomings.
---
Now if Blizzard creates *separate* servers for a "Vanilla WoW+" (or whatever you want it called), I don't mind. I won't play them but I won't care if Classic is still available.
---
However I think it's a pipe dream. Blizzard won't do it and if they did you'll will wish they didn't. The Blizzard of old which created Vanilla WoW is no more. Most of the original creative people have left. You won't get anything resembling Vanilla from them ever. (Classic is recreated by a very small team, which mostly (exclusively?) consists of programmers, not creatives.)
---
Also, why would they do that, anyway? Realistically, Classic fans are a small minority. I know that here that seems sacrilegious but that's the truth. After the tourists have left Classic will have a healthy population of a few hundred thousands (I predict around two hundred thousands, at most three). Which is certainly respectable but will only be a small part of the overall WoW playerbase. And all those people will want wildly different things. If you give them Vanilla (or TBC, etc.) some will grumble but all will play. If you try to create something "new", it's a big gamble. Likely a lot of them will not agree with what Blizzard can come up with.
---
It just isn't worth it for Blizzard. Creating Classic is a very small investment for a high, guaranteed payoff. The same is true for the expansions (at least for TBC and Wrath). So that's what they'll do, I'm sure.
---
AFAIK DM healer gear adds something like +200 healing compared to pre-DM preraid BiS among other things. Some DM items are BiS until AQ40 btw. 
---
Paladin and Warlock epic mount quest chains came out in patch 1.4.0. The blue post stated that "the second update will include content that was in original WoW 1.3 and 1.4".  
---
We want TBC because we don't know any better? wtf mate.
---
Sure TBC wasn't perfect, but class mechanics were vastly superior to vanilla, 5mans and heroics were some of the best small group content they ever did, and raiding was head and shoulders above vanilla. We know exactly why we want TBC.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the quick summary!
---
I'm so excited, yet so mortified at the same time. It was my guild that properly looted the head on my server, and the next few weeks were terrible. Lol
---
Will the server start with 16 debuff slots or 8?
---
This is me with tailoring.
---
I love being kitted our in my own gear!
---
Grumpy private server (and Blizard hater) player spotted.
---
I want Classic to be a SUCCESS, and temporary sharding on starter zones vs LOGIN QUEUES, MASSIVE LAG and hundreds of people killing one scorpion every 2 hours, is the BEST WAY TO GO.
---
What you want is a PISS POOR Classic launch, so you can "defend" your shitty private servers.
---
They say in that post that they’re working out the PvP stuff. 
---
You'll be powerful for longer, yes. But if we're being accurate, hunter DPS slows down considerably after MC has been on farm and most classes have their BiS for that raid tier. The only way you'll be competing in DPS as a hunter in BWL is if you get the Xbow from Chromagg right away (or if your warriors/rogues/mages suck).
---
Its not going to be Nost levels of pop on any of the servers. Average servers had, like 10-12 MC guilds per side after the first 2 months in my experience. Thatll average out to 6 people per week doing the Benediction quest and thats not even including the fact that MAYBE, the top 6 Horde and Alliance guilds combined will actually have the Quintessence early on to even summon Domo. 
---
I dont expect too much traffic for the quest honestly.
---
I think overall orc rogue is considered to be the best. Stun resist and that 25% base attack boost are huge. I dunno how it is in later expansions but in classic you get most of your attack from your AGI. So a 25% boost is huge.
---
I’ve got much love for the famous helicopter priests.
---
Most people who are enjoying BFA will not be playing classic beta though.  Unless we get free 60s to go test out MC or something..
---
No. In order to attract players who play other Blizzard games, it will be on the current launcher. You know, people who aren't necessarily following the hype, but are interested.
---
It may also be integrated inside the current version. I don't code things, so I'm unsure. But if it's simply just "servers," I'm sure they could be available in the server select screen.
---
Did you miss the /s or just replied to the wrong person?
---
I think I would prefer six months. I am very busy with work and family. After all, I don't see the game really going anywhere after Naxx. Us players will finally have a chance to explore all of Azeroth and complete **all** the content.
---
Fuck i can't wait for Classic, i still don't know what i wanna play yet.
---
Yup, both Priest and Warlock have fear, which is what they would use prior to silence.
---
A thousand times, yes please. Could be a toggle for the bnet launcher skin. "Classicify" For all of your remakes. Warcraft 3, WoW classic, SC, etc
---
U right 
---
You really BELIEVE that you will have 1k gold in Classic before DM opens? 
---
I think you are CONFUSING Classic with private servers.
---
Took me over a year to hit level cap. Some of us don't have the time.
---
lol
---
They listened!
---
If they come out and say loot trading is scrapped and we have decided that loot is final, and that sharding is only kept for starting zones at launch and there its all saved.  
---
Thank you blizzard, my final shot as a customer to you seems secured!!!!!!
---
You think they sell fleas at the flea market don’t you. +1 if you get the reference 
---
Thank you Blizzard.  
---
Now keep up the good work, and do what you should have done 12 years ago. Keep developping Classic as it should have been. Keep the spirit of Vanilla. Do not make BC or WotlK servers. It was already wasted.  
---
Make the best game ever and go on a 1.14.
---
I was just thinking about the every 4 month bit. I know they had GMs inside the raids watching silently, but not sure about the data mining. Thinking about it now, makes sense to me!
---
Yes, I was being sarcastic.  I tried my hardest to make it obvious.
---
If Tips posted this video y'all would try to hunt him down IRL.
---
No shade at Esfand intended, I'm happy to support anyone who's enthusiastic about Classic WoW and producing content for me to binge.  But attitudes here are mercurial as shit and it comes across as the pinnacle of nerd gatekeeping.
---
Paladins really come into power in guild vs guild and large premade engagements. A paladin can bop that caster the enemy arms warrior just charged. Pop blessing of sacrifice on your warrior to become essentially cc immune, when that is up they you pop bubble or just continue to free cast if you are not being focused. With engagements that will end in under a minute having 30-45 seconds of cc immunity depending on when you need to bubble is ridiculous. 
---
Tbc should be the way to go, it's natural, cost friendly, and simply a great expansion which you know people will love.
---
The last significant one to add to the list would be Warchief's Blessing, 300 HP and 15% melee haste and 10MP5, Horde only
---
LMAO ! 
---
True dat !
---
Anything longer than 4 months will break the original timeline that vanilla was around.  People forget that vanilla ONLY existed on it's own for 26 months before Burning Crusade was announced.   Anything longer than that is just...I dunno; wishful thinking?  You create boredom if you take longer than 4 months per phase.  
---
Also, many people are going to hate this new release schedule.  4 Months is almost too long given the condensing of stuff into patches.  That's 3 content patches a year.  Hearthstone does the same thing (3 major expansions a year) and guess what.  The hearthstone community is always clamoring for the next expansion within 2 months.  
---
Guarantee you that it won't be a problem for the first 6 months or so.  (enough time for 1 release phase to go out) but by the time BWL is out, you're going to have a LOT more guilds ready for BWL and "gear capped" so to speak then originally was done during the original timeline in 2005.  
---
I believe it may be for the best. 
---
Reduced stats on gear, for a while, would slow down the tryhards a bit. For a PVE server, it is irrelevant, but on a PVP server, it helps prevent a small handful of players from dominating for months while casuals slowly catch up.
---
Aren't rogues like the #1 raid melee DPS (probably all dps)? So even if there were a lot of rogues they'd be high in demand still? Also, from leveling back in Vanilla I remember hating my rogue the most (when leveling) so maybe a lot of rogues drop off and never hit 60.
---
It was, but some people are just that oblivious.
---
I mean the profession stuff. Like armor kits or runecloth bags for the writs. Or the stuff for the cenarion logistic badges. It's not a huge deal, but it is something that could be stacked beforehand.
---
You can consider ZG the first "catch-up" patch in WoW.
---
It brought an easier 20 man raid with amazing rewards, better optimized stats than previous gear, even with lower ilevel.
---
ZG was meant for the smaller guilds that couldn't muster up a raid team for MC and BWL, and also made it easier for guilds to get stronger to tackle MC and BWL more easily.
---
Let's have DM in Phase 1, to please Paladins and Warlock.
---
Fuck everyone else, make MC and Ony easy peasy, and have gold farmers rejoice.
---
No thank you.
---
I hope they add that launcher back or atleast let you skin the Blizzard launcher to something similarly as the PLAY button at the moment is silent and has zero personality.
---
I think you missed his /s.
---
OHH the one I was thinking of is between BC and WotLK I think...with the disease that would turn people into scourge?  
---
I've played so long I can't remember what happened when... :(
---
Never played private server so I don’t understand your comment about private server players not liking the fact that Blizzard is listening. Why wouldn’t they like this?  
---
I'm really happy! This is pretty-much exactly what I've been asking for. I would have liked Tier 0.5 to be released earlier (though this would be a little messy due to the Silithus items involved) but otherwise this is perfect.
---
Now the focus should be on when the major PVP milestones will be happening. 
---
I'll have to go and study what this does to my pre-raid BIS now also. BRD being full of crappy greens for the first year is a bit of a downer - lack of +hit will hurt but will add to the challenge of MC and BWL I guess.
---
I don't see how you come to this conclusion, because tons of people who were playing BfA dropped it for the Blizzcon demo. I know most of my guild did.
---
you are talking about blizzard... they'll trying to keep classic alive as long as they can to keep those subs rolling. 
---
What will happen is that we'll see 6 months in between each patch.
---
This is amazing
---
Psychic scream rank 1 costs more than 2 rank 2 smites, fear is....well, fear is interesting. Maybe that works.
---
&gt; they couldn't handle the power of nature and anime. 
---
[( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlwda9S58Lg)
---
HOLY SH\*T....They listened!!!
---
 \- Good job guys
---
They CLEARLY said that the itemization from 1.10 will be in Phase 5.
---
So, yes, until Phase 5, the itemization will be as it was before 1.10
---
"MC will be cleared by guilds in greens"...not anymore :)
---
So you are saying it's not expensive, and also that you need to have others pay in and use the same stuff? Doing it yourself I have seen estimates up to 750-800 gold depending on prices of the mats. It is a discount, but it isn't like it costs 200 gold when everyone else pays 1k.
---
5 is the new 10.
---
FANTASTIC NEWS
---
I stopped this as soon as I saw Lupos. Getting tired of this PS/Classic overlap. 
---
Similar shit with warrior /sit fighting. 
---
It worked in vanilla, they stopped it in wrath I believe.
---
Thank you! Why would a normal dungeon drop better gear than MC since it’s a raid?
---
With that said i dont want it to be too quick. Its vanilla after all
---
bro during the summer im going to move my comp down into the basement where it's cooler so that I can play for literally 10-12 hours a day.
---
Well, more so for PvP and PvE Tanks and DPS. I you're PvE healing, you don't need engineering.
---
Sure, but the fact is that someone has to pull strings and keep watch.
---
Something similar here. Although I do plan on raiding extensively, just not rushing to do so. :)
---
I've even created a guild for it: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azrefd/looking_for_group_monday_march_11_2019/ei9r9j6/
---
Pretty sure there was a blue post about this summer. 
---
Release date is summer 2019.
---
Subscription is the only cost.
---
If you play a warlock you for sure know it costs mana.  The whole grind of a warlock is about balancing health and mana with mana regen vs spirit tap you can bet your ass you feel that 100 mana and delayed mana regen starting at level 40.  
---
The real reason as a warlock I bought the normal mount was getting interrupted while trying to mount in the open world.  If someone catches you off guard and gets a counterspell while you're trying to mount... well you're just shit out of luck.  They get such a huge advantage in that fight.
---
Holy crap that seems pretty extreme for dungeon gear.
---
They said that they FULLY recovered 1.12.1 data. And they also said that they have data from PREVIOUS PATCHES, but NOT ENOUGH to build Classic on any of them.
---
Blizzard have plenty of data from patches previous to 1.12.1...just NOT ENOUGH for a build.
---
Hope this answers your question about itemization.
---
Oh absolutely. I will relish a slow release of content. I want to see the reason they would push a patch. Like above 50% of the Playerbase clearing a certain checkpoint. 
---
That's an excellent explanation. Take an upvote.
---
4-5 months is ideal. I think 6 is taking it too far
---
Yeah I'm a little confused as well. Idk why making videos is a bad thing.
---
Does this mean auction houses will not be linked from the start?
---
That sounds great! I also expressed concerns with Dire Maul's loot trivialising other dungeon's loot and I'm so happy to hear that taken care of. So much HYPE!
---
Great news! I was hoping for a mention of adjusting the AQ War Effort but this is still really great. I think holding off on DM is the right choice as well as separating BWL from ZG. 
---
Getting pumped.. 
---
Tinker around with the beta..?  Maybe..  A demo is a demo to tinker around with.  It's nothing like a beta where you start with a fresh character.  I can't see anyone enjoying BFA getting much past level 6 or 10 just playing around in the starting zones.  It simply takes too much time to do anything, and if it's not permanent there is no carrot on that stick.
---
Ok, now is a good time to get those BiS lists going 😁
---
I care too baby
---
Some of the rep rewards for wsg/ab/especially av are really good. 
---
Priest; theres far more tools to deal with incoming damage, while learning the new abilities and how they perform might be difficult, its far easier to keep a group alive having these options available.
---
I do NOT recommend Paladin if youre new to healing, it takes very good time management to keep people healed. The people advising this likely havent played many of the healing classes. The "easy" part is that you have only direct heals, so its "simple". But that creates an enormous problem that you have no ability to heal other than just brute forcing direct heals on people. A bad Paladin will wipe everytime on an AoE fight or a fight with adds where theres multiple targets taking damage. You have to time your heals and know exactly when each person is going to take damage so that no one dies. Priests on the other hand can precast Renew and PWS people to buy them extra casting time, Paladins only have BoP, which if used on caster getting swarmed, usually just means that youll be getting swarmed, which necessitates Divine Shield, 2 GCDs in a row while no one is getting healed.
---
In raids, its reversed, since youre part of a big mass of healers, you have the best heal spam in the game, but for Dungeons, Paladins are the absolute hardest to play. In raids though in general, healers arent too difficult to play.
---
As for Shamans, second most difficult after Paladin, you have a little more leeway for AoE fights with Chain Heal and Lesser Healing Wave healing for a lot, but you have to manage your mana well.
---
Druids id say are the second easiest, though people tend not to like Druids because they have no normal rez ability.
---
They make the same arguments for this that Retailers made against having Classic in the first place. "You think you do, but you don't." "My version is the best, no others should be allowed." "It would divide the community." "We already know the content."
---
Those are rookie numbers. You gotta pump these numbers up
---
Half the time as a raider was jumping around the squares of iron forge. I think the ‘grind’ factor at max level is really over played. Most of it is optional. 
---
I completed Naxx at 60 without an epic mount. We didn’t use flasks or potions other than on the main tank. Much of vanilla was for fun and exploration and not mandatory. You can easily keep up with progression with two nights a week. It’s just finding the guild with the right rota. 
---
I'm gonna have to buy a new copy of the game. I don't want to be linked to that Blizzard.net account they made us all create ten years ago as there are a bunch of people on my friends list I don't intend to ever speak to again.
---
Except for one dude. But I'll find him on Facebook.
---
Time may be money, but money is not time.
---
Before converting your time into money you must first consider that which time can afford, but money cannot.
---
Also, inflation.
---
This is really the point where they changed my expectation that they not only what a cheap moneygrap and actually are still a company that cares about their community, despite all the financial pressures.
---
And thank goodness they do because they get us talking about it and, shocker: 
---
&gt;Currently, based on both your feedback and our own deliberations
---
Blizzard is watching. 
---
Literally no difference whatsoever. I've played both factions since release and you have good and bad people on both sides. 
---
TBC was a great expansion. I just hated flying mounts so much. Great content though.
---
I don't know Blizzard's reasons. This was pretty early, they may not have given it much thought.
---
It was that way in vanilla. It didn’t come out until later.
---
Also, depending on the guild you are in, this may offset some costs.  Our guild bank paid for the flasks for the guild, but we had to donate to the guild every week. 
---
I think I had to donate like 50g a week or something like that and I never had to pay for a consumable outside of health pots.
---
I think ran out of there every time with a train of Kobolds following me due to respawns and not wanting to clear my way back out.
---
Bro do it. They are so insanely op in world pvp until lvl45 it’s great fun 
---
LMAO. "We have to go back!"
---
Maybe they will add "skins" or "themes" to the bnet launcher and make this available!
---
Same, I want it slower this time. I can't put in 40 hours a week into the game as I did in 2006/2007. Instead I would be lucky to manage 10. Would love to see the release cycle last 3+ years.
---
As a Warlock you can interrupt spell casting with Fear, and then break the Fear early with Curse of Recklessness if needed.
---
I highly doubt the beta will only be starter zones. Yes, that is going to be a large portion of their stress testing for server capacity, but they also need to see what it's like with hundreds or thousands filling up Orgrimmar and Ironforge. I would think they would offer a pre-built level 30 or something to see what it's like then, because starter zone overcapacity isn't an issue past the first week of launch.
---
So, you want to farm Molten Bore for 10 months?
---
Way to kill the game in its first year.
---
nope
---
If everyone was perfectly knowledgeable and only interested in efficiency, an hour spent efficiently at any 'important' task would be worth roughly the same.  Making more gold than that is simply praying on the ignorance of others.
---
I'm crying, we get the original. WE can go truly home again.
---
You felt something 
---
It's a hard knock life.
---
I just want to fish and herb, while leeching honor in AV.
---
Lol yeah wtf? Was thinking the exact same thing. I don’t care who posts what. It’s just a weird observation 
---
Honestly I figured they would do something like that.  Just progress classic like the original games.
---
I genuinely never knew that. That's actually kind of cool. 
---
I might actually just forego the Dreadsteed for a wolf instead. One because I won't want to wait and two because the Dreadsteed questline is a hassle. 
---
Glad they posted news in progress instead of a flashy processed update chunk "still unsure about [thing]" is just fine because it's not a creation of a new game and letting things breathe is only going to help Classic.
---
&gt; starter zone overcapacity isn't an issue past the first week of launch
---
They could test out their sharding technology! (/S)  Yeah per my original comment they would need to be handing out some premade characters to get BFA players in for more than a trivial glance around.
---
True statement. Credit shall be earned if the release is good but I'm loaning Blizzard credit for the way they're handling the project thus far. Your earlier sentence is harsh toward a project that actually appears to be well designed thus far, employing many passionate people. 
---
Just one major injury with right click reporting and a few bad bruises with sharding and loot trading (which I expect will pertain only to greeded items so not ultimately a huge problem).
---
Ahh forgot that one. Also alliance can get it if they get Mind Controlled by horde players whilst inside Orgrimmar but it’s a huge pain. 
---
&gt; have the Quintessence early on to even summon Domo. 
---
Forgot about that.  Didn't you have to get exalted with the water dudes for that?
---
yeah 8.5 is considering you got everything, no wait time, no tagging fight, doing all questing.
---
Realistically - Launch will be impossible to hit those time. 12-12 hours, possible but difficult. I am on my 3rd priest run and I am currently 19 @ 12hr mark. so 20 at the 13.5 hr mark.
---
People hate on Tips cus the highest he ever got in vanilla was 38 or something. And we all know that everyone on this sub killed KT and got rank 14. 
---
NEW CONTENT means the opposite of changing Classic.
---
I want Classic to always exists, without any changes.
---
But I also want SOMETHING DIFFERENT after Classic...not TBC. In 2 years, Classic servers will become a museum, with less than 1% of the Classic player base still playing on Classic servers, 2 years after launch.
---
What will the other 99% do? Play TBC? Play NEW Classic content, new content that CAN (and should) be gated behind new attunements? Like a tier 3.5 raid that requires killing Kel'Thuzad in Naxx? Like a new lvl 60 dungeon that rewards T1 equivalent gear that requires killing Ragnaros? And so on?
---
What would you REALLY want AFTER 2 years of playing Classic? Because KEEP playing Classic will NOT be an option for the VAST majority of players.
---
MASSIVE changes to patch progression to mirror ORIGINAL vanilla. HUGE news. *surprised face thumbnail* 
---
Yeah I do, but trust me, most people playing vanilla know nothing about the game. 
---
Any attack will interrupt your mounting spell, only difference is that if someone counterspells your mount spell it also locks you out of those spells. I've yet to see it happen though. 
---
For as much as everyone here likes to wax poetic about community and friendliness, when it comes to video content they like to act like the ["seat's taken" kids from Forrest Gump.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzV7pOtze4)
---
It happened to me enough times in vanilla thought I bought a standard epic mount...  I did world pvp a lot though.
---
Good plan, though I'd ask two questions. On a fresh server, do you think it'll make more sense to start out as an enchanter until you get your two wands, and then drop it for skinning or w/e else? Also worth asking if getting Tailoring right away will be more profitable than skinning while leveling. On a fresh server, I'd imagine most of the thnigs you make to level tailoring will sell on the AH.
---
Also, with gold at a premium, while also saving for your mount, I imagine leveling Engineering soley at the discretion of the AH will be a nightmare. I wonder if going Alch would be more beneficial, utilizing all the herbs youve gathering the entire tme.
---
I guess it boils down to the crossover point where the benefit of engineering outweighs the cost and hassel of leveling engineering witout mining on a fresh server.
---
You didn't read everything I wrote.
---
You either want TBC because you didn't knew better...OR,  OR...you don't trust Blizzard.
---
Or you want to play a Paladin tank, and screw everyone else, "gief me TBC".
---
Sauce?
---
Splitbone necklaces anyone ?
---
Things not on your list: "I want to play TBC because it's a really good game"
---
Incoming fourteen different YouTube videos of some doofus behind the camera reading the blue post without much thoughtful input. We all know who I’m talking about...
---
Or do we...? 
---
Either CC them or burst had enough. Healing mobs are a pain no matter the class, especially as warrior where you need to swap to shield+def stance to shield bash prior to getting Pummel. 
---
Non-raiders will have PLENTY TO DO, with or without T 0.5
---
It's Classic mate...there is PLENTY to do outside raiding.
---
I can just read the thread here lol.
---
That requires me to give up control first, and my 'blacklist' is worthless. I would rather have the 1000g.
---
Yes I get it was a dick move and there are many scenarios where I would not have done it, but there was nothing indicating this guy was going for the recipe, it was a pug, and it had value to everyone because it had gold value. For me it was the equivalent of a free epic mount dropping.
---
Just because it would have been the most efficient, overall, to allocate to him, doesn't mean it was the most efficient for me. Had it been a guildy or friend where I would see a net benefit, then I probably would have passed, but most likely this guy would be selling my those flasks on the AH for a profit.
---
Since the login fields in the client are still there, someone could make a custom launcher that just launches wow.exe.
---
uff yes please
---
Proof that there is still fantastic staff over at Blizzard. :)
---
Wrong.  Blink on R, counterspell on V and polymorph on C
---
I still think that you're crazy if loot trading &amp; ez reporting will ruin the experience for you. I don't think they have the staff organization or management to handle the old system. They've built templates for teams of people to manage these issues &amp; they aren't going to re-implement old systems like that. It's not an in-game issue as much as it's an employee issue. I still think it would be best to make the reporting system excruciating to the point where you'll only report something who **seriously** did something wrong. This would help the staff be more efficient (Who's probably already bare bones). I'll agree that "right click" reporting is over the top &amp; casual.
---
To your point about content. I like to regurgitate my idea. I think it's a mistake not to increase the level cap, &amp; to simply "add content" to vanilla. I don't want to get to level 60 and compare to another level 60 who has burning crusade numbers of health. I think you get to a point where it's safe to add to the level cap. 
---
I do agree, however, that they shouldn't be limited to releasing classic versions of the expansions. The story lines behind Wrath &amp; TBC were great &amp; really followed up on major unfinished story lines from WC3. I'd love to see the community &amp; Blizzard bring about new ideas for a different time line (not timelines that are interchangeable. They can't interact. That's stoopit). 
---
* Wotlk really should have been the first expansion given the context of Vanilla's conclusion (Scourge invasions &amp; Naxxramas), but I think they were going for new races. They probably didn't have a reliable way of bringing Blood Elves into the game without forcing Kael'Thas into the fray, &amp; Draenei without Outland. I also think it would be a fresh change for people looking to continue the adventure. 
---
* We really should be moving on to other things on Azeroth before we hit up Sargeras or even Outland. Sargeras is the most evilest &amp; strongerest being out there. I think it would make sense for us to not really understand how to beat him, while Illidan in Outland is focusing solely on Sargeras' demise. Outland would make an epic ending expansion, with a combination of what they did in Legion with Illidan. Idk.
---
* The purpose of Classic is to **currently**allow players to play at a point of time in the game that's no longer available. It wouldn't make sense for them to progress **all** of the classic servers into a new expansion. I would hope that they release new servers for the new expansions &amp; allow **paid character transfers** to progress players into the new content. They'd have to be cheap or possibly bundled, but it would be a great way for them to all players to play at whatever level they want. Finished with Vanilla on your hunter? Transfer him! Only finished BLW on your priest? Keep her there! I'd like to see character transfers in packs of 1, 3, 5, &amp; 10. Each lowering the cost of the individual transfers slightly. 10 should be like $40, 1 should be like $10. but idk.
---
* Expansions need to be altered to have flying mounts removed. My question is, do they remove the mounts entirely? Or do they just remove the flying ability? but Idk.
---
ZG came about a year into Vanilla, if I remember correctly.
---
Edit : September 13th, 2005. 
---
I don't think it is a good idea.
---
I played Vanilla WoW over the course of 2 years the first time around. I don't want to sit around for a year waiting for ZG and BWL again. Outside of a slim minority I doubt many of you *really* want to play Classic WoW for 2 years straight.
---
If Blizzard does not accelerate the content release schedule then they will lose a lot of players who become bored while waiting for the content that they signed up to see.
---
First things first, serious ranking isn't easy no matter what faction you decide to play. It's long hours of nothing but bgs and ganking. Alliance might have the 'easier' time because queues are shorter and maybe instant--this is really dependent on the size of the factions and the server's pvp pop btw--but they usually have to sacrifice highly coveted bracket spots. In other words, just because alliance has instant BG queues, they might only have 1 to 2 bracket 1 spots, meaning you're fighting with every other alliance pvper to grab it. Meanwhile, horde is out in the world scrapping for every honor point they can find, but they've got 4 bracket 1 spots to fight over. They're both difficult in different ways.
---
So, the main consideration is how much time you're willing to dedicate to it. If it's what you want to do in Classic, make friends with the other pvpers on your server--trust me, you'll meet and know every single one of them--and really learn your class well. Engineering and an epic mount are an absolute must. Skull of impending doom is a must. Consumables are a must (not necessarily flasks, but basic things like speed pots, lips, flash bombs for druid fcs, mana/hp pots, and faps). 
---
Luckily, we're not getting ranking at the start. That means we're going to have plenty of farm time to get ready. Even though I plan on ranking a priest, my first love in Vanilla, I'm strongly considering going mage at launch for the aoe farming. It was going to be hunter because dm farming is insane, but now that is out of the question, mage might be the play.
---
Min maxing your race and everything isn't a massive deal, but you will notice it. Just a quick example, if you're an orc and you end up resisting a rogue opener, it's most likely the difference between life and death or capping a flag or whatever. I wouldn't worry about it too much though since most race/class combos have their benefits.
---
As to your bonus question, everything past 11 is "you must sacrifice your life" mode. You might be able to squeeze a r12 playing 'casual', but it's going to be hard. R13-14 is bracket 1 every week for weeks on end. Full no life mode.
---
True, but only AV and AB are reasonably grind-able.  The WSG rep is so slow to obtain, especially if you are pugging or facing turtles all the damn time.
---
Yes this is very important
---
World pvp is what made me stick to the game for so long. Fighting/ganking BRM groups was so damn fun
---
The Naxx event involves the zigguraths and undead that appear around azeroth. The pre-wrath event was basically the same thing with the addition of the plague and zombies. 
---
Rogues are considered to be the slowest levelers other then paladins. Other then that the pvp is real good. Leveling a rogue sucks. As far as dps slot. They are always a T1 DPS but at some point warriors will start dealing more damage. Warriors have the highest dps in the game.
---
All of that being said. No one knows who the highest dps on retail will be because things don't actually work as they should on private servers. One example on this is armor reduction on private servers. Use flat numbers with no diminishing returns. This means most bosses on private servers are being killed at 0 armor. This will most likely not be the case on retail/.
---
Nope, it's not complicated at all. Most guilds will have 40 solid raiders, 10 more raiders as backup and 20+ casuals.
---
Making 2x20 men raids will be EASIER than making one 40 men raid actually.
---
You need to be Honored and complete the "Hands" quest to kill the 4 Flamewaker bosses in MC. You can technically do this in 1 week by farming Hydrax rep, either MC trash farming or Silithus elemental farming. Only the hardcore guilds tend to do this and Domo is usually downed in week 3 or 4 for most guilds.
---
The Aqual Quintessence is also consumable, so you need 8 per raid, or a few people ferrying Quintessence back and forth from Azshara, though it has a 1 hour CD so you generally need at least 2 people.
---

I was wondering.. I always appreciated his content / his appearances on classicast. Then I come here and the whole sub is just bashing him lol 
---
credit to u/crazya_2001 whose picture I shamelessly stole, googling "epic world drop"
---
No changes. 
---
My goal is to be the guild enchanter. I plan on leveling up professions while leveling, so as a warlock I should be able to actually so that and still get my mount at 40.
---
Start the hype! This small Blizzard team is our last hope and they appear to be listening!
---
You need to buy the xorothian stardust for 150g and at least one shadowy potion for 3g or 6g, I can't remember which. Then you need some crafting mats that will vary wildly depending on the economy. If you are herb/alch you can farm some of it yourself. Then you do some quests in Felwood and Scholomance. The finale is summoning the dreadsteed and its owner in DM W. To do this you need 3 items that cost 150g and 2x 50g, 250g in total. The thing is that you don't use these items when summoning the boss. So if you are maybe 5 warlocks in the guild you can all chip in 50g so one warlock buys the summoning mats and helps the other warlocks through it. 
---
A conservative estimate is about 400g including all the mats. 
---
Also, the normal epic mount doesn't cost 1k gold. You get faction discounts on everything depending on how much reputation you've got. I think at exalted it's 20% but I'm not entirely sure. You get a 10% PvP discount on the mount if you are rank 3 so all in all you'll pay a bit under 800g for the entire thing.

So I am deviating from going straight to Redridge and gonna see if picking up the 14-19 quests in Westfall is to my benefits before going to Redridge and continuing the vanilla guide. 
---
I took a gamble of seeing how much XP Hogger gave as an level 11 elite quest and it gave me 350xp but I also managed to pick up Elmore Quest in Goldshire and I am hoping that can offset or make it worth running to Goldshire. 
---
While I recognize raiding is certainly an important part of it, there's so much more to classic WoW than raiding the same 40 mans that have existed for 12-15 years.
---
!member 2 weeks
---
The goal of these changes is to more closely emulate the vanilla patch progression. Any benefit or harm to the experience of people primarily interested in PVP is coincidental.
---
Then why do people care about the release schedule so much?
---
This guy gets it, that guy gets it.
---
Yes mageblade gets updated in patch 1.4, before that it's not so great. I bet a lot of people threw a hissy fit over having disenchanted the previous useless mageblade. 
---
Almost every patch changed the items somewhat. I know for warlocks they change the tier items like 3-4 times. 
---
You can look at all the changes in detail [here.](https://itemization.github.io/)
---
It would also also those who play the game more for PvP than raiding to not be that out-geared from the raiders. Presumably closer to MC/On clears than the previous schedule, without world boss, BWL, and ZG loot, but DM which is reachable as a 5 man for the non-raiders.
---
Basically how it was during retail vanilla. I can't wait!!
---
Underdog faction on your server = faster queues. 
---
Pick a class you want to play. Some classes can be more impactful than others. Race doesn’t matter as much as your skill and time played. 
---
Server types would change the bracket sizes. There’s less players in a pve server’s honor pool which doesn’t make it any easier to rank. In fact, if there’s under 500 players in a given week, it’s impossible for the top honor earner to get progress from R13–&gt;R14 because the decay hits harder than the gains from bracket 2. 
---
Also PVP servers are better because of a larger pool, bigger pop usually and being able to farm honor outdoors. 
---
R10-11 are as close as you’ll get to obtainable through “casual” play. R12+ require much more time investment. 
---
I'm probably going to get flamed for this but I'm not too bothered about the changes. (Except for sharing.)
---
That said, I'm in the "no changes" camp because I think Blizzard needs to see how this game works to remind them how WoW used to work and use that as inspiration for better changes in the live game. For this to happen, we need as few changes as possible.
---
I'm just disillusioned, I stuck up for Blizzard after they said they'd drop yearly expansions in WoD and I thought Legion was proof that they were on their A-game again and so I didn't listen to the bad feedback BFA was getting.
---
And all this stuff with the last Blizzcon and general difficulties since then. If Activision Blizzard wasn't such a big company they'd be fucked.
---
I just want to play a WoW that wasn't made in a spreadsheet and the methods to fleece people of their money despite the game being subscription based. 
---
What if I start whining about how I want original AV? Think that might work?
---
I feel a major issue with TBC is that raids go down to 25 man from 40 man.
---
Alongside a number of other reasons.
---
No news on if they'll add them, but all indications is that they're adding very few if any changes introduced in later versions of WoW; most of those changes are QoL (read: back-end stuff related to the servers, or accessibility options for people with color-blindness). I would be very surprised if we see guild banks added.
---
Some people are just fickle assholes. the only thing to do is ignore them, as I'm sure tips does. Personally I like having something to listen to while I do the dishes.
---
Same here, this is the like the first meme that actually made me laugh. There are so many mixed feelings into this one, it's not straight into your face.
---
My leeroy would be only allowed to vendor his pocket money into wow if I created a guild for him, consisting only of the other little leeroys of the none-redneck-parents I checked out inside my neighborhood.  ... if that makes sense.
---
Tips is the worst. Guy brings retail attitude to classic content. 
---
&gt; I'll give the company credit when the live version of the game isn't modelled after a slot machine and mobile game design.
---
I'm not sure if you mean modern WoW, or the live version of classic.
---
If you're waiting to see if classic stays on message, fair enough I guess.
---
If you're talking about modern WoW, that's just a case of you not liking it. Which is okay, lots of people do. Different games designed for different audiences.
---
In the nordics we just call them Shmöömeltanzenauflauf.
---
Yea, but getting Engineering on a fresh server without mining is going to be the worst. 
---
If that proves to be correct... :P
---
"Blizzard FINALLY listens to us" lmao, yeah they needed some fringe youtube neckbeards, they couldn't possibly figure things out for themselves, those amateurs. Lucky the true heroes have prevailed. jfc
---
I suppose that’s true but you got to get out in the world and quest when things get stale. 
---
I only played until level 15-20 in vanilla and spent most of my time in TBC and WotLK. Still very looking forward to getting into classic once it drops!
---
Can you explain what the problem was/is with the loot progression? I've seen it mentioned a couple of times with the recent news and I am curious what was previously wrong with it and what was announced to be changing. Thanks for any insight!
---
I am alright with this change.
---
The absence of guild banks will not prevent some from paying for extra accounts to serve as "guild bank mules." It might as well be available for everyone, instead of only those with the "dedication" to violate the ToS and pay for more bank space.
---
I played from launch and TBH i do not remember DM ever NOT being in the game. I think in the 4 months it took me to level to 60 it was released.
---
Hi, /u/letezia
---
&gt; Some guilds will be substantially faster than others. Would not like to see the progression too fast 
---
A 4 month equal split per phase would be extremely balanced. It will take 2 months for MOST guilds to have enough lvl 60 to even begin raiding.
---
Some top guilds will start MC in under a month, and will farm MC for 3 months before BWL is released. 3 months of MC farming will means roughly 240 items (10 bosses x 2 drops x 12 weeks) for a raid of 40 people, which is basically (in perfect conditions) 6 items per member. Add Ony with another 40-50 items, and a guild that farms Ony and MC for 12 weeks, will have their roster properly geared for BWL.
---
But for ANYONE else, except 1-2 guilds / faction / realms?
---
So, progression will be NORMAL. 4 months per phase will be long enough for top guilds to raid every single week for gearing up, and short enough for casual guilds to still struggle in MC 1 month after BWL is released.
---
It's direct from Blizzard.
---
I very vaguely remember this.  I never farmed for the rep in Silithus, I just got the rep going through MC since others already had it. 
---
pretty sure it's more than 40 cloths needed to make enough greens to hit 10 enchanting.
---
With a bit of hope...they will change the mats:)
---
Naxx patch.
---
Ok, so it's in the middle then. Figure the first guy is paying 400G for all the stuff he needs (Your numbers if I interpreted that right) plus the mats which are going to be costly at first but depend entirely on the economy (And if your guild chips in mats). Then everyone after that only pays 153 (156?) plus mats and has to bring the first guy.
---
[Guild banks weren't introduced until patch 2.3.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.3.0) I think it's safe to say they won't be in Classic.
---
Commenting to tag along for this answer.
---
How do Blizzard betas work these days (haven't played one in years), will anyone be able to join the beta PTR or is it still invite-only?
---
It will be too much to explain for you to understand, since you only started in Legion.
---
Basically, the half the topics on this sub are related to why we didn't liked the 4 initial phases and LOVE this new 6 phase content release.
---
The entire questline has been known for years, so yes.
---
Limited sharding, I can get use to.
---
16 raid slots, I actually prefer anyway as it expands class spec participation. Better overall for the game.
---
True differences in Classic game play and server load I prefer anyway.
---
But, this content schedule was a MAJOR issue for me just like it was for many, so THIS IS AMAZING DAMN NEWS! WOOT!
---
Unlikely, since that would be changing it to be different than Vanilla WoW was.
---
This - 
---
I remember we drastically needed some druids in my guild and would often raid with just 1.  Most of the druids we would recruit were complete garbage and we would have like 8 pally's instead. 
---
Our Druid was geared outrageously fast though. 
---
? what do you mean...?  I'm thoroughly confused by your statement.  Are you insinuating that the sub likes to be ambivalent towards certain topics?
---
Is it that big of a deal though? Every class &amp; race should have strengths and weaknesses.
---
Are they going to have all those old servers online? Thinking of getting the band back together on Stonemaul.
---
What you should have done is claimed to be an alchemist. When they challenged you on it and told you to use the recipe right then and there, you equip your Argent Dawn trinket and reequip your other trinket in rapid succession. The game will play the animation like you learned a new recipe.
---
6-8 hours a day is more than a full time job, that already qualifies for \#nolife status.
---
Around patch 1.10 they changed the values of some items but more importantly they added a ton of new drops. These drops and new values basically made it a lot easier to do past content, so it was only intended to be around after the past content was completed 
---
I just got a flashback to the start of BC and trying to sort out Kara raids, lol.
---
Not to argue this, but multiple raids is always harder than one raid from a coordination perspective. Different players progressing at diferent speeds with a divide in leadership.
---
That said, as was also answered, both raids can probably be done on off-nights in a more casual fashion. I'm assuming the gap between content won't be too long.
---
Yeah, I get it.  It's just hypocritical that for as much as this sub likes to wax poetic about "community," they act like a bunch of gatekeeping jerks.  For shaaaaame.
---
Looks like a female dwarf that put its head in a bee hive. 
---
Holy shit lmao do you main a rogue? Cause if you don't you seriously should :).
---
Good save, you would have been eviscerated for that UI.
---
People shouldn’t even factor in rank 14 gear into their thoughts about itemisation or their character plan
---
Such a tiny tiny proportion of even hardcore players will get their hands on the stuff
---
“It could be a three-parter, called 'Ruler of the Bracelet'. The first part would be called 'The Brotherhood of the Bracelet', followed by 'A Couple of Towers', with the climactic ending called 'Hey, the King's Back!'"
---
I mean, every change here is pretty much one he requested, so he can take at least a little credit for highlighting those parts of the community’s frustrations and bringing it to blizz’ attention.
---
God this update has me so hype.
---
This is a nearly best-case scenario update.
---
We aren't whining at Tips and the other guys. Their work and what they express is vital.
---
Of course, assuming Blizzard don't change the required mats to stop guilds from hoarding up all the mats as soon as classic releases, making the opening of the gates a non event. 
---
&gt;Edit: I also don't like the fact that your T3 gear gets replaced immediately during the new expansions. I feel like you should at the very most have to replace it during level 70 dungeons, or around 68 quests. They could make the power increase a little more gradual. :)
---
That was basically the case with T3 though. Especially for DPS, Naxxramas gear was actually on par with dungeon blues. The main drawback was that TBC gear just had tons more stamina that could make running around in T3 risky.
---
Hoping for a hard limit on internet speed to maybe 200-300 kb/s. And the only way to get on classic servers is by installing 8 different discs.
---
LMW only requires 10 enchanting.
---
GMW is the one that requires 70 enchanting.
---
You will see both for sale by players on the first day. 
---
That's fine, most ppl won't even get an epic mount ever 😀 
---
Are you trolling
---
Yes if you buy all the mats alone it will be pretty expensive, but you can share the cost with other warlocks in your guild. If you don't have a guild then there's usually also warlocks who sell the summoning as a service for a fee, about 50g which will save you 200g on the total price. It's actually a decent way of making some gold as well if you decide to buy the summoning items. 
---
Lastly, the crafting mats you need was greatly reduced in TBC, so we wary where you source the list. 
---
Here's a complete list:  
---
   
---
 35 Black Dragonscale : Skinned from Dragons in Upper Blackrock Spire   
---
25 Dark Iron Ore : Can be mined in Blackrock Depths or Molten Core   
---
10 Elixir of Shadow Power : Made by an Alchemist, requires 3 Ghost Mushroom   
---
6 Large Brilliant Shard : Obtained by disenchanting items of blue quality, level 51 and over   
---
3 Arcanite Bar : Arcane Crytal are mined from Rich Thorium veins, note  this is a rare item. Added to a Thorium Bar an alchemist uses Transmute  Arcanite (with a cooldown of 48 hours) to create your bars.  
---
I remember back in TBC I ran DS/Ruin.  It absolutely was a DPS LOSS to do anything but CoE and SB spam.  You just didn't cast corruption at all.  
---
Most fun I've had in WoW ever too!
---
We need to know if 5 man items are going to be pre or post-buff. Some items received a big buff around 1.6 (the deathbone set comes to mind), and it’d be nice to know if they’re blue at launch or if we can hold them. 
---
If each phase is 3 months, which sounds pretty reasonable, that's 12+ weeks at level cap before DM is released.
---
84 days.
---
11.9 gold needed to be farmed per day.
---
Yes, I'll have 1,000 gold by the time DM is launched.
---
Oh maaan I swear I checked wowhead like 5 times.. Thanks that makes a HUGE difference.
---
Because they hate Blizzard, they want Classic to fail, and this update proves that Blizzard LISTENS to us, which is a BIG THING for WoW players.
---
Blizzard listening to players = Blizzard regaining trust.
---
Private server players always said that Classic will fail, private servers are more Vanilla-like than Classic, Blizzard doesn't give a fuck about what players want, etc. etc.
---
This update, BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, proves that Blizzard is LISTENING to us. And they DELIVER (as much as possible) what we want, and also pretty much settles the fate of private servers.
---
If Blizzard removes Loot Trading (which they will) and right-click report (which they will)...without a doubt, private servers will be DEAD.
---
And lots of private server players DO NOT WANT private servers dead...which is why they want Classic and Blizzard TO FAIL.
---
Incorrect. 40 and 60 mount grant the appropriate riding skills.
---
Found private server lover and Blizzard hater.
---
This update was as good as it could possibly have been.
---
1.13.
---
I mean modern WoW, I honestly don't understand how anyone can enjoy it. 
---
What I mean is that there has to be more to a game than RNG. You need goals and reasons to keep rolling the dice towards a long-term goal. (Not to mention that the rewards need to be proportional to effort and effort shouldn't be hamstrung relative to luck.)
---
Not to mention, the world feeling so absolutely small even though it's technically the largest it's ever been.
---
I think it sucks because I used to really enjoy this game. I've been playing since just before TBC was released. I hate what WoW has become and I can't wait for the original game to be released even if it will be unbalanced as heck and totally clunky to play. At least this game has a soul.
---
The only part of Modern WoW that has a soul is the art and the music. 
---
oh fuck. that's beastmode shit
---
great pic btw
---
Sorry to spam off your post, but do you think it would be worth taking enchanting just to get to 10 to make a wand, then dropping it for something else? I guess 10 means getting 10 greens to disenchant which is no way going to happen before level 12 really?
---
Even though id like them, its lookin like no.
---
Loot from dungeons in vanilla was a combination of mediocre and utter crap. Part of that was they were still learning to itemize (spell damage wasn't even in at launch, that's why the vanilla UI doesn't even bother to show caster gear stats). However the other part was that at the start, dungeons could be run by 40 people, and were later tuned down to 10. Blizzard didn't want to put good loot in places people could steamroll. That's why Dire Maul at release is such a huge deal. Dire Maul gear was actually done well, and they capped the zones at 5players right from the start.
---
Well this all changed with the 1.10 patch. They moved all instances down to 5man except for LBRS/UBRS which were reduced from 15 to 10. Then they overhauled the itemization in these zones, putting in many pieces of gear that at best make raid content easier, at worst trivialize raid gear. https://classicdb.ch/?item=22267 (Spellweaver's Turban) is probably the best example of such an item.
---
Now in historical context this was a good move. We'd been playing vanilla for over a year now and TBC was just around the corner. The new itemization helped raiders gear up their alts faster and helped those players late to the game progress through the raids faster. More people were able to see more vanilla raid content before TBC blew it all away thanks to the power of 1.10 gear.
---
HOWEVER back here in the land of Classic where many of us are concerned with how easy raid content might be due to 1.12 talents and combat mechanics in at launch, having access to 1.10 loot was a big concern. Blizzards acknowledgement of this by pushing off both the launch of Dire Maul and also moving the dungeon itemization revamp into it's own phase shows that they get this problem and are taking moves that both address the problem and respect the history of classic.
---
Indeed. It's extremely difficult to achieve, even with high pop servers.
---
That's what's said but honestly it isn't that hard as long as you aren't 12 and spend all your gold on a blue dagger that does 1 more dps every other level. 
---
KeEp yOur feeT oN tHe GroUnd!1!
---
Well, the salt is coming from somewhere
---
I disagree, I think it's going to be the slim majority that is progressing through content that quickly.
---
The game also isn't meant to be just non-stop linear progression. It should be timed to allow people to enjoy themselves. Players want to spend some time PvPing, trying different professions, trying different classes, etc.
---
I think Nost was just slightly faster than actual. Naxx was scheduled for 17 months after launch whereas I think it was 19 months in Vanilla. And even that felt a little cramped. I don't remember anyone complaining about a lack of content.
---
The only thing in the cash shop I don't want to see is WoW Tokens. I don't really give a shit if someone wants to buy a mount or a pet. 
---
No. The AH wil be linked from start.
---
They said it at Blizzcon.
---
MC is easy without DM.
---
Fuck that guy. Not a true vanilla player. 
---
Is there an app for this? 
---
I would absolutely love one! 
---
Oh hey, have a downvote :)
---
Dude you pay anyways. Idk if you remember correctly but the items needed to be collected depending on your server could be as much as an epic mount on top of having to do the crazy quests. I was so happy when I got mine back in the day though.
---
Oh wow looking at the MC loot it was even worse than I remembered, way way worse. And yeah we disenchanted several bloodfang hoods I remember, then it was massively buffed when they removed that dumb stun proc.
---
It will be a world of difference. Feral is probably the best Druid spec in 1.12 but it was pretty trash early on. No Ferocious Bite, no shifting out of Polymorph, much less armor on Bear Form. Granted, all classes were tweaked throughout Vanilla, but I think starting with 1.12 mechanics will have the biggest impact on Druids. Each individual change to Druids was not drastic on its own, but the end result is greater than the sum of their parts.
---
Yeah, I do agree but at the same time I'm not exactly sure what Blizz can do.
---
To me, the AQ war mats are the biggest issue but if you look at what those are, it's hard to imagine what Blizz would replace them with.
---
this. Ill need that time to get money for the warlock mount mats anyway
---
Does anybody know which class quests will be out on release? I heard that some warrior quests didn't come out until 1.8. Does that include the Whirlwind Axe quest, or will that be available right away? Just curious, because it will make a big difference for Warriors.
---
credit goes to u/Snelhest3 , he made a post about itemization a while ago and used Bonereaver's as the example.
---
Mainly AV is the one that serves the most people and also the easiest rep of the 3 to grind. If you're alliance side and get consistent queues, you can grind it out in one AV bonus weekend (though you *really* have to commit to finish in a weekend).
---
If you are by yourself then I think the only feasible way to rush LMW is to also take tailoring.
---
Tailoring will allow you to craft greens that can be disenchanted, but you will need to alter your leveling path so that you can grind humanoids for sufficient linen cloth.
---
But if you are not planning on keeping Enchanting, and if you are not trying to race ahead of the leveling zerg, then it may save time and money to buy these wands on the auction house instead.
---
I mean, Blizzard did say it was based on community feedback alongside their own deliberation.
---
Yep those are my only remaining concerns. Less so for sharding, I think they're well aware of how anti-Classic it is, so they'll do the right thing. 
---
Loot trading is beyond stupid though, and I'm at a loss as to why they are even considering adding it. It's a very significant later addition to WoW, and therefore has no place in Classic.
---
I was a young, elitist turd in early vanilla.
---
There was a Shaman in my group I was making fun of to my guildies because of his build/gear. Somehow, I accidentally sent it to him in a PM. His response was "I don't care man, I'm enjoying the game, maybe you should try doing the same instead of putting other people down." I expected him to get into a flame war and snap at me but that's all he said. At that moment I realized I was a little shit and felt immense shame and guilt for the numerous groupies and players I harassed for not living up to my standards.
---
It's so easy to be verbally destructive in these games. Everyone please realize it's just a game; if you're not having fun then stop playing or leave your group.
---
No chance in my opinion. They had a lot of servers back then. I'm thinking there will be substantially less servers this time around.
---
Just take this post, swap the words Alliance and Horde. And replace Hillsbrad and Stonetalon with Redridge and Duskwood. There's the other perspective. 
---
Launcher I can live without, but the music on the log in screen better be Classic.  
---
Because it’s obvious he’s trying to cash out on being a “vanilla content creator” when he actually knows nothing about vanilla.
---
For leveling warlock would be better. The VW can be an absolute godsend if you know how to use it right.
---
Could you imagine actually getting all this gear? 
---
Betas for retail have been invite only. But if they're doing a server stress test/sharding stress test or whatever, that might be open. I have no idea.
---
No paid time off? Feels bad :(
---
If you're properly chain pulling you should nearly always get use out of it, it's a great dps boost that costs 0 mana. Extra pet hp does literally nothing for you. The only time your pet dies is either when you run oom or you sacrifice it to get away, either way having more hp won't help.
---
Yes, he did.
---
Flat earth society 
---
if there are that many warriors they are going to become very frustrated because they are not going to be able to find groups.
---
no one wants to pug with a dps warrior and there's only one tank per group.
---
Yes, it will be a change, and they seems to try and deliver Classic with minimal changes.
---
But it will be a change that will have no impact on the game play, the lore, or whatever else. In fact, it will be BENEFICIAL for Classic to have different mats for AQ war effort....OR, keep the same mats, but UP the quantity dramatically. Or add new mats...
---
But, if they keep it was it was, I won't mind. Sure, the gates will be opened much sooner, but I can live with that:)
---
Do Warlock Shadow Mastery and Demonic Sacrifice % increase account for spell power? I read somewhere online that SM does not account for your spell power, but DS does. 
---
LOL, no. 
---
Which faction/race/class did you choose?  
---
Regarding the honor system. The best solution to avoid an unpleasant situation where hardcore players murder every player green to them is postponing the update for two or three weeks. People will still be able to pvp as much they want but the incentive to farm players for honor should be absent at the very beginning. Three weeks in those savages are lvl 60 and will conduct their business in the end game zones for maximum efficiency. And I'll see them there, but no need to push the update any further. 
---
You can want new content. I've written why it's both a bad idea and not likely to happen. If it doesn't affect Classic, good luck.
---
I am not a fan of Tips due to his stream of revealing "insider info" one little tidbit an hour while collecting donations the whole time. His loss of work, posts on the topic, and sudden dependence on content production to support himself seemed like a ploy of manipulation. I do care about the lives of content producers I enjoy but he came out of nowhere (at least for me) asking for support and crying the blues. Most of the content producers I support and follow hooked me with their content prior to gaining any financial support or pathos/empathy from me. 
---
After that all his big smiles super happy persona just seemed disingenuous and I found myself far more interested in Orcbit, Countdown to Classic, and MadSeasonShow. Just my 2 cents.     
---
16
---
As someone who plays bfa and pservers. There are plenty of us who will ditch retail to play classic if given the option. The player bases are not unique
---
Maybe even weeks would be great.
---
This is pretty much everything r/classic has been asking for. 5/5 for Blizzard
---
fucker.  
---
I just talk the ear off of my two friends who can not care less about WoW. I can't stop myself doing it though. It's like I'm hovering above my body watching myself talk to them about it and I can't get myself to stop.  
---
If Classic WoW comes out in Summer 2019 then you're OK with Naxx not coming out until Winter 2020?
---
Wake me when September 2020 ends.
---
that was one thing that kind of sucked as a hunter in vanilla. there were all these buffs / procs / racials / abilities that would only effect melee attack power, not ranged.
---
I was soo glad when they changed that all in TBC
---
Having more HP on top of extra armor is beastly. Your pet can safely tank multiple mobs in emergency situations and dies less frequently.
---
Even if you're chain pulling there's still typically travel time between mobs. I was never to see great benefit out of it.
---
I think loot trading and automatic reporting are bad, but ill deal with it. 
---
Lmao you're like "well that settles that" *pockets phone*  
---
very nice ty
---
Nips out baby!
---
Damn, that looks great.
---
lets run the reworks in REVERSE order this time!
---
You sound like me five years ago. I've since realized that everything mass-market is always getting worse. Appeal to China. Appeal to the extreme political left. Appeal to the marketers' studies and make it bland. Appeal to people's addictive tendencies. 
---
But never, ever do great work. That is a relic of the past. That this project appears to be coming along in an intelligent fashion shows that the deconstructionist mind virus hasn't infected this project somehow. 
---
But lose hope for the future of the retail version of WoW. That will never get better. Postmodernism is a religion.
---
SOME dungeon gear.
---
You still have to farm ALL raids to keep your gear as good as possible.
---
It's not like players will jump into Naxx with DM gear only.
---
Saved.
---
Honestly the original plan was such a shit idea. Classic would have still been enjoyable, but shit like Dire Maul on release was just unnecessary.
---
The only thing I'm wondering about is the pvp gear. I feel like they shouldn't wait too long to add it to the game. Maybe they could add the lower tier first and then the Grand Marshal/High Warlord stuff later on?
---
lol, that pool was actually the best place to fish.  I've got some screen caps somewhere of me and a dozen horde and alliance fishing with a war raging just above us on the ridge.
---
But Naxx sucks anyways. Naxx gear is just way too unbalanced and unfit for classic attributes. Breaks the game both damage and healing wise.
---
What don't you like about them? I'm considering maining a priest. I'm probably going to stick to shadow for the most part and just off heal when needed. I know PVE end game shadow is lacking but for PVP and questing I think it'll be alright. I'm probably going to make a more viable alt that can raid but idk. Might also just try to find a group that doesn't mind having a shadow priest who can off heal.
---
&gt; Maraudon
---
score
---
Nah mate I said dedicated, I got r10 working 9-5 Playing 5:30 till 1am Ez :D
---
If they don’t nerf gold farming like pservers do then it will be easier
---
ppl wlll be spam selling lesser magic wands on first day 
---
Command and Conquer's "I'm a Mechanical Man" was the better song though TBH. 
---
No, T 0.5 WILL be in game before Phase 5.
---
In Phase 5 you will get the NEWER T 0.5, which was added in 1.10.
---
LET PEOPLE TAKE THEIR TIME IN CLASSIC
---
You guys are gonna hate me, but I've been day dreaming my multiboxing setup.
---
My friend has settled on a warrior &amp; priest. In going shaman main, and 2 hunter cannons as DPS.
---
We should be able to 5 man most early game dungeons, and wipe the floor with Alliance in STV.
---
Pre-DM list. Easy enough.
---
I just don't like the lore behind the class. Never played a priest and I think I never will :)
---
I agree. If Blizzard is really watching, we need to cry out against Loot Trading and bite the bullet on sharding. It’s a temporary fix to a temporary problem that we will out level in 3 hours, loot trading is a permanent solution to a problem the community doesn’t think exists. 
---
True and true. I was worried about it at first. But all classes are going to be a little saturated at the start. 30+ I’m not to worried about other warrior tank competition. It will be there but so will multiple groups. Also the best part about playing on a closed off server(no xrealm) is that you can build a rep and ask people to add you if they liked your talent or whatever and spread the word in their guilds or to friends. Networking and skill will be a big part of classic. And this goes for all tanks, heals, and dps. Also I should point out dps and tank warriors might as well be two different classes. There similarity’s end at plate, str, and sta. 
---
&gt; (hard is hard, regardless of WHAT exactly makes it hard)
---
I obviously disagree. As of now, especially considering the itemization changes, it's just a matter of time, not skill, therefore everyone should be able to do everything at one point.  
---
It comes down to, enough gear for everyone that the healers don't run out of mana / tanks die in 1-shot.  
---
That doesn't mean that every raid will be pugged on the first week they get released, and that nobody will fail though.  
---
Basicly, it's artificially lengthening the progression time by distributing sub-optimal loot, instead of providing actual challenges and asking for some skill in playing your class (exceptions to the rule exist ofc.).  
---
Blasphemy
---
For sure.
---
Even on pservers at the end of their life, I see wayyyy more legendary weapons than I see rank 14 weapons. 
---
Hunters are utility dps. A lot of fights in ZG and a bunch of BWL trash is made 10x easier when you have a hunter just kiting stuff. The kite it to vaels room meme is legit.

#NoChanges

But in vanilla PvP is everywhere because you have to get out, even if you do not focus on PvP. I would definitely like to set a goal for a gear that I can use outdoors, and for the original schedule, R10 is a nice balance.
---
I certainly don't fancy walking outdoors in ... Transcendence set.
---
No. No. No. Poly and CS should be the other way around what is this amateur keybinding
---
If you're trying to level quickly via questing, especially if you're following the Alliance leveling guide, you won't spend too much time in Duskwood. For Plaguelands it might be beneficial to have, but it's by no means mandatory.
---
Maybe not. Since those servers are still around, they might want to avoid confusion from having people specify Stonemaul-US-BFA and Stonemaul-US-Classic ?
---
Yeah ZG buff persists through death so it's fantastic for progress raids. It not being there makes MC and BWL a tad more challenging.
---
Reducing the price violates the no changes policy.
---
Don't let your optimism outpace your caution. The gaming industry is rife with promising things that turn sour. Let's wait a bit before easing up on Blizzard's leash
---
Listen to the video. He spend a load of time basically saying that you can't mitigate crushing and that you have to have a shield block macro ready at all times. His whole argument is based of the premise that some bosses do not hit hard. Well I healed original classic and I have seen the joke that is the PS raids and they are no-one near right. The boss swing timer are wrong, the boss hit amount is wrong and the accumative effect of basic attacks crushing stacked with abilities will kill a tank before he uses a switch macro. This video is more PS bullshit and should be ignored.

I think the higher ups at Activision Blizzard realize this is a semi-niche product in the current gaming market and the costs associated with developing it are most likely very low. It probably has a very high profit margin due to the fact that they aren’t developing a new IP. Due to this they are probably telling the dev team “so long as you keep the costs low, do whatever it takes to get these players back on our subscription.” 
---
My guess is that it’s not a higher up *defending* the integrity of the game, but moreso one of those extremely rare occasions where profitability and success of the product is aligned with the desires of the consumer.
---
Yeah the caster gear in ZG is miles better than most MC loot. Crazy amount of upgrades and makes BWL a lot easier.
---
I agree and id be happy with this approach. Clearly the hardcore no changers dont want to even think about options other people want (even if it means leaving their untouched version separate).
---
Wow that HP is almost asking for one of the pirates to wander over and oneshot you and steal ur epic
---
That's fair criticism!  And if I'm being honest, the whole idea of a 10m video that digs in to a forum post seems odd to me, no matter who is posting it... I'd rather just read the forum post myself, I don't need someone else to interpret it for me.  But clearly there is a market for it, so who am I to judge?  It's easy enough to just not click on those and instead browse people's guides or lore videos or other fun content.
---
No changes
---
Its such a cool mount though. A big part was that if you knew what you were doing, the mount quests could be significantly cheaper than purchasing the racial mounts. 
---
Will this also entail classic graphics? If it does it’s a non starter for me sadly. 
---
I'm good with $15. I want them to understand that people are willing to pay a high price sub for a great game. Besides, that's how it was in the beginning. 
---
I'm sure some would enjoy paying their sub by farming the current expansion lol. I'm not gonna do it tho
---
Counterpoint - if consumables aren't being sold at a loss, then your profession beats out any surcharge, and you have a second option if you need them while prices are high. 
---
Yeah opportunity cost is a hugely overlooked issue, but there are some merits to crafting
---
There were so many inaccuracies in the demo version of classic that it's not really worth using info gleaned from it.
---
It should work like #1.
---
You're just over-complicating things. Guilds raids X days a week and they plan specific raids for each of those days. If things are on farm they just remove a day until more content comes out. It's reallly simple to plan for say 3 raid days a week. Do you really think it's that complicated from going to 3 BWL raids a week to 2 BWL raids and one ZG?
---
You know the answer or not? Stfu otherwise.
---
To be fair, retail arguably has more "activities available" than Vanilla. But of course it's not just about that.
---
What was the name of the evil dead things in the bottom of scholo? Like rissen constructs or something. I remember as a healer so many tanks yoloing that room before gear was any good.
---
That is Absolutely Insane. lol but seriously, I love that dude. He works his ass off and can be very insightful a times.
---
any serious pvper will either respec for raid or not raid until they are done ranking though
---
Burn them and the entire MoP to the ground
---

---
&gt; and your ridiculous crusade against Paladins are simply put, pointless.
---
So ironic you would say this because pointing out that SotC is currently not even deserving of being put on your hotkey bar is a crusade *for* expanding and fixing Paladins, and making all their abilities useful—as they were originally intended.
---
&gt; There are however plenty evidence to suggest that the seal is meant to trigger procs. Here's the 1.9 Patch Notes:
---
&gt; Seal of Righteousness - Now does holy damage on every swing. It can now proc correctly as well. The Judgement effect has been renamed "Judgement of Righteousness" to differentiate it from the Seal damage in the combat log.
---
You're misreading the patch note. Before 1.9 SoR proced its extra damage randomly on each weapon swing. It was changed to make the damage Holy—not just regular damage—and to make that Holy damage proc on every single swing.
---
It's not talking about procing other things, like weapon enchants or DPS trinket effects. It's talking about procing the Holy damage from each swing.
---
&gt; Lastly, the seal was changed in TBC to not proc, but that means absolutely nothing. Different expansion means lots of overhauls to every class and it's faulty logic to conclude that just because a particular change was made in patch X, it was supposed to be like this in previous patch Y.
---
Except the devs fully admitted that they pushed off many changes, tweaks, fixes, and adjustments over to [the big TBC patch](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-shaman/668634.htm)
---
&gt; “Right now the class team is heavily focused on the expansion. We will be announcing details of what's in store for each class in the weeks to come. There are a number of improvements we're considering for Shamans in expansion, such as improved totem UI and functionality. I've also been studying the development of new talents and abilities for each class, and so far I'm fairly excited at what I've seen for the Shaman. Despite the belief that no one reads the Shaman boards (ironically, our loudest forum), we're fully aware of the feedback that's been expressed here, and will do what we can to address it. **Much of the improvement players are demanding will have to wait until the Burning Crusade launches, which isn't too far off.**”
---
Care to elaborate why you level with mining, only to switch to herb later? Is it that much more profits while leveling?
---
I really want to go rogue as that was always my class in WoW, but I'm reading it's a bitch to get gear in the 40 man raids for rogues due to so much competition. Do you have any input on that?
---
It is awesome isnt it?
---
Uh, how do you understand that? I wish you were correct but, there is no mention of an "old" or a "new" T0.5 gear set. Can you elaborate?
---
$9 a month is stopping you from full blown hype? 
---
Taurens hp bonus doesn't really help in PvE, you already have healers. Unless you're dropping to less than 5% HP it really doesn't have any effect, it's essentially a dead racial 99% of the time you're raidng. Also almost every boss is immune to warstomp, so thats only really good for trash in dungeons or open world. 
---
I think Orcs are better forsure all around, Trolls have the best threat generation because of Beserking though if you want to focus on that
---
Shhhhhh

Tipsout video: BRAND NEW CLASSIC WOW UPDATES (Duration: 32:06)
---
They could do it the slower of the two options. Say 1.2 came out 5 months after 1.1 originally... in classic they could wait for someone to clear onyxia and molten core, THEN start a 5 month timer and have each progression be server specific.
---
That way it'd be potentially slower than vanilla, but never faster. That way, low pop servers never really get borked up with content releasing that no one's done.
---
Just an idea.
---
Because they dramatically changed item design philosophy from when the game released and made MC to the content they added later.  
---
Lets say you have a plate chest piece that's ilvl 64, so it's an epic that would drop from MC. With vanilla 1.0 WoW items, this might have some stamina on it, and then it would also have other completely random things like spirit, nature resistance, agility and some defense rating. What this means is if you found a blue that was only ilvl 60 but had the right stats on it, the blue would be a lot better.   
---
After the game came out, they realised putting items in that are harder to get that are often really bad due to useless stats doesn't feel that great - finally killing a boss after 6 weeks of trying with 40 people only to find out the loot is worse than a lvl 58 blue you got before you hit 60. So going forward they tended to make useful items with good stats for their level. MC and Dire Maul are the two main examples of this - technically MC is higher level, but in Dire Maul they actually tried to make good items, so they end up being better than most MC items.
---
And they did say their original 4 phases plan was a work in progress first take and would likely be subject to change.
---
It was always clear that they'll flash it out further down the road, but that didn't stop youtubers from making 200 panic videos about the horrible progression Activi$on-(Blizzard) would force down our throats. And now we're getting blessed by 200 euphoric "we did it reddit" videos about how community feedback saved the day. Oh jolly, what would we do without our diligent content creators.
---
To add on to that: if WoWWiki is right about only 1 person reaching rank 14 per realm per week, then a maximum of 52 people will get the Rank 14 gear over the course of one year. [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor\_system\_(pre-2.0)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0))
---
I would prefer to see the honor system along with blue PvP rewards get added early so that casuals can start grinding for the blue set (max Rank 10). That stuff won't break the game and some of the pieces are must-haves for hybrid classes, but it takes a very long time to get. On the other hand, I think AV rep rewards should come AFTER the honor system. AV rewards are really good and really easy to get.
---
Wow I feel personally attacked
---
This is a fucking game changer right here. 
---
It's been a while but I *think* it was Seinfeld?
---
Lol luckily not that I've seen so far 
---
Bruh imagine a world with no BGs, ever. World pvp only. The entire game is like STV. No one is safe.
---
PvP, farming and ehm... Dungeons? Would be nice to have a reason to go back there for an additional upgrade even after farming them before. Plus the quests are anazing.
---
hah! This is true :D
---
I really doubt it, though I would definitely be open to this change 
---
I think it's more due to conversion here in the Netherlands.
---
The original graphics are there
---
No changes!
---
hype truk just arrive
---
Me only paying 50% of it would rob me of my sense of pride and accomplishment
---
Full game - full sub. 
---
I will suck your dick if thats true. 
---
I never thought about it but you're right, because every other cave in the starting zones has aggressive mobs.
---
So what's your point?  They had to wait in retail Vanilla too.  What happened to  #NOCHANGES!!!!!
---
I was super excited about this, but given recent events with Act/Bliz I'm over it.
---
OMG this is so good... Crazy to see that much clicking though. I think even then I was at least using hotkeys (my buddy used to crush me at WC3 all the time, he used hotkeys there so I started doing that too, and that translated into using hotkeys in WoW too). 
---
I heard it was bad in Europe, but damn how bad is it?
---
What is the problem of them being super strong anyways? They require a crazy huge grind.
---
The proc rate is the big thing. Private servers tend to overstate proc rates by a large amount.
---
No salt. Just an observation that every asshole I know enjoys PVP, and that nobody I play / raid with in PVE is an asshole.
---
Find a good feral who knows how to tank. Just invite warriors to dps. No stress. Also it's easier to tell a noob druid how to tank than to teach a noob warrior.
---
I’m not saying any of this is a big deal — it is what it is. It’s just a matter of planning for it.
---
Bingo. TBC was my favorite for sure. Anything I found slightly wrong with classic TBC fixed. And wotlk, while great and I'd play it, isn't as good as TBC to me. I don't think this guy realizes that there's probably a population at every level of expansion (including wod) that wants wow to stop there haha. I'm looking forward to classic wows future and years down the road hoping to look forward to classic tbc.
---
Yeah sorry, 4 stacks = 80 cloth not 40!
---
o_0 
---
Talents and spells are a weird bag. They've been at their best and worst in parts for like..... the entirety of the game being around.
---
At this point I want them to cook up a sliight tweak based strongly off of an early patch (pre the prepatch before tbc).
---
Otherwise we're just going to bring back certain useless(underwhelming) specs. I'm hoping they strike a good balance between complete recreation of the game and also fixing certain old shitty specs.
---
Now let's just hope they won't go overboard with this and put T2 to drop in MC.
---
SJWs and TBC/Wrath/etc babies can only roll chars on that faction
---
I really don't mind finding pandas, but a whole continent of them? &amp; a neutral playable race? I'd prefer to find a city of them, hidden somewhere or something. Ya know? They could be a small neutral faction for an expansion.
---
The quest was not even in the game at first anyway so i don't think this changes much
---
I used Vista for like 5 years. The shadow on the window border is exactly how mine looked on Vista with a black theme. I don't think 7 has that. 
---
Tips just is a little more goofy so people see weakness and want to attack him methinks.  Tips makes good content tho
---
Depends. Shadow priest would probably only be useful much later due to locks getting their bloodvine set much later due to postponed ZG.
---
Oh man that sucks. I’m all up for playing classic again, but I can’t force myself to endure that visual downgrade... wish they’d have made it a classic remastered instead. 
---
The proc rate will be less for the 1.12 BRE for sure. Private server devs overestimated it for sure.

We haven't gotten any real info about the beta yet, but with a summer release this month is around the right timeframe for a typical blizzard beta (wow expansion betas are usually around 4 months). I know some people think there will be no beta or a short/promotional one, but after playing the (very unpolished) demo I would be really surprised if we don't get a "real" beta.
---
feel free to unsub and move on then... spreading negativity for the sole sake of being negative does nothing more than make everyone not want to be around you. 
---
That's a great suggestion. You better go email it to the marketing/finance/monetization managers at Blizzard that are all earning $170,000 + about how awesome your idea is and why didn't they think of that.
---
You're probably right, I haven't used either in a long time.
---
Note: The iron horde are still level 90. The players level cap also raises to 100, but there are no enemies in the game levels 64 and 89. You do get experience for killing level 90+ enemies but very little. Not to mention regular lvl 90 non elite enemies are like raid bosses.
---
Players beware: Ultimate WoW is here.
---
I have the old list to work from, shouldn't take too long.
---
NAXX IS OUT!
---
The direct answer is no.
---
The entire community just went ape shit over ACTUAL Classic news over the last week or so because of how little information is being put out. 
---
And you're asking of later expansions are in the news? Think about that for a moment.
---
There's also [a quest that references Mana Gems and Mages going OOM.](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=42455/alodis-gems) Ah, the good ol' days of swapping to a Spirit weapon for Evocation!
---
Is there any update on the server situation. As it stands now with their shard infrastructure they can't handle as many people in one area as they could back during vanilla.
---
Yeah, the conversation ended shortly after our trip to this sub
---
Yay now 0.5 will come out at a stage where it's literally useless, just like in vanilla! #nochanges
---
Usually the 20 man raids were just done on off nights by whoever was up for it. I believe my guild did have set 20 man raid nights, but they were much more casual in nature.
---
Even other private servers get this right. I'm really confused why Nost of all servers never fixed it.
---
People don't like seeing him as an advocate for classic because he isn't that knowledgable about the game. He has often showed that he has little understanding of the game as it where, thinking WotF dispels polymorph and just not knowing basic game mechanics (There is plenty more, this is just the one I remember. Look at the video with Monkeynews and you'll see many basic errors that you just don't make). That is the whole truth really. I don't care at all to be honest. 
---

I just want to 2H windfury some motherfuckers, is that going to be possible.

---
Scumbag. A real rank 14 waits for an even duel when they've finished.
---
&gt; you can build a rep and ask people to add you if they liked your skill/ability.
---
right, and everyone thinks that *they* are going to be that warrior on everyone's short list but the reality is that you are just as likely to be locked out by that process.
---
And guilds will be running with guild tanks, not pugging them.
---
No one gives a shit about dps. They are a dime a dozen and can be pugged easily.
---
I remember level 1 rogues with 100 % dodge was a thing, worked in duels against max levels outside Orgrimmar iirc. I would guess that translates into PvE as well, at least for the dodge.
---
Yea, I recall back in Vanilla our guild just did ZG on the weekends casually, but we were playing with al content out and we’re finishing MC at same time as we were starting BWL. 
---
I guess the question becomes if we do MC for a bit, then BWL comes out. Then we farm that for three months. Then ZG comes out. There won’t be much more of a need for BWL and we’ll have assumably a couple of months before AQ40, so ZG could be the prime content for a bit. 
---
Whatever though. I’m sure it’ll work out fine.

Oh I just thought they were going to release the same game again and just create an alt.
---
Druid tanks are good but there’s no real replacement for a good warrior tank. Great advice, although I’ve got my warrior tank planned out for the most part. Will be my second time. Went pretty hard in vanilla.

---
I was good enough at the trading market that I both could buy that new dagger ever other level AND buy an epic mount. Although to be fair, I financed the first mount mostly with mining.  For some reason our server had relative low number of miners at lvl 60 , I just kept finding tons of Rich thorium veins .  It was more in the second year that I discovered the business simulator that is wow
---
So, you've given up waiting? 
---
You aren't waiting for classic anymore? 
---
You're going to go and create your own classic WoW instead? 
---
You've decided to take up programming and game design and you're going to launch your own WoW classic so you no longer have to wait? 
---
You're going to market and advertise it to millions of other fans and get them to all play it instead? 
---
You're going to be sued by Blizzard-Activision and win in court? 
---
You're going to require them to shut down their clone of your WoW mmo? 
---
You're going to become a GM and dual wield Thunderfurys as an undead paladin?
---
WoW, you're crazy. So crazy it just might work.
---
You must be fun at parties.  
---
Oh wait, you're not invited. 
---
Yeah sure but I wasn't talking about the viability of SP in general - my point was simply that if OC was willing/able to play a SP with 1.12 items, progressive itemization alone shouldn't be enough to dissuade them or their guild. Of course the number of debuff slots available at launch will be by far the biggest factor, more important than anything related to progressive itemization.
---
Nobody ever circumnavigated Azeroth!
---
I used it for many years without realizing you could start the game from the wow.exe. When I installed it I got the launcher on my desktop so I just used that for years, lol. 
---
Still reckon it will be late august when classic is released. When does anything these days gets released on time or early. I hope its july but my gut feeling it will not. 
---
Found the SJW
---
If nothing changes, AV won't be out until phase 3. I wonder if they would ever consider putting it into phase 2?
---
I like how Un'goro is an actual crater, instead of a valley surrounded by mountains... like every zone in the game.
---
5% is HUGE in progession fights, litterly can be the difference between winning and loseing. Warstomp still generates threat even if the boss is immune to stuns. 
---
They should enable total pvp at the starting zones so everyone can literally fight over quest mobs and npcs. Even make the NPCs kill-able to.
---
As soon as you hit level 5, you unflag and can't join in the battle royal anymore, or do any quests in the first zone.
---
No, then you go to brill.
---
Even with 16, you still most likely won’t be able to
---
Raid as affliction. 
---
Most of us here killed KT and got tank 14 BEFORE Vanilla was even released.
---
Just go with a letter and alphabetic order to choose if they don't example. Say L and then u take the first server with L in the alphabetic order (so laughing skull if that is a realm taht exist etc)
---
if no one with L-A then u go L-B etc.
---
If a friend don't understand it u can pratice it with him here.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/status
---
This ofc is only if they don't release and this way no one "has to wait" so u all choose the same server.
---
lots of lvl 40 staves check  
---
bad tier 0.5 items  check  
---
Every tank with draconian deflector  check   
---
yes this is a true 'first time'  picture
---
You’re right. But this isn’t my first rodeo lol. Also I’m not trying to push server or world first. I’m just trying to join a good raiding guild and progressing.
---
Imagine putting your worth into what date a person started playing a video game...
---
And where in my post did I state this was a bad thing? It's just a post mentioning it for the people who didn't maybe realize the implications of the change of timeline that blizzard introduced today.
---
If you play a class with a ton of utility, you can get by with Alchemy in pvp. If you BG grind pvp more than open world pvp, alchemy can be fine in pvp as well.
---
I’ve heard multiple wow “enthusiasts” day that they think Blizz will announce a release date by the end of the month at PAX East. 
---
They definitely will, I just hope they give us more than a few days.
---
This is something that works for me: when I speed level at the launch of a fresh server I always grab skinning and another gathering profession (mining/herba) that will support the main profession I will do after dropping skinning. 
---
Personally, i don' t like engie + alchemy combo, I just wanted to help OP with his request.
---
As some big braner said in the comments it might not be worth your time to gather all the mats by yourself. Sometimes it' s more efficent to go farm the best gold per hr your class allow you to do and snipe mats in ah.
---
Another important thing (that somone said) is that if you' re aiming to get to rank 10+ as fast as possible you should be grinding herba while queing bgs. Herba + killing ppl from the other faction is one of the best things you can do to get a lot of honor and farm golds at the same time.
---
Thanks for berating me. 
---
where the heck did you 'see' it set for 2021. its coming summer of this year. could be early-mid summer or towards the end but seems very solidly set for summer.
---
Hi, /u/Flippynipps
---
That’s like $2 lmao
---
Not to mention how does this affect quest rewards?
---
Will they update their item values as you go, or will you lose out on certain items entirely? 
---
I wonder which, if any, quest rewards changed the most with 1.10
---
This means classes will start pre-rework, right? I think I just reckoning bombed in my pants

At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many.

Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.

**What we expect from our members:**

At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, **we may also try to vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**Raid Schedule**:
---
Wednesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 - 24:00 **CET**

(With Monday as an additional day for progression nights)

I disagree with most other commenters. I think guild banks are quite likely to appear.
---
This is simply because without guild banks, people will share accounts. Shared accounts means stolen accounts. Stolen accounts create very expensive customer support incidents.
---
We see from loot sharing how much minimizing CS incidents matters to Blizzard. There is no question in my mind that Blizzard will offer some solution to this problem.
---
I already requested leave for next week
---
Maybe I'm remembering this incorrectly, but I think the mount training in vanilla actually cost a lot less - the major expense was the mount itself.
---
Like 10g for the standard training, 80 for the mount.
---
100g for epic training, 800 for the mount.
---
I seem to remember really struggling to make a decision on which one to get, because I knew I'd only ever be able to afford one mount. 
---
So with the whole classic thing,   Does classic mean from a graphics point of veiw its going to 1:1 mimic the original, or is it going to be equivalent of warcraft 3 HD....  same game that came out \_\_\_\_ years ago, but graphics are more inline with modern?
---
I wish BG's would exist...just not reward anything. No gear, no honor, no nothing.Simply exists for PRACTICING and IMPROVE a player's PvP skill.
---
Now that would be something.
---
Easy solution. Play, content drags on too long and gets stale, unsub, next content released, resub play again, repeat.
---
Fuck all haters bro! We love you and classic comes in the way we want that‘s all what matters!
---
It's understandable that people want to hold him accountable for those kinds of mistakes.  And it's understandable that people don't really like 10:30 long videos that simply read blue posts back to us (like this one).  Those things definitely come across as disingenuous.
---
But then there are lore videos, and dungeon walkthroughs, and interviews.  Quality content that I believe he's shown an enthusiasm and consistency in producing.  How many content creators push out 2 or 3 vids and then fall off the radar?  Tips has done enough that I feel confident he isn't going to just vanish one day, and he remains childishly excited about Classic as many of us are.  Maybe he's made a mistake, and maybe he puts out some questionable 10:01-long fluff videos (who doesn't at this point?), but I believe he's genuinely enthusiastic about the game and I appreciate a good chunk of his content.
---
It just boggles my mind how people can act the way they do about him, but then upvote this video to the top of the sub when it's nothing more than an 11-minute recap of something we all *just* read.
---
  eviscerated   for using the default ui ?
---
This is amazing news! Hoping they allow as much time as possible between phases, Classic Wow allows for it 
---
Welcome back Blizzard.
---
They should release TBC with updated graphics. That would be awesome. They have a lot of content from Legion.
---
It is, little gnome, it is.
---
dont let the door hit you on your way out.
---
What about phat in RS?
---
thats kinda awesome
---
...Graham?
---
so from what i read at the end it said ´´stages 2-6 are not determend yet´´ which in my eyes mean that the now know on the development team which month the game will release.
---
So do I! =D
---
tbh I didn't realize how many views this was gonna get I should've put an ad every 2 minutes just for you lol
---
They were 'pandering' to their Chinese market
---
oh look a pompous asshole
---
But why would they? Changing the AQ Questline would not fit with any of the other reasonings they have used to add in changes to Classic.
---
there was only rank 13 before i started playing
---
And I will watch the whole goddamn thing.
---
I guess, if your guild is juuuust scraping by and coming within milimeters of wiping then it's helpful. 
---
But for the most part, like 99% of your pve playtime it won't really do anything, unless you have bad healers.
---
I actually didn't know that immuned warstomp still causes threat. Do you know how much?
---
I wonder if it's even worth the cast time when you could use that time to generate more rage for demo / battle shout 
---
I never bought into the idea that DM items will break the early raiding experience. But delaying all the DM gold-farming by months will be massive for everyone who is behind the curve. The inflation from dungeon-farming methods can make things that much harder for people taking the game slow, so this is terrific news! (And fingers crossed they even do something to prevent the pserver gold farming strats when DM does release...)
---
Come on man, not everyone with an opinion like this is trolling. 
---
Some of them are just retarded.
---
#2 or #3?
---
This is really awesome, is it possible to buy this map?
---
Agreed. Hunters are already at the bottom of the dps meters in late game, but having BoM and Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer affect ranged attack power would greatly help. I'm sure there are other effects I'm forgetting atm. At least hunters on the horde side get ap through grace of air totem, although that will probably be used for WF or tranquil air totem most of the time.
---
They would've fucked up if it wasn't for the neckbeards who understand how the game needs to be released. Oy vey you guys are the worst subreddit
---
Someone made a troll thread on the Blizz forums about a summer 2021 release of the "full product" because that's when all the content phases may be out. OP likely saw that.
---
Thats just it. When the game came out we all started at level 1, didn't really know what content there was, nor did we know how it'd affect the endgame, what the endgame even was, etc. It took months and months for most of us to even get to 60, then we just winged it all from there.
---
Now we have this top-down view that skews it all.
---
Ya I really hope classic is a huge success and they keep the ball rolling into TBC. Maybe have a season reset for vanilla but also shift main dev team to TBC since vanilla wow classic will be rock solid by then.
---
No, you said it was complicated when it's not. Tt's really really easy and straight-forward.
---
its actually better to get a normal mount. can still mount when oom or silenced, also means you dont need 10sec to mount up with curse of tongues on you.
---
I dunno, but I hope there is one named ILLIDAN!!!!
---
I peed giggling. 
---
Actually it works like Swifthistle and is looted with other herbs in the same node. So of you find a Dreamfoil it can have a black lotus too.
---
My dad worked at Blizzard and I was the first ever beta tester, [Malbourn](http://i58.tinypic.com/11ieo7o.png) was actually my toon.
---
Exactly a medium duration of 5 months (4,5 or 6) would be GREAT for 80%+ of the player base.
---
The nutcase hardcore players (I am one of them) will get most if not all their wish list gear not before 3 months. It's simple math : 10 MC bosses x 2 drops per boss x 12 weeks = 240 items for a raid of 40 people, which means (in perfect conditions) 6 pieces of gear upgrades per raider. Add in Ony with another 40-50 item drops in 12 weeks, and you get another 2 gear upgrades.
---
Which is a total of 8 item upgrades from MC and Ony...IN THREE MONTHS of farming, with perfect loot distribution. Most TOP guilds will STILL farm MC for gear before BWL...but they will be ready for BWL.
---
The REST of the guilds (80% of the player base) will STILL gear up in MC two months AFTER BWL is released, because they leveled much slower and progressed much slower compared to top guilds.
---
4-6 months per phase would be absolutely PERFECT...for EVERYONE.
---
lol. True true.
---
We are a desperate lot aren't we?
---
That's default ui on an old resolution, you cant blame the guy
---
What if they re-tuned ZG to either a.) be harder so you need to run bwl first, but only need 20 people to run ZG or b.) make the items less good so it helps everyone get as far as bwl faster, and move onto AQ when the time comes.
---
Even in Joana's speed runs it still took like 2 hr 45 min to get to level 10. Granted that was with a hunter so not the strongest 1-10 class, but definitely not the slowest either. 
---
Benediction priest check 
---
It was swapped during vanilla. On launch the mount was expensive, then they swapped the costs so people could purchase multiple mounts. Whoever bought training but not their mount before the change got extremely lucky and could've had an epic mount for 200g with training.
---
It's almost certain that the riding will be the expensive part from launch this time around.
---
Yo, esfand! I’m excited about the news! And bro, just go make your content and make your money. If you didn’t make some sort of a living from it then you wouldn’t be able to make any content st all. Those of us that have brains appreciate it and don’t mind supporting you monetarily in any way! P.S. bro! I sent you a pm in discord a long time ago and you never replied!
---
That mount is basically already yours! 
---
Just the keybinds I should have said, I actually don't mind the default UI.
---
But now, unless you want to wait 4 months for the quest to open, you're now paying 1K for epic mount, and then 600-800g for the class mount.
---
Because our only aoe that does good damage is Multi-Shot and its on a 10 second cooldown. Great raiding hunters will also carry enginner bombs for aoe parts, which I never did in retail but I will when Classis is out to maximize my dps. 
---
The biggest issue is that mining and herb almost never keep up with your level. You'll still only be able to get copper when you start to see tin etc unless you spend time just leveling mining 
---
Yea, pretty much just subtract out the loot that is from DM.
---
What does the Tier 0.5 stuff entail - are these the quests to update the dungeon sets?
---
You failed at math.
---
MC (Phase 1) will last 4-6 months.Not 10.
---
Out of curiosity, what are people hoping/expecting for after all these phases from Vanilla WoW are in the game?
---
I hope they only allow a day's notice. I don't want to end up on some hufflepuff-ass server because I didn't see a massive community post saying all the fun is to be had on Illidan
---
&gt; hufflepuff ass-server
---
^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)
---
Azgalor. Be there or be square!
---
Again, it is NOT 10 months. Its 4-6 months. And it's not only MC. Its Ony also. And A LOT of 5 men dungeons. And UBRS.
---
You're right that success is aligned with the desires of the customer but companies often miss that point in the effort to ultra max monetize. The MMO space, specifically, has seen most games sacrifice the integrity of the product in favor of appealing to whales. 
---
I'm sure those guys have been at the meetings about this game. Classic would need to be defended from these greed drones with their charts and graphs and brilliant ideas about how to extract maximum value from the users. So while you're right that it makes sense to protect the project, I think that somebody with political power within the corporation is making that point against what might be a tempting value proposition pitched in the meetings.
---
It will be when I'm the Cocaine King of Classic shuffling enchanting dusts and getting my bank alt drunk on the mailbox. 
---
I'll take the over on this bet 
---
I really hope BGs are released early on... It is nice to take a break from the grind and enlist in a few BGs. If they wait until later to release them, I guess I'll be waiting even longer to play  :(. As for the rest: couldn't care less, end game is horrendously dull to me.
---
Yeah, it was pretty rare to get GoA tbh. 
---
One that I notice right away is Bloodfury, the Orc racial. I always play Orc hunter so losing the ranged AP from Bloodfury really sucks. 
---
Good. 500 posts about DM on release and ZG with BWL, and now we have those separated.
---
500 more posts about loot trading, right click report, and so on, and we might see even more progress.
---
I like default UI, its clean and simple. Just gotta add those keybinds tho
---
Mother of God, they're listening. This reminded me of reading a private server launch schedule. Okay Blizz, you win. I'm finally excited for Classic Wow. You've earned the hype. I never ever thought I work say this again, but well done Blizzard!!
---
I think you will see a lot of warriors drop off before that in the 10-15 lvl range. With no real aoe or cc the death rate while leveling can be terrible if you are running solo.
---
This is awesome news!
---
As an aside- I have not been following this news super closely, and I was wondering what they plan to do when Classic WoW has been fully released? This isn't criticism or anything, I'm just curious-
---
 Like, after all 6 phases are out for a year or so, where does everything go from there? Do we just hit that point, and then wait for everyone to get bored of the game as the playerbase slowly dwindles down?
---
I hope the pvp patch/gear is added between 1 and 2, or at the least at the beginning of phase 2.
---
I think that phase ended when the community petition was signed with overwhelming support and Blizzard finally agreed to give fans what they wanted in lieu of making a cash cow, slot machine, filthy casual paradise. They have their mainstay product for that, so they don’t need to abuse the one that has the sole intent of recapturing their estranged hardcore playerbase
---
Breaking News : Classic Team is PART of Blizzard.
---
You can't love them without loving Blizzard in the same time.
---
Depends. Too much time and people will lose interest. I don't want to farm BWL for 6 months, only to get marginal upgrades and enchants for the NEXT 6 months from ZG.
---
While most people wouldn’t mind down the road seeing a tbc or wrath server.. I’m gonna have to ask y’all to chill the fuck out with that talk. We’re mere months away from getting the server we cried about for year(s) - and we’re getting it. We’re getting it from a crew that is attempting to [realistically] emulate the experience we all nostalgically crave. 
---
All this talk ALREADY of “well what about TBC and Wrath they were better than classic” shit needs to chill. We’re given an inch and y’all want a mile.
---
Sit on your hands till they’re numb and jerk yourselfs off while enjoying classic and chill the fuck out.
---
I think increasing the sub to $20.45 would actually be in [keeping with the spirit of Vanilla](https://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=15&amp;year=2004)
---
IS NOT FOR YOU
---
$2.50 to unlock the classic theme for the client atleast 
---
Jk but I wish they did have themes
---
Well, if they did change it, it would be for the reason I said above.
---
Im not saying I think they would or should, but I can see the logic behind it. 
---
Really doubtful - most people who wanted progressive item stats wouldn't want that. They would say R10 is too good and makes many BWL gear redundant.
---
Tbh being the only person who is waiting for Classic is a lonely existence. None of my friends or co-workers are anticipating it.  
---
Of course barely any of my co-workers even play games.  
---
Well it still lives on to today with the servers using the Nost code, aka ND.
---
It'll be cheaper mount, expensive riding skill. No point in going back, that change was made when they realized people want to have multiple mounts.
---
Pally and Lock epic mount quests are out until phase 2.
---
They recreated those based on guesses and some logs. It won't be 100% authentic, they even tell you that in the post lol. Did you even bother to read it?
---
Holllly shit that hits home hard 
---
Dunno if it means anything but MoP was a better expansion than Cata, WoD, Legion and BfA.
---
Who knows, but I think you're right.
---
The question left intentionally unanswered is whether they will update items as content is released or leave items at their 1.12 state if they were updated.
---
Two types of dungeon items:
---
1) Not released until a later patch but very potent.   According to this post they won’t be released until 0.5.  This is a good thing. Example:  spellweaver turban
---
2) In at release but buffed at a later patch.  These items are not addressed or ambiguously addressed in this.  I’m inclined to believe they will be released in their buffed state because it seems like Blizzard is intentionally avoiding having items change through the game cycle (like PvP year).  Example: luminary kilt
---
Honestly I think they are right to avoid changing item stats/effects over time because it is extremely confusing to players (especially those not experienced in classic).  It also makes certain classes roll for items that aren’t good for them now but will be good when it changes eventually.  I can’t say with certainty that this is what they are doing, but it is a thoughtful approach if they are.
---
You dont have to be a naxx tier raider to think a max lvl 38 vanilla player shouldn't be a speaker for the community.
---
People generally dont like when others pass themselves off as an authority on things when theyre not, regardless of subject. 
---
Personally i respect his immense hustle and the fact that he has more subs than Esfand is a testament to that work ethic, but still doesn't change that hes a bit of a poser tbh.
---
&gt;just to enable a tank to dual-wield instead of sword-and-board
---
To reiterate, Fury tank means more threat which means more dps which means faster clears. Saying it's "just for the tank to duel-wield" minimizes the massive impact it has on the entire raid.
---
My only complaint is this kinda means I'll likely never get my pally quest mount.
---
Everything else is great, but I don't want to spend 600+ gold on the quest a few months after already spending 1,000g on epic mount (or going months without an epic mount)
---
They didn't say anything about changing the actual itemization of gear.  
---
They only spoke of where and when gear drops.  
---
Even without Blizzard's help, there's very strong historical evidence of this data. Considering the databasing effort that took place in vanilla which is still accessible today.  
---
If I'm wrong, I'll definitely buy the training when it's cheap then wait for the change and get mount+skill for 160-200g
---
I loved classic wow but does anyone know if they are going to keep the current group finder for instances? Finding groups in the past was a pain in the ass sometimes.
---
they're....not gonna fuck it up!!!!!
---
Agreed
---
Definitely playing a druid. We have a core of friends that are coming back for Classic, I played a druid back in the day, and doing so now will allow me to switch between tank and healing roles as needed for group runs.
---
Ahh the famous classic community feeling :) so great!!
---
A simple /s would have done it.
---
Yes they have full access to a working version of the old game. They can see the math behind the mechanics. This is old news.
---
They obviously opted to convert the game to a newer engine due to the modern development and hosting tools offered.
---
The game is based in 1.12 class mechanics. Item progression is confirmed to match content however (even private servers varied on this). The game is being built to be a near stand alone game requiring minimal maintenance for very logical reasons. 
---
It's an emulation. It could only ever be an emulation. Difference will occur, but we are getting something far more familiar to private servers (without dynamic spawn rates) because of the practicality it.
---
Oh look a social content cock sucker.  How much Esfand paying you to shill for him?
---
You'll have to wait for a while then because they swapped them around in patch 1.12 ;)
---
Seconded. I plan to level a Warrior (along with rested exp alts) as this was my main in the latter half of Vanilla, with the intention of tanking, or at worst off-tanking in a raid environment, but I'd much rather dps dungeons and let a Feral Druid tank, knowing that I can still sword/board at any time if things go south.
---
Found a great classic community member - oh it was actually a toxic one
---
First the possibility of Halo MCC PC being announced tomorrow, now this? 
---
*boner intensifies*
---
Good choice, very viable. I have to disagree with dps being a dime a dozen. Having a dps core that gets along, takes failure well, supports each other, and can alternate roles on a fuckup is a very beautiful thing. Takes time to reach that zenith though. 
---
I'm just glad classic hasn't been scrapped as a cost-saving measure... this is just a bonus.
---
Yo set up a site and sell this as merch. People would so buy
---
Parent go broke from their kids playing cash shop mobile games.
---
Classic will be a money saver for them.
---
If this would be Lineage 2 subreddit this post would look completely normal. 
---
FYI ppl taking holidays from work on these kind releases to make good head start 
---
&gt; you can prob get one at a decent price
---
decent price being 'literally all your silver' - that'll be like 10s, but still :P
---
I don't have an opinion either way on guild banks, but so far with their release plan and double checking certain demo "bugs" were actually working as intended in 1.12, it's unlikely that guild banks will be added.
---
But with a general move away from customer service it could just be a security/customer service issue they want to minimize entirely. I mean I guess it's possible. They haven't confirmed no guild banks (as far as I know) but that doesn't necessarily mean it's on the table.
---
I don't care that much about raids except maybe ZG when it comes out so I'm fine I guess. It would just be fine to start with 16 slots. It's not just the Lock as you most surely now. Basically every class is afflicted by that. 
---
Hit 60 as warlock on K3 really fast. Would prefer it this way tbh. The epic mount quest chain is heaps flavourful, but getting 800g isn't that hard. Going to have to brush off on what I need to do to hit Exalted for the kodo though...

We're recruiting!  Despite the 'casual' title - we're a competitive bunch and love to win at all things, only held back from dominating in the online arena by wives/jobs/babies. Come and join this epic nostalgia trip and have a laugh while doing it, on a not-so-hardcore schedule.
---
What will WoW life be like as a member of Bearly Legal? - it's a bit TBD but we can tell you: 
---
* We're starting to discuss launch plans so alot is still TBD.
---
* At launch some of our members will likely go a bit ham - taking time off to go balls deep into it (not mandatory!).
---
* We're avid PvPers and PvPed a lot back in Classic, often leading arenas and topping honor boards.
---
* In terms of raiding, we know that we will raid, we just don't know how much right now (perhaps once a week).

Lucky for me I didn't watch it. I clicked, saw it was just a little over 10 minutes and downvoted.

Why would I need to watch you regurgitate an article?  Am I blind? Did I somehow forget to read in the last 24 hours?  It's fine if you want to be a social media content creator, but these "re-hash" videos are so fucking annoying.

Hell, someone else made a joke in the official content thread about how "everyone, watch out going to be a dozen videos repeating the same thing this post says!"
---
Not even going to read, suck me
---
Crendor would like to have a word with you
---
What a pitiful and lazy excuse. Nostalrius was able to mimic the old itemization with a relatively good degree of accuracy. All of the research has already been done for them. This is simply laziness on the developers. Community members would literally volunteer to dig through wayback machine web archives if they would let them but they won't because they don't care about putting the extra effort in.
---
The "sky is falling" swtor players were some of the worst about it lol. "This is it! This is the end! swtor is dying! Flee while you can, FLEEEEE!" It was like every other forum thread. Oh, but every other MMO also sucked so there was nowhere to go. Doom and gloom lol

In Wrath, I multibox'd 5 accounts. I was paying $75 a month to control all 5. I was making far far less money then, than I am now.  
---
The amount of characters I could control with your new sub for the same total cost is 12 or 13.  
---
I promise you don't want it.  
---
I had a self-rule in Wrath that I would never use my boxes to PVP (5 box shaman, etc) and I never did. Someone else who has the same ideas might not have the same self rules.  
---
Imagine getting upset at a harmless, fun-poking comment
---
That's great. Fun thing in Classic is that you can do whatever you like. And some specs are just not meant to do raids. 
---
they have a 1.12 version of the game, but now they claim to know exactly what was in the game in 1.2
---
Imo, the honor system should launch in p1. Let's get an incentive system for works pvp immediately, then bg's later. 
---
Well he did post it as a template on purpose...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/SrGrafo/comments/aw6mh3/meme_challenge_5_billy_wait
---
No, we're still getting 1.12
---
I won't celebrate until we know the full extent of sharding, until I know it wont go past level 10, I will stay stoic. 
---
Good players are good no matter what role they play.
---
My reasoning is that a group can succeed with a mediocre dps player, but will struggle with a mediocre tank or healer. This is why so many players talk about leveling with friends as tank-healer combos because forming groups will be so easy.  "LF3M dps" fills a LOT faster than "LF2M tank healer"
---
Hopefully we can at least start the quest up to needing DM, time will tell. Who knows how long phase one is as well, could only be a couple of months or so and not affect most people.
---
Child, I’m not your ‘Son’. I’m not even male. I am glad there will be EU and a NA servers though, 30 mystery meat says this twunt is gonna have everyone enthralled on the NA Server...

I hope you are trolling if you not you are a friggin‘ huge moron. It is insane how much anger shits like you triggering in me.

MC is easy without gear also.
---

---
MC is EASIER with DM.
---
PvP items shouldn't be that much better in pve than pve items themself
---
No I mean like the honor system, like when it was patched in at 1.4 (April, 05). Not the "pvp rework" patch where ilvls got upgraded and the 60 blue sets were adedd, that happened much later.
---
True and I’m actually having a buddy lvl  priest heals lmao 
---
That was the answer I was expecting :( Thanks for the super quick reply.
---
Yeah all you could do is randomize it between the factions. Otherwise it covers most things so there isn't a lot they could swap to.
---
I think "finally" is uncalled for here. Using finally indicates they chose not to listen to us at all. While they've been saying from the start this is a community effort and they're taking feedback on everything, which they have shown to do before this announcement as well.
---
I actually lol'd like a tard just now.  
---
T :o X I C
---
I hate this fat fuckn idiot 
---
As someone who didn't have a problem with the original release plan, I'm actually really glad to see these changes made. It's an improvement over the original plan and should make classic even more fun and true to the spirit of things.
---
(Note: When I say "didn't have a problem with the original plan," I'm not saying I thought the original plan was perfect)
---
Yeah, same as it was in vanilla. You have choices, you can grab that epic mount now or wait until you get the quest one. 
---
Stay tuned though because we have got 2 updates one right after the other. Seems like they are more forthcoming since we’re getting closer.
---
I want to be happy but they still have NOT confirmed proper item stats. If you launch with dungeon blues at the 1.12 values they will still be better then MC and diremaul drops. What's the point of delaying diremaul if you're gonna launch with 5 man dungeon items already on par with MC epics.
---
Someone should setup a VM image with Windows XP, a 1 GHz single core CPU, 1 GB of RAM, and 128 MB of VRAM for the full experience.
---
I remember when WoW was first revealed, and they made comparisons to previous MMOs. They very specifically said that part of the pitch is your character is a real adventurer right from the start, there will be no grinding rats in a sewer or any of that crap, you'll get right out there and fight bandits and bears and stuff. 
---
Meaningful activities is a better way to say it. You're right in an objective sense but I never really enjoyed the dailies type stuff.
---
I have a story to explain what I mean: In 2005 a Warlock chased my Mage around Silithus for 15 minutes. I had no chance in a 1v1 and we both knew it. I still think about it and when I wonder what compelled him to chase me like that I come around to two things that Vanilla had that retail does not: permanence and minimal hand of the developer. That is, we both had a sense of really being there in a world, prideful of our survival and character identity. And neither of us felt like we were wasting our time, because there was nothing "better" or more profitable to do. 
---
Just something small like that killed 15 minutes. And eventually he /surrendered and I got the hint and stopped running. We then spent 10 minutes shooting the shit through /emotes, and I'm pretty sure he was laughing as hard as I was in real life. So that's 30 minutes of activities that gained me nothing in game but was much more rewarding than dailies and that's the sandbox stuff I was thinking about. 
---
And then of course there is all the farming and exploring and wall jumping and dungeons and farming Twilight texts and 100 other things that players can choose to use their time on. 
---
Cool! Haven't been watching the news that closely. Can't wait!
---
Must have remembered wrong, was only a kid when I got it during vanilla.  :)
---
If they go the same route as OSRS, I will love Blizzard again
---
Just looked it up, you're right, it was 1.12. I do remember it being much earlier, like around the honor release... But I was never able to afford it so I'm not surprised that I don't remember it correctly
---
No Charges!
---
Maybe. But there will be plenty enchanters making them so the price will be decent i think. Thats why i think ill skip it. 
---
Same with tailoring, 99% of the stuff wont give you decent enough profit, or you end up trying to vendor those blue boots forever to get your moneys worth out of them. Easier to sell the silk on the AH or if you want it for yourself, just get the mats and find a tailor, they will love the skillpoint. When you just want to powerlevel it is much easier and you end up wasting a lot less mats.
---
By the time you get your truefaith and 4 mooncloth bags you will have spent at least 28 days of cooldowns to make all the mooncloth, so you should be pretty good on money by then and AH prices start dropping, while still having enough people on low levels to have good and cheap supply on the AH for the bars and stones you will need. So basicly you wont be on that fresh of a server anymore, most likely it will be at least 2 months old before your ready to drop tailoring. Herb is good especially if you can cash in on the first lotusses before everyone and their mother is after them.
---
Use your guildies for crafting the potions, they will love the skillups and you get all the potions you can hope for, crafting them (and acquiring the recipes) is a pain in the ass. Still not nearly as bad as trying to do enchanting.
---
Realisticly so few people would get them anyways so it shouldn't really be that much of an issue. Also for classes like Druid, Paladin or even Priest they really offer much needed gearing options.
---
BLACKROCK IS FULL
---
Short answer, 1.10 added a lot of catch up gear and fixed itemization on a lot of gear. Which made MC in full blues almost easier than MC in half epics before 1.10.
---
People who don't know about Vanilla really need to let this sink in:
---
There will be more Thunderfurys, Hand of Rags, and full T3 ret paladins than there will be Rank 14 weapons.
---
Ooh I really wish it would imply of an early summer release. But a wise man once said, you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.
---
Couldn't agree more.  it's fine if people want to genuinely make content videos, but this bullshit of re-reading a blue post back to us (at just over 10 minutes too) or the "WE DID IT ALLCAPS!" videos that just reek immensely of being socially unaware and narcissistic. (Which is ironic considering that the "social media content creators" are often the ones who don't have the slightest clue on how to act socially in the first place.) 
---
Now...
---
Does this mean we'll also get the old mounts for the first phase? I wasn't planning on hitting 60 fast, but if that's the case...
---
You must be a blond chic then because this post is clearly just to get attention.
---
Not until mid-Wrath.
---
fewer internet topics on the subject of distaste for the proposed design of the video game* ahem
---
Go to the classic forums.
---
You know, its kind of neat to see everyone in 'adventurer' gear in there.  Im a bit worried that im going to miss all my fancy transmog on Classic (I play a warlock, so im spoiled with a lot of really awesome tier sets), but seeing screenshots like this really is amazing.
---
Im not even 100% sure why.  Its kind of neat that it sets the '40 people with low power taking on immensely powerful beings' thing, but im not really sure thats why it looks awesome, tbh.
---
It just looks 'right' for some reason.
---
Oh noes! Someone with an opposing opinion!  I better either call them a troll, or insult them!  That'll show them the error of their ways!
---
Then again, not surprised at someone with the u/ handle of "Dick Surgeon".  Not exactly someone who goes after anything but low brow shitposts eh?
---
Best guilds have most of their dps players at least r13 so it definitely is not just a few people. 
---
Have you not played in private servers?
---
Most of the reason to use UI add-ons back in the day was to clean up the default UI because of how much space it wasted.
---
Shit's ugly af.
---
I Hear ya., why do you think I am on here? Good way to pass the time. and there are groups recruiting already on [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azrefd/looking\_for\_group\_monday\_march\_11\_2019/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azrefd/looking_for_group_monday_march_11_2019/) 
---
They have mentioned before they can look up spell ID’s and Item ID’s and compare the number to the date it was entered. Using that they can get exact times things were added. It won’t  be the correct itemization if 1.2 but it will be the correct item.
---
I really think the A needs to have consistent pronunciation. I like Shah-monn.
---
It will cost 150usd/year or so to play this 14y old Vanilla emulation with sharding and Loot Trading. Is it worth that? Maybe, we will see...
---
Amazing screenshot!
---
Upset?
---
I've already lost a great deal of interest on this day. If ZG/BWL is not in by month 3, and Naxx by month 5, then I won't even sub.
---
Bookmarked. Thanks!
---
Too bad you dont like it. I always found it nice with the eagles and all. 
---
If all you do is work, wow, and sleep then you are living the \#nolife
---
If by "certain" you mean "literally every" then yes.  
---
Good.  
---
&gt; But in vanilla PvP is everywhere because you have to get out, even if you do not focus on PvP.
---
Is it tho? I had 0 PVP kills and 0 PVP deaths until TBC.
---
Two pieces T0.5 is BiS for rogue.
---
Man, I feel like some kind of Classic WOW hipster saying it, but an influencer being in it for the money, let alone as a career, totally ruins a channel/content for me. I really enjoy videos that people make for the hell of it, or for their love of the game. But knowing they're making it to crank ad revenue, increase viewer engagement, direct people to a Patreon, or similar things just makes it completely undesirable. And of the influencers for Classic I've watched, Tips is definitely the most blatant in his dependence on viewer investment to keep going.      
---
          
---
To that end, even Esfand has soured for me recently.  When it was streaming his private server shenanigans, or co-opting the college football stadium for gamespace I enjoyed it, but now that's official gamer house, &lt;Method&gt;Esfand mode I'm very nonplussed.      
---
        
---
Guess I gotta grow out one of those floppy undercuts and get a septum ring now...
---
Image quality is poor, thats becuase it was taken on a CRT monitor when WoW first showed up.
---
Only thing that really matters in this list is sharding. 
---
While sitting in vent and eating before a raid, I jokingly told my boyfriend I was going to "cut his dick off" if he kept eating my fries.  I didn't know he had removed my push-to-talk setting so the whole raid heard me, and I was known as the chick who will cut your dick off forever after that. 😑
---
🥳🥳🥳
---
&gt;It's not talking about procing other things, like weapon enchants or DPS trinket effects, which is SotC's job. It's talking about procing the Holy damage from each swing.
---
You dont know this. You are just assuming that this is what it says because that would support the point you are trying to make. Only the guys that wrote the patch notes know, but consider this: The patch notes CLEARLY state black on white that Judgement of Righteousness can trigger procs.
---
Do you honestly believe that they would make a deliberate change to the judgement to make it able to proc, but the Seal itself getting the exact same mechanic in the same friggin patch was just a random bug they overlooked?
---
Its so crystal clear you are just trying to push some agenda to have Paladins nerfed here. Its completely ridiculous to claim it is a bug, and your so call proof, developers saying they pushed some of the vanilla changes over to TBC, does it no way prove that SoR was bugged from 1.9 to 2.0. It's not even close to what can be considered evidence and you have to be a drooling idiot to make a connection between the two.
---
Ok have fun swallowing Blizzards bullshit
---
SAVED
---
I think, you can have it either exactly as the original or improved by choosing in the settings. I'm playing as per the original personally.
---
Any updates on sharding?
---
Thank you.
---
More content if enough players money income, TBC is not. 
---
Anyone can make some good from fishing if you know what and where to catch.
---
Right, but what he's saying is the lore of vanilla was that the armies were off dealing with bigger problems so the citizens became the adventurers and you as a new player are having to deal with all these quests and threats because the armies are busy. However, starting by killing wolves and kobolds in a cave is a hell of a lot different than fighting bloodthirsty savage orcs while a field is burning on fire around you. Your first REAL threat in Elwynn is Hogger and it doesn't even make sense that a blackrock orc would be weaker than Hogger...
---
Nope, not since the last post that was made asking this.
---
Which was... 2 hours ago.
---
There’s a search on reddit, people. Seriously.
---
Personally it's just nice to see someone else excited for classic (got no irl friends that are excited) instead of just reading it in text.
---
And also I like watching classic stuff at night so more content for me to watch even if it's considered low effort.
---
What I really want to know is what they're planning to do for phase 7. Are they just going to open new server and do it all again, move into TBC, develop the game on a completely different direction a la Old School RuneScape? There's so many different ways they can go.
---
But will you be dancing, naked, on said mailbox?
---
The changes that have been mentioned as being made so far are either due to major differences in the client (Battle.Net Integration and Walljumping) or in company structure. (loot trading and right click to report are likely features added to deal with a potentially lower amount of GMs available to assist)  
---
Changing requirements for a quest would not follow under either of those unless there was a bug associated with them... which would not apply in the case of the AQ Gong.
---
Don't shoot the messenger, but there is, IMO, virtually no chance that sharding does _not_ extend to the 10-20 zones as well. 
---
0-10 takes only a couple of hours and will not be nearly enough to filter out the tourists. Level 10+ is when the leveling _really_ slows down and takes easily another ten hours minimum for an inexperienced player.
---
 ^Wooooooooouuuuuhhhhhh! 
---
it doesn't make them better, that curse is your spell.
---
the warlock casts it. 
---
i really don't get why everyone shits on warlock when they easily contribute the most damage to a raid.
---
swear im gonna develop an add-on that takes all the damage caused by utility curses and makes it show up in your floating combat text.
---
Mt has quel Serrar.
---
New open world PvP content: Barber Shop. 
---
It's like the regular retail barber shop, except there's only one for both factions, it's put into contested territory and you remain attack-able while on the seat. 
---
Would probably create more WPvP than the Silithus PvP and all the Eastern Plaguelands towers combined. 
---
I'd say there are no more than a few hundred players who got to 60 before DM launch. It was effectively in at launch for 99.99% of players.
---
Did you do it digitally? If so a 1080p version for a mouse mat would be so cool.
---
What happens after that?
---
Sure bud. 
---
Maybe they are fresh recruit orcs who have to take care of the Northshire invasion because the armies are off dealing with bigger conquests. 
---
They said in the post that they would be redoing loot tables and drops in 1.10 but did they talk about reworking the stats on items that were always available? The difference between 1.2 Savage Gladiator Chain and 1.12 Savage Gladiator Chain is quite significant for example
---
Exactly, classic wow is worth $0.50 a day to me, easily. 
---
That sounds familiar. I was kicked from a guild as well for something similar (not that it mattered as it was a shit guild anyway). Wasn't proud of it, but was glad that it happened as it led me to end up in a much more competent, mature guild. In my experience guilds with petty staff like that are horribly managed, usually filled with thin skinned manchilds that never went out of their social bubbles. By the way it's beyond me how they thought Russians to be a race (they're a collection of ethnicities). But obviously they needed something to skip beyond the 2 other warnings to get you out.
---
You sound like a low rank
---
He did make videos prior to his Patreon opening.
---
I remain steadfast in believing his best content is his video essay style of "why Classic WoW was great - XYZ" and going over a feature, or a quest chain or a zone or anything and giving his thoughts on it. It was an enjoyable take from someone else that was well thought out and reasonably agreeable, even if I personally disagreed with his views on it.
---
His thoughts on WoW:C news? Sorry man, but I can read it myself in 2-3 minutes, I don't need a 10:02 video to tell me. This isn't just him though, I don't need/want/care for Esfand, Staysafe, or anybody else to read out loud a blue post I already saw.
---
Of course, lightness and having low dag is key to getting from the auctioneer to the mailbox rapidly. 
---
Yeah no, PServer players are the reason we have classic at all.
---
Not to mention the fact that this sub would be blowing the fuck up if a release date was announced.
---
Yup, Dire Maul on release was going to turn MC and Ony into a fucking joke, this was such a good idea, I really hop Phase 2 is 5 months out from Phase 1.
---
So since most of t2 drops in bwl, and the head drops in onyxia, legs in MC, does that mean that tier 2 will have a staggered release?
---
I'd be down for the honor system to be added relatively quickly.
---
They never said they only had 1.12 data. In the original watercooler post where they explained: "we decided on Patch 1.12: Drums of War as our foundation, because it represents the most complete version of the classic experience."
---
Then, in the BlizzCon panel (or at least the article they posted summarizing the panel) they said "Thankfully, that problem was fixed very quickly after launch, and when we looked, we found data going back to version 1.12—and even earlier."
---
So it sounds like 1.12 was both a design decision and a technical limitation. It was likely the most complete data set they had but also the developers believed it was a solid foundation for Classic. Now they're using some of the other data they have to recreate Vanilla progression, at least a little bit.
---
To me, I’m just happy knowing it will be a temporary experience. On pservers, it’s been super frustrating when servers aren’t stable. If I can experience the rush of launch at 20 instead of fighting for an hour over apples in Elwynn, that’s fine with me :)
---
Weapon skill &gt; all for pve
---
As opposed to during AQ when everyone was running around with t0.5?
---
&gt; Human is only for early raids that are easy anyways.
---
What does this even mean? The weapon skill bonus is relevant for the entire game...
---
Crazy idea but...new storyline. No Dark Portal let's do some Alternate timeline shit and see where this WoW ends up. 
---
I found the sour lemon.
---
As much as I'd like to see this change; I have my doubts Blizzard will actually do anything of the sort.
---
Not to mention the #NoChanges crowd would [literally screech like a triggered feminist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erecy2mgwjI) if Blizzard did this...
---
Melee won't crush the DPS meter as quickly since gear scaling will be slowed and (I think) some of the pre BIS items won't be properly itemized at the start
---
isn't this ignoring the fact that Curse of Elements / Curse of Recklessness are spells that a Warlock brings and Mage doesn't? isn't it completely true that a Warlock contributes more raid damage than a Mage? sure, you can only bring two or three, but it's there.
---
Why is Gummy there?
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
---
default ui best ui
---
Damn. Your pc was good enough to have view distance that far in Orgrimmar? 
---
Not really. I don't love what they did with WoW since WotLK, I don't love how they killed off HotS or what they did with the current hearthstone balance. I don't love how they announced a mobile diablo instead of D4. They've done a lot more bad than good over the past few years, getting something right for once doesn't earn them love.
---
This was made in a map creator.
---
https://inkarnate.com/
---
Super easy to do. A very nice tool!
---
You 100% only lost durability on your equipped items. I know because I played a warrior back then and always carried around like 3 sets of gear, and definitely would not have done that if gear in your bags also took a hit lol
---
Yes it's a huge deal and balance issue.
---
This is my hope to be honest. On Mal'ganis I was one of the first players at the Portal when the event began (to earn the tabard which I still wear when I feel like logging in), and while this was long ago and I likely remember it wrong I feel like I was THE FIRST player defending the gate for a few moments. Either way I really want to re-experiance that moment, and whatever option Blizzard gives me will be welcome. This update does a lot to reinforce our hope and confidence in the project I think, and would love to see a new expansion every 2 or 3 years added to it
---
Ah I see, youre a man of culture as well
---
Even still, from a time investment it's inefficient.  Even if it turns 4 hour clears (about the time my vanilla guild cleared Naxx when it was on farm) to 1-1.5 hour clears that's dwarfed by the additional time it takes for everyone to farm for the consumable mats (either farming the mats or farming the gold to buy the mats/consumables) is going to dwarf that by an order of magnitude.  
---
Look I'm not saying it's not possible, just that I doubt it becomes the new standard means of tanking for all raids/guilds.  
---
So Naxx *isn't* Blizzard bullshit? In an ideal situation I want Naxx removed altogether, so technically I'll be swallowing less Blizzard bullshit than you do.
---
That’s all fair. I guess I’ll look at the economy at 60 and make a call when I’m dropping Tailoring. It does seem like a bit of a waste to run engineering on a healer though. Tanks and DPS are forced into it, but healers have options
---
90% of us on this sub are hoping for classic TBC. It's the logical progression choice and once Naxx has been on farm for a bit, people will begin to demand it. 
---
Yes only the helm and legs are available at launch
---
Cool
---
It's actually [Arr-doyn](https://youtu.be/kFM6RSCzPgI?t=24).
---
It’s really, really nice for ZG and AQ rep as well as crafting. Crafters will get recipes faster, and exalted ZG rep will get you gear enchantments. Rep w/ the AQ factions opens up the gong quest line and some gear. 
---
F for Flash dude
---
Ok bro, sure, you're right, you used the word "easier" in your post.
---
Huge
---
If you are playing a priest or warlock. The fight isn't about health. It's about controlling the mana. Play as efficiently as possible while fighting to stay alive. Get off your mana burns and mana drains. Then at the right time. Got in for the kill when they are too tired to defend themselves. 
---
The real problem is that he's putting those items on the AH for 200g. If you can farm 350g in the same amount of time, he should put them on the AH for 400g.
---
We'll probably acquire our pre-DM pre-BiS items just in time for the release of DM.
---
Dw i was never inside (still amusing to see people defend the hexagon pupils). Is it even that controversial of a position? Why not keep the new graphics with the option to disable them, like they did with the player model overhaul? 
---
Nice. Shows they're listening to players.
---
As someone that started WoW during the AQ event it will be interesting to play with content "missing" from the world.
---
Yes, I zoomed in a little for a good shot back then.
---
In mop my brother transferred and kept his titles. Idk of any earlier transfers
---
I would imagine they start looking at TBC if that's what the community is interested in (that's about as much as they've said on the topic). When that will happen and how it will be done, no one will know for a few years.
---
&gt;I'm the only one in this thread who is trying to fix SotC so that it deserves to be put back on your hotkey bar.
---
SotC is simply put a terrible ability. You only ever use it for the Judgement. Your idea of "fixing" the seal seem to be similar to trying to fix a Warriors Slam ability by nerfing Mortal Strike and Bloodthirst. It's absurd.
---
When do we get battlegrounds?  My brother and I are aching for some organized PVP!
---
What is wrong with people who played on Tichondrius?
---
Yeah it was digital
---
Vanilla wasn't balanced. Min Maxxers are gonna go with other races for their PvE capabilities. Someone who picks tauren for that reason alone is just that. A PvPer.
---
Gear scaling is completely broken post naxx. Balance goes to shit. I don't think post Naxx level 60 content is viable unless they do a stat squish.
---
I'm 100% certain that whatever experience they cobble together will have greater authenticity than my 15-years-old memories.
---
You must be a very rare case. I had plenty of PvP on my alliance toon going to SM and RFD, despite I avoided STV like plague on my leveling routes.
---
My Horde toon was on a PvE server, even then I had some PvP in Felwood.
---
My problem was I attempted to level enchanting and tailoring with my guys level, I think it was around Runecloth that I said "Ok fuck this! I can barely pay my repair bills let alone buy all this stupid shit and hardly anyone wants my weak sauce enchants!"             
---
As soon as I stopped I realized just how much cash that shit ate up but it was too late the damage was done, I was 45-ish and just started grinding cash for my normal mount. Live and learn."
---
I forgot about recipes!
---
You get some pretty crazy axes not long into raiding and they are bis for the longest period. When you enter with BIS gear human is decent but that ends pretty quick. You will be dpsing as fury. The bonus doesn't work in pvp. That's why it's a bigger deal for Orcs. If you do lots of PvP you don't bother with human. Rogue is different. Swords are BIS pretty much the whole way so the racial is really strong.
---
I am curious as to what happens when we reach the end of phases, do they just leave it at that with no future updates? Wipe the server and start again? Or introduce tbc? Or other. 
---
I had you figured for one of those guys who didn't need a blaring statement of my intention behind every post /s
---
Well, maybe next time you'll get it.  ^^^^/s
---
They also stated for years they had no intention of remaking classic. Which means I doubt they cared enough to look around for old info. If Blizz headquarters is anything like my call center. They have a room, where all the ancient/broken tech gets tossed and forgotten. Where as with my call center all that will be on those pc's is outdated info. At blizzard those old outdated pc's might contain treasure untold lol.
---
Personally speaking I don't think having Dire Maul in at release was going to affect that much.
---
And to be perfectly honest in my own opinion: the original 4 phase release schedule seemed largely fine to me.
---
A 6 phase release schedule can't sustain more than a 4 month maximum release schedule (compared to the original release schedule before TBC launched).  
---
I also think the tier .5 content should be available earlier.  The regular dungeon gear, aside from being aesthetically pleasing, is largely trash for most classes.  The tier .5 gear rectifies this by making the stats actually worth wearing and the gear relevant early on (where you need it...prior to finishing MC).  
---
What's the point of releasing tier .5 gear at stage 5 when it's largely going to be useless/non-existant for all but the most casual of non-raiders?
---
This is the inherent problem with the "NOChanges" crowd.  By being so absolutist in their thinking their actually holding hostage what could be a more pleasant experience the 2nd time around (Playing Vanilla WoW) 
---
There are numerous QoL changes that would also be BENEFICIAL to add. Doesn’t mean any of them should be, just like it doesn’t mean the mats for the quest should change.  
---
Although the War Effort is a bit different and likely something they would potentially want to discuss, if they aren’t/haven’t already.
---
Funny how quickly the OP decided Josh Allen was talking about him with his reference to "dickbags".  Almost as if OP instantly understands what group he's part of.
---
I like the default ui as well but I always use a bag addon, always felt weird having 5 backpacks like who would ever walk around like that. 
---
This was a WoW forum joke that Tichondrius players said to other players to imply Tichondrius was to hard core for them to play on.
---
It was more of a BC era joke that revolved around arena IIRC.  Tichondrius was notorious for having some downright savage PvP  players.
---
yeah thats what I kinda thought too. I guess this time around people will be hitting 60 faster, but still not sure it's really going to have a big effect or not. I guess it depends on how long they wait to launch it
---
Magistrate shoulders - Check
---
In some ways MC actually looked cooler on the old crap PCs, the super short view distance and primitive fog effect makes it look like you're inside a furnace.
---
In a master loot situation it's whatever loot rules they set (hopefully clearly communicated beforehand)
---
In a 5 man if it's like your 3rd+ from BIS then you might as well roll need
---
You know what? Why should i fucking read the article when Esfand can read it for me and on top of that i can have a good chuckle? He is a great guy, with great humour and a fucking classicy attitude. We live in the age of internet and gaming especially in the age of streamers and content creators i don‘t see why someone shouldn‘t do that. It is so fucking annoying to defend yourself or another one for having fun with what they do and/or consume.
---
Why does it fucking bother you? I dont get it really im fucking mad right now.
---
I transferred my paladin at least once every expansion. She was all over the place. Always had my title. 
---
In leveling dungeons and probably even level 60 5 mans nobody really gives a shit what your spec is UNTIL IT CAUSES A WIPE
---
In raids yes you will need to conform or you're wasting 39 other people's time
---
Some say he is still pooping to this day.
---
&gt;But all classes are going to be a little saturated at the start
---
This doesn't make sense
---
I don’t know why but people in this sub think vanilla is way more difficult than it actually was. Sure it has its challenges and complexities, but I feel like a lot of people completely overestimate the difficulties and barriers the game offers. It wasn’t that bad. 
---
1) More expensive monthly fee will discourage multiboxing + gold sellers (maybe) 
---
2) you can buy tokens in retail and play classic.  
---
I think there's just some sensitivity about people who don't actually have much real experience with Vanilla making very broad public statements about what's authentic and what the community wants. 
---
Time's up chums, let's do this
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Xp. More options for leveling up is always better.
---
* Basically no Non-US player were 60 by the time DM went out. So for them it will mostly be a change more than anything else. Who is right then? US or the rest of the world?
---
* Ragnaros went out in 1.4 afaik. Nochanges should by screaming that Ragnaros will be up in phase 1 in Classic, right?
---
I am sure there are other examples.
---
I think we’ll start seeing more regular updates as we get closer. If they had a release date confirmed, we would have gotten it by now so I’m guessing they’re still trying to iron some things out. 
---
Engineering is the best profession hands down for any class for pvp and pve because its utility is useful at every stage of the game.  A teleporter, ranged stuns, sapper charges, resistance trinkets, leveling gear, battle chickens.  Some classes need tailoring (caster epic chests and bloodvine), and in those cases i would still go tailoring and engineering.  Alchemy can be leveled on an alt or a good friend will hook you up.  Guilds will have a couple of alchs who take all the good recipes anyways.  
---
Start with mining and herbs, once you have all the mats for maxing engineering and a decent stash of stones, drop mining for herbs.  Herbs/engineering is bis for raiding.  Alt will be either an alch or tailor (for transmute cooldowns) and mining.  Also have a lvl 5 alt for disenchanting.

And that’s how I met... Abraham Lincoln. Mhmm. *Abe*raham Lincoln.
---
You have no idea what you''re talking about. Vanilla wasn't hard and classic won't be hard lmao
---
Note, **part** of Blizzard.
---
Also, the game itself is old and made by entirely different people. The blizzard of today could never make such a game.
---
I'm sorry, but I don't accept it.
---
**Mal'Ganis and the Goon Squad ♥♥♥♥♥**
---
Nice story, but there's no need for the passive aggressive title.  
---
Games can have or not have "heavy handed" dev involvement and it's just fine.  Generally speaking the more tools on a miniscule level you have, the less you need overarching involvement or guiding.
---
To explain this better let me use an example: 
---
The more you are able to affect things on a very basic principle, the less you need other stuff influencing it.  Similar to how minecraft, or other survival games, give you nothing to start off with and you make your own way so to speak.  You build from LITERALLY the ground up, making everything you need.  Because of this you don't need guidance because you are using logic and reasoning to make the basics which then further progress.
---
Because WoW is attempting to tell a story, it needs to hold our hands so to speak.  Many of the stories are intertwined.  This causes some people to feel like there's too much "overbearing guidance" (which gets further exacerbated in later expansions...)  but the basis of that mindset is there.
---
It boils down to two distinct principles:
---
**Are you telling a story?** 
---
Or 
---
**Are you letting players create their own story?**  
---
You can obviously create your own stories/moments in Vanilla WoW, but the over-arching premise of WoW is that it's telling a story very loosely.  (Dragon flight aspects, ancient evils buried beneath the sand,  troll gods returning to the world, etc etc).  One does not obviate the other, but they are fundamentally at their core, conflicting ideologies when it comes to game development.
---
Almost all of what you talked about will exist in classic.
---
Yeah, but hiding his name and adding the website as "author" is not cool.
---
Yea, I knew one of you dudes in real life. He was an odd fellow. Play human with short hair. Meanwhile the rest of us all played Horde. He just HAD to be the odd one out.
---
&gt;Tichondrius was notorious for having some downright savage PvP players.
---
And also Alea and Steelballa.
---
Project Ascension. 
---
Duhhh but this is why everyone says "oh that private server that starts with a k is undertuned" despite the fact that it was all backed up by clear data showing what the armor values were
---
Classic is going to be piss easy if they don't deliberately BUFF the content
---
It’s current wow difficulty dialed up, slower gameplay, more in depth classes and builds etc. I played the beta and it just felt more engrossing than current retail. And it was a beta lol. Classic will be more challenging and require to be a better player. The only thing retail has over classic atm is mythic but I imagine we are going to be surprised at how challenging heroic raids are going to be. 
---
&gt; armor debuffs WILL NOT STACK
---
Source?
---
Every passing month these guys seem to be becoming the Blizzard of old. I *really* wish they continue this trend. I want to love this company again.
---
I wonder if they will ever recycle servers through this patch cycle or is it 'one and done'?
---
Why wait? Head over to r/wow and read all about how Classic servers will be dead in 2 months tops and this is just another nail in the coffin.
---
Couldn't agree more. Despite the early lack of trust from the community side, the classic devs just keep coming up with nice decisions and proof that they actually do listen. Thank you classic wow team!
---
Honestly I really understand both sides of the argument. Surely we can all agree the best solution is just to have that quick conversation at the beginning of a run so you're all on the same page :)
---
Fair enough
---
It's code in version control. It doesn't take a lot of storage. They don't need to go find an "old PC" to turn on and check... they just go onto the shared server of hosted code and can literally say "OK, check out the code as it was in patch 1.12" and the computer will go "oh my god that's a long time ago... that will be.... 10 seconds please."
---
It's code, computers are fast, programmers know how to keep historical versions.
---
I think [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/761/222/35e.png) would be a good representation of them.
---
I guess you won’t be playing classic.
---
Yes, the quests as well as all of the well itemized loot that drops from the quest bosses.
---
Sourced posted and fixed on the pserver that starts with a K long ago.
---
But all the fanboys of the other servers say "lol K server too easy"
---
Can't wait for classic to show everyone what a piss easy joke Vanilla bosses are with 1.12 talents
---
Whenever i fish for goldmaking purposes, i never get past 30min, which will only net you 5-10 of the important fish.  I find that i can fish for longer periods when i afk or catchup on discord or simplu focus on filling up my own stash.  The change in mindset makes all the difference to me
---
I personally fail to see how breaking ToS can "create very expensive customer support incidents". 
---
I'm not trying to be an ass here, that's a serious statement. Having to use alts for a bank in a hassle, but if you account share and get fucked by it, I fail to see why blizz should be expected to do anything about it. 
---

---
&gt;I doubt it becomes the new standard means of tanking for all raids/guilds.
---
Absolutely. The vast majority of guilds and raids will be relatively low end. Only the best of the best will go be stacking consumes, wbuffs, and so on.
---
all my screenshots are super pixelated lol
---
adds to the vanilla factor imo :p  thats how you know they're legit 
---
i love "dedication to violate ToS" xD
---
Oh no my posting doesn't meet the high standards of some guy who seemingly just backseat mods all over the place. What a thrilling life that must be!
---
Likewise
---
Indeed, they haven't, yet. 
---
I don't think so.  It sounds like it  will be 1.12 data with phased ***content*** release.  
---
i.e. releasing the 1.10 added gear (Titanic Leggings etc.) when the 1.10 phase starts.  
---
They have both options, which honestly worries me.  I fear the purists will be playing with Classic settings, but people will figure out that Modern settings can see through water or ground clutter better and will use it to their advantage.
---
Why?
---
Yeah :( This is what I'm really sad about.
---
Gonna farm it and do all the quests anyway.
---
You don't need a specialised set of healing blues for levelling instances.
---
as someone who has been in the officer core of a pServer guild for a few years, the way we do it is to have an extra shared account that a few of the core has. This works just fine but obviously paying for another account in classic to do this same thing would be pretty annoying. Which is why I think it'd be cool to have the gbank added, but i doubt it will. and i will most likely be sharing the cost of an extra account with a couple other guildies.
---
This. Why would someone who has virtually no experience with vanilla be a voice for the community? He doesn’t know jack shit. 
---
Hold up, there is an option to use "Classic" settings or updated ones in the interface.
---
hmm I didn't know that, I haven't played since WotLK. But it's a good suggestion!
---
Let's hope so.
---
Or (as it was in retail) full T2 will drop in MC first.
---
Does Demoralizing Shout/Roar generate exponential threat?
---
I remember reading that Demo Shout applies threat per mob affected.  So if it generates X threat on 1 mob, and you demo shout 3 mobs, it will give each mob 3X threat.
---
While I'm not sure that's the case, and it doesn't jive with everything else I know about threat, I have noticed that if I spam demo shout on a couple of mobs I tend to lose them fairly quick, but if I spam on a large group they stay glued to me like the pieces of the model kit I tried to put together.  
---
&gt; just like in vanilla! #nochanges
---
How does it not make sense? Some people will stop playing all together after a few days to a week. Some will decide to roll a different class or decide on a different spec. 
---
It's an mmo. And classic is actually played like one.
---
If your DPS warrior friend farms 25 banans an hour, you as a healer will make sure you two farm 65 bananas an hour and split it. It'll help you both.
---
That's already somewhat implemented. Dates they were earned.

---
I'm taking a week off work. If I can't play the game because of stupid opinions like yours I will be very pissed off. A weeks holiday is a huge chunk of everything I can take in a year
---
I like it, but still waiting to hear the most important thing to me (PvP). Hope PvP gear is in Phase 2.
---
Best way is to try retail. What laptop does he have? Which could and graphic card (wow can be run with integrated graphics)
---
My gf will be the one pushing to raid while I wanna fun around :D
---
Both
---
They are similar. It's quality of life and imo orc provides that more for the pvp aspect. 
---
Great point. I think WoW was best when its principles hybridized, kind of between the principles you describe in the last paragraph. I do not agree that there is an essential conflict. The devs guided players through quest lines and into dungeon+raids but took their hands off the reins by providing a vast world to explore with vast amounts of crafting, gathering, out of the way rep grinds, PvP choke points, rare spawns, exploration, and other weirdness, one of which was necessary. They found a nice balance; so nice that it kicked off a 15 year "vanilla was a sandbox" vs. "no, idiot, it was not close to a sandbox" debate about a game that was partially a sandbox. 
---
Not really at the end of the day you still had 9 classes with 3 specs each shoved into 3 roles.
---
I checked out the Retail requirements, and any laptop from the last few years should work given that it's 2GB of RAM and onboard graphics (I have no idea how to judge a CPU anymore).
---
Buuuut he's bitchy about low quality graphics.  He's earning enough money to buy a cheap desktop, though.
---
Is it still going to be 1.12 versions of the items that are available at start? Savage Gladiator Chain for example
---
I mean it is his job. He can't not make money.
---
Best of luck with this guild! I'd join , but I am from South America. 
---
I played rogue, mainly PvP (both bgs and world PvP). A lot of it.
---
No one counters a rogue really.. with correct gear and PvP talent builds you can win against ant class. But some classes are tougher than other. Warlocks and SP were a pain because of dots breaking stealth (vanish) and first aid, as well as a well geared ench shaman.
---
Hunters can be tricky if you let them attack you first.
---
But rogues are without a doubt the most powerful PvP class. Watch world of roguecraft :) it goes episode 3 first, then 2 and then 1 for some reason.
---
Rogue - not because people didn’t know how to play. Rogues could “get in and get out” easily making it sustainable and also strong burst potential on unsuspecting targets
---
Looking for a late-night/early-morning raiding guild on a NA-PVP server. I intend on rolling a healer preferably a paladin or shaman depending on what faction the guild decides to go with. Will be doing World PVP in my spare time so if anyone is interested in that too I'd definitely be up for it. I have previous vanilla experience playing a warrior in the original game and a rogue on a private server. Made it through AQ 40 so I'm aware of what is required in terms of farming for consumables. Only real issue I have is the weird time requirements at least for the foreseeable future due to my job but I have to imagine there are more 3rd shift people like myself on here. Just send a PM or a discord link and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks!

&lt;Knights of Fire&gt; (Name TBD) | EU PVP Server, Alliance | Semi-Hardcore Raiding.
---
Are you looking for a guild to play Classic as classic was? We're looking for players that are looking to experience all the Classic content without the cookie-cutter meta maxing. 
---
We're looking to deviate from the standard expected and clear content regardless. That means you can play the class you like, in the spec you like. If you want to meta-max you're absolutely welcome to, but it's not an expectation or requirement from us. 
---
Progression raids will be 3 nights a week with EU times to be decided based on availability. We will also be running nightly dungeon groups/farming runs.
---
PVP will be dabbled in but not the guilds main focus. Expect casual premades and world pvp on availability outside of raid times.
---
Ultimately, Knights of Fire is looking to deliver a fun focused experience with a hint of hardcore, leveraging experience of the game to overcome hardship.
---
Accepting brand new players and experienced raiders alike. Join: https://discord.gg/KQAkS4X 
---
Pservers are not a model that Blizzard can make money off of.You think Bobby Kotick cares about a few thousand per week?  
---
Im happy about the staggered content. It gives casual players like myself some room to keep up and experience more of the game.
---
TIMES CHANGE!
---
Troll has better damage in pve by a tiny margin, orc is godlike in pvp.
---
You can solo. But going with a friend kind of change the difficulty from nightmare to normal. And a third friend to easy as cake.
---
It's worth playing with friends.
---
Its interesting to me that you used words i never used and tried to argue with me about a point i never made lol. Reading comprehension is real. I definitely know what im talking about and none of it says the game is hard lol.
---
Okay, thanks! Now the big question: where does it stop? TBC? Because it feels like once you open one X-Pac, you're opening a can of worms. It feels like it's gonna be hard to draw the line, while still keeping everyone interested for an indefinite amount of time.
---
&gt; I'm genuinely not trying to be hostile, but I would really like to see what numbers you don't think is right on private servers. 
---
They clear MC in one third the time. That requires, roughly, three times the DPS anyone ever had in real vanilla. That's, er, implausible.
---
&gt; Yes, I do. There's definitely things which weren't known about, or things which they didn't know the power of. One of them is powershifting with Wolfshead Helmet which is BiS throughout Vanilla AND TBC, yet I don't recall anybody actually using it seriously. +weapon skills. Certain trinkets like the spell hit trinket from ZG, instead of having to gear Warriors in T3 to make taunting easier on 4 horsemen, BRE and so forth.
---
Add that all up and it's nothing like a tripling of DPS. Got anything remotely big enough to explain the discrepancy?
---
&gt; Let me ask you the opposite. Do you really think Elitist Jerks and the other top guilds knew everything about Vanilla and how to optimize your character?
---
Can we have this discussion in good faith please? "Everything" is an absurd attempt to move the goalposts. I am saying your friend cannot possibly be ten feet tall, and you are saying "are you sure you know *everything* about height and nutrition?". I don't need to know everything, just enough to know your claim is implausible.
---
&gt; I'm not debating whether or not mages know how to spam one button better than back then, but if you want to delve into that, sure. I'm arguing the understanding of gear, stats and so forth is higher than back then, which leads to the difference between two mages.
---
Okay, explain how this "understanding" triples DPS.
---
&gt; Also, using Warlocks and Mages is a terrible example, since they're some of the more simple classes to DPS as.
---
"That is a terrible example, because I can't argue against it and it proves me completely wrong!". Also mages and warlocks are still among the top DPS in pirate server logs as far as I can tell, so it can't be the case the case the more skill-sensitive classes are the only ones doing more DPS.
---
Put it this way, suppose I said that on a truly Blizzlike server I levelled a hunter from nothing to sixty, solo, in forty hours /played. You'd call bullshit, right? Because no matter how good I am there is a rock solid floor in terms of how fast you can run and how fast you can DPS in this game, and no amount of skill can move that floor one millimetre. Even if I discovered some cool trick nobody else ever did, it couldn't make that big a difference, right?
---
Same deal here. *Something* is screwy, whether or not the people whose egos depend on pirate server achievements being legit are emotionally able to admit it.
---
It’s extremely uncharacteristic of Blizzard to be communicative in this sort of fashion. For me, it means a great deal that they are being transparent and receptive to the playerbase 
---
Count me in the 10%. I hated the way TBC emptied out the primary continents and how flying mounts killed world pvp. 
---
Or just remove them from your friend list? ;P
---
I thought the main reason was because you'd otherwise be scrolling through the one visible action-bar? The artwork was cool. 
---
So I can play classic with the new graphics and models? 
---
They might play horde but they gave alliance every advantage they could. Thats partially why I like the horde. I'm a fan of the underdog.
---
Unsubstantiated rumor.
---
This is great news. I’m hyped.
---
Take your week off later so the surge is gone? There's no release date yet, so you can't have already put in for a specific week already. An empty server and packed zones are easy enough to avoid if you just exercise restraint and good judgement on when you take time off work and start playing.         
---
Besides, if they truly bring back old philosophy the server sizes will be influenced by queues heavily anyways. So rather than be swamped, you'll just wait in a line of 8k or so to get on. That's also fine with me.
---
THIS IS GETTING ME HARDER THAN TERMINATOR ARMOR!
---
I think Project 1999 (EverQuest classic server) has shown the longevity of these sorts of projects. That server has released about 2 and a half years worth of content over the course of about 9 and a half years so far. Despite offering a "limited" scope of content, the server's held strong over nearly 10 years. Currently 1276 players online, which is quite good when you consider the final expansion / major content release was almost 4 years ago and the fact that a classic EQ private server is pretty niche.
---
Releases classic WoW on new engines that my less than a decade old iMac can’t play.
---
Thanks a fucking lot for nothing.
---
Unknown at this time. They had it due to hitbox codeing shenanigans that's not in the current engine. Just like with spell batching it would have to be coded back in.
---
One other problem I see with this is in this scenario you're not accounting for the extra time it is taking Person B. Person A has his potions and flasks. He's done. Person B needs to (presumably) sell items (unless that is taken into consideration with the 5 hours) and then buy the potions and flasks, which may or may not be available. Or purchase the materials and find an alchemist to make them.
---
I'm not saying the point doesn't hold up, but those are things to take into consideration when you're figuring out what is most efficient.
---
Superfluous artwork was always superfluous. Wasting UI space on it took away from space you could dedicate to the actual game.
---
I installed bartender before I even left Mulgore back in the day.

---
Demoralizing shout generates a flat amount of threat on every mob in range.
---
Threat from heals is spread equally among all mobs in combat, lowering the amount of threat you need to generate on each individual mob to hold aggro, which is why demoralizing shout easily holds threat off healers when there are a lot of mobs.
---
are there any sims out there to show the diff?
---
I agree with this. One of my biggest pet peeves with Retail is that they started down a path of making all options viable but what they ended up doing was making all choices meaningless. When there are no consequences to your choices then it's not really any choice at all.
---
The latest was scaled zones. Only played Legion because I didn't want to buy BfA but it's such a boring leveling experience. 4-5 zones of mobs scaled to be virtually identical relative to your character.
---
Tanking as a prot warrior in vanilla and into early TBC heroics really was a character building experience for my early teens.
---
I think superfluous is just a matter of opinion though, and I don't know many people who actively disliked that element of the UI. So I don't know if it's fair to frame it as a general statement that it was "most of the reason," and instead more fair to frame it as personal statement. 
---
Wait, are you the R1 Pinkranger?
---
Pets die alot in classic bc there was no reduce on aoe on pets 
---
I wonder if we will see The return of righteous Dawn, social butterflies, Hyperion or virtual dragon slayers.
---
You want me to miss the launch of the game we have been waiting for a decade to play, just so you can afk in the starting zone waiting for mobs to spawn?

&gt;  killed KT and got rank 14.
---
1st part yes, 2nd part only rank 10. 
---
Looks about right, especially if you try to go through that tunnel without getting to neutral with them.
---
Yes.
---
When were battlegrounds and pvp system added? Was it 1.4? Does that mean classic will launch without bg's?
---
Would be pretty dope ngl, I hate instanced content 
---
If you're focusing on pvp you're super gimping yourself already by being an alliance warlock, just saying
---
Classic cynics is probably what got this changed.
---
Both for sure. Also this new plan might open up new possibilities, since not everything is available at the start. 
---
You mean Gummie?  Numbers!  Getting 40 people together in those days was no small feat, hats off to any raid leaders from those days.
---
Soon. 
---
I'm more concerned with a hundreds of dead servers a month after the release. It is no 2005 anymore when wow population was only going up and the only concern about the servers  was to keep them from going down doe to insane demand. A shitload of people will leave in a month so either shading or merges are absolutely necessary. . Of course I will much prefer merges over sharing any day of the week but I will take sharding over doing nothing. You cannot just sit there and to nothing like it is 2005, it will kill the game
---
Thanks, took a bunch that day (I think we spent 6-7 hours in there) but that one stood out, mostly 'cause I hid the UI which took up 3/4 of the screen.
---
I'll second this. As much as I love my Warlock  for all around fun, for a WPvP toon I'd go Rogue. Absolutely brutal on the jump.
---
PS dont have a clue about how half the stuff really worked. PS players are going to be in for a rude awakening when classic gets here. Go watch Tips Out video 15 Mechanics We Know Will Be Different In Classic 
---
A world with nothing but rogues walking around in stealth hoping to find someone to 100-0 stun lock.
---
Internet archives of websites back then still have itemization. It's probably how Nost found it. Nost would probably give them that data or apparently already did as well as the source like the allakhazam website address. Blizzard could also check anything there by changing the date in the archive.
---
**Now where them having a working 1.12 really comes into importance is things like boss armor values and resist values. We have ZERO data on that and all private servers were just guesses. Blizzard was not exaggerating in how big that was or lying about anything. It's a very big deal.** Casters may end up doing higher damage than they do on current private. Melee much less. Leveling will end up easier or harder depending on the mob having higher armor or innate resist.
---
The problem with that theory is if 2 mobs are hitting you, you need twice the heals, which means twice the threat is halved and the healer is generating the same TPS on each mob.
---
Uhh, it's the opposite of an opinion. They serve no purpose in the game except as decoration, that's the definition of superfluous.
---
Your *opinion* might be that you liked them and thought they looked cool, but that doesn't give them an objective reason to be there. Not all of us were 10 in vanilla.
---
Relating to the pvp / honour system. If you reached say, rank 13 and then lost it the next week. Did you keep the title you had earned as well as the ability to buy rank 13 gear? Or could you only buy / wear it when you were the rank required 
---
Very yes also.  
---
To throw an overused term around, it was totally immersive being in there the first few times, it felt like some crazy maze and all the bosses were massive, even though Majordomo turned out to be a little bit of a coward ;).
---
Is that a Freezing Band in the bag? This guy is pretty lucky.
---
&gt;  his video essay style of "why Classic WoW was great - XYZ" and going over a feature, or a quest chain or a zone or anything
---
And that's precisely what I *didn't* like. It is so obviously sure-fire way how to get views/likes that really looked not honest to me.
---
Like, you have a subreddit dedicated to classic so you release video "why Classic was great because of X" and BAM, instant upvotes. For example, the most overall loved classic dungeon is BRD, so Tips releases video "Why BRD is the BEST dungeon of all time!"... sigh
---
It's okay to like some things Blizzard does and criticize other things they do. You don't have to pull this "no true Scotsman" bullshit.
---
What an insane way to trivialize a fair point. "Not really at the end of the day we were all human beings playing on a pc!!! So!! Take that!"
---
The game was incredibly unique back then and OP made a fair point for one of the reasons. 
---
This already kind of happened.  All of my WoW friends have kids and full time jobs (I do too), we only play together for a month or so after each expansion drops only to be sucked back into real life and not talk to each other again.
---
What are heroic raids?
---
Exactly. I’ve been saying this too. A really simple algorithm like you’ve outlined pretty much solves this problem. Alternatively, having a group text set up and the first person able to get logged on just messages everyone in the group the realm works too...
---
As a side note, I think major streamers should release their algorithm ahead of time and someone can collect them here so us plebs can know which servers do/don’t have streamers on them and make our choices accordingly. 
---
Also, I think it would be cool if someone makes a survey with type of realm (PvP, PvE, RP, RP PvP), continent (NA, EU, Oceania), faction and e-mail and then tries to make equally sized factions on specific realms. The only other information you’d need would be server size and just limit groups to like 50% of the realm size. A week before launch, they can just send the algorithm out for the people assigned to each realm. It could give a sort of cool meta if all of us were clustered on a handful of realms and it might keep those realms from dying/being merged. Thoughts?
---
The lack of trust was a bit warrented imo. Im glad to be proven wrong in this scenario. 
---
Some players of some classes were probably doing some things suboptimally, especially if they were trying to make a cool video as well as fight. And they aren't around to explain their choices - maybe they were saving rage for an emergency, maybe they wanted access to some spell that wasn't available in fury stance, maybe their dog was going nuts and they weren't at their best, we'll never know.
---
If people cleared MC 20% faster I'd totally believe it could be due to skill under Blizzlike mechanics. It's the claims that people do MC in half an hour when the best vanilla speed clears were three times that, or clear MC in greens when it took people in purples months to get Rag down at all that seem impossible given what we know of WoW's skill ceiling.
---
It was definitely first time for a lot of us, from memory we had just merged with another guild who raided in the same timezone (NZ/AUS) on our server, we were lucky enough to be lead through by a couple people from the top guild on our server at the time.
---
What keybinds, this guy clearly clicks. LOL. Also, default UI is the only way I play the game. Have done so since 2005. LETS GO
---
I believe the implication of them calling out the 1.10 loot revamp in phase 5 means that we're going to see the versions of loot that were there at launch, then see them reitemizes in phase 5. However the exact details of how they intend to do the loot update are still unclear, only that they're directly calling out the issue.
---
Duuuude, I did that exactly for my first character. 
---
How should it be done? I was thinking of trying Tailoring/Enchant again, but after experiencing the pain the first time I'm not so sure. It wasn't until WoTLK that I got my professions to really work for me (I levelled as alch/herb on this character and in WoTLK rerolled to herb/inscription and it was waaaay better).

I make sure to avoid any Tauren players with any variation of "moo" or "bull" in their name.

The advantage provided by ranged weapon skill is very tiny.  
---
If you're rolling on a PVP server, choosing orc for the increase in PVP safety alone is a good enough reason.  
---
You have a slight damage advantage as a troll, but hunter rotations and skill cap is so high, you could probably skill past most of your competition by tryharding just a bit more than they do.  
---
Until the world's biggest tryhard rolls a troll, then you just say "yeah well I'm orc for PVP" as an excuse.  
---
Nothing quite like watching the mob you were killing slowly walk away with Hamstring on them until they pull a different mob
---
All while your desperately trying to finish them off.
---
500 people in a starting zone made for 10 isn’t fun. 
---
So much for the \#nochanges crowd, now you guys want Blizz to exclude Naxx?
---
You don't know what you want, you just *hope* that Classic will fill the Void in your Soul.
---
U need 66 and you'll be fine getting everything 
---
Lots of things in a video game serve no more purpose than decoration or aesthetics. So you have to argue for what line is drawn at being objectively "superflous." Subjectively I get that you think it doesn't need to be there. I also get into arguments in retail forums about how many roots stop someone from smoothly running around a zone. Are the roots and other objects that lend to a certain zone aesthetic objectively superfluous because they serve no purpose? 
---
Vanilla changed constantly throughout it's life and had further changes planned which were held back due to the release of TBC. 
---
Why do you draw a hard line at 1.12? If you accept the changes up to 1.12 why do you not accept the changes that were planned for classic but delayed until TBC?
---
My money is on TBC. A lot of people seem to want it, it's already done and they will have all the practice from vanilla.
---
If the dungeon forces you to tank enough mobs to make demoralizing shout better than battle shout or tab sundering then they are going to be much weaker than most mobs.
---
&gt; Steelballa
---
Holy crap I totally forgot about SteelBalla. He was like a server celebrity. Such a fun time to play WoW. Can't wait for that type of community again.
---
I'd be surprised if they're not there at launch. They have no impact on PvE and aren't a huge impact even in PvP with 5 min cd and limited CC breaking. Their solo purpose is to make small scale pvp just a bit less frustrating.
---
I really really hope so, i have to hand in my request for my weeks off this Summer at the end of this month. Please release date soooon
---
I'd rather be "back seat moderating" then just being an asshole who blatantly insults others for having a differing opinion.   I dont agree with everything and if people are allowed to express their support for something others should be allowed to express their disapproval/dissent for it as well. 
---
It's all about presentation.  You can piss on someone and convince them it's raining if you word it correctly.  That doesnt work if you just go around calling everyone you disagree with "retard".
---
A hidden message from Blizzard itself during Classic's presentation is hardly unsubstantiated.
---
Bro two words "Bubble Hearth". It's almost ironic paladins have almost no killer instinct. One would expect more zeal lol.
---
Something to do while waiting for the next blue post :D
---
Leveling my classic character over and over. Trying different specs, routes, and gearing strategies. I'm definitely improving and i like the experience.
---
Yeah, me too. 
---
And you sound like a \#nolife \#neckbeard, the epitome of the portrayal in the Southpark episode.
---
Does it give you a sense of *pride and accomplishment*?
---
It must have been a fierce battle for that pirate him that low. He really wanted to keep those boots.
---
I found the sheep.
---
Still thats most hard PvE encounter I ever meet at pservers. To be fair only mythic can compare to it. I miss it...
---
If they release pvp early you might live to regret it.  There were tards that never hit lvl 60 cus they got sucked into pvp too early and got addicted to that shit.  You’ll spend the rest of your life a lvl 54 paladin.  
---
&gt; My Horde toon was on a PvE server, even then I had some PvP in Felwood.
---
then unflag yourself?
---
I find that very unamoosing. 
---
Good bot. 
---
I'm playing PUBG &amp; Apex. Really helps.
---
Are you gonna compete in the classic Olympics or something ?
---
I must practice to have.. fun?
---
Joking aside, its vanilla wow man.. The game is not hard. And if you want to practice strafing and mouse turning you could literally play any shooter game.
---
Wanna practice casting X spell by pressing a button instead of clicking? Pick any game with action bars
---
Cheers
---
Yeah. Jesus, you had to get up to Honored just to unlock Heroic, wasn't it? Each **dungeon** had its own faction. You leveled in Hellfire always, so HFC heroics were a sure thing from the get go.
---
Now where do you go? Do you go for Terokkar, to gain rep for Auchindoun? Or do you go Zangarmash, to gain rep for Coilfang? After that, do you go Nagrand? Beautiful zone and lovely questing, but fuck that, there's no dungeons, so go to the other zone you didn't pick until you're high enough level to go to Blade's Edge.
---
Then you go Netherstorms, even though I thought Shadowmoon was more fun, because again, you want to get as much rep as possible pre-70 so you need to farm as little as possible for Tempest Keep.
---
(I can't actually remember what reps were relevant for Auchindoun and Tempest Keep though. Was it the Consortium for Tempest Keep, and the neutral faction in Shattrath?)
---
I'm practicing the social aspects/politics of being in a loot council raiding guild. That's by far the most challenging and important skill to develop for a raider.
---
iCare
---
“It’s not permanent” is the part a lot of people skip over on their cheetoh stained keyboard rage. 
---
These dorks would be the same ones to immediately fly to the forums about how horrible the lag and respawn times are if sharding wasn’t implemented at launch.
---
All I want is old school fishing
---
I saw the thumbnail and immediately experienced PTSD...  
---
... STUPID CHICKEN!
---
World pvp then yes rogue. You get to pick your own fight every time. Its crazy how strong surprise is on the open world.
---
+ put up a stand alone website for Classic with the old forums &amp; theme (screen shot of the day etc.)
---
Hi, /u/LainLain
---
If I recall correctly, in vanilla at first you could disenchant anything with just level 1 enchanting, but they eventually changed that in a later expansion. Is that correct?
---
I think you're confused.  Only a minority want to rush to endgame.  Most players think leveling is a massive part of the game.
---
Wonder if it will generate a following or if it will die out fast once the nostalgia goggles wear off for most people.
---
All really good news now the next thing i really want to know is what Alterac valley version we will get and i hope they change the mats needed for the war effort.
---
"You say you have an account for World of Warcraft? Prove it! Let me see the printed out copy from your records!"
---
Not even being a jerk but it just sounds like he doesn't belong here. No offense but if you want content play retail. Classic players don't want anything rushed to suit neck beards blowing through all the content playing 8+ hours a day. Make an alt if thats what you want. Leveling in classic is enjoyable.
---
Replace "r/ClassicWoW" and replace with "anything", and that's me in a nutshell. I've the tendency to over eagerly help someone when I'm being asked for help, or start rambling about the next greatest thing I'm passioned about, that people usually walk away because they think I'm trying to scam them.
---
Takes up a bag slot though
---
I use my home PTR. I've setup all my keybindings and coordinated them across all characters so they match skill effects.  
---
For example my pummel/shield bash is Shift + R, and so is Counterspell on my mage.  
---
I never bound A and D to strafe, I used Q and E. A and D are rebound to spells.  
---
I don't really need practice moving, but I spend a lot of time walking through instances and relearning all the correct pulls so that when I tank them I know what I'm doing roughly.  
---
I have plans still to mess with retail macros so I can remind myself generally how they behave. Although they won't use the exact same system in Classic, it will be similar enough that messing with BFA's system will help me with familiarity.  
---
I also need to examine each spell on my warrior and decide if that spell would benefit from a macro of some sort.  
---
I have a spreadsheet that is completely packed with little data points that I've observed or tested over the last 6 months.  
---
Well, there was this one called Wagyu. 
---
Most people mistook it for a regular name. 
---
K. Bye.
---
In 1.12 this is not true at all.
---
When were you playing Feenix? I raided in a Horde guild Belligerent. Troll Priest named Juicyj.
---
By taking time off from the 3 years of playing vanilla. :)
---
I’m 90% certain that shield bash can be used in Battle Stance too :)
---
No notice is fine for coordination too. The internet is instant so it doesnt take days to "coordinate". 
---
Druid, all the perks of a rogue but also better 'get outta jail free' cards.  You're also a great force multiplier with battle rez, innervate, and nats swiftness.  
---
I think I'd be a grey earring. 
---
What was the previous update?
---
Okay good to know. Thanks
---
pServers dont die without sharding.
---
Literally! 
---
Jokes aside, I actually enjoy tips videos. Feel free to down vote me for saying that.

You can look here (fire resist column).
---
Some good pieces Pre MC you can get : 
---
volcanic set (3pieces that are easy to craft) 58 fr
---
incendius bracers 10fr
---
Magnus stone (or Skull of Burning Shadows) as an offhand 15fr
---
Drakefire amulet (onyxia quest line) 15fr 
---
Wildfire Cape  20 fr  and +7fr with enchant
---
Flamescarred Girdle 20fr
---
Coal Miner Boots 10fr
---
The bis enchant trinket also give 7fr
---
This give 162fr, you might have to complete with a few green of fire resistance or whatever other dungeon drop you find.
---
If you also have engineering you can craft a trinket and a head that give another 35fr
---
The quest reward for the douse with hydraxians water lord also give a ring with 15fr
---
You can get 2 libram of resilience to enchant legs and head (if you plan to do some brd run, try to get some burning essence from coffer). It give +20fr so +40fr total with 2
---
Once you hit revered with argent dawn, you can get a +5 fr enchant on shoulder.
---
Your first goal should be to get close to 200 fr unbuffed (if your guild is using the fire resist buff from mind controlled mob you need way less). 255 unbuffed (315 with paladin aura) is the end goal.
---
It get easier once you can get a few Thorium brotherhood craft
---
I casually did 1-60 solo on a fury warrior in 2004-2005. It took me one year to hit the level cap (Thanksgiving morning 2005), and I died a lot. I also had very little idea of what I was doing until I was around 52, so it was fantastically difficult. After that, I leveled a priest and took a bit of a different approach by grouping up occasionally, and it was much, much more enjoyable. 
---
Need it because I’m a hunter
---
Let's break this down.
---
You: Classic is only gonna last a year or two before it dies (again) Unless Blizzard starts adding content ... Most pirates didn't even pay a sub fee. I don't see a great future.
---
Me: Pservers have shown that people are interested in continuing to participate in servers where no new content has been added
---
You: Randomly deflects, comparing pservers to Blizz from a business perspective. 
---
So, we're talking about whether people are interested in playing long-term on servers w/no new content added. Empirically, all evidence shows that yes, they are. The actual # is small as many players (again, as evidenced by this sub, the forums, etc) aren't interested in non-official servers for a multitude of reasons. 
---
Great reply! 
---
Shoutout to the blizz employee lurking that also doesn't cater to people here. There's lots of people shouting "no changes" only to later realize that what they're actually asking for is "no changes from private servers" ala the demon respawn mechanic that recently came to light. I'm glad Blizz is listening but also being discretionary.
---
test
---
It doesn't persist through death. But it still make raid easier as long as you don't wipe.
---
So is the purpose of the dragons stopping someone from seeing more of the world of warcraft?
---
&gt;Lots of art things in a video game serve no more purpose than decoration or aesthetics. So you have to argue for what line is drawn at being objectively "superflous."
---
UI design is not a nebulous concept. Being superfluous doesn't stop something from being decorative or aesthetic. No line needs to be drawn.
---
Bullshevik (Bolshevik).
---
Bonus points for harassing female tauren (they exist I swear, get that straight jacket away from me) by singing a variant of "move bitch get out da way" like so: Moo heifer, get out the whey, get out the whey heifer, get out the whey. Never fails to get a groan.
---
Whatever makes you feel better, judging from your posts you need some happiness in ur life :D
---
Can we get a background 
---
Battle.net m8
---
then you don't know shit about the blizzard of old. they no longer have people in charge of making the game what it is who actually want to play the game. blizzard of old made a game they wanted to play
---
those days are gone and they'll never come back. since the heroic nerf in cata where they caved to all the dipshits who are simply not good at the game, which resulted in millions leaving, they've made the same poor decisions over and over
---
wow has been a shitty game longer than it was a good game. 2004-2010 it was a good game made with the original design philosophy and JUST ENOUGH convenience, but since then it's been nothing but change for the sake of change, the worst storytelling of any game i've ever seen along with an elite art team who was the glue that held the game together. 
---
old blizz is dead and it died when bobby kotick started calling the shots. it's never coming back. 
---
CDPR is the new "old blizzard" and one day they'll probably follow the same patch
---
if you are a human warrior, i am needing on it. Otherwise im a good guy, and congratulate you on it.
---
Wow I’m so late
---
I would like them there just so that there isn't an excuse to swing to one faction as far as population. People tend to be followers these days and any excuse and they will pile on one side. 
---
Hunter.
---
&gt; What's the point of releasing tier .5 gear at stage 5 when it's largely going to be useless/non-existant for all but the most casual of non-raiders?
---
Blizzard originally introduced the Dungeon 2 set quests to be the endgame activity for the most casual of non-raiders. Releasing the sets in phase 5 fits with Blizzard's overall goal of achieving high fidelity to the vanilla experience.
---
Need and sell it on the AH and then buy an item or items that I need.
---
Long ago I was in the pass to the warrior camp 100%.  Unfortunately I got burned way too many times as the warrior in this scenario.  So I now just always roll need on BoE epics worth anything as that seems to be WoW culture.  
---
&gt;They clear MC in one third the time. That requires, roughly, three times the DPS anyone ever had in real vanilla. That's, er, implausible.
---
Most of the top classes are doing close to twice or above the DPS of what people did back then. That, paired with optimization can definitely be 3 times faster. Are you basing the numbers being wrong, because of the clear times, or do you have any concrete knowledge or showcase of them being wrong?
---
&gt; Add that all up and it's nothing like a tripling of DPS. Got anything remotely big enough to explain the discrepancy?
---
Being fully buffed for every raid, be that MC or Naxxramas surely helps. Better gear sets. Better understanding of mechanics. Using Zapper Charges. Being overall a better player.
---
&gt; Can we have this discussion in good faith please? "Everything" is an  absurd attempt to move the goalposts. I am saying your friend cannot  possibly be ten feet tall, and you are saying "are you sure you know *everything* about height and nutrition?". I don't need to know everything, just enough to know your claim is implausible. 
---
I don't think you're discussing this in good faith, though. I'm fairly objective on this subject, it just so happens that every person saying some numbers are off on private servers, can't for the life of them show this. I'm genuinely interested in this. And since these people are saying the projects don't seem Blizzlike, I think it's fair to assume they can show what is wrong and what makes people do twice the DPS. You got a project with people claiming they're reverse engineering most things, and you got people like you, claiming the numbers aren't true. I would expect you to be able to show what they've done wrong. 
---
&gt; Okay, explain how this "understanding" triples DPS. 
---
I already did. Understanding of about everything the game throws at you. Be that mechanics. Gear. Stats. Proc chances. And just the possibility of people actually getting better at video games. The average player is much more competitive than back then, and is most likely used to be watching guides for any online game out there. This is the norm nowadays.
---
&gt;"That is a terrible example, because I  can't argue against it and it proves me completely wrong!".
---
It didn't prove me wrong though. To prove me wrong, you would have to back up your claim of private server numbers being off. I'd believe a community driven project with open githubs and 'devs' overseeing people adding commits and then backing it up with reverse engineering, more than you throwing a random "numbers are off" comment. Surely if people are doing over twice the DPS they should, it should be easy to look at spell coefficients or ability scaling and see if something. Especially since these two things have been known and public since Vanilla.  
---
&gt; Also mages and warlocks are still among the top DPS in pirate server  logs as far as I can tell, so it can't be the case the case the more  skill-sensitive classes are the only ones doing more DPS. 
---
I don't think I ever wrote or insinuated any of this. It just so happens that on something like a Feral Druid or Fury Warrior for example, there's a lot more room for error. Spamming Frostbolts or Fireballs is so easy that even 11 year old me probably couldn't fuck that up. Meanwhile something like a Fury Warrior, as we can see in World First videos and other hardcore raiding videos, is something you actually can fuck up and there's probably something which wasn't known back then, which is fishing for procs with GCD spamming abilities. The way you're arguing makes it sound like you think everything was figured out back then. But just this one thing, clearly shows that this isn't true.
---
&gt;Put it this way, suppose I said that on a  truly Blizzlike server I levelled a hunter from nothing to sixty, solo,  in forty hours /played. You'd call bullshit, right? Because no matter  how good I am there is a rock solid floor in terms of how fast you can  run and how fast you can DPS in this game, and no amount of skill can  move that floor one millimetre. Even if I discovered some cool trick  nobody else ever did, it couldn't make that big a difference, right?  
---
&gt;Same deal here. *Something*  is screwy, whether or not the people whose egos depend on pirate server  achievements being legit are emotionally able to admit it.
---
I understand what you're saying. I just don't think that rock solid floor is at 1k DPS or whatever you feel like it's at. A good showcase of this is Feral Druids Powershifting with the helmet, which if done right, can over double your DPS from what it was before that.
---
6 phases instead of 4 is HUGE. But, will they add guild banks? or will the leadership of end game raid guilds be subject to being banned at any moment for account sharing? only time will tell.
---
Esfand is great. I enjoy his Classicast podcast. Those who haven't, go look up the podcasts on his channel with John Staats (level designer dev), Mark Kern (team lead), Kevin Jordan (class &amp; stat dev) and Ythisens (community manager).
---
Unless he is a friend or a close guildie, i will need, wait for 6 months, and sell it for more than 3k gold.
---
I'm gonna need a whole year to reach 60, so I wasn't gonna be affected by the content release plan in any way. But I'm really happy for all you other guys that fought for this, and it's awesome that Blizzard truly seems to be passionate about the project. Can't wait for summer!
---
Enjoy never getting into a raid guild at 60
---
Rogue will be the go to choice for many. It's more straight forward. 
---
2 incredibly powerful and effectively world pvp classes are hunter and druid. They are also the hardest to master due to having higher than average skill caps created by their unique mechanics.
---
You WILL see a high number of good rogues. You WON'T see a high number of great hunters and druids, but the good ones will destroy the majority of rogues and other "popular" pvp classes.
---
Yep. 
---
Need. BoE blues and epics are equivalent to gold, and everyone benefits equally from that gold. I keep seeing this brought up as if it's a scummy move to need, but needing on BoEs like this was understood on my server since early BC at the latest.
---
I have quiet a few Zissou(GoA) members ready to go ham.
---
Need. It's worth the same to everyone since the warrior can farm the gold to buy it.
---
Can we get HD version, Maybe Prints on Etsy would be a good idea too!
---
Added
---
Just a suggestion, oddball sizes REALLY suck to find frames for. Might want to consider making it a standard poster size / ratio.
---
I'm sure they will enjoy it. Needing on BoE blues and epics to sell is not ninja'ing.
---
But the irony of this is that the dungeon quest chain is actually quite challenging with some of the hardest "boss" fights in the game (on a purely dungeon level).  The summoned boss in UBRS along with some of the other requirements actually speak to hardcore personalities.  
---
Overall, I just find it an interesting dichotomy of conflicting results:  A dungeon set that takes someone dedicated enough to collect all the gear, and turn around and upgrade it through a series of very involved/expensive/and somewhat challenging fights.  
---
I just think it's one of those things that was good on paper, but now that we have a 2nd chance at vanilla is something that should be re-evaluated.
---
Ret Paladins: Stack every buff known to man, hack the matrix to get a secret 23rd buff giving them 80% crit, spends literally 8 hours pre-raid preparing buffs, pots, flasks, elixirs, food. 
---
Hunter: rolls out of bed 5 minutes before a raid and still do 3x more damage than the ret.

# The Lazarus Company
---
**Mercenary venture based on DnD**  
---
Four years after the battle of Mount Hyjal, tensions between the Alliance and the Horde begin to arise once more.  
---
Kalimdor, is in the process of colonization by Thrall's new Horde, who have invited the Forsaken into their ranks to establish a foothold in the Eastern Kingdoms.  
---
On that same continent, the human city of Stormwind rises, a nexus for many races and the beating heart of the Alliance.  
---
Here, a mix of common folk, aspiring heroes, and the occasional ruffian gathers, ready to work for their daily bread and leave a mark on the world.  
---
It is a world with endless threats, be it the savage warriors of the Horde or the endless, gibbering masses of the Burning Legion.  
---
Despite it all, the Lazarus Company thrives. Gold and glory is out there - and no obstacle shall come between us and our prizes. 
---
* **Region:** NA
---
* **Play Times:** Varied
---
* **Particular Rule:** Chill atmosphere
---
* **Contact:** [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/UmFhJA6)
---
**Atmosphere**  
---
The Lazarus Company aims to provide a down to earth atmosphere with simpler lore within the Classic timeline.  
---
What does this entail?  
---
\- Outfits should be realistic as possible to the setting at hand. Clothes radiating with colourful magic are not something we will accept.  
---
\- Injury or death might occur. That's not a guarantee, nor a threat, but rather a reality. Stupid actions will lead to stupid consequences. Remember that you are roleplaying as somebody who is living in a world currently at war.  
---
\-There will be a balance between grand scale adventures and casual role play.
---
Question for the theory craft gang:  if there is a debuff limit of 16 from the start, does this change the “strength” of early gear? Are MC &amp; Ony fights made easier?
---
Sounds like a trick question. 
---
I ask the group if it would mind if I roll too, state my reason and then go with what the group thinks. Goes for pretty much any item that's not explicitly on my need list. 
---
That is, unless the group makes it tacitly clear that they all roll need by, well, rolling need, in which case I also roll need without asking. I'd be open to give it to the warrior after the fact, though, if he asks nicely. Making gold is nice, making a friend is nicer. 
---
I hear you but needing as say a Mage when there is a fury warrior in the group is considered bad to me
---
oh no
---
All I remember is that I jumped in on my mate's rogue in an MC raid when he was away. I won a weapon for him and he offered to pay my mount as a thanks. Don't think I got past about level 15 before Wrath probably... Really hated leveling back then haha.
---
milk it is
---
Just take the L and whine less in the future
---
You can disenchant everything with level 1 enchanting in 1.12.1 vanilla WoW. They changed it at some point in TBC or at earliest the TBC pre-patch which is later than patch 1.12.1, not sure.
---
Yeah I think he's just making it up, they didn't mention any of that.
---
I am with you, I think it would be good to have T0.5 earlier and it wouldn't hurt anything. But that's partially because I just love the sets :)
---
These are the two I'm thinking of right now:
---
[Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18986)
---
[Dimensional Ripper - Everlook](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18984)
---
Let me know if you know any others.
---
It makes no difference what class you are, or which BoE even drops for that matter. BoE = gold, everyone should have a fair shot at it.
---
No he equipped his boots of avoidance and dodged the attack. Think with your head man. 🤔
---
Personally I don't think it matters to be honest. He's obviously passionate about it, has a decent following which has gotten him access to some blizzard staff to be a liason. I don't see that as being a negative at all.
---
Is he advocating for things the community doesn't want or something? I haven't seen that 
---
There are several flaws with this line of thinking.
---
1. Alchemy does benefit your character more than tailoring or even engineering. Engineering is only better if you can spend time/money on alchemy consumables *and* engineering consumables. If time/money is limited then ppl always prioritize alchemy consumables. This is the reason why almost all raid guilds require you to bring alchemy consumables and only the most hardcore guilds require you to bring both alchemy and engineering consumables.
---
2. "the most efficient gold farming method for his class" differs drastically from class to class and spec to spec and even the server culture. The Alchemy/Herbalism/Fishing combo is almost completely class/spec agnostic.
---
3. Vendor type farming such as solo dungeon runs can achieve high amounts of g/h but the more ppl do them the higher is gold inflation over time. They are very strong in the earlier phases of a server but start to lose value later on.
---
4. What is profitable and what isn't is highly demand/supply dependand (who would have thought). I know a pserver where Herbalism has become easily the most profitable profession by a landslide. Rare herbs have become incredibly expensive because almost all the non-casual players, who make up for the highest server time, are more often than not engineers or miners/skinners on their farming alts. This lead to Herbs being rare and extremely wanted (see point 1).
---
5. The supply/demand values are very much dependand on server maturity and patch phases. Tailoring (bags) and especially skinning/lw (devilsaur) are typically huge money makers in the early phases but lose value over time, same goes for the less profitable gear crafting professions ofc. Mining is usually very popular so it never makes large amounts but is steady because of consumables. Herbalism in the other hand is increbly steady and usually high value because it less popular and extremely beneficial. But most importantly it should be noted that if you go with the rythm of a server patch cycle you will make more money in comparison to someone who just does X all the time.
---
They're backing on people moving over to release when they inevitably can't deal with the challenge of Classic. They stand to make a great deal of money.
---
Make no mistake. Most of us who intend to raid will not be able to stomach the grind. You yourself could be a quitter. I could be a quitter. 
---
This post is from 174 days ago lol 
---
I think you are going to have a rude awakening but I wish you luck with that!
---
Depends on how you get the mobs.  Sometimes it's "oh, whoops, we aggroed that thing through the wall" or "that was a bad psychic scream".
---
Some idiot runs in front of me and flags himself on purpose. I wouldn't say no to free kill.

Pretty sure it’s gonna be post 1.10 items.

Because nobody wants to fall off Azeroth into the Twisting Nether, obviously.

This is fascinating. It's like experiencing WoW again from the start but they get a chance to do things differently. I wonder if they'd ever re-release Burning Crusade and the rest of the expansions? To be able to walk out into Northrend for the very first time again would be a rush of nostalgia.
---
My thinking is that we won't have itemization.  
---
It puts all of this gear in a really weird spot.  
---
That statement has some truth in it. It really depends on how many people are doing A or B.
---
You’re getting downvotes but you’re right my guy. Esfand at least is kind of likable???? (??? Kinda?) but people like him and “Tipsout” (even his name is cringey as all hell) are milking classic for the money alone. 
---
I’d like them all a lot more if their videos were fewer than 10 mins. So blatantly trying to milk the community.
---
It appeals to the same underaged retail babbs who watch Asmongold and Sodapoppin and it poisons the classic well for the rest of us. 
---
It's also not an official announcement. Have they even ever mentioned that stuff, or did they just ignore it entirely?
---
Nope that wasn't it, it was just a picture of a table really but was based around hours played per day. Thank you though.
---
Yeah, I think that too. Progressive itemization is just so convoluted and confusing, having items change at certain patches, some items changing multiple times. Or the plethora of items that are just useless garbage until they get upgraded in later patches.
---
Would rather just have flat 1.12 itemization on any/all currently available items.
---
Oh shit you’re right. Totally forgot they didn’t exist in vanilla 
---
At least lemme right-click ignore.
---
Convince me why the warrior should have dibs on an item that sells for thousands of gold. I don't think I'm in the minority here, needing on BoEs has been commonplace for a loooong time. Every time I set up a dungeon group I'd clarify in chat that BoEs are fair game and I can't remember once when someone contested that.
---
Shamans have a second hearth. 
---
PSservers launch one  hugely overpopulated server for a reason. PServers also have an order of magnitude less tourists  than classic will no doubt have
---
Might want to add what class/race you're going to be playing. Might make a difference, idk /shrug.

Plenty of player made content and wars for Months and months of entertainment.
---
Need. It doesn't matter if you are a warlock, sought after BoE's in classic are worth too much to just give to a random player, now if it's my close friend or brother maybe we can work out a deal where instead of rolling for it they keep it and pays me half the price for what they would pay on AH or we roll for it fair and square. Random player? We're rolling dice. 
---
Time is money, friend. 
---
If I already have BWL chest and it drops for me again, I should be able to trade it to another guildmate who has been raiding for weeks to get it. The fact that this option didnt exist in vanilla was a major fail of vanilla

It is better to need happiness than to be addicted to something that merely mimics happiness.

I'm going super chill. I don't have time for hardcore playing, so I'm just going to explore the world and focus on the leveling journey.

Right you are Ken
---
Theres about zero chance edgemasters breaks 500. Maybe a 1000 around AQ.
---
Except you will have to raid religiously for gear especially if loot trading isnt a thing. It can take 6 months to fully gear up a toon in a raid with bad luck and no trading
---
I tried. Giant invisible wall is the final boss.
---
How can you be passionate about something you haven’t even experienced lmao? 
---
He doesn’t advocate for anything because he’s trying to appeal to the broad community. He doesn’t know enough to advocate for anything one way or the other. 
---
This dude is the best Vanilla content creator on YouTube.
---
Why are you mad?  I expressed I was annoyed.  Not mad.  If people are allowed to express their support of something, why is it that someone is not allowed to express their dissent of it?  Why is this sub so quick to be hypocritical and downvote TipsOut videos (not that I like the guy that much either) but so quick to upvote this guy?
---
Cause TipsOut never made it to level 38? Who the hell cares.  If he's passionate about it, then anyone saying "You shouldn't be creating content for Classic WoW" is just a gatekeeping asshole, wouldn't you agree?
---
But on the topic at hand, regarding both of them:  Any content video that doesn't do anything besides create a fluff minimalist opinion piece is quite honestly: bullshit.
---
The video is barely over 10 minutes long: the hallmark of an ad revenue video.  It doesn't do anything else other than repeat the blue post (almost verbatim) and then adds very minimal effort beyond 2 minutes of speculated conjecture at what it could mean.
---
I don't have anything against content creators in general; what I do have against content creators is low-hanging fruit videos that have 0 effort put into them.
---
Want an example of a hiqh quality content video?  Watch this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ&amp;)
---
You listed qualities about what draws you to this creator:
---
* *Great Guy*
---
* *Great Humor*
---
* *Classicy attitude (sic) -whatever this means.  I assume this means he is passionate about WoW Classic.*
---
Now, out of those qualities, what makes him stand apart from other content creators or makes him unique?
---
"Great Guy" ....is subjective and honestly isn't really a distinguishing quality in itself.  It's a generalization that is the complete opposite of "unique"
---
"Great Humor".  Shouldn't most content creators have a sense of humor?  Of course some will have more than others, but humor as a defining quality for a content creator seems to be more of a requirement at being a content creator in the first place, not a defining quality that sets you apart from the rest.
---
"Classicy attitude" (i.e. passionate I'm assuming).  -  Nearly everyone in this subreddit is passionate about WoW.  You're probably just as passionate as me.    So this is also not a defining characteristic in this context.
---
Overall, it's just re-hashing a blue post, from "yet another content creator".  It's nothing personal against this particular creator: but if you're going to just create a short video to say "hey I'm alive, and I just saw this blue post too!" it's much better to go the CGPGrey route, and create quick 2-5 minute videos.  
---
These signify your excitement, keep your community engaged, but don't shout "I made this video JUUUST long enough to generate ad revenue, even though it took me literally no time at all to make!"
---
See where I'm coming from? 
---
If the Warrior intends to equip, then IMO they should go to him.  I don't buy the justification that *"BoEs = Gold therefore everyone gets a chance,"* to me it seems like a flimsy way to justify your literal **greed** over a literal **need**.
---
Having said that, I would simply defer my roll to see what everyone else did.  I realize I'm in the minority in this way of thinking, so I'd probably end up forced to roll Need just because everyone else in the party did.  But in the event that I won them, if the Warrior truly intended to equip them, I would trade them to him for free 100% of the time.
---
Maybe I'm naive and will get burned doing this.  But that doesn't mean I still don't think it's the right thing to do.
---
i bet you play a warlock
---
Rip shaman/druid relics.
---
worth it

Anyways I was just fucking around with you bub, you need to work on relaxing a bit. No need to be so upset over a video game community. I'll take my pick as wanting to jump in to the circle jerk and watch the shit devolve. We could sit down for coffee and probably become friends, I am usually less of a fuckhead, but I feel like letting the shit-post reign free for awhile. Anyways who'd want to sit down with someone as brain dead as I? A lowly scum who crawled out of his sisters vagina with no idea in the world but to follow, but if only you really knew me friend... if you only knew. Also I got $20 for the first post, don't tell anyone.
---
Since I got my PC built I've been goofing off on sub level 20 characters on my retail account for free. Getting used too a new keyboard and setting binds etc. After a 4 year break from PC gaming it's a bit of a trip. 
---
Second this.
---
How hard is it to get that set? It's my favourite. 
---
And still 2x less than a DPS warrior who just wanted to try a different spec for a change.
---
Wait that is actually a great idea. I will from now on tell my groups that every should roll need on valuable BoE. This way noone can trick the system. How is this not standard etiquette?
---
Hi, /u/Gothlander
---
No lol. Most loot councils dont give tanking gear to fury warriors over 3rd string tanks.
---
I'm reading the comments here and everybody seem super happy. 
---
Am I the only one who was looking forward to classic being patched like vanilla?
---
I'm honestly not surprised but I am sad now that it's firmly confirmed that they are going to patch much more similar to priv server than vanilla.
---
I mean he spent years on private servers. He has more exp than 90% of this sub.
---
Rogues, Hunters and Druids are the kings of wpvp. 
---
I leveled my character to 60, expecting to get the greatest joy from epic raids and battles. Turns out the most fun was just exploring Azeroth, fishing and sight seeing. I had more adventures just being immersed in the world than any other game.
---
...and our next contestant, Babaganoush! He's our deli guy who brings us sandwiches.
---
You could have a member of the opposing faction kite your innkeeper wherever and then set your hearth there. My hearthstone was in front of molten core for quite a while.
---
The later gear changes and improved options for BoE pre-BIS come later. Pvp gear set changes have yet to be confirmed yet as stated.
---
I can only imagine at this point that the stat progression will reflect more like it does on private servers.
---
I thought he played? Just didn't hit level cap?
---
And you can be passionate about something you yourself haven't participated in... hence professional sports selling out giant stadiums on a nightly basis lol. All 50,000 spectators aren't ex-players. 
---
In hockey for example there are lots of well respected journalists / pundits who never played... Elliot Freidman and Bob McKenzie are two of the big ones who are universally respected but did not play at all. They are very passionate about the sport.
---
You say he doesn't advocate anything but I have seen him advocate against right click reporting, 4 tiered content release, no sharding etc. I agree with him on all these points. 
---
What kind of changes happened with itemization?
---
Are there any specific items you have in mind?
---
I loved those conflict zones. They genuinely made the world feel so big and dangerous.
---
*Does it though?*
---
To quote a great man:
---
&gt; It's still not better than just having an extra mage
---
there are some graphical upgrades, but those are optional. Water and foliage are the only things affected I believe
---
Aside from not at all, really...
---
...looking up a Jew high stam, mail armor SP gear list for my shaman to world PvP with prior to raids, and with raid drops in mind.
---
I want world PvP man...
---
It depends on the raid boss. [This is my guilds 4H kill on retail vanilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUzWiQF1fMg&amp;t=1s), look at dmg meters at end of fight. I even managed to get #10 on Patchwerk and that fight is considered the ultimate melle fight. 
---
Also warlocks were always easy to beat in damage.

Like xfire skins!

Hey, whats your discord?

I got mine as close to Blackrock Mountain as possible. I paid an Alliance mage to help me with it after I learned about it on mmowned.

It's from Molten Core so it's pretty easy. Just need to hope the RNG gods are on your side when loot drops lol

I'm interested to see where this can lead, such as later on down the line some new Phase 1 servers go through the progression. Unless it's gonna just get to 6 and then sit there forever unchanged.
---
So, who still thinks blizz gonna put sharding everywhere?
---
Druid struggles a lot against classes with high sustain. They don't have the dps to kill them. Warlock/Priest/Pally are the main ones. There's not much point ganking them as a druid unless you're 3+ levels higher than them.

Everybody whose a sports fan has played the sport at one point in their life. You don’t need to be a pro to be a fan. But you at least need to have had *some* raiding experience in Vanilla to earn an “influencer” (yuck) spot. The dude doesn’t even meet the bare minimum.

Okay so he advocates what the community wants, but you said he doesn't advocate anything. Now he's just a poser.

Sounds like you don't like him for personal reasons, not the content he's creating.

Essential development time and resources have been granted to this incoming failure of a project (just try play on a vanilla server and remove your nostalgia googles, this game is unfinished at best) when retail is in dire need of rework.

[Leaked footage of entering the Dark Portal](https://youtu.be/DKutw1zDgms?t=5)
---
TIL I always used the American version 
---
All those changes were because Blizzard was actively creating the game. It's not something which is a fundamental part of a game.
---
Classic is not Vanilla. It's not a new MMO. It's an old game brought back. It's finished, it's done. Any change should only aim to bring it closer to what it was (and fix bugs, of course).
---
You should be able to go back to it at any time and find it just as you left it.
---
What about people who'll start playing it a year from release? Two? Three? As said, if it's changed, then they can't play Vanilla and they can justifiably call for its reinstatement.
---
Also as said, I don't think Blizzard is that stupid (hopefully :).
---
Advocating and mindlessly echoing what the majority says is very different. I guess the nuance is lost on someone like you. Can’t help you there, buddy. 
---
Lolooolooloooooooollloloololol
---
IIRC you kept the title but could only buy gear based on your current rank.  I had a Warrior hit GM in my guild and he bought all the weapons even though he only used swords and maces, just in case they changed a talent to make polearms better at a later date 
---
BRD AoE farming as mage. Mara for Hunter and warlock.
---
The mage BRD farm has a pretty steep learning curve, super fun after that, until you lag for 2 seconds and just die.
---
The question is did Blizzard keep the information from previous patches. For example I've seen people asking if itemization changes will also be reflected, or even if not, if that is information Blizzard even has on hand.
---
The problem with this is you've already admitted needing and then working it out afterwards is a perfectly viable strategy. So if that's true, greeding - and then just crossing your fingers that everyone else (who doesn't need) will greed as well, is actually just inviting people to ninja it and cause drama. So by doing the 'right' thing all you're actually doing is causing drama that can easily be avoided by another system (everyone needs and then the winner can voluntarily give it to someone who needs if they feel like it). So no, it's not the right thing to do, even though it might make you feel better about yourself. You're just setting yourself and others up to fail. Everyone needs on valuable BoE is by far the fairest and most logical way to do looting.
---
Figures. I'm glad for the content release change and am more than happy to change my pre-bis plans to accommodate xD
---
At the end of the day the message the community wants to get to blizzard is getting to blizzard, and look - today they announced the 6 tiered content release - something he's advocated for. 
---
I don't understand the negativity. Who cares? Vanilla wow is like 15 years old, there are lots of great content creators who were too young to even game back then. Big deal.
---
What do you want all the WoW classic content creators to be old balls like myself?

---
I agree. its also rather insensible for absolutists to reeee about that being a thing... "no changes" at the start is just bad.  
---
We have to look at the cold hard facts. In real classic launch there were maybe a million players? less than that most likely and STILL the servers were borked. During the first year they gained like 2 million players and had to expand their server capacity alot before they recovered.  
---
In this new iteration there will most likely be solid 5-10 million at launch no doubt...  that wont last for long but it will still be a thing, and the starter zones will suffer the most from it.  
---
The launch would literally be the worst mmo launch of all time if they didnt do phasing in the starter zones. I think there still might be trouble once players get out of the first zones but we will see.  
---
So option A, we have sit around for 5 mins having a D&amp;M about needs and entitlement before everyone needs (or someone greeds and then someone else needs and hearths out), or option B - we see BoE and everyone hits need and continue on the run without a problem. Hmm which is better...
---
From my experience this isn't true. As a miner you can just spend more time grinding mobs in caves, which is less /played spent on leveling anyways than pure questing. There are guides and addons which can help you to actively get to areas/routes that are ore rich.
---
Doing professions while leveling has a bad rep because ppl only passively do them while focussing on quests or even dungeon runs to get that shiny blue drop they will vendor next week. I personally became a huge fan of profession focussed, pure grinding. Pure grinding is already good for making gold while leveling because you vendor in much larger stacks and in terms of /played because you minimize travel time. On top of that it is extremely convenient and self directed. Most people just don't enjoy it as much.
---
It's a catch up mechanic. Also, something most people are ignorant of is that the summoned bosses drop a lot of new pre-bis and some items they drop are BiS until AQ40 and even Naxx.
---
One example is [[Scepter of Interminable Focus]](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=22329) which is 3rd best absolute BiS, only outclassed by two offhands one from Twin Emps in AQ40 and the other from Saph in Naxx.  
---
So 0.5 is far from "literally useless," it's just that people are ignorant of what it's supposed to be (catch up mechanic and easy gearing for newcomers through summoned bosses).
---
Hello everyone, glad to see you made it down here into the comment section.
---
This here is a good example of what we call a wrong opinion. These types of opinions crop up all the time on reddit, and this aubreddit is no exception!
---
Always take note of the derogatory tone and delivery of these types of posts. Aptly enough, being very confontatious is a very poor way of convincing any audience to a controversial topic.
---
Take note and learn from OP's mistake. sharding is bad and its a cheap fix to a bigger problem acti/blizz is choosing as a company. Its not a developer decision  to go "hey, let's purposely have sub par hardware that can't handle vanilla level of populations on our servers. Granted day 1 server load is a limited and extreme circumstance, it in itself is an extremely important social event that would he totally ruined by sharding.
---
np
---
It's selling for 6k on my private server and AQ isnt open yet.
---
Lol you clearly never played vanilla, OP and i'm glad you're not making decisions for Blizzard. Good luck trying to 'rush' 1-60 without any social interactions. If i see you in game i will spawn camp you repeatedly
---
Given my experience, Horde is much more of an instigator.
---
Plenty for casters. +Spell damage was almost non-existent. Check out the Omnicast Boots pre and post itemization.
---
Mages have spell hit in their spec tree. This makes mages better overall. That being said Warlocks are still amazing and in demand. In fact warlock will be in higher demand then mage as way more mages are normally leveled then supply demands.
---
So BRD will be viable farming in classic? I thought I read it only worked on private servers because mobs didn’t cast some net they are supposed to or something.
---
Forgive my ignorance.
---
After reading your guys comments I have turned over a new leaf and will now mindless slam my head on my left mouse button on any purple item 
---
Hi, /u/Lothric
---
I would like named after the Bronze dragon flight members, something like Chromie and Norzdomu.  
---
I mean, with loot trading, every item is a BoE within the group. So just need on everything? 
---
I guess that explains why loot trading is such a big issue with people. 
---
With Blizzard recent decade track record? Absolutely.
---
1-20 sharding is fine, if you've ever played on a private servers you'll know why. Such a stupid anti-classic experience for every mob to be dead.
---
Lots of items had their stats changed throughout vanilla.
---
Examples being the patch 1.4 (or was it 1.5?) change which increased the amount of spell damage / healing on items across the board, or individual items getting changed stats, such as the chest and off-hand from Emperor getting +heal added to them.
---
Wait. Did they say they will be adding Battlegroups in Vanilla?
---
There are inherent drawbacks to server only BGs. This is why private mega servers exist. They exist because they have no cross server tech on their core and enough players need to exist to support healthy BG participation. 
---
If cross server BGs exist, I hope it's a very small cross over for groups of pvp servers. Pve realms could have a larger pool.
---
Hopefully Blizzard finds a good balance. But I must warn, it is likely that for every 1 person who prefers server only BGs, there will be many more complaining about it eventually if servers have a cap far less than 4k. 
---
Hell maybe Blizzard can put out more than 2 server rule sets if there is enough interest. Other games have done just that many times.
---
You should play Ele Shammy or Boomkin.
---
If the populations are 5k+ this won’t be a problem. Also it’s a good bet that even if this was a possible addition it would not be added until far after single-realm bg’s had been a failure.
---
Devilsaur leather will probably be a no go. So many people want it and they are all gearing up at the same time I'm sure it wont be worth it to farm unless your only playing at off hours.
---
You don't need it but it helps. If the healer doesn't have to stop and drink every pull the runs go quicker and every one has more fun. 
---
Plus a bigger mana pool means there's less chance of wiping when the fury warrior pulls extra mobs because they don't understand what the actual tank is doing. 
---
Having been the guild leatherworker in the past there is no way I want a guild profession again. I'm running engineering and mining myself. Pure personal gain this time
---
&gt;"Phase 5
---
&gt;Dungeon loot reconfiguration: Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes"
---
This just pertains to item drops, not the stats on them. T0.5 gear did not exist until patch 1.10, neither did relics, and in 1.10 lots of drop rates on epic dungeon items were increased.
---
Alch / Herb is by far the most profitable two professions in Vanilla WoW.
---
Whatever argument you have for "farming" gold, you simply add the value of Alch / Herb on top of that = **significantly more profit**
---
You don't run around Azeroth gathering herbs. You pick the dreamfoil you run into, any Black Lotus you might come across or not, whatever.
---
Then that "350g for his efforts" farm? You can easily buy the mats you're so willing to pay for on the AH, turn them into consumes, and make **BIG GOLD**.
---
Even on +2 year old Vanilla servers, the absolute consistent money maker is **Alch + Herb.**
---
Even after everyone is geared, early in the server, late in the server, always there is a market for Alch + Herb.
---
Plus the people with the MOST money are the big guilds which have thousands of thousands of gold in their banks. And where does that gold go? Into consumes.
---
And who is gonna sell those consumes? **The smart people that go Alch + Herb.**
---
Your hammer on the head of the nail accuracy is scary. Well summed up.
---
"take the L"? it's my opinion. what a pissy sub.
---
I will put Money down they will not be available until whatever content stage PvP rewards are, as they themselves are.
---
This will undoubtably have huge repercussions in wpvp where say rogues won't be able to break fear, or warlocks and priests will be far more susceptible to stunlocks, while mages will have a very easy time keeping people sheep'd.
---
If blizz decides to make an exception for the PvP insignia trinkets, then that would be an understandable exception.
---
&gt; note of the derogatory tone and delivery
---
&gt; here is a good example of what we call a wrong opinion
---
Phew lad, the irony. Also, saying that Blizzard is taking the "cheap" option by doing sharding shows that you don't understand its purpose. Sharding is there so Blizz can raise the populations caps really high in anticipation of tourists leaving.
---
I would like a compromise since cross-realm bgs was in vanilla. I would cross-realm bgs only on 2 days per week (something like a Friday night PVP event).
---
The reason I am pro-cross realm bg somewhat is community matters more for PVE than PVP. PVP is competing and knowing you are the best player in your region/world. People won't be satisfied knowing they are the best on their server. They will want to push further and see how far they can go.
---
I wonder how much of this is just nostalgia.
---
I’ll try it out for sure - but those early days I was much younger and had more time on my hands 
---
Welcome to the family. 
---
Good to hear! The more people that do that the less drama and the easier pub runs will be. If you really are an amazingly altruistic person as you claim then you can just trade it whoever you want for free if you win anyway so worst case it will be exactly the same as if you greed and win.
---
&gt; Most of the top classes are doing close to twice or above the DPS of what people did back then. That, paired with optimization can definitely be 3 times faster. Are you basing the numbers being wrong, because of the clear times, or do you have any concrete knowledge or showcase of them being wrong?
---
You keep trying to shift the burden of proof.
---
Player A is mashing frostbolt in 2006. Player B is mashing frostbolt on a pirate server using different software in 2019 and doing two to three times the damage. Because clear times are a third what they were in 2006 on a real vanilla server, and mages are still among the top DPSers.
---
Nothing you have thrown at the wall comes remotely close to explaining this. You waffle on with vague remarks like "Gear. Stats. Proc chances" with no specifics, which is like trying to explain a ten foot tall person by saying "food, health, biology".
---
And you keep repeating that this huge mass of code is open source and community driven as if this proves something. Flat earth beliefs are open source and community driven and they are totally fucking wrong. If you tell me your friend is ten feet tall and I am skeptical, and you add "oh yeah the ruler we used was open source and community driven" that doesn't make your claim more convincing or shift the burden of proof.
---
Suppose I showed you a video from 2006 of a level one tauren hunter with the starter weapon doing ten damage with an autoshot  to a level one yellow plainstrider (or whatever, I have no idea what the real figure is). Then I showed you a video of a level one tauren hunter with the starter weapon on a pirate server doing thirty damage to the same mob. You'd know something was fucky, right? And you'd know that anyone trying to tell you that you must be wrong and you're debating in bad faith unless you debug their code for them is trying to shift the burden of proof and being a hypocrite, right?
---
&gt; It didn't prove me wrong. though. I just thought it was a terrible example, as I was talking about not only having better gear sets, but also playing the classes/specs better, and you come up with the two most braindead 'rotations' there is in the game. 
---
That's why it's an extremely strong example that destroys your argument and why you have to find excuses to handwave it away. It *can't* be greater skill if there is no scope for greater skill. It *can't* be better gear if real vanilla players had spreadsheets based on real vanilla logs to tell them what gear was best. And it *can't* be something specific to high-skill-ceiling classes because the "brain dead" classes have got just as much of a boost.
---
So what the fuck is it that lets them do triple the damage? That's your job. To explain triple the damage. Not to find some tiny detail or purely vague and purely hypothetical factor like "more and better knowledge" that could account for a 1% difference at most and declare yourself the victor.
---
You can wave your hand at a huge mass of computer code that *maybe* a few people in the world at most fully understand and demand critics debug the whole goddamn thing without any access to a real vanilla server for reference and prove exactly what is wrong, but that's an absurd demand. Frankly, it's highly likely *tons* of things are wrong, and given open source code the pirate server community has seized on the wrongest things and exploited them to the greatest degree possible.
---
&gt;Classic is not Vanilla. It's not a new MMO. It's an old game brought back. It's finished, it's done. 
---
Except for the fact that it wasn't finished. Even the original devs have said that. 
---
By your own argument there the game was finished on release. Anything but version 1.0 is changes and is unacceptable. 
---
What if someone bought the game at release and stopped playing before the first patch? Don't they have a right to play the game they bought and remember as it was?

Found a torrent for s1-4, lets see how it is.

I did the same thing, mainly because that's what I liked in D&amp;D and I thought I could just do that in WoW - the archetype of the sword and board fighter. I was too big of a noob, and knew too few people while levelling early on, so I never noticed I could do other things. 
---
I found it easy enough, I was able to take more punishment I guess. By the time I hit the 30s and started running dungeons I knew enough about what I was doing and kept levelling all the way to 60 with a shield.
---
It wasn't until I was well into 60 and started pvping that I really understood what stance dancing was and what I had actually done from level 1-60. I still look back on that fondly.
---
Everyone says that levelling warriors is the most painful class, but I guess I was having too much of my own fun to notice.
---
Remember when people killed people just to kill people? Man, TM vs SS  
---
I think you are being obtuse on purpose. :)
---
Vanilla WoW is a historic game. It was first released in 2004 and stopped existing in 2007, with the release of TBC. You can't go back into the past to play it. So Blizzard recreates it as Classic. But it's a recreation of something that was (in 2004-2007).
---
I think I've explained plenty clearly of what I think. You are free to disagree but I won't try to "win" an argument with you. I'm not interested in that.
---
New idea:
---
Create a character named ***inchina*** solely for this purpose.
---
Another reason to give us honor and rep gear. It will give incentive to lowbies to pvp.
---
Have you tried wowhead (formerly thottbot)? You can also use the archive to browse thottbot.com from 2006 but it's slow and sometimes you find dead pages.  
---
BUt i'm pretty sure Wowhead is using data from the old thottbot.  
---
NPC's won't talk to you if another player is clicking on them so everybody will have to line up and wait for their turn to get the quest and hand it in.
---
I'm against sharding as much as the next person.  I think there are better ways to deal with high populations in the starting zones.  
---
Tips comes off as a person with little to no integrity, he seems like a slimy person. Esfand seems like a stand-up genuine dude. Tips has clickbait and very slapped together content. It's really no contest whose videos i'd rather watch.
---
Not quite a pun, but I played on a private server with a lot of Chinese players.  One guy was named Niuroubao (牛肉包) which means beef buns!
---
As someone intending to roll warlock, I could not care less. I prefer Classic to follow a proper content pathway than my selfish need for a 100% mount.
---
And waters wet, but whats it got to do with the price of tea in Pandaria?
---
Ah yes, catch up mechanics where i have to do long quests and multiple dungeons just to get gear that's (in 90% of cases) worse than DM drops. Let alone the fact ZG/MC/BWL that are just run for shiggles by AQ release and guilds happily take any new 60 along for free gear. Super good catch up mechanic.
---
I personally think it's really unrealistic they don't have complete version control of all the code and DB dumps of every major patch, as a lot of the stats and spell values are kept in DB instead of the code itself. But again... Blizzard was not a small indie company making their first game. They are only a small indie company today. ;)

Looking for a guild with a late (US) west coast raiding time.  Played Vanilla on the east coast as a Hunter/Priest.  Casual Guild cleared through Huhuran (Bee boss in AQ.)
---
Have since moved to Hawaii so my available times don't sync well with my old buddies (not sure if many are coming back anyway.). Interested in a slightly more competitive guild, with raids hopefully starting between 7:30-9:30 PST, earlier is fine on weekends (I have a 7-4 job and get home around 5 Hawaii time, about 7-8 PST.)
---
Open to playing different roles, prefer (in no particular order) Warrior (Tank/OT/DPS), Warlock, Hunter or Druid.  Ideal situation is competitive guild/competent guild but not stressed about racing through content, mature but laid back approach.
---
Raid experience is MC/BWL/ZG full clears as Hunter/Priest and AQ40 through Bee as Hunter.  Also played Druid through all content in WoTLK.  Been playing on private servers the last month or two just trying to figure out what class I wanr to play.  PM me via Reddit if you have some slots!
---
I would always find the best way to get a tank is to make your add kinda funny. So instead of just linking "LF1M TANK SFK!" I would link something more like...
---
"COME ONE COME ALL TO AN ADVENTURE OF A LIFE TIME. COME AND BRAVE THE DARKLING HALLS OF SHADOW FANGS KEEP. COME WITH ME LAD AND BRAVE PERILS NOT SEEN SINCE THE RISE OF NARALAX AND HIS NIGHTMARES! COME WITH ME IF YOU DARE, ARUGAL SAY'S HELL BE WAITING WITH YOUR MOTHER ON THE TOP FLOOR!! FOR REAL HE SAID THAT!! ARE YOU JUST GONNA TAKE THAT LIKE SOME BITCH?! HELL NO STOP SHAMING YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR WARCHIEF AND GET YOUR ASS IN HERE AND TANK THIS. BEFORE HE'S PLOWING ALL OUT MOTHERS!!!... lf1m tank sfk"
---
I personally don't think cross realm BGs will be that bad if the battlegroups are very small.  
---
With a pool of 2-3 servers, you can still see people regularly and form rivalry.

Rather than uselessly commenting "this", you should try adding something to the thread.  If you agree with someone's comment, simply upvote them.
---
Rep grind, dungeon grind, quests, gold farm, wpvp, fill out bis etc. This stuff doesn’t take a week like it does in retail
---
i cant wait to play this... i never got deep into vanilla back in the day. i had T0.5 on my warlock when BC droped so i missed a lot of it. i worry about finding a guild that i can experience all this with however, getting 40 guys together isnt easy.    i think ima roll a healer or tank, not sure which tho
---
Which is not reflective of what a classic server economy will look like at all. There will be a lot more horde guilds and alliance guilds wont be running fucking 12 fury warriors. Not to mention there will be a significantly larger leveling base and edgemasters will see far more drops as a result.
---
They didn't stack in vanilla.
---
If they do add xrealm bgs (which I hope they dont) then I'd hope they would only link like 2 servers together. The fewer the better.
---
It sounds good so far, and it probably will be good for the first year or so, but they can't protect it forever.
---
I know for a fact that Wowhead data currently on classic stuff is wrong. Not all the quests for zones are in and a lot of the quest data very inaccurate.
---
Yup. If a BOE epic caster item dropped, that same warrior is free to roll need, sell it, and buy Edgemaster's.
---
I'm sorry you never had a dad when growing up. You seem like you need some encouragement and love.
---
HOORRY SHIEEEEET

**Eminence** \[NA\] \[H\] \[PST\] is now recruiting for our hardcore Horde Classic Raiding guild! Here at Eminence we are all about preparation and organization to meet our classic wow goals! If you’re like us the hype levels are in overdrive and you’re busying yourself daily with everything possible to make sure you’re ready for classic already… so why not lock down a raid spot in a great community and progression-oriented guild too?
---
A little bit about Eminence? The guild is run by a smaller group Friends who have grown up gaming together along with a couple friends we’ve made along the way. All of us have high level experience across multiple games in addition to WoW, holding top percentile ranks in LoL, Overwatch, Halo, PoE, and others.
---
Eminence’s Officer core is extensively experienced in ALL of classic Vanilla Warcraft, both leading and clearing ALL content from release up to Naxx, as well as high US ranked clears of many tiers of retail WoW between WotLK and Legion. Currently members are still regularly active on pservers. Our discord is always active with people playing misc games and getting to know each other better while we build up our roster for launch!
---
**Loot:**
---
Eminence will be using a EPGP loot system that rewards all raiders fairly for their effort towards the team’s success. More info on exactly how our loot system works can be found on our Website Forums or you can contact Redrick through discord.
---
**Recruitment: (Experienced and Dedicated Warriors Needed!)**
---
We are currently recruiting people who are looking to join a Hardcore Raiding Guild/Community and want to get on board early with us during our building phase going into classic! We are a guild who WILL be #1 on the realm we settle on once classic releases. We will be rolling on a PVP realm on the Horde side while aiming for a medium population server. We are looking for dedicated and prepared individuals or groups of people who share the same mindset towards WoW that we do.
---
What exactly are we talking about? Eminence is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience to join us on the path to achieving them. We take raiding seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in between.
---
Overall we are looking for people with DEDICATION and PASSION for classic wow and mastery of their class(es). Chances are if you’re in here reading and made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild this early, you’re the type of person we’re looking for. A lack of high level experience isn’t a deal-breaker but it’s definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail wow experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding Experience.
---
The goal is to build a tight-knit and reliable team of like-minded, committed individuals who want to put maximum effort forth clearing content on the cutting edge and establishing ourselves as a premiere raiding guild. If you are interested in applying or would like to learn more about us please visiteminenceclassic.enjin com
---
We are looking for dedicated Tanks especially, all people of skill should apply (through website or through us on discord). We are 30+ members strong!
---
Raid days and times (subject to minor changes)
---
Tuesday - 6:00-9:30pm PST
---
Wednesday- 6:00-9:30 PST
---
Sunday - 6:00-9:30 PST (cleanup day/ Onyxia if not weekly resets)
---
For more information you can add me or one of my recruitment officers on discord, we would love to chat!

Simple, very noob question that I can't seem to find a clear answer to. Never had a chance to play during vanilla for various reasons so I'm wanting to dive in and just curious about a few mechanics as far as skills and talents go - obviously I have to actually learn my new spells and such from a trainer. Are there limits on how many of these skills you can get in a given tree or in total? I know certain spells are more useful or less useful depending on the spec I want to play but is there anything stopping me from learning everything the trainers have to offer other than money?
---
Damn, all I feel is hype right now. 
---
Man you were full decked out!
---
Oh we are just talking about sunder + EA, those didn't stack on the server I played on. Everything else should stack though right? And bosses will have 3700 armor so they'll basically be reduced to ALMOST zero anyway
---
But how much gold could your main have earned in the time it took you to level up the mage?
---
Fishing, farming rare materials and patterns for crafting and selling on the auction house was where much of my non-raiding time went.  Even farming dragon whelpling pets while skinning for dragon scales was an enjoyable past time.  I also continued to level alts to try out different race and class combinations and thoroughly enjoyed doing the class quests that took you all over the world.  Shaman totem quests, druid form quests and even Rogue quests to get backstab and sap were really fun.  I was so disappointed when they were removed.
---
Also, you know, social things? Playing with friends/guildies. Guilds in vanilla are/were usually much more social and probably will be again
---
The same private servers that have admitted adjusting drop rates as they are winging it? Yeah strong reference.
---
Now the question is will Lupos be op.
---
I think it will be interesting to see how blizzard handles DM. It 100% needs to be nerfed and will ruin the economy if left in un-nerfed. Which is why on private servers it's normally nerfed. Same with tribute run farming. It will be interesting to see how blizzard handles that.
---
Now just cross your fingers they figure out that we dont want sharding on servers in any way. 
---
How bout i'll respond however the fuck i want to. And you'll sit there and deal with it.
---
Someone type out brief summary of the news for me pls.
---
Yep except i hated that gun, but it was the best i had at the time.
---
Ah right, but you could wear the gear no matter what rank you were once you’d bought it? 
---
I had noticed the subs steadily rising so I investigated and found this and thought you guys would like to see :)
---
You don't understand how ranking works in vanilla.
---
Maybe read up on it before suggesting something ?
---
For the Horde!
---
If classic won't have megaservers which it likely won't have then crossrealm battlegrounds are the only way to prevent people from not queueing for bg's because they only run into the same premade anyway. It's healthy for the game to have them. They were a solution to a problem classic had that's far beyond just convenience.
---
It’s a mixture of challenge and personality type for sure. Most dislike it I guess

---
Macros for the macro api that hasn’t been released yet? That would be a good trick.
---
When I was in fifth grade the trick was to get my dad hooked on it too so I wouldn't have to pay for it
---
What a great idea - you get yours first then :P
---
A lot of people used a lot of consumables in vanilla. I was in a casual guild and everyone was potted up, we just weren't all flasked (just the tank and a few other people who had them and used them if they wanted). Using consumables was pretty common, if not the usual, in vanilla.
---
What we didn't do was use world buffs. The frequency of world buffs are different on private servers than they were in classic so we won't see them as much.
---
dragon scales, elemental essences, arcanite crystals, dark iron ore, herbs used for flasks, firefin snapper, crusader orbs, living essence....  i'm sure there are lots more but those are the ones I remember most from pre-DM.
---
2010-2015.
---
On various characters in &lt;Pure Luck&gt;/&lt;Argent Crusade&gt;/&lt;Resurrection Gaming&gt;/&lt;Work in Progress&gt;
---
You couldn't be more wrong
---
I know most people here want "classic wow" not "vanilla wow" but I'm still fucking disgusted by the idea of sharding in classic. 
---
Let there be a bit of a cluster fuck in the beginning. Peoples' PCs are for sure better than 15 years ago so that's not the problem. It's the population and server lag that is going to be a "problem". A problem which I'm looking forward to. Or it's not classic for me. It'll be more like fkn retail...
---
Love the content! Keep up the great Classic coverage! :)
---
6 phases. Dire maul not in at launch. And pvp rewards are tbd
---
To be clear I am on the you should need it team. That being said if I had to make an argument on behalf of warrior I would say this. Playing a caster is super cheap and easy and, they also farm ultra well. As a mage or warlock you should never be in a state where you "need" gold. They live spoiled privileged lives. Needing on it is like being a well off millionaire. Taking from a social saftey net. It's technically allowed but it is still a little selfish and dickish.
---
All that being said. We ain't friends son. Imba need them bracers and, givem to my brother or warrior friend I value. Who will now "value" me all the more. 
---
No chance.  
---
I miss those days 😭
---
Not their fault that you bought a Mac. Less than a decade old PCs can still play the retail client.
---
But you spend almost no time in instances while levelling compared to how much time you spend soloing. A levelling mage will use that robe for literally everything they do between SFK and BFD and probably beyond that for all I know, the dick druid will put it in their bank and never use it until they run BFD once and then probably vendor it.
---
Maybe that one BFD run will be slightly quicker because they have a +9 intellect chest instead of +5 but I don't believe for one second you'd notice the difference.
---
This will be a giant failure with no graphic update
---
Subreddit* confrontatious* (ps this is not a word)

---
Blizzcon was a very busy day.  
---
I don't know all that much about this but wouldn't the warrior benefit more from a 2H in PVP? The hunter only hits with it every once in a while in PVP I'd assume, while the warrior uses it as his main weapon. So to me it would seem like the warrior would get more out of the 2H than the hunter, although it's still important for both.
---
Not trying to be contrarian just confused, honestly, because it seems like it would be more useful for the warrior.
---
The 25 % resist chance of stuns from the orc is like the best PvP perk existing in Vanilla. Keep that in mind. I hated playing against orcs
---
They’ve already said they’re going with the 1.12 talents
---
All these people saying rogue really don't have a clue. Druids are the real GODS in world pvp.
---
only for the US guys - its basically the US guys enforcing their will on other players, which is horseshit when the PS servers are EU run.
---
Yes, they said that when they also planned to have Dire Maul out at launch, but i read through the update post twice and no mention of talents. The question is, do you think they may have changed their minds on talents just as they did on patch progression?
---
That’s my goddamn point, doofus. That a system which was perfectly find playing Legion on ultra graphics now can’t even install the downgraded version of the same game.
---
It is 100% their fault I can’t play any more because they are the ones choosing not to port to non-metal Macs. Any Mac post mid-2011 is perfectly capable of playing Battle for Azeroth and Classic.
---
I can play Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, Hearthstone... but WoW post-Legion? Nah, Blizzard cut that $10 a month.
---
Do some fucking research before you run your bias in this house.
---
Granted I only played on a single server, but I was in one of the two absolute top raiding guilds on my server and we only used resistance pots basically. And of course mana pots etc.
---
Seeing elixirs and things like stoneshield, etc, was extremely rare.
---
Correct
---
I would love X-realm bg's for any que longer then 5 minutes. I love the idea of non-xrealm Bg's but at the same time. I don't have 45 minutes to just wait in a que.
---
That's because of VAT and nothing else.
---
The correct answer is NEED - no need to think about it more than that. I'm all for playing as a team but that item in particular is worth having to reroll.
---
As long as I can build a 19 Twink Rogue for BG when it releases, I’m golden. I was never invested enough to get to 60, but I got high enough to twink out my rogue and sit in BG forever just massacring everything. I’m so stoked for this game!!
---
The point I was trying to make is that ultimately we are all just people playing a game. When we play together as a raid, it makes sense that gear is distributed in a way that benefits the guild as a whole. As such tanks get defensive gear first, casters get spellpower items over healers for offspec, etc.
---
When it comes to gear that drops in the raid, but that does not benefit or enhance the guilds ability to clear future raids faster and easier then that loot should be handled differently.
---
Since having a strong twohander is very important to both a hunter and a warrior for PvP, I fail to see why the Hunter player is inherently less deserving of gear that lets them reach their class potential in PvP than the warrior player. For both players the twohander will be the difference between a victory or a corpserun, and since giving it to neither of them will benefit the guilds ability to raid in any way, does it really matter who gets it?
---
Yup thats life. All things succumb to entropy.
---
How is this a gem?
---
Fact
---
&gt;You keep trying to shift the burden of proof.
---
I honestly don't think so. 
---
You're the one saying something isn't working as it's advertised or intended. I do believe if you're going to say private servers are not accurate, you have to show concrete proof of this. You're playing the victim here, but you're the one who came up with private server numbers being off. So I am going to ask you again, no matter if I call it proof or anything else. Do you base numbers being wrong on actual concrete 'proof' of private servers being off, or on the fact that you can't fathom people can do twice the DPS and clear raids 3 times as fast with optimization and better understand of the general game?
---
You've done nothing but attack my points as to why I believe people are pulling off better numbers. I think it's common sense people get better over time, by studying the game. Having more of the stats which scale the best on you. Using Zappers on cooldown. Being better at the game, dying less. I think these things makes you capable of you doing twice the DPS. Now, where is the proof of this? Well for starters, the world first videos in Naxxramas show several fury warriors not doing stuff like GCD spamming, that itself is a showcase of people either not being good enough to do it, or not knowing about it. About any 'hardcore' raider on private servers, do this, because it's actually worth it. I see Fury warriors using Thunderfury, about any slower decent weapon would be better, even slow blue weapons. I see mages running into mana problems, because they didn't chain cooldowns properly. All of these things add up and obviously I can't precisely do the math and say "that adds up to twice the damage nowadays" but it certainly does show that these people weren't the fucking gods you guys make them out to be, compared to the average player today.
---
&gt; So what the fuck is it that lets them do triple the damage? That's your  job. To explain triple the damage. Not to find some tiny detail or  purely vague and purely hypothetical factor like "more and better  knowledge" that could account for a 1% difference at most and declare  yourself the victor. 
---
I'm not sure if you got trouble reading. I have never said triple the damage and I've said I haven't in my last comment as well. My job is to explain what I believe makes them do twice the DPS, and these are the factors. People not understanding +weapon skills in general and certain stats on specific classes. People not swapping trinkets. People not Powershifting as a Feral Druid. People using fucking Thunderfury on Patchwerk to DPS. People not showing up fully raid buffed. People having lost their world buffs. 
---
All of this shit you give me with my 'proof' yet you can't even show me yours, because you're too busy being the victim and screaming burden of proof. If you actually had any proof of the numbers being wrong, you would've showed them already, because the discussion would've ended and you would've been right. You're doing this, because you threw that statement of private servers out there, and now I took you on the word and you can't back it up.
---
You give me so much shit for giving a lot of factors as to why people are doing more DPS these days, but your best bet and 'proof' is "lol private servers aren't really Blizzlike".
---
Keybinds look fine to me
---
Again, you're missing the point. It's not just the T0.5 set. It's also the loot from the summoned bosses.
---
Another example is [[Lord Valthalak's Staff of Command]](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=22335), which drops off a summoned T0.5 boss in UBRS.
---
If you can't see the value of getting items as good as these in simple dungeons, then there's not much else I can do for you.
---
All the item examples I've given are caster items since I'm a caster dps CL, but whenever my guild has some recruits or more often alts, we summon these bosses in the dungeons and get them extremely good gear before they even set foot in a dungeon.
---
Considering how long I believe it will take me just to get to level 60, if I decide to go Paladin I think I could probably just wait.  
---
They said they will not change the "data" as in loot tables, drop rates, etc.
---
So I doubt they will nerf it. It'll have to be a part of the meta, which is fine.

You can learn all the basic spells in the trees. The only thing limiting you is gold.  But there are a few spells which are unique to each talent tree (the last talent in every tree is not available unless you've spent 31 points into that tree, and a few others earlier in the tree too.) For example in the mage fire tree, Pyroblast is an 11 point skill and Combustion is the final skill and requires 31 point in fire tree.  Thus these spells would not be available to you if you had spent all your talent points in the ice/arcane trees.  But all of the basic spells in fire like fireball, fire blast, and scorch are still available to an ice/arcane mage as long as you pay the trainer.
---
The decay is too steep for you to gate ranks like you proposed, whenever you're serious about ranking above 10 you can't have that sort of stop and restart later.
---
 Unless you wanna spend the next decade ranking, stopping, ranking back to whatever you stopped at, taking another break rinse and repeat and never progressing.
---
Also why timegate only half the epic set anyway ? Rank 12 = 3 epic set pieces.
---
It just would be a waste of time to have objectively worse talent trees only to fix them again later. They aren’t really massively more powerful later on they just make more sense and are less frustrating.
---
I think only the most hardcore of the no changes crowd want a progressive talent system and even then it’s just out of principle as it means a worse gameplay experience. 
---
&gt;Blizz will announce a release date by the end of the month at PAX East.

when is PAX East?

Rogue is the best hands down for world pvp. For no other reason then all engagements start 100% on your terms. If you don't win a fight you get to start. Your incompetent even if another class is capable of beating you. Is it capable of doing it while spending all the time they try to play looking over their shoulder?
---
Other then that I would say Hunter and Mage. They are just strong at pvp. Hunter especially since you will be one of the few classes with a decent crit rating while you level.
---
&gt; until you lag for 2 seconds and just die.

Luckily this won't happen with modern infrastructure.

That's some smart thinking. Sadly my parents have no interest in gaming whatsoever. Solo dolo for me all the way to current retail. 😬

I raided with WiP after faction changing in 2014ish same priest JuicyJ. I was good friends with Opi.

Don't forget another user here scanned every page of that and the WoW Master Guide to read online.  Post was here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aucbc5/classic_wow_map/

How can all classes be saturated, there's still going to be class proportion imbalances even with higher numbers of players.
---
My guy it was in the first two sentences. If something seems like a bad premise at the start of a comment it's ok to ask what someone meant by it.
---
Your threshold for toxicity is super low I guess.
---
Try pvp if you’re worried about pve rotations being too simple.

Warlock in a pink dress in Silithus?
---
He was definitely wearing [[Vestments of the Shifting Sands]](https://www.wowhead.com/item=21499/vestments-of-the-shifting-sands) https://classicdb.ch/?item=21499.
---
It's a merely a suggested timeline with the current honor system we know. We have no idea if we'll get the old honor system, mind you a system that no one likes other than no life grinders.  The honor decay can be reduced until the last phase roles out as a suggestion.  My main concern is having people easily grind out the PvP mounts to easily and getting gear that supersedes current content released. 
---
Tier 0.5 is close to totally pointless anyway because it's so poorly itemised.
---
I suspect the issue there is that while Tier 0.5 is rubbish some of the stuff that drops from the bosses you summon to complete the quests is BiS even in 1.12. So if they let the shitty 0.5 gear into the game then overpowered stuff will sneak in with it.
---
As it is, the only people who will go after it are the kind of people who complete every achievement in a console game just because they are there.
---
I think regardless of what they say. They will end up nerfing it. The gold they gin up is unreal op. It wasn't really known about in classic so it wasn't a huge problem then. People know now so it will be a problem. I am not saying they will nerf it into being unusable but I can't imagine they go through 100% unerfed. Considering how much better they are then every other way to make gold. Tribute Runs&gt;DM E&gt;Every other farming method. The other methods aren't even a small amount behind. They are nothing compared to the first two.
---
Gonna be pretty funny seeing Stormwind full of level 5s trying to capitalize on the AH 
---
I doubt that given how routinely he gets basic things wrong. His thumbnail for a recent ZG video of his i saw on this sub is literally a boss from Zul'Aman...
---
Nah I just assumed you were trying to be an ass, sorry. But that’s exactly what I meant by saturated. Imbalances and such. I should have been more clear.
---
cool farming spots while leveling and you dont need farm at 60 lol 
---
skinning/vendor is all what people need :) and some levels to grind 
---
problem solved 
---
I don't even remember how I and others started doing this, but it seems like something that wasn't as popular pvp-wise as on other servers. A lot of times instead of trying to get a Southshore vs Tauren Mill thing going high lvl players would hang around that FP in WPL and just North of it go to town on each other. Eventually others would fly in (Horde would usually start outnumbering Alliance obviously) but the fighting would sort of slowly drift over to Andorhal and people would just start trying to claim one of those towers you light the torch on for that quest and defend it and the other faction would assault it. I remember there was this undead fire mage that was almost always there in WPL trying to stir the pot.
---
When I first re-tried Vanilla on a private server about two years ago I was just looking for a nostalgic throwback and thought I would quit within a matter of hours.
---
I ended up playing &gt;50 days of active playtime on that server. It is definitely not all nostalgia.
---
Classic will not be the same as retail vanilla anyways, so I am fine with the updated talents. The early content will be alot easier with the updated talents, but playing with the old ones would not be fun for alot of the classes. 
---
There was no PvP tab at all.
---
The importance of consume stacking, felwood tubers and buffs, world buffs, there is so much more we know now than we did in retail Vanilla.
---
Where to start, where to stop? I see what you're saying but I doubt they'll start making design changes.
---
Besides, Alch + Herb will always be profitable and will scale with inflation.
---
Is there any table of how much a (class) skill costs to train? I would like to find out what skills to learn, and which to not learn, and see the cost difference.  I've been using [classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch) alot, but it doesn't say how much a skill costs to train unfortunately.
---
Unsure about models, but there is an option to play with improved graphics.
---
With Dire Maul delay meaning Paladin/Warlock Class features are locked out does this mean we will see phasing of other classes quests etc.
---
Shaman's for example had a quest chain come in 1.8 etc. What other quest's should be locked out and if they are allowed in then why is that a fair reason to punish EU and KR Lock/Paly players etc by putting them on the US schedule.
---
Are they going to tooth comb all these quests or are we going to see some players sidelined from their class features.
---
I'm not being obtuse, I'm just pointing out the absurdity of your argument. 
---
They made changes constantly throughout vanilla. And we're in the process of making further changes. But those further changes weren't finished in time so they got delayed until TBC came out. 
---
It doesn't make sense to argue against changes that were supposed to be in vanilla but got delayed for business reasons unless you only want either version 1.0 because all changes are bad or version 1.12 as it was without a progressive release because that's the historic version. 
---
Even the whole progressive release of content thing is silly anyway. Most players never new an azeroth without dire maul. And if you compare subscriber numbers and world firsts to content release dates it's easy to see that only a minority of people cleared raids before new content "trivialised" them. Its pretty much just a pserver thing that wasn't part of most people's vanilla experience. 
---
For dungeon tanking and off-tanking specifically druids are more optimal than warriors because they deal more damage and generate more threat. Warriors are better at main tanking raids because they have more avoidance and defensive cooldowns against physical damage.
---
Remember we will start on the 1.12 balance patch, meaning druids get their massive armor boost right of the bat. So there *is* a real replacement for a good warrior for most content/encounters.
---
That said, it doesn't really matter as they are both formidable dungeon tanks and your ability will matter much more than anything else. There is a world of a difference between a good vs a bad tank in vanilla. Same goes for other roles ofc but you feel it the most with tanks.
---
Zero.zero repeating chance.
---
There were something about unofficial servers running with tbc exp levels. Twinhead (star) tried to make it more true to how it was in retail.
---
Maybe you don't. Some of us aren't in a rush to 60 and actually like running dungeons multiple times while leveling. 
---
Ohh, I see.
---
Any idea what the chance of seeing one from top level herb was?
---
Esfand, just wanted to let you know that I love you.
---
Opi is gnome fury warrior? 
---
Can confirm, was on a hufflepuff server
---
And how did this bother you ? Was it particularly fun to outlevel a zone back in the day ? Yay mobs got green and give less XP ?   
---
It gives you the opportunity to finish the quest lines, which are pretty good overall. And giving every zone a lvl requirement (100-102, 102-104 etc) for the 5 zones would've given more choice ? Sometimes I really don't get the gripes some people have with the game.
---
Of course the Blizzard of old is gone and it'll never come back. Yes, it is now more a shitty company than a good one, which has drifted away from its roots, but if you at the very least don't see this is as a positive thing in the sea of shittyness they've done in the past decade then you are blind.
---
That's awesome! Thanks for the link 
---
It's not difficult in terms of mechanics or complexity. It is difficult because it is a grind and you have to find a way to enjoy that. I actually love grinding nowadays so it isn't a problem for me. But most people see it as a necessairy evil.
---
It was supposed to be a joke but i kinda failed at making it noticeable that it was a joke, my bad.

---
Yes nobody likes the vanilla PvP system, its about the worst and unhealthiest system in the game to date.
---
But it was vanilla, and should remain the same.
---
When AQ is out the pve gear is better than the PvP end gear will ever be.
---
When naxx comes, PvP epic gear is garbage compared to it.
---
Vanilla wasn't balanced in many aspects, itemization being one of those.
---
Sure you get your rank 10 gear that's t2 - t2.5 ish level in the BWL era, but soon after raiders will surpass it and pvpers start raiding for gear aswel.
---

Everyone needs to kill a quest giver for an item that starts the attunement quest to BWL. Multiple raid groups on each side camping the mountain.

I was exalted with the Warsong Outriders and most of the way there for the defilers before level 60.  It’s true.
---
Herb pays off when you find that one black lotus and you get 3 hours worth of mara farming in 3 seconds
---
Actually a lot of that stuff won't be the case in retail classic. You can only stack world buffs because private servers are programmed incorrectly. One of the prominent youtubers made a video about it. In addition to that if they do actually go for a #no changes. Things like black lotus have a 2 hour respawn time. As oppossed to 6 minutes on private servers. Expect way less buffing.
---
This game is in no way shape or form solved. There will be plenty of massive diferences to what people expect to see.

Highly recommend you watch. 
---
I do not like him either but what makes you hate him so much?
---
The thing I was most shocked about in reading that was that ZG isn't releasing with BWL, I think that's a really good move and was doubtful of it happening. Kind of wish T0.5 was happening a phase earlier since for a lot of classes that's one of your best options for a non-healer pvp/fun set but oh well
---
I hope we get an honor system right away and don't even get any BG's until at least phase 2. I would love for the to reduce the penalty for honor penalty decays on same players outside of BG's as well by half.
---
This seems like a major upgrade to the original plan. It looks like they have abandoned the idea of an evergreen game in favour of disposable servers that chart a one-way path through patch progression to end up in an eternal 1.12, which probably means they will also do fresh servers at some future point to repeat the whole process.
---
I wonder what this is going to mean for talents and raid balancing - this update kills a lot of the unblizzlike tactics that are partially responsible for pirate server raiding being ezmode, but taking 1.12 talents into an unmodified MC is still ezmode. They don't have a *lot* of time up their sleeve, but they might still be working on tweaking the bosses or the spells to achieve truly Blizzlike challenge in launch MC and Ony which would be *amazing*.

Being on either side of the fence and looking at this completely in an objective manner, you’re wrong.  There’s definitely a chance. With the news today, Blizzard has confidently shown they are going to be more true to the no changes crowd and have already changed on some of their previously stated plans. This chance is low, but by no means impossible. 
---
Weird you are being downvoted, I guess the truth hurts
---
I know, that's why I said what I did.  Pragmatically, "always roll need" is the only right answer.  I'm just of the opinion that those who take loot from players who otherwise need it are kinda douchey.
---
"hop in vent" I miss ventrilo.
---
But 45 minute dungeon waits are ok? I don't get this thinking, why must PvP suffer for convenience but PvE can't?
---
This hate on silly names is a load of bull if you ask me.
---
That's part of the charm of Vanilla and community aspect, though.
---
I definitely agree with a large part of this, thank you for elaborating on your opinion.
---
Do you think the Shaman quest's will be out until there relevant phase  ?
---
Oh fuck op is actually him, please post more of your own content so we can eat it upside retards
---
It’s not an official announcement but it is a very clear, deliberate message that they intended fans to discover. They did the same thing for the Cataclysm launch date.
---
Not sure what you mean by your question.
---
I don't agree at all, you never see these people outside of BGs and too big of a pool means you don't see the same people often enough.
---
Epic SS vs TM battles ftw.
---
Well, murder would solve you issue.
---
BL will respawn less frequently but the population caps (hopefully) will also be lower, more blizzlike ~2.5k as opposed to ~10k.
---
Pservers should have buff stacking pretty close to accurate. As long as the tooltip is different on the item, the buff should stack, but the same tooltip does not stack. BL buffs (Blasted Lands buffs) are an exception to this.
---
Of course invariably there will be differences and I do expect the meta, or at least the progression meta, to be different.
---
I'm actually hoping it's going to be more difficult in Classic. We'll see.
---
I'll check out the video.
---
edit: I've seen it already :P I watch / have watched virtually every Classic video and relevant Vanilla content.
---
If you run the dungeons that many times you will be fine for +intellect gear anyway.
---
Wait, you think rolling on Edgemasters if youre not a warrior will make it so you can't get in a raid guild? Sorry that's not going to happen. 
---
ah look, you had no life back then too!
---
to me it depends entirely on queue times. if they can be maintained with a servers pop then leave it, if it takes 45 minutes to get a WSG open the flood gates.
---
Yes, after being burned so many times greeding on stuff too early then having everyone else need.  The unwritten rule that everyone needs on BoE blues/purples should be standard.
---
If you read their original announcement they left it open to changing the content release. They did not do so when talking about the talents. They said they are going with 1.12 and using that as a basis for where they’re starting. 
---
You can macro frost bolt to frost bolt so you can frost bolt while you frost bolt.

&gt;t the lives of content producers I enjoy but he came out of nowhere (at least for me) asking for support and crying the blues. Most of the content producers I support and follow hooked me with their content prior to gaining any financial su
---
Literally none of my content or demeanor has changed wtf lol, why would you dislike someone for going fulltime with it and making more content for the people who watch it to enjoy. It's not like I gate anything I do behind a paywall, holding content hostage or anything like that. And joining Method was a great idea for me to get to go to events and get to do the IRL streams and meet the people who watch my channel. If anything I feel like I'm in the most comfortable position I've been in since I got banned. In the last couple of months, for the first time since the ban, I feel like I can do whatever/play whatever game I want to play and people are going to enjoy the content that I put out for me being who I am. I never have the thought of "oh I guess I should stream \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because I have to, to not kill my channel" which is an incredibly fortunate position for any streamer to be in. If they feel comfortable/confident streaming whatever they want it makes for the best streams because they don't feel bound by anything.

---
Stealth Classes are obvious choices, but if you often world pvp in groups, your opponent may still know there are stealthies when you mount and move with non stealthed friendlies. Just try not to end up in a situation where neither you or your friend can interrupt spells or something.
---
do tell more
---
This is the bare minimum we could expect tbh.
---
No words on UBRS 15men , scholo 10men etc.
---
It just feels like I'm reading a private server blog.
---
Dungeon difficulty was ruined by the end of vanilla with the player requirement reduction.
---
Why is this important? I never reached end game in vanilla so I don’t know the significance of this.
---
I'd probably get aggravated from the guy telling me what I'm doing wrong every 30 seconds. 
---
"Why did you take that route?! That is NOT the most efficient way for our speed leveling routine we preplanned last week. Fuck it, delete your character and start over. Practice makes perfect."
---
The day honor and ranks came out in vanilla, I was chilling in Stormwind. On Sargeras, the horde slightly outnumbered us and was pretty aggressive. 
---
Some hordies organized a huge city raid on Stormwind. This was EARLY vanilla, so tons of non 60s in the horde raid.  Some of my buddies and I started fighting (we were all 60, ah, being young and having enough free time back then), we just kept going. One down, moved to the next. Kept going.
---
Before I knew it I was near the rebel camp in North stv. We had been almost nonstop killing chasing people from Stormwind, through elywnn into duskwood, down into stv.
---
My second favorite time, I was an alchemist and bored. Used invisiblity potions to sneak into ogrimmar(like I said, I was bored and young, would run into a house and wait for cooldown, rinse repeat) and killed an auctioneer (don't even think you can anymore, but when the world was young you could). I like to imagine horde chat went ape shit over a pally coming out of stealth and bitch smacking an auctioneer. And promptly slaughtering me and calling me all manners of stupid as well of course, lol.
---
Thanks man! Bump it again, I get a lot of DM's and I try to respond but sometimes they just get lost 
---
They also life tap
---
I agree with everything you said there. I just fairly recently started to play wow again (didn't since Wraith came out) and after first leveling a Hunter it really struck me how Tanks and Healers are carrying the group content, not DPS in even the slightest.
---
Tanks basically dictate everything from positioning to tempo while healers be efficient and sometimes have spot on reaction. The only thing you need from a DPS is to follow nicely and not fuck up.
---
Even as a Hunter who has good threat control themselves with FD, Distracting Shot and Growl and decent CC with traps you can sometimes do damage control and kiting but 99% of the time you just exist so content is cleared in a reasonable amount of time, which is true for any DPS class.
---
I dont think you BFA kids will understand until you learn by trial and error but whats the use arguing
---
I can only partly agree. Classes were more distinct, but moreso because some were lacking a lot of stuff. In dungeons, it made almost no difference which classes were present in my experience, unless we talk about specific examples like a hunter to kite drakisath.  
---
Ofc some classes could in certain situations with certain builds safe the day but I wouldn't call that a fundamentally different experience.  
---
&gt; It doesn't matter if you have a paladin, warrior, demon hunter, monk, or  druid tanking. They run in and smash AOE while holding agro without  even trying. They're probably watching television while they're doing  it. Same thing for healer. 
---
Thats not really true at all, aside from the threat thing unless we have a skittish week. At least some tanks excell in different types of play, bring certain utility. The same goes for healers ofc.   
---
And compared to classic, mobs aren't damage sponges anymore, where the only thing you'd do was keeping an eye on threat. I'd rather CC, interupt, cleanse, purge, target switch, move out of AoE's as every role, whilst keeping trash at bay instead of spamming non-stop blizzard on every trash group.  
---
But tastes differ, so I really don't mind if someone enjoys classic, I did as well back in the day.  
---
This. Played a 60 gnome warlock on Nostalrius and it bothered me so much I just gave up on pvp. 
---
Just to be clear I am not arguing with you because I am no expert. I am just asking because it says quite clearly in the video that world buff stacking won't be a thing. Was the video wrong on that? 
---
As far as other buffs like Flasks. I know flask of titans takes a black lotus. Which as I undestood watching the video. There are only 8 nodes for and they respawn at 2 hours rather then 6 minutes. That will mean things like titans will not be readily available to your average guild. I think that a lone will make content way harder.
---
No it actually doesn't make logical sense, because a class being saturated is relative to the population of other classes. But I get what you meant overall, this is just nitpicking.
---
In general, their damage dots still aren't good enough with 16 slots.
---
Yup, that kept me back in the day as well. But with PvE gear being important in PvP, especially when they drop the whole pvp system + rewards later than BWL, I won't be able to skip PvE.
---
Haha, fair enough. As a tank or DPS, I’d do the same, though I wasn’t sure I’d want to bother with engineering as a healer.
---
I miss having to CC mobs and knowing your toon well enough to be able to control your CC aswell as dps what the tank was focusing on. 
---
