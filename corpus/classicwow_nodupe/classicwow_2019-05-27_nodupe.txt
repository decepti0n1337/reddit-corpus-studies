The open slots should be equip macros that you gave to triple tap to work properly.

---
They’re viable in PvP, and not really viable for PvE.
---
Alliance if you want to play with kids.
---

---
Horde if you want to play with adults (and also get all the significant World Firsts).
---
Yes. Professions should be tedious, that way the people who put the effort in can benefit more from it.

orc rogues are bis in pvp and pve. Alliance has two classes that fear, warlocks and priests. Alliance Warlocks are almost non-existent in PvP and priest's fear is insanely telegraphed that you can see it coming a mile away. Stuns on the other hand, every class on alliance is capable of stunning. The best coming from paladins, which are more popular than warlocks on alliance.
---
5% flat hp increase is no joke and war stomp in a dungeon setting can be massive 
---
Also they have the biggest weapons, make of that what you will
---
They're life changing.  I setup my bars like a phone pad (and side of mouse), 3x4.  First set is normal, second is shift, third is ctrl.  Master that with any class and you will become god.  Took me almost a year to get a vanilla warrior down when I started playing recently.   When you move with wsad, there aren't enough buttons around that hand for some classes.
---
Where could you purchase stuff like this? Just curious. Asking for a friend
---
If you think private server experience means nothing you’re either delusional or lying to yourself
---
You must be super fun at parties.
---
Yikes is right. Somehow this subreddit has thrown respect for Intellectual Property to the wind and legitimized piracy.
---
Private servers don't make you a pirate, but Savory Deviate Delights sometimes do.

A magical disturbance found beneath Blackrock mountain alerted the Grand Magi of Dalaran and they have learned the Firelord has returned. The Mages of Dalaran sought help from a Warrior who sought glory. A priest and a paladin duo giving their aid. A druid who joined to commune with nature to help restore balance to the land and 3 warlocks, though not confessing they are cultists seek to learn ancient magics of the runes dotted around the Firelords lair.
---
Runecloth is the cheapest and most easy for a fresh warrior, I'd try Azshara.
---
Yeah people have been playing vanilla tbc and wotlk arena/premades for years now and the meta developed much much further.
---
smh fucking boomers
---
Absolutely. During the crazy early part of the Stress test my brother and I rolled warrior/paladin and camped the will es just outside northshire. Was actually pretty decent exp then we moved onto jasperlode and backinto northshire.
---
The only reason WoW Classic exists is because of Private Servers.
---
Their just sour cause they're game sucks now
---
Behold the ugly result of not replying to other people's threads, and having that subtle animosity build up.
---
Pretty nice, iv'e sorta already made my mind up as to what i wanna do but this was still a nice read. For me it's situational atm. if the friends i know who do play retail decide to jump into vanila, I'll go Priest because our lil group will then be Mage,Warrior and Priest, so a nice Tank,DD and Healer triple team, if they don't play or if they get bored and go back to retail, I'll role either Warlock for PvE or if i'm in a PvP mood which is rare for me in mmorpgs, I'll go rogue and do a lot of WPvP and regular PvP instead.

[Hunter] Having issues with my pet disengaging with the mob and not re-engaging no matter how many times I tell him to, unless I'm in melee range of the mob; he disengages immediately if I move away. Seems to only happen when I have a dot on the mob (I noticed this happening consistently after I got immo trap as a spell, and had it happen with SS today.)
---
Level 17 NE hunter, Nightstalker pet level 6 loyalty, well fed, only has growl as ability
---
Same, same.
---
Do you know what alcohol does to your liver?! You put that drink down, motherfucker!
---
I've been a warlock player since BC but I'm reevaluating which class to play come classic.
---
I know I want to play DPS and I'd prefer being self sufficient at leveling and probably caster. As far as casters go, are Mage and Warlock the only "viable" raiding casters? Shadow Priest is like a 1 per raid kind of thing to make warlock DPS go up right? And elemental shaman and boomkins aren't a thing at all?
---
Haha. That's a way to look at it. If you invalidate all of the steps in between A to Z and only count first to clear the instance, sure.
---
It's been done before
---
Man our first Ragnarok kill was the exact same way....just like 10 heroes left in a field of bodies.  Truly epic.
---
Hpal grows much more viable once BWL hits since they can wear t2 etc, sp plate gear. It's also where hunters warriors start to scale well with gear (pvp that is) where their support is very good. Grenades nets tidal charms helms rocketboots etc, getting to a pala is hard as hell and you do not require that much peeling.
---
Also, bubble allows you to bruteforce any engagement or just make your flag carrier immortal. Priests have different uses than Palas but Pala is the reason ally&gt;horde in premades in general.
---
So what?
---
It's barely the same weapon looking at how blizzard retconned the corrupted version out of existence
---
It means sometging and you can see alot of misinformation flooding through from these PS people/you tubers as they "remember" private server rates and not release rates.
---
Lots of missing spells and spawn timers changed on private servers to what was live and i guess soon to be again
---
i wouldn't use loot council for 40 mans. you just don't get enough loot. you get 2 or 3 pieces per boss.
---
Lmao
---
Seems like a workout.. too far apart for feet..
---
Isn't he the one who reported the boss for doing too much damage when he tried to tank with broken gear?
---
Alliance will dominate PvP....
---
PvE who cares dude it's 15 years old you can clear it with a bunch of empty raid slots. Even naxx
---
Again this is not about progression. This is about who is better at PvE. And in a good guild the cap for your DPS will be the threat of your tanks. 
---
Salvation is goddddlike
---
We won't get into basically infinite mana for paladins next to the other classes when full buffed. Many world buffs all give spell crit, and no one benefits from spell crit more than pala
---
And they also have a very good ratio to int/spell crit. So no one benefits from Int like them
---
By naxx you can sustain almost sustain your max HPS indefinitely with buffs and rational consume use.
---
&gt;You just keep proving yourself ignorant and wrong with every post you make
---
I've seen delusional people before, but man are you beyond that LOL.
---
&gt;Yeah, if those guys aren't yet rank 14 on their server then I can guarantee that at that point no one will yet be.
---
You're actually retarded. I have no hope.
---
Cheers thanks for that, it means a lot! We just set up twitch on Friday to start preparing for launch day so we have a long way to go. I'll be streaming speedruns for the next few months on the beta and smashing out some times. Hopefully you'll join us and ask some questions!
---
Just making sure here...you stayed in close proximity right? because that's a thing...get too far from the npc and the quest will fail.
---
Warrior endgame/gameplay is a lot more rewarding and scaling if you are a former Gladiator tier player, specially if you plan to lead anything
---
Mhmm, they could even allow it after launch. So they could focus on fixing bugs and having a successful launch. Then once things are settled, before decisions are made about the future, they can launch an update to opt into newer graphics.
---
I can see people getting perma banned for doing this today...
---
In starting zones they're implementing layering, meaning there's a cap of a number of players on a certain instance of a zone. It's still gonna bottleneck people for a while waiting for respawns (particularly on quests that require &lt;100% drops from a large number of mobs), but it shouldn't be too bad.
---
You keep saying “oom before resto Druid” but that doesn’t mean they’re less efficient if they’re casting the same heal value .5s faster.
---
It means their HPS (heals per second) are higher. 
---
You should not compare what time they go oom, but at what amount of healing they’ve done before going oom. 
---
Technically there are multiple dimensions for healer efficiency - HPS, mana:health, sustained healing period, and heal granularity.
---
Who goes oom first only tells you sustained healing period: but that’s not the while story.
---
Uhh that’s...that’s how it works.
---
You don’t talk about who did the best in a marathon by who was fastest for the first 24 miles. I can’t even believe you attempted to make that argument lmfao
---
My god dude, you’re just a horde fanboy, you can’t admit that you’re at a loss. Swallow your pride and move on
---
That's the point we were making dude. The Alliance has an advantage when it comes to raiding. 
---
The skill of an individual group of ~40-50 people is largely irrelevant to the argument lol.
---
I just used mouse wheel up to dance up and mouse wheel down to stance dance down, but this is definitely cooler.

This idea has been out and profited on for years..

There's a place in the water around Menethil that is actually Dun Morogh water. Drown there and you end up at the Dun Morogh GY.
---
Works fine yes.
---
Nah I'm a double agent ;)
---
No and hopefully not.
---
Haha. That's a horrible argument. World first runs aren't a marathon. They're a series of sprints. The alliance won the vast majority of the sprints. Just because you win the last run of the night doesn't mean the other team doesn't have more medals.
---
I have played since BC, I have largely experienced all the content the game has to offer up until the start of BFA. Got bored there after 2 months lol. But I hear ya, its a time commitment to get through it in a week and a half but I am hoping to achieve it. I need to get the gold farming going for  BIS advantage as early as possible for raiding groups lol.
---
I hope so, although idk... I feel classic will need to bring a HUGE subscriber increase for them to do it
---
I totally need one of these set to warstomp
---
If you're going to do tests with gear that 99.9% of players will never see, at least do it with best-in-slot.
---
Yes
---
From my understanding there is like maybe one shadow priest and ele shaman a raid. Moonkin is the one true useless meme spec. Maybe consider hunter? Not a caster but definitely self sufficient
---
Definitely. I hope some of the future stress tests will be stable and we can really test some early routes when theres a ton of people in the starting zones. I think the first few hours of classic launch will be the most important for early leveling speeds.
---
Alliance if you’re smart.
---
Horde if you’re a screeching zergling that likes fortnite.
---
I think its highly likely to see TBC after if Classic is a success. The real question is, will they change TBC to be more Classic-like
---
Sound like you going alliance... if you can't enjoy the zones that you'll spend days and days in then why go horde?
---
Personally I think being able to enjoy the way your character looks matters the most to me.
---
I can play 3 out 4 races happily on Horde, but when I play Alliance I can enjoy playing Night Elves.
---
Basically if you don't like any Ally races, you're gonna have a bad time even if you like the cities and cooler zones.
---
Loot council is, in a perfect world, the most fair way to distribute loot. Objective parties should give the gear to the people who most benefit the entire raid (MT, gear dependent DPS in particular), but in practice are biased and play favorites. DKP on the other hand is the most objective loot system possible, but inhibits progress because players who don't utilize the gear the best get it.
---
So basically, there's no real answer on how to run loot systems and you can prefer one over the other.
---
Paladin has the highest throughput, Priest has the most versatility and Shaman/Druid are kind of between the middle of those two. Priest is usually seen has the best healer in PvE because it has an excellent combination of throughput and versatility.
---
if you're focusing on PvP, Paladin -&gt; Priest = Druid -&gt; Shaman, imo.
---
not worth replying to him. 
---
Dude just made up false information without any sources. LOL
---
&gt; The Alliance has an advantage when it comes to raiding.
---
No, they don't.
---
History doesn't show this.
---
Private servers don't show this.
---
You have no evidence to show this.
---
Cite your sources
---
TBC was kinda vanila, from what i heard it's considered by the older vets that TBC is almost like vanila but just with more content and ofc. different balances between classes. I also only played during TBC \[only 2 months due to being young with not much money\] so i can't really confirm how true that is but leveling was still much slower then modern retail wow \[only got to 50 before stopping\] , we still had the old skill trees, rogues were hated by everyone who wasn't a rogue main, took a long time to travel anywhere \[which isn't bad\],communication and befrending people was a requirement to be able to advance, no waypoints and markers you had to read quests and so forth.
---
You will probably be healing in the beginning if you are intent on raiding;  at least if the guild cares about maximizing dps - which isn't necessary but will probably happen. Shadow isn't really that viable with the initial raids and items available.
---
Hope you don't plan on DPS'ing.
---
Intel HD 620 is not even old (3 years old) so it should be fine with WoW Classic which is less demanding than BFA. It's probably a good idea to report it if you can because such integrated graphic should run WoW Classic and without issues.
---
If Blizzard twitter poll is to believe its going to ba a 56/44 split split favoring the Horde. 
---
Personally idc. I'm rolling Alliance this time around just because I want a new experience.
---
&gt;  It's about speed
---
Which is why Horde had all but one of the World First raid clears and holds a massive majority of the speedrun records.
---
this question is vitality important. it's more important then streamer favoritism, if you didn't get into beta or not, #nochanges and if elite damage is too low...
---
i'm rolling a Female Night Elf Priest. however... should she have purple hair ot turquoise hair? i'm planning on using the longest hair style. i just not sure which would look better when matched with T2/T3. my gut says turquoise.
---
So 10g admission per group member to bring them along in the group? That actually sounds like a really good idea as most wont put in the time to get the key
---
I really wish that when I come back someday, that I could play a Tauren on the Alliance side.

Completely correct. In most situations you will hinder your raid by running 440 defense by not being able to hold aggro.
---
440 defense 2% hit is a sure way to know your tank sucks dick.
---
They talked about it at blizzcon when it was first announced.
---
I was a BC tauren male gladiator warrior and I've maced stunned people behind pillars before, I didn't get much of that done in Vanilla but Warstomp has saved me so many more times than bloodfury has, but it can go both ways right. I personally didn't think stun resist was ever useful in my warrior career because you literally shit on anything that has stuns in their kits anyway.
---
Yes, they so.
---
History does show this. See the world first list.
---
Private servers have broken the game down so much it doesn't matter. APES cleared Naxx the day it opened on ND lol (as Alliance)

Are you seriously saying that Shamans provide more utility than Paladins?

Btw you have to have an active subscription to WoW to even have a chance to get into beta. Just to let you know.
---
There are no medals for coming in second place when there's only two competitors.
---
Dude this looks pretty useful
---
“I was only pretending to be retarded guys lol xD”
---
Yeah they very likely will. Perhaps not for all the servers, but definitely for some of the servers, they will progress from classic through BFA and Beyond
---
They lost the race, end of story. Have fun with your participation trophy
---
It was still so much different.
---
There were easily accessible loot tables and stuff, but raid strategy was pretty arcane to the average player.
---
I played a priest and partied with my friend who was a warrior all the time. Of course we had no clue as to certain things. I leveled as holy spec and he leveled as tank spec. This time will be so different.
---
&gt; Are you seriously saying that Shamans provide more utility than Paladins?

Utility? Yes. Healing? No.

10 individual sprints.

One team one 8.

Haha good argument bud. (; 
---
I was horde btw. Just an honest, non biased assessment.
---
Starting retail wow with no experience isn't nice because they've balanced play around people that have been playing for 12 years.
---
I returned after 9 years away, leveled a war, but getting a new ability every hour of game play means I haven't got a clue what I'm doing.
---
Classic wow will be much more friendly to new players.
---
It's not that great I have stress test and sat the night of for 6 hours stuck at the character creation screen or at the login screen.
---
Warrior isn't bad at all, Paladin is perpetually worse and Priest pre40 is terrible - it's not about how many hours you spend in the game but how effective you are in your questing zones and dungeons.
---
I don't think they would. After all, much like the classic private server Community, there are tens of thousands of fans of burning crusade in the private server Community who like burning Crusade for what it is, it would be another hashtag no changes deal.
---
It's 10 sprints to ONE finish line, a finish line the Alliance only crossed first in 1 of 5 races.
---
Yea in a guild with clickers, why you think I care about some clickers speed run I have no idea
---
It's like you people don't know who you're looking up to. Yea some of them were way ahead of their time.
---
Some of them were also clickers. 
---
Like I said horde is good...If your tanks are better than your clicker DPS lol. But that's not gonna be a problem in 2019
---
Just follow that link. I'm not affiliated with it at all, just trying to help the other poster find the kinda guild he was thinking about. FTH! LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
It even says WoW: Legion PTR on your account if youre in the beta
---
I was considering disenchanting and dropping it later. Market might be saturated with low lvl mats from skinning, mining, herbism but I see it would cost a lot.
---
They have healing spells. They can be a healer regardless of spec. They just aren’t the most efficient they could be if they were spec’d into healing.
---
I hope someone here makes a graph or infographic that shows which servers have streamers on them.

Turquoise for sure.

---
May your windfury proc often
---
That delivery was epic.
---
Your opinion doesn't matter. The facts are the facts. Horde finishes first in an overwhelming number of races.
---
What people find good is subjective. You hate flying because you think it killed world pvp, but honestly if enough players cared about world pvp they would have kept it going, there is probably many factors other than flying that helped with that. I personally didn't mind flying in most cases, because I didn't care for world pvp. I don't find getting camped by 3 max level characters while being level 20 or lower level just cause they can fun. Especially not now where I have way less time to play the game.   
---
That isn't to say I don't find problems with flying. I hated how after BC Blizzard started making many zones require flying to do half the dailies, that is where it starts to bother me. If the zones were designed in a way where flying wasn't mandatory I could argue that people that did want ground mounts could just do them, but I didn't really notice it until MoP when 90% of the dailies once you hit 90 required you to have flying and it annoyed me cause I wanted to use ground mounts. I can also argue that, I did enjoy the little things in BC that made flying feel pretty fun, like the little mini game out in Shadowmoon Valley that let me fly and test my fly skills against the captains of the Fel orcs for the Netherwing trinket.  
---
On the flip side, I absolutely love BGs, it let me get my pvp fix when I really wanted to pvp on an even and fair ground. Am I the typical vanilla player? Most definitely not, but to just say that your statement is the factual truth and anyone that doesn't agree is basically just flat out wrong and no one could ever like it. It is basically the equivalent of a speedrunner running say Sekiro in 30 minutes and they think it is the only way to play the game, but someone else isn't into pure speed and likes looking around at the game so they clear it in an hour and 30 minutes and then are told by the speedrunner that they are garbage and they don't want them in the community. I think there is definitely ways that flying could be fixed to make it less mandatory, such as adding like a flight limit, or setting a debuff that punishes you if you go too high.
---
If is place to be, get your epic mount and chain jump back and forth over the gap in front of the auction house.
---
The night is dark and full of plot errors
---
The reason they used it is because that engine is much more optimized and there was no sense in throwing away 12+ years of development on the engine just because. I have heard they have updated to the 8.0 engine but I could be wrong.
---
I posted the sources you Alliance dicknugget. Here they are again:

This is what I am thinking of doing. Basically want to heal in PvP but have ability to mess some ppl up if they come too close.
---
It doesn't matter how well you do on individual laps if you don't cross the finish line first. Alliance had BWL first, everything else went to Horde.
---
They're not a conjoined thing. World first Pathwerk is just world first Patchwerk. If you want to make the argument that they were the first to clear the raid, sure they've got the majority. But once again, that invalidates all other encounters so you have to look at them separately.
---
Why, worried that there aren't enough classic fans to keep things populated if tbc/wotlk are options?
---
Fly into the danga zone!
---
Yeah I too have heard people saying it’s been updated to 8.x but I haven’t seen a source to that
---
Frostadamus plays mage
---
The only real change is to flying. Should there be 280% flying? That is where people argue the game began to drastically change. Then, if they go to WOTLK it would be the removal of LFG / LFD.
---
I think we're going to find the game is not forgiving, especially when there's no real rush for most people and we'll see a rise in off-meta specs.
---
Most people say the community is the best part of wow classic. I want to prove these people right. There's no room for min/max in an RPG (unless that's what you want to do and how you have fun)... Do what's cool and what makes your heart go boom boom boom.
---
I don't mind/max my life (if I did I'd definitely minimize work and maximize sex)... Why min/max my second life??? 
---
Do what feels good!!!
---
I understand the reasons for not using the old client (1.x.x) I'm more curious about whether the current client is a fork of 7.3.5 or 8.x.x.
---
Hakurai plays warrior really good leveling guide from him as well
---
Interesting, wish I did have the beta!
---
why didnt you tell me this 14 years ago. UGH
---
Really seems like in crowded starting zones only the easiest quests will be worth it and then some mob grinding after that
---
All the other encounters are just cannon fodder to the actual antagonist of the entire patch.
---
AHHHHH
---
Well, when 1.4 hits they'll gain much more viability since thats when shamans start to see their major nerfs to frost shock, losing their ability to indefintely stack their 50% movement slow on people.
---
This is additionally when we'll see the rise of the dualwield windfury builds, which were...decent.
---
Frost specc mages, warlocks, and shadow priests.
---
Mostly warlocks, because I can't recall if their voidwalker sacrifice tactic was patched in 1.4 or not, bit i recall it not seeing any changes till wrath.
---
Not related to Classic, but Inky Black nighttime is BiS.
---
I think the idea is to keep the engine up to date with the retail engine.
---
Lol negativity in the classic wow sub wowzers!
---
If classic fails wow is dead right?
---
In similar but much slower way that [38 priests take on Onyxia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rKVe-oQ6QI)

Tier 0.5 is like phase 4 or something.  This probably wont be available until 2021, no joke.

FOR THE HORDE

I'm a Night Elf :C

Guess I can shadowmeld and mind control people off cliffs though!
---
I'm so excited to have another thousand pages of #nochanges debates just for burning Crusade.
---
This answer is just as shit as it was when it came from retail players when Vanilla was asked for. You can stay on a content frozen server with just Classic for all eternity so you have no good reason to be against it.
---
Great job!

Better get Ultra Wide Monitor 21:9 Aspect Ratio. I have 27" 2k Dell Monitor (2048 x 1080) Resolution and Its wack 17:9 Aspect Ratio (Kinda Office Monitor) but hey its 2k. I still prefer my old LG 29" 2560 x 1080 screen but it was broken.. 16:9 / 17:9 Aspect Ratio doesnt have that much difference. But once you use 21:9 Monitor that blow ur mind. problem is that they arent cheap :(  MSI 34" 3440x1440 FreeSync is a nice one. Since you have 1070Ti GPU. that a good monitor for it since Nvidia driver support FreeSync Monitor too. and 4k in gaming does not look good on small size screen unless you are going 40+ Inch..
---
To be honest, I think this is only part true personally.
---
I'm all for the classic experience, but we should be as you said, perfectly honest. Vanilla WoW is a shit show for game design. It has so many faults when it comes to design, but the main issue why changes wouldn't work in the long run is because the game was designed with all of the shit design and faults in mind.
---
If we were to go back 14 years and fix all of the issues in the game and then balance the game accordingly to that (aka, balanced classes with clear cons and pros between them and the debuff limit lifted) then WoW would still be as popular. And in that alternate timeline, if a Classic WoW were to come out around those times and someone made a post saying "there should be a debuff limit" then people would still say the same #nochanges.
---
WoW Classic is 50% TERRIBLE game design and 50% good game design. The most important thing about Classic is the 50% that is good is stuff like community, slower and meaningful leveling etc. It helped create a world for us to fully enjoy and disappear into. We were nerds, some who had friends, some who didn't, some who made them on here and some who brought their own. Because of that, we got to live with and fondly remember the shit design aspects too. We know they're shit, but it's part of the charm now. It's in our minds and that's it.
---
It's like having a relative gift you a mirror when you were younger. you were close, and that person has passed away. The mirror she gave you is tarnished from when that relative has owned it. You could easily fix it, but it's how you received it from them, it's a part of that memory and you don't want to fix it.
---
That's why Classic WoW should stay as is. Not because there's some sort of elite entitlement that some people have on this forum where they feel as if they are *owed* something by Blizzard. But it should stay the same because we want that world back and not an altered one.
---
It is, but the Imp has a lot of value. You would only spec DS/Ruin if you have a consistent group and you know for sure that other Warlocks are taking care of the Imp buff.
---
You think you wont be 60 until 2 years after launch?
---
&gt;You can stay on a content frozen server with just Classic for all eternity so you have no good reason to be against it.
---
Literally the opposite of what OP asked and I responded to...
---
i think the slower the weapon and the higher the top end dmg is, the bigger the crits will be.
---
It's a mathematical fact dude, lol
---
Live with it
---
Just like there have been times Horde was better than Alliance as a mathematical fact on other expansions I'm sure. Judging by the imbalance there. That doesn't come outta nowhere
---
And surprise having different classes available to you bring a massive amount of asymmetry relative to different racial. And on this patch Alliance DUMPSTERS horde in just about every scenario but AB
---
Pretty much my weekend :'(
---
It's a legitimate question - what reason is there to not give a tbc or wotlk option?
---
Would be interesting if Blizzard can make it easy to maintain going forward where you can always have a server available that goes up to  any expansion so everyone has the choice to play on the content they like the most. How practical it would be I do t know, but maybe they could make it work.
---
of all the WoW expansions, does it just make sense that the original game, before any expansion, would be the most simple an organic?
---
I mean you say a few hours after but back in BFA I remember getting the email literally a week after being given access.
---
"r/f/v" master race
---
It hasn't been updated. 8.1 has CPU Multithreading support. The WoW Classic client does not.
---
TOO SOON
---
All stress test was was a few hours of not being able to log in followed by a crappy day of work due to lack of sleep :P
---
lmao what an elaborate way to say "I don't understand why slippery slope is a fallacy".
---
If you go your entire life thinking "omg everyone likes pepperoni but I can't suggest that because WHAT IF PINEAPPLE?!?" you'll probably miss out on a whole lot of pepperoni for absolutely no reason, my dude.
---
There won't be that many high level players either if outlands becomes the next late game zone. Before everyone had to travel all over the world to go different locations and new players would see all those raiders in their amazing gear. It would all be gone if everyone stayed in another dimension
---
You made me chuckle, would be even funnier if it was just a joke
---
&gt; It's a mathematical fact dude, lol

First MC Clear: Horde
---
First Ony Clear: Horde

First AQ40 Clear: Horde

First Naxx Clear: Horde

Those are the facts and there's plenty more I listed above.
---
Perhaps moved across a border without knowing it. Let me help you here :)
---
The moment you claim my 'argument' is 'weak' you move into the realm of philosophy, not science, so that is exactly how it works. 
---
You assume when I assert something that you question that 'I" am the only one who needs to provide evidence; one way of viewing epistemology, one that I find faulty. 
---
On the contrary, simply asserting that 'my experience of thousands of hours of gameplay at the highest level of play and video proof of non leeway is 'meaningless' is exactly the opposite of a good argument, but a mere non-starter. 
---
I find your response thus far empty, void of any thought, and completely agnostic to helping solve the problem at hand. Which is unfortunate because you seem to trying to help but haven't provided anything helpful. I hope this can change :)
---
back in vanilla i used to put my wifes priest in my group with my warrior and make her toon auto follow me and i would just go grind and farm with the warrior, occasionally tapping the renew button on my wifes laptop. worked nice
---
Don't worry.
---
The game itself is very, very simple. The classes in PvE are not difficult at all, the dungeons are not over the top difficult either. The main thing you need to deal with, is understanding the world and how it works.
---
In PvP, people are still bad, so no worries there. You'll be fine.
---
From personal experience maining a paladin in classic, I always preferred holy/prot with a 2hand. In pve it’s the same for healing, but in pvp you will be getting reckoning stacks as you are healing, then just drop someone from 60% to 0. Using holy/ret if you are spending time healing people you can’t really dps (since paladin damage is slow) and f you focus on dps it’s really hard to heal. The reckon holy spec allows you to heal and then you just need 1 swing for damage. Also shorter CD on HoJ.
---
Food for thought
---
hardest boss in naxx.
---
Oooh boy that’s a doozy
---
CT-Mod
---
Honestly 18 months is a huge understatement imo.  Phase 6 is likely 2.5 years away from launch.  So yeah sometime in 2022 naxx might be just coming out.
---
An option is one thing, forcing classic to tbc is an entirely different thing.
---
And for the "why not? They could just have separate servers"
---
I'm sure blizzard would want to re-do tbc/wotlk without charging anything... or wait! They could just add $15 to the sub right?
---
Doesn't make sense for them to do tbc/wotlk - I apologize if that makes anyone upset.
---
And to answer "didn't make sense for them to do classic" it did... many more private servers were made and populated off of vanilla wow. While there were players for other expansions blizzard already didn't want to go backwards... now that they have, they won't stay there unless it's lucrative.
---
cool, thanks so much! no problems there for me, i'm planning on playing a death knight.
---
I mean we're going to go thhrough all content on 1.12 which is one of the biggest changes they could have made to the core vanilla experience. I understand why they have these knee-jerk reactions - Blizzard has a terrible track record as of the past 10 years - but holy fuck they're irrational beyond salvation.
---
Warlock hard counters Shaman. I don't know what else to tell you. The Warlock's dots will kill the Shaman faster than that one shock every 6 seconds will kill the Warlock. Enhancement can't close gaps and Elemental/Resto can't cast with Curse of Tongues on them.
---
Ya I don't get it. Graphical updates wouldn't change the gameplay.
---
I've nearly always played Horde and I've never seen this level of fanboyism haha.
---
Bro I was playing DDR at the YMCA in 2002, its been out forever
---
Horde players are always seething with anger and constantly sperging. 
---
I’ll have to go Alliance this time.

Who need what when you have the original steel series WoW MMO mouse still kicking around.

There's a few girls at my work that can do that, I'm always kind of jealous as a 6' 1" dude.

esfand and asmon get carried by hunters

Alliance represent!

I was impressed by the Armoury kill, but I wasn't expecting Cathedral to be possible at level 30. Intrigued to see if these guys will push any further while the beta is capped at 30.

I can't wait until 15 years from now when WoW Classic is on BFA and we get to burn your stupid tree all over again.

Reality: Druids are not great.

Jeez that is pretty far out... well on the other hand I assume I will have like 5-10h playtime per week so... getting to 60 farming dungeon set1 playing alts... taking wow breaks who knows... but alright guess I'll just go for D1 set as a main goal. And 0.5 if I am still around 2021 :D
---
You didn't list any relevant facts
---
&amp;#x200B;

Yes those thigns are true. But mean nothing if they were done by clickers beating other clickers, lol
---
It's called a non sequitur
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3gjoa5/the\_greatest\_mage\_in\_vanilla\_or\_possibly\_ever/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3gjoa5/the_greatest_mage_in_vanilla_or_possibly_ever/)
---
Guy beat the game as a clicker. What makes you think anything they did back then matters to which faction is better?
---
Pretending any of thsoe guilds were near ceiling when they struggled so long to clear everything is a joke. Obviously progression takes time. But not that much time, they were bad. If you re released that content to day after magically removing memory/traces of it from the universe. Modern MMO players would be clearing some of these raids in a few hours.
---
"hey these shitters won 15 years ago that proves my point". Wut?
---
Your point assumes they're playing as well as we will play in 2019 it's absurd. . DPS warriors tend to do more threat when letting loose and full buffed than tank warriors, surprise? 
---
Casters if they crit over and over again generate a shit ton of threat, surprise? 
---
Mathematical fact, windfury isn't gonna do you any good if you're playing the game well. Your tank is what is gonna slow you down in a single target engagement. Every time. 40 dudes only takes one getting crits to fuck up the agro table
---
That fight genuinely had me at the edge of my seat.
---
Kudos to everyone involved. Well played.
---
I would like to note that world firsts included videos showing how to accomplish the win. Horde not getting 90% of the lead up to final bosses and then landing that final kill could be attributed to seeing those. So, I would argue that it does matter and Alliance gets credit for their accomplishments. Horde don't win just because they got the final boss.
---
Alliance &gt; Horde once again
---
I dont even know what that means, because I quit playing WoW before it got that stupid.
---
I've read that only the demo they had a while back was on the 7.3 Legion client and now Classic is supposed to be on the BfA client.
---
PogU EZ Clap
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
Those hunters probably could have 3-manned it with the priest lmao. 
---
I was watching Soda on half screen and Asmo on the other and I feel like Soda's group actually played better for the most part but the double hunters made the difference. 
---
Sony was much better at actually getting aggro on shit, but that probably worked against them if anything.
---
I thought they were fucked whenever the Scarlet Champion patrol respawned but the hunters kited like monsters.
---
I love both holy paladin and resto druid and the reason I'll be rolling a holy pally main (although probably a druid alt too) is more to do with the druid lack of rez and the paladin's immense utility when compared.  Holy pally just brings a whole lot more to the table than just the best and most mana efficient heal in the game.  I dunno how your druid outlasted the pally mana wise in your test but probably because you didn't minmax the crit on the paladin.  Holy pally in t3 runnin around with maxxed crit is almost able to spam FoL max rank indefinitely wheras resto druids suffer from the rule of 5 far more.
---
Regardless, holy paladins just bring a whole lot more to the table than druids too.  Druid brings what, innervate and motw?  Not even really comparable with auras, Bosac, freedom, bom, bow, salv, bol, being ableto regen mana with SoW/BoW etc.
---
In pvp i think it's a tossup between resto druid and holy pala - obviously both bring different but equally useful kit.  However in pve I think pala wins overall due to a lot of the druid kit being not particularly useful in pve (eg: druids are the most mobile healer, does that matter in pvp?  hell yeah, does it matter in pve? not much).
---
Too soon Executus. You have awakened the fall semester too soon!
---
ayyy there it is!
---
who cares?
---
As a career priest, but soon fell into the tank role. This is god damn genius. I healedand tanked default UI just because I needed to keep Pace with my guild. Some of these people need to work for the freaking space program.
---
History shows Horde was better.
---
Private servers show Horde is better.
---
So now your argument is "I think Alliance will be better"
---
You must be an anti-vaxxer.
---
Same. I've done Horde on retail Vanilla-Wrath and a couple times on various private servers. I'm pretty tired of the barrens lol
---
You won't have as much leeway as you would as resto. 100% okay to heal any dungeon as long as your appropriately coordinated with your other party members.
---
This and the WSG matches have been so great to watch.  Classic is making me love WoW again.
---
Ha, good detective work. Almost a year sober now, though.
---
Doubtful but I will be far more efficient with my time.
---
It isn't. The BFA client has multi-threading support. The Classic client does not.
---
August can't come any sooner.
---
Wow, I have this exact pedal. Time to get some calf workouts in.
---
Those hunters carried so hard. Felt like Asmon and Esfand could have been replaced with any other competent player and it would have been completed.
---
hunters did all the work
---
"world first", cringe. Once live is out some random non-streaming neckbeards will world first everything.

Alliance get a lv11 quest in westfall for a wand.

And now you're scum.

Basically, pala was a dead weight, and they 4 manned it. I would imagine Razorfen Downs is doable, not sure about Zul'Farrak:)

There are no world firsts in this game.

&gt;If you go your entire life thinking "omg everyone likes pepperoni but I can't suggest that because WHAT IF PINEAPPLE?!?" you'll probably miss out on a whole lot of pepperoni for absolutely no reason, my dude.

I already have plenty of other games for that.  The implication that I'm not a risk taker because I want no changes in WoW Classic is hilarious.

PUMP IT UP!

4 hunter + priest would of been quicker, not even trolling...

Deep Elem Mines in the Silverpine Forest!

I've been leveling one on a pserver and it's pretty slow. You can kill one mob at a time pretty efficiently, but only a few in a row before you must eat/bandage, and rarely more than 1 at a time until you get Blade Flurry. Stealth is absolutely useless against mobs in the open world, at least until Distract. It's just no fun.
---
just take it slow, enjoy the experience for now
---
Fucking amazing kiting that whole run, and it SHOWED. While that was all happening, the Horde stream were trying their best but wiped time after time. It was Tortoise and the Hare and the Alliance Tortoise were just too strong. Fantastic stream.
---
They’d have wiped multiple times if it wasn’t for Esfand, the off heals, blessings and his lay on hands on the boss is the only reason they could even clear it. Also if asmon didn’t have sanctuary he would’ve died multiple times, pally didn’t do much damage but the support it brings is the only reason they got the boss down.
---
What is that called and where could I buy it
---
That hunter was great during Armoury and instrumental during Cathedral. Glad to see it's helping him kickstart a Twitch following!
---
They're probably gonna try all of the instances they can enter, talking about doing RFD tomorrow.
---
To be fair. I'm not anything because I haven't gotten a damn beta invite. Waste of $15 lol
---
That last fight was bananas, big ups to the hunters for keeping their shit together through it.
---
The hunters, particularly zeroed, were amazing.  Zeroed is one of the best players I've ever seen.
---
I agree when you resist a stun as an orc that is gg. 
---
But i disagree that the stun isnt useful. Stunning to get a heal or cast off is very nice when you have a melee on top of you.
---
I submit this as evidence https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZapYnHSSsQ
---
In general if you use a program to just like, extract all of the WoW music tracks, it's great to just make big playlists of WoW music for different themes.
---
I've been collecting all the 'energetic' or 'epic' WoW tracks for a raiding or dungeoning playlist if I don't just want to listen to House or whatnot.
---
Extracting music tends to yield a lot more tracks than getting the official sound tracks which are super trimmed. Alternatively, could just find the tracks on WoWhead but I feel like that takes longer.
---
... also, _Disturbed_, my guilty guilty pleasure.
---
About 100,000 people.
---
Correct answer!
---
Alt is my cast on self if targeting something else keybind.
---
The paladin did help off-healing on the last fight for sure...BoP and Lay on Hands made a big difference in getting it killed too. 
---
He's still bad, and a 3rd hunter probably would have made it even easier, but he wasn't really there to do damage.
---
That is so autistic it almost seems like a twitch chat copypasta, you dont have to roll out your weird 2004 game flex on me, because I really dont care what you think. I will play the game I love with the people I want, and we're going to have a blast doing it.
---

the game is 1.12 what are you talking about.

---
you no mess with Lo Wang.
---
lol, yep
---
Bitchin, thanks friend
---
yeah its pretty embarrassing to be one-shot by a skull rogue in redridge lmao
---
They're planning RFD and Uldaman.
---
Hahaha, I love it. I was thinking the same thing but I just gotta try to hold out. It's coming soon!
---
That’s true, I was like 10 when I started in vanilla. I don’t think I figured out that questing was how you gain experience and level up until I was like level 30..
---
&gt; it's about being something that pleases me in the best way
---
Sounds like you need someone to read your soul in order to give a meaningful advice :)
---
If you go human paladin, there're at least quite a few things to play with. Just don't be one of those paladins who pretend they're warriors and try to pwn BGs with 2h. Reck is fine for ganking but you need to build it.
---
Yeah sure thing, not arguing with you - buffs and auras comes handy, but if things dying faster, they're gonna do less damage that you have to heal aswell.
---
I'm expecting RFD to be a little easier than Cath oddly enough but I think that'll be the end; I can't see Uldaman being possible at 30, it's a pretty challenging dungeon even if only slightly underlevelled.
---
I’ve never had more fun playing a game in my entire life than the first year I played World of Warcraft. One of my buddies in high school would talk about farming in west fall to me and my best friend and I remember asking “so it’s a farming game? Like harvest moon?”. He laughed and explained what he meant and showed us the game once or twice. I finally convinced my parents to get the game and a subscription and I’ve never looked back.
---
It was really intense last fight, Asmons group planned for the last boss. Sodas group just winged it. The results showed. Also, the two hunters in Asmons group were really good.
---
Yeah you do you but that's just strawmaning, at least you acknowledge that ret sucks since you refer to wanting to have fun.
---
It's fine in off itself, reaching r14 is all about quedodging anyway.
---
THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY INSANE.
---
TheMechanic's stream is SO fun to watch, but I gotta say, whatever you may think about the attitudes of some of these people, their skills were on full display here. When they pulled that scarlet champion? That'd wipe so many groups (consider too that they're level frickin 30 in Scarlett Monastery Cathedral!), but these boys handled it like absolute champions. Congrats to this awesome team. 
---
RFD is gonna feel like Kel Thusad haha, but that's not to say they can't do it!
---
From physical cocaine to digital cocaine. At least that's progress!
---
oh true
---
Well asmongold isn’t a good player (despite what people think) so replacing him in any situation will help.
---
Is it as toxic as barrens chat?

Private servers show alliance was vastly better....
---
lol
---
Do you play on p servers? What are you smoking?
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Speedrun/Default.aspx
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Speedrun/Default.aspx  (salad bakers is a troll guild, i'm sure they pre cleared or something to get it that low lol, some good pvpers but not the types to legit push raid clear times)
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Speedrun/Default.aspx (i would bet money those good horde times were made with better gear than the alliance runs)
---
And there are no stats out for Naxx yet
---
I could see how if you didn't play you might believe that after seeing a horde guild get 25 minute MC in AQ gear...lol but that's not really relevant as soon as you realize what they were doing
---
Notice how Nefarious still hasn't beaten APES BWL clear time months later? In much better gear?
---
i think your ignoring the off heals blessing lay on hands bops and other utility that esfand brought to the table bud. no they didn't effectively 4 man the dungeon
---
Back in the day when you actually NEEDED accessories with extra buttons for all your weird macros and hotkeys!!!!
---
Yes the stun is useful but you got engineering to cover that via nades, or other things, and the orc resist is much more impactful (and happens more frequently). Reminder that orc can also resist grenades etc which is huge.
---
How many across all instance? I truly thought elites were tougher back in the day.
---
Last boss was a skull :(
---
Stealth feels a little better on the beta. On private servers I needed some points in improved stealth due to mobs detecting me so much easier, this hasn't been needed as much on the beta, its a lot more forgiving.
---
IMO this would only be worth it if multiple people work together and feed 1 person mats to make everyone wands.
---
Sort of, Esfands healing and bops and stuff were relevant. He would have been more useful as holy in the roll he was performing but he was hardly useless.
---
Yeah, OP never said anything about converting classic into TBC... no idea where that's coming from.
---
As for fiscal viability - got any hard data you're referencing? Because the site I'm looking at shows WotLK &amp; classic as the same ballpark player count. TBC lagging behind, but still very noticeable. (I'd link the site, but rule 4 is strict.) 
---
tl;dr from this page I see no reason to believe classic is any more or less viable than wotlk.
---
alliance zones are better for ganking, i. e. redridge/duskwood/wetlands
---
Uldaman final boss would wipe the floor with them.
---
I've done somewhat similar stuff in SM back in Vanilla later on in its lifecycle, but if they fucking clear Uldaman at level 30 I'll get a tattoo if Asmongold on my asscheek. I don't think they'd make it to the last boss, but if they did he would absolutely plunder them...there is no way to cheese that shit.
---
https://i.imgur.com/pVBMl2y.jpg
---
You stated, and I quote: "but ele shaman isn't a healer..". 
---
In Vanilla WoW any class that had spells that could heal others was treated as a healer in raids, regardless of spec. This is just a historical fact. Look at the tier sets for shamans, druids, and paladins. The evidence is right there.
---
That's not to say that there weren't some corner cases of a Ret Paladin doing DPS or a feral druid getting to off tank(etc. Etc.), but these are the exceptions to the rule not the norm.
---
Probably, but streamers have the free resource advantage. Their viewers are out there farming stuff and giving them the benefits for free.

1x is barely a drizzle, 3x is proper rain

Where is Asmon's stream?  This is lame pov.
---
lvl 30 content is super refreshing because it's actually a new meta.
---
shhhhh no real talk here only speculation
---
Depends on the day
---
The lay on hands during the last fight saved a wipe. Off heals, wisdom and might buffs, bubbles, Giving sanctuary so they didnt pull aggro. All of that helped them clear the dungeon. Vanilla is more than simply dps meters.
---
except the paladin carried them on the most important part, the final boss. Bop and lay on hands saved them
---
Say what you will about BFA but the art team is always on point and is always carrying the other teams.
---
0 deaths.
---
it was a SM run calm down buddy
---
True as well.
---
Lucky charms. Nice.
---
Why do people buy steel lockboxes?
---
Isn't the final boss in Uldaman like lvl 50? Pretty brutal :D
---
They died 0 times during cath? damnn
---
Yeah its awsome to see that they are treating it as endgame while just being capped at 30.
---
meh, boring :/
---
&gt; Notice how Nefarious still hasn't beaten APES BWL clear time months later?
---
Nefarious hasn't, but Vanguard has.
---
Your argument: "The numbers do show Horde is better, but I'm willing to bet, based on nothing but my opinion, that the Horde cheated some how".
---
Okay buddy.
---
6 days? Nice. You should be at least level 20 by the time you go back to work.
---
that's sad
---
Can’t find a decent 32 in ultrawide with a decent response time and refresh rate
---
true but I watched him do wsg also.  He is great
---
You can enjoy the game as a casual but the difference between a hardcore player and casual is massive. In retail you can have similar gear to someone who plays all the time if you’re only casual. In Vanilla someone who no life’s the game is going to two shot you. So if you want to play casually just remember that you aren’t going to be competitive at anything compared to a hardcore player.
---
I, uh, may have built my own custom footpad controller using an Arduino Micro as a USB joystick.

It started out for voice comms, without having to tie up a finger to hold down a press-to-talk key.

It was surprisingly easy to do. I may have to resurrect it for Classic.

He deleted his vod.

You've yet to illustrate the problem. This is the problem. You have failed to provide proof of the problem. That's what everyone is trying to tell you. Stop trying to sound intelligent with philosophy 101 and instead consider your argument is unfinished and thus has zero merit.
---
Our dev team is larger than it was in early WoW and the news team handles the handful of social media tweets, we don't have a full-time team for that :) Guides were always around since vanilla, like Allakhazam, and the news team will also be help growing the guide section with writers and making sure they have nice formatting to drive more clicks back to the database. Armory can't be worked on without an API (I asked about this at the media summit, was told not for Classic Launch) but we'd just port over the existing tracker technology, with minor tweaks, if we had access to one. Transmog I think you mean model viewer and that's a similar situation, framework was already there on the BFA site, ported it over, we haven't needed to do any updates to it since November 2018.
---
Database is very much a priority for us and we're seeing some good traction on talent calc and spell data so far.
---
are you serious? ele shaman treated as a healer in raids.. cant take anything you say serious after that. bahahahha
---
One of the best parts about Vanilla is the different brackets leveling up and how the game changes in each one. It never really felt like it was just a means to an end...it was very fun to step aside and do some stuff along the way.
---
That always happens though. Most people invested in retail praise Legion now, but 7.0 had serious issues that were later smoothed out. It's an endless cycle that some of us accept, and others don't.
---
The strength of Classic is being a time capsule.
---
they didnt have a single death
---
  Dual leveling combos are typically classes that have a weakness that is compensated by the other. Warriors/Warlocks are the two that benefit the most, because they both rely on health, which can be healed. Druids pop out to heal themselves, and priests have imp wands, so your leveling speed should be great anyway. 
---
  I wouldnt worry about dungeon comps for speed leveling. By the time you get the quests to make them worth running, you are past the optimal lvl anyhow. They take too long, and if you are doing well there shouldnt be anyone to group with anyway.
---
They left the stress test up for 24 hours. I played for 6 hours the next day before the servers went down.. So there was certainly a window where it was easy to get in before they took the servers back down.
---

---
I forced myself to open the top 20 posts. I feel I have accomplished a great feat....
---
I've seen some things.... O.O
---
They're capped at 30.
---
True which is why most people herald wotlk as the beginning of the end and the ending of the “Classic” era
---
Do you think the game will have a bunch of casuals this time around, like it did back in the day? Specifically, will I run into goofy old retirees who have no idea what they are doing and are just fun to play with? That kind of thing seemed to die after Vanilla and I hope it comes back.
---
The world first was fourteen and a half years ago.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply, I'm running it by the dev team to see if having uploads, whenever max-level content opens, will update this :)
---
Love the game music playing. Made it feel epic
---
They clearly said that it's decreasing, not stopping. And that they would be reevaluating, which means that any time they could decide they want more testers. No reason to be such a negative Nancy.
---
The slower the weapon the harder whirlwind and mortal strike hit. They are based purely off damage range so slow weapons are king.
---
Asmons group planned everything they were going to do while Soda's group messed around, begging for gold, argued and whined about about their talent trees and abilities then winged it and wiped several times.
---
Right? Glad I’m not the only one that thinks so. So annoying seeing “world first” tagged into everything
---
Super fun to watch. Though I felt the entirety of their Armory run was more tense just due to how close knit the mob areas were with the respawn. But the final boss in Cathedral executed perfectly by the Hunters even after pulling the extra mob
---
So, something like this?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A_zUxATP0DTAAA
---
Nothing but Nickleback...
---
What’s the twitch name of the hunter, been looking for a classic Hunter to watch.     
---
Thanks
---
I was legally required to spend 8 hours in school back then and had parental figures telling me not to waste so much time on "those damn video games".
---
Not so anymore.
---
0 wipes
---
Zero wipes, zero deaths
---
Very impressive
---
They are all level 30. Trash was 38-40. Bosses were 42.
---
To be fair they did use a 2 Hunter setup which Soda opted to not do because 1. It's already known hunters are broken and 2. They're having some speedrunning tournament later where multi-classing isn't allowed (otherwise everyone would just stack hunters), so they didn't want to be spergs and stack the most broken DPS class at the moment. 
---
Also didn't help that Nick's brain stopped functioning before he even joined the instance LUL
---
its not just the clearing of these dungeons, but its the passion that these guys are playing with.  It is creating such a positive experience for everyone involved.  cant wait
---
I don't acknowledge that, are you actually not capable of understanding anything? Is holy better for r14 pvp? YES. Does that mean ret sucks? NO. Does it play differently than holy? YES. Is it plain worse? NO. Does it have its place in comps? YES. Is it optimal for all comps? NO. Should people care about it? NO. Why? Because it is a game.
---
&gt;it will say "Beta" or "Beta &amp; Stress"
---
but what if you got into the stress test? Will we eventually see it just say "Beta" when we get in? Or will it stay as "Beta &amp; Stress Test"
---
I am fortunate enough to be able to play all day but I likely will not. I think 8 hours a day is the most I will ever really put in
---
That's actually really surprising to me. Don't get me wrong I am not a nostalgia blind supporter claiming a high difficulty curve for Classic but 8+ levels PLUS the mobs being elite? 
---
They're skilled players and with "BiS" for level 30 and all but damn.
---
I think they will man. I think they can do RFD for sure, I don't think Uldaman will be doable, and I almost think that Mara, though harder than Uldaman for the most part, might be doable since Princess is extremely kitable, so if they can get there, they can get it done. 
---
RFD for sure though. Calling it now.
---
LUL Horde
---
Level 30 cap has lead to some fantastic content.
---
Would this have been easier if Esfand went Holy or if he were replaced with another Hunter?
---
Right, dualwielding didnt come around till TBC lol. It's been a minute since I've played. 
---
And shadows still synergize with locks very.
---
Also Spriests are monsterous when encountered 1v1 in bgs with their kit rotation doing disgusting amounts of dps.
---
If you rolled dwarf priest for fear ward, then went shadow, you'd be a terrifying force, you were also capable of being on the fly support.
---
Their main issue was being mana starved all the time.
---
Unlikely.
---
It's odd. Individually I like Tauren most, their zone, city, hubs, model etc. However, as a whole I think I prefer Alliance. Their aesthetic meshes together better imo. Still undecided honestly.
---
No they have dates \*mind blown\*
---
So some of them I know what happened. Apes clear time is 2 months before Nefarious's where they obviously tried to beat APES time and failed in BWL. Succeeded in MC. Look at teh dates
---
Salad bakers are the only ones who I said "cheated" lol
---
And they are generally open about it when asked. They would laugh if you knew you were making this argument with their clear time. Hahahaha. I pvp'd a lot with a french guy who raids with them. There's is the only anomalous one. Rest are believable 
---
You obviously don't play on the p servers. Or don't anymore anyway. 
---
Apes is clearly the better guild between them and nefarious. But WAYYYY closer to the ceiling than the clicker guilds you're referencing from actual vanilla 
---
Apes isn't full try hard PvEing and I doubt Nefarious is either. So still far from ceiling Just pointing out you clearly have no idea waht you're talkig about.
---
Its just to trigger idiots
---
The best of all was how salty horde was when alliance downed them first. They were ripping into each other on discord, rofl.
---
yeah i was legitimately impressed, especially when the champion respawned during the boss fight and they pulled it
---
I think he meant the content they were doing is level 40 (or close to it)
---
It’s not triggering anyone. Just makes them look desperate for clicks and views.
---
then you dont understand the utility of what the pally brings
---
I actually have something similar but mine only has two pedals and I mainly use it for mounts and push to talk in discord.

You’re commenting lol. That’s the sad part
---
I highly recommend his 4 part series on famous and infamous people of WoW
---
yet here you are comenting on it
---
You only get blind once
---
They are basically in epics for their level to be fair
---
APES doesn't have a single speedrun record.
---
That was amazing to watch. What is going to happen is that this will make everyone think these instances are easy but in reality, these guys a pro hunters, everyone has BiS for the level and it was all very well coordinated. A normal classic run, almost no one will be in Vent, almost no one in the group will have BiS gear, and very few people if any will be a pro at their class.
---
FUN DETECTED
---
Yeah no way this is quicker than just levelling normally and getting a wand when you normally can off vendor or quest.
---
I think its a no brainer to put the 11 into ret for seal of command.  I did ok in PvP as a shockadin with seal of command. Heal most of the time and when stun is ready go in for the kill. Auto attack, Stun judge of command, auto again, Insta crit holy shock and finish with the range execute
---
🎵 **STEALTH PERFECTED⠀**
---
they literally got a respawn during the morgaine fight lmao, much more intense than herod
---
And?
---
&gt; 1. Where can I find a hardcore PvP &amp; PvE guild that is looking to start on day 1 for a Los Angeles server? 
---
Check discords and the Reddit looking for group threads I'd say. There's plenty of people making guilds in preparation for classic.
---
&gt;2. What addons will be available on day 1?
---
No one knows for sure but we know big add-ons like elvui will be adapting their add-ons for classic
---
&gt; 3. What are a few things you'll be able to monopolize when starting on day 1?
---
Depends on what you mean. For gold I'd say vendor recipes. It takes basically 0 effort to get them (besides being their when they respawn), and you instantly make a profit selling them on the ah
---
&gt;worry about dungeon comps for speed leveling. By the time you get the quests to make them worth running, you are past the optimal lvl anyhow. They take too long, and if you are doing well there shouldnt be
---
Hey Foe, thanks for the feedback, our main motivation for this combo was having a healer/tank for endgame dungeons. Obviously warrior would be a decent stand in for the druid at this point, but we kinda figured that if something goes awry that the extra heals/rez will allow us to continue with less down time overall, plus druid gives some more flexibility whilst leveling and eventually for tanking/healing/dps in dungeons and pvp compared to the warrior. 
---
Its not the most optimal team, it just seemed odd that no one really talks about it as an option compared to war/priest, lock/pally, pally/warr etc. Im hoping we level fast enough to be ahead of the curve, but its likely that we will get caught at level 40+ as our lives grant us less time to be totally devoted to speeding all the way to 60. So being able to run the higher dungeons just needing 3 dps for the last 20 levels would be a big advantage i would hope.
---
In all seriousness though, does WoW recognize gamepads? And would these type of peripherals be considered "gamepads" by the computer?
---
Where is Mankirk's wife?
---
gonna need a hot take from /u/awesometographer on this one.
---
great post tyvm
---
I'd love to see some data as I'd think stealth would speed up quite a few quests.
---
1. In the weekly "Looking for Group Monday" threads linked on the sidebar.
---
2. https://willitclassic.com/
---
3. They wouldn't be very lucrative if we didn't keep them a secret.
---
Maybe, but it also comes down to the skill of the hunter. The beta is already a pretty limited invite, they might not have another geared and ready hunter they know.
---
This will be my guild name thank you.
---
Best era for trance imo
---
This is my favorite comment chain
---
No way the healer could have kept those hunters alive. not in a million
---
Asmons group planned ahead for everything they were going to do. While Soda's group messed around, begged for gold, argued and whined about about their talent trees and abilities. They finally decided to wing it, wiping several times and continue to wipe on the last boss long after Asmons group finished while still arguing and insulting each other.
---
Interesting. I ran into the same problem on Pserver. Thanks for the info!
---
I just use Shift+1/2/3
---
False, it is a separate chest piece and skirt.
---
it can be done a lot more efficiently than you think. guesstimating the crafting time (should be close to this), we get:
---
* 30 bolts * 3 sec = 90 sec
---
*  9 robes * 5 sec = 45 sec
---
* 8 d/e * 3 sec = 24 sec.
---
* 1 runed copper rod = 5 sec
---
* 1 wand = 5 sec
---
for a total of 3min 10sec. add in a generous 30 sec for training the profs along your route and looting the d/e materials and you're still under 4 minutes for a nice wand at level 10.
---
Same
---
&gt;RFD is gonna feel like Kel Thusad haha, but that's not to say they can't do it!
---
huh?
---
What is the use for tigers fury in a feral druid? During dungeons? During levelling?
---
Thanks for the response. If I understand correctly you're saying that Goblin would be the better choice overall, but if you can afford it then you should go Gnomish for BoP items and then respec to Goblin? Is this a feasible thing to do at the start of Classic?
---
Fucking rip
---
I personally prefer dwarf because they have amazing racials and they do not have to play vs paladins, devouring plague and shadow word pain both get removed by 1 cleanse. Stoneform removing blind is so good
---
I played stress test with a Intel HD 4000 on board graphics. I only got \~20 FPS at 1080p. On private servers I get at least 40 FPS.
---
Something about the legion client's architecture seems to be more demanding than the original vanilla 1.12 client.
---
vanilla didn't come out 15 years ago that's one, and two it ended less than 12.5 years ago, so do the math now genius
---
lol Soda tries  to make up so many rules and other bullshit. So he has excuses no matter what.
---
Soda's group just killed it and they were flailing the entire time. Any mistake that was made during the pull they could just talk through it. There's no quick decisions and the fact that it can be easily killed by players at their level is just further proof that this shit is nowhere near as hard as players are remembering. The average player now is just so much better and knowledgeable.
---
if only...
---
I made a couple during  stress test and they are saved locally:

---
completing the silverpine quest is not a better alternative to making the wand. it's an elite quest that's part of a chain, and you'll want the wand long before you get to this point.
---
It’s all about doing things you love; as long as those things aren’t highly addictive narcotics.
---
Same here, I still have the video downloaded and watch it occasionally.
---
What gear did you have? What speed runs are you comparing them to? It's already inherently unfair because you can't choose the loot that drops. 
---
It only matters on the same clear on the same server and in the same time frame, ideally the same lockout. Just discounting all the discrepancies between private servers.
---
Having a speed run with naxx gear in MC is meaningless. lol
---
They dominate the biggest server. You have the speed run record for your server. It doesn't transfer over to other servers. Like I said it doesn't even matter if the date is too far apart. 
---
They don't take it seriously. And still dominate the server. Got gnome warriors.
---
Ive said since day one of classic announcement. This will be how the first MC clear will go down.
---
Hpala does really good healing, really efficient, and pally buffs are great too.
---
But you're here complaining about it.
---
Hi! I would say there's no tier list because there's so many kinds of situations you can consider to be PvP and the game changes drastically as you go from early 60 to naxx/hwl gear
---
**Large scale:** Mages/Hunters
---
**BGs:** I've ran with about every Rank14 Horde on Firetree server (Reckoning) Vanilla, we wouldn't run premade bgs without warriors or shamans, you want shadow priests or mages on your offensive and rogues/hunters/warlocks/druids on your defense.
---
**Duels:** This game is super gear dependent, rogues/locks/spriests are low econ, warriors/mages scale very well - I would never lose a duel, but I had five sets of gear from rank14 and naxx as a warrior
---
**Solo WPvP:** rogues of course, warlocks can drop infernals on your head in sticky situations and good mages can get out of sticky situations with polymorph
---
&gt;Draw backs of classic wow
---
&gt; -classic wow with microtransactions 
---
Citation needed. You just pulled that out of your ass.
---
Part of a chain that you will do naturally while leveling in the zone. Not hard to find a couple other people who want to do it too. You can level to 15 no problem without a wand.
---
Upvoted for visibility.
---
&gt; Probably better to just group up and go grind level 6 mobs outside of the starter zone.
---
Have you done the math? [I have](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/alu1bz/dumb_thursday_math_rushing_out_of_starting_zone/)
---
Esfand being a MVP with that Lay of Hands, also both hunters (Mechanic and Zero ) were amasing  both in the boss and the trash pulls
---
Wow that's really interesting. Great catch. You have my vote for a beta key lol.
---
Holy shit, Esfand is seriously impressive!
---
That last fight may be the best paladin gameplay I've seen in a long time.
---
I have 2 kids, 3yo and 1yo and a job that actually requires me to commute. Back then I was a bartender and going to college... safe to say I will be a fresh lv60 in 3 months as opposed to already raiding MC and Onyxia in 3 months.
---
The warrior should probably just go dps spec next time. Due to the high miss chance he wasn't really able to do much tanking in there.
---
if you're speedlevelling, the only other people in the zone will be other speedlevellers -- everyone will be skipping this quest. additionally, the value of the LMW can't be overstated from level 10-15; it does more dps then your spells can even do, for no mana.
---
That's asinine from a development perspective. They are the most familiar with Vanilla...
---
Swifty always had the gas pedal
---
By that argument, Usain Bolt's world records don't matter because they weren't run in 1912.
---
Get real.

---
Troll level 0
---
I had this exact set of pedals. Used one of them to modify all spells into mouseovers. Used another for push-to-talk. Can't remember what I used the other for. Muscle memory always overpowered tho and so I never really took to using them.
---
Annnnd I couldn't even finish this comment before looking for those old pedals again. Going to give them another try.
---
Being 11 and an idiot. I remember very little of classic. I killed baron geddon and then was quickly kicked for being a durp.  I had no idea what I was doing. I feel like I'm still going in one eye blind.
---
Nah, use it for class fantasy. Thunder clap or fan of knives, something thatll feel cool when you put your foot down.

Tagging this for later, thanks for the resource!

---
What discord are you on? Would love to chat more
---
It's a meme. Sorry you didn't get beta access.
---
rilly maks u think
---
Normal range is 10-12 days played to get to 60 iirc. Obviously this will depend alot on what you do with your time, if you put a lot into professions it may be longer. I'd recommend finding a large guild if you have no irl wow friends. Warriors in particular benefit a lot from having a healer leveling partner as they end up with basically no down time
---
Everything in WoW is exaggerated.  That's the art style.  It creates a grand scale and it works.  Few other games from 2004 hold up to today's standards of visual design.
---
I have beta access. I'm using it to create the LFG addon you're all going to hate to use but use anyway.
---
I want a to be able to pvp with the gear I earn in raids too. Resilience ruined much of the game for people who like to do both.
---
For certain, and some drowning pool
---
They also can double for the infamous lag switch too
---
Did that during nost launch. Not worth it
---
https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=207
---
Shaman tier 1. You can look at all the other tier sets from there as well, but they'll only serve to reinforce my argument.
---
The shaman tier sets were designed to help them perform their expected role in a raid. You'll notice on that set that the bonuses only affect friendly beneficial totem effects and healing spells. Also, only 2 pieces even have bonus damage on them, the rest are exclusively bonus healing.
---
I'm not saying that an elemental shaman can't do damage, but if you think that's what you're going to be doing full time in raids in classic then you've got another thing coming.
---
This is on a whole other level, I want some!
---
Gotta keep in mind back then a lot of people were absolutely clueless. Where people now have the knowledge, the experience(from private servers), and tips and tricks to their classes. They're going to be far more efficient.
---
I honestly think an hour a day with a few during raid nights is good enough.
---
Yeah I was right on top of him
---
I tell everyone to do it. I'm gonna do it.
---
Paul:
---
- Do the quests
---
- if not grind
---
- Then exploration
---
If you can't quest, you can't grind. If there's more than a few handfuls of players around, both are not legit options with like 2 dozen others in the starting zone.
---
I'm going to do it.
---
I'm making guides for other people to do it.
---
Don't like it? Don't do it. We'll just be a bit ahead of you in even remotely populated starts.
---
Plus, my blood pressure stays low and reasonable for the first 10-15 levels.
---
Im a 28 year old guy and sit legs crossed in my office chair
---
What makes this so impressive, is that they're clearing classic SM at level 30. Most players don't clear this until around the late 30's. 
---
Granted, they're essentially twinking at level 30 because of the cap, but even then it's still super impressive, due to how hit works. Awesome job all round.
---
lmao
---
They accidentally pulled a sorcerer during Herod too
---
in retail you buy a potion that makes the sky really dark. search for '' inky black potion screenshots'' on google
---
Thank you for running those PUGs. I played vanilla but didn't have a lot of time for raiding and only got into MC through PUGs (same with ZG). Hopefully I can find the same on an Oceania server this time round.
---
You are easily influenced aren’t you
---
I sure hope so, this has been something I’ve looked forward too for a long time, I really want to be able to do all the endgame but I can’t realistically commit crazy amounts of time with school/work.
---
it’s almost like he’s trolling 🤔
---
Fuck you nerds gotta get off streamer's dicks.
---
Wow, they cleared old content that has been in the game for 15 years. They were just a little bit underleveled.
---
SUCH. AN. ACCOMPLISHMENT.
---
LETS ALL LIKE SUBSCRIBE AND BE A PART OF THEIR COMMUNITY.
---
Fucking losers.
---
&gt; In all seriousness though, does WoW recognize gamepads? And would these type of peripherals be considered "gamepads" by the computer?
---
Unless something changed later in Bfa, there's no official gamepad support at all with WoW.
---
However, there's a good variety of programs that translate gamepad/controller/joystick input to keyboard and mouse input. My favorite is AntiMicro (it's cross-platform with Windows and Linux, and open-source). A popular older program is Xpadder. I believe Steam also has some kind of method as well.
---
Ret still sucks.
---
It also has no place in any comp, even r14 grinders from recent privates say so (who played with or as ret).
---
..checks user name..
---
...ok bye...
---
I'm definitely for no changes to classic but if there was a modern/classic graphics toggle button, I'd be ok with it.  That option wouldnt actually affect the game or even be noticable to those who opt out.

## [Blood &amp; Honey] 
---
 (Alliance/RP-Pvx/NA)   
---
Who we are:
---
 \-Blood &amp; Honey...oh were do I begin?  
---
B&amp;H is a clan of like minded individuals who don't take themselves too seriously.  That being said we do spent countless hours in Azeroth.  My vision for B&amp;H is to be at the very forefront of putting on fun community events and absolutely destroying all Horde in our way in world pvp and battlegrounds.  
---
We are also competent raiders  who strive to be known as knowledgeable and dedicated, but don't ever expect to be a world first at anything but binge drinking.   
---
Our Philosophy: 
---
\-Have fun and be involved.  I know most of us are far removed from the first time we played Classic so it can be hard to truly get involved like we used to.  I only ask that when you are in Azeroth you are willing and able to help the Clan and create a small online family that we can all be proud of.  
---
RP is only required during specific events that we put on in the server, but it is encouraged whenever you feel like it in order to truly enhance your experience.)   Schedule for future raiding: -TBD.... I will not decide this without feedback from every single member of the Clan.  We are a cohesive unit and family and the leadership will do their best to make sure everyone is somehow involved at raiding and events at least once a week!

It's worth noting that the 5% crit for holy spells from Holy Power at the top of the Holy tree is *really* good synergy with Illumination, because it basically means that an extra 5% of your healing spells cost 0 mana.
---
It’s not his. This picture belongs to the streamer Sequisha. His mustache is awesome.
---
My only issue, and I totally get WHY he does it, but I don't like Madseason's fake cam, it's just kind of distracting and covers up screen real estate.
---
That said I still am glad he got in and I've loved watching him play
---
What about weather effects? Are we getting blizzards, sandstorms &amp; heavy rainfall back?
---
LONG HAVE WE AWAITED
---
They are far from average.  Every person in Asmon's and Soda's stream have played PvE and/or PvP at a high level.  The average player does LFR.
---
I knew this race was over as soon as I saw Soda's scuffed comp with a rogue and druid dps while Asmon's group had 2 geared hunters.
---
Which one?
---
for real,  I was thinking about the idea of ​​being a competent support, but eventually giving some bursts
---
Asmon got gifted like 30 gold. Its not like he doesnt beg

thank you!!!
---
How big is your chair?
---
I'm similar stats (well, I'm a few inches shorter) but the idea of sitting cross legged in my chair is just... that's an accident waiting to happen.
---
I used to use a foot pedal for my Ventrilo PTT key. Couldn't spare a finger to hold down a key during BT progression.
---
I don't even think he's trolling. 
---
He's just so autistic he didn't even know Asmon was trolling.
---
I love when he pumps this
---
The funny part is that Soda is two faced and makes fun of others for it. Then resorts to it himself.
---
The real hero
---
Don't the ambient sounds/music change too depending on what time of day it is?
---
God I can't wait to see old Azeroth again.
---
I want to have to turn my head to check the minimap damnit
---
No possible way. I had all day to play WoW when vanilla came out. As it is the 2-4 hours a day I plan on putting in the game is already a huge commitment for me.
---
I used one back in the day. $8 online for a single USB pedal.
---
Did you see the people in Soda's group try to raid Mythic Emerald Nightmare at the beginning of Legion? They were all very poopoo doodoo in an extremely easy raid. I wouldn't say they play any version of the game at 'a high level'
---
No.
---
Well we d never do farm first during prog for one
---
Perfectly fine for me, but I used it for Vent PTT.
---
You really are the final boss of reddit. Fine, I cannot convince someone set in their ways. But for anyone who might read this afterwards, just know that you can play whatever you want in vanilla, reach r14 and do all content. You dont need math and spreadsheets to play a 15 year old game.
---
who give a shit cry baby just stop or ....
---
But they took a ret paladin...
---
Can you link me to a working version and I'll add it asap!
---
If you are looking for a working version, I recommend asking in the classic wow discord
---
Don't get me wrong I'm also gonna do it just wanted to see if you still think it's the way to go. Personally I'm trying to figure out efficient quests I might do if I'm in a good spot or get in early.
---
I always thought [Nyhm](https://www.youtube.com/user/phrog801/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid) had the best wow videos.
---
There was a time when I had all of 1-6, shift, alt, and Ctrl 1-6, F1-F6, and tilde bound. And I needed all of that badly enough that I bought a single pedal to be my Ventrilo PTT button.
---
Already did all that. I'm asking for what about ingame stuff.
---
System of a Down
---
Meh, it was the Hordes that made it into a race. Asmon and Esfand and their two Hunters came there set up to actually clear the dungeon, not rush through it.
---
same bud
---
Desire - Priests are always going to be more desired than rogues, even if they're shadow. 
---
Strength - Rogues are going to be a lot better in 1vs1s because most 1v1 situations are you out in the open with zero preparation. You can't be camped as a rogue and you can be easily camped as a priest. In a fully prepared 1v1 situation the shadowpriest will have the upperhand, but that'll be rare. If your goal is to be relevant in group PvP I recommend the facemelter.

That's part of his act man. He trolls.
---
Themechanic
---
I personally liked the "fun of levelling" metric even though it is arbitrary. I'd say that levelling a paladin is low on the fun scale compared to aoe pulling as a mage. I know it's subjective, but still. Maybe a compromise could be "style of play" or "stress level."
---
OP fell for deadpan troll delivery, and is such a hater he had to post it here.
---
Or perhaps he's ascended to a level of trolling beyond that and is only pretending to be retarded
---
And we thank you for it! Vqueue? Or similar?
---
Casual? The hardest WotLK content is miles ahead of vanilla. Classic is strong BECAUSE it is casual, and easy. It's about the journey. For hard as nails content, both WotLK and BFA have Classic beat.
---
Esfand specced to buff the hunters and priest to increase their potency. Also remember that he can seal prevent fleeing on top of having DI, Lay on hands and BoP. His utility as he specced were great
---
Wait...is stance dancing back!?
---
Soda, Nmp and Sony are all pretty high level PvPers
---
The "Inky Black Potion" look is exactly how I remember vanilla Duskwood, and it's not just my imagination. Some time after TBC the lighting changed in the entire game.
---
I’ll post a picture when I get back to my office.
---
Did you just analogize sports with your physical body to a tab targeting MMO? lol
---
There is a GCD here dude, you can map it out mathematically and expect your players to reach that ceiling
---
There is no skill or talent ceiling for running a race...lol
---
I'm strictly playing classes I didn't in Vanilla-WotLK until I have a decent roster
---
I think 3 of the 5 members in that group were Gladiator at one point.
---
They have not said anywhere that there will be starter zone specific layering.
---
To get the lock picking skill up
---
He is obviously using mith seeds to slide out from under your freeze, he doesnt want you to log before his clan gets here.
---
yet you're still here
---
None of the races you’ve stated can play Druid FYI.
---
Plenty of BiS gear, specifically specced to survive it. Good players and plenty of coordination on comms. The average joe wouldnt do that man
---
Clearly I’ve been out of the loop!
---
The illustrations to the problem are in the OP illustrated in 4 entirely different fashions. 
---
Look at the course of events from your posts you've stated: 
---
1) I presented no actual evidence
---
2) I am the only one with the burden of proof
---
3) I haven't illustrated the problem
---
What has failed is the objection not towards the 'Problem' but towards ME with each post simultaneously sharing that you are completely agnostic to my position. What has no merit is the awareness your posts emanate towards doing anything other then deceiving yourself into fiction. Thank you for your time
---
"If you're speedlevelling", so your point is not really applicable to 99.9% of people.
---
I get it dude, you practice on repack getting sub 2 hour in UD zone. You think you are a hardcore speed leveller. Classic launch is going to be completely different.
---
/wave
---
If you could give some direction on what you're not understanding (which often is impossible, I know!), people around here might be able to help a little more.
---
Do you have a list of words that you don't know, or concepts you're finding confusing?
---
Sony is actually good at PvP, I'll give you that. Soda and nmp are not.
---
You have much to learn young WoWling
---
The most iconic part of The Barrens is Barrens Chat.
---
You are Definitely autistic though! 😂😂😂
---
Perfect, can't wait to reserve Who, You, and What
---
yes
---
This is what I'm thinking, I have the triple pedal heel towing gas blipping wanna be fast and furious skills required to do this. 
---
Now I'm just curious if my g27 pedals and shifter will work.
---
I doubt people think he's a good player, pretty much his whole fanbase was roasting him after he played the Soulsborne games. All the "literal god" stuff is obviously a joke.
---
i got a greater magic wand on beta at level 15 with roughly the method in OP.  definitely worth (for priest at least) considering you wont replace until mid 20s if youre speed leveling
---
Could almost be considered the best start
---
Same, 24 y/o dude, 6’ tall, almost always cross legged at my desk
---
I always felt like RFD was significantly harder than SM Cath, but I guess Mograine was higher level than Amnemar.  
---
Uld would wreck them though for sure.
---
But banning the other faction from an entire zone is probably the most gratifying thing you can do in WoW.

---
my guild leader uses foot pedals lol
---
47--5 levels higher than Mograine.  And they could hardly hit him.
---
For everything up to endgame you can comfortably run enhancement. Hell if you get in a good enough guild maybe they’ll take you as a windfury bot.
---
It is... But you have to keep in mind that classic is designed to be a slow and grindy kind of game. This is due to technology limitations at the time.
---
I will admit live does have significantly more quality of life aspects to it. But for many in the classic community we feel all those quality of life aspects just were not adding to our enjoyment of the game and were actually detracting from the experience.
---
That said it is very simple and easy to grasp and enjoyable if you aren't addicted to instant gratification.
---
It's not this dark anywhere in the game.
---
Agree, the turquoise might fit better. But also purple hair is unique to Night elves!
---
Pet would be the one tanking.
---
Thank you. I'm considering this myself and it seems like I could manage...
---
Soda was one of the top pvpers and still is.
---
&gt;lso with an alt on the backburner you can cash in rested XP more easily for a lower /played.
---
I fully plan on taking advantage of rested.   So we know the phase breakdown but dont know the timeline yet? I think i'll have to be watching for this. Thank you!
---
Even me who don't watch Asmon's stream very often knows that he's being sarcastic.
---
For sure. Those are the people who aren't constantly posting here in the reddit or watching streams most likely. Only a very small portion of the people who will be playing are posting about the game, and due to it being such a cultural phenomenon, there will definitely be a good chunk of newer players
---
I don’t think it had to do with technology limitations at all. They changed the game style to cater to more casual players
---
Duskwood never looked the way it does with the Inky Black Potion.
---
Great, now picking a class is even harder. Was almost set on mage but now I'm going back to look at druid and rogue
---
If there's any way to knock out some of the early quests do it as it's worth the XP and the money rewards, which are crucial to start off well. Your other alternative is to grind only which is going to be slower without the quest XP giving you a boost.
---
I personally tried out different races at 60 on a pserver, and I personally really like Troll Priest. Specifically because of the Blackout proc potential on Shadowguard. 
---
It's nice when a rogue tries to open up on you and gets stunned! And it's low mana, and can't get dispelled like Undead's Devouring Plague.
---
Yeah it did.
---
They said they're looking at doing a similar number to the amount they did at vanilla release which was more than 40. But it all could change. They'll be releasing more specific information about this as release gets closer though
---
Classic is a long, slow road. If you can devote the time, it’s quite the experience, but if you’re only going to play 30 mins of a game per night, I doubt you’ll be satisfied with its pacing.
---
No worries. Yeah makes sense Good luck!
---
Do you think the pet could take aggro when a lvl 30 BiS prot warrior WHILE the hunters had Blessing of Salvation(which reduces threat by 30%) coudn't ?????????????
---
LOOOOOOL
---
Not at all. You specify if you want to run;
---
DM:E
---
DM:W
---
DM:N
---
If all you advertise is DM, you're heading to deadlines son.
---
If you level up with mining, you'll get a good start on having materials. You can level with skinning also to try to have gold upon hitting 60. After you get your epic mount, just accumulate the gold and materials, then drop skinning and follow an engineering leveling guide to boost to 300 once while making the BoP items you need. Once you have the requisite gold and mats, drop engineering and do it again. This will be a massive gold dump up front, but it's the best way to be competitive in both PvP and PvE.
---
Fem orc
---
Unless you like hunches
---
This is the type of info that is useful  :)
---
lmao he was obviously being sarcastic. /woosh
---
I never even considered this but what an awesome idea!
---
What if you're in SW?
---
I miss Auberdine, it was always my home in Vanilla. Its easy to get anywhere from there.
---
Except now you're pushing 9 keys at once trying to talk.. I do want to get something like this precisely for push to talk though except I think it will be too many keypresses at once..
---
My old friends have come together and we’re all trying to pull as much of the old crew as we can to bring back our old guild. We’re not even playing it yet and we’re already more social than we were in years of retail.
---
Shaman
---
Id like one as a push to talk for discord.
---
You can get \~300-350 nature damage once Dire Maul is released, no raid gear required. Considering Rank 13 Shaman might have half of that, while AQ40 Shaman have around 400 spell power, you can do just fine without raid gear.
---
Probably a Shadow Priest with a stupid amount of gear
---
Retail doesnt feel like youre in a world, feels like a glorified lobby game nowadays for me, wow vanilla would be my choice.
---
I’m 6’3”and I can do it (because yoga) but my leg (half lotus) starts to fall asleep after 10 minutes.
---
Thanks for a big laugh
---
I play OSRS so I'm used to long goals and grinding. I can easily play like 2-3 hrs a night if I really liked it.
---
I was 21 in college in 2005 and was in a Top-5 raiding guild. I’m 35, married with two toddlers, mortgage, managing 15 engineers at work... I doubt I’ll hit 60 until next year if I give it a shot at all. 
---
Much as this will be WoW patch 1.12, it’s still 2019 when you look up from your monitor- and for most other 20-somethings in my guild back in ‘05, we’re now 30-something real adults with massive responsibilities beyond WoW. 
---
To quote Leonard Nimoy’s final tweet: **”A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory.”**
---
up to 20% when overleveled by 9 levels.
---
I’m so confused. Do we like streamers or hate them?
---
Yes.
---
I’m going to guess the sum of numbers on the right-hand side is intellect being totaled? 
---
Wholesome.
---
Fem orc warlock = based and redpilled.
---
Male UD = another drakedog wannabe clone.

This song will get stuck in my head every few weeks. This and Dennis Leary I'm an ass hole wow version..

Sky looks different and not anywhere near as dark at nights now.
---
&gt; and make sure noone dies.
---
So when I whip out my big D Deeps and kill the boss faster, I'm doing my Pally duty, right?
---
You're going to spend tens and *tens* (possibly hundreds) of *HOURS* looking at this character. Whatever looks best to you, I'd pick that one. I don't want to spend that long looking at a character I don't like looking at.
---
undead and orc are both pretty good, if you choose undead for looks that's completley fine.
---
&gt;if there was a modern/classic graphics toggle button, I'd be ok with it.  That option wouldnt actually affect the game or even be noticable to those who opt out.
---
this right here. +1
---
Was a windfury bot.
---
We exist!
---
I've also looked into this but all the review for the ones on amazon are horrible and say they just stop working after a couple months?

Can you link a proper DL link? I can't seem to find a working 1.12 client download that actually works. Thanks x
---
Everyone is starting over, new. You will be able to learn at your own pace without having to be worried about being overloaded
---
The lighting engine is different, which accounts for any differences. Otherwise, I’m sorry bud but you’re remembering it wrong, or your monitor back in 2004-2006 wasn’t very good.
---
You did see the screenshots I linked from the official World of Warcraft site, that date back to October of 2003, right? Did you also see the video I linked that was posted to youtube in 2006 that shows Duskwood at night looks virtually identical to the way it looks on BfA?
---
[We must stick together.](https://imgur.com/gallery/R1fdEt3)
---
Then you’ll probably do well in Classic. I used to have that time, as flawed as retail is, it’s more compatible for my needs today, many years later.
---
Make sure to get high latency satellite internet for a realistic experience.
---
Good for you kiddo, good for you! Like seriously, it is a great call. I totally wish I was going in blind. 
---
Anyone who hasn't played vanilla is in for a treat! Private servers were okay... They weren't vanilla even though everyone is so adamant that they were... Was close enough though and now they are changing their minds since we have classic info and real bliz data.
---
You can make a trial account for current WoW without spending any money. Play until level 20. 
---
Classic WoW will be pretty darn different, but most of the basics (how to move your character, how quests work, etc.) will be the same
---
I was have fem orc lock - looks good but u dead better suit dark caster and well... Undead male is badass
---
I like the optimism but Blizzard saying they "slowed down" is trying to let people down lightly I guess. Don't expect a beta invite. If it happens then lucky you but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
---
Well, we have another stress test coming soon to look more into it :)
---
Man. I loved classic. But to me TBC was the absolute bomb. I remember how hard Vashj and Kael we're. Requiem of souls, magtheradon, heroics..etc. still have my dreanei shaman t6. Really looking forward to classic minus getting 40 people together.
---
Nah, work backwards through the expansions.
---
I am torn between Druid and warlock. Two classes I never really played before. 
---
I mained a hunter from BC to LK and a holy paladin from LK to WoD (when I stopped playing), while also leveling warrior, priest, shaman, and mage alts to 100. And I had rogue twinks at 19 and 29. 
---
I was pretty set on an undead warlock because the fantasy of the class just seems so awesome, and they’re pretty well rounded despite being pure dps. But I worry that I will miss healing too much and have invested a bunch of time into a character that isn’t fully satisfying. 
---
I’m not gonna be a hardcore raider or PvPer, I just don’t have the time anymore. So I appreciate this post that’s more aimed at casual players. I don’t care about being at the top of meters or kill boards, I just want to help the team. So just by virtue of being in a raid or dungeon that’s doing well, and doing my part, is satisfying. And capturing a flag or getting a last second heal on my own FC to seal a WSG victory is awesome enough. 
---
Not sure what my point is here, but thanks for some more food for thought. Giving a NE Druid some more serious consideration along with the undead lock now :)
---
I probably have a notepad around full of ventrillo servers and gear I wanted.
---
double level troll
---
Times have changed since 2004. I now nork full time and have personal commitments I have to uphold at home. That said there are many hours I fuck around on youtube/twitch/reddit because I don't feel like being half invested in subpar games.
---
Don't think that'll be a problem till we reach a content drought.
---
Warriors were the majority back in vanilla.... difference is now people know they are the main tanks and are the top DPS AQ40 and beyond.    Not to mention absolute beasts in PvP.
---
Warriors are going to be way more numerous than before.
---
&gt; The illustrations to the problem are in the OP illustrated in 4 entirely different fashions.
---
Yes you've posted 4 Beta clips showing a perceived increase in range. You have yet to provide a clip from vanilla that demonstrates it's absence. Are you expecting everyone to take your word for it?
---
&gt;Course of events of your posts you've moved the objection continually:
---
The objection has remained the same the entire time. Lack of evidence for your claim. 
---
You could be using this time constructively by looking for said evidence in vanilla videos instead of wasting your time here proving nothing.
---
I was only talking about deadmines.
---
Same here man. Can’t wait for August.
---
You need like 1 actual prot tank for MC/Ony.  The others can all be DPS with offset tank gear (some fights can even use a bear). 
---
It was tough to find a raiding guild back in vanilla as a warrior unless you joined a very casual one.
---
r/Classicwow in a nutshell
---
August is not soon!!! just make some level 20's...
---
Free action potions are expensive and are not super easy to use mid combat (90% of the noob player base), I doubt this is going to be a common issue for you
---
Appreciate the offers guys! I'm gonna have a look at that video tomorrow as I don't want to trouble people with commonly asked questions, I think the words I'm not understanding and just to do with certain mobs and raid info, as I have no idea what wow is bar what I would presume is basic fetch quests at the start! :)
---
Loot councils are garbage and compel favouritism and good players to leave over decision making. Don’t do it.
---
Female undead ;)
---
Hi, /u/Tryin2dogood
---
Warrior. I've been playing my warrior main since the day I started 15ish years ago and I think the nostalgia won't hit as hard if I play something else.
---
I definitely recommend playing retail. A lot of people on this sub will tell you otherwise, but the BFA version of this game is extremely polished and refined compared to Classic. For your first WoW experience, I highly recommend retail now. Plus, you sub will count for classic 3 months from now.
---
For anyone who wants something like this, check out the "Stinky foot board". I reviewed it back when I was a writer. Totally customizable. Four pedals. It's worth a look.
---
Rat-man and the troggs. oh boy.
---
Yeah, that's what I did. Joining some casual guilds, that's perhaps why my memory says getting in a guild as tank wasn't so hard. Good to know though that it is actually harder to get into a more progress oriented guild as a tank. I'll stick with priest then 😊
---
It's actually Bellygrub in Redridge, but that's cool! Good catch on that reference!
---
This is my life at the moment... except the managing part. (I’m just the engineer) I’m treating WoW this time around as a journey to 60. Last time I flew to 60 and farmed for keys and gear. This time I’m going to read the lore, explore areas I didn’t see while flying by, and enjoying the world. And you know what? Gonna enjoy every moment.
---
Shaman is always the hardest class.
---
All other docks where shorter. Tedressil, menethil, ratchet, etc. Theramore was the only other docks that wasn't short
---
&gt; a bad shaman can still perform decently in pvp
---
That would imply a high skill floor
---
I mean, he's technically right in a purely min/max by the numbers approach; Orc racials are just better. 
---
Racials in general don't matter too much. Imo the most game changing one is Fear Ward, and even that isn't necessary.
---
Just pick whatever you think is cool. Racials don't matter that much, and in your case it matters 0% if you don't care about PvP or having an edge in wPvP.
---
Absolutely.
---
til level 30 dungeons are the same as raiding
---
Whaaat I didn't know Madseason streamed??? Hell ya.
---
Probably orc warlock if I had to place a bet.
---
Honestly i was trying to bait all the stream haters in here, but little did i know classicwow is filled with big brained individuals.
---
This is the reason why I'm reluctant to play a mage. Raiding is the pinnacle of the game for me and it seems like you'd go just crazy after a while casting the same spell over and over
---
r14 is not the goal, the goal is winning vs other top premades.
---
I am not surprised, but I am sad to see how few people want to roll a pally.  They are going to be an extremely valuable class this time around it seems.
---
Back then, so many people picked it not knowing what raiding would demand of them.  Now that people know that they are buff bots and healers, they don't want to do it.
---
The biggest thing is finding a class that fits your style.  I recommend starting as a mage/hunter cause even if you don't like them they can grind you some gold as an alt.  You are super lucky to get to be in this as a freshy, don't read too much and make good friends!  You will have sooo much time to learn while leveling.
---
i did not honestly check that far but since lv 5 was the cap i was pretty sure I saw the recipe for sagefish, only fished in Sen'jin village so i cannot say if fishing pools are present
---
Hi, /u/ZodiacTuga
---
mob fanning - its normal. the way it moves is incorrect though, where it should turn around instead of backpedaling
---
if a gnome can tank onyxia a critter can tank a mace :D
---
Loot council is only garbage if the council is garbage.  If the council is garbage, you wouldn't want to be in that guild anyway.  I've had great experiences with loot council, though never in a 40-man environment.
---
All that said, I could certainly see the format struggling with so many players and so little loot relative to something innately more objective and transparent like DKP.
---
Are grenades BoP or can you sell then on the AH?
---
If we absolutely had to have flying, they should have made it more limited. Maybe you can pay gold at certain flights masters to take control of the gryphon or whatever for a minute or two. And it would have some kind of cooldown.
---
You'd still need to travel by foot the most part or with flightpaths.
---
14.5 years ago, but yeah saying 15 years is unreasonable.
---
Hey, so far I was the one who had actual facts and evidence on their side, not you. Believe whatever you want.
---
That's what everyone says, and you're all so full of shit. You all play with DPS meters and spreadsheets and research the meta and what BiS gear to farm. You have no interest in slow-playing for discovery. Every one of you morons who claims "OMG CLASSIC BRINGS ME BACK" really just missed out on Vanilla Endgame so you have this unfinished business. That's all Classic is for you. Farming familiar shit like it's brand new again because you missed it the first time around.
---
Don't pretend it's about becoming a WaNdErInG aDvEnTuReR iN a VaSt wOrLd. That's the excuse you tell yourselves so you can absolve yourself of the blame of ruining modern WoW and pin it on someone else, like people who like flying ruined WoW or some shit.
---
Nah. Not buying it, chief.
---
Mark.my.words!
---
You can't square jump in SW.
---
Then you could argue that VC is actually even clearer as it won’t be confused for Dire Maul.
---
What "facts" exactly?
---
Wow, rude!
---
I think it’s the amount of spellpower (or spell damage whatever) each item gives
---
Wow. It looks so cool with the potion.
---
Ok, I'm rolling Warlock now.
---
8 hours a day is what I did when WoW was everything I did haha
---
I played Hunter in Vanilla. Going to roll Hunter in Classic. Been watching The Mechanic, and it's just reinforced that decision
---
What does that mean?
---
Used to solo instances for gold. Probably not gonna happen this time. Farmed Felwood for tubers and herbs. Probably not this time. Camped winterspring for lotus. Nah. Chain run UBRS for rare drops/scales. Nope.
---
Slow rested grind all the way to 60. Followed by the Occasional AV, AB, and MC/BWL clear while shooting the shit on Discord? Probably whats going to happen.
---
Both hunters were insanely good at playing their class.
---
Copying from one of my guildies:
---
"Regrowth - This build is focused on the symbiotic relationship of the improved regrowth and nature’s grace talents. You can consistently cast regrowths with the expectation of them to crit to proc nature’s grace for your next cast. Regrowth is very mana inefficient, so you must use down ranked regrowths to last the duration of the encounter and often cycle cheaper HT’s in your rotation as well.  Stacked with 5/8 T2 regrowth becomes one of the fastest heals in the game, making the Druid one of the strongest classes for keeping raid members alive, and the HoT left behind if always a good bonus for targets taking consistent damage.  Regrowth scales poorly with +healing which changing some stat values, crit% specifically gets a much higher weight while +healing drops a bit. A regrowth druid can push some of the highest HPS in the game, but it comes at the expense of extreme mana usage."

That's what everyone says, and you're all so full of shit. You all play with DPS meters and spreadsheets and research the meta and what BiS gear to farm. You have no interest in slow-playing for discovery. Every one of you morons who claims "OMG CLASSIC BRINGS ME BACK" really just missed out on Vanilla Endgame so you have this unfinished business itch you're desperate to scratch. That's all Classic is for you. Farming familiar shit like it's brand new again because you missed it the first time around.
---
It's not DDR, its SDR.
---
So by that logic, enhancement is also considered a healing specc?
---
Didn’t blizzard say they’re going to disable such addons
---
til means today I learned.
---
Ninja turtles.
---
Hi, /u/Holland45
---
One guy I know plays PC games with a steering wheel. All of them. It's his mouse.
---
these people are hilarious
---
Thanks for the info. I think another factor in the confusion over nighttime and how dark it "really" was is that in vanilla many people still played on CRT monitors, which tended to make the game look darker than on modern hardware.
---
yeah, i doubt they will add it tho cause it didnt exist back then :( i made a post on the official forums hopefully a dev will see it
---
Not quite. They said "we MAY be restricting some of those new things as well" when talking about the API functionality in relation to addons that disrupt the vanilla social experience by being able to communicate together. [Source](https://youtu.be/wS1juqaiW3o?t=2542).
---
But we're purposefully restricting ourselves to the same API calls that the big "must-have" addons use. If they break our addon, they'll be breaking just about every addon.
---
Look up wow rock papper scissors and thatll explain vanilla wow pvp
---
/train
---
This isn't a post about game mechanics, it's about community policing,  Encouraging people to not play on your server because of greifing is counter productive. It will only encourage greifers to stay on your server.
---
Are you trolling? It's arguably the highest dps class.
---
DW Fury is extremely viable and will, situation dictating, easily top meters. Just understand that you may be asked to OT from time to time.
---
1. Warrior is terrible, rogue is ok-good    
---
2. 1 Rogue, 2-3 Warriors  
---
3. Rogue is way more cd reliant  
---
4. Rogue
---
How is that relevant to what's being discussed?
---
lol i love richard
---
I didn’t start playing till end of tbc but didn’t hit level cap till cataclysm.  I only played vanilla on my cousins account when I was 6, so I am ready for it as well.
---
/u/esfandTV can't quit until you make this happen
---
I think you're taking it a bit too seriously. Soda's group was messing around and having a good time. They are just friends poking fun at each other.
---
lmao, they're going to disable your addon dude
---
I haven't played Vanilla since 2005 and even then I was only able to level a mage to max level but never had the chance to do end game content. I didn't know, that's why I asked the question here where people would likely know.
---
MC is relevant forever.  Even naxx40 guilds still run MC every week.
---
You want to break fear or resist stuns? It's really that simple man. Dont over think it.
---
Thank you very much exactly the answer I was looking for. I also enjoy tanking so being an OT won't be an issue if the situation arises.
---
Doesn't shadow have Mana issues in raids? How would you combat that?
---
Any class t3 vsing people under geared
---
Whoa.. are you me? This is my exact background. I ground through 1-70 at blinding levels to catch up with my cousins. Starting classic this week, and don't even know how to fully enjoy it! Hope you keep sharing, I'd love to hear more.
---
I see what you're saying. I guess it's short term pain for long term gain. Thanks for the input!
---
While leveling, you definitely will need to go out and tame other beasts to learn skills like claw, bite, or dash. Classic will only give you two stablemaster pet slots, so stable your main pet, go out and tame the beast you need for an upgrade, then learn it, and go back and train it to your main pet.  
---
All cats or pets in general are NOT the same. Broken Tooth the only reason that he is desirable is because he has the fast attack speed. Other cats that are not as rare will also have fast attack speeds, for example the Elder Nightsaber in Teldrassil has a 1.40 attack speed which is decent. Fast attack speed is desirable for when you get up to the BM talent that will give you Frenzy, because more attacks = more chance to proc Frenzy and on average more chances to score crits as well = a bit more DPS.  
---
You can definitely keep the same pet you have from level 10 (not 1!) to 60.
---
there's nothing hardcore about spending less than 4 minutes for a wand equavalent to one you'd have to wait for a group for to do a quest that's not along any remotely-decent route
---
but keep up the hostile tone it looks great on you
---
If you're taking it just to fill a slot and DE BoP dungeon drops, it could work. It definitely beats having no profession at all. Not sure how many items will be available to DE in a dungeon party with high need/greed rates. You can also have a bank alt pick up enchanting at level 5 for all of your BoE greens.
---
Elite pets originally had better stats, but was fixed in later patches. For Classic, they are running with 1.12 which means this will not be a thing at launch.
---
1) 1 on 1 Warrior wins 7 times out of 10 in my experience. PvP skill plays a major factor in the ratio, but generally speaking my warrior almost never lost to rogues 1 on 1 and my rogue generally beat warriors(mace spec orc, so your mileage might vary).
---
3)  Rogues.  If you have all your CDs up a good rogue is pretty close to unstoppable. However, the CDs are frequently down.  Warriors have a series of longer CDs like retaliation, shield wall, etc that are a 30 or 60 minute timer that are extremely powerful, but you're only going to get to use them once a BG and thus are not a major factor in most BGs.
---
&gt;Kind of vague but which class has more "tech" or skill ceiling/things to learn in PvP?
---
The difference between a good rogue and god like rogue is pretty large skill wise.  The difference between a good warrior and a godlike warrior is mostly gear, not skill.
---
Yea if you play osrs the wow classic grind is NOTHING
---
He is president.  Activision did not assign a CEO to blizzard and wont be doing so.
---
I exclusively do hunter. twitch is Alenya11
---
Most guilds will take one at most.
---
You’re gonna have to be a try hard and get lucky.
---
Good luck
---
You can only run 1 shadow priest in a 40man raid, unless you are already part of a guild prelaunch, it's not going to happen sorry.
---
No problem, thanks for the feedback.
---
Lmao telling me to chill out when all the vanilla fanatics in this thread are losing their god-damned minds about a feature that **really doesn't ruin the game**
---
there were always kill videos posted on warcraft videos. People like to say 'youtube didn't exist', and thats correct. However we had warcraft videos.
---
You're coming at this from the wrong perspective. 
---
Morden WoW treats each spec as almost am entirely different class.
---
I'm not saying enhancement or elemental or Balance or Prot(Paladin) were healing specs. They were different specialization trees on healing classes. It was a different mentality toward class design.
---
Its were it all started i played it as a 14yo pleb so its not as hard as people say it is just takes a lil more time
---
Go with what you like the look of. That should be your primary way to decide. If you are kinda of 50/50 go with the better racials or the racials you desire more.
---
What are the different uses for each of the professions? What’s the best for a mage? Does the best profession change as you level?
---
If you use search you will see posts that shadow priest have one raid spot per raid.
---
I am in the same boat will play shadow priest too but dosent care about raids. one day I will find a place.
---
Every raid will want at least 1 shadow priest.  5 man content you wont go oom and do reasonable damage.
---
The issue, however, is that you will have a similar issue to that of warriors.  You want to DPS as shadow, but you will find that everyone expects you to heal anyway in order to speed up the building of a group.  Warriors basically have to tank in order to get into groups.
---
Even if you form them yourself, you will feel heavily incentivized to just heal to speed it up by 20-30 min... and frankly, your team will expect it anyway.
---
His opponents are so bad dude lol
---
They do ok.  Plus it is just a shackle for strat/scholo runs, which is extremely valuable.
---
They can't just name an addon and it no longer works.
---
AVR-E was deemed too powerful, so they limited the API to make sure no addons could have the same features. The addon used some very obscure combination of features, we're just using the chat protocol.
---
Babelfish allows for cross-faction communication. It was so simple, Blizzard couldn't do anything about it, so they made it a violation of the ToS. It still works today and requires a player report for anything to happen.
---
Like everyone said, there will be 1 slot for shadow priests in a raid that will be competitive to get, require good gear and probably be low in gear rotation. Also, that slot doesn't open until bwl launches and the dot slots increase to 16. Your pretty well boned for mc
---
None of you people can link things like flying to loss of subscriptions. That's pure conjecture, and given the scale of the backlash when they tried to remove it I'm going to go ahead and assume that quite a lot of people actually prefer it to stay in the game. Literally 100% of the reservations you people have with flying are baseless conjecture and handwaving sprinkled with buzzwords like "immersion" and "interaction".
---
HINT: Vanilla had flying too, it was just on rails. If you remove flying mounts, people will just use flight paths to get everywhere and the "lack of interaction" will be **no different**. Think before you speak.
---
Nope you're not being paranoid, even guilds that see value in the spec only want to bring one, and they're in the minority.
---
The more meta question is if you want to play a cloth caster that deal shadow damage and has dots and you don't really care about the healing aspects, why not play Warlock?
---
As a shift worker who basicly sleep during night shifts, I am lucky enough to have plenty of time home not having to worry about anything. I will take time off during the first week then I will play here in there nolifing my way to 60. I won't be in a hurry to get there tho. I want to immerse myself in the lore. Gonna soon read some warcraft books.
---
The hype is real
---
But this is so obvious a troll by asmon it doesn’t exactly require a big brain😂
---
Sounds like someone trying to save face
---
Holy hell lmfao. Leave your basement and get some sunlight bro its gonna be ok i promise. 
---
So yeah just disregard the last 15 years if tech advancements and go back to stoneage to play true classic. This is one of the craziest gatekeeping posts i have ever read lol
---
Your dps sucks.
---
Your mana sucks.
---
Your healing and mana efficiency is worse.
---
No one will take you, neither pvp or pve.
---
It's more common to have the worst geared priest spec into something like 0 33 18 so he uses rank 1 mindblast to keep shadow weaving up whilst still having good healing for wherever needed (just worse mana and gets more aggro but he is not healing as much). Basically your entire raid contribution but better.
---
You reckon? He versus rank 14s who seem to know what they’re doing.
---
Every time someone says 'stance dance' I hear it to the tune of 'Dance Dance' by Fallout Boy. I am cursed.
---
Pretty foolish if you think modern blizzard is powerless against addons, this isn't 2005 blizzard who made games with a tin can and a piece of cheese
---
One use for it is to use in stealth before opening, then waiting for your energy to tick back.  It will only have a second or two left on the buff, but it will buff your opening ravage and gets ravage's 350% modifier.
---
To tell the truth I *have* played a little bit of Alliance since, but only ever as alts. The highest was a 40-ish NElf Rogue doing the Ironman Challenge (cannot wait to get back into that with the full difficulty!), whom I leveled through the NElf starting zones because THEY'RE SO GOOD &lt;3
---
I've also played a little bit of the Human starting areas...but I've never played through Redridge for example, or even really *been* to Dun ~~Morugh~~ ~~Morough~~ ~~Murr~~ uhh...the Dwarven/Gnome areas, apart from Warlock &amp; Shaman quests and of course the dreaded NElf Wetlands death run.
---
At any rate I know I've experienced essentially nothing Alliance-side post-40ish, and only slightly more than nothing from 20-40. Meanwhile, I've leveled so many Horde characters I could probably find Mankrik's wife blindfolded. I'm just not sure I could play without Tauren, or the Undercity!
---
Yes you’re correct.
---
See other post. You're just flat out wrong. If you can't refrain from posting bad arguments my way please keep it to one reply. 
---
Flying is already restricted to max level so the questing argument is dead. Flying is already restricted in max level zones in prior expansions like Argus and Timeless Isle so that's always on the table for end-game content. And now we have flying restricted until several months into the expansion after all the content is thoroughly cleared by everyone. So literally none of the "issues" you bring up matter. This is just another case of vanilla purists trying to control how others enjoy the game and trying to hijack actual issues with their scapegoats.
---
Hunter.
---
I played Vanilla and I specifically remember waiting at the WSG portal in Ashenvale and I saw some guy with a huge ass tiger, which was way bigger than any tiger I had ever tamed.
---
I did.
---
You're tied to your death graveyard.
---
- I tried logging.
---
- I tried switching continents
---
- I tried logging after switching continents
---
- I tried switching continents twice.
---
- I tried logging, switching continents, logging, switching continents, then logging again.
---
You can't cheat the graveyard.
---
Fury War is the strongest dps throughout vanilla.
---
Outside of shadow weaving, ask why would a guild ever want a shadow priest debuff taking up one of the already few available debuff slots. I would rather those slots at the very least go to warlocks. 
---
Will raiding guilds exist that let you? Probably, yes. Will they get very far in clearing consistently? Time will tell but a betting man would say no.
---
No they were tilted for sure
---
I loved the TBC raiding experience but I thought that the addition of flying mounts took away from some of the excitement and immersion in the world. Questing became more about only accomplishing the objective rather than experiencing the world as you traveled through it.
---
didn’t read lol
---
the only reason this worked is because hunters ignore glancing blows, parries, and dodges. still cool tho
---
yeah the slower the weapon the higher the top end damage is for example 
---
1.7s dmg 50-70 
---
3.5s dmg 70-110
---
numbers are from my ass but the point is the slower wep has higher top end damage meaning higher heroic strike hits/mortal strike/whirlwind and so on. its not just because the wep is slow that its better but because it has higher top end damage which is almost always the case for slower weapons
---
Please do yourself the favor and give it a shot.
---
I was to young when vanilla came out to really get into it but a few years ago haf my first run on private servers.... was the first time since my young childhood that i was genuinley and totally hooked on a game again. Thinking about it through the day, talking about it etc etc. There was a reason it climed to millions of subs in the early expansions
---
Yes, it also did notoriously low damage. You might as well use the armor destroy in pvp on warriors rather than rupture.
---
Classic is obviosuly undertuned, sad to see a great game being so easy now
---
The API is agnostic to whatever addon is using it. If the API allows for LFG functionality, then a LFG addon will always work. Our LFG addon only needs chat functionality, which most addons need. If they change the API to break us, they'll break everything.
---
I prefer the SP gameplay and kinda want to play something under represented.
---
They even kept saying “slow and steady wins the race” throughout haha
---
Rogue with CDs is stupidly strong 1v1. Warrior is arguably the weakest 1v1 class. 
---
0-1 rogues just to guard flags. 2-3 warriors. 
---
Rogue is very CD dependent, they’re useless without them. Warrior is not CD dependent at all.
---
I’d say rogue has a higher skill ceiling and tricks but Warrior is not easy by any means.
---
Classic is obviously undertuned, sad to see a great game being so easy now
---
Pretty sure it does. In vanilla its +5% overall health. So with for a 5k hp tank that's 250hp. The equivalent of an extra 25 stam isn't game breaking, but it's not nothing.
---
Thanks for taking the time todo that! 
---
I was wondering would you think that would be the most effective xp/time as far as grinding mobs go?
---
iirc orange mobs gave even more xp than yellow and green ones right? Did xp only drop off for quests. 
---
And how long do you think you could keep up that strategy if you wanted to level as. Group?
---
I'll say it again, you're a fool if you really think blizz is powerless to stop an addon that harms the classic part of classic wow
---
Thanks, maybe classic won't be for me.
---
Playing warrior so long, zoomed in on berserker stance. I always thought the icon was a raptor of some sort, jeeze
---
I was 15 when I played, and most people I ran into were adults.  Age had little to nothing to do with it.  I was a better gamer at 15-18 than I ever was after I started working.
---
Look, I actually agree it's hard to kite as a tauren shaman, hit box and all.
---
&gt; if you want to play with us at the top level
---
Lost it here, just can't take you seriously.
---
LFG was added before the Dark Portal opened. It is part of the Classic experience.
---
And we're not fools, we're challenging Blizzard. We know their API and we know their history with addons they don't like. Bring it on.
---
I am so glad twinking will be back to its true form.
---
Undertuned
---
One of the hardest part of low level dungeons is having people with appropriate gear to do them. These guys are BIS so it helps a lot.
---
I will look into trying to find a nice pre guild I guess.
---
Like a lot of people on this thread, I need some help deciding which class to play. I know that I'm going Alliance on a PvP server, and I know that I know that my mates will be playing as a Warrior and a Priest. We'll also likely focus on a lot of BG &amp; WPvP.
---
I'm currently torn between a Mage or Druid. I love the idea of farming as a Mage and their utility spells are incredible. Not to mention the ability to create food and ports when needed will be very convenient. On the other hand, I've mained a Feral Druid since WoD and love the versatility and mobility of the class - a great combination for PvP. What turns me off Mage is the popularity of the class, what turns me off Druid is that I'd prefer not to heal when raiding/instancing. 
---
**Help.**
---
I think you’re forgetting the part where you need linen
---
The reason why engineering would be very expensive for him is because he pairs it with blacksmithing. As a pair that's about as expensive as it gets in terms of prof pairs. Gonna have to buy ***ALL*** the mining mats from the AH. It's so much easier to just take one of those and then take mining as the second profession since the mats from it feed right into blacksmithing/engineering.
---
SP will be beyond over represented for how useful and viable it is at end game.
---
I'm still 100% sure i wont have beta, but there is no drop down box above play. Any ideas why?
---
What will you be doing for gearing?
---
just because something is viewer friendly doesn't mean it's e-sport material; it's one piece of the puzzle
---
lots of people get lost in the UI of dota 2, but that is one of THE e-sport games
---
I can hardly remember what I did. I know I would play around with deadly, rupture and all that when trying to kite warriors . But it was never a serious part of my rotation. I agree expose armor is the tits
---
Which dungeons are worth doing while leveling ? And what level should I do them ?
---
:(
---
If you raid 2 days a week for 3 hours each of those days, then you can easily clear MC/ony in a couple months (at least the guild I joined in post 1.12 did).  
---
BWL starts to get rough though.  2 days with 3 hours each day isn't enough time to clear MC/ony every week on top of push through BWL.  It is extremely slow.  
---
If you want to clear BWL, I would join a 3 day guild.  If you want to do AQ40/naxx40, then you likely still need to raid 5 days a week.
---
Amazing
---
I’m in agreement with everyone else, I’d buy this.
---
As a raid SPriest: Solo farming fucktons of Demonic Runes, and chugging them and Mana Potions like water, and then running out of mana anyway and spamming rank 1 Mind Flay to keep up SW. Hopefully with enough raid damage, you won't run out on most fights until the very end.
---
I healed MC and ZG as shadow, let alone dungeons.
---
Well he says always pair it with blacksmithing soooo...
---
I was 13 back in '04 and never got to experience the end game content since I was too shy to get on ventrillo with ym squeaky voice. I quit and laid my Tauren Shaman to rest thinking he'd never see the light of day again. You're damn right he has unfinished business.
---
What makes a Hunter good? 
---
I was thinking of playing one but I always thought they were one of the more simple classes to play
---
To be fair, they're SUPER geared for their level, normal level 30's probably wouldn't be able to do this
---
I really want to play what I have fun with, I hope I can find a more laid back guild who are able to clear stuff in good time.
---
The 16-debuff change happened in ZG, not BWL. That being said, the devs have already stated several times that they intend to launch Classic with the 16 limit from the outset, so that's not an issue.
---
Since you were the first to comment I’ll direct this question at you. I’ve been reading up on everything WoW related for the past five hours.
---
Is there a general plan for what happens once the vanilla content runs dry? When people are done with the high end raiding? When folks have leveled their mains and alts to 60? 
---
Will they re release TBC, but with modifications that keep it as “vanilla-y” as possible? Will they simple copy what they’ve done in the past? Or is classic destined to be a 1.5 year thing and then the dream ends?
---
What other class/spec do you think will be under represented but more requested than SP?
---
It’s exactly as it was in vanilla. People are better at the game and they are pretty much all thinks.
---
Someone help me choose a class, I'm absolutely stumped. Alliance.
---
Easier to an individual, yes. 
---
Much harder and far more time consuming to put together for raid leaders.  
---
Keep in mind that the time for a run to get started is also much longer; buffing takes longer, resting between pulls takes longer, recovering from a wipe is tedious and much longer, and the overall movement of the group is more sluggish as a whole.  
---
It isn't an issue of skill, so much as it is an issue of raw time and gear.  Pushing through content in a 2 day raiding guild that raids 3 hours a day is still going to take the guild a long time to clear rag/ony, and may take a massive amount of time to slowly push BWL (on top of clearing the others every week).
---
FOR PONY!
---
I have been testing out some leveling strats and my Lord is it harder than I remember. I am no slouch when it comes to WoW but I still struggle
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=fsteak&amp;amp=true
---
it is, you are correct. They typically healed the melee group since their melee totems were better than the ones the resto shammies had which were more oriented towards supporting a caster group. 
---
Since you main raid heal is chain-heal, very few talents you have actually affect it's efficiency in resto, which is mostly built around Healing Wave which is simply inferior to what a priest or druid can do for tank healing, even with 3/3 Healing way.
---
So your typically Enhance shammy will melee and keep totems down while throwing out chain heals whenever his group is taking damage.
---
mage is like druid's most favorable matchup at low levels lol.
---
I read the battle chicken tooltip and I didn't really understand why this would be the case. However after reading a comment on wowhead it made more sense. In case others like myself are wondering:
---
&gt;Fights like other engineering pets; permanently on agressive. The chicken does a single point of damage and has a 2.0 attack speed until it rages. It's level is equal to your engineering skill/5 (Yes, gnomes have level 63 chickens). Very little health. 30 minute cooldown.  
---
**Abilities:**  
---
*Chicken Rage*: 100% AP and 100% haste (the chicken will do around 70 damage to level 60 mobs, at a speed of 1.0) Lasts 10 seconds.   
---
*Battle Squawk*: 5% haste to party members near the chicken. Lasts 5 minutes. The chicken will rage at least once if it fights its entire duration.  
---
Getting it to Battle Squawk is pretty rare, averages one squawk every 3 or 4 times it's out.
---
You can start at 20 for new characters?
---
Depends on the time spent.  
---
If you are talking 2 days a week, 3~ hours a day, then that guild cannot clear AQ40, and might even have a hard time pushing through BWL when they still have to clear MC/ony every single week.
---
You’re amazing. Thanks for writing all of this for us.
---
Good point about the trailer, thank you, I haven't thought about it. 
---
But it can't be taken as a reference talking about things in the classic wow. Because you know, everything went a little bit weird in the game with the path of time. The text on the skill still says "conceal in shadow" which is not invisibility and I can't see how it's a "canon". There might be other references from the early stages of the game I do not know about? 
---
But saying it is "canon" with the only argument being the newest trailer? Oh please. 
---
Nevertheless, if they showed rogues running stealthed in the trailer, they would do it the way animation works in BfA. Because it's a BfA trailer.
---

---
*damage. The hunters did all the damage but they wouldn’t have been able without Esfand’s insane utility and the healer.
---
There's nothing arguable about it. It is, bar none, the best DPS in the game in any encounter that isn't poison to melee specs.
---
dungeons are only worthwhile time-wise if you have all the quests.
---
but fun-wise, just do whatever.
---
Lol. Okay, that sounds equally terrifying. Rather be chased by a night elf than a creepy goblin.
---
Jesus, the atmosphere was so palpably and unbelievably *thick* when I first played WoW when it released. It was so haunting and the experience has stuck with me all these years even after quitting.
---
Orc hunter for that stun resist in pvp. Secure your spot in a raid by being the primary NF proccer (Hunter statistically has the highest uptime for NF).
---
It’s exactly as it was. Quit being a crybaby.
---
While you are reaching the correct conclusion, it's not based on the right reasons. Originally, rupture didnt scale with AP (not until 1.7 or 1.8 or something like that) while eviscerate did and eviscerate can crit (again, DoT crits weren't a thing until BC and even then only for Affliction warlocks who specced into it) making it scale even better.
---
Feral cats who try to DPS basically do the same thing, but without SnD they have to rely on MCPs for the requisite haste for their white DPS.
---
They can't do impossible things with it, for technology they still need to start with  actually functioning tech, but it can be really shoddy tech as ork tech usually is. If enough of them believe it works without exploding, it probably will.
---
Another effect is if a group think a particular ork is a big badass, he will put on muscle and become a big badass. It's why all the leaders are huge.
---
Think of it as a layer of enhancement onto everything they do, to make a gang of savages become competitive versus the other races.
---
Have you looked at warlock?
---
You can get to level 20 for free.
---
1. Warrior is the worst duelist in the game. Rogue is one of the best. Though if you are pvp specced you win duels versus most if not all pve players. so it only matters versus other skilled pvpers
---
2. 1 rogue and 1-3 warriors.
---
3. Rogue are way more cd reliant
---
4. Definitely rogue.
---
Well shit, I got druid. Fuck that lol
---
Alliance is widely known as the elitist faction.
---
Why not just buy an mmo mouse
---
Myself and brother in law, playing retail but prefer vanilla
---
Why is this so funny
---
lol at all these butt hurt commenters that are mad that they didn’t get invited to the beta. Go back to sodapoppin’s stream.
---
Yeah, I feel like I'm mis-remembering TBC or something, because there was still lots of WPVP back then. only pvp area that was rarely super active was the one in Hellfire Peninsula.  The areas in Nagrand and Terrokar were always great when the pvp event was up.
---
Even Winterspring in WotLK was active during its up time, but that was around the time I'd argue wpvp really started to die.
---
im a big fan of leveling as fury until pvp becomes a big issue (usually mid 30s in contested zones) thats when I usually swap to arms and get tactical mastery.
---
is this legit, where can you get one of these?
---
Aggro and mana management were the challenges in vanilla.
---
Where can I find
---
don't I don't care much, just be prepared for the inevitable truth of "should have went orc" which essentially makes it so you reroll char or never be invited.
---
It authenticates the time period 😁
---
I didn’t see many DK’s until wrath came out then I saw a whole bunch, so it happens.
---
That would be against subreddit rules. Keep an eye on your DMs
---
you get linen naturally by levelling to 10. at least in the UD area, it's about 60 cloth from doing the quests.
---
Yeah I get that too.. I suppose Im just more concerned with being able to play/ tank dungeons and quest effectively while questing on my own. Im not as concerned with the time its going to take me to hit 60.
---
Excellent find and certainly something that isn't working quite right.  I hope you submitted a bug report for that.
---
Apologies if you showed yourself submitting a bug in the video, I skipped over some parts.
---
Accurate or not, the state of 1.12 and Classic is  .......   lol.
---
I totally feel the same. Much more social since the beta has released. I think that "I was wrong about classic wow" youtube video really changed my mind. Lots of his points on why it's fun really clicked with me.
---
That is a name that I haven't heard for a long time.   
---
\*strokes beard\*
---
Vanilla is an mmo.
---
Retail is a single player action game.
---
Feel free to ask some super basic questions if you have any after you watch that video and I’ll do my best to answer them for you.
---
Are you trolling me back? I actually recorded a clip of me saying "I know this is him being sarcastic, i was just trying to bait classicwow monkeys into talking smack" just in case
---
Okay cool. Def will consider that. Do you ever tank as fury? Thats something Im really wanting to do too.
---
Did they have the quest for SM before thing so they can get the quest gear?
---
I'm not serious.
---
People are better than they were in classic, and you need to remember they are rocking BiS lvl 30 gear, that's why its possible to clear these dungeons
---
Timing, rotations and good movement when kiting.
---
dont be turned off a class because of its popularity. lets just say theres a reason why you only bring 2-3 druids to a raid whilst you bring 8 mages. on top of that an ideal 5 man composition has a mage due to polymorph and water.
---
feral is doable but only casually, you will also have to farm many crowd pumellers from gnomer as well as all the other consumables to even dream of competing with the likes of other pure dps classes. but thats fine, as long as youre happy with being the best of your niche.
---
Time commitment eh?
---
That orphanage attacked me first!
---
I don't think you know them very well if that's what you think. I watched the whole thing and they clearly gave no fucks.
---
In flames
---
Why do you think classic is undertuned?
---
Just curious, what makes you think I wasn't trying to bait the subreddit, since you are clearly an omega 5Head
---
The last couple of nights have been the first time I've had dreams about WoW since TBC haha.  I'm so excited for classic!!
---
I also thoroughly enjoyed TBC. However, I do feel like flying mounts were the start of the game's downfall. You really stopped running into people as much.
---
Typical ele shaman takes 21 points in resto.  All they really miss out on is 10% base heal power and mana tide totem.
---
the rogue CDs and stealth combine to make leveling a lot less dangerous as a rogue.  If you make zero mistakes a warrior will go slightly faster but for cases where you pull too many, aggro a patrol, catch a respawn, get ganked, ect.. rogues can pull from their bag of tricks to stay alive.
---
engineer is always best for every class. tailoring is also min/max depending on the phase for mage because of bloodvine set and robe of the archmage.
---
Esfand was protection spec for that run, Asmon had Blessing of Salvation on him.
---
&gt;Classic is obviously undertuned, sad to see a great game being so easy now
---
Hunter is the only class able to deal damage to higher level mob because of few misses and no glancing blow/resist compared to other class. They are basically all twink at that point, if they can tank the mob, hunters will kill them eventually. Nothing special here.
---
It's a meme that warriors are hard. I had one in vanilla before the meme existed and wouldn't call them (or rogues) hard to level, they're just not as simple as a mage, hunter, etc.
---
Yeah I've really enjoyed his streams too.
---
1.12 is so brain dead lol.
---
They took an already easy game and made it .... like this.
---
If this keeps up, they'll be doing scholo/strath/ubrs at 50.
---
Yeah I have tanked alot of private servers as fury. U wont be able to charge in and get that extra rage via charge, so you really need to manage your rage a bit more.        
---
What I mean is if dont overthreat a mob, if it has 2 sunders and hit by a revenge at 30% hp just auto and save rage to the next pull. And if there is some downtime inbetween each pull use bloodrage to keep yourself in combat and keeping your rage up.
---
Well, it seems like they're going to drag out the classic content for 1.5-2 years. So they've got plenty of time to plan for it. There's been some TBC talk, but no one really knows for sure. At this point we're pretty much all fingers crossed that classic doesn't get ruined. So far they seem to be doing it right.
---
I wouldn't even agree with that assessment. Vanilla was, and still will be, very casual friendly.
---
They changed the game to cater to *instant gratification* individuals, which are a very particular subset of casuals. Instead of aiming for long term subs, they resorted to loot box explosions and fancy flashing lights to try to nab a segment of the *Candy Crush* crew.
---
A casual can make it very far in Vanilla. It simply takes a lot longer, but leveling itself might as well be part of the game.
---
I plan on skipping death to save time traveling back to my corpse.
---
right, though the question is if classic elite mobs (not just bosses) are doing the same dps (not damage) as 1.12 mobs did.
---
then eliminate them from the wheel and spin again. continue until you get it down to a 50/50 and then if you get one but regret it you found your class.
---
&gt; what turns me off Druid is that I'd prefer not to heal when raiding/instancing.
---
Yeah you're gonna be healing :) At least unless Blizzard tweak some numbers for the sake of class balance, pardon the pun. With identical numbers I wouldn't expect the meta to change unfortunately.
---
I'm positive with Classic being perpetual that BWL and AQ40, and even some of Naxx, will be pugged in time.
---
I'm sure most people will know about deathwarp or deathskipping to save travel time in earlier levels - but you can also use it later on when you're doing a lot of travel without any real negative issues.
---
If you're a hunter, you will also have the benefit that your pet DPS is not affected by Rez Sickness.
---
Not sure if this is the case for warlock pets but worth checking out.
---
Blizz has a reference client so doubtful it’s off mate
---
He should just use his gun, no parry no dodge no miss no glancing blow, only 27% miss.
---
That may be hard but probably possible. Perhaps consider doing shadow in outdoor pve content and pvp while volunteering to be your guild’s shadow weaving heal priest?
---
Both my parents played WoW so I was fortunate to become a mega nerd playing WoW at 8 lol. I honestly can't wait to see how much has "changed" in my mind. The only raid I cleared was ZG so I'm stoked for another shot at the rest of the content.
---
I did the same , i fell very lost too. My end goal with retail is a wow token for classic ...
---
AFAIK it goes hunter-&gt;warlock-&gt;priest. and priest is a 7, druid a 9? wat?
---
I remember seeing it for the first time and thinking "wtf there are holes over here, how are we supposed to stop the alliance?? We are so fucked, how could they fuck this up" I was concerned.
---
Gotta plan your route accordingly, most won't be able to really make super use of this but it's nice to know
---
I understand, but I was more looking for something a little more logic based. I'm way too indecisive for the wheel bc no matter what I get I'll regret it and think the other is better. thanks tho :)
---
Maybe with the chicks you talk to.
---
With mine, the pedals are going to short out because of the 4 inch puddle on the floor of my room.
---
Are you a bot?  lol
---
I am 100.0% sure that zaiman is not a bot.

All in fun and jealousy of being able to sit cross-legged in a chair =P
---
Yeah you can definitely drop combat with dots on you. Could just be an ol’ stuck in combat bug which still can happen on retail.
---
You warriors are stance punks.

Weren't there AV weekends where people could get the required rep in like a couple days?

Lana...!
---
If you have any evidence at all of this then you need to make a post on reddit and we'll back you up, whining does nothing.
---
That would explain how his 14 year old footage gets him more viewers than his live gameplay.
---
You will find a guild that you can raid with.  There will be hundreds of guilds that know the difference between viable and optimal. SP raided in vanilla, it won't be different now.
---
1.5 - 2 years is perfect. Enough time so that people can really enjoy the product, rather than what we currently have, which is folks rushing to the level cap, grinding dailies to stay afloat, and raiding the new content immediately.
---
If you get some good gear though, it can be a nice power bump though... just not guaranteed...

WeirdChamp FeelsWeirdMan NORMIES Omegalul

What happened was (at least in wrath) you would send mail, if you didnt touch it for 30 days it would then be sent back and then if you didnt touch it again for 30 days it would delete.
---
This changes everything! 😲
---
Man, I forgot about this, but as soon as I saw the preview still, I knew EXACTLY what it was.
---
Was it necessary to copy and paste your comment 8 times around this thread?
---
Let’s be honest...soda and asmon are both whiners.  Esfand is the only one i can watch without rolling my eyes
---
Gonna love it when casters go OOM in 30 seconds in to a fight
---
The ability to multitask under pressure while controlling their pets effectively.
---
Anybody can stand there and plonk away with a bow with their pet set on defensive, a good hunter needs to react quickly and CC or kite mobs in various ways. (figure 8 terrain pathing, frost trap, wing clip jousting, dot and stutter step shots, line of sight)
---
Exactly. 
---
Also, the daily quests started with TBC. I absolutely hate the concept of dailies.
---
Not sure if there were any in classic but if there were, they were sporadic.
---
Some people aren't messing around. Yes, these are foot pedals that they have photoshopped Warcraft icons onto.
---
Maybe find a way to try and generate gold on retail? You should be able to pay with retail gold and play classic.
---
Don't worry. Even with the best pre-raid gear and talent specs, there will be plenty of bad players.
---
Even today on private servers, there are guilds full of bad players wiping in Molten Core.
---
I was in a 15 man all hunter group for strat way back in the early days.
---
Need to find those ss's!
---
truth
---
They certainly are larger at low level.
---
Oh man, I used to do 14+ on the regular
---
Rupture was buffed to scale with AP in 1.12. It's good now.
---
1000 attack power, 30% crit, 3/3 Imp Evis, 5 combo points, ~5000 armor boss:
---
Eviserate modifier = AP * (CP * 0.03) = 150 in our example
---
Eviserate base dmg = (904 + 150) up to (1012 + 150) = 1054 to 1162
---
Eviserate crit dmg = 2108 up to 2324
---
With crit chance and talents, the average Evis dmg is 1728
---
After armor reduction, the average Evis hits for 934.
---
Rupture = AP * 0.24 + 800 = 1040 dmg and ignores armor.
---
It's a good plan
---
I forgot to put the /s in there! ;)
---
not to be funny here, but original wow was like that.
---
hour long que's...not saying I want to see that ever again..
---
If you are willing to put that much effort in, then ya I guess it should be fine to raid as spriest
---
I was so stuck on Mage that I've been playing on private servers.. in original vanilla I played warrior, had a 60 on both horde and alliance. And that warrior itch is coming back.. 
---
Still I'm torn between mage, warrior, priest and hunter.. it could really go either way :x
---
The game was never THAT hard. You were probably just young and bad. No offense.
---
He is a troll. Posting this exact pasta on multiple threads on multiple posts. Downvote and move on.
---
Since we're playing 1.12, after you reach a certain Attack Power, Rupture outclasses Eviscerate on high-armor targets.
---
You definitely could drop combat even with dots on you. The application of the dot is what would put you in combat, and the timer would begin from that.
---
Same mob respawned for the other group. Makes me wonder if it's just coded in by Blizzard.
---
If you want to talk to people in general chat, you should go to the current capital cities (Boralus/Dazar'alor or at least Stormwind/Orgrimmar). Literally no one goes to Ironforge because there is simply no reason to be there anymore.
---
Here's my actual, honest advice. You are most likely someone who simply won't ever like retail so you should find a way to make some gold and buy WoW tokens with the gold. That way, you can stay subbed and be opted into getting the beta OR you can pay for your WoW Classic sub with the WoW tokens.
---
Gawd dayum
---
Right, I had similar experiences, being 15 at launch, but most the information about min/maxing wasn't widely disseminated.  I can recall using the elitist jerks forums for proper speccing and gearing, but the vast majority of players were in the dark about that kind of stuff.
---
I was 27, was in early beta and pre-purchased the CE. been playing in one form or another since then.
---
And Archaedas spawns a ton of mobs during the fight. Including elites. There is absolutely no chance they could do it at 30 without exploiting it somehow.
---
Im the same age man.  
---
I played Vanilla when I was 9 and god was I terrible!
---
The kobold mine in Elwynn are particularly brutal even if you group
---
or just let people fight while on flying mounts, but with reduced effectiveness (mobs already evade if they can't hit you, so you can't really exploit it, either they can fight back or you reset them, and having to do that with increased cast times, reduced attack speed, and much higher miss chances would make it a lot less preferable (and you still have to be completely still to use channelled/cast-time abilities as they're too delicate to maintain while a mount is moving more than hovering)). It's something you'd prefer to avoid, but if someone was trying to avoid you, you could go and get them.
---
Not everyone can throw a 1-hit kill dot on you and then slow fall/parachute to safety. (or remount in mid air after about 10 seconds of falling in the case of a Druid).
---
I really wish they gotten to make that film.
---
While leveling almost any spec should be able to tank.
---
Only paladins have seals
---
Yeah that's what I remembered! I only saw like one other guy say so. I added the link of the duel of it if you care to see lol.
---
He had bloodrage on. Same mistake as he made earlier in the stream.
---
It did drop off though. Im on mobile so there is probably something else I missed too.
---
My gf of 4 years had just dumped me when wow first came out. I went hard to avoid feeling anything, lol
---
It would help if you had friends to play with. But if you don’t it’s ok too you will get the opportunity to talk to and meet a lot of new people. Just don’t be afraid to talk to others.
---
Using your 1-19 guide. Really good so far and being able to compare/watch your stream is awesome.
---
Regular priest.
---
He's 11, not 60 tho :p
---
Hmm yes, a hand picked party of specialized twinks with double the health of a fresh 30 means that Classic is undertuned. Yep, definitely.
---
This was fantastic!
---
Limit the speed back to 60%.  Plenty of people struggled to unlock epic flying in TBC which would go towards the reason not everyone started hating it yet.  There were still plenty of instances where getting on your 100% ground mount was preferable.
---
Oh I'm firmly no changes, but I still want to get my grievances known just in case they DO make changes anyway.
---
the only change I'd personally like is attunements never being removed, but I'd be willing to compromise on it being made into a once-per-account thing, rather than need it on every character thing. 
---
That was the primary complaint that it was a big headache to get alts ready for a raiding B/C/D team.
---
Some hardcore M'ladying in there with a dash of Redpill non-sense.
---
...that said I was in 2 different guilds in Vanilla where a female raid member literally traveled to the raid leaders house and slept with them. Nerd Love? Coincidence? Maybe.  But good luck telling the other DPS wars that.
---
Will you seriously stop with this spam garbage in every comment. Go back to BFA pleb.
---
Touché!
---
Ahh that explains the real reason why he didn't drop combat then. I definitely don't know warriors enough to catch that so easily, but I knew rogues, and knew I could restealth between dot ticks. 
---
I do remember sometimes it would happen though, that you'd just for some reason not leave combat. We just called it "combat bug" though.
---
Undertuned for casuals. Classic is rip.
---
It's like a Jerry Springer show. You're not even sure it's real, but you're not changing the channel are you?
---
Blizzard announced they were done giving out Beta invites to all but Friends and Family about 4 days ago. You just wasted $15.
---
Fuck.
---
They are grossly over geared. They've spent 2 weeks farming BiS for a dungeon that is aimed at people in leveling gear and specs.
---
PVP starts 2 minutes in
---
cool bit of PVP to watch actually!
---
Yeah good points lol.....
---
The main challenge is the fact that they tend to rely on body pulling more which can be tough.  No escape, no ranged interrupt, etc. 
---
But I agree.  
---
I just don't see 60% of people abandoning their warr while leveling like some are predicting.
---
Wherever is comfortable for your fingers. Some folks get mine with a lot of buttons, some get gaming keypads like the Tartarus V2, some use a standard KB/m combo.
---
You may not bind the "backwards" key and only use ASD to move to keep surrounding keys to abilities, modifiers like control, alt and shift, etc.
---
I don't personally bind non-combat abilities like soulstone, mount, food, etc.
---
I dont know of any guides, but really just bind keys that easy for you to touch some generic good ones would be Q,E,R,F,G. if your mouse has any side buttons those,  mouse wheel click in, up, and down.  Also adding shift or control to any of those or even just your 1-6 is a whole bunch of new keybinds.  
---
also another piece of advice try to keep things similar between characters.  If you have an interrupt try to keep it on the same key to help your muscle memory
---
Pretty sure these are sequishas
---
Excellent, update is going out this week too with beta fixes
---
If you have the maps would like to know how they are working for you, DM me if that's ok
---
It gets more and more sad Everytime you post this comment in this thread
---
Nothing definitive. It's generally what feels best for you. The only really common one is to make your keyboard turns into strafes, then rebind the former strafes (Q, E) into binds. Also, alt, shift, and Ctrl can be modifiers. R, t, f, g, z, x, c, v are all easily accessible.
---
Some people rebind wasd to esdf. I can't get used to it, but if you can, it opens up more keybinds to the left.
---
Keybinds or macros? Keybinds are very personal and while people might try to make guides, it's just something you gotta figure out. I one for one use 
---
12345QERTFVC (then shift modify all those, then Ctrl modify 12345)
---
No they do not.
---
Please send cards and flowers to Tipsout in the hospital burn unit.
---
Classic
---
Just be aware, warriors in general, but dual wield fury more so... are incredibly gear dependent. While you're leveling, you won't have the +hit, and early at 60 you won't have the crit or attack power to top any meters. The further you go, the better it gets. By AQ40/Naxx they are one of the best dps available.
---
RUNNING RAMPANT THROUGH THE HALLOWED CORE!
---
If you have only played the recent expansions then Classic will be a real wild ride for you because there is a lot less button mashing and a lot more planning ahead of time what skills you are going to use and hope they don't miss. It is a little more laid back for some classes. Some just auto attack some just have one spell the cast others have a full spell book of things to use based on the situation (look at shamans action bars)
---
Jokes on you, you still get to play 1-110 retail wow with the sub.
---
I hated people were talking shit about Esfand (at least on Asmongold's chat). The dude clearly knows what he's doing and has a lot of vanilla experience.
---
As a dps warrior I had a windfury bot and a shadowpriest in my group during raids. Good times !
---
Where does this shield even come from?
---
Figured you'd like the intro as much as I did!
---
you gotta give more info then. do u wanna heal/dps/tank, do u prefer ranged dps/melee dps. do u want to be competitive or casual. pve or pvp. etc.
---
That'd be awesome, but really I can probably only play a couple of nights a week so it'll be awhile before I get there anyway. I'll be happy to be back into MC and ZG (maybe AQ20 as well!).
---
Absolutely, I wish i could be you. Whatever you do give it time. Some classes are horrid at early levels but every level you get stronger and stronger. It's what drives the game. I really can't wait.
---
PvP Shadow Priests aren’t bad tho....
---
That thing that isn't addressed in the post is that while yes, fury was the secret SSSS tier back in vanilla, it is alos a pure dps build.  FOr this reason, its mostly a raid spec.  FOr 5 mans, with any cc, most groups would still prefer a mage, rogue, or warlock dps.
---
ANd outside of pvp gear/pvp rep gear - finding dps upgrades will be hard.
---
streamers didn't flood the servers with their viewers. Blizzard flooded the servers with their fans. Also, they kept the server up for about 26 hours in total, and there was plenty of time to experience the game to level 5.
---
because it's easier to get a known value.
---
And personally i wouldn't mind every era of wow being available for people to play it with it's legit mechanics.
---
Even if it's just to play through all the content properly and transfer a character up through it all the way, that's potentially years of content to explore and enjoy.
---
OR if you have a specific era you like, you can set up home there, and just treat the other eras as a vacation spot to dabble in when you need a break.
---
And by the way.....that "more forward and not even enterain the idea of vanilla servers" sentiment is why it's taken this long for us to get classic.
---
Moving forward in no way means it'll be better and with blizzard's current design teams track-record i don't trust them at all.
---
I'm still skeptical their refurbishment team can do a good job classic itself. But if that works out I'd be willing to trust them to refurbish other eras as well.
---
However completely new content is gonna need some proof they know what they're doing now, and they can show that by fixing BFAs problems. Or whatever comes after.
---
That first fight was just beautiful.
---
ohhhh youre so right lmao
---
It's purely for marketing and hype purposes. Any extra bug reports are just an uncared for side benefit.
---
They practically instant lose to shadow reflectors in duels and in premades they are strictly inferior discpriests.
---
Not viable since it's not even semi optimal.
---
Inspired to play druid lol
---
yeah i think ill still do the quest but just for fun. im rolling orc so not super excited to get a horse ya know
---
I didnt even think of this. good idea! not sure if ill be able to stomach it long enough to get one...but i may try
---
Lol, buy a rockband kick pedal and use it for tauren war stomp.
---
kind of but not really. questing outdoors provides you with nice green gear and the difference between that gear and dungeon gear is a matter of like a few percentage points at most towards your overall dps. and even then it may not result in killing mobs quicker because you may be overkilling mobs with those extra points anyway.
---
TBC with no flying mounts.
---
I am extremely skeptical people will turn down a shaman because it's not an orc. I look forward for you to have a chance to experience this game, and learn about it first hand.
---
Hunters are the easiest to play on a casual level but have the highest skillcap, they are by far the hardest to master (in vanilla that is, don't know about later).
---
You can do insane stuff with them if you are good, like solo high level dungeon bosses for tons of profit, in general fastest xp/gold farmer by far, dominates in every form of PvP (BGs, duels, world PvP), and can do funny stuff like kite world bosses into enemy faction cities, which results in the boss massacring everything.
---
Judging by votes, people got salty still :D
---
I agree with you, I think it was set at 6 months. Our server was just slow at progression, so when a guild from a server that was much older transferred in, the difference was night and day between the players. I think it should be 1 year
---
And then potato druid instead lol
---
sad to say if youre not into pvp thats the only way horde is superior. because ally have alliance you can get the blessing which makes you cause less threat and aside from hit chance threat is what holds your dps down so on ally you can up ur dps a bit. although ally locks never made sense to me because theyre supposed to be evil. i for one wanna be a monster in tier 2 hunting ally down on my armored wolf and never dying
---
both pretty bad lol
---
I played at the beginning of BC and there were plenty of players on azeroth while leveling
---
Been playing vanilla and wotlk pvp for about a decade.
---
There’s a weekly thread where people help you decide. I’ll show you my dilemma and you can see what your situation is like.
---
I’m stuck between rogue and priest. Priest is like the king of finding groups, everyone wants you and you will never struggle. Rogue is the opposite, you will always be struggle to find a group and when you do everyone and their dog rolls against your loot pool. I want to play rogue but if it holds you back from actually playing the content is it worth it?
---
I think you mean the GOAT of fighting Lord Artem Lobov, first of his name ruler of the UFC and Bareknuckle FC, destroyer of faces, Champion of the 9 Weight classes
---
I hear people use them for push to talk voice coms which is convenient for when you need to be pressing your action keys instead of talking.
---
Back then? 8 hours a day. Now? 2.5 hours a day. Life changes, as do interests, commitments, and responsibilities. I would never want to spend 45-50hrs a week playing WoW NOW, like I did as a kid. But I’m going to try to be super efficient with the time I do have and it will still be an absolute blast!
---
What is the point in being so toxic? If he wants to use it let him use it.
---
God I would love them to change the numbers, would only need 10% swings and the game would become so much more competitive for a lot more specs.
---
Bind everything
---
it's what separates good players from the bad
---
Get used to your ctrl,shift,alt modifiers and take advantage of every action on your mouse too.
---
Suuuure bud, well you do you
---
I wonder what entails retarting a tart
---
Of course it is. The game is starting over and you will play it just like everyone else did with no experience when it launched.
---
The good thing is you can watch streamers and youtube vids to learn if you want.
---
Shadow Priest in vanilla doesn't really have much of an engaging playstyle in raids. Assuming you could go all-out without regard for aggro or mana your rotation is basically pressing Mind Blast once in a while, SW:P every 18 seconds and then channeling Mind Flay. Of course this isn't practical or sustainable so best case in real life you might be able to use SW:P and a downranked Mind Flay to keep your debuff up while flicking your wand and dispelling people.

The fuck is a zoomer

I’m not sure on the details, but apparently the classic client will also be updated when the current retail client is as well. The idea is to be able to help improve both at the same time. So while it may be a fork of Legion, it also shares some code with BfA, at least that’s what I’ve gathered.
---
According to Blizzard, 1% of the player base raided in Vanilla.
---
8 million subscribers means 80,000 raiders means 2,000 raid teams means at most 2,000 shadow priests.
---
66 guilds cleared Naxx before TBC dropped.
---
Not good odds.
---
There are some private servers that have instant 60 that allow you to see how classes play at lvl 60  and not burn 240-300 hours on a class you don’t like.
---
It sure was. People were theorycrafting on their own and within their guilds. Forums were there, and that is where a lot of information was shared, discussed and figured out.
---
And they all have a few friends 👍
---
I agree completely, but I didn't want to say those things in the OP :x
---
Yeah, and Theramore made sense since it looked like a big, busy trade port to me. Whereas the Darkshore docks didn't seem like they saw a lot of action. My headcanon is that it was a bustling port town back in the day, but elves are a old race, and so the town became less and less populated over a long period of time, leaving the large dock as the only indication of its previous glory.
---
This.

I know I’m a little late, but I think you’re better off investing in stuff liek boe blues that people are trying to get rid of for some fast money and hang onto them.

I only watch Soda for Druid tips, in case I go Druid. I watched this epic competition on Esfand's stream.
---
are you new to pcs? you can use whatever you want to play with wow. some people use gamepads
---
the key is with 3rd party programs which translate these usb presses into keyboard presses which wow recognizes
---
joy2key is a solid program for that
---
i could play WoW with my fightstick for street fighter if i wanted to , provied i bound the right buttons to the right keys on my keyboard
---
same applies for any other usb macro input device
---
you could use a midi keyboard to play wow with... seriously... its all in 3rd party software
---
You can easily heal dungeons as a shaman.
---
As long  you have a healing spell You can level as any spec and heal dungeons by just slapping some int cloth or whatever
---
What?
---
I don’t give a shit what they’re supposed to be, WoW armor was designed on humans. Fem trolls have good casting animations and wear armor well—especially for casters, particularly priest. 
---
They are ugly as shit and don’t look like what you’d imagine a female troll to be, given males, but if I’m staring at the back of devout or prophecy shoulders, I want a fem troll.
---
Best way is go play on an instant 60 server. Only takes about 30 mins to get a character geared/specced properly at 60 and then you go around grinding things or doing bgs/duels. You'll learn every class very quickly.
---
# That would explain how his 14 year old footage gets him more viewers than his live gameplay.
---
Paladins only start to outclass Priests in single-target healing during AQ40 and they have zero AoE healing ability.
---
At least with Priest, you don't really need to respec to be viable in PVE and group PVP.
---
OP here's the build I ran in Vanilla most of the time:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A8zRxAAEzx3zcA
---
From the build you linked:
---
* Swap 1pt Ret::Deflection into Ret::Vindication. Helps against Warriors/Rogues and serves as a free garbage debuff to make Priest dispel harder.
---
* Swap 1pt Holy::ImpLoH to Holy::UnyieldingFaith. The extra CD on LoH isn't a huge deal since you already should never rely on it, and the extra resist is huge against CC in PvP.
---
Also you may be able to swap Ret::ImpBoM with Ret::Benediction if you already have a Paladin in raid who picks up buffbot talents.
---
I do, just spending some past time telling people what not to do if they want to go far in pvp.
---
Looking to play Human Rogue this time around, as my Dwarf Ret want as much fun the last time around. 
---
Is there a list of MUST HAVE gear/weapons as I level? I know the Westlands chest, Thrash Blade. 
---
Anyone know of a list like that?
---
yup. I'd been suggesting flight form since pretty much after hitting cap. (the original idea being having a bunch of Druid only FPs that were more numerous than the regular ones and could be activated via stormcrow nests. I was a bit disappointed after realizing the Moonglade to Darn/TB was the only special Flight point in the whole game).
---
okay relax man, it's not that serious, just a bad joke it happens.
---
based on this i can tell you were a mage who knew his stuff back in the day
---
had no clue how many fellow casters i had to teach about spell damage and why they might not want their tier gear as much as they felt like they did
---
respect bro
---
You claimed to be a powergamer but this comment outed you as just a roleplayer, lol
---
If you have been playing other MMO's you may be frustrated by the lack of Quality of Life type additions. The fundamental game is fun and rewarding though so I dont see why not.
---
this is why i don't gamble
---
Bet yog regrets that choice
---
&gt;Is there a guide that isn't a deep dive that gives a quick run down on this stuff?
---
People will post plenty of PvP vidoes on classes which should help. Outside of that can either learn a class in wow by leveling it or by PvPing against it.
---
Did you test it working on the Beta?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t-OsvFBiXE
---
 I am not a expert shaman, but I have played with shamans healing (me as tank) rather early in the game. I have specific memories in RFD where they where boss
---
they were joking and fucking around, chill dude
---
I played both extensively prior to BC. 
---
Shadow Priest was great for leveling...probably the best experience I had trying to level a new character. They are a lot of fun in PvP also. I already plan on having a troll priest as my bank alt while i level my first toon.
---
Warlock was the most fun class I played to date I think. It has a lot of quirks that make it unique and interesting. They also in my opinion had more than one viable end game raiding spec, which is rare for a class pre BC.
---
I'm going to play a Tauren Druid. Why? Because I didn't play one before. I'm going to experience Classic through a new and exciting lens. I like the versatility their shape shifting gives me while leveling, and I look forward to playing a support role in Raids as opposed to being DPS like I normally am. (And I think their end game gear looks cool.) :)

all good, better luck next time.

There are more iterations than that, the flight paths changed their path once having the auto queue working. 
---
At first you’d carry out each path, lad and immediately take off again. By late Vanilla (maybe early Bc?) they had smoothed our the paths. If going ratch to .org,you’d still approach XR, but you veer off heading towards org before you would have landed in xr. 
---
I’m okay with either, truly. Just having the flight paths is the pacing I want. The +/- 10-30 seconds on pathing is immaterial to me. 
---
We really can’t have someone with UC and gromgol being able to take a flight path to eachother without having kargath, that’s actually breaking leveling.
---
Warlocks can feel a bit like a hunter with the kiting, but there's a whole other level of resource management going on with warlock's life tap.  Healing-wise Priests are the best healers in Vanilla wow.
---
It's much more effecient to just get a job for 3 months.
---
Source?
---
Best of luck!!! It's an amazing experience you will absolutely love it
---
I wouldn’t say tilted, they were salty for sure but they were laughing really hard about it in the end poking fun at each other
---
Yeah, people typically round up at .5 or above :)
---
His positioning and jumping around during those fights was so bad.
---
Tie between Son of Haakar and Lupos. Not unique skins or anything, but pure workhorses.
---
Son for still doing damage in fights with a lot of bad around the boss. (It'll be a hot sec b4 we can get 'em in classic, and don't technically need to use him once you learn the ability but red is a fine color)
---
Lupos for getting past the armor on bosses. Easy to get on alliance, fun to get on hoard.
---
Either way, doing magical damage with pets has significant coolness factor.
---
how come?
---
What an interesting retort

https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-testing-access-as-of-may-22/179883

Since that announcement, only F&amp;F invites have trickled out.
---
how dare you suggest i spend my time doing something productive that would speed up the time between now and classic wow. I want to mope all day and check if I magically get beta access.
---
Classic is a legion client (7.3.x), 1.12.1 server addons will not work.
---
Thank you, appreciate the direction here
---
Look for a guild on Discord.
---
A) don't level protection.  You'll tank worse with protection spec vs Arms due to rage starvation pre-raids.
---
B) Level arms.  Best PvE/PvP spec for a leveling warrior.
---
C) Get used to being rolled in world PvP unless you get the Jump on them.  Warriors don't really come into their own until you get good gear and it's much worse when you're learning the class.
---
D) Do not quest anywhere with mobs higher level than you.  Mobs that are the same level or lower only.  Warriors absolutely suck against higher level mobs and it will increase your leveling time by at least 25%.
---
Professions I generally recommend herbing/alchy so you'll have enough health pots.
---
Sequisha! The Geshden Republic doesn’t play around!
---
Somethings not quite right....
---
You can rank as fury even in level 60 dungeons. So yeah
---
Heel toe dexterity, drive much?
---
I'll go ham early trying to get to 60 asap. After that though I wont be playing as much as I used to. I have kids and a job now. I dont see it being too much of an impact though, I'm a lot older now and understand the game and my goals better so I will probably play a lot more efficiently even with less total time.
---
Honoslty all WoW sub reddits are full of circle jerks and trolls, I left the wow page pre legion due to this negativity, can really suck the game you love being critized in such a way. I'm all for contructive feedback and talk but generally this isn't that, it's more MYTEAM VS YOUR TEAM mentallity with not much to gain from it
---
Converting a 1.12 addon to the 7.3.5 API is fucking rough. It's much easier to convert Retail addons. It's gonna be a while until we see the popular Vanilla addons that are no longer used in Retail, if ever.
---
Bro you would have MASSIVE calves if you push R14
---
general rule of thumb is 2 handed fury until 40 then you switch to arms for mortal strike. 2 handers are easier to come by (since you only need 1 good one instead of 2 if you're trying to dual wield) and don't suffer from the inherent reduced hit chance of dual wielding.
---
crit is the most important stat for warriors so you want the free 5%, you also want blood craze for early leveling to help with down time.
---
when you do instances just keep a shield and 1 hander around and spam sunder. spec makes almost no difference until higher level for tanking.
---
theoretical fury spec up to 39: 
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZAV0I0xoV
---
arms spec for 40:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxkAio0d
---
after 40 go down the fury tree with basically the same spec you started with. crit, unbridled wrath, blood craze, etc.
---
pick whichever weapon spec you're a fan of and try to just find weapons that match instead of respeccing all the time. hierarchy for weapons is axe&gt;sword&gt;mace&gt;polearm. polearms suck because they're fast. any yellow ability (mortal strike, heroic strike, overpower, even hamstring) scales off your weapon damage so you want the slowest weapon possible. axes can be slow and crit is the best stat, so axes rule.
---
p.s. this is just what i remember from vanilla. probably not absolutely optimal but it should work.
---
best lawlll
---
Depends on how hardcore you want to be. Don’t listen to these people saying you wont find any guilds willing to take you. If you just want to play the game somewhat casually and raid most things pre-naxx then you should be able to find a guild no problem. People vastly overestimate the difficulty of the early raids in vanilla and most of them can easily be killed with 35 out of 40 players so class comp doesn’t have to be finely tuned. Guilds that are looking to get into naxx progression will be less inclined to bring more than 1 SP though.
---
God damn it, I shouldn't have read this comment
---
To be honest, like they said..go in blind. When I started I bought the game because my cousin convinced me to play..I rolled a warriror..and explored...I winded up in the Sepulcher as a level 7-9 warrior. I met Bonezz - a rogue who proceeded to become my mentor in the game, he bought me starter loot for like 10s..gave me some advice...told me how rage worked..showed me how to quest..bascially gave me my in game tutorial. That was my experience on day 1 of WoW lol. Next day I rolled a rogue because I thought he was a badass. He proceeded to teach me how to play that class to the best of his knowledge too, and I've played rogue since vanilla WoW. If you want something authentic go in blind lul.
---
&gt;  there'd be too much damage to feasibly heal. 
---
The elites didn't do that much damage. Healing was pretty easy.
---
Wait, you plan to go first time WARRIOR?! You’re in for a rough ride.
---
You’ll go OOM really fast.
---
&gt;6'4
---
&gt;plays vanilla wow
---
Definitely a sloucher
---
Rage my Soldiers! Scream my Soldiers! Fight my Soldiers!
---
You shouldn't play beta even if you were a veteran vanilla player tbh.
---
Classic wow isn't the kind of game where you can get quick fixes and be done, it's all or nothing and investing any time into beta when all that progress is going to be utterly deleted literally 2 months from now is folly, not to mention you risk getting burnt out.
---
Sorry that was a bit off topic, anyway hope you enjoy experiencing classic for the first time!
---
I've had times like that where your heart rate is going mad praying nobody beats you to it - it's a rush :)
---
Congrats and can I please has gold plz
---
First time I've read / heard this and thanks for the truth and the laugh :)
---
It's all about that center wheel click. Razer 12 key pad on the mouse is easy mode for my rouge.

https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AAQzA8BABD_TDBM
---
Thank you!
---
AV queue times took literal days on some servers. No thanks.
---
Gotcha, thank you!
---
Rotations are simpler but threat management adds a layer to it. Also dungeons require CC and organization to clear you can just run through and AoE everything.
---
With classic we'll likely see content going down quickly unless they modify it in some way. All of the strats are available and everyone knows (or can find the info) how to min/max to clear MC/Ony immediately. I doubt it'll take more than 1-2 weeks for them to be cleared.
---
You also had issues of lag, dcs, etc that could plague your raid back then. We also won't have that issue as most computers can now run WoW (classic) at 60+fps no problem. Back in the day you could drop to 5-15fps on some fights.
---
It will be a much different experience, but I'm excited. I will likely take the week of release off.
---
Excellent resource, thanks
---
Nothing in that post leaves me to believe that there wont be anymore invites. Just not many in the near future.
---
Superior laziness. Right hand for raiding, left hand for snacks and PTT
---
Wonderful, thank you!
---
R E N T F R E E
---
Gotta remember the loud bunch of people is generally only the 5%
---
okay then make av cross server, but make wsg/ab same server or maybe two servers.  There HAS to be a compromise.   With cross server there just is no vanilla community(which is the reason to play over bfa or other mmo)
---
&gt; We have met our current population needs for testing
---
The beta has two purposes: testing and marketing.
---
They don’t need more testers.
---
love how the goalpost moved...
---
could you point out which patch specifically made classic so much easier for the lvl 30 game?
---
you can use it in dungeons but not raids.
---
it's pretty much just SnD up &gt; SS &gt; Evis to not waste points.
---
If you don't have many SM/Ruin locks you might be able to steal a debuff slot if you can prove your rupture will do enough damage to over-power the difference of an evis + corruption to overall raid dps.
---
Not necessarily, if you’re doing the whole dungeon with the group, it’s common courtesy to do it for free. But if you get the key, And a group needs somebody to open the door, you can open it for them and make anywhere  from 10g-15g just to open it then leave. Making your hearth Kargath helps a lot too
---
WHAT ABOUT mini tyrael????
---
S tier will always be a good healer! The difference between utter defeat and total domination can be one great healer!!
---
Gotcha! Thank you!
---
Again, no thanks.
---
If you want to feel as part of a community, go PVP out in the world. Even a queue of 1 hour is unacceptable.
---
Back in vanilla I BG’d with a priest who had psychic scream bound to one of these, like a panic pedal
---
Do you know if you can get enough mats as a gnome? UD area has humanoid mobs that drop linen.

---
Hunter Bow!!
---
Rogue slams dps meters for PvE (above most mages/warriors/warlocks) so you're a high prio slot
---
Level 11 to get it but some of the mobs are 15-17
---
The pets are 32 they get glanced a lot less than the warrior.
---
I found Paladin to be more miserable because of how fucking boring it is.
---
I'd suggest setting keybinds one by one. Learn them in batches of 1~3 at a time. It's easier to drill them into your mind that way. 
---
I'd also suggest keeping certain skills the same for all the classes you play. Like 'x' could always be a stun, or 'r' could always be a defensive cd. etc. 
---
And think about how the hand movements will be -- like which is easier for you, shift+1 or alt+1? How does Ctrl feel? Get a good idea of what your preferences are in the 'keyboard feel' department.
---
Stance Dance Revolution!
---
&gt;the only change I'd personally like is attunements never being removed
---
I hope not! Those requirements were exhausting, and fun, and then you realized not only were you going to have to do it all again on an alt, you were going to be helping all the newbs! It was glorious.
---
Thanks for this, any idea what the name of the quest is? I'd like to head for it as soon as I can.
---
TBH I feel like delaying cross-realm BGs would be good until the last phase, or implementing a same-realm first matchmaking system.
---
In late Vanilla playing was mostly boring since our Naxx-geared group was much, much better geared than even the top Horde raiders/PvPers. Once they added xrealm we finally got some competition from the top guild on another server who were similarly progressed.
---
I just want to play vanilla before cross realm, thats it.  I don't want to have to play a private server for that.  I don't want a work around I just want pre cross realm vanilla.
---
Somebody else made this comment, but I'd like to reiterate it. The truth is that the time I would need to invest to make enough gold to pay for a month is probably way more than just working part time/freelance/basically anything that pays for a few hours to make the 15$
---
Quivers and Ammo pouches are broke right now not allowing autoshot to work. the fix is to remove your quiver all together and just store ammo in your bags. losing your 10%-12% bonus.  but at least it works after that.  Before this bug showed up last night the quiver  would some times stop feeding ammo to the paper doll.  im sure it will get fixed sooner than later.
---
A few addon developers are in the beta.
---
From what we understand, the API is very similar to retail - so folks are porting retail-&gt;1.13. Swing timers, cast bars, damage meters etc have been ported over already.
---
I feel targeted

Don't you love all the kiddos who didn't even play during vanilla downvoting you for this?
---
The hunters were playing to absolute perfection
---
All good points. I remember my framerate was around 7-8 when I first started raiding MC as an Undead Rogue. I was middling at best, in terms of damage produced, but then I built a new computer myself with the highest end NVIDEA graphics card available and within two weeks I was doing like twice as much damage. It was awesome.
---
&gt; I just want pre cross realm vanilla
---
Sorry, but you’re not getting it. Blizzard was pretty adamant about have XR BGs in their Blizzcon talks and they haven’t budged since.
---
Tailoring will give you a few good power spikes in gear while leveling (if you spend gold/time leveling it while leveling). Alch is sustainable long-term since people always need flasks.
---
Healing as shadow viable like tanking as arms while leveling?
---
I remember my epic warlock mount costing somewhere around 600 (had to farm some mats). The quest line is also really great.
---
mmoRPG with extra emphasis on the RPG. Retail has killed all elements of role-playing and class distinction. It’s so sad
---
Ummmm....it's called "content that's been done over and over again on private servers for 13-14ish years".  There's no big mystery to it anymore.  Is it supposed to be undertuned simply because players know how to faceroll it after years of practice?
---
It was pretty hilarious how abysmal his damage was, but he explained numerous times why the hunters were so powerful in comparison, and why, despite the lack of damage, he actually contributed a lot to the overall group.
---
And the two most sought-after drops
---
More of this please!
---
Esfand was specced as protection, not ret for this fight. He was primarily there to buff the other players and the two tigers, and he also helped with healing.
---
He is right, Even resto spec shamans will need an off healer on some pulls. Shamans are a support class. Leave healing to priests.
---
The point of this post is just to raise awareness and try to get attention on this issue.  If blizzard puts in one non xserver, I would play there and pay 30 a month.   If not, maybe I'll just play league of legends.
---
A lot of paladins in my guild, including me were Prot / Holy. in PVP i would use a shield and heal and take abuse but when I got to on the reck count i would try to put on a 2h and attack an enemy healer or whatever target my warrior was on to try and help take them out.
---
but then go back to healing.
---
Troll.  You posted the exact same reply to another post in the thread.  Stay on private servers.  Enjoy!
---
Who do you like better succmexxx?
---
so let me get this straight. people defend streamers getting access because it helps get new players to try this game, that otherwise wouldn't (which is a good thing). But you are okay with him "trolling" or purposely misleading people that don't know? I don't think this is the case.
---
I watched him a few times. He does not report bugs, unless they hinder his gameplay. bugs that help him? He is like "fuck it, I am glad it's there right now #nochanges." He even told his streamers to not report the hunters mark stacking in his SM group video he did today,  until after they cleared the dungeon.  He knows it was fucked to say that, which is why it was editted out of the youtube upload. This is was caused all the viewers on sodapopping and soniidigital to call alliance cheaters. The few bug reports Ive seen him do on stream. It was out of frustration and anger after the bugs cost him the match. Like when that flag carrier got feared through the wall. Dude couldn't even type straight he was so triggered. Dude is massive egotist that cares more about his hair than doing his part to inform newbies so they get excited to try classic. Blizzard did theirs. Asmond even got his friend (Mcconnel something or other) an invite after he begged blizzard on stream for one.
---
TL:DR Asmond should just shave his head already.
---
Never invest more than25% of your liquid gold.but sometimes you need to spend money to make money. Good story! Great job future AH goblin.  Auction house pvp is the best way to play wow.
---
They will make more money by keeping the integrity if the game. Believe it!
---
You're in a minority, a very small minority. Blizzard isn't going to fork their business model and playerbase for any reason, especially not a minority reason.
---
It isn’t rude it’s factual. You’re rude for telling me what to do, delete your existence please.
---
That's fine too! There's nothing wrong with being a duel-focused guy. 
---
There's just a server type specifically designed for that kind of approach.

You can roll a holy reckoning build and be fine for PvP and PvE.  Truthfully, your PvP roll is still a healing/team support role if you're looking to have the most impact.
---
The PvE sets were designed around the primary raiding specs, so for Paladin it's not too bad compared to, lets say a Warrior who simply would struggle to PvP as Prot.
---
If you're wanting to go Ret or Ret reckoning you'll have to get a second set of gear and respec.  That's the price players have to pay to excel at both PvE and PvP.
---
With Illumination, you can raid heal without too many problems. It's actually pretty clutch for a Paladin to get Blessing of Sanctuary. 
---
Just to note -- reckoning doesn't work with forced crits via /sit. So that takes some of the potency away.
---
To answer some of the questions;
---
2) Basically yes. Blizzard (at the time) said that tier sets should play to the classes strengths. Dreadnaught was 1/2 dps, 1/2 tanking. Dreamwalker was full resto. Redemption was full holy. Etc.
---
3) If you want to respec often, you'll need gold - yes. If you want to PvP, you'll likely need some off-pieces, even if you're the same spec.
---
4) It's good in PvP
---
5) The Seal hits do a spell damage calculation, from what we know right now. This needs to be tested more, though. Things like Frost oil and shadow oil need to be tested, too.
---
6) Verigan's Fist is dope (if you can get it at lv30)
---
As someone who raided through vanilla as a mage. In Molten Core, Zul Gurub and Blackwing Lair you are doing polymorph, decurse, AoE and Frostbolts. In AQ40 and Naxx when you are fire spec frostbolt get replaced with Scorch, Fireball. It’s not “only frost bolt spam” even though it’s a large part of it. 
---
With that said I’m probably not going mage again.
---
At first glance I thought this was a trusty old notepad filled with the names of your gankers on it to which one day you would exact revenge upon. 
---
I wrote mine down on the wall behind my monitor and to the left side of the fist mark.
---
Oh big yikes telling someone to kill themselves because they said your post was rude. Very classy and not sociopathic at all
---
Thanks a lot and good job on the run!
---
played warrior in TBC thru LK.
---
I was like 14 or 15 and I can remember my friends and I would set alarms in the summer for the moment our parents left for work, get online, play all day until right when parents came home so we could act like we hadn’t played wow all day, and then eat dinner and afterwards be like “well, I’m gonna play wow for a little bit” and stay up playing from dinner time until as late as possible before repeating the whole process....all summer long. I can also remember telling my parents that i “had to be home by x time for the raid” so often my dad started to get pissed, like I’d be out with family seeing a movie or something tripping about making it back in time for MC so I didn’t lose my raid spot. Got server first MC and BWL clears, I was one of the best geared rogues on our server and I remember wearing my blood fang shit and people inspecting me and PMing me like I was a celebrity. I was really, really obsessed with wow lol
---
Going Orc as I plan to play a lot of enhancement. Otherwise always trolls.
---
It did. But doubt they will have as many servers. I don’t like cross realm at all. But understand the benefits so it is what it is imo
---
I use a Corsair scimitar mouse and bind all of my CDs potions and trinkets to it on a second bar. I also use a razer orbweaver gaming pad that has 12 bindings that I use for my main skills and the pad has a thumb stick that is bound to WASD.
---
I couldn’t imagine playing wow without them.  What a nightmare.
---
No changes.
---
People are completely free to sit at whatever level range they want for as long as they want. Hell I did so on my rogue.
---
But it was my choice to do so.
---
I'd straight up refuse to play until the limits were removed because they were never part of vanilla. The level cap was 60 at release and 60 is what it will be when I sub.
---
Lol, that's the most hilariously pessimistic thing I've ever heard! You're right dude, whatever will we do now that the level 30 meta is ruined!? Hahaha. You're a funny guy mate, cheers.
---
Just use will of the forsaken to remove that fear
---
If you have retail installed, the beta/stresstest is ~4gb ish. 
---
Without retail some folks were saying it's 7gb.
---
I have to say...I BG’d a ton in vanilla / BC and I felt a rivalry within my battle group. Even rolled alts on some other servers to try to kill players I disliked.  
---
I just hope they do their best to keep PvP servers in the same battlegroups, pve servers in theirs and RP servers in theirs, these all attract different kinds of players that really generally don’t enjoy playing together in my experience.
---
Or maybe hes trolling so hard that he became retarded. hmm.
---
I see the predicament. My rationale for your situation would make me think you truly want to play rogue, but you need to find a good group of players to level with so that you’re not competing so much w others for gear/dungeon spots. I wouldn’t go for a class simply because you can always find a dungeon or whatnot, at least that’s my logic. 
---
For me, I’m going to primarily be leveling with my brother who is going dwarf hunter. I’m stuck between rogue/mage/warlock. Mages and warlocks because I’ve never really gotten into a caster class so I thought it would be interesting and the mages aoe proficiency, raw dps capability, and utility like portals and conjuration which is pretty cool to me. Warlocks have their niche which I think is cool too plus good utility from curses, soulstones, summoning, and the class specific mounts, but I’m worried about inventory space of soul shard management and it seems like their overall weaker than mages. I also don’t really want to roll a gnome bc I like having my gear show but everyone says they’re the unanimous caster race for their intellect racials. Rogues because I like the feeling of equipping a weapon as opposed to a staff or something and the whole stealth/lockpicking aspect is intriguing as well, and cons for the same reason you mentioned. 
---
Needless to say I’m pretty on the fence lol.
---
Love enhancement. I always go with that tree and then that last few points into resto
---
Getting attacked for no reason, camped while leveling, etc. is an inherent risk one assumes when they choose to play on a pvp server. If you do not want to deal with that risk, there are servers for you to play in. It's really as simple as that.
---
I would sure hope noone would be in vent
---
Levels 20-30 will give you a good idea.
---
You would lose the 5/5 in both Divine Favor and Holy Power.  These are pretty essential for Holy paladins - they are what make us the most efficient healer. 
---
Since Divine Favor Return 100% of the mana cost when you crit and Holy Power flat ups your crit. 
---
You could do it but i wouldnt recomend it. Far better to take the role of support in cycling Blessing of Freedom and blessing of sacrifice, along with cleansing people. 
---
You wont really have enough attack power to Make the reck hits all too scary. 
---
And sit to crit wont work. Which is what made reckoning good.
---
Lmfao try 6'4, sgt in the infantry. 100% dont slouch
---
While he shouldn't of said that, you also should go to bed, its past your bedtime kiddo.
---
At least DKP gives you a chance:
---
Lets say you joined a guild as a rogue and you raid all the time ,but the older ones in the guild have 5-6 items more and better weps.. no matter what you do, you will be behind on dps compared to them!
---
DKP gives you chance to save and spend for the items that will give you best dps increase and you will eventually catch up and have a chance to prove better with equal gear, better understanding of mechanics , better cd timing on encounters and so on... 
---
If no dkp and the loot is given to those that does the most ... you will always be behind if you not started progression together, even if you are the better one!
---
Who played on a CRT in 04/05?  Perhaps if you had a very old PC but I'm pretty sure you couldn't buy one in 05 in a standard store and if you wanted one you had to go to niche/specialist stores.
---
Rogue question: does the "Murder" talent work against other players? I've seen conflicting information about this, so please provide source (or explain why you think the answer is yes/no)
---
Totally agree. If there is not personal enjoyment while earning that gold than by all means screw that idea.
---
Center wheel is ptt for
---
Was there ever a point where battlegrounds were 21:30, 31:40 etc? or am I just remembering things wrong? I could've sworn at some time battlegrounds topped off at round numbers but I can't find anything supporting that. I remember when 10-19 was added but also that there was a point where some people had their special spells and mounts while others couldn't since level 40s were grouped with lower levels.
---
I’m predominantly a pve player, only run premades when I’m super bored of leveling lol. I’m gonna be somewhere in the middle of competitive and casual, I’m not gonna grind for rank 14 or anything but I’ll definitely be investing a pretty substantial amount of time at my own pace and try to knock down some endgame raids. I’m going to primarily be leveling with my brother who is going dwarf hunter. I’m stuck between rogue/mage/warlock. Mages and warlocks because I’ve never really gotten into a caster class so I thought it would be interesting and the mages aoe proficiency, raw dps capability, and utility like portals and conjuration which is pretty cool to me. Warlocks have their niche which I think is cool too plus good utility from curses, soulstones, summoning, and the class specific mounts, but I’m worried about inventory space of soul shard management and it seems like their overall weaker than mages. I also don’t really want to roll a gnome bc I like having my gear show but everyone says they’re the unanimous caster race for their intellect racials. Rogues because I like the feeling of equipping a weapon and seeing my melee dps numbers go up as opposed to wielding a staff or something and the whole stealth/lockpicking aspect is intriguing as well. Sorry for the essay lol

There are a large portion of people who are anti cross realm bg's.   It should be possible to find a compromise to give players like me what they want as well.   It would definetly be worth making 1-2 servers with non cross realm.   The whole point of classic is because of people not wanting modern changes that were put into wow.
---
Classic is running off of a 8.x client. Why you people keep insisting that it's running 7.3.5 is beyond me.
---
You don't like battlegrounds because you don't recognize names?  You should take the time to learn who is in your battle group then.  I knew plenty of players that weren't from my server in TBC because they were always in BG's, were good players, or were talked about on the forums.
---
Battle groups are an extension of your server and don't change so the players you fight are still consistent.  You'll still remember them, and you'll still fight your own servers players too.  Definitely fixes more than it breaks.
---
In PVE, you wear cloth all the way until Naxx.
---
In PVP, you want the armor that plate provides.
---
Personally i think it would be cool to have these changes as a limited time event or something, not forever
---
I'm not even sure why i'm commenting but because i don't really care. But hes basing he says Tauren time is too slow because mobs are too spread. He should have no problem kiting one mob to the next without wasting time. I mean this is kind of basic leveling shit for any melee class.
---
Green Day: American Idiot album on loop
---
See, the whole problem about loot council in classic is the 40 man raids part. 10 man raids? Yeah, loot council is the best. 20/25 man raids? Loot councils work if your loot council works well.
---
In a 40 man raid, it is much more difficult. There are a ton of cliques, which make loot council almost a political situation. Then you have the sheer numbers; was raider 39/40 at all raids this week? The one he wasn't at, did we sit him because of class composition or did he not show up? Etc.
---
DKP makes it all tracked pretty much automatically. There are some issues with DKP that make it sub-optimal to an efficient and unbiased loot council, but for the vast majority of players, it will be a good way to reduce guild drama. I'd suspect top guilds would still use loot council though.
---
As far as I remember, it was always 10-19, 20-29, etc.
---
To add to this, skinning is taken to vendor everything you get to NPCs in an attempt to afford your mount at 40. I've read that if you're a bit stingy with your gold, and only use it to buy the abilities you need to level, you should have enough (or nearly so) at 40. It also helps that unlike Herb/Mining, you have no competition other than the mobs you need to kill.
---
As for Mining, I'm less sure. If I had to guess it would be because professions that need mining are far more popular initially, in a fresh start situation. So the demand for ore/bars should be higher than herbs to start with. Also helps that since ore-needing professions are more popular, it's probably more likely for a player to pick one of those professions up; Engineering especially seems to be a popular choice across many classes.

Not really. They're familiar with a very incorrect and illegal version of vanilla. They shouldn't be allowed anywhere near Classic.
---
No daddy I’m gonna stay awake

Weren’t cross realm bgs implemented in vanilla though?

Wait till he see the downvotes and he will delete his comment while sipping on his warm soy milk before going to bed.

A few leveling guides include a list of important weapons to get. For swords, I'd recommend Kargoz's: https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/rogue/leveling-1-60/

Wew lad
---
It really doesn't matter.   Cross realm was a mistake, and the game before it was added was better.   that is the whole reason for people wanting vanilla back - the server community
---
Dumbest shit I’ve heard all week thank u

RemindMe! 3 months
---
I had that. It ruled.
---
A temporary reduction of the level cap creates new challenges and meta without affecting the core game in any way. It's essentially a new and novel way to play and old game, but as long as it's temporary and not affecting the actual game upon release, people aren't complaining.
---
Increasing the level cap on the other hand is generally a much more permanent measure, and effectively negates all the work that players and developers put into end-game content and progression. Making that much game content meaningless, especially when it was previously some of the most *meaningful* content in the game is a pretty major downside.
---
And from an immersion/narrative perspective, it caused problems. The "tone"of the game got more serious the higher level you got. But as the level cap increases, that sense of danger and urgency  becomes hollow. It's hard to take the game seriously once you and a handful of mates can casually stroll on down to the Molten Core to kill THE FREAKING ELEMENTAL LORD OF FIRE for fun during your free time.

How big the crits are doesn't matter, except for PvP.
---
The reason slower weapons are better is because certain abilities scale off % weapon damage. So if most of your DPS is coming from an ability that is based on % weapon damage, you want a slower weapon that does more damage on each swing
---
Oh god.
---
Now I can't unsee it!
---
Most of the game in vanilla was before cross realm.   Cross realm came with naxx - a lot of the game was before that and it made things a lot worse.   We HAD to deal with it because there was no alternative - it was in the game.   But it's part of the changes to this day that made the game worse that need to be reversed.
---
Don’t worry about racials, they are negligible.
---
I think the choice is between mage and rogue for you. And to solve that I think you should just do the launch day forced decision method. Pick one and stick with it!
---
My first character was a priest named Shiningblade. Hehe, in retrospect not thematically good.
---
Yeah they work but you have to figure out what keys to duplicate onto the pedals. Binding modifiers to the pedals (e.g. Ctrl+F12) can be somewhat of a pitfall since if you hit the pedal and a key at the same time the modifier will apply to the key as well. Plus everything that's already been said regarding the mechanics of tapping your finger versus pushing a foot pedal.
---
Some dungeon quests are really worthwhile, especially if you're a melee class and the quest gives you a big weapon upgrade.
---
Ok cool, pretty much just comes down to caster vs melee dps then. Thanks!
---
You're right.  Originally there BG brackets started at 21-30.  When the changes were made, only AV stayed 51-60, everything else was x0-x9.
---
Warlock sm/ruin and mage winters chill
---
MC they can tank with warriors on par, but once BWL comes out warriors pull ahead hard, and until the bear gets some of the AQ/World dragon loot they are still basically OT dedicated.
---
The great thing about bringing them however, is you gear 1 less plate tank warrior, and keep an extra fury warrior DPS. With the bear having the ability to throw on his healing or dps set at the drop of a hat for whatever the fight requires. 
---
Feral tanking was my most fun experience in private servers but it is easily the most time consuming if you want to push it to its full potential. All the rep farming, and getting 3 gear sets takes a long time commitment lol.
---
They rebranded their company or something and have made a new kickstarter for LFG, so maybe they'll actually get the movie done within the foreseeable future
---
I'll buy a copy right now no lie.
---
While racing the other team who has a certain warrior who can't do anything without blaming everyone else for his failures and finds it impossible to take responsibility for anything lol. Was fun to watch
---
the fact that we're using 1.12 is arbitrary.   The only reason were using 1.12 is because naxx came out that patch and that is the only working patch that private servers have available to work off of.   The fact that we are using the cross realm patch is ARBITRARY.  Over two years of vanilla was with no cross realm.   Cross realm was a change by blizzard like dungeon finder that had the same effects.
---
understanding the implications of cross realm and advocating for a better experience for everyone does put you in a small minority, unfortunately
---
it's tiresome arguing with idiots addicted to their "wall of no" mentality, and it's tiresome to point out what is self evident in face of their "durrrhurr i had no problem knowing everyone in my 300,000 player battlegroup durrhurr" 
---
at least we can all agree that one of the pillars of vanilla is sacrificing community in favor of convenience and ensuring no one has to wait more than 10 minutes for a bg queue
---
suddenly people vehemently against cross realm are a-okay implementing it when it doesn't affect them because they won't get passed rank 5 and were going to be a total nobody on their server anyway
---
I use orc for warlocks 🤘
---
:rage:
---
I've been using one for years, bought it on Amazon. However, I don't use it for skills, I use it for things like push-to-talk on VoIP. The idea is that I can have important stuff like skills on convenient keyboard/mouse buttons, and have other less important stuff on them.
---
Hi, /u/shanizzle1212
---
Yea I know, I understand his view that he's playing the class, not the spec. But since he's meleeing as a paladin, most people view it as Ret and a waste.
---
I just love his whole take on the "support class". It's what I loved about playing druid in vanilla. So many people don't seem to get the idea of a support class.
---
Straight up though, I'm seriously surprised the Orcs didn't ban Warlock magics after what it did to Draenor and how the Burning Legion used it to corrupt them.
---
to get around the map *slightly* faster
---
Yes id say Classic is the perfect jumping-in point.
---
Just do yourself a favor and restrain yourself from using addons or internet research for the full classic experience. 
---
If you can find one of the WoW walkthrough books from 10 years ago that would be great too. I remember me and my friends gawking over that huge book for ages trying to get everything we could done
---
Mage will give you ports, food/water while leveling. A hunter pet and a mage snare (frostbolt) you'll be able to kill a lot, plus polymorph and traps, for groups of mobs or adds.
---
Great dps, great in pve/pvp.
---
You are a bit of a special little sperg aren't you buddy
---
it was always easy
---
Priest is the better healer, both will be desired as horde-side they're the best two healers. 
---
Level Enhancement or you'll lose your mind drinking every 2 mobs (it's also good in PvP leveling up). I think Shaman &amp; Priest are both fine levelers. 
---
I don't recall how good ele shaman was in PvP, but Enhance was fun &amp; decent because you if you proc a good Windfury you blow people up.
---
Blizzard did not need private servers to get Classic working in the slightest. It was one developer that took the old 1.12 code and ported it to work with the 7.3.5 engine.
---
We're using 1.12 because it represented Blizzard's best efforts and balance before TBC dropped.
---
the answer is that it depends on when. 
---
Early on? No. 2hd Fury is better.
---
DW does a LITTLE better than it did in vanilla proper since we're post-normalization, but you still lack you need to make the spec really sing.
---
However in and beyond BWL DW over takes 2hd fury and then everyone else.
---
Oh jesus christ you weren't kidding, this is horrible lol

It makes me legit depressed irl.  For real.   Feels like such a lost opportunity - like we could have had what we had before but it's ruined by this small thing people are defending.
---
Don't go Druid if you don't want to heal in raids. If you are just doing dungeons, then you could tank.
---
Gnome Warlock.
---
They look awesome, warlock fucks people up in PvP and they're fun as hell.
---
You're under the impression that players care whether or not the enemies in BGs are recognizable. They don't.
---
Right? Orcs will pursue anything in the name of absolute power though. Corruption is just a side effect lol
---
I'm going zappyboi-mode this time. One good thing about BFA was the trailer and we got to see a troll shaman in action.
---
IT'S YA BOY
---
/s
---
What about phase one? Is the bloodvine set going to be part of that? If not, I am not going to take tailoring.
---
unfortunately i don't know about gnome levelling, but i'm guessing trolls and troggs?
---
Warrior, Warlock, Priest is a really strong 3 stack and Warlock is really fun to play!
---
Berserk is a great racial for casting too
---
Yes, totally viable, and unlike other classes you do not (necessarily) need another set of gear. Because spirit tap (or whatever it is called) is such a huge part of the shadow leveling build, you're already stacking tons of spirit. Just go out of shadow form and pick up and extra couple abilities for flash heal/renew/fade and you are golden. You can get all the way to 60 dungeons easily.
---
Every class is fun.
---
Every class has a viable spec in PVP.
---
Every class has a viable spec in PVE.
---
You don't need to make the decision now and the decision is never permanent.
---
Boomkin is truly the only "hot garbage" endgame PvE spec. 
---
There are some other specs that are bad, but Boomkin isn't a thing in classic (though its a fun meme build if you're into that)
---
We're also using 1.12 due to momentum - since private servers used it, blizzard went with it since it's what players are familiar with.   Private servers don't have to address this issue - there is never cross realm on private servers.   
---
The problem is most of vanilla was pre cross realm and that is what people are chasing.   With cross realm it's not going to be that same experience.  You will HAVE to play on private servers, even after classic wow comes out, to have that real vanilla experience(the good one).   Everything after cross server was terrible.
---
cool, I do like the aoe damage abilities that they brings to the table to deal w adds
---
ret pally. equally useless in both pve and pvp so low expectations all around
---
id suggest mage, lock, hunter to new players
---
priest is not too bad leveling but warrior sucks to level
---
if you go alliance priest you need to go dwarf so thats out , id only consider horde priest
---
"u know its not a vanilla server; its classic" \*logs\*
---
There was something charmingly condescending about that.
---
They will do more invites. They do for every beta, they just said that to lower people’s expectations. They 100% will do more waves in June and July.
---
Christ....you can tell all the cancer retail kids have come to the subreddit....
---
Inb4 salt downvotes or "hurrr I've played since f&amp;f alpha" or "omg it's always been toxic"
---
The streamers will make it known for sure, because their followers have to roll on there. Also, there will only be handful of wow streamers that will affect a server, some may even go on the same server, opposite factions, to battle each other.
---
Streamer servers will be the minority, by far.
---
Buddy, hf being awesome, but you sound like a pretentious dickhead.
---
Ret pally viable in PvE, oof.
---
I feel like loot council just invites more problems than it solves.
---
Then stay on your private server.
---
I have to do this for my paladin auras :O
---
Good luck with that sword. Extremely rare.
---
I said every class has A viable spec. Not that every spec is viable.
---
The word current is pretty important.
---
This guy pianos
---
It has effects that aren't immediately clear on the surface.  It's something people DO care about but it is not something you think about in the moment.   The problem is, people knowing what you do gives what you do value.   When you pull off an amazing play in pvp, if people you know see it, it gives what you do value.   It's psychology based.   It's something people don't want to talk about because it makes them look weird or bad but it's the truth - people want to be part of a community and have their actions matter.
---
8/10 easy leveling though? That's basically autopilot level.
---
I have a hard time imagining most players thinking mage is easy to level. Squishy + constantly drinking.
---
Only triggered neckbeards block people anywhere on the internet btw. How’s that soy milk?
---
My only max level ever was a gnome and my one gripe was that the gear was so small on that gnome frame of his lol
---
I want to play real vanilla wow before cross server.   I am asking blizzard to make a server for people like me.
---
I had a mod called (i think) Kill Emote. It would do emptes from a selected list on killing blows.  Great for /spitting on people in pvp before the could release.
---
could have listed for more if you'd have listed them one by one
---
Awesome, thanks for your input. Think I am going to go priest after all. That quells me quite a bit.
---
Right click a mob, tab out and watch a minute of netflix, tab back in. Repeat x15285068 and you're 60! I think Paladin and Hunter can be leveled up in the most hands-off kind of way.
---
Sure, if a bunch of Beta players quit playing, they'll send more invites out. Doubt that will happen though.
---
Don't all the doors shut ? Couldn't they put down a hunter trap and kite the boss 'through' the door after it's shut? Of course someone will have to sacrifice themselves to trigger the boss.
---
Get a healing gear set, it doesn't have to be anything special.
---
You can heal just fine while being elemental, or even enhancement, as long as you have a basic set of healing gear.
---
Going enhancement dps won't make you more attractive for dungeons.
---
Priests were always higher in demand than shaman in raids in vanilla. You really only need 1-2 shaman but for fights like Huhuran you'd want 8 priests.
---
Enh is faster leveling by far, imp. GW is a must have and then 2h weapons.
---
I've been in some great guilds with loot councils. If you are a loot whore, of course you will babyrage every time someone gets a piece of loot instead of you, so a loot council guild may not be for you.
---
will the characters from beta reset? or will people in the beta have a headstart?
---
Think of every toon you'd like to roll in classic. Right down to the name. Create it on retail take 2 hrs and ding 60. Get someone in trade to run you through a few 60 dungeons/raids and park your horrible mismatched toon on a mailbox or roof or somewhere nostalgic. Take a screenshot and pretend its your vanilla character right where you left him. Soak up karma. Then when classic drops get the new version same shit same place and post a then and now side by side with a long nobody cares shpill about how your life has changed in 15 years. Soak up more karma.
---
I think a lot of it has to do with the state of both guilds and the server.  Does the poacher's guild have a tendency of burning through new recruits?  Does the poachee's guild have a lot of drama problems?  Are there players with bad reputations in the guild on either side?  Hell, the different raid days/times can make it worth it for a person to switch.
---
Sometimes leaving a guild that you have a lot of ties to, but has a lot of extra stress/drama, is worth it.  I did that back in the day when my IRL friends kept causing drama and were guild hopping a ton due to it (and I, stupidly, followed).  I eventually broke off from the group and found an awesome home for my WoW time.
---
I don't think it is as simple as /u/Lysah made it out to be, but it also happens all the time for a lot of reasons.
---
Careful, the mods here are pretty strict on rule 4. Mentioning servers by name isn't advised
---
In Classic I was consistently tied or above our best performing mages sometime around ZG (when we started our MC progression) the main problem I recall is having threat issues (I think Ice Block resets aggro iirc). 
---
If you're a tryhard you can do very well, but if a mage is a tryhard they'll probably be a bit above you. It's still competitive.
---
&gt; people knowing what you do gives what you do value
---
This is such a flawed and terrible way of looking at the world. You should not depend on the recognition of others for validating and appreciating your accomplishments.
---
Run dps meter, boot em. /s
---
I'm going to lay down some knowledge on you, because it's obvious you're just spewing things without really understanding what you're talking about.
---
When an animator creates an animation for a skeletal rig, they have the ability to translate the entire object they're animating in 3d space by moving what is typically called a "root node".  It's usually the lowest index bone in the skeletal system, or a custom reference node that has been setup to translate the object by the animator's toolset.
---
Anyway, like I said: when the animator moves this node, the animated mesh translates in space.  Now, when animating a walk/run cycle for a character with feet, the animator will take great care to translate the mesh in proportion to the motion being done by the feet.  This is so the animation looks natural with regards to the foot movement.
---
Now, here's the interesting part:  Some games will choose to throw out the translation of this root node.  Why?  Well, a walk/run cycle can be affected by things like character buffs and debuffs, which will scale the movement speed of the character.  When you have a situation like this, the game developers will often choose to divorce the speed that the animator chose from the resulting speed of the animation.  There are a myriad of reasons why developers do this, but like I mentioned before:  It's typically done in multiplayer games for the sake of server corrections and client prediction.  Another reason is that once an animation is made, the animation speed is set in stone.  If gameplay designers chose to change the speed of the character's movement, and the entire motion of the character were based on the root node's translation, then it creates a bottleneck of work to where gameplay designers are dependent up on animators to change the speed of the character.  
---
Anyway, TL:DR;  you have no idea what you're talking about.  You can replace the entire walk cycle of every character in wow with a jump animation and it won't affect the translation speed of the character over terrain.  The two systems are divorced and do not affect one another.
---
Me repeatedly checking my WoW tab in blizzard launcher, hoping for access :(
---
Boss doesn't leave the room IIRC
---
And again, at Blizzcon, they were pretty adamant that they weren't going to and have stuck to those guns. You're pissing in the wind.
---
I think it's the opposite. Free SBs from corruptions stacked on multiple targets turns you into a turret on trash (and you have more debuff slots available across trash so you can throw out extra dots).
---
There are about as many pros as there are cons to this.
---
&gt;If no dkp and the loot is given to those that does the most ... you will always be behind if you not started progression together, even if you are the better one!
---
That's not true, if it is a bigger upgrade for you, you may get it. Loot council does not go on who does the top dps, that wouldn't make sense...
---
In your scenario, you will be behind in dkp and will only be able to outbid people who already have that piece of gear or weapon, or else they will have more dkp to outbid you.
---
Fucking love Esfand so much. Glad he blew up.
---
Plenty of streamers cover up in game chat with their camera so they don't have to be responsible for policing it. If someone starts dropping N-bombs in trade chat, it's your job as a streamer to hide it, block it, or otherwise make sure it stops being broadcasted.
---
I can see how his fake cam could be distracting--that's completely valid--but it's not really wasted screen real estate, because that much of the screen will be obstructed regardless on Twitch.
---
Warlock also has the added bonus of not needing to respec out of their raid build for (anything but tryhard) PvP.
---
&gt; They do ok.
---
If half the single target DPS of a DPS class and 0 AoE damage means they do "ok" well...
---
&gt; Plus it is just a shackle for strat/scholo runs, which is extremely valuable.
---
Yeah, you need a lot of cc if it takes you twice as long to kill a mob.
---
You play a class in vanilla, not a spec.
---
But one is a straight line and one is curved?
---
Everything I’ve heard is they will be reset
---
Talking to other guilds in /1 was the best. I remember my guild telling people to stop getting distracted by general chat in Molten Core, since so many guilds were running it simultaneously and messing around in chat.
---
Since rogue doesn't really benefit from any other crafting profession, Engineering is a good use of 1/2 of your profession slots. The other one can be [any] moneymaker.
---
Wouldn't Reconning reset when you change weapons?
---
Best dps to complete the holy trinity? (Healer,tank,dps)
---
Good find! I hope you reported it :)
---
33 here, I still sit on my foot like I'm 12.
---
Hmm I'm not 100% sure, I don't feel like it did back before they made it an actual buff, back in the wild west of reck i feel like you could. Back when you manual counted the crits.
---
I might be wrong about 1.12
---
The best way is to level one class to 60 and play it. You will learn about your different matchups and what all the other classes are good at while mastering the class you chose to level. There is so much to being good at a class. Especially when you’re undergeared which you don’t get to experience from these instant 60 servers. Gold making, gear farming, pve roles, pvp roles, 1v1 matchups, consumables... all this you will only learn from playing the game on live servers and not in instant 60 servers simply because it is very hard to find someone who’s got BiS in every single slot.
---
This question is really backwards, you should be doing all the dungeons by default and asking which ones to skip.
---
Skip:
---
\- Ragefire
---
\- Wailing Caverns
---
\- Stockade
---
\- RFK
---
\- Sunken Temple
---
You have to manage your pet if you want max DPS. That means paying attention to the Melee and the Ranged calls. Pet control alone is probably harder than playing Mage in BWL lol.
---
Damn. Is gone. What'd it say?
---
You are deflecting.   Ask yourself why you want to play vanilla over bfa(if you do at all) and think about it logically.   We want to go back to when our actions mattered.   This is why people want vanilla wow - they want to feel like they can do things and it has some sort of impact on the in game world.   They like seeing other people on the server and knowing them.   BFA mechanics are not great, but they are fine... if none of these things bother you, you could play bfa and probably have an enjoyable experience since a server community does not matter to you.   That is why I'm confused why you would be opposed to no cross realm yet want to play vanilla, since you would probably have more fun or similar fun in retail wow.   One of the biggest reasons to go back to vanilla wow is the server community.   You should have an understanding why cross realm goes against that if you actually played vanilla before cross server.
---
It only negates the work if you fail to accrue emotional investment in your character as you take them through expansions.
---
The racials aren't so powerful that you should worry about it, just play whatever race you like.
---
That said, the only thing you really need to know is that if your a hybrid class (Shaman, Druid, Paladin) you're a healer in PvE content. There are exceptions to that rule, but that is the rule.
---
For this reason I prefer Shockadin. Max Spellpower. You can heal like a monster in PVP and every rogue that gets uppity gets a trinket enhanced shock/judgement combo. Ah, good times. You could even tank pretty decent with this build as you now have a ranged pull/taunt. Only think it fell flat was continued DPS, but this is where you just look for a DPS class to help out.
---
Didn't read. No amount of ranting is going to change the fact that animations are objectively a part of gameplay. You as a player control the way your character moves, what animations it performs. That is literally gameplay.
---
IIRC there was some weird dragon serpent thing that twink hunters used in the 20-29 (maybe) range and it was a monster.
---
Half of my friends were still using CRTs leading into TBC.
---
&gt; We want to go back to when our actions mattered. This is why people want vanilla wow - they want to feel like they can do things and it has some sort of impact on the in game world. They like seeing other people on the server and knowing them
---
Speak for yourself. I just liked the content. I never ever cared about the names of the opposite faction.
---
You can easily heal dungeons while leveling even if you’re enhancement. Just keep a few pieces of gear with intellect on it in your bank or bags and swap them when you wanna try some healing. I’ve leveled and ranked shaman in pservers so I certainly know a bit about it.
---
might need to read more slowly
---
Resto Shaman is by far the most in demand spec for 40 man raids because of the utility totems provide. It's optimal to take 7 or even 8 resto shaman in 40 man raids. Good guilds on private servers will message shaman in their 50s and invite them to the guild because they need more resto shamans for the totems, and carry them through dungeons to get them geared up fast.
---
Hey thanks man, I appreciate that (...although bro, what kind of taste in hockey teams is that!? How can you support both Sharks and Kings!? :P Kidding lol. I'm just a sour Calgary fan since I thought this was finally our year.)  
---
I would say that Warlock is still an awesome class to play casually. Which, I know doesn't necessarily help you, but it's worth mentioning. They've got all these epic class quests that really get you into the class. 
---
Ultimately while I'd say Druid is the ultimate casual class due to the variety and the niche role of flag carrying and the amount of lore in there, warlocks are a fairly close second. I hear you though, I'm going priest but it's gonna take all my strength not to roll Paladin since while I want to heal, I would like to think I have the option of tanking too (even though pallys basically don't, in vanilla). So I've got a similar thing going. 
---
Enjoy Classic dude, it's gonna be epic whichever of those classes you pick :)
---
Don't worry, a lot of those fears are unfounded. Warlocks do not feel like hunters. They feel much slower (no dash/move speed on pets, weaker pets, no move speed increases) but make up for it in insane utility that arguably beats out even hunters. They are also significantly more involved on grinding, since you aren't just hunters mark/sting/autoshot on every mob. You get to fear and drain tank, spam dots, life tap, drain soul, etc which IMO is a lot of fun since there's tons you can manage to maximize efficiency and really pull off some crazy situations. Soul shards are a thing, but they aren't that bad and shouldn't be a deal breaker, especially compared to hunters who have to deal with quivers/ammo.
---
If you don't like DS/ruin, go SM/ruin. Yeah, in raids you are still spamming shadowbolt, but you can very easily tweak the build a little and make it very decent in PvP while still being raid viable. Plus, it's heavier in affliction than it is destruction.
---
Priests are actually weirdly similar IMO. Both rely heavily on shadow damage dots, fear, and wanding; can handle multiple mobs with ease, and have zero downtime while grinding. Both are also fantastic in PvP, especially 1v1 world ganks. Paladins are not better healers, they have different specialities but priests are still the most flexible healers in the game by a wide margin. Not to mention, you said you were going horde, so it's a moot comparison; on horde side priests and almost inarguably the best healer. 
---
If you go priest, and want to do any PvP, I strongly recommend undead. Very much my personal opinion and there is nothing wrong with troll, but the PvE benefits of troll are pretty marginal, and touch of undeath/devouring plague/WotFS will straight win every single gank while leveling vs. someone around your level range. The single target damage and tankiness is something most people just aren't prepared for.
---
What is his twitch?
---
YES! It makes no sense hahaha
---
To me this is the "hill I'm willing to die on".   With xserver bgs, there is no authentic classic wow for me, period.   If they're put in, it's ruined and we lost an opportunity that I waited years for.   I am willing and going to post about this so blizzard eventually sees a post somewhere, reads it, and understands this perspective.
---
I was a career hemo rogue (orc) from 1.3 to mid-WotLK, even made Warlord.  So all my experience is from a stun-locking sub rogue perspective.
---
Warriors were a pain in the butt and one of my worst match-ups other than a really good hunter (luckily those were few).  You're going to be on your back-foot if they get the jump on you.  I would usually run away, re-stealth, then control the opening of the fight.  Switch MH poison to deadly, BTW off-hand poison was always the snaring one.  Open up with garotte, let deadly stack up, 5 point rupture and then dance between his melee and his charge range.  Hopefully you'll get a re-stealth but you'll be okay if just kite him to death.  Remember to stop attacking when the inevitable Retaliation goes off.  Also never use Evasion vs. a warrior.
---
I knew this was going to happen lol
---
You don’t NEED to go dwarf, unless you’re going to be a top hardcore raiding guild which by the sounds of it OP isn’t going to
---
If you really want to you can find a lot of guides on https://classic.wowhead.com/ and of course there are a million videos on Youtube.
---
He said 5 years from now though... I mean who knows. As long as it always give the priority to immersion and role play I feel arenas would be interesting in classic wow there are quite a lot of very powerful pvp specs, hybrid druid, smite priest, boomkin, shadow priest, warlock.. shaman elem and enh, and of course rogues! I would be supprised to only see wars and paladins to be honest.
---
Don't play what others tell you to, play what you think looks fun. 
---
Sure, Warriors are harder to level than other classes, but that shouldn't steer you away from the class. They're immensely fun to play. 
---
Priest are good too, great healers and they're stupidly strong as Shadow in PvP. 
---
I'd recommend trying out them a little once Classic is out, and see which one you enjoy the most. 
---
It really doesn't matter if you decide at level 20 you'd rather play Warrior and have to reroll, or vice-versa. 
---
People will feed you a lot regarding the best races for the specific class, they might have an advantage in one way or another but none of it is game-breaking and unless you're going for world-first kills, it honestly doesn't matter. 
---
Play what you want, if you don't know then try out some of the classes and get a feel for them.
---
Druids are great, just dont level up.
---
Sprint, evasion, gouge, and stealth all help a ton in leveling. Makes skipping useless mobs easy
---
My friends are rolling priest and tank Druid and I am torn between being a lock or mage. Why do you lean towards lock?
---
What is this supposed to mean?
---
25% stun resist is huge if you ever plan to pvp. No other racial beats that on shamans. None. Now if you are only gonna raidlog you might as well roll troll, assuming you will heal but let’s be real... what else would you do in raids? Be Nightfall bot if you’re lucky but that wouldn’t last long.
---
I'd read up on each of the classes and pick what sounds the most fun to you. Class identities in classic wow usually have some depth / flavor to them (via spells, quests, etc). The two classes I fell in love with in classic were Shaman (just a cool hero to play as, they have spells, heals, and they hit things hard with enchanted hammers/axes -- fuck yeah) and Warlock (summon demons, throw spells that damage enemies over time, have a wide range of extremely niche spells, and did I mention you summon demons?). 
---
All classes and most specs are viable and fun, just depends on what you're looking to play.
---
The only non-viable spec is Druid Moonkin, it's a meme build, it's fucking awful, but you spam Moonfire which is a pretty spell.
---
They've heard this argument. I heard it in many flavors in the Blizzcon Q&amp;A. Blizzard gets it and they don't care.
---
Die on the hill if you want. You and your ilk will be a drop in the bucket.
---
I mean, you have a lvl cap which means you can get all the gear you want without leveling + they respec for this effectively treating it as endgame, of course they will outperform a shitty pserver char in greens with no professions. 
---
The instance is tuned for leveling characters with no professions and shitty gear - albeit with higher level, not lvl 30 twinks with 225 engineering.
---
If you don't care about it, then you should be able to accept blizzard making a few servers with no cross realm since it does not effect you.
---
The fact August isn't now makes me hate all things
---
There’s a bunch of gnome, troggs, and trolls while leveling as gnome. You might have to grind a couple extra but isn’t too difficult.
---
its like the one racial that can really open doors for you
---
go dwarf priest if alliance
---
Rnk 14 is a grind fest. Has nothing to do with skill.
---
I sure hope you don't make a living in a technical field because I fear for the products you develop and your coworkers having to put up with you.
---
I think buff bots is what’s deteriating people away. I used to main a paladin in vanilla and raided up to naxx 3rd boss. I have no idea how I did it back then.
---
Learn it yourself
---
That sounds like a story from /r/wallstreetbets
---
Warrior/priest/mage is a better comp for pvp by far. You can tank just fine as feral, it's pretty damn boring though. Literally all you do is spam Swipe, nothing else (even single target tanking). And you stare at a big fat bear ass all day. Once you get BWL gear druid tanks get insane armour values and can soak damage better than warriors, due to boss mechanics though you wont MT much. Druid tank threat is the highest of the 3 tanks in vanilla due to the broken threat mechanics of Swipe.
---
Warrior is sooooo rewarding, just takes a little longer to farm mats, gear and level, but if you stick at it once you get geared my god you’ll feel like Jesus reincarnated walking around your factions city /flex ing at all the lower levels
---
Is your question "I have 3 friends and I want to DPS what's the best choice" or "which of the classes can do all 3" ? Because the answer to the 2nd question is druid, no other class can tank and heal at the same time.
---
Pretty sure human and nelf are the better priests late game AQ+ anyways
---
warrior is braindead easy to level, just make sure you keep a stack of food handy and level up First Aid because you WILL need it unless you're playing with a pocket healer.  If you have to tank at some point just tab target and apply sunders to everything and only blow rage on heroic strike/cleave if you have way too much rage coming in to spend otherwise.  Be sure and do your class trainer's quests, that's how you get stances.  
---
Priest is fine, level as shadow and if you need to heal a dungeon don't worry about it, back in vanilla everybody healed leveling dungeons as shadow spec.  
---
The gold standard go to recommendation for people who have no idea what they're doing is always beast mastery hunter.  The pet tanks for you and can be fairly durable, you can heal the pet, you can feign death to drop aggro if you pull too much, and generally a small child can easily level to 60 with it.
---
You can take the zeppelin from outside of Undercity to Orgrimmar, or vice versa. After that it's just a short run.
---
Awesome.  Can I do UD quests from level 1?
---
This post has earned my upvote
---
That's a pet from the [Wind Serpent](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=windserpent) family.
---
It won't be a unique build. Holy/Reckoning is a thing. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qodXtYwTZuo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qodXtYwTZuo)
---
1) Str/Int/Stam are bread an butter, which makes D1 set solid. Obviously spell damage helps so Rank 10 and T2 shine.  
---
2) It's just common sense based on what you have to work with. I think Blizzard wanted more for hybrids but didn't fine tune it enough uptfront, which is why you see gear start to get better itemization in ZG and get way better come AQ. They kept that trend going all the way into TBC to the point where hybrids really felt good.  
---
3) One build is fine. 25/26/0, 31/20/0, 20/31/0 will all cover Raids, PvP and Dungeons as healer or tank no problem.  
---
4)  I've actually never noticed before if you can get crit while blocking but I think you can still be? Either way you need as much mitigation as possible to live through building stacks in the first place. There's a lot of scenarios where you will be sitting at full stacks while chasing down someone just to get in range anyway.  
---
5) SoR scales with spell damage and the spell crit from intellect does affect it.  
---
6) Verigan's fist is worth when it becomes available unless you are super speed leveling or leveling with other people who don't want to spend time helping with it. T2 + [http://classicdb.ch/?item=19360](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19360) is all you really need in life, so unless you really want to do the pvp grind I wouldn't bother past Rank 11.
---
What’s the deal with normalized weapon speed?
---
I used to run in a group as the enchanter. In instances, we would need or pass, allowing me to DE the BOP drop and then give the mats to the highest roller. Most times, the mats were worth more (on the AH) than just vendoring the blue.
---
Yes, easily, and at 60 they're one of the most sought after healers in the game.
---
You don't need to, but just wait and see how people are going to recruit for raids. Let's be honest, any dwarf priest will be picked over you every day of the week. It's literally the best race/class combination in the game. So if you are a casual and actually want a chance to raid someday you will get prioritized over better players than you just because you ll be a dwarf.
---
I was just out of college.  I had a job and a girlfriend, but she was in med school.  What that meant was that I got to immerse myself fully in everything classic WoW.  Diablo 2 was amazing and I didn't think anything would ever top it.  WoW was something else entirely.  I don't think I'll ever feel that gaming high again.
---
Reset, beta has never carried over before why would it now?
---
Starting zones are interchangeable so yes :)
---
Washed up? Damn you guys are slow.
---
Awww, someone seems butthurt about being proven wrong.
---
Excellent to hear :D ty
---
healing is about all shamans were good for in vanilla pve.  Wear intellect gear.  Press the heal button.  Drop totems a lot.  Bring water.
---
Keep in mind, in all the docks you listed the ships pulled up perpendicular to the short docks. In Auberdine, the boats moor parallel to the longest part of the docks, on the branching smaller docks that run 90 degrees from the longest section. This allows the ships plenty of room to pull alongside until reaching their respective smaller docks. It makes sense to me, although it could just be accidental in design.
---
In game sounds and whatever earrape my discord randomly throws at me
---
Knowing the fights, have 0 downtime during Bosses. Re position smartly so you dont have to run for long therefor missing dps. Decursing, Knowing what spell to use when. (Hint. Its Frostbolt)
---
Missing 3 times in a row.
---
You didn't prove anything.  You're just stating what you believe to be objective facts, and you didn't even read the stuff I wrote which explains the technical reasons why animations are arbitrary in this game.
---
Coming from a quality of life perspective while leveling, I'd say your best bets are either Mage (food, water, sheep, portals) or Warlock (healthstone, soulstone, summoning). But every class has its own unique advantages.
---
Why would you skip ragefire and stockades? Yeah the gear is not good but it's a whole level of XP and they are both fast and easy.
---
Skip WC if you are Alliance but Horde gets the quest for the staff which is the best 2H weapon for 10 levels for any class that can equip it.
---
ST and RFK are hot garbage at their level.
---
WoW's art teams have always produced stellar work. BfA gets a lot of hate, but have you sat down and listened to the soundtrack? The artists Blizz hires for their games are all incredibly talented.
---
Good placement of the protection stance. Cause you rarely use it as fury.. and its in an awkward position
---
&gt; And how satisfying was it to see him prove all the anti-ret guys in the comments wrong?
---
Didn't watch but thought he was ret because of that. I guess that dude didn't watch it either lol
---
Mobs don't care about doors, they'll just run through. Even if the evade bug you can do on private servers work, I doubt they could kill Archaedas himself. He's a level 47 elite and hits hard.
---
August 31st, new Tool album. All set. Mainly though I really like the in game music. if not that then The Mad Max Fury Road soundtrack fits so well!
---
I don't care if Blizzard does it, I just understand why they never will.
---
It doesn't matter. If you're within 1% and the boss does an aggro dump, an unlucky crit could put you above the OT, causing the boss to aggro you and not the OT. Then even if you FD, positioning is fucked up and people start dying.
---
Side note, your courtesy in this thread is a breath of fresh air!
---
The rest of the comments already hit the major points. Keybinding is just whatever helps you reduce the friction between "I want to do X" &amp; actually doing X. There are no hard rules, but here's the guidelines ([or in video form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38s7e1sixRk&amp;list=PL0j3zibAlFDtCF-1pIYRg9VYURY2bbLJh&amp;index=2))
---
*Prioritize what you bind. Stuff like interrupts thrive off fast-reactions, so give them good real estate like Q or R. Buffs like arcane intellect, on the other hand, don't really need to be bound at all, that'd be more hassle than its worth. And spells like shadowbolt that I spam nonstop - mousewheel is as convenient as can be for that.  
---
*Take it slow. Trying to bind everything from the start will frustrate you. Start with a few binds until you get your muscle memory, then do a few more.  
---
*Consistency helps learning. If you're trying to play multiple characters, having similar keybinds is incredible.  
---
*Plan it out, and then test it out. See what abilities you want to have bound &amp; what's in comfortable reach for you. If [shift] or [ctrl] or [alt] are convenient, they effectively multiply your potential keybinds. But remember, you don't need everything bound
---
i doubt a mana burn or 5% spirit is ever considered better than fear prevention
---
haha this makes me so happy.
---
I would just be careful of what class you pick, if you’re planning on going hunter/shaman you’re not gonna have a class trainer in UD starting zones.
---
Nice!
---
I would love to buy one 👍
---
Players are just way better now.
---
You stable your main pet, go out and train for new skills, dump that pet, get your main pet back from stable and train it.
---
31, 6'2" dude... Always have my left leg tucked under my right at work, figure four style. I sleep that way too. I'm just odd lol.
---
just like they would never do vanilla.
---
Just keep in mind that if you're playing a Class which Undead can't be, there won't be any trainers for you in the starting zone.
---
Hell yes. I leveled my Shaman from 1-60 as Elemental, which was good but never blew anyone's socks off. PvP was fun with the right crits. This is testing my memory but I think, like boomkin, the issue was not so much the damage but being able to *sustain* it. Resto was okay, but we mainly got into raids for Mana Tide even though it was average at best. I forget when exactly but it wasn't until one of the expacs, I want to say WotLK, that Shaman healing really felt great.
---
After BWL, your mages should all be fire and working together to keep ignite rolling. It's what I loved about mage, you actually had to work together. Scorch weaving was definitely a learned skill.
---
It really depends. If you like old school games then it's great for you. If you are more into fast paced action that modern games offer then you might feel bored of how slow game Classic is.
---
But I still highly recommend trying it. You don't need to buy anything, you just need subscription. So when it launches, buy that one month (12$) and try it out!
---
Pets don't need rage.
---
I played a shadow priest in vanilla WoW and had a blast. Yes you will be asked to heal in raids, but raids aren't everything. Shadow priests are top tier in pvp.
---
Mage. Undead or gnome.
---
I personally do not enjoy playing mage, however the skill ceiling might be the highest of any class. Played perfectly a mage can fight multiple players, but you have to be insanely good.
---
New sub sound?
---
Hitting your Frostbolt keybind faster than the other mages and having better gear. EZ
---
They furnish the snacks
---
Preach yells too much.
---
Again that’s onnit.com, O N N I T .com
---
Just google wow classic discord
---
Blizzard's goal with Classic is to cast ONE big net and capture as many nostalgic players as they can. They're not looking to make everyone happy. It's impossible.
---
It's the same reason they have no plans for RP-PVP servers. Too many nets is too much development costs and Blizzard has made it clear they don't plan on spending any more money or time on Classic than necessary.
---
What do you mean by "tracked"? Someone is currently working on porting it?
---
Lol no I will have more time. 
---
First year university forced me to take a break from classic. 
---
It was brutal. 
---
After that the German and French provider gave me 5000 ping for 2-3 months.
---
Took a second break. 
---
I can finally enjoy the game fully, without rushing, because I'm not on a break 50% of the time.

!RemindMe 2 weeks
---
Uh.... k. 
---
This is false.
---
The 8.1 client has multi-threading support, the Classic client does not.
---
Blizzard has stated time and again that Classic is based on a fork of the 7.3.5 client.
---
[This](https://willitclassic.com/view/X54oOK0a0P1v8mSIpwLA) does really concern me. Have they actually managed to get LFR add on to work with Classic even Blizzard did say they want to block some parts of API so no group finding tools should be possible. If it works I hope changes will be made.
---
Haha, I suppose none of you were planning on shaman then.

---
It was an arcade standard
---
my semester starts about two weeks prior to release, so the homework should really start becoming steady about when launch happens. gg. looks like my all nighters will be spent before launch trying to get as far ahead in class as possible so that i may have some nights off to level.
---
That is a BfA mechanic not something that was even a conception during the time of Classic. In classic the factions are at an uneasy ceasefire which means they are not technically at war. In BfA they are at war but not so in Classic. A ceasefire agreement is a stoppage of war for a period of time. It is not normally a complete end of war but can lead to it.
---
The metric for what makes an "updated" addon seems to be pretty low. For instance, Tukui is in this category, but the repo for his plans for Classic is very unfinished. It can't be used right now in any capacity. So far, all he's done is announce plans to have something ready by launch.
---
Keeping track.
---
The Blue and Orange are being worked on or will be.

Wasnt it 525 for dk tanks in wotlk?

Should have told us your classes for better advice.

This guy was by far the best I've seen. His rotation and situational awareness really shows in his tactical decisions.
---
Highest might be an overstatement.    
---
Warlocks have much more useful pets.    
---
Warriors have a lot of nuance in rage management, procs, stance dance.
---
Oh. My. God. I hated stance dancing enough to actually not roll warrior again this time around. But if I had this... I already use a foot pedal for my PTT key. A set for my left foot wouldnt be all that bad.
---
Everything thing above is true. 
---
Step 1.) Go arms, use the slowest (&gt;3.0 swing time) 2 handed weapon you can find 
---
Step 2.) spam health potions for days
---
Step 3.) profit
---
i don't think so.  the game came out in 2004, that was a really different time for pc gaming.  Expectations of what a game could get away with were a lot different.  The game really doesn't respect your time at all, stuff like having to sit around spamming chat to get into dungeon groups, ridiculously bad drop rates for quest items (hello mulgore and barrens), super unbalanced starting areas (elwyn vs mulgore, yikes), poor flow of quests, lots of recovery time between mobs while just questing, 30 minute runs between towns in some zones (ashenvale)...
---
My guess is the game would feel very tedious if you don't have a lot of nostalgia to fall back on.  I basically did nothing but this thing for about two years straight in college days and it still feels really irritating sometimes in beta seeing all these antiquated systems.  Game design has kinda moved on in the last decade.  At the time it was this crazy, magical thing, but there's a good chance you've played better games than this by now.
---
I have personally tested this, and taking an orc to the undead zone is actually pretty simple.
---
After you make your character, run immediately east until you leave the Valley of Trials. Follow the road straight east until you see the first quest giver. Accept his quest (I forget the name) then run straight north along the road until you get to Razor Hill. There, turn in the quest and accept food if you are melee or water if you are a caster. Continue running north on the path until the gates of Orgrimmar, then head east to the zeppelin tower. The southern zeppelin will bring you to Tirisfal Glades -- it takes about 3 minutes for a round trip if you miss it. Once you the zeppelin loads into Eastern Kingdoms, I recommend jumping off the zeppellin and falling to your death on the earliest beach possible; from there you can spirit rez in Deathknell next to your wife. You should be able to do nearly every quest in Tirisfal Glades with one or two exceptions (A New Plague and possibly the very first quest).
---
Or maybe not be so dead set on forcing a square object into a round hole?
---
TBC the good:
---
\- arenas
---
\- heroic mode dungeons
---
\- prot paladin rework
---
\- hunter rework
---
\- Gruul's Lair
---
\- Zul Aman
---
\- Black Temple
---
\- Shaman/Paladins available to both factions
---
\- Blood elves (I personally didn't like them, but 80% of the people who play seems to like them so I'm counting it as a win)
---
TBC the bad:
---
\- flying mounts ruined world pvp and immersion
---
\- Orcs in space theme was bad
---
\- Lots of lame raids full of sooooooo much trash
---
\- Draenai 
---
I would like to see them add content but keep the level cap at 60 after vanilla has run it's course. It might be interesting to do most of the TBC class fixes and allow players to earn 10 extra talent points but stay lvl 60.

https://classicdb.ch/?quest=14
---
its a 3 part quest, harder than i thought tbh, if your solo crafting the wand may be easier at lv11 as you'd prob want to be 14/15ish to solo it.
---
Still would have been better with a prot/holy paly and 3 hunters instead
---
Are... Are you him? He really doesn't look above average skill.
---
I definitely agree with the use of the cam to cover chat, and I'm fine with chat being covered. 
---
I guess saying lost real-estate isn't really fair because it's already used on chat but I'd prefer something not-animated block it if it's not a cam.
---
Again, that's just me and it won't stop me watching MadSeason when I can because of course I will, man doesn't clickbait, overhype or yell, he's just the kind of oldschool player you could chill with and just chat to. It's refreshing
---
It's not erroneously undertuned, it's just not that hard.  Yuge difference
---
Have you considered a gaming mouse? I have a razer naga and I love it.
---
I still had a massive one that felt like it weighed a hundred pounds. A lot of people I knew also had them, at least in '04 anyway. I didn't get rid of mine until my house burned down taking it out in a blaze of glory lol.
---
I don't have a problem with it per se, I know its required. What I don't like is how easily abusable it is
---
Soz good point.  Post edited with classes!
---
I use them in retail for group finder/dungeon journal/collections.
---
yeah for some reason I thought the wand was from the first part but its the 3 part of the chain which would be hard solo at that level.
---
Who?
---
I hope they do block LF anythiny, they said during blizzcon that addons will be very limited.
---
I genuinely don't understand the comments in the thread. I'm laughing my ass off that it somehow became a political issue :joy:
---
it was like that in vanilla.  even in vanilla beta the class forums were full of math-laden theorycraft threads about what would work best and why it would work best.  If you were raiding past MC and not following the meta for your class frankly you were dragging your team down a bit.  It wasn't some utopia of blissful ignorance.  We had resources and expectations and some things worked way better than others. 
---
One of the most popular fan sites you may remember was called Elitist Jerks, that was not a completely tongue in cheek name...
---
Yea, but he wasn't adding any real dps.
---
Would have been better off with casting gear and 3 hunters kiting instead of the warrior who didn't tank much
---
Depends. If you grind to r14 with a premade and be spammed with libs and such, EA will matter less. The weapon skill matters in pve. Up to you to determine which one is prio for you.
---
Pretty much both. For couple expansions they have limited flying at start of expansion and only make it possible towards end of expansion. I have definitely felt being in living world more and I've had couple nice interactions with people as well.
---
But sure dungeon finder is really bad addition as well. Most of groups are just listed "know what to do" and then they check your dungeon score and invite you. And only thing you hear is "hi" at start  and "thanks bye" at end.
---
For me personally actual combat in Classic is not too shiny. But real reason why I am so hyped is that I want to feel like I'm in community again. People talkin each others while questing and doing dungeons.
---
This is the correct answer. SM/ruin is just a great spec, and very viable in both PvP and pve.
---
If you are doing solely group PvP, some holy priest builds are also very strong in both; but those are the only stand out specs I can think of.
---
have you taken a technical writing course?
---
I did exactly this - bought one on amazon for my vent bind.  Broke in 2 raids.  It worked well enough for those 2 raids though.
---
This entire month has felt like a nostalgia overload with all these vanilla songs coming out of the woodwork the shits hilarious and much appreciated. I've literally remembered the end of this song since the inception of the video for literally no reason at all and now my brain can finally let it go and move on, take this upvote and just go already!
---
Clearly fake news, as if anyone even logged in during the stress test
---
I'm 6'2" and do this all the time. No need to be small. It's so comfy!
---
no. is it that bad? :(
---
Yep, this happened. I was in NA as a healy Shaman at the time. Was drama llama. Though any of my old Smolderthornions remember when Daedel sold his main tank account from Epic, lulz.
---
every question about mankrik's wife or whatever was immediately answered with "go look it up on thottbot" or similar.  If you didn't know what thottbot was after a week or two you just weren't looking at the screen.
---
Not an overstatement at all. Players of other classes tend to have no idea of how hunters are played, which is probably why you assume they must be easy to master because they are easy to pick up. Their rotation is simply harder to perform than any other classes, and being a top tier hunter simply requires more skill and tactical thinking than most of the classes.
---
&gt;Warlocks have much more useful pets.
---
I don't see why you would think this. Warlocks pets are terrible at tanking because the warlock has trouble keeping them alive, they deal less damage than Hunter pets can, they deal less interrupts per second to spellcasters, they have significantly less abilities, and you can not rank up their armor or resistances.
---
Warlock pets are absolutely terrible in comparison to Hunter pets and by far their best use is killing them so you can get a damage absorption shield for yourself. While they are alive they aren't great.
---
&gt;Warriors have a lot of nuance in rage management, procs, stance dance.
---
I used to main warrior at first, for a couple years. I can say from experience it is far easier to master than hunter, but it's also not one of the simpler classes.
---
not at all I was gonna compliment your clear and concise direction-giving!
---
They're all in BiS level 30 gear. Probably better than what most would have at lvl 40.
---
Mod UI please!!!
---
That’s a good guild
---
At one point in the barrens there’s a quest where you kill a bunch of centaurs outside a bunker until a named one shows up. I remember 13 year old me thought that was the coolest thing ever.
---
Hunters would kite and swap agro with fain and distracting.
---
Esfand wasn't doing any real DPS, so he should have been in Int gear to heal more, his dps would probably have stayed the same.
---
Leveling professions vs lvl 60 professions. Skinning to sell to vendor and mining to send to a bank alt to save until I hit 60 and then level engineering is what I plan to do.
---
You should probably expect it not to happen.

# **&lt;Monolith&gt;** [US][PvP][Horde] Semi-Hardcore Raiding and PvP
---
\_\_\*\*Raid information\*\*\_\_
---
Schedule: Tuesday and Thursday 20:15-00:15 CST (Primary Raid Days)
---
Sunday 20:15-0015 CST (20-man and Onyxia if necessary)
---
Loot system: Our loot system will be determined utilizing the opinions of all members when we get closer to that time. We want to use a system that is both fair but also doesn't discourage minor upgrades in favor of "hording" points for that one item everyone really wants.
---
\_\_\*\*What you can expect from our team\*\*\_\_
---
We are a mature group with a lot of history in the game. We intend to progress consistently and quickly without requiring anyone to sink endless hours into raiding. Content will be done in a timely manner. Other than that, play and have a good time.
---
\_\_\*\*What we expect from you\*\*\_\_
---
We're looking for players that can commit to the planned raid schedule. We will not have a "one and done" mindset in regards to missing a raid. But no less than 90% attendance is very much encouraged. And we don't just need a warm body to fill a slot on the roster. We need detail oriented players with situational awareness. And of course, someone that can work and play with a team. We don't just want people that will log in to raid and then be done. We want a community of players that get along both during a raid as well as after.
---
\_\_\*\*How to join\*\*\_\_

Please follow the link below to join our Discord where you will be presented with a link to our brief application. Once that's completed, you will be contacted by an officer.

I would check less often for your sanity but I believe some more will come out in batches. If you haven’t ever played hearthstone give it a try!
---
Consumables
---
Hah this is fantastic thank you kindly :)
---
I'd get repentance over divine favor. It's a gap closer, a cc to buy time to heal, and another way to amplify your SoC judgement damage.
---
Wowhead actually has just what you need :) The made a classic version of their site and it has a dressing room tool that you can use check armor and weapons on all races. 
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room)
---
I can repro this by putting pet on passive, body pulling a mob and then issuing /petattack. Pet is OK if I pull by shooting. This was before autoshot broke.
---
An efficient Horde wand is avail at the wand vendor in Org. Level 10 I believe.
---
I think its ridiculous to expect those changes tbh, so agree to disagree.
---
It's a troll, it's an unchanged BfA addon except name.
---
That doesn’t mean that they don’t have skill, it means they could have no skill.
---
I’d make the argument if you do something so much everyday you might be better than the average player in pvp.
---
Clearly you don’t agree and think this guys shit.
---
Still, I haven’t gotten an alternative from anyone here as to someone who’s better.
---
But if you want to just be negative that’s okay too.
---
I'm going to give an alternate opinion and say that Wailing Caverns and Deadmines are great to run. It's very easy to grab quests for these two dungeons that make it very worth your time. Especially because it's difficult to obtain blues any other way at this level, and blues really do make a difference in leveling. 
---
Recommended level for both, at least 17 or 18.
---
I've played both since vanilla, they've always been my two mains. You really cannot go wrong with either. Just determine of you want to heal or dps, then your choice is easy. And realistically with the game remaining for years and years, just play both :) That's my plan anyway. Swapping priest first this time.
---
9% hit
---
it gets parried
---
You do know Vanilla had 100% always pvp right?
---
I’m not him lol.
---
I totally regret doing this, there’s some absolute legends in here who are all clearly better than this guy.
---
spirit was always just take it where it comes and don't worry about it.  it's like on live how nobody really worries much about their 3rd best stat, you get the stuff that has your best stats and the rest falls where it may.  So in this case you want Hit and shadow damage and crit and if an item also has some stamina or spirit then that's not really a concern.
---
I wouldn't worry. Ion did say that if someone would manage to make it they would block it.
---
If its here now it's good, because they'll get rid of it for launch
---
There are no perfect systems but Loot Council guarantees that progression is the main focus of the guild.
---
Prioritizing who gets loot increases your ability to access and defeat more content.
---
DKP, which in theory is that fairest of the systems, can be abused and sometimes leads to disenchanting loot because everyone is saving their points, it favors mediocrity rather than needs for the guild and creates unnecessary and uncomfortable situations when it involves bidding for equipment that is used by your off spec.
---
Damn this is some quality art!
---
Priest is not a shaman now is it?
---
How is scorch weaving a learned skill? Don’t you just have a timer for when it’s going to run out and just cast it again?
---
What about holy priest? i know there flash of light crit spammers in raids i just didnt know opinions on how they are pvp wise
---
sorry holy pally
---
His "Last Man Standing" song is one of my favorites. I still have it on playlist I listen to today.
---
it's okay they can have their moment of having no fucking clue it's kinda funny
---
31 20 holy paladin as always.
---
Because it's not possible for one mage to keep scorch and ignite rolling. You have to coordinate. You *could* just have one mage stuck on scorch duty, but that's not the best way.
---
Ah I was thinking about the hidden boss
---
Would you mind going into further detail about why the slowest possible weapon is best? 
---
Wouldn’t a faster weapon generate more rage and allow for bigger pulls?
---
Late game there are no significant fear mechanisms
---
Lol paladins don't have that though.
---
they may do another wave but the last wave for closed beta was before stress test
---
Unfortunately all streamers have been invited so they arent going to bother with more "waves of invites".
---
Work ahead so you can play video Games... I like your style
---
His 12-30 alliance guide is not very good though (speedwise). So I wouldn't count on the rest. I tried it 2 times on the beta. If you're just looking for a guide that takes you by the hand, it's fine.
---
YIKES
---
lets hope all the dwarf priests in good raids early game burn out then so there is room for the shit races
---
I know, I played on one however story wise you are still not at war. Doesn't matter that the mechanics allow you to attack the other faction.
---
I want the add-on that would play a sound effect when you crit or got a killing blow, I liked using HEADSHOT from unreal tournament lol the classic
---
Abilities like mortal strike do weapon damage, which means you want a weapon with higher top-end damage. Keeping dps constant, a slower weapon will have higher top end damage.
---
70% of players won’t hit level 40, retail will do just fine. as sad as it is

the shittier raiding guilds are the ones that NEED that dwarf priest applicant.  The top guilds already have people doing that.
---
Best comment ever
---
They usually do
---
This is almost certainly intended. It isn't counting mob fanning as chase distance so that simple mob fanning wouldn't accidentally trigger leashing.
---
And for anyone thinking that circumventing mob leashing in and of itself is anything resembling a problem, in old wow leash distance reset any time a mob was hit, so you could avoid mob leashing anyway.
---
Always a toss up for me between Female Orc and Female Troll.
---
Female Orc has superior casting and weapon animations.
---
Female Trolls have superior posture, are sleeker, and are more aesthetically pleasing to me.
---
yikes
---
arguably a marginal win for human at that stage yea.  you have to do MC and Ony and BWL to get there though.
---
Don’t forget to bind Shift + Spacebar to something. It’s real convenient
---
The only major difference is that your pet is useless in raids and thus, so is your damage output.
---
Level a druid. That way you get to play a rogue a warrior a priest and a mage! You can’t lose!!
---
The 8.1 client does, the 8.0.1 client did not. 
---
While the Blizzcon build was a fork on 7.3.5 according to both the Blizzcon presentation and what we could check from the Blizzcon build. The last info we had from [Wowhead user TOMRUS](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291275.2/classic-beta-entry-appears-in-blizzards-cdn#p4341250) was that the database files for the beta were updated to a format consistent with 8.0.1.
---
I don't think they have an intention of forking and old version and leaving it to rot, that's the whole reason they aren't using the old client after all.
---
Protection. And sanctuary was instrumental for them keeping a good pace.
---
The problem with that is where they'd set line.
---
Is it as important before you hit 40?
---
I feel like getting whirlwind sword instead of the axe, partly because I like it and partly because everyone gets the axe. I feel like I can use the weapon speed rage bonus to my advantage from 30-40 by pulling multiple mobs and using sweeping strikes procs on cleave and whirlwind.
---
PS if I’m being ignorant it’s because I am new
---
Oh hey thats pretty cool I didn't realize wowhead had that much functionality. Thanks!
---
I don't think anyone is saying they are better. I've only ever had a 19 rogue twink. It's not even that he's had. It's just that, if you say some guy is the best ever, his highlights should show some actual impressive play.
---
They're not using the old client because they don't have the server infrastructure that's compatible. All their current server infrastructure is compatible with 7.3.5.
---
It literally says Legion PTR when you boot up the Classic Beta. We're still on 7.X.
---
Ah ok.  You’re already a bit used to the tedium but leveling prof even in BC was SO much easier.  Vanilla warrior leveling is a lot of sitting around eating.  Befriend a mage!
---
Any word on bartender? My favourite action bars by a mile.
---
Asmongold the warrior and Esfand the paladin are the core of that group (both popular streamers). So while your right, the comp is built around those two.
---
Its definitely interesting, but I don't want that on release. Maybe some weird server with a different level cap? I'm sure some people would play on it. 
---
The reason why it wouldn't work and doesn't really work is because the game is balanced around level 60. Usually at every 10th level classes get something big, and that big thing is sometimes a game changer.
---
Travel form for instance makes Druids crazy powerful in a 30 cap WSG match because no one can keep up. Warriors are strong because Whirlwind Axe is crazy good for a level 30 cap environment. Some classes will just be busted at different caps. 
---
I think its fun for the beta. I'd like to see them increase the cap to 40 just to see what changes would happen to the meta. But I definitely don't want it on live servers. 
---
There are tons of people who all they want to do is get to 60 and raid as fast as possible. To tell them that they don't get to do that for weeks is just a really bad idea. I'm not the fastest leveler of all time, but I definitely I'm 90% of my interest in this game is raiding. 
---
To not be able to even begin to gear up for that for weeks would piss me off
---
Give this man some upvotes!!!!
---
I'm going mage first so I can funnel gold to my alts
---
Interpol, Beck, Modest Mouse, The Decemberists and Iron and Wine are gonna be the biggest ones. 
---
I might reach into the sort of guilty pleasure / why did i listen to them back then vault and pull out some Amberlin / Bayside.
---
How in the world do you go from "Popular Streamer plays a Closed Beta of our Highly Anticipated Game" to "Fewer People Will Play Classic Because They Watched a Stream"?
---
Yeah I think he was definitely my pick for best in vanilla.
---
Others come to mind, grim, happyminti, Ming, eviscerate, but Niar would be mine.
---
I played rogue at 60 and it was hard to do what he did to the level he did back then.
---
This was about 12 years ago, so it’s a bit like watching old football highlights and comparing to today.

what level is scarlet monastery typically cleared in vanilla?
---
If you're going for tanky, you're missing out by not grabbing the two talents that activate if you get crit, in the fury tree. If you're tanking and get that 12% heal it will help, and the that generation from the next talent. You'll be fine with 1 point into imp battle shout, and the last point on that line should be howl, as slowing enemies will be a big deal for tanking aspect.
---
Also, personally in arms tree I'd take both talents on the first line and skip the 2nd line. 
---
Just my thoughts.
---
Huh, makes me wonder if I can set up my midi keyboard to play wow, or better yet, my electronic drum set.
---
If you're leveling arms warrior remember to only use axes at higher levels as it synergises the most with arms.
---
Took me maybe 1 hour to get my first wand. Farming mats, lvling tailorinh and ench.
---
On my warrior I use QERTFGC+shift/ctrl modifiers, and have 123 bound as stances. This is enough binds for every ability I use, plus pots/healthstone/macros.
---
If Wowhead won't do, here's an upload of the Vanilla Model Viewer: https://www.lonebullet.com/models/download-wow-model-viewer-v048e-world-of-warcraft-model-free-253.htm

*Elon dabs in the background*
---
Mage is probably the best answer
---
I think it lasted through TBC
---
Awesome thanks I'll give both a try and see which is easier to use. thanks!
---
mana tide totem the only most important thing for a shaman healer. fuck you people are funny
---
After a while imagine what this guy will do sitting at a table for dinner and you yell Spell Reflect!
---
tbf it only came out in EU in 2005. also why people look at the release date solely? like vanilla was 1 day only. 23 in novemeber 2004. nice logic
---
They delete everything
---
Big brain trolling.
---
I’m there :]
---
at low levels?  gear.  That and being better at ABC (Always Be Casting!).  Also stuff like fitting in a fireblast near the end of a mob's hp when you wouldn't get a full fireball cast off, or same deal with cone of cold.  Other than that be on the ball with polymorph if your group is using CC and don't stand in shit.  
---
In raids it's pretty much just who gets more spells out during the fight by being smart about movement.  Basic playing a caster in wow 101 stuff.  That and removing curses on some fights, that's actually important in vanilla raiding.  Bad mages don't decurse.
---
Well what is shows is that challenging content can be a lot of fun, and it doesn't have to be advanced raid mechanics like in retail. Unfortunately though, there will be no reason to do something like this on release and same-level content will be fairly easy for today's average player.
---
Just make sure to run some sort of scan on it. I downloaded it in a VM and looked at the files. It resembled what I remembered so I tossed the link up. Probably fine, but I don't want to be the reason your machine blows up.
---
join the Classic WoW Guilds Discord: [https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq](https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq) and find yourself a guild or just hang out in the discord itself.
---
I've seen many posts like yours and they all make me curious. Would you mind explaining what you like about the SP playstyle?
---
If you can't heal a dungeon without the 1200 mana from mana tide you are objectively terrible.
---
My guess (and plan) is to stop checking after may 30 - I don't see why they would invite anyone after that.
---
 Nowhere is safe for Tipsout aka "one of best warrior duelers in NA" aka "desolace is remake of amazon forest" aka "will of the forsaken breaks sheep".
---
That’s awesome buddy! When WoW releases I’m planning to make my fortune by cornering the deviate delight market early on, and you’ve made me even more excited for that!
---
There's a lot of differences. No kill command, no misdirect, no aspect of the viper, no steady shot, no ferocious inspiration, no expose weakness. Oh and your pet gets 0 scaling and no aoe reduction so is basically useless in raids.
---
Hahah, he is obviously trolling. And you think he is the idiot! Hilarious you salty baby
---
Early as 11 for Alliance. I think I can survive the the 5-11 journey without a wand.
---
Thx for the info my dude
---
+sword spec +lifestealing enchant on mh +shadow oil.. +gloves that do fire or nature omg. if +spell dmg scales with them that would be interesting haha
---
You will have to curse, sometimes corruption, shadowbolt and lifetap.
---
More than most classes have to
---
If you want complex raiding class go hunter. Hunters have to time their shots to maximize dps and also to control their pets.
---
Sodapoppin although a mainstream streamer is one of the most genuine guys you will ever watch
---
No love for Flurry Axe? =/
---
If this is true lets just say if its possible to clear, they will do it.
---
Sword spec horde rogues wet dream
---
Tenker dere å samle så mange som mulig på en server også? Så vi får en giga norsk server, uavhengig av faction!
---
You'd be lucky to have three blues and green shoulders at that point through normal leveling.
---
I dont know of a 32, but look at Acer ed347ckr for value possibly.
---
Hahahah! I love it!
---
I had CRTs when WoW first came out. It was heavy too.
---
First char was a lock and after 15 years I can tell you it learned me the game raison right. I eventually switched to Hpriest cause I wanted to heal people but Locks are awesome at PvP, Grind very well, you have to farm shards, Cloth is also another reality check on how squishy you are and puts things in perspective, and you learn what is utility and also social in Vanilla since you're very useful. That's why I played Priest, wanted more of this side.
---
As a Jack of all trade, you will either fall in love with it or It will make you choose, going lock is a very good "I do not know" choice.
---
People of opposite faction gathered together?
---
lol 60 dungeons true. but if you think you are going to be a raid healer without mana tide totem...
---
He copied and pasted that reply about 7 times in a row. Has to be trolling..
---
Flask every raid and you'll be top dog.
---
It wasn't an auto grouping addon, but I remember in vanilla there was an addon that would basically filter out messages in LFG or Trade and sort them by dungeon.  Would that be frowned upon?
---
maybe if he wasnt trying to carry his scum ass roommate then they would have done better.
---
r/woweconomy
---
Yeah, up until 60, just whatever has more "Warrior" stats, don't worry about difference between DPS and tanking.
---
At 60, you'll start to consider how different items affect your ability to do more DPS or better mitigate damage. I suggest reading some guides for pre-raid Best in Slot DPS and Tanking gear to give you a better idea of what is expected from either role.
---
Go troll priest, you'll have fun!
---
Bingo
---
Ohh boii ! Great idea !
---
Played a warlock for a year. Not once had healers or mages ask for healthstone (especially giving out such a cocky reasoning).
---
That's a good comparison. The skill ceiling has increased quite a bit over the years.
---
I'd consider Perplexity among the best rogues right now and he for sure will be playing.
---
https://youtu.be/I-kYglKZ1f8
---
If you would not mind here are 2 questions i would like to hear solved from classic if possible. :)
---
Blessing of Kings: Does it increase stats only from gear &amp; base value or does it also increase stats gained through other buffs.
---
Blessing of Salvation: If cast upon a warlock using searing pain, will it then instead of 200% threat do 170% threat or 140% threat ? the question is where does it get placed into the equation, before cast or after impact.
---
This is the single best tip. Buying a mouse with 12 buttons right on it. Add shift, and control versions and you have 36 keybinds. It seems like a lot, but you build muscle memory quickly and van beat on some ass.
---
Do you know  spots for rogue?
---
As good as this seems, on pservers you are better off with anubisath or better off hand to thrash.
---
6) You want (and are abele) to have it at level 20
---
People just watch clips and are ignorant of the "30 meta". Everyone in that 5man has BIS gear for a level 30, tons of different pots, and coordination.
---
Completely fucking different than Joe Shmoes nostalgic first SM run where he didnt know amyone, had maybe 3 blues and a couple of lesser healing potions, jacked up talents, and on their 5th wipe.
---
Honestly something like this should be fine. As long as it's not automatic grouping and no cross realm its heaps better than retail
---
This kinda makes you wonder... if the numbers are somehow wrong?Should something like this even be possible on a real 1.12?
---
That's not what he was asking about no. Literally no one was taking about raids. Maybe read the post before you start having a mental break down and start screaming.
---
some people use separate keys for warrior stances?  
---
interesting people
---
Shadowpriest sucks in premate srs premate wont even inv you.
---
Haha, Sacramento Kings, man. I’d never root for an LA team! 
---
I’ll probably end up playing a bit of both, tbh, at least to start. It’ll take me twice as long to make progress but I’ll get to enjoy everything that way. I’m glad I never really played either class much (except a bear tank I leveled exclusively through dungeon finder to like 45, which doesn’t really count) so it gives me an opportunity to try something new in classic. It should make it that much more of a fresh experience! Super excited. 
---
Not sure if you’ve played a priest before, but I had a lot of fun healing with one. Probably even more so than on my paladin, although I’m still partial to him because he was my main in the glory days. Hope you enjoy it too!
---
The fact that August is far away is amazing. Summer and vacation &lt;3
---
(Life is more than a video game you know)
---
Happen to have a link to that horde stream?
---
Casual players didn't have purples.   That took groups and time investment.  
---
Dungeons frequently went 2-6 hours long (at the start, before people had good gear).  Raids spent 24 hours in a week to clear one raid instance.  Obviously, everything went faster as people  geared up and learned the fights.   All the raids are 40 man, so that's a lot of gearing up to do.
---
Do everything twice. To do your quests, and to get loot. Blue loot is a huge boost for xping.
---
Hell if you play tank or heal do them 5 times.
---
It's also fun since most are mazes and you'll find friends.
---
Get rdy to hate it. Wrath was peak wow. Vanilla is worse in every single way.
---
Nope, you could eat and drink with a dot on you.
---
Im just pokin fun man. Old friend is an MP now and is pumped for Classic.
---
It’s great!
---
It doesn’t go through westfall, so I will be leveling there to avoid big crowds 😂
---
That 1% is in reference to clearing Naxx40. Not percentile of people who raided. That myth came from a blue post on the EU boards who misspoke. Vanilla didn't even have 8 million subs.
---
Like others here said, mage and warlock are your best bet, mage is mostlikely the best bet, since warlock needs abit of gear to be good in 1vX, but on the flipsite warlock is broken in 1v1.
---
Hunter is fine to but kinda struggels a bit in duels, in open pvp 1v1 hunter is very good.
---
And Shaman could work too but he struggels in 1vX abit alteast compare to mage and warlock.
---
Maybe
---
Hunters scaled horribly in classic, even with the best gear to the point where in Naxx I was one of only 2 hunters in a 40 man and it was mostly due to kiting needs and the like. We weren't awful through BWL.
---
TBC on the other hand we were amazing one button mashers to the top of the charts.
---
I am not saying that it didn’t exist, at max level especially. Maybe it’s just me, but today I play games way more mechanically than I did back then. I used to really immerse myself into the worlds and just enjoy the game. Today I explore every nook methodically and try to optimise, so I don’t miss anything in games.
---
I like this build a lot, but one of the biggest problems with it is that it invests too heavily in the prot tree for what's ultimately a spec that is about generating the most amount of threat possible. Dual wield tanking is intended for maximizing damage output in defensive stance to generate absurd amounts of threat to allow dps to go balls to the wall. It is going to be rough on healing regardless, but some fights it is absolutely recommended to have a shield for certain parts to just survive.
---
I would suggest watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_azvBdVgz0&amp;t=307s as it goes over the main purpose of a dual wield build. The tree you outlined is too preoccupied with getting the most amount of % damage output from dual wielding, but ultimately at the cost of bloodthirst, enrage, and flurry which do a lot more for your damage than a % damage increase.
---
Like, you know that there was a time where no one had played Wow and everyone enjoyed and got addicted to it, right?
---
Vanilla has:
---
* 51 background colors
---
* 6 frame designs
---
* 17 frame colors
---
* 17 emblem colors
---
* 173 emblems
---
That's 15,299,082 possible tabard designs, which is more people than have ever played any version of WoW and certainly more than will ever play Classic.
---
But the anubisath hammer is going to be way harder to get and aq40 is not open at the beginning :D
---
Haha, I wish
---
We haven't heard of any non streamer, non F&amp;F invites going out in over a week. That plus the "rapidly decreasing" post from Blizzard means you can probably go ahead and reduce your checking to once a day lol.
---
Agree 100%. Never did pservers but was fury in vanilla and 3rd ot. Lots of druid gear went to waste when clearing aq and a bit in naxx. I got tank gear so late it was always average at best.
---
Ok, this may seem dumb but...
---
But...
---
Joana isn't a woman?!?!? I'm quite disappointed
---
We will have a balanced player base between classic and retail
---
&gt;we have met our current population needs for testing
---
Unless you're Friends &amp; Family or somehow valuable (and known) to Blizzard for marketing purposes, that's a no.
---
The instances are easy. Everything in classic is "easy" as long as you have a decent understanding of what you are doing.
---
They are great players, but calling them "pro hunters" (Although they might make money of the game, which turns them pro, but that was not what you meant) is a far stretch.
---
Everyone who actually knows how to play wow can clear SM pretty easily at lvl 36-37 and up. That does not make the game any worse though, but it really is not a hard game. It has never been. Even the hardest they can throw at us is easy by retails-standards.
---
The difficult parts is just in other aspects of the game
---
Chromaggus is gonna be impossible if this isnt fixed lmao
---
Short answer. Yes
---
Long answer. Hell yes.
---
Look for a mouse with 6 or so + buttons on the side. You can easily snd comfortably hit them all and use ctrl and alt as modifiers to have 18 easy to hit fast keybinds all on your thumb. Then start usuing keyboard binds easy ones. Should be fine. Highly highly reccomend getting into using macros too. Makes for less keybinds and more fluid play
---
Yeah it was also revealed than many private servers overturned mobs in order to make it feel more like the nostalgic image that a lot of Vanilla that many have in their head than how vanilla wow actually was
---
Civility exist because people fear the consequences....this is where internet is different.....welcome btw
---
This song is great but problematic.
---
 He is singing about now much he wants to transmog his gear.
---
We’ll regularly reevaluate the need for additional invites as we go through the testing process.
---
"Current" implies that number could rise in the future though.
---
I just check here every now and then to see if people say they got in. With the tone of their recent message I dont forsee a crazy amount of invites going out.
---
I've thought about becoming a BfA defender, even though I've never played it, simply because they burned that stupid tree stump down.
---
Everyone wants to say that all streamers got beta access.. but really they are a very small minority. But what you need to look at is this, WITHOUT any streamers.. or even limited good streamers... then that limits classic beta viewership. While we would all love to have beta access, the next best thing is to be able to view it from good streamers. As far as hard numbers on beta, does anyone have that? I feel like i saw a post about someone running an addon of some sort that tracked 8k unique people? But im unsure if that was just during the stress test or not.
---
Dam thats alot of designs

Once upon a time this recipe was rewarded from a low level quest in Teldrassil, then for one reason or another the recipe was to be removed in Cataclysm. I don't remember how but I picked up on this and made a few NElf alts to get some, sent them via neutral AH to my Horde banker, then sat on them for a while. This was the first one I put up, Jan 5th 2011 according to the file :)
---
Someone REALLY wanted to complete their collection.
---
Deal.
---
I've had summer and vacation for the last 12 years but no vanilla wow excuse me if i prefer something i haven't had in that long.
---
Plus its 101 degrees here this past weekend.  Summer means more indoor time when you live in the South.
---
I've been to the beach 20 times since February.  Can't wait to 'chill' inside with some classic wow.
---
You can go to either zone interchangeably. You'll have class trainers at both areas so you are totally clear to choose.
---
Then its your life thats outta whack. Fix your shit.
---
The rest of us are gonna enjoy life.
---
So whats Windfury?
---
As someone who dabbled in this, the real problem is having enough self control to not eat all your stock :&lt;
---
I am very interested. Always did tank myself. I am from Denmark so shipping is not bafd
---
Don’t leave us hanging, hit us with that playlist homeslice
---
Blizzard did have 8 million subs in Q4 of '06, any decent google search will confirm that.
---
According to an archive of wowjutsu, about 130 guilds cleared Naxx 40 before BC launched. That's 5200 people, or about 0.065% of the population.
---
i noticed the white zone/area text has been fixed to show friendly/contested/enemy territory, so they're definitely rolling out *some* fixes.
---
Does anyone know if there will be better addon in Classic for enemy casting? I am talking about one which will stop showing casting when enemy stops casting. As far as I remember, this was always an issue on pservers when enemy fakecasted but castbar did not stop loading.
---
Sure, if people quit playing, which they won't. If you're a subscriber, you might get into one of the stress tests. Don't hope for anything more.

---
&gt; Orc coz 25% stun resist is huge if you ever plan to pvp. No other racial beats that on shamans. None.
---
Warstomp into fire nova totem (+CL/shock) is pretty good as ele, or just stomp and heal etc. Shaman trinket also removes stuns so you're at least not completely defenceless in that regard.
---
Might not be better overall, but there's no rng element to it like stun resist so you can always rely on having it.
---
I've sort of been campaigning for group content to be buffed (like in private severs) for a couple weeks now. Vanilla really hit the sweet spot in terms of giving you that feeling of accomplishment but the avg gamer has come a long way since then. This video shows that challenging content can be a lot of fun and gratifying, but unfortunately there's no real reason to do something like this after release.
---
Obviously these guys are much better than the avg player but in it's current state same-level content will be very easy for most players. Private servers did a fairly decent job of trying to replicate the Vanilla "experience" by buffing content and it was very well received.
---
Just buy a wand from the first person rushing to make them in bulk.

Don't bother to make yourself 1 piece... honestly

Anyone who can give me the outoftheloop on this meme?

i dont think he logged out... looks like popped into another layer lmaooo
---
Evil person! :D
---
Didn’t they make retail leveling harder and more time consuming in an attempt to sell more boosts?
---
Can't learned 2-handers until you talent into it.
---
this, had the level cap been 60 you could be sure all the streamers would rush to 60 asap.
---
Great idea to cap it at 30.
---
Im not sure but I would guess that priest is the best 1v1 and mage the best 1vX, but it depents on the classes he fights.
---
Premade BG no idea, maybe hunter?
---
THIS IS A PRIVATE SERVER - YOU FOOLED US!
---
I had Ironfoe on my Combat Rogue back in Vanilla. Just insane DPS, as I remember it at least.
---
During legion I was the heaviest I've ever been in my life. Just after Tomb Launch I decided to quit and started getting myself into shape. Now I'm the strongest I've ever been. I don't want to throw all that work but I keep dreaming about not using any vacation this summer and blowing it all on Classic launch. Hope I get into Beta so I can feel it out and see if I really want to dive into the game again or it's just hype.
---
Those are specs within a class. Just because a specific spec isn't viable doesn't mean that the class is not viable.
---
Yes , I love it
---
As a Shaman and Druid player I have fond memories of casting my hearthstone to bait out spell school lockdowns :D
---
Yeah that was sadly funny
---
54 linen cloth aint a breeze collecting that early, is it?

First thing I always do is unbind turn left and right from "A" and "D"  and rebind them to strafe left and right.

he edited the post super cute

https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/Azn08QTPpAjcAA
---
personally I would do this
---
Thank you very much for the comments, i appreciate a lot &lt;3
---
Stop spreading false information. F&amp;F last went out on Friday. I know people who got in. Next wave is hopefully Tuesday but at it's a guessing game at this point.
---
great post, upvote!
---
Make an appointment with your local sexual health clinic.
---
There was a patch that went through late last week, fixed some things, broke some others.
---
You're not likely to see patch notes from beta build to beta build, just as you're not likely to see patch notes from PTR build to PTR build.  They're mostly between public releases to communicate what player facing things have changed. It's also why they cannot just auto-generate them from developer source control changes for example, as the root cause that fixes something isn't always relevant to players as the outcome of the change.
---
But then why is the list just blank? Wouldn’t it show red being unavailable?
---
It‘s not that hard as in some memories... they were new to the game, so they had the hard way. Now they know a lot more and think it‘s easier. Basic psychology:)
---
Not sure if you're trolling, but...
---
The trainer in Thunder Bluff only teaches Guns, Maces, Staves. 
---
As a Shaman, you know One-Handed Maces, Staves, and Fist Weapons by default.
---
You'll need to travel to Orgrimmar to learn One-Handed Axes and Daggers.
---
You can only learn Two-Handed Maces and Axes through the Enhancement talent tree. You need to be level 20 to reach this talent.
---
I wonder if it would stay fun without that fast addition of WSG to the beta.
---
Hear heal more like giving GoTW, Innervate and Brez or you'll be oom pretty fast.
---
Be prepared to be your Hpriest bitch.
---
Maybe if you want the game to be annoying as hell to play after 6pm.
---
whats the joke cuz i didnt get it
---
Easy ass game haha, all the dad gamers have been telling lies for 15 years about how hard Vanilla is.
---
maybe try reading everyone's comments before being so ignorant
---
Avoiding big crowds and westfall. :P
---
There will be more people in westfall regardless of the efficiency and these guides, people will go to westfall because it's a cool zone.
---
Pack up your things guys, the internet is been won for the foreseeable future
---
in short it has less than 1.12.1...
---
sad to hear... kinda hoped it would have a bit more and not less
---
I'm gonna guess no because for instance if you learn 2 handed weapons in your talent tree and then respec it will DELETE all of your 2hand weapon skills you've gained.
---
I made www.vanilla-info.com a while ago and try to keep it updated. :-)
---
Additionally to those, make sure that you can use your main and instacast abilities from your mouse. You want to have full control of your char movement at all times, while having full access to your interrupts, important consumables and main abilities. 
---
Example, if you have interrupt bound to F. Its fine if you want to strafe LEFT while doing the interrupt, but if you want to strafe RIGHT... you have to stop, interupt and continue moving. 
---
And most importantly, setup your keybinds from level 1 as you will play them at L60. You will have perfect muscle memory hitting L60 and dont have to spend time on relearning everything.
---
IIRC there's a quest in Desolace that requires either a bronze or copper tube.
---
 [https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq](https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq) is a pretty popular one right now
---
i think it depends on the starting zone you're in. Tirisfal Glades doesn't have too difficult of a time getting that much cloth from 1-10.
---
There's no difference in learning One-Handed Maces and Two-Handed Maces, it's just "Maces". The Thunder Bluff trainer will never show anything to a Shaman. You just can't *use* 2H Maces until you get the talent.
---
Damn, I'm just upset I didn't get a notepad with my Compaq computer now.
---
oh no i only fulfilled 2/3 of his criteria my bad dude
---
It's better if she runs to you
---
Leveling in The Barrens has been a staple since time immemorial 
---
Plus 2  good starter dungeons become available to you
---
Ragefire chasm in Orgrimm and Wailing Caverns in The Barrens
---
It's better if she finishes the starting zone and once she is level 6 gets on the zeppelin from Brill , Tirisfal Glades to Orgrimmar and you both meet at Razor Hill where you can start leveling both
---
I wasn't trying to be a dick in case I sounded like one. I genuinely don't understand what the difference is
---
Friends and Family invites are slowly going out. I wouldn't anticipate another RNG closed beta wave for another 2, maybe even 3 weeks.
---
I didn't count these in-game, I used an archive Tabard Designer. If there were more designs in 1.12.1, they'll be there.
---
Also dont cound color's into your equation.... a yellow or an orange bunny tabard is the same etc. what matters are frame design &amp; emblem/icons
---
Now that's a real problem, i'd say dont go long since Helms are clipping, but priest tiers are well designed.
---
I'd say randomize your char model and click OK on the one that fits your tastes.
---
I supposed. Personally i prefer focusing my efforts on supporting, Will be first duo-leveling with a warrior friend then we’ll do most of our playing together so if a rogue gets some miss-guided notion to stab at a plated out healer - a warrior will come charging like a mad man - such as they are with pocket healers.
---
It's an unpopular opinion because it's selfish and makes you an asshole.  
---
You don't want more people to experience Classic so you can shave off a couple minutes in the starting zone?  Literally wtf.
---
That piece of compaq paper is in very good state!
---
PrEP, or Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, is a medication that, when taken daily, is highly effective at preventing HIV. PrEP is a type of medication consisting of tenofovir and emtricitibine, usually called Truvada, which has been used in Australia to treat HIV since 2004.
---
Feign Death would be resisted almost all the time.
---
It not even available for you.  It's like a Mage trying to learn 2H axes;  it's just not possible.  Once you talent it, it becomes unlocked.
---
Relevant content generally means content that is generally current and/or provides some sort of progression. Sure all of classic is relevant at one point but once you get to 60, content 30ish and below is generally not worth doing except for professions or collections (which everyone hates now but people still collected shit in Vanilla). But I like the part where you ignore the other half of the sentence. "My friend didn't play WoW when I did so fuck him, he needs to level from 1-80 without heirlooms," instead of here's a boost so your friend can play with you now. 
---
I also disagree with the Hunter statement, getting your first pet wasn't fun. It was fun taming in general because different pets had different abilities, instead of almost all of them being the same now. 
---
Game was always designed for end game content even if half the people didn't make it there. Else patches wouldn't have kept introducing new raids or the fact that you know, a good portion of the WoW team in decision making positions were from top end Everquest guilds.
---
I don't have to imagine, I have flashbacks of being a baby Forsaken in the original beta, wandering the big mysterious road out of safety and seeing this motherfucker just sashaying right into my camera view. when I think about the atmosphere vanilla had this guy is definitely a thing I distinctly remember.

I've been spoiled by ElvUI.  So nice being able to just copy/paste some text and have my entire setup ready to go.
---
Nost had 8k pop at peak time for 3 months till it was shut down. Nost players will probably play classic and some. I'm skeptical of the 3-12 weeks.
---
Too bad i sleep at night 😅
---
\&gt;Classic, and to a slightly lesser extent TBC, was the greatest gaming experience of my life. In fact, at the time, I enjoyed playing WoW more than I enjoyed.. anything. 
---
/co-sign
---
Definitely Mage.
---
Retail levelling had got hugely easier over the past few expansions. A small part of that was recently undone prior to the introduction of heritage armor (which requires levelling without using a boost).
---
I suspect the goal was to make sure the heritage armor grind took longer, boosting engagent numbers. It's *possible* it was an attempt to sell boosts, but I doubt it. (Not like it matters, either way it was a ham handed attempt to boost a metric at the expense of the players.)
---
That being said, it's still vastly easier to level in retail than in classic. The world record for levelling to 1 to 120 is under 18 hours; the record for 1 to 60 in vanilla was over 4 days if I recall...
---
There was spell dmg rogue build your n some private servers and it pulled crazy numbers
---
Undead. You don't beat a SP who has one more dot and wotf. Now that would be a sad mistake if you're serious at it.
---
Hell, I'm an alliance player but if I wanted to play effective PVP SP terror, i'd switch to play this anyday.
---
Plausible that happens this Wednesday or Thursday, I'd say getting a beta invite anything after the 31st (Friday) is as unlikely as it gets.
---
Also, 1.12 itemization from the start is a huge change
---
Go on a high seas server that has instant 60, get all the spells and set or your bars and key binds. Take a screen shot and will save you a few hours if you are like me and need them perfect.
---
Gold Lion Shield from a quest in the Wetlands.
---
Why try to solo it though?   
---
Westfall will be packed, you will probably need to form a group either way.
---
Traps doesn't work in combat (Feign death sets you out of combat though so there is a trick)
---
You don't automatically start auto shooting in combat, it starts on either the skill itself or using another ranged attack spell.
---
... i asked for classic not 1.12.1...
---
Classic is not 1.12.1... they are similar and Classic is meant to copy it but they are not the same as Classic can derail from it so please never confuse these two :)
---
Classic is run on a 7.1.5 engine, you can trade items after loot and much more... Classic is blizzards attempt to "refine" it so by no means should it
---
I dont have access to a kvm switch and dont want to have to unplug the keyboard and mouse from my work pc to my mini pc.
---
Foot pedals are slow anyways and a keyboard + regular gaming mouse (2 side buttons)has more than enough binds for everything.
---
Thanx... I guess?
---
After thinking about it . I can just map tab target to one of the buttons.
---
The same in terms of pacing and most raiding aspects.
---
But a few things I didn't like of TBC:
---
* Flying. That destroys a lot of the world interraction and pacing of the game.
---
* Arena and resilience. It took too long, generally very boring to play since resilience made everyone a tank.
---
But raiding super good and despite being 20 compared to vanilla 40 raid. It still kinda had the same feel to it.

Classic was a casual, babies first MMO experience.  If he doesn't like that then Classic isn't the game for him.  If he wants Dark Souls Lite he should stick to private servers that crank the dial to 11 on difficulty.  I'm sure many people will prefer that.
---
Rogue Mage
---
There will be ALOT of warriors. They are the real tanks and fury is really strong late. Check out speedruns from private servers and you will see that its like 25 warriors lol.
---
This is true.
---
cute
---
I *am* a beta tester and if you had a better attitude, I might have decided to check in-city tomorrow when I get out of bed, but now you can settle to wonder for 3 more months.
---
This man loves his tendies
---
If all you want to do is story questing then regular WoW would be better. If you want to join a guild and do raids and dungeons then WoW classic is better because it builds communities.
---
Those dragon bones in Desolace. Its not a hot spot but that is where I fought 1v1s against a mage during questing my entire satuday. I lost the first few but always won later on. Thats where I had to "learn" for the first time. Adapt my playstyle to win.
---
I overcome a roadblock that day. The first day after I woke up feeling like a High Warlord.
---
I was a level 34 paladin as 12 year old.
---
Warrior and mage for sure. Least will be Druid.
---
You need a flask of supreme power for these numbers though
---
Everything they are adding are purely technic stuff that would have probably been enabled if they had the tech back in the days. And they want to delete it once they have less players anyways. 
---
I'd say that Classic will be better than Vanilla.
---
Do I have to buy the latest expansion to play WOW classic?
---
Human or Gnome is totally preference, I liked the root escape but honestly unless you're totally min maxing it won't matter end of day :) 
---
&gt;&gt;I can tell you it learned me how to play the game the right way.
---
I agree 100% w/ this. Learning macros for Succubus, Fell Hunters, fear-juggling, threat management, and all the little fun stuff you can do with Warlock is a treat in classic WoW
---
Warrior is the worst 1v1 class
---
Rogues are THE 1v1 class (every 10 min or so)
---
Supply and demand
---
The 8th wonder of the world
---
A lot of people have experienced the launch and economy of vanilla before, so you will be competing with veterans, and many thousands of them at that. This kinda stuff is easy in beta where there are hardly any players, and it will still be very profitable in live regardless, but you won't be cornering any easy markets like copper tubes and deviate delights come launch. You will be competing with plenty of smiths and fishers, even exclusive fishers that don't care about leveling will be trying to get their money in order before they bother with PvE or PvP.
---
Looking at the beta, there are even people running around in teams helping one person get veins and stuff. Doing that solo won't be possible (read: fast/safe enough) at first on a PvP realm for a while and you will lose that race. Especially if there are guilds feeding members stuff too, which will be a problem even on PvE realms.
---
Even better: Trade some linen for it. Most people rushing ench will happily agree so they can keep up their speed.
---
Well to be fair, you really can't do all 3 unless you have infinite amounts of gold for respeccing.
---
Warriors being the worst 1v1 class, does that mean in an even/fair 1v1 with "equal" skilled or close to it players, the warrior will almost always lose? Or are there things a warrior player can learn to give them a chance?
---
**Top 3:**
---
Warrior
---
Priest
---
Mage
---
**Mid tier:**
---
Paladin
---
Rogue
---
Warlock
---
Hunter
---
**Low tier**
---
Druid
---
druids for sure        
---
warriors will have a huge population but im sure very few will endure that 1-36 auto attack grind
---
Wow was always easy. You ever play other mmos that aren’t just wow clones? Dark age of Camelot anyone? That game fucking hated you for playing it
---
Wut.
---
The hardest part was keeping 40 people on the same page and not killing each other for months on end.
---
If you could beat that raid boss game is easy
---
F
---
Is 5k armor including sunder armor and faerie fire?
---
one of the things i hate about modern wow: how the developers don't realize how memorable fixed loot tables are. I still remember nearly all my bis loot from wrath and where i got it from.
---
Based on the several large strawpolls here (10,000+ responses), the top classes are going to be:
---
1. Warrior 
---
2. Mage
---
3. Priest/Warlock
---
4. Rogue/Hunter/Druid
---
5. Shaman/Paladin
---
That is hilarious...! I have stories kind of in the same vein, but the thought of sitting there logged in, praying enough items sell that I can buy back my only gear from the vendor I sold it to as some sort of makeshift pawn shop, fearing getting disconnected and losing it all... That's just great. You can't manufacture that kind of anxiety.
---
Hahaha wow. He has issues
---
Strong in pvp, but really hard to gear up.
---
Hi, /u/Manjyome
---
&gt;F&amp;F l
---
Excuse me for asking, but what is F&amp;F?
---
carefull you will join me on the downvote train
---
What I really want to know, is the number of warriors created at launch, vs the number that actually make it to 60.
---
Cool, picked all of that up in PvP. But no one ever sees what hunters do in raids or small groups. Glad streaming brings some perspective there.
---
I'm doing my part!
---
Vanilla forms
---
Hey man!
---
I have been given it some thought... Classic won't hit the shelves until the end of August and tomorrow my summer "vacation" starts. I will work, but my job is not nearly as intense as my school. 
---
I was thinking.. If you're still up for the working on a ret-pally coloumn, I'm up for the job. Either way I think I will add the last four speccs (prot pally, ret, boomkin and enhancement).
---
If you are, please contact me in a PM instead.
---
I played Lock from Classic through Frozen Throne, hardcore PvE with some PvP sprinkled it. 
---
I played Mage from Classic through Burning Crusade, and then mained it when I came back in BFA (I did a little MoP and zero Cataclysm). 
---
Warlock has always just felt more fun to me, the class feels like it has more flavor, I love managing my curses, spells, pet macros, dots, etc. I just feel like I can always improve a little bit more when I'm raiding as a warlock, whereas with Mage I never really felt like I wasn't already doing 98-99% of my job just fine. 
---
To me, Warlock has always been the harder class to play, but it's infinitely more satisfying for me in both PvP and PvE because it feels like the decisions you make in both are both more numerous, and feel so much better when you play perfect/very well. 
---
Also, I really hated leveling as a mage. I really enjoyed pulling loads of mobs, dotting them all up, and kiting around. I tried to PvP as a mage and it just didn't do anything for me.
---
For 40, use DKP. And I'm a guild leader. And it bothers me, I much prefer loot council, when It's fair It's the best.
---
But with 40 and less classes, you cannot be as fair, DKP will be the best way. Dont dez if people wants to save their points, make people /rand items.
---
Whyyy... 😭
---
&gt; The only major difference is that your pet is useless in raids
---
what? you can use your pet in the vast majority of raid fights in vanilla, it can contribute like 15% of your total dps if you control it properly and keep it alive
---
Asmond's chat was basically every Pal/Sham/Druids experience in Vanilla. "bro, this guys sucks, look at his terrible damage!1!!". They have no idea how much he helped his team and that makes me sad for the re-release.
---
Offhand quest reward from a lv 40ish quest in badlands. Be smart and never ever sell this item.
---
What's teleport protection?
---
I’d rather play a race I like the look of than play a fat midget with a shit ton of pubes on his face just for a racial, it’s a 15 year old game that most people have done all the content for many times, people will be fine without a dwarf
---
That's a totally fair gripe. I just liked being tiny and having the root escape.
---
Asking an NPC for a mortgage on your gear - one crash (or disconnect) later and you would have lost it all. This feels pretty much like real life.
---
Wow. A long, long time ago, I created some Stepmania tracks for some of the more upbeat wow tracks. It didn't work as well as I'd hoped since wow music is mostly ambient but it had it's moments... But the point of the story is I named the collection of tracks Stance Dance Revolution.  I'd totally forgotten about this. Now I want to see if I can find them.
---
Because the whole idea of Classic is to return to vanilla?
---
Warriors have the least options to win 1v1 fights. Rogues have a bunch of cool downs that can be used to give them an advantage, or reset a fight and start again. Warriors have one 30 minute cooldown that is very obvious and easy to avoid, and beyond this are extremely weak against kiting/slows. 
---
Warriors are beasts in organised pvp, with healers backing them.
---
239.99
---
Obviously vanilla forms. None of that retail nonsense for anything. 
---
You can be happy about the shadows and legion water if you like that kinda thing
---
threat puller into dead dps
---
Does not sound very legit...
---
If you truly where a beta tester you would have realized what i asked at the start...
---
`Will the list of icons be expanded upon ? or will it remain strictly the same ?`
---
This was not a question about 2006 said but what classic beta did... so honestly it sounds more like a made up excuse that you now claim to be a beta tester....
---
get over yourself... you made a mistake and its embarrasing, and then move on but to make up a lie to cover up shame afterwards that is just childish...
---
This is so cool! Azeroth somehow feels larger when simplified like this! :) Ty for sharing!
---
Probably hunters, people love to level with a hunter
---
laptop is more than good enought if the screen isnt big enought just use a hdmi and a monitor and external keyboard thats what i did
---
It could pretty easily be affected by sea floor level. Maybe theres a longer stretch of shallows along darkshoe, so the dock needs to extend all the way out to deep water. Versus other ports where the water gets deep very quickly
---
Family  &amp; Friends
---
Know a blizzard employee and you have a chance
---
so you're just lying. gotcha.
---
go play bfa.
---
But only like 100 got in. And we are still over 10k F&amp;F Users or so :D
---
In what world did you think I implied not enjoying life lol.
---
Jesus are you sure you're on the right subreddit r\incel is that way.
---
My God he looks forward to playing a game!  What a sad individual.  Lol.  I won't bother bragging about my house, wife, fun job, or out of country trips.  God I hate life so much!!
---
And talents. A lot of group content was hard simply because warriors sucked at threat generation. Even when shield slam was added it was garbage until they buffed it significantly later.
---
Have the same problem with my girlfriend, except that she loves UD start area and I'm gonna play a Shaman. Have to keep HS in Orgrimar or something since UC doesn't have Shaman trainers =(
---
But how many of those warriors are true tanks? :Thinking:
---
I get that. And sorry if I’m stepping on toes, but I took classic as a remaster. Hence the reason why from what I’m seeing we’re getting some modern qol changes like modern UI frames, auto loot, and name plates. While I’m excited for the older classic wow game play and RPG styling, I assumed we would keep some model updates that most people would agree was good for the game, despite retail being in a sorry state.
---
I have a PvP [Prot pally twink](https://imgur.com/a/dOYdDoO) from Wrath (I think) with the trinket and Ironfoe. There was some mental on hit build teenage me thought would be OP in bgs.
---
I wouldn't say it was casual. It might be easy but the consumes/attunes/gear farming made it pretty non casual.
---
It was a time sink. The fights were easy but the time investment was high.
---
Thanks!
---
I left wow in WOD and haven’t looked back. Played classic, raided in classic. Did the private server thing for a short while. 
---
At this point I have walked away fe classic, will not resubscribe to access classic or retail. 
---
This is not bashing classic, if you’re a player that never got to experience it for whatever reason I highly recommend you give it a try. It was a great game exceptional for its time. 
---
But to answer OP’s question none, it will take no money for me to turn my back and walk away. 
---
However if I had not played back then. I would be hyped to get to see what everyone was so passionate about.
---
Here is a really good advice, create your alt asap and max the blue out of it. Will make it much much easier to level.
---
roughly 20% procrate, no internal cooldown and it can even proc from itself (means the extra attack counts as valid attack to proc again).
---
Some items in vanilla were just insane
---
I'm elated to say they are vanilla forms. I've always been a druid main, and it's a huge highlight to me.
---
Somebody should tell the horde not to bother raiding since they can’t get fear ward.
---
25% in Vanilla math is very close to 100%
---
Look here, someone who haven't seen or played  vanilla =)!
---
Did you test this? Cause I tried it out but unlike on pservers the first mainland point to drop an die on still sent me to brill GY.
---
They should let people kite Kazaak since it will be camped by the top guilds very very fast, it shouldnt be a big problem.
---
The amount of fun that the first month of Classic will be priceless. 
---
I wouldn't miss that first month for anything, unless an actual apocalypse happened irl.
---
Don’t worry about it. An entire fucking faction raids without it just fine. People on here are just obnoxious with min/max bullshit.
---
&gt; Knowing what spell to use when. (Hint. Its Frostbolt)
---
Hello, my name is Chromaggus.
---
I can't find any reliable source that states that. Everything I can find that isn't from some random is Vanilla PEAKING at 7 mil.
---
Well it depends what u plan for vanilla do you want to be in a tryhard guild that clear content asap --&gt; go gnome
---
do you really want to be top dps (that also means farm ALOT of consumabels)--&gt;go gnome
---
do you want to have fun in vanilla raid with a normal guild and just enjoy the game--&gt;play whatever u want
---
Needs windfury
---
Yes sir. Sorry but that was the best way I could explain it.
---
From a shaman's perspective..
---
It's going to be great early on. It used to proc off itself and WF would chain proc it again, ridiculously overpowered. It also used to do 3 attacks.
---
But I wouldn't waste your time farming it. Originally it was around 0.1% drop, by 1.12 was it 0.3%? Not too bad but still.. that's a long time farming vanilla and you want to be sure you're going to be the only roller.
---
By 1.12 it wasn't as good and you started eyeing BWL/Naxx weapons or Hoeto.. as a shaman anyway. It no longer double-procced or chained like it used to.
---
How I know? I used it.. a lot.  https://imgur.com/QVUGkbT
---
Realize you're lucky that you didn't randomly D/C before you bought your items back.
---
'bout tree fiddy
---
While you are right, this is what Esfand is proving. Its not about speed, min and Max. Its about clearing content in a steady pace - no matter your race or class. You play to have fun and play your class to the fullest.
---
Probably more than that. Classic leveling is a bitch and I don't think people who haven't played it realize that.
---
&gt; I’m considering horde Druid
---
I'm so sorry.
---
Cool... now do 3-60.
---
Rude. I miss Teldrassil. Darnassus bank is best bank.
---
How are we looking on the quest add-on front? Is one looking better than others?
---
It really sounds like a "How to start Word" Guide for people that dont know what a PC is ^^   
---
Nothing bad about that though. Its definitely better to explain a little bit too much than it is to explain not enough.
---
The single pad ones are great for push to talk - was going to say I'd probably get confused with three, but I'm a driver so... hmmm...
---
If you never played Hpriest you'll have a blast. HPal is also a blast, but you will spend lots of time refreshing buffs.
---
Cant speak for Rsham.
---
I believe that Warrior, Rogue, Mage and Priest will be the most common classes. With Warrior being the most popular of the four.
---
&gt;I'm incredibly jealous of small girls that can sit with their legs crossed in a regular office chair. I'm 100% going to fall backwards if I try to get one leg up on the chair...
---
I'm a 182cm bloke and manage it all the time. It's more about flexibility than size
---
Nowhere was it called “ A remaster” it is and will be the old character models, male night elves hands will be bigger than their heads, just as they were until they got a model update. 
---
They community outcry of “NO CHANGES” was heard and followed through on.
---
Gl in life Arthur ^_^
---
"dew bottle" is the best euphemism I've heard...
---
Will class roles for raiding (ie Paladin only being healer, warrior being the only viable tank etc) be redefined due to the more experienced and wider access of knowledge in the modern player base? Or has this stuff been so theory-crafted due to pservers and the original run that it is pretty much set it stone?
---
Thanks! I'm leveling up a rogue right now on a normal server. I used to have a 60 rogue so I know where to put them all and what macros to use so I think I'm good on that end. Good idea though.
---
27" is fine, you have 3 of them
---
That is an amazing invention
---
This is also what Esfand is saying. Have fun and play what you want like you want. Many people think Vanilla is hardcore but it isnt. I cant wait to have a blast with my friends exploring Classic 😄
---
I use F keys for lots of non combat stuff but yeah fuck that in combat
---
Same reason people don't transfer to other MMOs: People have done a shitload of stuff in retail, basically it's an escalation of commitment going on. Of course this is just one aspect of many, but I doubt the player numbers of Classic will be soooo much higher than retail in the long run.
---
Back then the game didn't automatically detect when you warped around like it does now... with logging and automatic disconnecting.
---
So you could do the teleporting without disconnecting, and unless you got reported it wouldn't flag you as having hacked.
---
Early game = Hunters will be top. Late game = they will be bottom.
---
Sadly didn't play Hunter in TBC but from what I know they did pretty well. Hunters can do certain things really well, they can do tricks and farm other classes cannot do, but at the end it will be hard to top metres with them.
---
It would be good for modifiers like shift imo
---
No, but I also didn't include Mangle.
---
The best rogue theorycrafters were much better at this than I am and they all came to the same conclusion:
---
5CP Rupture &gt; 5CP Eviscerate
---
Namely because Rupture costs 10 less energy.
---
you are missing the small secret/hidden island below Tanaris which you only visit for the scepter questline once.
---
I will mention it to her she does like the barrens
---
Agreed on the updated point. However the example you use not so much, I took this screenshot during the stress test and Tukui worked more or less perfectly. https://imgur.com/a/DwBKEMd
---
The only gripe I have with it is that you cant increase the size of your chat (although that might be how it works on live too so im not sure its a bug).
---
Standing still must have been so unbearably difficult!
---
Ooo sad to hear.  But will be worth it to play together!
---
Same. I've been using tukui in classic and its working pretty well. Clean and minimal.
---
The problem is no, most of the people with insane vanilla nostalgia goggles didn't play anything but WoW. They have no idea that WoW was basically that era's dumping ground for the baddies who couldn't handle the other MMOs.
---
No but they can heal the party members in the dungeons
---
You mean block trade or any other chat channels? That's pretty much what any LFG addon would be doing in classic is just adding a GUI to that, and letting like minded people find groups on THEIR OWN server.
---
I don't support any sort of automated grouping but I do support a user interface being added to a channel specifically for finding groups.
---
The second moon went away sometime in vanilla, apparently by accident, and wasn't readded until like WoD or MoP or something.
---
tbf, many people still think it is and wont use it. And out if those that know how good it is, many probably wont even specc into it.   
---
Threat management in leveling dungeons will be quite wonky. Even seasoned warriors will lose aggro occasionally due to misses, patrols, level differences, etc.
---
So roughly 1750 raiding shadow priests. Still not good odds.
---
Well there are a few points in what you say that are wrong. For example, you say fuck your friend because he has to level. Leveling in vanilla is the game, to the contrary of the following expansions. What people usually do is they create an alt to play with friends, and one to play solo. There's no "fuck him", why would there be?
---
Second, I don't see why you're saying it wasn't fun. But we can probably agree that it was rewarding, right? You know, that feeling of having progressed that you don't get anywhere anymore in retail?
---
Finally, your conclusion is wrong about end game content. Blizzard kept introducing new raids because they wanted to keep the players that finished the game, not because the rest was not "the real game" (at least in vanilla.) So for relevance, well same goes. Your 30 dungeons are really relevant during leveling (which is the game.) you're getting upgrades that will last you for ten levels or more sometimes. Ofc for 60s it's not relevant, but the game isnt just being 60.
---
I think warlocks will be the most popular class.
---
No worries. Keybindings are such a vital part of pvp that they should be custom fit to you. I have had my pvp trinket bound to F since basically  the beginning of time haha, it’s such a reflex now to hit it.
---
The Classic Beta is 7GB 👍
---
It was casual when it released. MMOs back then were more of a niche thing and pretty hardcore.
---
Just trying to help you out buddy. Only way to get the best of both worlds.
---
those comments are from retail people for sure.
---
reads like r/drama posters.
---
It is important even before instant attacks because a good warrior will hamstring the mob, running away between their weapon swings, which will keep 3-4 of the mobs faster attacks from hitting you, making you take half damage or less from each mob. Then you run back in when your weapon is about to swing and repeat.
---
You are also assuming all guilds only had 1 SP and not good odds against what? What numbers are you comparing?
---
Why would the icons be any different than 1.12.1? They're not adding ANY content to any part of the game, just features that let them be more hands-off (like loot trading).
---
I don't care if you think I'm a beta tester or not, I've been posting about the beta for a long time. Envious much?
---
Don't be a dick or you won't be wearing any guild tabard.
---
Mangle arrived in BC, it make sense not to take it into account. But the 10 less energy is interesting. A quarter sinister strike to add to the overall damage
---
The difference is separation. Two different groups of people don't share the world anymore. TBC is the expansion I actually played as well and liked it for quite while but there were the first problems that broke the community instead of creating and forcing them together that was seen especially in open world. I've played on private servers since and it's a bigger factor than most people think that everyone shares one world.
---
That's one reason why I hope we don't go for repeating expansions rote because each time we reach a little closer to what retail is today. Gating zones is big no for me (as nobody). It creates artificial boundaries and a wall that breaks immersion. Having too high level mobs wandering in area is always better since you realize on your own that this zone is not for you yet.
---
You've got some issues.
---
"yikes"
---
TheMechanic is god tier hunter. I saw on defend in WSG... He rocked it sooo hard.
---
I don’t remember if it was vanilla or tbc, but I used to have this addon called Paranoia - it would alert you if players from the enemy faction were in the vicinity. It worked by scanning the combat log and based on the spell used and rank of it would alert you “so-and-so class level 14+ named ‘noobkiller’” - then within the alert you could click on the name and it would “/target noobkiller” at which point you would see his level, class and race (but not necessarily WHERE he was). 
---
Of course, it didn’t work if the player wasn’t engaging in any combat, so you could still be surprise ganked, but not as often.
---
Though it can be used for evil (seeking out people to gank), I, being a bad player, used it defensively. If Paranoia alerted me of an enemy player around, I’d immediately go stealth (I was a rogue) until I found them and found out their intentions. If I knew I was relatively safe, I’d continue on.
---
Is there any chance beta invites will be sent out on a daily basis? I’d like to know if my constant checking and refreshing is futile :p
---
So if I understand him correctly Classic is correctly tuned?
---
No, no they are not. Shamans are great in dungeons, but good in raids, not great. Their heals are not the best, priests and paladin do a better job at direct healing - but shamans have ankh, they have totems and tons of utility.
---
Thanks bud. Don't worry I will never give in to the morons!
---
20% proc rate? From what I read it was around 7.
---
I mean sure axe spec is the best before you are geared but in reality while leveling you go with the highest damage weapon you can get even if it's a mace or sword (or staff or pole arm)
---
Absolutely! It'll be fun! :) We're quite a few friends who'll start playing together.
---
He's an edgelord
---
not everyone has their computers bought for them by parents, just fyi.
---
I don't know how you define difficulty but I don't agree with it. Classic boss design sucked, I mention that time and time again (1 or maybe 2 pretty boring abilities for the most part) but the entire rest of the dungeons was punishing. You could not ignore mobs' abilities (heals etc) had to use CC and couldn't pull several groups at once. Cata heroics used to be that + really cool and versatile boss design. Then they nerfed it to slightly above WotlK difficulty.
---
Only because shit is easy when you do it properly doesn't mean it's objectively easy. The challenge comes from having to do it properly. I'm so fucking tired of classic antagonists going "lol classic wasn't hard rofl" when factually people like you BAWED their eyes out at the start of Cata while classic veterans fucking loved it. 
---
There are more ways to making something difficult than a dance dance revolution level of complication in a character's rotation. Classic forced you to think about what you do and be careful. If you didn't - you died. That's difficulty. Dark Souls (franchise) is the same. If you're careful and time your dodges well, the games are piss easy. But if you don't you die - a lot.
---
Feral Druid uses all the same talents for PvE and PvP, thats definitely an option. Unfortunately I want to raid as feral but pvp as balance, so I plan to respec often ha.
---
Nah, they die and a lot of guilds told you to dismiss them.
---
I don't think you can find one DPS meter from a significant boss, historical or pserver, that shows hunter pets being 15% of a hunter's DPS.
---
Now you've gotta deliver if true.
---
Doh, you're right. It's hard to read these EJ archives sometimes.
---
Oh well for let‘s say a few 100k i would turn my back on it, i mean i can wait two more years for bc then 😂
---
they have tremor totem, and people always bring that up.  it's an inferior spell.  it's timing based, you have to drop it at the right time, right before the fear goes out but not so early that the totem disappears before the fear happens (which was not necessarily on a strict timer in vanilla, bosses used abilities within a window).  So the shaman had to be in the tanks' group, know about when to use the totem, drop it correctly, and then the tank would still get feared for a second before the totem pulsed and broke it.
---
Whereas with fear ward the fear just completely got negated and then you reapplied the fear ward, completely nullifying the tank mechanic.  This was a real advantage.  More importantly, alliance do not have tremor totem and their way to deal with this mechanic is dwarf priests.
---
I mean, it's a funny meme, but 70% of the playerbase will be on retail at any given time. You will have a lot of people trying classic since it's free if you already have a sub, but not many of them are going to like it and stay. A lot of people are coming back just for Classic, maybe even a couple million, but no more than a few hundred thousand of them will stay either.
---
After the first 2 months when the hype dies down and people are tired of the rough leveling, the lack of flying mounts, low bag space, no LFG/LFR etc. we will see the Classic player base settle at under 2 million. They will be lucky to keep 1 million by the end of the year. Those are great numbers for a game from 2004 and is more than Blizzard can hope for, but it's nowhere near the "majority" of WoW players. It will in fact be a very small minority.
---
There was very little reason to bring 1 SP. 
---
There was absolutely zero reason to bring 2.
---
That's the exact point. If you are leveling on a slower pace you can just wait till the first wand comes to you  naturally.
---
For everyone who really wants to speed things up the lesser magic wand will be a huge damage and speed increase. Even more than the greater one. And obtaining it around d level 5-7 for around 20 silver makes it pretty feasible for most players.
---
I mean you should be fine if you know what you're doing. Definitely don't need to go prot for leveling dungeons.
---
The problem is most people are spamming sunder when it's a lot easier to hold threat with heroic strike/cleave and clever use of battle shout at lower levels. Most of your threat is coming from straight up damage and the D-stance modifier while leveling, not the base threat that sunder gives.

Super interested as well! Thanks for doing that ❤️
---
Ever since the release announcement, this place has been swamped by retail apologists. Vanilla purists are getting ridiculed and downvoted.
---
pservers and flat out wrong procrates, name a more iconic duo.
---
oh nevermind, pservers and neonazis are by far the most iconic duo.
---
Ahh dude, 4 strength, 4 stam leather belt. AARHH, Level 18?! AAUHHUUUUHGGGH
---
It was more casual than some other mmos when it was released but I still wouldn't call it casual even by 2004's standards (except for maybe the leveling process because everquests leveling was literally "hey find a group and grind mobs").
---
Maybe some people like the old graphics.
---
true
---
Okay yeah it does save you some downtime on hamstring kites that makes sense. 
---
I’m still think sword would be just fine, and maybe even a little better for multi target pulls. Unless; do you hamstring kite multiple mobs at a time?

---
The looting is a good thing imo
---
I can see how splitting a player base can be a problem. Look at wrath, the zones were huge and 3 different areas players could be in
---
Frankly it's mostly useless. As a warrior you always go for a 31 points talent.
---
So you either go 31 points prot or 31 point fury.
---
Passing on tactical mastery in arms is a big problem imo. 
---
As a warrior if you don't stance dance you're missing 2/3 of your abilities.
---
I seriously doubt you will have the time to first grind out feral and balance gear and then farm enough gold to regularly respecc while raiding (which is expensive by itself) and doing pvp.   
---
I am not saying you cant or shouldnt do it though. I just want to warn you that you may be in for a very cruel reality check.
---
How many will there be? Will be good to quest will someone!
---
Late 30's iirc
---
You call yourself a *powergamer*, yet you don't want to play X and Y class or race because "they are not fun", or it goes against your "Roleplay culture".
---
You describe a *powergamer* (I cringed typing this word) as someone who min-maxes (yet, with your own race and class restrictions), yet 80% of this subreddit are people who are going to min-max, are they also *pOwErGaMeRs* too?
---
i like the idea of the site but navigating it is a pain, can't open links in new tabs and hitting back puts you back at the start
---
DING DING DING !!! And our first Godwin point of the day is attributed to Lithovore !!!!
---
You should give more information, like which content you are most interested... raids, dungeons, solo farning, pvp? What type you prefer most, melee?range? Tabk? Dps?
---
Well, that's still some useful info :)
---
Is..is that what neo-nazis are doing these days? Grinding to 60 on their troll shaman?
---
No Barman Shanker for Rogue? :o
---
Maybe I mixed it up with another item? Anyway its still a powerful item and it procs pretty often compared to items where the proc is like 1% chance.
---
Not only is the skill increased, also the knowlage.
---
And now we know for sure hybrid classes or "meme" specs will always be less optimal.
---
But you can play whatever you want and there is no need for an optimal raid comp untill Naxx. And if Naxx is open longer than retail (3 months) people will get more gear and I dont think even Naxx would recruire an perfect setup.
---
World PvP was dead long before, hence why they tried and failed to incentivize it with lolsand and EPL towers. Nothing but a scapegoat.
---
some might say they even run it to this day
---
On Pservers were they have upped the difficulty on raids druids were still a viable main tank in MC, some of BWL and when they get AQ-gear, also in AQ and Naxx.
---
A serious raiding guild will have atleast 1 bear tank.
---
Every time I see posts like this I feel so happy that people like you will likely never be designing games with your god awful "inconvenience and annoyance are FUN" mentality.
---
Also since you are man and wife I assume you have some level of trust between you 
---
Since you are both cloth users
---
I suggest only 1 of you take tailoring and make gear and bags for both of you while you both funnel Cloth drops in to that person
---
and use the remaining 3 profession slots on gathering professions such as Skinning, Mining and w/e else
---
With having a Mage to make drinks for both of you and 3 gathering and tailoring you can spend almost nothing and make more than enough money to get you started both once you get 40 and 60 lvl
---
You can make Bags and sell em on AH with everyone starting everyone will want bags ASAP
---
You can vendor the early leathers for decent profit per beast and sell Devilsour leather with the abundance of Rogues and Warriors at start ..
---
You can mine and send ore and stones to an alt with big bags and save up for potential Engineering or BSmithing respec in the future
---
You can do the same with Herbs for Alchemy and Transmute in later phases of the game
---
Pressing control with the palm of your hand beats out using a finger to press another modifier

Might not be comfortable if your keyboard keys are too flat though

https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=30273&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=47604
---
mouse over the hunters, auto attack / claw  is pet damage. that's from literally the first result that came up when i put "hunter" in the filter. feel free to try yourself
---
Thank you! I had a brain fart and for some reason thought that we'd be the 26th when the US is the 27th... no idea why!
---
Or they didn't fucking know because every one was clueless and you couldn't inspect talents.
---
Shamans are extremely sought after, even if their heals aren't top tier, their totems are so ridiculously good that you bring along as many as you can fit in your raid. Mana tide totem and windfury for every single group is incredible, and having a spamable aoe heal on top of that is even better.
---
So not wanting summer to be over because I prefer having vacation and enjoying summer more than a video game is issues? I am pretty sure we know who has issues based on that assumption mate.
---
Anyways, its great that it releases at the end of summer. I can enjoy the entire summer, and as soon as it ends I get to play classic. Best of both worlds.
---
Looks good, Tailoring link on the warlock page links to herbalism FYI.
---
1. Huge difference. Rogue is one of the best dueling/solo wpvp class, warrior is one of the worst if not the worst.
---
2. Warriors: usually at least one warrior, maybe more they do very well in premade bgs.
---
Rouges: kinda meh. You find them for some niche jobs like camping flag room but not necessary to have.
---
3. rogue hands down 
---
4. I’d say rogue has a higher skill ceiling by the sheer amount of important cooldowns they have to manage.
---
Interesting, I know that they can't show bones and stuff like that, but what mount did the undead have as a replacement then? They didn't just give them nothing, did they?
---
Yes but if you want max damage for meters you sort of have to use all your abilities as they do damage even if not worth it mana
---
Are you ready to be 1 hour before raid, have your bags full of food and water to trade to your raid? Have alwats lot of mana potions tp drink in every fight etc? Then go mage. I am not saying this as a bad thing for mage i love mage and was my main (and probably will be too). Just be aware it needs lot more preparation than a rogue for example. Rogue does not even have to buff teammates, no mana potions, etc. Its the most "log n play" class of vanilla.
---
retail is garbage.
---
Not making a troll mage. Smh
---
hmmm let's see
---
Human paladin, Dwarf hunter, Gnome mage, Night elf rogue, Orc warrior, Undead warlock, Tauren druid, and Troll Shaman
---
i think that's what i would go with
---
You can't feign mobs 10+ levels higher than you, it just gets resisted.
---
He streams daily too, talks about his alliance guide haha
---
I agree about locks. I think we'll see them way more than in the actual vanilla. Keep in mind locks were kinda a secret weapon of vanilla, they got buffed later. At the beginning they were so bad.
---
However it's been for such a long time since vanilla. So many people have started playing lock as their main on retail since then. Locks have been for so many years a class with at least one really strong spec, both in PvP and PvE. It's one of the few classes that's been a safe bet to play for years now, so obviously so many people found love in locks. And I think many people will play their retail mains in Classic, even if they stopped playing retail.
---
I don't like giving pservers as example, but it's obvious locks are way more popular than they were in vanilla. I've seen them even in the top 3 when people were asked what they're going to play.
---
From what I've gathered, locks will be way more popular than in Classic than they were in the actual vanilla, meanwhile hunters will be less popular. Hell the last "what you're going to play" I saw even rogues being under locks.
---
I hate everything about this screenshot. It’s hard to describe; from the new models, the matching awful armour, the dbz hair cut - it all comes together to piss me off. 
---
Classic can’t come any sooner.
---
I absolutely love my g13.
---
I don't know how to determine threat generation without an addon, and those addons haven't been updated.
---
But if you figure that out and tell me how to do it on Horde, I'll get you the numbers.
---
I do know that all threat reduction is now multiplicative, not additive. That was in 1.12.0.
---
Also, we can't get Improved Master Demonologist, that's 34 to 39.
---
Parry an attack...
---
Use Riposte...
---
Riposte gets parried...
---
/sigh
---
We have add-ons that auto need. They bundle with all our class specific add-ons.
---
No way priest is top 3.
---
Ah alright, thanks for the input. I liked warrior since they could tank and dps in PvE and were decent in PvP but being bad in wPvP/1v1's kind of sucks, not to mention that warrior is basically just getting kited:the game.
---
I was pretty stuck between Warrior/Rogue but I might end up going Rogue
---
You can always win in 1v1. But in an even game with similar performing players warrior will lose pretty much every matchup the majority of the time.
---
Simple rule of thumb:
---
Your warrior is a wrecking ball if you got great gear and a dedicated healer in your back. 
---
Don’t have those requirements? You’ll probably have a hard time.
---
Maybe you're right, but in that case it'd be a nice compromise to have an option that would allow people to toggle having darker nights.
---
But you don’t lose your friends list, ability to pop back in to live and usefulness of experience. The barrier for Classic is much lower than any other MMO. Not saying you’re wrong, but it’s a bit different from your standard WoW killer
---
Gotta love watching your mage rival pop arcane power and icy veins right when a fight mechanic is about to stop them chaining frostbolts
---
He's an Alliance player. Doubt people actually took offense to the joke itself, but more the fact that he's an obvious Alliance player. Horde will players will downvote him.
---
Alliance making excuses as how garbage Horde are, when they in fact have advantages in battlegrounds, yet lose consistently lose.
---
Hey, I'm just kidding guys, please, Alliance players, don't get salty at me. See^what^I^did^there?
---
No idea how you can know that number.
---
Godwin's law only applies to references to hitler or nazis.
---
and it was perfectly on topic. pservers are entirely riddled with neonazis.
---
Ye, i forget the timezone but its either 10 or 12 for you over there, its 6am for me teehee
---
It seems crazy but I totally understand wanting to spend so much money to "complete" your recipe book. I had many times where I was very tempted to spend all of my gold on the Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok Chops book as it was the only one I needed to know every Cooking recipe. There's totally a market for people like that.
---
Interesting, TIL. I never played Hunter. I just assumed their pets were garbage until TBC made them not die and remembering how often they had to be rezzed in Vanilla raids.
---
Good idea.  We actually have a third friend (ud priest) who will be playing closely.  One tailor sounds good and definitely cover the three gathering.
---
Thats why im playing on a pve server so i can maximize my playtime, without getting ganked while farming or with world buffs.
---
seemed that way, yeah. is going to be one of the biggest perks of classic: being a nazi is against TOS.
---
classic is so much easier then people are making it out to be. The average player base skill level is so much more then 04. Most people played on 200 ms. 10 fps.  Times have changed. We have people doing SM full clears at 30 already
---
I wish that video about a guy playing wow with a toaster was real
---
No, it's possible. They had multiple hunters, which are conveniently able to ignore half the things that make hitting high level npcs hard.
---
she prefers the pvp aspect of ud and the cosmetics over troll :0
---
During vanilla? Vanilla wasn't "figured out" during vanillas life cycle. There is a big difference between the average roster make up in 2005 and 2006 and the average roster make up of the 2010s till present on pservers. It is kind of hard to argue that the majority of guilds that raided didn't raid "hardcore", they did it for fun. Guilds were born and guilds died through the entirety of vanillas life cycle. I think there is this idea that vanilla was hardcore and all raiding guilds were hardcore progressive during vanilla. That is not even close to accurate and I highly doubt that will be accurate when classic releases. 
---
It's not like druid tanks didn't raid, it's not like balance druids didn't raid, it's not like enh/ele shamans didn't raid, it's not like SP's didn't raid, it's not like ret pally's didn't raid. Of course they all did. Of course hundreds upon hundreds of guilds raided for fun and had pretty non standard (by pserver standards) rosters. 
---
If honestly think this dude won't be able to raid because he is a SP, you are out of your mind.
---
pretty easy to tell if a priest is shadow... they wouldn't have many holy and discipline abilities.. you didn't really think this one through did you?
---
Hey thanks for this insight! I appreciate it!
---
The worst part is that we will never experience the level 30 meta. Treating Scarlett Monestary as Black Rock Spire, and building BiS to raid Uldaman.
---
I assume it wont be hard to build balance gear with the items no one else needs in raids. Only people I'll be competing with for spell dmg leather are shamans building ele sets. And it's not like i'd be respeccing everyday. 4 (twice back and fourth) times a week is feasible considering the farm options available to druids.
---
Needs rgb
---
Forsaken also only have two available epic mounts compared to everyone else's three.
---
They made their own content.
---
true! thoughts and prayers always works
---
But... Why, how? What is this called in-universe so I can read about it? Really didn't think Warhammer was like that.
---
oh really? i'll have to test in the stress test. if that deathwarp doesn't work that's bad news for the orc but great for my levelling route :P
---
avoidance and mend being a hot rather than channel made it a lot easier for them to live in tbc, but if your healers are healing your pet (they should be) and you can micro it properly to get it out of any mechanics, your pet can be pretty survivable in raids
---
gg
---
You must choose Horde. Besides that, play what you like. Enjoy!
---
You're going to buy gold, in classic? How does that even work? And how ashamed are you to admit it?
---
Thanks heaps, I was at work and therefore not thinking and for some reason thought that we'd be the 26th when the US is the 27th...
---
Yeah needing a healer kind of sucks as a Warrior, same with getting super kited. Thanks for the input
---
That's perfect,  thank you. Very helpful
---
This title almost made me think this had never happened before! :D
---
They don't have to go for a full clear.
---
Shame they can't 10 man it.
---
&gt; Pretty sure Brady Games got their info from the developer directly.
---
No, they often didn't, they had writers who compiled info from internal players. BradyGames (and Prima) had serious inaccuracy issues over their history because of this, BradyGames notorious MGS3 Kerotans guide in their special edition $40 guide was a travesty.
---
You realize Unarmored mounts exist because they never finished the models right?
---
Yes, I agree. But in a typical Horde raid, shamans outnumber everyone? I'm not a healer, so I haven't really payed attention that much
---
Is that guy an Ironman?
---
22 y/o 6.2  male and i still sitt like gollum at my pc, some things never change
---
Another thing is most people on the beta seriously know their shit about wow as most are prolific players. Which is leading them to do ridiculous things such as SM Cath at level 30
---
Just make sure you record it to Toto's Africa.
---
God dayum that ending bit. I'm sitting here at 3AM at my computer listening to that and staring blankly into my screen. Think I'll go have an existential crisis now. Thank you sir.
---
Taking eight days off
---

---
I'm sorry what ? Are we reading the same subreddit ?
---
Hey its working great thanks for the link.
---
Hmm cant remember are there any size buffs that are not self-use consumables?  Like a reverse goblin shrink ray?  If so that could explain that maybe?  I personally remember a tauren warrior being the size of a molten giant back when all the size increases stacked (with about 100 horde streaming in behind him).
---
pretty sure all healers are welcome in their full raid specs, since they are pretty rare in pvp
---
I love Eastern Plaguelands, but I know nothing about it. I just love being there at 60
---
Retail failed purely because of this
---
While leveling?.. Audio books.. Not gonna listen to much music.. Audio books are the new hit for me when leveling, I highly recommend you try it.
---
Its gonna be Warrior Mage and Rogue in top three. Priest is popular, but not top 3.
---
The theorycrafting has restricted the viable specs, it didn't increase them.
---
Once phase2 starts layering will be gone and we will have queue timers.
---
True.
---
Vanilla.
---
Experiance.
---
And Im fine with that.
---
Det stemmer! :)
---
Entry level trolling, the entire thread takes the bait. Jesus.
---
I think wow released in China when 1.4 dropped or just after. Pre 1.4 wouldn't really have anything to do with China no?
---
Since this is still beta there’s a high chance that threat is still being tuned and will swing drastically in the upcoming weeks as the finishing touches are implemented.
---
Human Priest, Dwarf Hunter, Night Elf Rogue, Gnome Warlock, Orc Warrior, Undead Mage, Tauren Druid, Troll Shaman.
---
Wtf, I believe you're exaggerating and over reacting lol
---
The axe is just better. Whirlwind is also an instant attack. Yeah you can multikite if you want.
---
Sweeping strikes and cleave is all about burst damage which the axe is far better at.
---
Yeah, you want a shaman in every single group for windfury/mana regen buffs. Priests have more raw healing, but way less utility and aoe healing. Meanwhile Shamans just spam lowish rank chain heal and upkeep totems and call it a day.
---
Yukui in wow classic beta works almosy perfect for me. The only issue I have is not being able to make chat bigger and hide some stuff.
---
RemindMe!
---
The retard fest in this thread is quite amusing.
---
You should play whatever you feel like.
---
you will not , because no matter the dmg, its taking a debuff slot
---
It should not be a problem imo. Play what you like.
---
Shamans and Paladins are at the top if you look on each faction. Shamans are often more popular than Warriors on Horde in many surveys.
---
Do you always walk in circles because your left leg is always bend?
---
Oh I did. But you are assuming people are actually looking at which spells u used and which buff you applied, which wasn't always the case, especially in MC.
---
I don't really think the private server have had any effect either. And if they have, it might just make it harder as some think private servers are easier than classic servers (i.e. mobs hitting harder in classic).
---
I do belive most combinations of classes and roles have been tested during vanilla. That being said, every minor variation from vanilla they do when remaking classic would surely open up new possibilities. Gamers are
---
Quest that are working for me I classic beta right now - tukui, vendor price, questie, cartographer (I will check what are the other i am using after work)

Viable, not optimal. Prot pally's lack of taunt makes them pretty much a no go in 40 man's for obvious reasons (shaman tank too I guess). Other than that, you can raid whatever. The irony is the amount of users in this sub that state raids are going to be a steamroll in classic, and at the same time say some classes are not viable.
---
You're not planning to be 60 after four days of playing?
---
This sub really got overrun by casuals lately. SMH
---
Idk about that incident, but check out his YouTube channel with years worth of vanilla content and his Classic Podcast with developers and influential people from classic wow history. But I guess youre right.
---
1g, if the mage has to come from another city/place to you maybe 1.5 or 2.
---
But 90% of the time its 1g.
---
Rexxar and Arthas campaings is the best!
---
You probably think the ok gesture is a white power symbol.
---
You see, for adult it doesn't matter if it's summer or not. You take vacation whenever you feel like it. Some prefer summer, other people like winter and other don't care, just want to play the game they were waiting for 10 years or so. It doesn't matter if it's summer or not, I still have to go to job, pay my bills, keep my house clean and cook my own meals. Responsibilities are not magically escaping once summer hits. It's sunnier, hotter and overall more enjoyable so it's good idea to take a break off work for two or three weeks in this season but it doesn't mean I can't have my classic when summer hits. You've got issuses by telling other people that they can't have other priorities and if their priorities are wrong / worse than yours. Grow up and let people enjoy what they want to ffs.

---
Think prot pally was the fucking bomb in Wrath, Cata or MoP, can’t remember which. It would be top of damage, top of healing, all while carrying flag in WSG. 
---
God damn I miss random low level stuff being overpowered.
---
I'm a bit sad about ThreatMeter/DBM/Questie. But, well, they were here during Vanilla.
---
I hope we won't get retail QoL throught addons. Even if they are optionnals, they aren't about comfort anymore they are assisting us. A boss fight without KTM+DBM could be totally different.
---
Perhaps i just don't want the same gameplay as everyone :(
---
Yes, it would be extremely difficult. If you do not want to ever heal, no guild will let you raid. If you are willing to be a sort of hybrid that fills in as a healer or dps depending on which is needed for the week, you can probably find a casual guild. But since it sounds like you don't want to heal at all just roll a Warlock.
---
What's the point in spending 21 pts in fury when you wont deal any damage anyway?
---
Human Paladin, Night Elf Druid, Dwarf Priest, Gnome Mage.  
---
Tauren Warrior, Undead Rogue, Orc Warlock, Troll Shaman/Hunter.
---
Was anyone else annoyed that he didn't have Mage Armor applied?
---
How will they keep the game alive and Update it? Wont it die after a year if there’s no expansions coming?
---
Put down the logic mister and no one will get hurt
---
Yeh but I do lose my invincibles reins, my ashes of alar, my warglaives etc etc etc. it definitely keeps people from leaving.
---
What
---
Lmao im glad you liked it dude. His voice lines are truly phenomenal.
---
Oh plz
---
I rock that hair style on my Frost DK. Love it
---
Tauren Druid (for that 5% total Health)
---
Night Elf Hunter (for those Shadowmeld ganks)
---
Gnome Mage (for that 5% Intelligence)
---
Dwarf Priest (for that OP Fear Ward)
---
Orc Rogue (Blood Fury is good, but I mainly just don't want to be an Alliance rogue getting my stuns resisted)
---
Troll Shaman (I guess Beserking is good, but I mainly just couldn't pick anything else)
---
Undead Warlock (again, no other choice)
---
Human Warrior (for that +5 mace and sword skill)
---
Skip: Paladin, fuck EVER leveling a Paladin again. Also the only class with just one viable spec.
---
200ms damn that would have been amazing, 550ms from Australia :(. It’s going to be so different in classic just taking into account the no lag change.
---
Assuming their buffs are covered, I'd bring empty slots over those bad specs, they really are *that* bad.
---
Honestly who besides Asmondgold has a god complex persona?
---
My dude so my plan is to play rogue either human or orc I will see on a pvp server. The ideea is that I will not have a lot of time on my hands to play so I will mostly be working on professions and world questing. No dungeons or raids. Maybe some bgs. Rogue is nice since you can hide from getting ganked and also you can help others being ganked.
---
Green Skeletal Warhorse is the pre-1.4 UD mount :)

---
This is correct. They changed it as every 10th level usually gives your character a major improvement in some sort. Level 40 is mount and level 30 is bottom of talent tree.
---
Warrior. The apparently anti rogue in pvp but then my overpower always misses somehow and then I'm stunned forever somehow also and then dead
---
Exactly! I started in late wotlk and didn't hit max level until cata.
---
Not sure if I'll have that same sense of wanderlust but I'm hype nonetheless.
---
I see it as my chance to make/be a part of a brand new version of history. Not sure if that makes sense but that's roughly how I feel.
---
Wait you changed it from F. I can't remember what I had it as but I assume it was F. Why did you change it?
---
My 1st ever toon was a Dwarf rouge...

All of those put Paladin/Shaman at the bottom (except one that also puts Druid down there).
---
Oh man, this kinda thing would be good for an fps.
---
Guys, why is my pee pee getting big and hard?
---
I'd say most of them as it really is part of the game in vanilla. End game is fun, but reaching 60 takes so much longer than retail so you better have some fun on your journey
---
Of course not, I was giving rough stat values in terms of AP.
---
Correction: they are both adding and removing... keep in mind Classic runs on the 7.1.5 engine and needs to be customized to look like 1.12.1.
---
Thus my question is quite relevant as it concerns if they have removed the newer emblem/icons or reduced those to 1.12.1 as well or not.
---
Envious of what ? a fool who claims to know things and when caught tries to play it off....
---
If all you can do is lie once caught then you should honestly consider getting a life as you desperately need it...
---
Same, I was 7 when my dad got WoW and now that im 21 it feels like ill be able to fully experience what the game has to offer, instead of just running around killing shit on my hunter til bed time after school every day
---
Stop crying like a little B and stop playing the game if you don't like it. Come back with classic and get your nostalgia glasses blown away after dying the 23rd time from god damn murlocs pulling each other while running away in god damn Elwynn Forest.
---
Not rly ive been there, after 2-3 months raiding, they are all tilted 0 dkp cuz all the items they have and i havent taken any, the  rly good dagger from cthun drops and i dumb as much as i can for it haha :p
---
Is it me or was the 2 hunter marks stacking on top of each other?
---
Those “tricks” may or may not work on classic
---
I was standing in the inn, when in came one of the gnomes named Babey, followed by another one saying, "Die!", followed by dwarf telling the gnome named Babey to "stop being such a Babey". Then, another came in, and another, and another, and more, and more, until it led to this... 
---
I'm grateful to have witnessed this.
---
Well, I'd say engineering is best if you're into PVP. You need other professions if you're heavy on the PvE part. For example dragonscale leatherworking for raiding in MC and BWL
---
So your saying that the assumption should be that nobody is ever a Nazi? 
---
If it talks like a duck and acts like a duck I’m not going to assume it’s just a fish trying to be edgy I’m going to say, look that’s a fucking duck.
---
I don't see what's so peculiar. Looks like a normal gathering of amish to me.
---
You got a point there, indeed during beta things will vary quite a bit so ill wait a few months to ask this question :)
---
This is also true.
---
Even back in vanilla it was hard to get 40 ppl to raid, so many ppl needed. So if you are a body that is willing to show up every raid you will be ok aslong as its not a tryhard guild. Biggest problem is getting gear for a lot of offspecs.
---
Hopefully Grid will return again. It was my favorite add-on in vanilla.
---
Not as also true as yo momma!

If the content is on farm, sometimes guilds will take them.  Also they might take them as a carry.  They can get spots in some guilds even but generally not "competitive ones." 
---
If your question is "do they contribute enough to warrant the raid spot on progression content?" the answer is no.  The potential caveat is a feral druid because they can offtank pretty well, and they can MT some fights just fine, and as feral you can do decent though not competitive dps.  
---
I think a good estimate of things like enhance shaman, shadow priest, and Ret Paladin are like 40-50% of the dps of a decent rogue/warrior/mage/warlock.
---
probably true, but even for pve engi is still bis since it offers sooo much
---
Huh. I actually played on Alliance on Twilight's Hammer...
---
Good bot.
---
Good words, human
---
Nope, play whatever you want. Unless you plan on being a serverfirst/worldrank raider that want to be in the Top guilds. But non top-guilds can clear all content aswell.
---
I read a lot of people claim they actually scaled really poorly, so they were alright in mc but would just fall off hard in aq/naxx... It was just forum chatter, no real source. Was that just bs, then? Why would they change, anyway, don't they use the same gear all the other healers use, i.e. mostly cloth?
---
I did read that on what rhymes with coastalius (probably other pservers too), they ended up playing resto druids mostly as raid healers using regrowth, which only worked because people were killing bosses so much faster than in '05. Using nature's grace you'd have procs (on crits..?) that gave you faster healing touch casts too, so the playstyle kind of revolved around that mechanic. You could also spec into swiftmend for more of a tank healer thing.
---
Healing touch would be better if fights got longer and you ran the risk of actually going oom in aq/naxx, but on that server they never came out, and people also had doubts whether there would really be such a big step up.
---
Any insight on that?
---
Also, are they crap for 5mans? The *one* resto druid I actually played with on statoilius I brought for a strat undead run, but he was kind of outgearing it hard, so hard to get perspective... I'm just wondering if they are wonky even disregarding the lack of ress, which admittedly is an inconvenience no matter how effective they are.
---
Could you enlighten me about any of this? I think I'll play hpala, but I am curious about druids. They seem fun, but I'm a little scared of putting my eggs in a shit basket.
---
I know some people can do crazy things in PvP with druids, but that's not really reason enough for me by itself. I might not even get good enough to do any of that even if I tried.
---
Sorry for wall of text. Appreciate any help.
---
Paladins, Shamans, Druids - yep, they're healers and buffers. They can't tank nearly as well as Warriors and have about 1/10th the DPS of other classes.
---
Mage - they only go Frost for MC and BWL because the mobs are immune to Fire. In AQ and beyond, they go Fire. Arcane just goes OOM.
---
Priest - One Disc Priest for Divine Spirit is good. One Shadow Priest for Shadow Weaving (assuming your raid has a lot of Warlocks) is okay. Your damage and mana regen will suck though.
---
Most of the other pure DPS classes (Hunter, Rogue, Warlock) have a couple viable specs, but there's always one that's best for PVE.
---
That's the thing I love the most... We can choose the fights!
---
If I see I can't keep up on PVE I'll just do pvp.. since with 2 or 3 hours daily I think it's possible to be rank 9 or 10...
---
Anyone know if there's a simple Druid mod out there to show our mana bar while in bear or kitty forms?
---
I assume you mean, "Optimal, not viable."
---
Everything is VIABLED.  Not everything is OPTIMAL.  You can bring Enhance/Elemental Shamans, Ret Paladins, Boomkins/Feral Druids.  But  Mages, Rogues, Warlocks, and Warriors being play sub-optimally, will do just the same, if not more, then the hybrids;. which must do everything at their disposal to get the same value.
---
You need to double the votes of shaman/paladin to account for the fact that they are faction locked.
---
When they put out the beta, the build was updated to use 8.0.1, it was still in the .tocs before they were re-versioned. OP is 100% correct.
---
THAT IS AMAZING BRO!!! Would you sell it? I would absolutely hang it on my wall if you do 😁
---
Windfury Totem?
---
Rexxar was my inspiration to roll hunter my first time around. Looking forward to seeing him in game
---
They should make a porn flick starring Edwina VanQueef.
---
Yes youmightbe right
---
If she has a problem with my gaming rig I'll show her the door myself.
---
You mean non meta SPECS. Not classes.
---
But yes, they are unplayable in raids. Blizzard didn't make every spec to shine in raids back in vanilla.
---
Eh, mage is only frost in MC/BWL because mobs have higher than average fire resistance. In ZG, AQ20/40, Naxxramas mages should play fire because those mobs have higher than average frost resistance*
---
*Viscidus excluded
---
On the whole though, yes, the reason cookie cutter/meta specs exist is because the "off-meta" specs, or non cookie cutter talent trees are just not as competitive.
---
I tried using bagnon earlier and just got lua errors, so I don't think everything tagged as updated is actually compatible yet.
---
Take it you never did Onyxia without a dwarf priest?
---
Isn't the whole point of a Feral Druid to not heal?
---
It's the *only* good starting point. :)
---
&gt;This
---
There is nothing wrong with a LFR addon
---
Sweet! Poster du den serveren her også? 
---
Eventuelt blir det annonsert på discord et sted hvor det står permanent? Vi er en god gjeng fra KRS som skal begynne!
---
No. OP asked if classes where unplayable. All classes are viable, not optimal. Except for a tank who can't taunt in 40's.
---
With some of the bugs that are in there right now.
---
I'm really glad August isn't now honestly. I don't want another rushed release from Blizzard.
---
If hunters can't even auto shot sometimes because it gets glitched, there's serious fucking problems and it's not even close to being ready.
---
I'm curious, since I would call myself pretty knowledgeable about Vanilla. Why can't they start raiding as Shadow in Classic? To my understanding, it's the 16 debuff limit only being introduced later in the ZG patch, which holds guilds back from using 1 Shadow Priest. So with Classic having 16 debuff slots from the start, what is it? You usually bring enough Warlocks, even for entry raids, for Shadow Vuln. to make up for lost DPS of the Shadow Priest.
---
I hope you get banned within the first day of buying gold. You are the reason so many peoples accounts got hacked back in the day.
---
You usually finish Silverpine around 16-17 with a breadcrumb quest to go to the barrens, which also happens to be a good level to do RFC, so you can still do Barrens while starting in the undead zone.
---
Richard is currently sitting on my mantlepiece. :D
---
You’ll last about 5 minutes until you’re globally muted, but you’ll show them who’s edgier in that 5 minutes I bet.
---
Yes its subscription based :)
---
What do you mean benefits? Economically? No.
---
Watch there be lvl 30 cap private servers in the near future
---
Icy veins?
---
Ah, now I understand. Why do so many players want to roll dress wearing healbots?!
---
Berserking is a haste buff and it's not even a flat number. It should go from 10% to 25% IIRC depending on the users health at activation.
---
Tranq shot and extra early threat for tanks, that's all a hunter kind of is made for in raiding unfortunetly ^^ But you still need 1-2 of them, preferably 2 if one hunters tranq shot fails.
---
Are you familliar with classic wow man ?
---
What is its lvl cap and end game content for non raiders?
---
all cities fucking suck from horde...
---
OG fucking ugly labrinth xD
---
undercity ??? 
---
thunder bluff anyoing af
---
Pro tip: Move with ESDF instead of WASD. Frees up extra (convenient) keys.
---
I only ever played Alliance until the shitty faction changes were introduced. (I'm against paid transfers as a whole as they destroy server communities)
---
I do however remember getting walked up to in AV by shamans with the unstoppable force and just losing my HP bar.
---
Is the patch Classic is launching on have the version of windfury where it can proc from it's procs?
---
Or does it have an ICD to prevent that?
---
Jokes on you, we LOVE dying to Murlocs!
---
The pet is far from useless though.
---
But yes you get no aoe reduction whichs means as a hunter you have be careful how to utilize your pet, which adds a lot of depth to the class, though granted vanilla has limited boss mechanics so often you can just send it in and afk. Pets when done correctly does still contribute 15-25% dps, that's far from useless.
---
Yeah it’s sad they’ve never managed to replicate that. I don’t know where the fault lies though. Expansion packs would’ve had to of been entirely new games to rival the vanilla experience. Not just 10 levels and some more factions / dungeons / raids.
---
But aren't there qiraji in ungoro crater?
---
Level cap is 60
---
End-game content is lots of dungeons and of course PVP. 
---
There's also more casual raids that you can particpate in, these are 20 man raids with a 3 day reset timer, so they are often pugged.
---
AFAIK SoC works on proc per minute, so you don't gain any damage by using faster weapons.
---
That's Troll racial berserking, not WSG berserking.
---
He says it like all pservers are the same. Good ones don't have this problem whatsoever.
---
4 the hord
---
Haha absolutely! Unless you really enjoy the support playstyle Paladin is a drag.
---
That's what i thought.  what you said just sounded weird in my head.
---
Spamming decurse will get you re-invited to raids every time, regardless of your dps.
---
Benefits are that its fun
---
Level cap is 60, and for non raiders there's very little: 5 man dungeons or UBRS, instanced PvP where you will be dominated by people in raid gear and world PvP where you will be dominated by people in raid gear. 
---
Honest opinion. Classic WoW was always raid or die.
---
Yeah it’s funny
---
There are years worth of content patches already made for Classic. They've also said in interviews that they are open to creating new content if there is a large demand for it.
---
no need to, the enemies would go down so much quicker and pet would do tanking
---
&gt; Slower weapon = more dps
---
yeah you skipped several steps in that equation...
---
Tfw you need 400g at lvl 40.
---
Empty raid slots are viable
---
So they just make raids longer/harder
---
You can raid even in a good guild...If you take no loot prio. Otherwise you're begging for anarchy in your 40 man guild. That or there was already anarchy before ret palas were introduced to the mess
---
What race you find best suited?
---
That's correct. Maybe you should specify what you're talking about, as I'm probably not the only one to think of the racial instead of some PvP buff. You were going on about how it's a DPS loss and the place where we concern ourselves with measuring DPS is usually not a battleground.
---
Hey its me your guilds shaman. Giv sulfaras plox
---
This is not true for Feral Druid. The theorycrafting has actually left Feral dps and tanking in a very favorable light in the private server community.
---
That being said I think the Classic attitude will be more relaxed and we will see a lot more non-optimal specs.
---
Great replies, I think it will be very very popular in the first 3 months, What do you think ? also it will take long to lvl ? also are there any changes or somewhere that i can check on "patch notes" for classic wow ?
---
A MMO PvE elements are dangerous.  It's a really retro idea.
---
Sorry, I said class, but meant obviously SPECS. Of course all classes are playable.
---
Exactly
---
Chill buddy, it was a friendly race, no need to take it so seriously lol.
---
You can raid MC as a fire mage it’s fine.
---
\^ This!
---
No, just silithid, the non-sentient worker slaves and they’re only able to make a den at the very southern edge, away from the three Power Crystal Pylons and the Titan Observatory (you don’t get to see the Observatory until WotLK, it’s way up high in the north).
---
We've already made it a full week since release date announcement. Time is going to start flying by. Stay strong!
---
With 1.12 talents it won't be too bad.  Now getting those warriors to actually tank is  much, much bigger problem.
---
I'll be for sure orc or undead... But I prefer orc... The racial is so much strong in pvp! Female just because of the size 😂
---
Link?
---
The raids are a steamroll because people don’t play bad specs.
---
&gt; there's a massive difference between mediocre kiting and masterful kiting
---
No worries - after a few goes kiting General Drakkisath in UBRS you get the hang of it.
---
Warlocks start off slow and inconsistent, since, unlike mages, they don't have any talents that give them +hit to their primary skill (Shadowbolt is a destruction spell, so Suppression doesn't work).  Once they get gear, they start to take off, especially around ZG when they can can get Bloodvine set; shadow priest being able to put Shadow Weaving helps them a lot too.
---
Hunters DPS is pretty good early on, as they are less reliant on +hit than melee, but they don't scale nearly as well, and can have mana issue on prolonged fights.  They essentially become kiters and enrage dispellers later on, or if they get a Nightfall and Wing Clip spam.
---
Rogues all want to go swords spec, but some have to go dagger spec so all the rogues aren't constantly fighting over every sword that drops.
---
Dont think this would be even equivalent to Mythic +10 dungeon tbh
---
Roll a dice. Then if you dont like what you get... re-roll. Personally.. Im gonna roll a mage because  thats what I rolled last time.  :D
---
THANK YOU
---
fucking clanmanmode.
---
I used to consider them free honor before they got deathcoil.  How the worm has turned.
---
Classic will eat the retail player base regardless, retail players who return to play classic won’t return to BFA when they get bored.
---
&gt; raid or die
---
No, not really. Of the 7-8 million people that played Vanilla WoW, only 1% of them raided.
---
Did he make any excuses? All I saw was that they gave it their best effort and failed... They did pretty good for most of it as well, until they messed it up.
---
Yes, I meant specs. Sorry for the typo, corrected everywhere (but in title).
---
Hello friend! They will only update to fix bugs that were not present in the original 1.12 patch. Other than that the there will not be updates. The classic game offers many years of gameplay for most players that like that state of the game, where the exception is the hard core players that run trough all raids with ease. But back in the day  about 1% off all players managed to clear Naxx, so even if many more do it in classic, the servers will offer us casuals the option to take our time to "get good". 
---
And it stays alive with the players that do not want anything more after 1.12. Just like the p-servers have stayed alive for a decade.
---
It's fixed on the proper ones? Oh I didn't know.
---
I'm really concerned about how fast Blizz will release its late game content. I really want to take my time to lvl up, and at the same time I Don't want to be late to the end game party.  
---
I have a friend that will lvl up 2 characters, one he will paly with us, slowly, and another one he will rush to 60 for the end game content.  
---
I'm not sure I have that strength
---
Kult! Det enkleste er nok å joine serveren. Der vil den stå permanent. Men, blir nok postet litt andre steder også.
---
Feral is actually a legit tank.
---
Especially since it has such a fast weapon swing, really good weapon. Better than the thrash blade, as long as your skill in 1h axes is high enough ;)
---
Nostalgia
---
Hunters will be very popular.  Not at a end game, but in general.
---
I think that's the thing that a lot of people are failing to understand:
---
You can play whatever you want, but if the raid needs you to heal, or needs you to slap a shield on to off tank a mob, then you better be prepared to swap or else the raid will find someone else who will.
---
/s ?
---
Is there not a beta 2 with a wipe and new wave of players happening? Why not?
---
You could search for some class guides to see if one of the classes intrests you. Go play and once you are stuck on something look it up. If you hear people say stuff you dont understand look it up. Learning along the way is the way to go.
---
People would kill for a "blind" experience but we are curced by knowing to much already. 
---
Atleast we know the game is good.
---
Tried this once, failed miserably. There was 'sort of' a market, from multiple sellers, but way underpriced so I purchased all of the current market and relisted at a higher rate. I barely made back my money when they started relisting.
---
Made me speculate against counter-monopolizing auctioneers, having multiple alts, all listing the same material good at varying prices, dissuading potential auctioneers.
---
And PvP with hunters, and gank with Hunters, and farm with Hunters, etc.  Pretty much the perfect class if their DPS didn't drop off in AQ40.
---
Or half the non-shamna/paladin votes
---
Don’t worry about stuff like that, raids take lots of rouges, you will find a raid spot easily, I don’t think  anyone has ever reached 60 and been denied a raid spot, it may just take a bit longer to get gear but your guild will be gearing all 40 members up so you will get the gear eventually as long as you don’t burn out you’ll be fine
---
Many of us are playing on private servers and loving it..
---
I second that motion
---
I'm not sure where people get this idea that X and Y is an issue "on private servers", it's probably just their gut feeling that reality should be that way. Or maybe they just check out stock Mangos and infer that that's how all servers are.
---
This is what people said when they switched to OSRS. They never looked back.
---
Most trance now is just generic EDM.
---
I failed 3 years of exam and had to redo those years.  
---
So my school time management wasn't so good.  
---
Now i don't have any school anymore and a full time job :D
---
That's a good point of view... Never seen it that way...
---
Yeah that is true.
---
Idk I played a warrior a couple of times I always thought it was addictive but apparently it's multiplicative. Tbh I never actually checked lol.
---
Why do you hate polite cat
---
&gt; Rogues all want to go swords
---
Speak for yourself, I mained Rogue in Vanilla and passed on every sword over daggers. Seal Fate couldn’t be touched once you got enough crit and made for much better PVP.
---
You can play trial characters on inactive accounts. They can go up to level 20, but can't trade it use auction house.
---
If you forgot your login info and don't have access to the email address on the account, then contact Blizzard support.
---
Any active WoW account can play Classic once it comes out. It doesn't matter which expansions you own. It only has to be active.
---
I get that if you're correct, as a beginner, it's better to stick to meta specs in order to make mistakes less of a problem than if we were on an off-meta spec ? I planned on being paladin, but am not sure if healing is I'm gonna be good healer, tanking seems like a big job on WoW classic overall so I wanted to be DPS.
---
I like how you list aspects of why people like classic as reasons why people won’t like it.
---
Nobody is going to look forward to treadmill on bfa again once you have the rewarding gameplay of classic.
---
What everyone is trying(and failing) to say is that slow but hard hitting weapons are better because skills such as Mortal Strike or Whirlwind are limited by their own cooldowns, not the weapon attack speed itself, so they work especially well with said slow but hard hitting weapons.
---
Why is that the rule? I see far more tank and dps paladins than healer papas.
---
I mean, there is a pretty massive gap between steamrolling and constant wiping.
---
It really depends on your character. Some people can handle it pretty well, others get totally drawn in and start fucking up in school.
---
Time management was pretty easy. I successfully allocated my time based on a weighted efficiency and relevancy scale. Something like this:
---
* Exams &amp; assignments: 0%
---
* Wow: 90%
---
* Party: 10%
---
Don’t do this as a new player.
---
I recommend just jumping in completely fresh at release, those first few moments in the game are priceless.
---
Even an add-on wouldn't be useful here — the server never tells the client how much threat that the player has (at least it shouldn't, since it doesn't display threat as it does in Modern), and all threat add-ons were based on "known" values hardcoded into the add-on that it added to someone's threat whenever they used certain moves (and calculating it based on damage/healing for the appropriate skills).
---
I'll reiterate what everyone is saying, that you should play what ever you want.
---
Do bear in mind that rogue plays much different than the later iterations:  The majority of your damage come from white hits, and you spend most of your combo points the keep SnD up with the occasional Eviscerate.  Also, don't even think about using any poison other than Instant.
---
Returning retail players who will play classic won’t return to bfa once they get bored. Classic will permanently take a cut from bfa
---
Because every single one of those players made it to 60... ? And it is raid or die. Of those 7-8 million people, 99% of them got destroyed by the 1% of players in MC, BWL, AQ40 and Naxx gear.
---
This kind of challenge is basically what I wanted mythic dungeons to be (minus the glancing blows of course). AOE burning trash packs to beat a timer is such a give-up from blizzard.  Of course, at 60 there won't be anything like this in Classic either.
---
Under the hill?
---
The mages don’t need to be Frost for Viscidus. He just needs to be hit ~200 times with any frost attack to shatter. Rank 1 Frostbolt will do.
---
Play after you are done with your assignments and exams? Or when you know you have time to spare.
---
This type of bug definitely happened in Vanilla.
---
I could have done betto, we always can.
---
I did pretty bad at school, in general, at that time, and should have favored homework more than game time. Biggest mistake was to quit sports tho, it tipped the balance quite a bit.
---
I can only recommend that you balance out all the important stuff, and take it easy on classic
---
- play your games (whichever you feel like)
---
- make time for school and homework (it sucks, but make sure it's sorted before playing) 
---
- make time for social stuff and family (have an offline day) 
---
- get some proper sleep (google up your recommended duration and then stick to it) 
---
- have fun and adjust as you see fit - try to do your 'needs to do' before your 'wants to do'
---
Good luck!
---
It's a bit of a meme, but yeah, it can work in a lot of cases.  Warriors will still be the go-to, though.
---
There’s a setting for it in the TukUI settings on Retail. I’m not 100% sure where and I don’t play the game anymore so I can’t just hop on and check, but there’s a slider buried under a submenu somewhere that’s called like “Left Side Text Box Height” and there’s one for width as well.
---
You won’t like classic because I’m bad at mmorpgs :( stop having fun
---
What kind of people have you been raiding with, that you think Loot Council is about giving loot to the highest DPS on the meters? Don't blame the system for the behaviour of shitty people.
---
Please be cautious using this guide post level 30.  The majority of the guide is ripped straight from a speed run by VarrakWoW, who did the run on a private server using incorrect quest hand in values post level 30. 
---
The incorrect values equal to 30% more xp per quest hand for post level 30. Use it if you want, but just know speed levelers that have tested this guide that is otherwise quite good pre 30 know that the routes post 30 are far from optimal. 
---
Have you ever used a guide that says you should now be level 45 and you are only half way thru 44? That's this one for the later levels despite the authors claims that the modifications he made it fixes it.
---
Nice credit to Varrak BTW.
---
a certain number if hunters will be needed in raids due to trueshot aura and tranq shot. There a bit like shadow priests in that way, every team will want one or two but then it's a hard cap and no more will be needed.
---
Yes, I'm very excited cuz I've never played vanilla... I started on TBC, and this is going a discovery for me... I'll be so engaged with the game 😁😁
---
Oh sure, later on, Daggers spec is amazing.  But early into MC progression, swords out-perform daggers by a decent margin.
---
There should be. It's called "Region/Account"
---
Fuck I feel this so hard man. I've changed my mind at least 10 times in the past two weeks.
---
I'm sure I will continue going over each spec and class I would be interested in playing until classic eve and go with what I have then.
---
Or just buy one off AH cheap, since there will be hell a lot of them there at release ^^,
---
Dear god what a combo
---
Yeah same with Demon Hunters. Such a cool class and yet people just started playing them within the last few years.
---
Soda
---
It really isn’t. Feral tank is way more tps than a deep prot. So unless ur rocking fury dps tank in your raids it really is a great choice if you have a good one.
---
+1
---
I can't watch his life stuff, way too obnoxious.
---
I've save dthis for a watch later - Azoth was my go to for Vanilla druid pvp way back in the day. It's not as flashy or big crits as something like a Maydie video, but it definitely shows what it took to be good as a druid in pvp in vanilla.  
---
[https://youtu.be/MOYmUtlhiU4](https://youtu.be/MOYmUtlhiU4)
---
Speaking as a mage who raided in vanilla.... I never cared what other mages were doing. I never cared what anyone else was doing. I was playing to have fun. 
---
Good job I was never a raid leader I guess! :D
---
There’s streamers going around kharazhan and I saw one person wall jumping over Orgrimmar
---
Honored gives -10%. That is the only one.
---
Wat
---
You failed your intelligence roll.
---
And they're also communicating in Discord and being very coordinated. This is not your average dungeon group from trade chat.
---
That's my keybind for mounting
---
I 100% agree with you.
---
I bought this computer a couple months before WoW came out.
---
https://www.cnet.com/products/dell-dimension-2400-c-2-4-ghz-monitor-crt-17-series/
---
You're definitely remembering wrong if you think CRTs were rare or hard to find.
---
I saw a hunter in pure cloth with arcane dmg on all of it running around 1 shotting everyone with arcane shot once
---
There’s plenty of things to do in Vanilla WoW that aren’t raid, collect gear, show off said gear. It was very much about the journey and experiences along the way. By your own argument, those millions that never got to 60 never had raiding on their mind. Only in later expansions did raiding become so commonplace and necessary for a “true WoW experience”.
---
Besides, raiding is going to be much different this time around. It won’t be 3-5 nights a week, 3-5 hours a night. It’ll be 3-5 hours a week. You’re gonna have to figure out some other way to enjoy the game. For me, it’s being the first to reach the gold cap (without buying gold IRL).
---
&gt; I rock that hairstyle (cata bull shit) on my frost death knight (wotlk);
---
&gt; classic can’t come any sooner.
---
Wouldn't it be cool to form a guild of people who never played classic (or barely at all) and all experience it for the first time, not looking up boss tactics or what they do/you have to do, not looking up where you have to go for a quest but ask people in chat, not looking up the best leveling builds, not rushing to 60 etc etc?
---
I would really love to see this happening.
---
Hope you enjoy it, there has been nothing that compares to vanilla, since it became tbc
---
Will servers use 'sharding' like in retail?
---
One thing I miss is the sense of server community in retail due to Sharding.
---
It's the later patch 1.12. So I believe there's an internal cooldown of something like 3 seconds. But you can still get a proc from Hand of Justice or vice versa.
---
What is your problem with nazis?
---
You have to put in a LOT more work just to become average on the DPS charts.  It's possible, but very difficult.  In the end, it's all about what your raid will allow.  If they let you go Ret, then by all means, go for it!
---
Also, Holy Paladin healing is by far the easiest healing in the game.  You are primarily the tank healer, so you really only have to pay attention to a few frames.   You have near-infinite mana, as Flash of light crits will refund you their base mana back.  The hardest part of Holy Pally is rebuffing every other pull and being forced to wear a dress since there isn't a lot of good healing plate.
---
**THOMAS THE RAP ENGINE**
---
The gnomes dont look very happy to be there
---
This is not correct. They've already stated that slow releases of certain content will come out in waves as the game progresses.
---
Guilds don’t need a deep Prot tank except for a few fights (and Druid definitely isn’t tanking those). Most pservers run a Fury tank.
---
A guild is gimping itself if it uses a Druid MT over a Warrior. It has no advantages and plenty of disadvantages.
---
That’s simply because there aren’t any good daggers until the end of MC...
---
Kiting Drakkisath is super easy though.
---
Bear tanks meme-status is really just a holdover from vanilla, 15 years ago.  Near the end of vanilla, players were just starting to come around on Bear tanks, and the recent PServer community sold it on a lot of people.
---
But bears are still a meme.  Not that's it's a bad thing.
---
Orc / nightelf hunter
---
Undead / gnome frostmage
---
Soda is absolutely convinced that powershifiting IS SUPER STRONG, but I'm not sure I saw it.
---
Unless you're comparing it to single player games, WoW was definitely considered casual, even by 2004 standards.
---
WoW was considered much easier than any other MMO that existed at the time. Everquest, Eve, UO, FFXI were all *substantially* more difficult and forgiving than WoW was. WoW definitely had the stigma of being 'baby's first MMO' when it came out. 
---
Make no mistake, I absolutely love WoW and am not shitting on it but there's no doubt that it was much easier than other MMOs of its time.
---
Alright, I'll keep that in mind, thank you
---
The new mounts use the exact same model lmao
---
I'm a try that, it will take some getting used to timing that between auto shots.
---
Salvation has never been a prot talent. Are you thinking of Kings?
---
you couldn't access them at all until cataclysm flying came in. And I bet my ass off that blizz will keep it the same this time around.
---
Also the Classic client is locked to DX11 so even if they already had those patches - could be hard to use.
---
I'd say most people actually.
---
For group pvp, all normal raid specs for priest are decent in pvp.
---
Very much false. Wall jumping and other glitches made reaching these areas and many more possible.
---
There is very little reason to use fixed version of the client. They said they want it to work now and in 15 years. Staying with fixed version means that if retail changes something to the infrastructure they now have to manage two different infrastructures for current and constantly aging Classic version. If you keep both clients on the same codebase they are always in sync with any changes and fixes.
---
Can't be done sadly. No way to check if a player interrupts a spell as far as I'm aware.
---
Think of it as a primer for kiting, it's the place where many hunters learn the basics -spin shooting, trapping, avoiding hazards, constrained environment etc etc
---
Spin-shooting over the bridge without falling off and jumping the fire into the beast room without getting stunned are foundational abilities
---
Ima be honest I don't understand this and your ELI5 made me even more confused
---
True; Core Hound Tooth off Majordomo, and Perdition's Blade from Rag, in case anyone else was wondering.
---
But dat Barman Shanker, tho.
---
Best time ever. Hope you enjoy it. It truly is something special and magical.
---
No. They implemented a system called layering which basically splits up your realm into three different "shards" - one layer will hold up to 3k players and you are only supposed to be able to switch between them by getting an invite from a friend from another layer.
---
They put it in place in order to survive the onslaught of people at the beginning and to avoid empty servers down the line - so if half of all people on a realm stop playing, you can just merge the layers after a certain time and have a well populated server still. 
---
It's supposed to only be in place for as long as they need it, and will leave the game after phase 1 at the latest.
---
Are you aware of what happened in Europe during the 1930's and 40's?
---
I’d say hunter has a higher ceiling. The difference between a bad and a very good hunter is crazy.
---
i didn't  manage anything. Basicly threw away 4 years of school. But hey, at least I got up untill Sapphiron amirite? In all seriousness: I did poorly at school mainly because of WoW. Looking back at it, it was worth it. But it could've gone way different had I managed my time between WoW and school better.
---
A lot of it is that we all have WAAAYY better internet now with 30-50ms, compared to back in 2005 when we were all rocking 200-300ms+ connections.
---
You’re clearly not a developer. Technical debt is a constant war within departments. Usually the business decision is “if it works now and you don’t have definitive proof it won’t work later, we’re not upgrading it”. Blizzard has shown they want to save as much money developing and running Classic as possible, it’s the entire reason they’ve added loot-trading.
---
This is getting repetitive
---
That's literally entry level easy mode kiting. It sounds like you're attempting to make fun of me by assuming something like that is what I was referring to with masterful kiting.
---
I was rather talking about something like kiting the duo final boss of Dire Maul, King Gordok and the mage Cho'rush the Observer at the same time and killing Gordok completely solo. This is quite challenging, I don't think there is anything any other class is capable of that is as difficult.
---
Stoned alone in this.
---
Then let me have a edit:
---
 you couldn't access them LEGITIMATELY at all until cataclysm flying came in.
---
You really need that /s, huh?
---
Ok, brill. Thanks
---
Blizzard games consistently are my most played games, but never once have I been able to play them launch day. Their release dates have just always been so damn inconvenient for me.
---
tbh this is awesome, if played a warrior id buy one of these aswell for lols.
---
Batman Shanker was brilliant until they normalized weapon speed. I solo’d BRD so many times for it so I could switch to daggers only to get Perdition’s a couple weeks later.
---
"HolY ShIeeT DaT guY iS inSaAaAnE! DoEs hE hAve ThREEE ArMs or sOmeThiNg?"

---
Wait times ? No thanks. I’m for crossrealm bgs and that’s how it was in 1.12. #nochanges
---
That's not what this post is about?
---
I was working at the time, playing till 3am and then needing to leave the house at 7:30am was not advisable. Got that 8/8 T2 though so who really won?
---
I feel like many, many people excited for WoW classic were that 11 year old idiot. I know I was. Am a proud 20-something idiot now, though, and ready to go.
---
You can just walk to karazan and see it.

Is it possible to create two letter character name in Beta?
---
Confusing post
---
Would have to be a life changing amount for me (and I live a decent life in Germany), no joke. I’m so looking forward to this game.
---
OK, so even with normalization, higher weapon damage still matters for certain abilities. Coolio :)
---
Shouldnt work like that in vanilla, the mobs should turn around walk away and turn back, or am i remembering wrong?
---
Hey Malorak on April 29, 2019 at 4:15 p.m. eastern. you said quote, "Prolly will have its own subfee. If not, quote me on this and I'll put up a video of me levelling a warrior Tank on classic launch." here's a link to the image.
---

Yeup, I failed university
---
&gt;axe
---
The point is for warriors sword ability to get 5% double attack chance ontop of these weapons
---
This is what years of wow have done. There will be SO many players who believe worth is defined by a damage meter, and then wonder why they fail. Vanilla had hybrids and support classes. The 'Holy Trinity' was nowhere near as clear cut and defined as it is on modern wow now.
---
They're in Naxx gear lmao
---
Yeah, but the normalization was necessary due to how overpowered slow weapons were with instant attacks.  A level 50 dagger should not be better than a dagger that drops off of Rag.
---
tbh from what we have seen on beta no mob seems to hit very hard. Actually think its doable with the ledge bug if ranged can hit
---
True!
---
Your racials doesn't matter that much to be honest. What really matters is your personality and dedication when it comes to raid. They bench the player not their character. There's enough priest spot to invite even NE to raids, I don't see why would anyone need 5-6 dwarf priest constantly...
---
The dude doesn't pander to a hyper audience and has mellow informative streams instead, this displeases /u/BadAssPleb
---
Challenge accepted.
---
Dude, never get the buffs of your own stuff. That's like AH rule number four.
---
I don't recall anyone actively testing it, but also as far as I am aware, no one has come out and said if it feels any different.
---
Have you tested your eyes recently?
---
Well OP did specify.
---
Yup, that's somewhat of the point - people compare the current behavior of Classic to when we lived in 2005 where all technology was terrible and forget those facts.
---
I had to go to summer school in order to graduate because of WoW.
---
ok I have an alt to test now
---
You must be confused a lot.
---
I thought I was misreading his comment but yeah, all those things he listed as cons are the challenges I’m looking forward to lol
---
You are correct. My bad.
---
From what I know DM tribute farming was real. Not sure about Maraudon.
---
Hunter main.
---
I don't like his explanation either. Not sure if I can explain it better, but here we go.
---
Spell batching simply means that spells are not cast instantly. Instead of a spell firing when you click it, it enters a queue (or a batch, probably better because the order doesn't matter).
---
This queue/batch gets emptied every e.g. 0.2 seconds (don't know what the real time is) and all spells currently batched are cast at once.
---
This means that if you cast poly at 0.01 seconds and someone else casts poly at 0.19 seconds they're still in the same batch and get cast at the same time. But if one casts poly at 0.19 seconds and one at 0.21 seconds, the 0.19s poly finished already and interrupts the second one, because the interval of these batches is static. Like a constant ticking clock in the background that accepts spells between two ticks.
---
Total wow noob here.
---
Will there just be BG and world pvp ? No arenas? 
---
I want to play undead priest and my friend wants to play orc warrior. How hard will it be to level together ? Will it take me long to walk to the orc area ? Is there a more efficient way of getting to level together?
---
Even with all the hate that modern WoW gets, I have to say that it is a much more responsive game and plays much better than vanilla.  So much, that when they slowed it down and added the GCD back to most abilities people were FURIOUS.
---
I failed every school I attended. I did however got a master in wallhoping and being a dick in WSG.
---
Even if it is a bit tedious it is still miles better.
---
I realized so early how it's just a waste of 3 buttons, not to mention how much faster you can do things from any stance if you have a macro or just place the stance button same place as the ability in that stance.
---
And he'd be oom before they killed it. There were several chunks of that fight where Esfand took over healing temporarily to allow the healer to 5second chunks of thier mana.
---
Bringing one healer isn't enough, bringing two is two much. Support Class.
---
If you are referring to the six stages they are releasing content you are correct. I'm sorry if i worded myself wrongly. The short of it is that after Naxx i released there will not be more content added the the classic servers. The next step is TBC servers after that, and those would be different servers.
---

Bald statement recieves comments and downvotes. Am i disabled? No you are all grumpies.....
---
Two things I learned playing as a Paladin which should apply to a Warrior as well:
---
 - Always keep your weapon/armor up to date level-wise
---
 - Don't expect quests alone to carry you to the end, you have to grind a little to not fall behind/stay ahead in levels, fortunately that also gets you silver to do the above
---
 - Get a ranged weapon for pulling ASAP(guess that doesn't apply to Paladins, eh)
---
I don't wanna kill myself, I just get extremely bored and uninterested
---
Lots of Addons I try simply don't work. Dominos just does not show up. Details doesn't work, same for Lunar Unit Frames.
---
Join an Hardcore-Guild.
---
This will sound weird, but "Casuals" spend 2-3 hours in MC and then Raid BWL on another Night while Hardcore Guilds clear BWL+MC in 1 hour. 2 Hours preperation for that and you're "done" with raiding in 3 hours per Week.
---
Then you can play whenever your Schoolstuff allows time for it.
---
Got to go and find a sleep study that lasts untill end of august
---
What a surprise, a T_D poster wants to epic troll "pretending" to be a nazi.
---
I work as a software developer and I know what happens to legacy projects over time. They don't want to support "two MMORPG" as they said in an interview and it's very likely we will get something after Classic - like TBC and WoTLK so there are reasons to not keep Classic as a legacy project. They really are very sensitive about their devops costs and frozen Classic would likely create those costs later on.
---
SC1 is in legacy mode, got an update for a remaster and that's it - it has very minimal infrastructure from their side and it doesn't have to be compatible with SC2. WoW is to complex for this.
---
It's absolutely necessary to do kitty dps. Really is.
---
Not that it was any better than just staying resto in my opinion.
---
That's a bit of a rarity dude
---
I don't think anyone has looked at the image I posted, you included.  You gave almost the exact same explanation but used 2 Polys for the spells.  But paraphrasing, you said "the 0.19s poly finished already and interrupts the second one, because the interval of these batches is static" just does't make sense.  That isn't true, but I think you mean to say one might expect that to be true.
---
Why would someone spec that deep into arms for a 1h
---
No they don't "lmao"
---
This is a game within the game that can totally grab your attention
---
Cheers.
---
Hunters are probably the best wpvp'ers and duelers in the game. A good hunter should defeat every single class, and most if them with relative ease. High damage (aim shot crits can 1 hit casters if you're a little geared), high survivability, a bunch of good pvp utility and you can also kill people at a 40 yard range and just kite kite kite. It's a pretty fun class in classic!
---
Absolutely this, we had a core of 30-35, the rest would just show up and get spots. It’s better to run with 35 and a ret pala than just 35, the boss has the same health no matter what. If you happen to be in a guild that has say 50 people looking at 40 slots then those less favourable specs may be left out. Hopefully people can play what they like though. I have my doubts about pala and Druid tanks being able to hold aggro though
---
Back when rewards were static, and not catered to your class.
---
&gt; Has there ever been an MMORPG beta in the history of gaming where there wasn't a wipe before launch? 
---
All which started with "open beta"
---
What server was this on anyway?
---
Don't know yet.  Expect them to be announced around Aug 13 when we are able to pre-make characters before launch.
---
Exams 0%
---
Wow 80%
---
Fapping 20%
---
That’s how it will be for me
---
Will there not be a 60 beta test? Seems weird to beta test only "half" of the game.
---
I'm going to be leveling a priest this time because my friend played a PvP disc/holy priest back in the day and I would see him go into BGs, bubble up, then do some holy fire nukes and melt people. No body seemed to know how to counter him except some hunters and it was glorious.
---
This is on the PvE beta server.
---
Tbh, getting HoJ is a lot more hype then a quest reward
---
Spam frost bolt faster
---
is there anything more fun or rare to farm at end game solo? raiding/gearing or pvp or gold farm maximising doesnt interest me. Just chillin and killin stuff. I guess skinning would be good take for that purpose to have something extra to do, and are there good skinning farm spots? contested or doesnt matter?
---
or if theres isnt much to do i guess i might just try leveling another character and have chillin and killin that way?
---
I don't understand how your opening example relates to this. Since you put bug into quotation marks I assume you are trying to say that it is working correctly due to spell batching. 
---
If Esfand tabbed to the player before casting Hammer of Justice, why would his client ever send "Cast Hammer of Justice on Grounding Totem" to the server?
---
Honestly I keep going on retail out of desperation to play WoW; and I can't stand it.
---
I finally buckled and played on a private server this weekend, made a dwarf hunter and had a great time. Then I decided to make a dwarf hunter on retail and everything just felt bad. Mobs dying immediately, spamming hard hitting gun abilities at point blank range, no snow coming down, not worrying when I pull 3 or 4 mobs.
---
It really was just a brain dead "checklist" activity and it was awful. It's official, I'm one of those "retail sucks, classic is the only way" people now.
---
Odd question: which class/spec works with the LEAST amount of active skills, not counting self-buffs?
---
I'm still torn between the two. I started with TBC and never played a cloth caster until I rolled a lock in WoD, but I'm planning on a mage for Classic. I don't plan on going hardcore, my Master's Degree is way more important, so atm my conclusion is that it comes down to aesthetics, as the difference in racials probably won't be noticable at a semi-casual level. I'm leaning towards undead, unless the loss of Beserking is going to be a huge hindrance for raiding
---
Thanks for your insight, it's really helpful. This even makes me confident in going holy pal. Thanks you !
---
They sell for a whopping 19 copper - half of what one piece of \[Simple Wood\] costs. No wonder the guy didn't survive his campaign.
---
Fair point mate !
---
Yeah I'm not really on either side of Classic vs Retail.  I play both and Retail is inarguably better coded as far as gameplay, animations, NPCs, responsiveness, etc.  While those are all great, intentionally limiting some of those features greatly increases the immersion into Classic.
---
I'll stick to F1,F2 and F3 thank you very much (It's not like warrior ever needs to target party members anyway)
---
But this looks like it would be way useful for macro modifiers. Pressing Alt with your thumb only lets you to press 1-3 maybe 4 without moving your hand, and Ctrl and Shift pretty much require you to take your fingers off WSAD which also sucks.
---
I listed those as reasons why MOST people won't like Classic. I am fully aware some people do like those things, that is why I am playing Classic, those are things I enjoy, but my head is not so far up my ass where I think MOST other people will too. No idea how you read anything else from my post but that, but I'm going to assume it was a failure on your part.
---
People honestly don't compehend that the majority of WoW's playerbase are casuals who enjoy having stuff easy like it is now in BFA. Just like every expansion, WoW's subs drop a few months out and keep dropping until the next expack. The majority of people don't hate BFA any more than they hated WoD, Legion or Mists. Reddit and WoW forums are an extremely small minority and we do not represent the largest part of the playerbase AT ALL.
---
Classic was always easy and casual.
---
No arenas, but a priest and warrior combo will do super well in any PvP!
---
Not a problem leveling together, it'll be great actually as warriors often have downtime but with a priest it'll breeze. And you basically have dungeon groups whenever you want them!
---
Not hard to walk to the orc area, use the zeppelin from outside undercity to outside org then run down.
---
You could also just meet in the barrens at level 10+ and continue from there together.
---
Enjoy!
---
It shouldn't be in the game period.
---
And the new expansion will take a cut from classic and vice versea
---
Somebody woke up Deathwing accidentally and launched cataclysm
---
I'm glad you think elemental shamans are healers as well
---
I just didnt go to school for 4 months getting my rank 13, fuck it dood.
---
Yup, but that added to the immersion and made the game feel big and dangerous.
---
Being a mage is about a lot more than just dps. Doing good damage plays a big part of it, but you also have to decurse, polymorph, aoe, counterspell etc. Also you provide food / water for the raid. Don't be one of those mages that refuses to give water.
---
Won't matter a bit unless you want to be ultra stinky gooch seat dedicated
---
&gt;  in old wow leash distance reset any time a mob was hit, so you could avoid mob leashing anyway.
---
Yeah, isn't the real issue here that leashing is in _at all?_ They only added it for world bosses during vanilla.
---
That sounds pretty good tbh, as the guy said as long as there's no automation it's fine by me.
---
They must do it WAY before that. So people can prepare.
---
If you wanna do PvP on alliance you should go gnome or dwarf instead of human (if you care about maximization). The human racials are not really useful for PvP, but are best for PvE.

&lt;AfterDark&gt; &lt;NA-PVP&gt; &lt;Horde&gt;
---
Introduction:
---
Hey, I'm Collins, one of the co leaders of the newly found late night raiding guild &lt;AfterDark&gt;. I've been playing wow since 2005, I've had a blast and I've made several great friends along the way who will be helping me run this guild. Many of our members used to be serious when it came to end game PVE, some having server first boss kills, years of raid leading experience with hardcore guilds, and a good understanding of what classic wow actually is. Unfortunately we're not that young anymore so NO LIFING this game and grinding for hours for raid boss glory is long and gone. Many of us have careers, families, kids, and well a life...But this does not mean that we don't plan on being a top guild on our server! We just have to work a bit harder with our limited weekend time slots! Which leads me to my next bit of information, what we plan to do.
---
What to expect:
---
This guild will mainly focus on the end game content, but at startup we will be able to provide, well not much, we're all broke and level 1. But we can hopefully give you a place you can call home for the start and end of your classic journey. We're a good group of people and we plan on pushing for level cap together, with leveling, questing, and instance parties. Once level cap is reached we will quickly push into End Game Content, with a very serious mindset.
---
Raid Times:
---
We will mainly be a late night weekend guild. Since we all work second shift through the week.
---
Saturday -11:00PM EST- 3:00AM EST 
---
Sunday -11:00PM EST- 3:00AM EST
---
If Interested:
---
if you're interested in this guild, please DM me. CollinsLaneTV#9604
---
Classic literally started the casual MMORPG trend/themepark dude.
---
Imo the you should make her come to you, orc starting zone into mulgore and barrens &gt; ud area
---
Because UD had their armored epic mounts finished in time for release while all other races didn't. Unarmored epic mounts were never intended to be in the game. UD weren't excluded, they were the only ones who *weren't*.
---
I saw this so many times on WSG, the grenade's seems to have some sort of bug when you throw them from low ground to high ground or vice versa. When you are not on the same level with the target, grenades disappear. No explosion effect, no stun, no damage.  
---
I guess no one reported it yet, I reported this to some streamers but people are just ignoring some stuff like this, seems like they focus on playing and enjoying only. (hey, I am not jealous but we need to be ready until August).  
---
I have no idea if its related with layering on WSG or what but I am sure that there was nothing like this on Vanilla. I dont want to imagine that we are throwing grenades to another layers lol, it makes no sense. Maybe a terrain issue or something like that.
---
model=|=skin
---
Pretty much exactly the same as you. Most of my wow vanilla memories are attached to system of a down 😂
---
Personally rooting for this option too. Too many design problems to just reintroduce expansions as they were for the next decade, unless Blizzard wants to replicate the drop in sub count after Cata as well.
---
Honestly not too hard overall buddy, what either of you need to do is head out of the starting zone and (if your Undead at least) continue East until half-way on your map. You will arrive at Undercity, home of the Undead. 
---
Outside the city gates you will find a giant flying Zeppelin that travels back and forth between Orgrimmar - the Orcs home city and Undercity. 
---
When you jump off the Zeppelin you will be in Durotar, you then go south to the bottom of the zone map - and take a small left which will lead you into an area called “the Valley of Trials” which is the lvl 1-5 starting zone for Orcs.
---
Getting to the Zeppelin is the easy part, i’d recommend once getting to the orc area to create a lvl 1 Orc character and once loaded in press M for the map. This will let you know approximately were your friend is.
---
This will take 30-45 minutes so be ready for the walk.
---
If you wanna do PvP mostly, then you'll probably play daggers anyways. The competition in raids for daggers is really low because most PvE rogues and warriors will go for swords.
---
&gt; "TBC killed world pvp" is seriously over exaggerated.
---
Honestly, on my server it totally destroyed world interaction, PVP or otherwise. Within about 2 weeks of people getting their flying mounts the world became like a ghost town.
---
I'm aware, but the model is also different.
---
It depends: do you want to be a min-maxxer? Do you want to every advantage you can get, even if it's only small? 
---
Or do you just want to play a race because it's cool and you'll be looking at the character for next couple years? 
---
Just need to figure out what matters more to you :-)
---
You don’t need to be a tailor to wear bloodvine, just to get the set bonus. Ofc if you’re wanting to min max, having tailoring for the set bonus is worth it
---
Maybe for many who care about the current state of the game.  We'll just have to see how many are just like me.  Those who haven't subbed since Wrath and couldn't care less about current.
---
I'll not be buying expansions, and from the looks of things this is going to be my longest subscription to anything.
---
There are a number of rares in the world that you may want to find a party for. Also the world bosses are on a random spawn timer I think, so you will have to scout for them and sometimes an adventurous player bumps into one and gets a big surprise.
---
I thought it was Asmon and Crew! ;)
---
Yeah it’s rather basic, but certainly a lot of ppl who don’t do that. We’ve all been there. None of it makes the above paladin some sort of skill god tho
---
Full time LEO(Officer) full time school for cyber security too, I will be playing  6 hours a day easy
---
retail bad amirite, now where is my karma
---
It's just so awful to level.
---
Actually a lot of private servers are apparently over-tuned because the game felt easy stock. Players didn’t believe the easy nature of Classic was a true experience so over-tuning created the WoW we remembered - a challenge.
---
As long as it’s better tho we seem a lot more tolerant of it than I had hoped
---
**&lt;undecided&gt; \[Semi-HC\] \[PVP\] \[A\]**   🇪🇺
---
**Who are we and who are we looking for?**
---
\- We are an international group of currently 44 people, consisting of various backgrounds. We have both experienced and inexperienced members.
---
\- We are looking to create a mature gaming community where everyone is valued and people support each other.
---
\- We are open to hybrids and off-specs if people are willing to make them work.
---
\- Our goal is to clear all the content (again)
---
\- As a group we try to keep an open mind and are willing to work with all people that share our values.
---
**Guild Structure**
---
\- We have an experienced core of players with private servers and the original vanilla experience (PvE and PvP)
---
\- Certain positions, schedules, activities will be decided by consensus. Checks and Balances are to be placed on all officers.
---
\- Reasoning for all important decisions are to be made public internally and are open for debate.
---
**Raid information**
---
\- Monday and Tuesday: 19:00 - 23:00 (+-30min, GMT +1)
---
\- Loot council, loot is in line with performance and effort
---
\- While full optimization regarding buffs, potion etc. is not required (in early game), people who put in the effort and support others will be rewarded accordingly.
---
**About you**
---
\- No matter if you are an individual or represent a group, we are always glad to hear from you.
---
\- We accept casuals and inexperienced players (and socials), so all you really need is kindness and a good mood. We do not condone toxic behavior.
---
\- We realize that sometimes life takes an unexpected turn, so if you can't be present during raids for some reason, we understand.
---
\- You can be a hybrid without being treated as a second class citizen.
---
\- Hardcore/experienced players are also very welcome
---
For any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to message me here or on discord. (tom#8446)
---
I never played BFA, so Darnassus is completely gone on retail?
---
How do they handled NE starting zones? Phasing?
---
Basically leveling up yourself vs your character...
---
I bottom line passed uni. Spent too much time gaming and that was even before wow.
---
Looking back, I regret those gaming years completely. There was so much I could have done to my life.
---
My happiness was measured by virtual achievements, and reality became blurred memory.
---
Luckily I am in IT. I have since done tones of self study and certificates to make up for what I missed. The happiness in real life is so much greater.
---
My advise is unless you want to be a professional gamer, the less game the better. Set short term and long term goals in your life and reward yourself when achieved. The real game is much more fun than the fake game.
---
And they would have wiped without his clutch BOP and LOH. GTFO with this stupid attitude that dps is all that matters.
---
Blessing of Kings: Does it increase all stats including gear &amp; buffs or does it only increase stats from gear on classic ?
---
.. What?
---
Ok, first: wtf. Second: WTF   
---
Back to topic: I am basing my numbers on comments back in the day (which is what private servers do too). For example this: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11684/ironfoe#comments:id=3036008   
---
Could that be wrong? Sure, it could. Excessive testing wasnt a thing back then. Adding in the fact this was an extremely rare drop from the end boss of an insanely long dungeon and could be comparably easy replaced by more obtainable stuff... yeah, its hard to get accurate numbers. But at the end of the day these are the best sources we have and way better to take these with a grain of salt than to make up some random bullshit.
---
You absolutely could in vanilla WoW. I saw all of them with my own eyes.
---
Bring a mage. Problem solved
---
I suspect that a smaller portion of current wow players will actively avoid current wow when updates come out, but I also suspect that there are a lot more people excited for classic, and classic only, than many realize.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Each time they play PvP I have to make an effort to stop looking at the paladins. Esfand is probably the best of the bunch. Sure they have tactics, knowledge of enemy classes but whats utterly missing is any skill use above judging command, HoJ and selfheal. 
---
BoP is sorely underused and they don't seem to grasp the concept that judgement can do more then damage. I lost count of the number of druids and shamans running of because nobody bothered with JoJ.
---
I'd say after the dust settled it made Feral tanking viable (debatably optimal as the 3rd of 4th offtank) and moved feral-dps from laughable to "its okish if you farm gnome enough"
---
With Karazhan I specifically meant the crypts/dungeons. IIRC you could only get in by blinking through a barrier on a mage.
---
Oh god yes
---
Sanctuary*
---
DarnASSus♂️
---
In weird situations it might do OK.... 
---
But it absolutely is not a thing in the endgame of Classic WoW. 
---
It can do some stuff, it can maybe run some numbers in a YT video, but it really won't do great stuff across the board. They just don't do as much as [Mage, Warlock, SPriest] in terms of a ranged caster. 
---
Hell, I wish they did, I love the Shaman archetype, but their elemental kit in vanilla is just garbage. It's not as garbage as a boomkin meme build, but it teeters on the edge of it, because, again, it's really, really, bad. 
---
Still leveling a shaman as my alt and I'm still gonna rock a Ele/Enh build because even if I'm a hater I can still love the idea, I just don't expect to do well. I'm cool with that.
---
1% of them went into Naxx yeah, quite a lot more went into MC and especially ZG.
---
Yes Varrak did a great speed run on a non blizz-like server. I've heard that criticism since I started the guide 8 months ago. You've been quite a vocal critic of the guide. Have I spurned you in some way? What is your personal problem with me exactly? Have you actually tested it or just giving low effort criticism?
---
About 38/46 segments in the written guide use Varrak's videos as a source of information. The ones based on Varrak's videos are modified to make up gaps of which some still exist. I have worked on the guide for 8 months and will for 3 more before classic releases. I have personally tested the route multiple times on private servers and it is not shabby actually. For someone who is a student of the game and not an expert I'm actually very proud of my work over the last 8 months and have learned a lot which was one of my goals with the guide.
---
Varrak's name and link to his videos are featured 38 times on the homepage alone. They are also at the very top and very bottom of the 38 segments that use his videos as a source for the transcription. What more would you suggest I do to feature his name? Can you link the 8 month+ project you've worked on for the classic community while your at it? I'd love to see what you're capable of building instead of tearing down. Your words for someone else recently on reddit were "You are a fucking moron." My advise would be to build things instead of tear them down. Could leave you with a more positive world view.
---
Yes, no arenas (apart from the open world arena in STV), but that is a free for all mass fight.
---
Undead to Orc is super fast. Just do both your starting area to about level 5, then hop the zeppelin from UC to OG or the other way around and quest on together. 
---
What means efficient? Faster to 60?
---
Indeed, I remember still having CRT going into WotLK...
---
Why people care about these people? I don't understand.
---
Is the answer 4?
---
I got an exam on the 28th
---
Also if you do rogue on horse side and shaman is in your group only put instant on oh weapon for wind fury profs
---
This meme is as old as Vanilla lmao
---
I did that early on on Ely when there were likew 5345345 people in Northshire and you really could not level. Got me to Level5 somewhat quickly and then I could move on to Elywynn.
---
I haven't even said a word about that matter, just that you do not understand sarcasm.
---
One could assume that you lack understanding in other fields aswell, but I had no intention to do so.
---
I should reconsider my position though.
---
kill or be killed.
---
Prob was back in the day but not now with all the info, also with dm you Get better bracers and a good one handed sword with sp
---
🎵 **FACING, AWAITING⠀**
---
They already had to use Lay on Hands on Mograine alone earlier, though. I obviously don't have any data on numbers for Archaedas, but it wouldn't surprise me if he was hitting 20-40% harder.
---
Mate JoJ slowing people to 100% movement speed was a TBC thing - it’s not in classic.
---
Please stop this nonsense. World First is a title that should mean something, such as "World First Winterspring Frostsaber", "World First R14", or "Word First Atiesh". 
---
This is about as special as my little nephew's world first fart.
---
Good news! Thanks dude
---
NA horde. PVP. I am seeking a progression guild. Raiding 4+ night a week.  I will be doing a LOT of PvP in the meantime. 
---
 A prot warrior is my game. I started classic a bit late. Got my T2 right before our first xpac. Questions are welcome. Invites even more so.
---
I have a rediculous amount of experience. Both raiding and pvp.  Don't pass this tank up!
---
I can even resub and show off that warrior goodness I used to rock. I promise no disappointment!
---
Please don't use streamers wearing full 30 BiS with far too much free time as any sort of indication on the difficulty of content.
---
Moreover, the reason that everyone presumes they'll drop off has little to do with difficulty. It's the tedium and pacing that people expect to cause the drop off, as the modern crowd is used to much faster.
---
Yh it isn’t gone till max lvl
---
I do the leg under my leg too.
---
Streamers and having no clue what they are talking about. Name a more iconic duo.
---
No, sorry.  It was 4.5 bananas * 3 orders of fries + 3 sodas which = tree fiddy. Following PMSDAS
---
I think it's more that they care about the game. If we made this, our names would be up there and still been watched because of hype and susch stuff.
---
And why is Asmongold so successfull? because he is hilarious for some of the fans  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Agreed. It's gone above and beyond ridiculous.
---
hunters make it possible. with 3 hunters its like there are 8 ppl in the grp.
---
Except that’s not true because flying mounts only became available at max level, just like in every subsequent expansion.
---
Congrats they completed 13 year old content.
---
I was going to say, im 23 and played Vanilla but I thought I was a bit older. I must have been a wee lad.
---
I picked up ESO after cancelling my BfA subscription. It's an amazing game, the fight mechanics and story especially. Will be hard taking a break from it when Classic drops.
---
Sure but again he woulda provided all these tools as a holy pally which would have allowed them to stack another hunter for actual dps.
---
and knowing me all those items would be level 20 gear.
---
Most girls would be out the door quick if you mention World of Warcraft lol. Don’t pretend like regular WoW players are any better
---
Would be funny if the mages had to go out and respec in the middle of the raid just for visc.
---
Same, leveled a hunter as melee without talents because I thought it was annoying having my pet run away.. got to 45.
---
By helping all the newbs you mean begging all the guild friends to carry you through all the required dungeons and log in onto your alt at the required raid boss so you can take the item?
---
Thanks. That I'd got from reading and am very much looking forward to. Was more just wondering if there was ever random, say, 2 day only content with a reward that was then gone after?
---
Stealth is just so much fun lol. Being able to hang out in the opposite factions main cities was one of my favorite things to do on my tauren druid back then. One time I was stealthing around Ironforge and ran into an Orc rogue lol. We ended up running around together and became good friends.
---
Sounds painful
---
Lol. You re a dumbass.
---
That shimmering is the specular map on the ground textures.
---
you monster, Teldrassil is bae, you just never had a REAL life starting the game by the NE zone !
---
You can also get polymorphed in when standing next to the gate. Or get feared in. And Im not sure if that will be possible in classic.
---
Consider what NPCs you'd rather interact with. Consider what capital you'd rather return to. Do you prefer the big castle like outpost or are you comfortable around the spiky horde tents? 
---
Taurens are awesome but you don't really hang around their zones too much so I'd try to decide if you like Stormwind/Ironforge better than Orgrimmar.
---
Also what class are you going to play? I'm sure imagining the character model with gear will help you decide as well. :D
---
Can’t directly moneytize graphics. You can certainly sell games by having them, but you can’t micro transact them - you can with gameplay, so here we are: great graphics, plays like a mobile game
---
It's amazing that nobody was able to clear SM cathedral 14 years ago. Congrats on finally getting through it!
---
Rofl telling me to relax when all the flying fanatics in this thread are losing their god-damned minds about a feature that Blizzard said they regretted implementing.
---
i swear to god if this sub gets as shitty as the OSRS subreddit...
---
Hes very wholesome honestly. Def worth checking out. I suggest the azeroth arsenal series yo get a feel for em
---
The things they do for drama :(
---
Going to have an unpopular opinion and say I’ve been having a lot of fun playing retail, while I wait for classic. I started playing on 2006, and I’ve played through every expat, and I still love this game. I can’t wait for classic to get the chance I never had to play through it in earnest, but retail still has things that I find fun. 
---
I’ve been questing trying to get loremaster in EK and Kalimdor on low view, and while the zones are totally barren of other players, the story is good  and the quests are fun. Yes I can pull a ton and I one shot mobs in heirloom gear, but I can challenge myself by seeing how many I can pull. Pushing my abilities with the class I’m on and making it more interesting. 
---
I started doing some lvl 80ish bgs yesterday, and that was fun. Yes everyone has self heals and counters for everything, but it still came down with working with my team. We didn’t have healers so I supported our warriors and dks on my ret pally and it was fun. 
---
I get that retail is very different from vanilla, and I get that not everyone likes the kind of game it has become. I’m going to love vanilla, but I still have fun in retail. Sure you can like one better than another, but I’m finding more and more (excluding current bfa endgame) they are both good games with different features for different audiences. 
---
I am psyched that both audiences will have access to the types of games they enjoy more.
---
Female Undead have great casting animations.
---
They nailed the Paladin one at least. Describes a vanilla Paladin accurately and excites me to play one.
---
I feel like an old man but I'm really against these kinds of websites. I don't feel like add-ons should be promoted for a game we're trying to play old school style... Sure there were add-ons back then, but no DBM or w/e, and this'll change a lot of shit. People WILL find ways to rate you based on the amount of dungeons you've completed, and that SUCKS. The retail mentality is always gonna appear if things get easier... If you got a quest add-on you don't get lost, if you don't get lost you explore less and don't ask for someone for directions or help. I don't like that.
---
The above is the positives. The negatives are that warfronts are incredibly dull. You can W into them and then just sit there afk and you will win - at least I’ve never heard of a war front being lost. It’s basically an attempt to be old school RTS, you go around gather stuff, being back to base and upgrade your units. Eventually shit marches forward and you capture enemy bases. It’s slow, uninspired and tedious.
---
The question is different compared to what? Different pservers had implemented this in different ways. Also you will most likely not notice 1-2% hit when not actively doing the math.
---
Perfect thanks
---
I take it we will need to have a subscription to pre make our characters?
---
Oh that's true! I wasn't thinking about that!
---
I shall roll a hunter in defiance of everything said here. I shall lead a hunting pack of other hunters  and will prove all the nay sayers wrong. No but really we'll probably get our asses handed to us but it should be fun.
---
I agree with you, I guess in the long run, Classic WoW will be more of a "safe port" for people who loved WoW or even that still do but got upset with his current direction...the rest of its population will be a combination of 2 other type of players: a very small group that never played WoW Classic but tried and eventho its more archaic ended up liking it and pushed trough the leveling process and 2nd group that also never played classic or even Wotlk and TBC but ended up "following" their guild that has many veterans or 2 or 3 friends that played back in the day and end up staying for the community.
---
Having a smaller community that consists mainly of people that KNOW what they are getting into is actually a good thing for me, hopefully it will reduce drama and whining...
---
What truly worries me is 40 man raids, if the community is very small, maintaining a healthy raiding scene might be hard, with all the good/decent players tending to gravitate to "safer" guilds and not willing to join or even create guilds because finding dedicated players might be challenging.
---
This is just my overview, I can be completely wrong.
---
One thing is  for certain tho, Classic WoW, at least for a few months will raise sub numbers, simply because there are people currently no playing BFA, that not ever played it to start with that will come back to at least try WoW Classic.
---
In the long run I dont ever see Classic WoW existence benefiting retail population, will be good for subs in general but will never benefit the actual retail, it might even hurt their numbers.
---
Why? Because I can see the scenario of some veterans start playing WoW classic as their main game but I can very hardly admit a scenario of a guy who never showed interest for BFA (or even Legion, WoD, etc), getting bored with Classic WoW and say: "you know what, since I am here might as well try the recent version." It can happen but it will be rare, the guy on this scenario will most likely go back to wtv he was been doing this past months/years.
---
So WoW Classic, good for subs? Well yeah thats a no brainer, you basically  got 2 games now.
---
Good for WoW current and future expansion numbers? Hardly.
---
Leveling is way easier and faster in late TBC.
---
Most early dungeons were nerfed, boss levels reduced.
---
Elite quests turned into normal quests.
---
Early spellpower gear got a huge buff, tons of green/white items from dungeons got changed to blue. You can do a full deadmines run in vanilla and only get blue items from VC.
---
Tanks are way better, paladin gets consecrate and taunt no matter the spec, warrior can thunderclap in defensive stance, and even talent into improved tc to easily aoe tank.
---
Low level content is a joke in TBC.
---
Honestly the thing I loved the most about vanilla got butchered mid-TBC.
---
I'm interested in knowing if Hyjal will be accessible. Back when I joined in WotLk, I was heavy into exploring hidden areas and to get into Hyjal you needed a 2 seater mount to avoid the No Man's land debuff. Not sure if there's another way to get around that debuff teleporting you out of the zone.
---
And it'll be cool to see how hard it is to get to GM Island again. Apparently 8.2 is removing GM Island from the game for some reason as well.
---
so glad you are able to speak for all of them.
---
The formats too busted because it was never meant as quality content, it was meant as repeatable content: log in, do your dailies, get your charity epic plus or minus 5 or 10 item lvls, see you tomorrow and don’t forget: you’re here forever.
---
Every time a streamer is live the gods flip a coin
---
Feral can work - takes lots of effort but they can keep up on damage. Bears can work for tanking too but it takes lots of effort and time commitment.  
---
    
---
Balance is worthless - goes oom and becomes worthless in 30 seconds.  
---
Ret is worthless - in a casual guild where you put in extraordinary effort you can get by.  
---
Prot is worthless - due to running on mana issues and lack of gear it can't really be used in raids,  but is good in 5 mans  
---
Elemental is worthless - runs oom, doesn't do enough damage.  
---
Enhancement is worthless - caster penalty hurts your melee hits too much, also runs oom and doesnt do enough damage.  
---
Shadow can work - lots of downranking cos mana issues meaning mediocre dps, basically only use is buffing warlock dmg  
---
Arms is worthless - fury is just much better.  
---
Beastmastery and Survival are worthless unless you're the nightfall bot.
---
We had ADSL back in 2005 and I had ~60-70ms to EU servers. I didn't see any weirdness when I was playing the stress test.
---
People would kill for a blind experience but we are curced with knowlage.
---
Go in blind, its eazy enough to understand while playing and when you are stuck or hear/read something you dont understand than look it up. 
---
To much knowlage beforehand could overwelm you.
---
Enjoy the game.
---
I played vanilla while I was 9.  I'm also 24 and I have the fondest memories of playing with my younger brother and my best friend in WoW.  We would pretend to be older then we were to get into guilds.
---
My favorite memory is of my lvl 40 hunter recruiting a lvl 60 player from my guild to help me lvl up my skinning past the point my lvl was able to kill in unguro basin.  He was killing skull'd lvl enemies while I would just skin them after.  As useless as it was I can't think of another video game experience anywhere close to it.
---
Uhm... ever tried Naxx 40 with a non top-guild? You can't clear this without the right specs of all raidmembers. Despite the fact, that you have a different composition every boss, this is simply not true. Or you mean MC and BWL only.
---
How is classic's "treadmill" more rewarding than BFA's. in both you grind for loot , usually dependant on RNG
---
I am alliance ,hear me roar!       meow
---
I bet it’s Just nostalgia of the days before the internet knew how to lie
---
Currently they have the number of players they want, so do not expect anything.
---
You can get it back if you talk to a time dragon.
---
doesn't really change what I know, no need to be nice to people when all I do is give advice.
---
Much better explanation. I actually get what spell batching is now. Or at leas the basics of it. Thanks dude
---
"Aggressive players" 90% hiding in stealth, heh
---
Heh, would you look at that.
---
By now I plan on playing a warrior come launch anyway, back then it was hunter, so that's gonna be easy
---
I ressubbed after 2 months of being inactive just for a chance at beta. Still haven't logged into bfa
---
I wasn't sure if this was a bug or not, but I opened a chest and got like 5 item spots of only potions. In total I got 11 minors and 1 lesser potion from the single chest, never seen this before so I wasn't sure if it was a bug or not.
---
This sub is one of the saltiest I’ve seen so far, and the game isn’t out yet
---
I feel it will be mostly cyclical. When retail sucks more will gravitate to classic, when retail doesn’t (or hype hits) more will go back to retail.
---
Feral druids are good dps if you use max consumables and Manual Crowd Pummellers. They are middle dps if they don't. They can tank just fine but they are quite spongy at first, once they get some BWL and either AQ/Naxx or rank 13 gear they become really good. Their tps is much higher than a warrior.    
---
Balance is complete garbage. It's a spec you pick to give some crit to the warlocks and mages, which is fine of course if the raid can carry them. We have a balance druid in our Naxx raids. He's a mate and he innervates my priest while buffing the warlocks and mages. 
---
Ret paladins are not that great either. You have to min-max really hard to even stay in the middle damage range and it's easy to burn out on it. On private servers they are really good Nightfall wielders. Nightfall is an axe that has a proc that makes the target take 15% more damage from spells. Ret paladins can make it proc from both his attacks and seals/judges which means it's basically up 100%. Whether this will be case on Classic remains to be seen.    
---
Prot paladins are really good for AoE threat and they can tank bosses as well as long as mana allows. They can't taunt though so tank swaps are impossible, they are quite rare in vanilla though. They are really handy for tanking imps in MC, dragons in suppression room in BWL, the tunnel in AQ40 and spiders in Naxx. A warrior can also do it but it's significantly harder so for mid-tier guilds it might be worth investing in a prot paladin but the top guilds will just make their warriors use an idiot amount of consumables to do the same.
---
Shamans I know nothing about other than enhancement has an improved windfury totem.
---
&gt; play whatever you want
---
Ok but do other people want to play with them?
---
This subreddit and having an unhealthy amount of hatred for streamers.
---
While I agree with you, there's a meme on twitch with world first on stupid scenarios, don't take it srsly lol
---
Not random, there are some events you can take part in but they are all pre-planned. They weren't during actual vanilla though, but now we know everything so they can't really make it a surprise anymore.
---
Autorun!
---
Two weeks is not enough time?
---
I think shaman is quite commonly picked but in my experience not a lot of people commit to it. Like warriors and paladin you see them everywhere at lower levels due to the class fantasy being widely appealing, but the kind of people that roll it for that usually dont stick.
---
At 60 shamans are heavily sought after so you will not have a bad time picking it
---
Which patch is this video from?
---
People complaining about not beeing able to enter the server is like rich people complaining about not having champagne when poor people are dying from thirst. Some of us are not even in the beta, let alone a chance of waiting for the servers to come up :D
---
If you get destroyed by people in MC gear you need to learn how to play your class.
---
Wouldn‘t consider it a bad loot, but seems odd, i only know there is kind of a „pre“ selected loot table for a chest on each slot, correct me if i‘m wrong about that
---
It’s going to happen if allowed.
---
Personally I will just use a threat and damage meter and that’s it. Really kick that shit old school.
---
I spoke with a GM and they said they will let more and more people in, whats your source?
---
Those are the streamers Cricken,Strippin, Admiralbahroo and crew. They were doing the wow Amish challenge last night on stream. Funny bunch.
---
"current population needs"
---
If hes a nice guy doing his best, come prepared, always attend raids from MC till AQ40. Big chance they keep him for Naxx awell. If his rep within his guild is good enough than yes. Also when there are not to many 'meme' specs in the guild already.
---
But if he swaps guilds around AQ40 no other guild will appect him no.
---
But this is a new player, telling him to fear for his spec choise because of the latest raid 1.5+ year from now would scare him to play what he want.
---
“The only reason this worked is because it is possible”
---
kvothe pawning his lute to make it to the Maer
---
"hardest class in the game" btw
---
If you drive or want to drive a car I don't recommend using these. Read this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3q88s5/tifu\_by\_using\_a\_pedal\_as\_my\_push\_to\_talk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3q88s5/tifu_by_using_a_pedal_as_my_push_to_talk/)
---
That's what I thought as well, I've generally always gotten a mix but almost always like at least one piece of food or an equip. Never had the same item repeated this many times in a row, just didn't seem right.
---
I see you aren't all there
---
You need to go through with it and always buy the relists too. And then hope that new buyers make you more gold than relists drain. This depends on the ability of the former sellers to grind said material.
---
&gt;Priest - One Disc Priest for Divine Spirit is good.
---
Well, dont worry about divine spirit when most are PI spec anyways early on when you have more than enough healing. You are brute forcing the content and using consumables if you need more mana.
---
Obviously I mean it in the context of him doing dps, otherwise what would be the point? I'm just saying he's convinced him DPSing is super important due to power shifting and he raves on and on about it a lot of the time, but Hunters are simply stronger due to no glancing blows. No idea why they didn't bring more than one.
---
NA, PVP or RPPVP
---
Alliance
---
Holy Paladin. Played at the end of vanilla WoW until the end of WotLK. Roled dps and tank at that time, now going to put in my turn as a healer.
---
Looking for a guild with a more casual vibe, but that will still be actively trying to gear and raid at the higher levels. Interested in PVP as well.
---
Work in Emergency medicine so I have lots of days off a month, but my schedule moves around. I will always be there when I can.
---
In Sweden we had good ADSL back then, most people I know had under 80ms. I am not sure IF batching is "correct" now since I don't have beta access, but saying everyone had that ping is just wrong. :) (I don't know about NA) 
---
We frequently played counter-strike and ping on some dedicated servers was 5-10ms.
---
So just 11 minutes of you being useless? xD
---
The reason non meta classes are never invited (except a god tier feral druid, they get pretty decent come AQ and can offtank well but it's hard) is because with each new raid you have 1 more raid to clear per week to gear up the raid (40people want gear etc). Would you want to spend 3-4hours in BWL when with proper specs it is cleared in 1hour, 2 if slow? No.
---
It's also about guild morality, fast clears make it easy for everyone. Once ZG hits you split your raid in half and do molten more with 2 25ish man groups as well to maximize gear. You cannot do that with meme specs.
---
I think it's still possible, but we are talkin about Blizzard "Fun Detected" Entertainment so it might not be there at release.
---
So you can Just import it from your retail tukui? Im looking for a was to create my Interface B4 Classic Hits

**&lt;Addicted&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Hardcore PvP/Raiding Guild - English**
---
**Introduction**
---
Addicted is a serious but friendly guild which is looking for outstanding players in order to rush the content when the game comes out. We will both rush PvE and PvP content. The members come from different background but we all have in common the passion for what the game used to be. Most of our players played on retail (2004-2006) and then on and off private servers.
---
**Goals**
---
* Have the first 60s of the server among our members
---
* Be the first guild of the server to clear the PvE content
---
* Break PvE records for speedruns
---
* Manage the PvP ranking of our server when PvP comes out (in order to have the most R13/14)
---
**Member Expectations**
---
* Be 60s within 10 days
---
* Strong PvE and/or PvP knowledge
---
* Team member, friendly attitude and not being a pretentious asshole :)
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
At start everyday until content is cleared. Later reduce that to 1 to 2 days when content is on farm/speedrun. The days are not defined yet but will be discussed together with the members.
---

The only thing you could do, is open the same chest again and check for the loot, if it‘s the exact same pattern i‘d say it‘s a 100% bug, if it‘s other stuff you probably had the one in a million case 😅
---
Orc shaman...
---
- cool lore
---
- fun leveling ( imo )
---
- wanted as resto
---
- most fun 'meme' spec if you bring one cus WF totem
---
- strong pvp racial
---
the reason most of damage is auto attacks for numerous classes is that they didn't want better players to completely outclass noobs
---
True, I can pop by tomorrow and see if I can replicate it.
---
so do we need to decide for you ?  
---
In that case, pick Priest !  
---
thank me later
---
Aggressively waiting until you get to 15% hp
---
That's fair. Thanks for the answers :)
---
How do you win as hunter vs warlock or spriest?
---
It’s a joke/meme, get that stick out of your ass, holy shit
---
Druids crave change. You bet they want some of that
---
It's clearly no fun to invest a lot of time into it, but getting to come back into what actually feels like "this world" and not a pserv version of it or retail, feels fantastic. The stress test itself gave me this feeling of "I'm back". And I could notice some bugs here and there, which helps everyone as well as me so I think it's cool to at least get into the stress tests.
---
Well.. Yeah, because that was the case.
---
Its way faster to just rush lvl 10 then group in the barrens
---
there are vanilla private servers. just sayin
---
Playing on an rp pvp server I can't tell you how many times I bubble hearthed out of ganking and just went to a new zone.

#Pertento#
---
**Alliance | RP-PvP | EU**
---
*Semi-hardcore raiding with a social atmosphere*
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
*Note: We will play on a RP-PvP realm if it's made available to us, if not we will opt for a PvP realm.*
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**What we provide:**
---
- An active, well-organised, and strictly toxic-free Discord.
---
- Experienced leaders; with a history of hardcore raiding and PvP in vanilla.
---
- The possibility for Socials and PvPers to thrive in the guild too, through social raids and BG premades.
---
- RP events in between raids for those interested (meaning less raid logging!).
---
- Community-driven members, with initiatives such as Vanilla Friends made possible by us.
---
- IRL meetups.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Wed/Sun + Monday (for progression) 20:00 - 24:00 CET

\*\*&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;\*\* | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild
---
\*\* Introduction \*\*
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded. 
---
One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment
---
\*\*Expectations from members\*\*
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment. 
---
\*\* Raid information \*\*
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com](https://www.senilechieftains.com) for more information!
---
You mean concurrently right? The wording suggests otherwise xD
---
I had a warrior who played with peddles back in bc. ..to see this today makes me lol
---
The classic version doesn't have the same settings as the retail version, it hardly have any settings atm
---
Make your anti current wow insult more Petty and vicious to get 100+ karma on this subreddit
---
Every warrior's wet dream. slap a windfury totem on top of that.
---
I have never played after Mist of Pandaria, which was my last expansion. I had my shadowmourne on my DK since WOTLK, and actually lore was finished for me with Arthas but I kept going because of friends.  
---
Raided hardcore, played hardcore. Had more than 1k days played time in total most probably.  
---
When friends quit, I also quit the game. I was not enjoying the game anymore since everything was so different than Vanilla to MoP period, and I was alone. No point to play an MMO if you are alone actually, atleast for me.  
---
Yet, I believe that blaming retail is unnecessary since its still the best MMO over there. There are so many things went wrong in this game due to Blizzard's financial strategy, which I totally understand since its a company which wants to make profit as usual, but dont forget that its the same company who is offering us the Vanilla experience again.  
---
This company made a lot of money from their customers but created something amazing for gaming industry. Most of my IRL friends are still from WoW, I still keep in touch with my friends from Vanilla, who are still playing casually yet they do not have as much time as before.  
---
I appreciate all the things that Blizzard offered until now, and their games were only ones in this industry which worth paying for.  
---
I am also very hyped for WoW Classic but I am sure that there are a lot of people who enjoy the retail at the moment and there is no reason to make this a Vanilla - Retail battle.  
---
/cheers
---
This is not true.. i just tested it on LH and maybe i got unlucky with linen but I just got enough Linen by the time I finished Silverpine at 14 and I had to grind humanoids quite alot of procs.. maybe will be different on classic (im gona test in the stress test) but I highly doubt you will have enough linen by the time you hit lvl 10 unless your extremely lucky..
---
Also to keep in mind when you DE the items that you make it's RNG.. you need 2 lesser essences, one of the copper rod and one of the wand.. when I did it yesterday I only got 1 lesser so couldn't make the wand, very very unlucky but it can happen.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=181967

This lists every change for hunters. You can skip to the TBC section to see what was changed.
---
Basically auto shot is smarter in TBC. Pets are better in TBC. But I just skimmed through it.
---
Doing a complete uninstall of wow and then installing only wow classic beta my client is 4.26GB
---
I live in the US (incase clients are different due to languages)
---
Just look at the screenshots. He is human warr, so i highly doubt his reference was to TROLL berserking, also if you know the game you know the icons 🙃
---
Warrior/Mage for Alliance
---
Warlock and Rogue for Horde
---
Pretty sure they can - the instance cap for all non-level 60 dungeons in 1.12 is 10.
---
&gt;(although that might be how it works on live too so im not sure its a bug).
---
&gt;There’s a setting for it in the TukUI settings on Retail.
---
&gt; I'd really like to know what all the flags are and if there's an element of randomness.
---
my guess is that they have profiles of players like the achiever, the pvper, the explorer blablabla and to that you add account age, frequency of playing etc in order to get the highest variety.
---
my second guess would be a blind deaf guy thrown into a pool of marbles where each marble contains an account name. fish him up periodically and make him empty his pockets.
---
Hey! I'm a retail player but am seriously excited for classic WOW - For, If nothing else, the fact it's a reset and the greater sense of community! 
---
I dunno if it's information you have, or would readily give either, but as an Alliance player, what things would you farm when vanilla starts? What's gonna be a big way of making gold early on? Anything you need to rush?
---
travel form gives movement speed and i think kitty gives movement speed as well with talents
---
TLDR: There is no personal problem, you are being stubbon, try and fix and stop taking credit for varrak's work. 
---
"Your" guide simply does not work, so fix it or do a video play through proving that it does on a repacked server with the correct quest turn in values. 
---
Putting varraks name as a video description play through takes away the work he put into it. end of the day this Varrak's video guide in written form with further edits by Sage, not Sages Alliance guide.
---
Well I'm 3 years younger than you and I started playing wow in 2005.
---
MC in 30min including Trash and Walktimes? :o
---
They should be able to 10 man though - only the endgame dungeons have a cap of 5 in 1.12.
---
He said it was a bitch, not that it was difficult.
---
It's easy - it's just very slow and tedious, and even heavily lends to just pressing 1-2 spells then afk auto attacking bc of how mana regen works f.e.
---
OSRS has like 3 times the retail game population, just saying...
---
That's brilliant, thank you!
---
1. Classic wow and Modern wow are both under the same subscription. One does not interfear with the other. You can play both games.
---
2. Yes you keep your Modern wow characters since they are seperate games.
---
3. Its a seperate game with his own client. The only thing it shares with Modern wow is the subscription.
---
4. Once Classic comes out everyone is level 1 on fresh servers. There is zero overlapping from the 2 games. They are always seperate.
---
Decimation [Deci] EU - Alliance PVP. 
---
**Background**
---
Decimation was created in August 2005. We were one of the most hardcore alliance guilds in vanilla. We defeated Kel'thuzad Nax 40 as the 4th guild in EU, and 8th in the world, and at the same time created the first Atiesh mage version in the world. 
---
Times have changed. We are no longer school skipping teenagers, but the passion, experience and knowing exactly what it takes remains. 
---
Seeing as we are all older now, averaging around 30-31 we intend to spend our time effectivly and the goal is to be the most progressive guild on the server we pick. Seeing as we know all the fights, and what it took; I feel pretty comfortable to say that we will be able to raid only twice a week and still compete for server firsts.  Raid times are not yet set. 
---
**Are you looking to experience all the raid content in vanilla, while not losing your job?**
---
Add me on discord: Zunneh#8369 We are currently recruiting all classes. Which server we pick will be announced in the discord. We will take in socials until the roster is full aswell.
---
Damnit Chad...
---
The only ones I see noticing would be warriors, since so much of what they do is tied to the rage they gain from hitting their autos.
---
"Special". I see.
---
And to answer your second question: Yes.
---
I understand that you are a rude lackey with a clear agenda and a new/alternative account.
---
That explains a lot. Good bye.
---
Afraid I do not have that, but I Leveled both back in vanilla and definitely had an easier time with Rogue. I’m guessing if you know what your doing and get consistent gear upgrades, warrior will compare, but rogue is just so much more forgiving due to the tools
---
damn 2 separate voice chats that revs my engine
---
That was the dumbest thing I've watched in a long time.
---
Subscribed.
---
Well it's common knowledge that American internet is shit compared to elsewhere in the world.
---
Warlock, great in solo pvp as well as group pvp. Also provide huge utility to raids
---
An active subscription gives you access to wow classic. 
---
Classic and BFA are played on seperate servers.
---
At the classic launch, everybody starts over again at lvl 1.
---
Your BFA progress wouldn‘t get lost as it‘s an entirly diffrent server. 
---
You also can swap between what you wanna play back and forth.
---
This is retarded, sometimes people need to stand  still and realise what the hell they are doing
---
I’ve found a number of useful things at the barrens website. Defo worth checking out
---
The internal cooldown didn't come out until a hotfix in BC because dual wielding Windfury was doing too well. And that was after they had fixed a bug where WF on one weapon was causing the other weapon to proc (basically double WF on each weapon). It was undocumented too, so we only found out about it because of theorycrafting.
---
The thing they changed in Vanilla was WF proccing off of WF procs. So you couldn't get multiple procs from 1 swing. It was less about PvP and more about not pulling massive uncontrollable aggro in Raids. (Not that there were more than a handful of Enh Shamans raiding.) It did ruin the one-shot WF PvP vid scene, though.
---
Classic and BFA will be completely separate games.  Nothing you do in BFA will transfer to Classic and vice-versa.  
---
The only thing the two have in common is the subscription fee.  One subscription gets you access to both games; you can choose to play Classic or BFA or both.    
---
When Classic comes out, everyone will start at level 1 on Classic.  BFA won't change at all, so all your characters will still be there if you're interested in that.
---
Watched most of this live. I’ve been salty about streamers on Reddit for the past month or so but this was actually enjoyable. Especially as they were effectively half a party as Asmond and Esfand barely broke 10 DPS on the meters.
---
Priest, you can't have enough priests.
---
Hey! The Gnome rogue named "Spy" Is one of my favorite wow youtubers from back in the day (He still going strong theses days)  WowCrendor, I was randomly watching this stream. Im sure you can find footage on his Twitch.
---
who hurt you?
---
Warlock or Mage tbh
---
You underestimate Druid I think. It’s very slow till 20 but after that is both speedy and has no downtime
---
In which scenario? Raiding? 
---
In a raiding scenario I'd say mage, the only other abilities or items you use besides frostbolt are Evocation/Mana Gems/Pots. Your entire PvE rotation for a long time is going to consist of only using one spell, at least in single target encounters. 
---
Warlock also comes to mind, but they use Life Tap frequently. Other than that, mostly Shadow Bolt and, occasionally, Corruption or the Curse you are meant to apply. Though that's a one-time thing in most encounters.
---
we are just roleplaying the vanilla retail wow forums lads.
---
All three will have use throughout every tier in Classic.
---
Priests will always be needed, whether it be heals of if you are the lucky one that gets to go shadow to stack Shadow Weaving for the warlocks.
---
Locks start off somewhat weak and inconsistent, but as they get better gear, they really start to take off.
---
Hunters are the opposite of locks, start off strong, but quickly fall behind as the other DPS classes scale much harder.  Still, you will be needed for your enrage dispel with tranq shot, and your ability to kite.
---
If you still had to whisper manually im fine with it. Thats not automation, thats sorting the chat.
---
A simple out of combat rez is all, pls blizz
---
But he doesn't have wolfshead helm? It's gonna be some pretty bad powershifting without that.
---
Vanilla was never really that hard of a game. Computers sucked, the internet sucked, resources for learning the game sucked, and the game buffered out a lot of it's balance issues as it progresses to 1.12.
---
So coming back after a decade and a half to a game we've picked through meticulously playing a version where shit was as balanced as Vanilla ever was is of course going to make the game feel easier.
---
The fact I can walk through a city without my computer going nuclear, let alone an instance or raid, is a pretty big quality of life update. Same with easy access to macros. Quality of life add ons. Etc.
---
Yes - you can play both games and progress through both.  They’re essentially two completely separate games, and you get access to both with your monthly subscription.  The two games will be on completely different servers, and will not interact with each other in anyway. 
---
Also, just to clear something up, as it sounds like you may not be aware, but WoW Classic is a reboot of the vanilla version of the game (levels 1-60 and the content that existed from 2004 - 2006).
---
it should only take like 15 minutes to get to the other starting zone. And you can do it at lvl 1, I've done it before. someone might get killed outside of the undead starting zone though
---
Except it's not. Not to these guys. And not to the people out there who have actual world firsts in WoW.  
---
These guys have never had a real world first. Like they claim world first about everything. For example, when they claimed world first WSG win while another WSG actually ended before theirs, so like was there no winner in the other one?
---
You can joke about something and it's funny (even if midly) up to a point, but then it just becomes worthy of Captain Picard famous facepalm meme. People gotta learn when too much is too much.
---
At lvl 30 SW make more sense since you're closer to BB,...
---
At lvl 60 people will be hanging out in IF since it's closer to BRM and the south of the continent in general.
---
It says Legion PTR for the BfA PTR aswell, probably because it technically doesn’t have a valid subscription on it. 
---
The client in use is the 8.0.1 client, you can see for yourself on [wow.tools](https://wow.tools/builds/diff_new.php?from=3f61afa3a1f8955900f0c09c61a17bd4&amp;to=346a019e0f6b88458cac2eeee380a31c) by searching for something like „zandalar“ that would only be included in the 8.0.1 client originally and has since been removed from the classic client.
---
i originally planned on playing pala and this was going to be my build.  i think you're best to focus on +damage&amp;healing and being tanky - then when you have a moment to drop your reck hits you equip your 2h weapon, turn on seal of righteousness and blow someone away.
---
people who try to play palas like warriors have been doing it wrong all these years.  ret is 'ok' but its not what palas are about, it's not their strength.  they are steady terminators that equalise every fight (by removing debuffs and staying alive) and then slowly walk down their opponents.  +spell damage works with everything they do except white hits  
---
if you really wanna hit harder with those reck bombs you use shadow oil and get a weapon like halberd of smiting.  you can do 2k+ bursts of damage in between healing like a boss
---
in raids, you will have to heal and this spec is just fine for it.  you'll rarely get to hit anything, and if you do it wont be an amount of damage that matters.  full ret can be ok dps but its a lot of work to be competitive
---
I would love to see RothUI (diablo ui) for my tank. Really helps to keep track of rage and hp while tanking and just looks nice.
---
5-6 dwarf priests. Man lock up the alterboys
---
just let it go, it's over.
---
Probably threw himself off a cliff lol.
---
did you even do naxx  and i dont mean the easy mode Wotlk? he was a massive roadblock for many guilds when naxx was released. even the last boss of spider wing maexna was easier. My guild was the 4th in the world to kill Patchwerk as everyone else went for the easier bosses.
---
10/10.
---
Yeah, I'm surprised he went to Loch Modan and didn't just stay in Darkshore.
---
And this is why i want an rp-pvp realm on launch, example #99999991
---
It's a bit concerning they can clear the dungeon with this much of a level gap.
---
In CoT in tanaris it is still possible but the "regular" way has been blocked by a New small Patch of Land.
---
Teamspeak has whisper channels, Mumble has subchannels. Both are amazing for coordinating between subgroups of a large group. We use it a lot in EVE where scouts, dps, logi (healers) and fleet commanders each have their own subgroups, allowing easy communication inside the subgroups and within the whole fleet
---
Totally aggressive, hides in the shadows then pops out to stunlock crit, crit, crit, stunlock, crit, crit, stunlock, cold blood, eviscerate, dead. Never give the ops a chance!
---
no no no noooo +spell damage works on seal of righteousness so that combined with reckoning hits really damn hard even if your white hits are pathetic.  pvp pala should be all about dmg+healing, stam and int if he is going for this build
---
but yeah supporting is the main job
---
I love the look of resignation in his eyes. He looks like the guy who went in with the lowest expectations. And they were met.
---
I have the same issue, lvl 8 nightelf hunter
---
For alliance which i am going with my guild, it's gonna be pve focused. 
---
Therefor it's easy for the race class combination to be set. 
---
Warrior: Human
---
Rogue: Human
---
Reason for this weapon skills. 
---
Mage: Gnome
---
Warlock: Gnome
---
Reason for this 5% int
---
Druid: ?? Nightelf
---
Hunter: Nightelf
---
Reason for this, Nightelf has higher base agi and all the better ranged weapons are xbows/bows
---
Paladin: Dwarf
---
Priest: Dwarf 
---
Reason for this, dwarf priests are the strongest kind and as a paladin the 10 frost resist and stoneform is better than spirit, also not even worth having weapon skill as a paladin. 
---
But this suits me fine, 2 of each races. ^^
---
only twin emps ouro viscidus and cthun last longer than 1 min 30 seconds.
---
Its kinda hard getting any significant number of attacks in when the mobs die so fast at level 30.
---
 the audacity you have to use someones work, change it a bit and claim it as your guide via the title is unbelievable. not to mention that it will not even work as intended for the classic players.
---
You shouldn't see it as the same game.
---
See it like  this.. BFA=WoW 7, Classic=WoW 1
---
Different clients, different servers. Just a different game, really.
---
I am so happy that I get to ask this, but which “I was wrong about classic wow” video are you referring to? They are everywhere, Which is so heartening to see.
---
I know, and I argue that it stopped to be funny. Turning "World First" into a meme is a disservice to the incentive structure of the game.
---
You're free to be edgy, i love controversial humor.
---
what I don't love is stormfront OPENLY recruiting in chat.
---
I'm so going for HoJ again! Even if it drives me insane!
---
Vanilla is not that hard. We were just clueless back then to everything. Even the average lfr player has more of a clue than most old vanilla players did. That's something that we can't undo is all the years of knowledge and practice we've had at this.
---
Because in classic you acually work towards most things, you don’t queue up and play content you can’t lose just to get a slot machine pull. 
---
Even if you do it on a higher difficulty it’s the same raids and dungeons, there is no progression, just a really visible slot machine.
---
Oh! I had no idea. That’s hilarious. 
---
I’ll have to check them out.
---
Your comment just reminded me of the whispers you’d get from a level 1 character that someone had made on your server, just to abuse you for something you had done to them in the xrealm BG that just finished. Good times!
---
World first stick in your ass right here!  Err wait, no... looks like Katau2881 beat you to it by 37 minutes.
---
The numbers don’t lie.
---
That’s rad.
---
This is also true i'm afraid
---
Others already answered your questions so I'll just add a tip: with a sub you'll unlock your starter account and you will access to the game plus all expansions up to Legion (110 levels), so play a bit more before buying BFA (latest xpac, new zones up to 120).
---
If you find you like retail, once you're high level you can grind gold and pay your sub with it.
---
Probably because both Soda and Nick wanted to participate, and they don't play hunters.
---
I hope you realize that the backstab comp that Soda's team was running was conveniently able to ignore half the things that make hitting high level npcs hard.
---
Yea, it's a high capital sort of tactic, I didn't have the funds to keep up
---
Asmon had perfect pulling and LOSing, hunters amazing kiting and dps,  Esfand great strategizing (Blessing of Santuary) and support, Gachibass  NOBODY died.
---
Could of been someone looted it before you as well took the gear and gold left the pots behind although odd
---
A mount + training is 100g before discounts, what do you need the other 300g for?
---
The last guy that used this for microphone toggle nearly crashed its car when he tried to talk on his hands-free.
---
Geif. 👌🏽
---
For some reason I kept thinking they added it in BC, but it wasn't until WoTLK. They stuck to their no res guns for years.
---
You shouldn't assume things. I'm pretty far right myself.
---
thing is, I don't like nazis. if you do, that's cool, but I play games to enjoy myself, not to hear about why jews are subverting the west.
---
I'm getting the distinct feeling you made a mistake here.
---
&gt;:D
---
Is RFC really lvl 16? In my head it’s like 12-14
---
? Im confused by what you mean I personally prefer madseason over alex's channel, I dont watch many wow youtubers. I used to watch Hayven before he passed away.
---
Jews are awesome, they've made all of my favorite shows.
---
love Israel, love their condiments, motherfucking falafel, the works.
---
While your question is perfectly valid for warrior, the talent is shared with Rogues and can be found from the combat tree. Making swords the go-to for any non-orc, especially humans.
---
We hate them because we are obviously better testers and should have been invited to the beta instead of them, I mean, they're just playing the game, not even testing, wtf ? (/s)   
---
And we love them for the entertainment they provide.  
---
TL;DR If the thread is about beta access, hate. If the thread is about something cool that happened, love.
---
He also has an enrage timer.
---
What does "you are being stubbon, try and fix" mean? I've worked on the guide every single day for 8 months for thousands of hours and will continue to do so. How do you define "try and fix" if that doesn't fit into the definition? This is just nonsense.
---
""Your" guide simply does not work". You've made it pretty evident you haven't tested it so I'm not sure where your conviction for that claim comes from. You just commanded someone who has done 8 months of work and given you access to a free resource to do more work. No thanks on that. Please link the project you've built for the classic community. I am very interested to see what you can build.
---
How would you suggest I credit my own multiple thousands of hours of gameplay, game knowledge, video transcription, web development in 6 programming languages and visual design that I've put into the guide exactly? How would you suggest I credit the other speed runners whose speen running videos have been a source for the transcriptions?
---
Mate, everything you said resonated with me! 
---
One time back in TBC me and my friend were at stone talon mountains on our twinks, just dinged 19 (I was rogue and my friend was paladin). Next thing a human warlock level ?? Started killing the questgivers (40+ she had a mount).
---
My mate told me to make the move and together we absolutely destroyed a player 21+levels higher than us. We camped her body for the next hour, we will always remember that.
---
I genuinely don't want to be a dick and as a tall guy I'm just curious, but what do you do if you need something off like a shelf in a supermarket that you can't reach? I'm from a place where everyone is tall as fuck so I don't really know any 5"2 people.
---
God I'm so glad the average age of my up-and-coming Classic guild will be twice as high as the average viewer of these guys.
---
Of course this was on a private Server (N...) so the numbers may vary in Classic. But here we had a Time around 23 Mins:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4iOs38FKVY
---
What 200g? What do you need 100g for?
---
This, absolutely. Unless something does the exact same function, I'm going to have problems without it.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Depends, a new expansion will most likely follow BFAs model, which won’t attract a lot of classic players.
---
I like retail aswell, but at max level its just a chore. Gonna level my Kul Tiran in the summer in hopes of beta soon since leveling is more fun than island expeditions/emissaries
---
Wow, Had a much longer time in mind, thanks! :)
---
It's true btw. I was only half making a joke. pservers are riddled with nazis because there's no barrier to entry.
---
Pservers have such absurd droprates and absurd everything else that taking ANY of their data at face value is quite stupid.
---
I like mentioning the nazi thing because the community is as shit as the code.
---
We are The Remains, a semi-hardcore guild with experience in several MMORPG's. Looking to return to one of the first MMORPGs we played. TL:DR We are looking for progress, but that essential community feeling is just as important. Playing Horde on EU PVP server
---
What are the goals of The Remains?
---
Primary goal : Enjoy all content on a high level
---
We will accomplish that goal, by these sub-goals :
---
  -  Enjoying all aspects of the game
---
   - Become a friendly environment for our WoW members
---
   - Focus groups on different aspects of the game
---
   - Being part of a focus group, doesn't exclude you from other guild content or switching groups
---
    - Have a good reputation on the server because of who we are and what we stand for
---
What can we offer you?
---
  - A nice and friendly environment to call your home
---
  - A teamspeak server to communicate with eachother
---
  - A discord server for discussing WoW or anything else you'd like
---
  - Site and forum to stay in contact outside of the game
---
  - Raiding times will be Tuesday and Thursday from 19:30 till 22:30 (CE(S)T) and possibly Sunday from 20:00 till 23:00. Other evenings we will organise things as well, which will be discussed at a later date
---
 - EPGP guild loot system
---
What do we want from you?
---
    - Friendly and mature behaviour towards the guild and others
---
    - For hardcore players your commitment
---
    - For casual players your warmth and kindness
---
What are the pillars of The Remains?
---
    - Being a close community
---
    - Work together to accomplish common goals
---
    - No mass recruiting, we recruit people with the same goals and attitude, not to become a zerg guild
---
    - Respect, to eachother, to others and from others to us
---
Contact me on discord if you're interested.
---
Boci
---
&gt; Oh sure, **later on**, Daggers spec is amazing 
---
So you mean like after a week right? Coz we all know while very very few guilds will clear MC before the first reset, quite many will do so on the 2nd weekend...
---
And by then, there'll already be some teeths and perdis out there.
---
There is not going to be some "early progression" as far as MC/BwL is concerned. AQ40 War Effort, while arguably the most memorable and well thought world event in WoW, will probably not last a week on servers with the most organized guilds, as we all know exactly what'll need to be gathered so it'll be done before the patch even hits, the scepter quest being the real race (unless ofc the top guilds broker deals about it like happened in vanilla, ie rank #1 guild on the server will get to bang the gong, but not before other guilds can have their scepters ready, so there's multiple people running around with the Scarab Lord title.
---
Yeah it's honestly crazy. For example in the Dwarf starting zone, shared quest items spawn every 5 minutes and you have literally 10 of people fighting to click on it at one given moment. Classic has them on a ~20s respawn timer ALREADY CONFIRMED to be what it used to be in vanilla. But people will scream and shout that their game has changed because of what it was on the private servers.
---
This is what you might think but the truth is they start from scratch with each expansion. Retail is not that far ahead.
---
I can feel the autism from here
---
Phase 6 xrealm bgs please. As it should be.
---
Yeah, with Stealth/Distract/Sap/Vanish/Kick(not requiring to swap weapons)/Blind/sprint you can be relatively safe from combat. Warrior from what I've seen is fight to the death of you or the enemy.
---
Pog
---
he said not to spend more than 25% of your liquid gold
---
What is their set up?
---
I see the tank is a Warrior, Paladin Ret, Priest Healer and there is an hunter there because I saw a tiger. What is the last spot?
---
This is really bad writing. “People who hate losing” and “people who love to win” etc. These mean almost the same thing and they mean almost nothing at all. 
---
But I guess you can’t expect much better from a game manual. I own this one and thought the same thing when I read it.
---
Had to drop out of the highest school level that gives the degree for attending university to join the medium one instead. Things went downhill fast after April 2005 :P
---
To be honest I’m playing a scuffed classic without any hairloons and it is kinda fun grant it I never played vanilla but still
---
People have gotten to Hyjal in the beta.
---
Gatekeeping what constitutes a world first hahah
---
Thanks for the help! So if i just buy the subscription will i get all the game content until Legion and will be able to play classic? Also, another quick question. I'm just guessing here but BFA will remain the "retail" version of the game until a new expansion comes out and then BFA will become free and then only the new expansion is the one eventually I will need to buy? Right ? So then BFA will be the equivalent of what Legion is today ?
---
&gt; People honestly don't compehend that the majority of WoW's playerbase are casuals who enjoy having stuff easy like it is now in BFA.  
---
This is what we call survivors bias. The people who currently like BFA are indeed the people who are comfortable with the changes Blizzard has made over the years to get to the state of the game we are now, that is to be expected. You fail to take into account the people who left over the years because of those changes though.
---
Those, are the people who are the main demographic for classic, the more traditional mmo player. The concept of 'Wow refugee' has been all over other mmo's for a while now, especially since BFA release, ESO and FFXIV is filled with them, those are not going to return to bfa. They will however, all try classic.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Horde only, though there aren't a lot of things farming wise that is locked behind factions. It might be hard to farm Stockades/RFC by the opposite faction, but that's not something that really has a lot of profitable stuff in it afaik, and is easily accessible to anyone anyway. 
---
As far as the best ways to make money, it's generally going to involve one of three things. Crafting materials, crafted items and BoE drops. You can run something like Mining/Herbalism/Fishing and sell the Ores/Plants/Fish which will always be in demand and always be profitable. You can run something like Alchemy/Herbalism to gather your own plants and then make flasks and potions that sell for even more profit if you want to farm multiple materials, go to certain places to craft the potions and then sell them. And then there are certain items that drop off rare elites or from dungeons that can be farmed and sold for nice profit, but the spawn rate, claiming rate and even drop rate are huge variable factors making this not particularly stable income. If you plan to do this, you would be better farming ~1% drop chance recipes and then selling what the recipe makes since most people won't have it. The recipe itself may sell for a fuck ton, but the long term profit of being one of the few who can even make said item might be better, depending on the item.
---
There are tons of options, but it kind of depends how the market falls. A lot of people will be looking for a lot of profitable things. While something like smithing rods for enchanting, raid flasks, food buffs etc. are almost guaranteed to be an ideal pick for a lot of people, something like an important mage robe that is BiS from tailoring until raid may be something that most people overlook on your server if you are lucky. A lot of Mages/Locks may do tailoring and make it for themselves, they may not want to farm extra matts or think about selling them to other Mages/Locks who went with Alchemy or something else. This would be a good opportunity for you to fill that hole if you see none are on the AH, and you could make a lot of money until someone else catches on, which may be a day or a month. That being said, people will probably do this trick and when you see a few of them on the AH, you know to avoid bothering and just look for something else. 
---
I can't really tell you what to look for specifically because it will probably be in use by the time you can make it, all I can tell you is how to look for stuff and what kind of stuff to look at. As far as the mage robe goes, you can look up mage guides to find out that a lot of mages need it, and then check the AH like I mentioned above. As for food, flasks etc. you just have to dig through the AH and find what is in demand but not in supply. Most big guilds take care of their own and don't bother buying materials or items outright when they can have guildies farm it and make it for free, but a lot of casual raiders are always looking for consumables if you just want a constant decent profit. The big money is in filling a void in the market though, it's just hard to find it and keep it.
---
I like you
---
Which guide is this from? Weren't warlocks considered really weak early on?
---
Dwarves are natural sprinters, very dangerous over short distances!
---
Not everyone takes these things seriously, it’s just a game after all. Let them have there fun, it’s not going to affect everyone else’s
---
TBH they've reached out to their favorite's, We just have to be relevant or wait :)
---
I used nature enemy cast bar. Nature was a druid who made that addon. It was a small project and never updated but kept working through all patches.
---
You are the moron.
---
I'm not failing to take into account the amount of people who left because they hate retail and are returning because of Classic. I am aware of these people. Hell, I am one of them. The difference is I think they are going to sit at around 1-1.5 million a few months after launch, you disagree. Until the game launches and we wait a few more months to see, there is no point in arguing.
---
On horde, Threat management would be impossible... on alliance why not.
---
I plan to roll a warrior (cliche i know) and ive heard that when you have your gun equipped it adds the stats to your character, are these perm stats that help while using swords? If so should i aim for the best gun possible?
---
I like it. Sometimes I feel like fights end too quickly with other classes
---
we are at war.
---
Crimson (Horde-PvE) is recruiting.
---
Intro: We are a group who have been playing and raiding together for several years now, and are looking to step into Classic and progress at a quick pace. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding but go hardcore preparing for and during raids to make quick progress.
---
Goals: To be the best guild on our realm, and one of the best in classic, while we maintain a good quality community of friends.
---
What we are looking for: Solid players who want to push the limits of Classic and their class, while also being reliable and able to make our raid schedule.
---
Looting: For our 40man raids, Loot council is current plan, though DKP is still on the table. In 20mans, when available, we will generally roll for items except a few exceptional items.
---
Schedule: Our tentative raid times are Monday: 19:00-23:00 CET Wednesday: 19:00-23:00 CET Thursday: 19:00-23:00 CET Sunday: 19:00-23:00 CET
---
We shall use extra raid days to do guild dungeons, 20man raids, and farming when 40man raids are cleared for the week.
---
We require 90% Raid attendance.
---
If you are interested. Message me via reddit, my discord Oulous#4513 or fill out our Google doc.

Well you're a fucking simpleton aren't you.

Let me make it real simple for you.

guy 2:     "that guy said the ball is big!"  
---
you:        "no he didn't, he said the ball is large. You are a liar!!"

nit picking
---
Do we know yet if decursive will be working? If not does that mean clicking on each portrait in the raid frame or how is this commonly done?
---
I don't like (neo)nazis myself, I hate all kinds of extremism. I just find it amusing that you outright turned discussion about proc of a weapon into discussion about nazis. I know that you were trying to make a joke but it's just odd...
---
I found it in my battlechest (vanilla+tbc) box. It’s from BradyGameGuides 2007 edition based on the original guide and it is the book/guide on vanilla. i also have a separate one for TBC
---
Good luck man!!
---
There is probably something under the ToS about intentional prolonged griefing
---
If you already listed 7, why did you need to list even more? Why do you need to vendor your own gear just to list an 8th/9th/10th bronze tube? What would you have done if there was 1 guy who decided to undercut you? Cancel all 50 of your tubes and swallow the loss?
---
Just list 1-3 at a time and put up more if you need to.
---
There's no denying that Escape Artist is godlike in PvP, and that Stone Form is also very useful especially vs other rogues and warriors. 
---
But do not underestimate Perception.   
---
It'll give you the upper hand and initiation vs any other rogue and feral drood.
---
There were absolutely boss mods back then. Bigwigs was from Vanilla, I believe. DBM might have been around too. Not sure.
---
And there were quest mods as well. It was very controversial at the time because they mad you pay for it. I think it was called quest helper. It put icons on your map for quest givers and objectives.
---
Vanilla wasn't the dark ages. If there was something you needed, chances are there was an addon for it. They might not have been as sophisticated as they are today, but they definitely did the job.
---
Oh awesome, now I hope they don't patch it out during the beta. Know if anyone has gotten to GM Island yet?
---
Rogue mage or warrior
---
Don't forget it's not a spell dmg but +arcane dmg
---
Quest addons are not that bad. I had to alt tab every other quest to look up thottbot. And mods like healbot and decursive are not possible now.
---
I suppose we could try it if we could get a team of 5 attacking another team where they have healers spam healing a tank Druid or warrior
---
Dominos does the same
---
yeah cause elemental shamans are healers. you are so right
---
All I am saying is that WoW Classic is going to have about 1-1.5 million players on average after it levels out. That is a HUGE population for an MMORPG, especially one from 2004. My only point is that WoW Classic is not going to ever surpass retail in any capacity and most people in this sub are so blinded by hype and nostalgia that they refuse to realize that.
---
In general I'm right there with them, I love old school mmos as much as they do. Hell, I played FFXI for 7 years, it was more hardcore and grindy than even Vanilla WoW. I played Vanilla and TBC casually and went hardcore in Wrath. I am just as excited to see WoW Classic as they are, I'm just not going to pretend like WoW Retail is doing bad, like it will have less subs than Classic or like it's dead. It's none of those things. You can absolutely argue it's not fun to you, and I would agree, but most people would not, and that is all I am saying.
---
Once you’ve got enough gear that mana tide isn’t good, 30 ele 20 resto shaman is good. 
---
SM ruin warlock.
---
In premades AR rogue can do really well particularly Alliance side.
---
Hunter pve Mm if you take scatter (not all hunters have scatter in mm raid spec).
---
Disc / holy priest. 
---
Deep frost mate (winters chill).
---
Seal fate daggers beyond AQ.
---
Fury warrior in premade with AQ beyond, but MS would be better and GL getting into a premade without MS.
---
Standard holy paladin does well.
---
Watch your tone with me boy. You may be the waiter, but I'm still your superior as a chef.
---
How do you know the drop rate? Exactly
---
&gt; So if i just buy the subscription will i get all the game content until Legion and will be able to play classic?
---
Yep, correct!
---
&gt; BFA will become free and then only the new expansion is the one eventually I will need to buy?
---
Most likely, yes.  They just changed to this subscription model when BFA was released, but it seems likely to me that they'll keep it this way for the future.
---
There's a "fix" or work around you can use until the bug is fixed.  Unequip the quiver or ammo pouch you have, put your ammo in your bags and relog.  You can't use the quiver or ammo pouch but you should be able to auto shoot again.
---
Don't forget that the enchanting vendor (next to the trainer in cities) sells a limited stock of strange dust and lesser magic essence! The cost will be more than grinding out mats, obviously.
---
Warriors already have the upper hand against Rogues, dunno about feral druid though.
---
I ended up doing it at 18 on the beta and the quests were still yellow to me, but it can still be done as early as 13-14.
---
90s all the way.

The more i see these streams of Classic the more i believe Classic gonna be huge on twitch and in gaming community. Nowadays media and gaming tools like Youtube and Twitch and Reddit create a great opportunity for the Classic gameplay. I predict tons of funny moments from Classic streams every day, and many people would enjoy watching them.
---
Where can I purchase these ?
---
Perhaps, but I was listening to Soda decide what comp to run and he was adamant about kitty DPS being super good. He could just have healed, brought 2 Hunters and Sony as tank.
---
Of course they will. And front shredding doesn't work. Try using the search function.
---
Then we know who to laugh at beacuse they can only remember a private server that is even more off from vanilla than the second vanilla from the first vanilla the third vanilla is not good. Got it?
---
His group comp wasn't scuffed. The players in the group were scuffed.
---
Yes all characters will be gone.
---
Common sense says yes. Why would they give beta testers a huge advantage over everyone else?
---
I think the once per tick thing is a private server bug?  I’m not sure arcane missiles will work like that in actual classic, also blizzard is a channeled spell and it doesn’t proc per tick
---
Looking to play EST 5p - 9p and weekends. Want someone to level with! Microphone:Discord etc. message me!
---
please try to be civil while agendaposting to get changes implemented in classic.
---
it doesn't work if you flip your shit. having to create a new account to continue agendaposting isn't ideal.
---
Most definitely yes
---
This guy knows what’s up
---
Yeah, I just got added to the friends and family from a pal who works at Blizzard. Apparently they are still adding names to that list and invites are slowly rolling out.
---
not a discussion. I made a joke.
---
find it odd all you want. it wasn't me that disputed it.
---
it was, along with the shit code, the thing that stood out most from pservers. nost included.
---
Alliance:
---
* PvE: Human because of Sword Specialization
---
* PvP: Gnome for escape artist or dwarf for stone form
---
Horde:
---
* PvE and PvP: Orc for stun resist and Blood Fury
---
* Undead is also okay for PvP, but definitely not as strong as Orc.
---
There are 2 hunters, one doesn't have a pet out it seems like. 
---
Fairly confident it's a hunter at least since it's a night elf mana user with a gun.
---
see also: group composition that you will never see in normal play
---
So all in all, we can use bfa Addons to vanilla 2k19 ?
---
Theyre as much healers as shadow priests. Not their main role, but they can do it just fine.

Yeah, spell batching has sort of become a boogeyman since it's not very well understood. Any time a streamer comes in contact with a possible bug, they make a conclusion of "must be spell batching."
---
I'm not an expert on spell batching. I think most people in actual vanilla didn't even realize it was a thing, like you mentioned. Understanding and exploiting spell batching mostly became meta on private servers, and still only for the most hardcore PvPers.
---
I heard towards the beginning of beta that the spell batching window was wider than it's supposed to be. Something like 500ms vs. 400ms. 
---
There also has been some spell batching weirdness that people aren't sure is classic-like or not. For example, when Esfand returned a flag in WSG at the same time that someone else picked it up (both messages appeared in chat).
---
Me and my mates played classic at 11/12. Were going back in as adults with jobs, houses and kids.. I can’t describe the feeling of child like excitement I have for this game.. can’t wait lads
---
Looks nice, but I think you should really be careful with the amount of requests, data transfers and to compress images. On first load your website instantly eats up about 40mb. Lazy loading and compression (you don't need such high res for thumbnails) would go a long way to improve usability on mobile and on data plans.
---
A lot of bad information being thrown around regarding both Vanilla and pservers.
---
In Vanilla, at least by the time I started playing mid-2005, Ret/Enh/Ele were already considered worthless, Feral Druids were considered a nice boon if you had a decent and dedicated one and Oomkin on the outside fringe of, maybe the Aura makes them OK and I was in a guild that rolled Arms Warriors well into 1.11 when they were pretty well non-viable since like 1.9. Both the Oomkin and Feral opinion continued to worsen, especially as it became more clear as the Druid patch didnt make them that much better, Oomkin became worthless and Feral, a fringe spec.
---
Fast forward to 2011 pserver meta, people were farrrrr more open to bad specs, with the exception of the few guilds that came from a vanilla background. Most people back then came from WotLK or Cata, known as Wrath babies and Cata noobs back then, because they didnt know how the game worked at all. But these people came with their preconceived retail notions and Ret/Enh/Eles were all over the place. This slowly started to change over the years and began reverting to the norm, right to somewhere in 2014ish where it regressed back to what it was in Vanilla. By the time Nost launched, the meta was fairly well established, combined with Nost attracting a lot of older players, seems to have cemented an idea for newer pserver players that the meta is "just a pserver thing".
---
Thats it for the history lesson, as for raid spots, Ret/Enh/Ele/Bal arent going to happen. You might manage to find a guild as a dedicated Feral Druid, but its a hard spot to get.
---
 \&gt;If you go priest, and want to do any PvP, I strongly recommend undead. Very much my personal opinion and there is nothing wrong with troll, but the PvE benefits of troll are pretty marginal, and touch of undeath/devouring plague/WotFS will straight win every single gank while leveling vs. someone around your level range. The single target damage and tankiness is something most people just aren't prepared for. 
---
I'm not disagreeing with you that undead is really strong in PvP, but trolls are so often so overlooked and underrated. You have a weaker but still good healing debuff that's spammable (and can use rank 1 for it to be basically free) and imo Shadowguard beats out Devouring Plague overall thanks to having no cd so you can keep it up at all times to proc Blackout.
---
It's a bug in the beta
---
Profession suggestion: Weapon maintenance.
---
&gt;I have no idea if its related with layering on WSG 
---
There is no and will never be any layering or phasing in battlegrounds.
---
Yeah as i told its not about layering or something, mostly a terrain issue.
---
That's cool, i'll see if i can disable it in the next stress test xD thanks
---
Planning on doing with a team of mates. What levels should we be to have a shot? Don’t need to be easy, but doable
---
Warrior "Most popular class"
---
You what mate
---
Passive aggressive
---
I knew I remember seeing this in a guide! I got the battle chest too
---
Only me read Kazakhstan for a second ?
---
I prefer classic Darkshore to Retail one. Its less clean, more dangerous, mysterious and ancient.
---
LeT Me IN!
---
The dungeons in Classic are pretty damn easy, I dont think anyone can argue that, just bring the right comp and its all good
---
Haven't seen that one yet personally. I would assume it's possible since everything else has been so far. The only other thing I haven't seen so far is Old Ironforge.
---
Sudden damage. Many stuns. Wow.
---
So the gist I’m getting from these comments are, as long as your not worried about min maxing and your playing the game with a guild full of members not looking to min max and just have fun you can play whatever the he’ll you want and your guild will probably be able to clear all content, it’ll just not be as efficient. So play what you like as long as everyone is having fun. Lots of people on wow group up with the ones that line up with your viewpoints.
---
i would not recommend playing in release. Its gonna be super unplayable at least wait couple of days :D
---
Don't forget that classic doesn't evolve and that takes a great deal from a MMO. That the story doesn't go on and it always stays the same.
---
Just get a desktop PC; you won't need keybinds.
---
They could take away immersion / RPG elements, like transmog does for example. Having said that i'm all for graphical updates of zones and character models, as long as everything has the same feel
---
Almost definitely. That, or the characters will remain for future betas, but not the actual classic game.
---
Bullshit.
---
It's not bad once you get mortal strike. 1-40 is a lot worse than 40-60
---
It really doesn't. If I win it's not a big deal, but if I lose I absolutely hate it.
---
Did they plan their Mt. Erebor journey?
---
you could also just let people enjoy stuff :|
---
It’s what killed Anthem even though the flying was cool Shoulda kept it grounded.
---
So this was in wrath or later since you got the achivment.
---
True. All stats fro, equipped items count. So gun is in even when you melee. Of couse you may aim for the best as always. Or the most stylish.
---
They also specced specifically for the dungeon, which won't happen, i mean whose warrior is going to spec full prot and holy priest
---
Yep, I did the same thing back when a big Pserver launched. Except alongside selling them on the AH, I also went to darkshire and spammed that I was selling them and willing to either trade or CoD. I made *so* much god damn money, it was amazing.
---
&gt;Party: 10%
---
Fucking normie REEEEEEEEEE
---
There are sports of course for all kinds of farming including skinning. You may get extra stuff to do from professions. Alts / Twinks are fun, too. 9 Classes to play...
---
Now put those all on a rogue, with the Mace stun talents and the sword additional strike talents, and you have yourself a good time.
---
Fargodeep Mine was absolutely covered in bodies. Maybe this is why.
---
Will still have to farm BFA gold to buy sub time to support my classic addiction, IT'S A WHOLE FUCKING SYSTEM
---
I had two flurry axes and a HoJ for my fury warrior. So much fun in PvE
---
I have this guide. Damn I'm old.
---
Is Scrap working? To sell grays and trash? :)
---
NGL fully considering this now for my druid....
---
He doesn't on pservers.. where do you have this from?
---
nah its pretty easy with a solid guild
---
That's completely wrong. Please don't spread misinformation.
---
A lot of good rogues will want daggers for PvE, as they're just as good as swords. Getting the shanker is ez af for any rogue, then you just need to get a bit lucky at the end of MC (which is probably gonna get cleared under an hour during week 2)
---
As for PvP, I'd rather go with the good ol' 15/5/31 hemo spec than daggers, because while everybody expects rogues to eat clothies for breakfast, nobody expects them to cut through wars and palas like butter...
---
Pretty sure they were gone in 1.12 and this are almost certainly gone in classic
---
And there were websites too, I'm sure, but it wasn't as mainstream as it is, so it could have a much bigger impact today, that's what I mean :/ idk, again it might be irrealistic to wish for the actual original experience I had, playing without any add-on for the longest time. From when I started around BC to like MoP I used no add-on whatsoever, so... But anyway I won't, so it's whatever, people do their thing !
---
I would like them to try ZulFarrak :P
---
I am 22 and played since wrath, too. But wotlk just was my "classic". Back then I still even found people to level with and found friends naturally. But this became less and less. I just don't know, if it will surprise me THAT much, even if I very much look forward to play a WoW with everything I loved about it. Retail ist just a joke anymore.
---
No, the title i believe was in classic or it was introduced in the start of BC.
---
However classic low lvling quest gives alot of reputation.
---
So taking your lvl 60 down outside of Thunder bluff where you anyway was delivering hundreds of cloths. Would probably get you the rep you needed, or just going to all areas where there was some Thunder Bluff presence. 
---
With the Mage i went to far route for lvling and even did quite alot of grey quests (Most quests was Green). Before entering the dark Portal. (The goal was to avoid the hassle of so many people lvling from 60-70.)
---
What’s the point??
---
If they get Whirlwind Axe before 35 they'll definitely stay. Makes a warrior's life much nicer.
---
30/0/21 shammy is usually mentioned in these types of posts. Can't speak from experience
---
&gt; Healing was pretty easy.
---
It's vanilla.. keeping someone healed up is not hard.. not going oom while doing it is the ahrd part.
---
**&lt;Crab Bucket&gt; [Alliance] EU [RP-PvP] English**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **RP-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent auction, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
On our discord you can find info on how to join.
---
https://discord.gg/qN9ywMy
---
I guess this only works, if you have no WoW experience at all. Or at best no MMO experience or at very best no online game experience (my case back in wrath :')  )
---
That’s a little dramatic. It’s definitely close to being ready. None of the bugs reported, including that hunter auto shot one, are very bad and I imagine will be fairly easy fixes over the next 3 months. 
---
I played a hunter on the stress test and the auto attack bug was more an inconvenience than what I would call game-breaking. 
---
The bigger issues that need to be ironed out are related to layering, which they will need to do during future stress tests, and is also only in the game temporarily. 
---
I’m glad they’re testing it too, but saying they’re not even close is a bit of a stretch.
---
Hunter - Pulling... Sounds about right
---
That's probably the only reason I would like to have beta access. Would love to take part in the huge wPvP battles and WSG madness.
---
Correct. Some may need some minor tweaks though
---
Like I said I'm glad you can do w/e you want, but there's a reason why good players like fighting good players and bad players take any fight they can win.
---
Go Warlock, they aren't one of the most popular classes so you will stand out more and they are great at PvP
---
isn't leashing the mechanic that mobs have a certain starting point from which they would only follow a certain distance?
---
only honest answer here
---
Its highly developed and fleshed out? Ofc. It is. But not what we as a classic community want. Sadly
---
[KILLER QUEEN...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/214/595/c33.png) is what I've named it.
---
also I remember it to be much slower, as walking instead of running
---
The last one is exactly where I want to be.
---
I spent a couple hours on Sat during a family cookout with my brother planning out what we're going to roll. What professions we're getting, what our end game goals are. It was great.
---
We're both going to solo our main (Orc Warlock herb/alch for me, Orc Hunter mine/engi for him), but have a couple alts that we just play together Warrior-me Priest-him. We're really excited about the group potential we'll have with a tank/healer duo. Jumping straight into any dungeon we want nearly instantly just by putting a request for 3 DPS will be awesome.

stop on by and say hi
---
Its a struggle at times for sure. 
---
The experience isnt horrible though. I love warrior-leveling. Its very engaging.
---
It's extremely exaggerated. I've leveled several warriors, and yes, it is often painful, but it's mostly because they're so weak in PvP for a long time. for normal grinding, I would rank rogue as worse than warrior, although with more survival spells if shit hits the fan.
---
I remember it like that as well.
---
&gt; This isn't 08. Reddit isn't b.
---
Keep up.
---
Me 2
---
its almost as if i was reply to his actual comment, where he specified warrior.
---
People don't care, they just go along with it. And the only ones having a problem with it is people here and the official forums. I'm 33 and I love watching the big streamers do whatever they can to entertain the viewers, they can stop watching whenever they think it's too much witch isn't many it seems.
---
I made a quick video on why you should think outside the box once Classic launches.   
---
TLDW: Make your own routes - and manipulate guides. Everyone will be using Joana's and Brian Kopp's guides, avoid those zones to get ahead of the pack. Spend your time leveling by grinding profession mats that come up a lot in leveling guides to capitalize.
---
Got all the expansions boxes (even for US reg because we played US in TBC with our family overseas) but that's the only I took with me when I moved for uni to another country
---
Decursive should work, it's essentially just a mouseover macro. You could even make one yourself if you look it up, then just hover the frame and hit a keybind
---
It won't.
---
The ambassador title wasnt in the game untill wrath and the introduction of achivments.
---
Doing lowlevel quests for rep aint as effective as farming cloth in vanilla since you didnt get the full rep amount when the quests are gray.
---
I remmember this cause i did try your method in vanilla but i ended up farming huge amount of runecloth for my tiger since it was clearly superior.
---
A quicker way is the AQ event but thats along way down the road.
---
I'm sure everyone will enjoy the game in their own way.
---
Do you have an active sub? Dont tell me you subbed only to get a beta invite
---
that was a core part of wow vanilla though?
---
Pervert
---
Those are speedrun times that don't include trash up to garr, and up to the corehounds fyi
---
you people are cancer. it's not cool, it's not funny. it's cancer.
---
More DOTS!!!!
---
Oh really? I remember trying it with my Hunter and i belived it worked.
---
Oh well, the point still stands, you can run from Orc starting area and go to Mulgore if you want to aim for Exalted instead of doing all the farming.
---
Wanding means attacking with your wand.
---
For most casters while leveling early, wands &gt; spells. In endgame, the main skill of any caster is mana management and optimal movement. Mages have tools to manage their mana in Evocation and Mana Gems. Warlocks have Life Tap. All other casters have nothing.
---
The big thing with mana regen in classic is the "5 second rule." Mana regen ticks happen on a set timer and only when you have not cast a spell for 5 seconds.
---
clickbaiting on reddit, what have we become..
---
Pulling hard-hitting elites/bosses to cities is literally one of the main things people like(d) about vanilla.
---
 Would buy :)
---
Yeah, wands are a ranged auto-attacking weapon. Unlike other ranged weapons, wands don't require ammunition, do some form of magical damage, and don't have a minimum range.
---
It took years for me to be able to complete my profession recipes. There’s only a couple enchanting/tailoring/cooking recipes/patterns I’m missing. I’ve spent huge amounts just to have the pattern knowing I’d never use it..lol. 
---
Friggin ocd..
---
I don't quite get it. why do you have a problem with leashing being in classic when you agree it was part of vanilla?
---
I don't bother redifing A and D as strafes. If you right click your mouse and press A or D the turn becomes a strafe. I've got my right mouse button clicked pretty often now that i think about it, but its a good habit to keep your target in front of you. 
---
Also leaving A and D as turns allows you to navigate one hand in cities if you're eating or drinking with your right hand.

# &lt;Informal&gt; [NA][A][PvE][Semi-Hardcore]  MORNING EST
---
INTRO:This is a brand new Semi-Hardcore guild being made from the ground up. I am looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. It does not matter if you are new to classic or a veteran, All I want are dedicated players willing to do what it takes to down bosses. If you can do this, I want you on the team.
---
**GOAL:**
---
\-week 2 or 3 MC clear
---
\-Clear all content quickly and efficiently
---
(example: phase 1 should be 1 raid night, except for off day ONY)
---
\-Clear Naxx, full T3 guild before BC release
---
**EXPECTATIONS:** I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. I want everyone on and ready 15 minutes before raid begins. During progression I expect full consumables to help us get the kills we need. 
---
**LOOT:** Council and roll decay. Some loot is too important to be simply bought or rolled for. Others are not so much. So we will be using a mix of these 2 systems.

PlusFyraSex är en nystartad Svensk guild inför WoW: Classic med målet att klara av första raid tieren inom en rimlig tidsram och skapa en stark kärngrupp av spelare som är hungriga.
---
Därefter kommer slutmålet vara att bli den bästa svenska guilden på servern utifrån våra förutsättningar.

Vi ämnar att rekrytera en hyfsad meta influerad roster men är öppen för ett begränsat antal spelare som vill spela specs som är mindre önskade i en raid miljö t.ex. Ret, Moonkin och Feral (Tank / DPS).
---
Med den pågående rekryteringen är målet att föra samman cirka 50+ personer (Då det är alltid någon som inte kommer att nå max level) som är taggade inför Classics release och är redo att göra sitt allra bästa angående att veta så mycket som möjligt om den klass de kommer att spela, levla till 60 och förbereda sig inför de kommande raidsen med Pre-Raid BiS, Consumables, buffs och självklart läsa på om bossarna vi kommer stöta på i de kommande raidsen tillsammans.
---
Vi behöver även folk som är intresserade utav att ta större ansvar och till exempel bidra extra till guilden som klass officerare.

Then every guide out there is wrong apparently. There is a reason why combat swords is said to be the strongest spec for raids. The damage meters I've seen during vanilla raiding confirm it, too. Only in the vael boss fight daggers pull ahead. That might change in later contents but at list until the end of BWL, swords do more damage. That does not mean that daggers are garbage for PvE, just not as good as swords.
---
And just because something else works, does not invalidate any of it.
---
You've got it backwards. Leashing means that you can't kite far.
---
Leashing = no kiting.
---
No leashing = free kiting.
---
If you want to raid "some times" you will have to go healer as priest. You will have to constantly switch between PvE and PvP spec for priest if you want to be "serious about PvP". While people say Shadow priest is godlike in 1v1, they are out of mana after 1 fight and don't have much mobility in world PvP.
---
Warlock is kinda bad with bad gear. You might be able to kill enemies with your dots but you will die too. You need amazing gear for it to become good. I also suggest against playing Warlock on Alliance side for PvP. I mained Ally Warlock in retail classic and WotF sucks as much as you would suspect.
---
Hunter is best for world PvP and random PvP IMO. Guilds will bring like 3 Hunters to all raids too. Hunters also are amazing for duels. Saying "hunters don't scale well with gear" is also misleading. Yes, in raids their dps don't increase as much as for instance Warlock, but in World PvP a naxx geared hunter can Aimed Shot + Multi Shot + Arcane shot and 1shot classes.
---
 Absolutely legendary!!! Makes me wanna roll alliance
---
Agreed. Warrior was my first toon, and while leveling took a while for me, that was mostly due to my lack of experience, rather than class ability. 
---
Also, let’s not forget that class balancing wasn’t really a thing in Vanilla. Warrior’s were the *only* viable tanking class. So, in general, everyone is gonna need warriors to make it to 60.
---
as in, Kazzak is leashed? I think OP meant the normal leashing mechanic, not the absolute "can't be kited". besides, they did fix Kazzak on a leash during vanilla.
---
And because hunter's mark stacked, apparently. 3 hunters would've dealt crazy dps
---
who?
---
Everything feels too weak tbh
---
You sound just salty that you are missing out on the fun.
---
The server I am on active and has none of that Nazi shit. Also values seem right to me. Maybe there's something a little bit off here and there but it sure feels right. I don't know how people can be so anti private servers when they have come such a long way I am really looking forward to classic to be on an official server again but I see no reason for the pserver hate
---
They apparently filed a bug report for that.
---
You do your best to not run out of mana. Mana management is big part of the game. Ooming people is how you have to kill some players at times.
---
When you run out, or at anytime, you can use your wand. They don’t cost any mana. It will auto-attack fire every two seconds or so. Certain wands are better than others and they do different types of damage. They do not hit like as hard as spells but they are still quite viable in a lot of scenarios. Priests use wands the most often out of all the casters as a way to conserve mana for heals. Mages don’t really want to be caught so OOM they have to wand, it’s bad spot but def better than nothing. Warlocks have life tap so OOMing is not as big of an issue but they can still throw some wand shots in while Dots are ticking.
---
Nobody knows for sure if Kazzak is leashed yet, as world bosses aren't on the beta yet, and nobody is high enough level anyway. But it is very likely that he is leashed, since they added that for him during vanilla.
---
Mobs have their leash range increased (but not reset fully) when they land a non-ranged attack on you. That's neither new nor interesting and I'm not sure why OP would make a video on it if that's what he is trying to show.
---
Add windfury totem
---
Are most warrior BiS ranged weapons different from hunters BiS?
---
Guess it will be a 50:50 - the first few weeks will be crowded, until people that never played classic quit again,  because it's too slow/too boring/too hard and move back to retail.  There will probably be a big core of players wanting to experience classic again, because they didnt play Private Servers - and the people that are swapping over from Privates.
---
I'm interested in how hard the population on some servers will die when the big boom is over tho.
---
I thought it was about the backpedaling?
---
In the 10-12 hrs you play a week, you will be able to raid in a casual lower end guild no issues. You will need to be smart with your time though, which means you'll need a game plan every time you log on.
---
If you prefer solo, you're going to miss out on the end game. But if you just like levelling and grinding gear, go Hunter and you can basically play in the open world with no issues.
---
Just to give you an idea.
---
LVL 60 dungeons give you pre raid gear. They are roughly 1-2 hours to complete with a basic group and take around 30 mins to an hour to assemble if you don't know anyone on the server.
---
You will be able to pug MC, BWL, Ony, ZG and AQ20 with ease. They will take roughly 2-3 hours. This give you purple raid tier loot. This is down to luck sometimes you'll haveshit groups. But these raids aren't hard for players who have experience.
---
Of you want to take on aq40 and naxx, you'll need to be in a raiding guild. This will take more effort from You, because you will need to prepare heavily for this. The raids aren't hard to the experienced, but they need time and prep.
---
With pvp, you will not be getting high ranks. You will get some medium ranks no worries. But no high ranks.
---
But classic wow is not a solo game. The onlynsolo you will be doing is grinding mobs and levelling. That's it. If you do not group or do raids you will not get good loot. The game doesn't hand out gear.
---
Are you sure this wasn’t in BC?
---
erm, you mean the boat from 'Ratchet'? Oh yeah, these are the real memories. And as additional challenge there was a chance, the boat despawning, but you're not phasing --&gt; Fatigue --&gt; Rep. costs  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Key words: Blood Elf, Ambassador.   
---
Rep rewards from quests were buffed to the high heavens after Vanilla. I watched a beta stream the other day and saw someone turn in [Underground Assault](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=2040). It's listed as giving 500 rep with the entire faction because that's the value in TBC+, but it only gave the guy 100 rep with Stormwind and Gnomeregan on the beta. It's going to be 100% impossible to reach exalted with any major city without Morrowgrain and/or cloth turn-ins.
---
Really banned? Its part of the game to have fun i think. For me its ok.
---
You have to play gnome.
---
Rip.

**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE server Horde NA Casual Raiding**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
We are all excited for this release.  For some it’s about nostalgia, for others it’s about experiencing classic for the first time.  Regardless of why we are here we can all agree we are here to have fun. We are a casual guild but that does not mean we aren’t aiming to succeed.  We want to create a comfortable atmosphere so we can all experience the game in a positive way. Play what you want, play how you want, play when you want.  We are accepting and open to players of all types.
---
Classic WoW relied heavily on individual and guild reputation.  We will strive to make Moist synonymous with quality: quality players, quality attitudes, quality experiences.  Anyone who encounters a member of Moist should leave thinking that we are knowledgeable, respectful, fun, and all around awesome!
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
We are planning to run two separate raid IDs, one on Thursdays at 6 pm PST (9 pm EST) and the other on Saturdays 6 pm PST (9 pm EST), for targeting 40 player content. By having two raid groups, we hope to be flexible for people’s schedules while also providing a large player base for smaller group content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule. 
---
**Contact:**
---
If you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day organization, then please message @Slaugth#9941 on discord or even a DM here on reddit with a discord contact (I don't check reddit as often so please be patient).
---
Why cant i be a human lock?
---
On the topic of wands once youre eligible to go to Blackfathom Deeps make sure to grab the [Gravestone Scepter](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=7001), its the best wand you'll get your hands on for 10+ levels, and IMO worth doing BFD for this alone.
---
how do they know noone else on the beta did it world first? ;)
---
Does every caster only use wands ? What if you have a stave can you still wand people with it ?
---
"F*CK!", Then he kick the floor and activate the macro.
---
"YES!!!"
---
You can, but the gnome racial is significantly better from a pvp aspect
---
I have tested your guide along with others of the private server community, perhaps I am bit harsh and could word things better but at the end of the day your guide post 30 does not work.
---
If you feel different then put your money where your mouth is and post proof perhaps a video play through done on correct servers?
---
Here's an idea for being able to credit all the authors. Don't call the guide after your own alias when multiple people contribute to the content.
---
Well i wont play gnome.
---
Yes, every race and class pls :)
---
Damn wtf is happening in this thread
---
I hope you have a weal aura that as soon as any loot drop you start spamming hunter weapon in chat and whsiper anyone who got a drop u need?
---
Have you never played a warrior? Changing stance changes all abilities, making it a modifier...
---
I was 13-14 years old and except for the first few weeks and until I started raiding I was under parental controls with 2 hours a day, every day of the week. It took me from the end of November till the end of may to ding 60. I plan to do it in two weeks after launch given that I'm able to take that time off from work. I don't plan on doing the mountain of mistakes that I did while leveling back in 2005 - 2006.
---
Everyone would rush to 60 asap. Not sure why you'd only mention streamers
---
I have macro button under my space-bar, the most underutilized place for macro buttons ever, wish more keyboards have them
---
the fuck
---
"All Types"... uh, couldn't think of another one.
---
Too bad they can't equip anything that drops x-D
---
Just play by ourselves until you get to the crossroads
---
You'll play together for 490180398123 hours from level 15+ to level 60, let her play alone for at least a week, she won't divorce you for it dude.
---
In classic you'll be lucky to hit exalted with your own faction by 60 - you don't get rep for grey quests and you definitely don't get hundreds of rep for killing a mob.
---
I've stopped playing pservers for a while now. I don't feel like having my progress reset again.
---
"i don't know hoe people can hate servers riddled with bugs, corruption and nazis"
---
seems strange. 
---
"the values seem right to me" good luck readjusting to classic.
---
Plenty of times, small fixes. Wands being fixed is one (if activiated during GCD it deactivated it self instantly, fixed now). 
---
There has not been a huge patch that fix a lot of big bad stuff though, guess we'll see that after the next stress test.
---
Its almost like I didn't say your question is perfectly valid for a warrior, yet the validity of your question has no bearing to the point he was trying to make. He used it just as an example of a talent that strongly favour swords over axes when it comes to extra attacks. And I pointed out, that a talent with the exact same name and function exists on rogue talent trees, so that people would know that un-optimal talent choices are not the only reason why swords are the way to go for extra attacks.
---
Yes all casters have a slot for a wand. No a staff will only melee auto-attack, not fire ranged bolts like a wand, nor hit as hard.
---
Hyper Daniel's Electronic Video Gaming.
---
Pvp healing is FAR better as holy/Prot build than holy/ret
---
Not if you are fighting rogues ;p
---
Mages priests and locks do. In classic you had a third slot for weapons, so you might have one hand, off hand and wand for example
---
I for one are gonna take my time enjoying levelling again to 60 and im sure im not the only one.
---
The fact that it had copper in it makes me believe the loot table was working as intended, and you really just had the one in a million chance of every item rolled to be a health potion. 
---
Loot can appear super scuffed. I remember killing a random wolf in Elwynn and it dropping three Malachite, might have been TBC at that point.
---
Leveling a warrior is great..you get to visit every single graveyard in game.
---
Warrior is way more “all types” than Shaman. Shaman is a very specific class fantasy. Author needs a smack upside the head
---
I think they nailed the mage as well. Living on the edge, playing with fire (sometimes literally), get frostlocked - you’re dead.
---
Also, I can’t unsee the Skyrim font.
---
The wand goes in your ranged slot
---
ArkInventory. It is in the list
---
Hell no, no mana tide
---
I See, but i didnt think it was possible to do BWL+MC Farm in 1 day
---
Totally agree - also makes you tanky AF.  Your only weakness becomes casters as rogues/warriors just can’t do shit to you as holy/Prot
---
"Those who love to win."
---
Awwww yis.
---
That's all I did in vanilla, and I had a blast. I never hit level cap and just derped around exploring and experiencing.
---
- MM Hunter
---
- SM/Ruin Warlock (tho I preffer heavy destruction for PvP)
---
- 1/29/21 Druid
---
- Holy Paladin (healing in PvP is fun too)
---
One downside is a third of the pvpers you fight will have WotF. Have you considered Shadow Priest? Again you'll have to deal with WotF (not as badly I don't think) but you get a choice of dwarf/human rather than gnome/human.
---
You can’t feign death + Trap in BGs (feign doesn’t drop combat)
---
Of course not but the majority of people will level as fast as possible. That has nothing to do with streamers
---
I have but i feel like as a priest people will be asking for a healer &amp; i refuse to heal. Ill only be shadow, what u think?
---
It's cool, but this is only a challenge because they have been really under-levelled. The gameplay meta/experience that exists on the beta is entirely unique to the beta due to the level 30 cap, it's quite far removed from what classic will be, you won't find many players wanting to spend hours trying to brute force dungeons at much lower than intended levels, and twinking will be restricted to PVP due to no experience lock.  
---
What I'm saying is it's cool and the vibes are genuine, but people shouldn't get overhyped for classic based on things that are very unique to the level 30 cap beta, they won't even get to experience.
---
pretty impressiv but u need to keep in mind they all have nearly all BIS for lvl 30 xD
---
Again, can't speak from experience, but mana tide necessity could depend on which party you're in and how casual your guild is.
---
Yeah, even on pservers, it has been a time and a half trying to get people to wait and let me get a couple sunders on the primary target before they start going balls to the wall.
---
I'm also convinced they are somehow filtering the skull from their perception.
---
I recommend playing Warcraft 3! It's a really nice game and it will enhance your experience of WoW Classic =)
---
Lol dought it will work.
---
I never said i don't like classic, I'm for sure gonna play it. 
---
I just don't get why we need to bash retail in order to justify classic servers. Theres plenty of fun stuff to do in retail if you think otherwise than it's just not your game and you should quit instead of crying on reddit.
---
I levelled my paladin as holy, and then TBC came out before I was 60 but I'm looking for a similar build. One where I can fill several roles without having to respec all the time.
---
My question is are the 3 points in Improved Seal of The Crusader worth it? Is Seal of Command not your main damage output? Or is this choice based on the improvement to the judgement?
---
Edit: Also due to my interest in PvP I was thinking of taking Repentance over Divine Favor.
---
I did this with my guild on the Alliance side, hiding in the Orgrimmar-Undercity Zeppelin, and it was also excellent. Only raid I ever saw from anyone else though was the Booty Bay-Ratchet Boat, surprisingly.
---
Gnome is better.
---
Gnome has better DPS in PvE, Undead has nothing for PvE.
---
I would concider Escape Artist slightly better than WotF because of the cooldown difference.
---
Then again, when we look at the "PvP meta", Warlocks and Priests are concidered on the top, so WotF &gt; Escape Artist against those classes. 
---
Paladin freedom is horrible for mages. Think about meeting a rogue with freedom. Outside of freedom though, they are easy.
---
Shamans also "counter" mages, but in a different way. Purge ruins your Ice Armor IF he focuses you. Grounding Totem absorbs your spell, but it's kind of a rare issue in grouped PvP.
---
No horde racials counter mage. The alliance racial that counter mage, is gnomes.
---
That's fair enough! I'm looking at healers because it seems a bit more interactive, but I'll probably just end up playing both anyway
---
The 250 / 350 rep for quests was standard in vanilla was it not?
---
The starting areas has quite alot of those quests.
---
While i agree that the added quests from the blood elf areas aided me in reaching exalted. 
---
However this was just after the launch of BC. (And ambassador title was the nost natural thing for me to connect with being exalted in all factions).
---
However i concede the point of not following the Beta enough to make a proper numbers game of it. Reaching exalted or not. What is clear is that its still alot of repu from their starting area. And that choosing to lvl in areas with high tauren presence will aid you in getting the kodo.
---
Great vid and good info. Appreciate you putting it out there for the community! Subbed.
---
nobody plays shield slam anyway, sunder still generates more threat
---
people will ask  you to heal and at first you will say no, then you'll be like ok just this one time and then you'll burn out not loving wow anymore because you always heal.
---
I wanted to do something like this for dota/csgo but felt it was way too trihard and id improve more as a player by just getting use to the macros
---
That doesn't mean that OP is wrong.
---
I'm going to find out which realm all the streamers are playing on then i'm going to stay the fuck away from it
---
\*in raids, but with the raised debuff slots in classic compared to retail vanilla you should be fine in 5 mans.
---
opposite faction of esfand
---
Then I bind all my abilities to permutations of F.
---
F 
---
Duel won
---
Hehe the 350 rep for the scorpion was the "boss" of the starting area for the orcs and trolls. 
---
Quest was to kill it while also killing the other scorpions and i remember it being crazy amount of rep for a lvl 4 mob.
---
Ofc it will, they didn't think enough players would want RP-PvP and they've been proved wrong. It was them who asked us to be vocal about it =)
---
Someone should make a list so we know where NOT to go.
---
Type 'soda wow' into google. Life pro tip right here.
---
Or kinda pathetic
---
Ironman: only white armor and death = delete char
---
\*Those who LIVE TO WIN
---
I wonder how far you could get haha. Mage kite maybe?
---
In vanilla I solely played shadow spec but to be honest I was mostly ran with a shadow spec without shadowform so I could heal as well.
---
This time round I'll switch between tri-spec and shadow but I dont know which one I'll eventually feel forced into playing.
---
bwl+mc in 1 hour, ok :D
---
Put your question in the search bar and see what happens.
---
I would love to get access to the beta to look for bugs and glitches.
---
If anyone knows of any streamer that arent tryharding and looking for world firsts or BiS items and instead actually do proper beta testing, please let me know.
---
Up until late 40s you are the 5th DPS as healer. If you are only healing you will usually have lots of down time. You should assist with DPS and earth shock to interrupt casters unless you think you wont manage with mana. Once you get a feel for it you might be even able to out DPS the DMG dealers on many pulls. Roles are not so set in stone in Classic. It's all about your synergy with the party. I used to assist the rogue in taking down one enemy while the tank picks up the rest of the group. Once we would finish the thank would have enough threat so we could comfortably switch without pulling aggro. This worked from SM up until ST. After that we just split up since we differed in levels too much.
---
Frostball hits harder than anything else so you just spam it until the boss dies
---
You like PvE servers, no need to be rude about it
---
If you don't have these you're a pathetic normie
---
You don't know shit.
---
Why do people always ask this?  How fucking retarded do you have to be to think these characters don’t get wiped?
---
https://wowchallenges.com/index.php?Show=IronManRules
---
Damn, Classic WoW was never this easy.
---
Fingers cross they fix it, thank god for a BETA.
---
Not saying it will be easy, but many guilds are looking to raid more casually and not minmax. Find a guild where you make friends with people and you can get a raidspot as most specs, if you find a guild that only cares about progression and minmaxing, shadow is gonna be hard to pull off.
---
Yep that's true, downside might be a 5-10% more expensive lvl40 mount as you may not have the revered/honoured discount.
---
You seem to not have understood what I mean. I meant modifier in a sense like shift or alt are modifiers. So essentially giving you a whole new set of buttons.
---
So instead of just getting the three buttons for the stances out of the pedals, you'd get 3 times however many keys you normally use. So let's say you use 1 to 5, q and e as your regular keys, which are 7 buttons. If the pedals are modifiers than you'd get a total of 21 new keys to bind. Compare that to the three you get from binding the stances, which obviously give you a new set of abilities as well.
---
just took me to some wierd mountain dew promo
---
You don’t lose reck stacks when swapping weapon as long as you’ve not swung your current weapon since gaining the stacks
---
No, it's all really low rep. The highest I've seen so far on beta was 100 for regular quests where you actually have to kill/loot things. Breadcrumbs etc. always seem to be 25.
---
Useless items in a dead world with boring story and gameplay.
---
Yeah. I have tons of rare shit on my retail account but I still havnt played actively since MoP simply because retail is a bad game.
---
No, you cannot get banned for playing the game.
---
I think the top 5% and bottom 5%, in terms of how "hardcore" they are, will not enjoy Classic. The entitled 15 year old that just wants his titanforged loot every day without seeing his HP bar decrease will not enjoy it. The Mythic+ pushing Mythic raiding Rank 1 won't enjoy it either.
---
The 90% remaining playerbase will love it.
---
^This pretty much. During classic content drought I will probably just play one of the hundreds of games I have on my steam back-log rather than going back to retail wow.
---
Retail wow is simply a bad game.
---
*you didnt get the full rep amount when the quests are gray.*
---
Yes but it was changed later (i think still in vanilla so should be in 1.12) and currently it gives full amount of rep for other factions quests that are gray(i asked some person who plays beta to check it)
---
I first played WoW in Wrath. Shortly after I started, Cata dropped and I really didn't like it so I stopped. Later I played some on Wrath pservers. Then on Vanilla pservers. I really liked what I've seen so I can't wait for Classic. (I've even created a "no rush" guild. :)
---
Personally I just play what I like. Be it new or "old". I think Vanilla/Classic is a wonderful game which has the possibility to be enjoyed by many, including many who never played it.
---
However I also think that a lot of people don't give games the chance they deserve. Most will just play what their friends play. If they play Fortnite, they'll play Fortnite. A lot of people can also hang up on the graphics not being "modern" enough. All in all I think there will be many new players but much fewer than what the game would get if everyone approached it with an open mind.
---
Why on earth would anyone make a troll mage?
---
Planetastic!
---
So, all i need just get subscription? No need to buy standart wow( all expansions expect last one) or BFA?
---
I and my friend are curious. He doesn't play Wow for very long time and think about return in Classic.
---
thats just...really pointless in a comment about warriors, well done another class has a talent, it's not relevant to the point that a WARRIOR would never spec that far into arms for that talent, which was what my comment was about. the point he was making was warrior, he said warrior, rogues cant even equip axes so...idk what youre trying to say, rogues dont factor into this at all.
---
So that one shot PvP build won't be there in classic?
---
That's a lot of buttons for pressing holy light. Then again you are very small.
---
Next volume never.
---
Are you sure you’re not remembering shockadin from BC rather than classic?  Because holy shock in classic is straight garbage.  It got buffed by 2.5x as much dmg in BC.
---
Probably not.
---
Though, Blizzard always reserves the right to do anything they want, so every rule ever written has a "gotcha" in it as if a legal team wrote it.
---
"Ongoing Harassment
---
The Ongoing Harassment policy does not apply when there is a PvP resolution available on a PvP realm, as physical confrontations are considered a facet of PvP combat and players in opposing factions are unable to communicate verbally. Characters have the ability to address their conflicts through combat and GMs will only involve themselves in extreme circumstances."
---
Vrakthris
---
Blizz support
---
"When it comes to PVP Realms, it's unlikely that In-Game Support will intervene when players are subjected to corpse camping. Instead, we encourage players to band together with your faction to bring down the person who is after you. Creating a character on a PVP realm carries with it the inherent danger of being attacked out in the wild, often repeatedly."
---
No, the alliance harbor boat.
---
This feels more like a zodiac :)
---
A true success story
---
Not from a Jedi.
---
You pounce that soon? More like 5%.
---
If they dont, they would be smart to put them on a test realm.
---
I have got nothing to prove to you unfortunately. The guide is a free resource for you, feel free to use it if you like. When you tested the guide did you do the Scarlet Monastery option I added. Did you do the Zul'Farrak option I added? Did you do the zones in a different order with the changes in quest lines that that required that I added? Did you do the Linken's quest chain that I added? Did you do the Onyxia attunement that I added? Did you do the Scholomance attunement that I added? Did you do the entire zone of Swamp of Sorrows that I added? Did you do the entire zone of Silithus that I added? Or the literally hundreds of other things that I added?
---
When you’re so bad at a video game that you need foot pedals, the game has a global cool down so why the fuck would you need foot pedals?! Oh god...
---
Depends a bit on your class. 
---
Warlocks have a spell called Life Tap which converts health into mana, this means they can just continually get their mana back as long as they can get healed. In the world they can use drain life and various other healing mechanics and in raids they rely on the healers to keep them up, which usually isn't a problem.
---
Mages can conjure mana gems before the fight which restore some mana, but you can only carry one of each rank and they share cooldown. They also have a spell called Evocation which gives them a huge amount of mana back as long as they stand still and channel it. Evocation has a pretty huge cooldown though so you can usually only use it once on an encounter. One of the worst things that can happen for a mage is being mind controlled by the boss or trash right before a boss and being forced to blow the evocation while at 80% mana.   
---
Frost mages are quite mana effective so they rarely run out of mana. Fire mages though can burn through their mana really quick and they have to be careful with mana management. This is exacerbated by the Ignite talent which basically produced a dot of 40% of your crit's damage on the boss. It gets refreshed whenever another mage gets a crit so you can get absurd amount of dot damage, but if the mages go oom they can't keep the ignite rolling and a big part of their dps comes from ignite.   
---
If they run dry they just use their wand to dps. 
---
A wand btw is a third weapon slot that only mages, warlocks and priests can equip that essentially is a ranged weapon, similar to bows for hunters, warriors and rogues. Their dps is usually quite low compared to spell casting, but during leveling it can be pretty close or even higher. So priests usually wand their way to 60, they even have talents that increase the damage of their wands.
---
Priests get most of their mana from spirit. But spirit only regens your mana when you're not casting. There's something called the 5 second rule which basically means if you don't cast anything for 5 seconds, your mana regen from spirit will kick in. Priests and druids have talents that lets 15% of their mana regen from spirit continue while casting. Both classes' 3-set T2 bonus give them another 15%, which means even in Naxx many priests and druids try and hold on to that 3-set bonus. Druids have a spell called Innervate which acts similarly to Evocation, but can be cast on other players. During vanilla these would usually be reserved for the priests, but on modern private servers they usually keep them for themselves instead because people finally understand how powerful druids are for healing.  
---
Sidenote: if you play as a feral, or very rarely balance, you can do dps/tank and still innervate a priest which adds to the utility. If you run out of mana you basically have to pop mana potions or items called Demonic Runes and Dark Runes. They convert some of your health into mana, similarly to warlocks' Life Tap, and because it costs less mana to heal up that health than the mana you get, they are useful for keeping you going.  
---
Sidenote: In Naxxramas there is a boss called Thaddius whose main ability is to buff you with bonus damage as long as you stand in the right spot, this bonus damage applies to Demonic and Dark Runes and you can easily kill yourself with them.   
---
If you run out of mana as a priest or druid you are pretty fucked. If you are alliance you can wand/hit the boss for some mana since paladins put up seal of wisdom on the boss which gives mana back to all who hit. Not a lot, but still something. Paladins are alliance only though, so I don't know what horde players do. 
---
This btw is one of the reasons why balance druids are so crap in vanilla. They have no mana regen, no mana recovery talents so they just go oom within a minute. Shadowpriests are in a similar situation but not as bad. A balance druid can keep decent dps for maybe 50-70 seconds, a shadowpriest can keep good dps for maybe 2 minutes and decent dps for at most 4 minutes. On fights like Patchwerk where you are just standing still and unloading everything you got, shadowpriests and sometimes even the mages run dry eventually. It's not uncommon to see the mages on top of the dps meter for the first few minutes, then slowly fall down as they have to wand while the warlocks can just keep spamming spells due to Life Tap. I've heard that elemental and enhancement shamans are in a similar boat but I don't actually know.
---
Paladins get almost nothing from spirit because they don't have any talents or set bonuses which gives them mana regen while casting. Instead they get 100% of their mana back when they crit. Hence spell crit is extremely useful for paladins. Their main spell; Flash of Light, is probably the most mana effective heal in the game, it doesn't heal for a lot though so their throughput isn't always the best. It's a quick cast though and thus paladins are very strong healers. Once they get AQ and Naxx gear they have so much crit that it's essentially impossible to go oom. 
---
I'm not very familiar with shamans so I can't say how they work. 
---
Hunters can feign death to get out of combat and then drink to get their mana back.
---
Well gl hope it works out for you guys.
---
Battle shout doesn't generate threat on beta.
---
I rode a kodo as an Orc... the grind was real
---
In Classic, you have both a melee and ranged weapon slot. The wand goes in the ranged slot. Only cloth casters can use them though - only Priests, Mages and Warlocks.
---
IIRC, Druids, Paladins and Shamans aren't capable of using any ranged weapons at all. However, late game they get other items that occupy the slot (I only started in BC and never played Shaman though, so my memory may be off.)
---
Stamina.
---
I found a discord with people from my country on it. I don't really know any of them IRL but I am just gonna roll the PvP server they decide on. I won't worry about finding a raiding guild until I am actually max lvl.
---
The dude was providing knowledge to people. Every reply is not exclusively for the commenter.  Go outside.
---
I know. I don't understand it either. I only know it works differently and can be turned on or off.
---
Thanks for this insight, it's very helpful. Gives some depth to what people says when X is ok, and the other one says it's not.
---
What's the 109 countries?
---
...Why would whether or not it is a desktop make any difference to the subject?
---
Huh... that would explain my surprise when that my new character so easily reached exalted with them all. 
---
Doh i did try and do ALL quests ingame as Greens, barely had any left and very few was done as grey. So i thought that was the reason.
---
Grinding scholomance to own the libs
---
I got no education, no job and no social life. That is how I managed my assignments and tests. I might have a job offer now in July, but I'm gonna have to decline because Classic is coming in August.
---
Easy - 7 years for a 4 year degree.  Not complaining tho.  At this stage in life I’ve got a job that pays me 3x what I ever thought I’d earn in my life and I work from home 4 days a week which gives me plenty of time for gaming during the day. 
---
Life’s good and can’t wait for Classic!
---
I get the feeling there's going to be more warrior saturation this time around.
---
I don't think I've seen Snutz lose a single duel yet.
---
Make sure to report it, it might be a sign of something else going wrong.
---
Druids have probably the best single target aggro, are on par with wars fighting up to 3 targets and are worse than wars when there are more than 3 targets. Paladins, well... Yeah, that's probably not going to go very well.
---
Sodapoppin
---
Haha, great story. Love it!
---
Go goblin em good
---
There were a few recipes that this happened to. I loaded up on them as well and made a killing (&gt;100k) in 2011.  I think Lion Steak was my best seller.
---
Back in vanilla wow I was a God among mortals in pvp with a warlock. Since I have hopped on the hype train for classic I have been looking for a guide for my build and to my surprise I haven't seen one like mine.
---
Admiditly I took this build from the top pvp player on my server at the time. Literally the more foes I would go against the higher my probability for survival and win. In short siphon life and buff it to the max and keep it on all of the foes, sack the voidwalker for health per second. Keep them feared off of you.
---
I'm going off memory from years ago so this might not be 100% accurate but its pretty close if not: https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/warlock-talents/?tal=55022032122010050205034010050100000000000000000000
---
Had those as a main tank back in TBC loved it
---
Streamer enthusiasm on point
---
I'm not even playing the retail, nor I like it; if anything this post is in favor of people who have fought for return of proper Vanilla-WotLK nights...not sure how that makes me a retail apologist 😂 And yeah, I know you're not the one who said it, it's just that I don't understand what the dude meant with that comment...
---
Yeah, exactly this. There are some bosses, that will give you a hard time, when not going optimal, but as long as everyone knows, what to do... You'll clear most of the content.
---
Is this based on your xp of vanilla or private servers? Not disagreeing with you, just don’t remember anything other than warrior being viable but it was 12-13 years ago so what do I know?  🤷🏼‍♂️
---
So I assume the above is what you added to Varraks video guide, and you believe this entitles you to name the guide "sages alliance leveling guide" and copy wright the information at the bottom of every page. LOL
---
If it is the kind of thing you enjoy, you should give EVE online a shot.

---
Recorded on the same day, of course this is on a private Server with buffed values on the Mobs but maybe incorrect scaling on spells etc.
---
But i don't think it will vary much on Classic.
---
Fun times that made us wish for captain placeholder to return :)
---
As a crafter, I prefer BfA to WoD. I make my money through making stuff and garrisons gutted profession profits.
---
Dude just tryin to be a dick
---
Thinks will rise again
---
Yeah like the other guy said the stamina is a big part. There's also better set bonuses for pvp and even though the gear technically comes out in phase 2, the weapons are basically bis until naxx.
---
"Likes to survive STV"
---
So let's say you use 1 to 5, q and e as your regular keys, which are 7 buttons lets not say that at all.
---
Why would you need more bindings than abilities? Macros in vanilla are slow af
---
Unequip your quiver. It's a known bug.
---
Well, for mage they’re required to go frost during early raiding because most mobs are immune to fire damage.  So fire legit isn’t an option for raiding until ZG / AQ time frame.
---
The other classes / specs you mentioned are just flat out bad when compared to other classes.  You CAN play them and have fun, but know that it comes with people turning their nose up at you (and rightfully so).  So you’ll have a harder time finding PvE groups than the good classes / specs.
---
&gt;just took me to some wierd mountain dew promo
---
So you're just trolling, np.
---
Do we have definite proof that this was how it worked in vanilla?
---
That's not how bindings work, everything omitted from the action bar remains the same weather you hold ctrl or alt.  I know exactly what you're saying, it just doesn't work.
---
 **&lt;Felidae&gt;**
---
Iron foe + Thrash Blade + Rogue talent that makes sword attacks have a 5% chance to double hit + windfury totem (20% chance to doublehit with extra dps) + high haste gear. Wonder what the dps this could reach would be, Warriors with Iron foe and thrash blade reach around 950 dps, feel like this variation could have more dps
---
Baller move my guy. Go build your empire of bronze.
---
Dwarf: Hunter, Priest, Paladin
---
Undead: Rogue, Mage
---
Orc: Shaman, Warrior, Warlock
---
Night Elf: Druid (for looks)
---
As others have said, it's down to personal preference. I use the following system;
---
Important spells I'll be spamming a lot = **shift+space / E / Q / shift+E / shift+Q**. These are keys my fingers rest on so can be hit with very little movement (great for reducing carpal tunnel syndrome).
---
Other spells can be grouped depending on how important they are with the best ones getting assigned to an unmodified key, secondary ones assigned to shift+keys and any left overs ones assigned to alt-keys or left unbound.
---
**C** and **R** are already bound but I prefer to change them to spells as they're too well placed on the keyboard to be taken up by trivial game functions.
---
9 out of 11
---
Others wouldn't be so subtle about it either, if they did it.
---
They don’t have the new realm list out yet
---
Yeah but like said above me, they are pretty damn easy, and they have nearly BiS gear/enchants/flasks/pots etc.
---
I have a feeling that classic will bring some players back. I played in classic and a lot of my memories from WoW have all been in classic. I have played every expansion since then however i always got bored rather quickly and that could just be that i am in a different life stage then i was when classic was around. In classic i made a lot of real life friends and some still play, some have passed and some quit shortly after TBC. I have talked with them and some are planning oncoming back!
---
Should be banned if its organized exploiting, griefing or harassment. I was playing when this did happen, there was hundreds players waiting or dying when they blocked most of the npcs.
---
You can raid as a PVP healer spec priest and you'd always be in demand.
---
Come on now it's a bit unusual but nothing to crazy, you got a tank à heal à hybrid and 2 dps.
---
I remember warlocks being feared (heh) in PvP, but I can't remember that before the later stages of vanilla.
---
Might just be my memory though, it's been a few years....
---
Private servers as well as videos / guides from the time of old Vanilla. As for Druids, they didn't have much time to shine, really, as they were shitty af for a big part of Vanilla. Well, we'll see, how it's gonna play out on Classic, as we are starting with 1.12 from the beginning.
---
And would you admit wotlk is a better game than vanilla?
---
Why isnt that our classic?
---
Man I can't wait til we can get our hands on ironfoe at test the true proc rate.
---
That fear won't break
---
If you level with a friend it's great. Solo it will take you more than twice the time of a mage or hunter.
---
How can you be so wrong, and not realize it...?
---
The raids are much easier than what it is in retail. But the thing is. End game raiding is about 90% of the game in BFA, while in vanilla end game raiding is just about 30% of the game. So for me, I don't mind having easier raids and maybe clear it fast, because the raids aren't everything.
---
They would have that if was holy too, that’s his entire point. Asmongold was redundant.
---
It’s only been a week?!?
---
I’ve heard that private servers changed some of the numbers in relation to tanking to make less desirable specs usable. I hope there is more than just warrior tank, cannot wait to get started
---
The gnome int scales with gear, atleast does so in beta, so gnomes are by far best casters
---
&lt;Shut Up and Color&gt;[NA][Horde][PvP]
---
We are a semi-hardcore raiding and PvP guild planning on weekend raiding, world PvP, battleground premades, and twinking (29 bracket). Our guild is primarily 30+ adults who have played various games together going back to vanilla and TBC. 
---
Raids: Saturday and Sunday 3pm to 7pm EST / 12pm to 4 pm PST (very likely we won't need this much time once we get some gear until AQ). Optional weeknight raids for 3 day reset content may also be planned. 
---
Loot: Loot Council consisting of 2 officers and 3 rotating positions filled by raiders. 20 man content and PvP items will be /roll. 
---
Expectations: We want to complete raid content efficiently to not waste people's time. We expect raiders to be on time with appropriate consumables in a PvE raiding spec. We would like to start raiding 1.5-2 months after launch. 
---
Recruiting: We are currently recruiting all classes/roles. We are looking for people interested in any or all of our guild activities, as well as more casual players just looking for some people to run dungeons and bgs with. 
---
If you are interested please contact us on discord.

You seem to have missed the point of this, you're not meant to double up on any race or class.
---
Might just get a WoW subscription again just to play Classic.
---
Powershifting is strong but he could've kept his group alive by using his Clearcasting procs to pop a max heal instead of 1 shred.
---
Soda chose a bit more DPS instead of healing snd helping and playing as a team and they wiped like 4 times even before the boss because of that and a number of other problems. The rogue and hunter weren't even specced correctly lol.
---
Warlock: gods of attrition warfare
---
Players: those who love to win
---
Pretty accurate lmao
---
Arcane shot skills with ranged attack power and not spell damage buddy
---
Sorry, I'm not sure I understand. I know that you need to have your buttons on the action bars. But realistically you'll only use buttons 1 to 5 and maybe some letter keys. So some modifiers are definitely very useful, personally I use shift a lot, might need to add alt for classic as well.
---
But foot pedals would be pretty dope imo, even if only to reduce the strain on my hand.
---
I love how people still bitch and complain about this
---
A post every 5 minutes is nice.
---
let the mainstream streamers have their 'fun', as pathetic as it is - the vets will swoop in and do what needs to be done... if they get an invite.
---
Are you trying to get into the mood for classic by making comments that belong in 2004?
---
The paladin blood runs true through your veins.
---
https://youtu.be/-k5K4a-teWo
---
With 1.12 talents and BWL+ gear warlocks are a force to be reckoned with. The only class who can compete in 1v1 world pvp are rogues and only if they get the drop on you and even then it's still a skill match. Every other class doesn't even come close to a skilled warlock player.
---
There is no real "PvP" gear as in giving resilience or PvP Power, instead you just have to choose your stats in different ways.
---
Some stats are worthless in PvP and some are worthless in PvE. You need a lot more hit and (I think) weaponskill for PvE, so you can sacrifice some of it for other stats in PvP, mainly more health. For casters it's the same situation with hit. There's also a stat called Spell Penetration which reduces the resistances of your target, but since bosses usually have 0 resistance after the warlock curses, the stat is pretty bad for PvE. It is very useful in PvP though because most players have some resistance.
---
If you have to manipulate it won’t work
---
Imagine unironically thinking you're a chad, but still shitposting on a world of warcraft forum.
---
Can we just ban plainly obvious jealously threads?
---
Crestfallen was my mages name back then haha. Great band!
---
But what do they do?
---
Pretty undead female, black mageweave set.
---
Oh my God - was this not on Dunemaul-EU?! I swear I remember this guild and Devlin, the player
---
I think female orcs and male undead look great in T0/T2 rogue sets.
---
in b4 you claim joana's guide with a few changes as your own with links to his youtube play through.
---
Because you can reserve your names 2 weeks before the launch, you need to know WHAT server you reserve them. Ppl have full guilds ready, you need to coordinate it.
---
Cool your saline jets, until further instruction from blizzard testing = playing, undirected. Not having played vanilla does not an invalid tested make, you're salty about not getting in and streamer privilege. You have a max of 3 months to wait
---
Of course maraudon farming was real, an easy 5 to 15g every 10 to 15 minutes
---
Yes I think so
---
The vanilla challenge! Play in 800x600, no addons, limit fps to 20 and increase ping to 300.
---
Privileged
---
Natur Enemy Cast Bar works well for that. It also shows you the duration of other player spell (for example how long until the enemy pally's Divine Shield wears off) and the cooldown on your diminishing returns. Very helpful.
---
Wow!!! I need to get myself some of these, that's amazing.
---
Kinda sad..
---
Anything in T2
---
I admit I'm am confused as well with which patch as it pertains to anything really as it was a constant change. I played since launch and to BC consistently so yeah Haha. Especially which patch it was when pvp was introduced, and battlegrounds. You could be right that it was on the tail end of vanilla, this is just what I remember.
---
alright i'll accept i probably overreacted, sorry.
---
Ping 300? Ez, spellbatching hehe
---
I know that at one point in Wrath, Prot was the go-to Arena spec. Heals that scaled off their max HP, good damage (not as bursty as Ret), survivability. It was nuts.
---
stay mad op
---
hey buddy, your jealousy is showing.
---
1-10 on classic beta is giving 60 linen provided you make sure to save any grinding to be done in areas that drop linen. you end up wanting to grind to levels a lot of times anyway before moving to the next area.
---
it's reasonable and like /u/ihasaccont says it's literally a few minutes out of your way for a nice wand if you do it right
---
ive been optimizing the wand crafting into my 1-10 'ahead of the pack' runs im trying to make. it's doable.
---
Those monitors are to track your 5 min buffs on your 40 man raid?
---
Woah that's nice
---
We all know you're gonna lose that fight and play alliance.
---
Rogues and warrior are easy to level, get good weapons consistently through the game, press two buttons, and never have to sit to drink, just bandage and onto the the next one.
---
Not in vanilla. It doesn't scale until TBC.
---
Yee. I WAS the swarf priest. Kaboom.
---
Hi, /u/danommm
---
flyin high my dude.
---
I remember when I originally saw this, it was the sole reason I rolled a Undead Mage. So good.
---
Bloodfang set (rogue T2)
---
Faith set (priest T3) but orc = get rekt
---
Nemesis set (warlock T2)
---
idk what you're on lol
---
&gt;I don't feel like add-ons should be promoted for a game we're trying to play old school style
---
Yeah, like we didnt have addons in vanilla.... \*sigh\*. Go look at UI shots from raids, the ugliest fucking things ever, barely could even see the ground.
---
You got it!
---
I'm not mad that I don't have a beta invite at all, just gonna make the actual release more exciting for me. But the it would be awesome to have a release that has actually been tested, instead of doing what they always do... make the ACTUAL release the official beta test where people actually report bugs and shit they think are not working as intended... that is all
---
I've described only some of the things I added in terms of content which again you conveniently don't address in your extremely low effort criticism. I've described the multiple thousands of hours of gameplay, game knowledge, video transcription, web development in 6 programming languages, visual design, layout and quest map images. Those are the elements that make it my guide. In the areas where it is not my guide the author is credited thoroughly in every instance. I imagine you give the reaction video streamers and youtubers a hell of a time for their reference to other peoples content as well. You must be extremely busy.

Depends on the server I guess. I've heard of Pservers also making some content harder. But yeah, try to look around. There is now kinda big community researching and theorycrafting Bear tanking. Start with youtube channel Skarm Tank, for example. There is much more though.
---
All Taurens share that feature yes.
---
I'm pretty prepared by now. I leveled 3 Warriors on Nost and Ely, one at Day1 of Serverlaunch which meant there were like 500 people in Northshire and you really had to get creative to even get to Level5. 
---
I also tested out all the WarlockQuests (until30) on the Beta and I'm pretty confident right now that I will be able to level somewhat quickly.
---
The only thing I'm a littel anxious about is picking the right Server and finding a decent Guild.
---
Is it a disadvantage or an advantage really?
---
Yeah it is a little frustrating from the point of view that the people with beta access get to enjoy world pvp, 5man dungeons, and essentially just all of the low level content. 
---
Then when classic releases they will all just speed run to 60 and most likely try to avoid all of this type of gameplay as much as possible. So they are really getting to take advantage of playing the game both ways.
---
kek
---
You can't join a guild, wait till 50 people joined and than pick a class.
---
Apply to a guild as the class you want to play.
---
I was one of the first who applied to a semi-hardcore guild so there were spots for what I wanted to play.
---
Clearly suffers from a lack of foot pedals. Honestly not sure how you're going to manage your keybindings.
---
I'm not sure tbh, someone else will have to comment on that. :)
---
Me 3
---
*a healthy amount of hatred for steamers
---
FTFY
---
Never played a mage, never needed water (coz i mean wtf rogues would need water for?) but so freakin spot on.
---
Nice editing skills too :)
---
Unfortunately, I am that which has no friends. Thanks for clarifying though! :)
---
Im in the same boat. My main anxiety right now is getting ahead of the initial blob of players, since my goal is to be one of the first to 60.
---
I appreciste the kind words and I'm glad you enjoyed!
---
Streamers got beta for marketing, that’s all. Cry to everyone else who got beta for finding bugs
---
for every one streamer in this beta im sure theres 10-20 people not streaming.
---
Thanks mate :)
---
I joined a guild 4isch months ago. I'll probebly go to the realm they are going.
---
It takes longer that's for sure. But it's still exaggerated that it's quit worthy levelling and that most people will quit.
---
As it is in classic beta right now it’s a huge disadvantage for Tauren hunters because it seems to allow people to be within your dead zone really far away.  I had a Tauren Hunter alt in real vanilla and really don’t remember this being a thing but apparently blizzard is doubling down on saying it’s correct so idk.
---
I remember my screen literally freezing for a second or two everytime I walked through the gates of orgrimmar
---
Perfection
---
You won't beat female human warrior in full R13 armor with the R14 2H axe...
---
Yeah, I think that might just be the PvP pservers... the PvE one I'm on has a pretty chill community.
---
PvE you need 8.4% hit chance for Bosses (lvl63) and are recommended more than that if dual wielding. And since hit chance is hard to come by the warriors pre-raid BiS list has a number of leather items.
---
For PvP you only need 5% hit (lvl 60 targets) and you don't want to wear any leather because survivability is king in PvP and you'll need the armor from wearing plate. So in PvP Stamina is the most useful stat.
---
I hope their plan is working better than their attempts to spin up multiple WSG instances.  The most that got going this weekend was 3 matches, 30-bracket only.
---
Hardly
---
isn't SM+DS a fairly standard warlock build?
---
theres already plenty of vets on the beta testing shit everyday
---
**&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server - Early Weeknight Raids! (Tu, W, Th 7p-10p EST)**
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are building a community of like minded, mature players to enjoy Classic WoW and now is the time to join us!
---
**Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:**
---
* Druid (Heal)
---
* Hunter
---
* Paladin (Heal)
---
* Priest (Heal)
---
* Warlock
---
**Raid Schedule – Early night EST Raids!**
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from **7pm to 10pm EST**. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn’t additional content available to clear. We plan to use a hybrid **transparent** form of Loot Council. This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
**Next Steps**
---
If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps. We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment. We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

Yes, I realize some years ago that reddit community of any given game really, represents a very small % of its player base. But since we "redditors" hang out around here all the time, tend to assume that the general reddit opinions and wishes represent the general consensus of the community. Some people don't even know what reddit is...
---
Also I don't get the WoW hate, I have hundreds of days played, maybe it reaches the thousands, I honestly feel bad bashing and hating on the game, close the end of Legion I run out of fucks to give about the direction the game now has, so I just quit and for the 1st time ever since it was released last August, I didn't bought the last WoW expansion. It was weird but I was not enjoying myself that much so I decided it was the best option...but I don't hate the game, in fact I love it and I wish I could still enjoy it daily, I am just "sad" the direction it took but I don't pretend to assume its a bad direction, maybe it was the best concerning the modern market and demographics? Its just not for me so I parted ways with it.
---
We will see how Classic goes, I just hope that the community will be healthy enough to have a solid raiding scene, my raiding on vanilla ended at C'thun sadly now I intended to clear it all, but I am also WAAAAAY more busy nowadays, so in order to do that I "require" a strong raiding scene, more specifically the existence of decent, capable and middle of pack guilds...and not a very fragmented raiding community, consisting on mostly 2 types of guilds, Hardcore Guids and Super Casual guilds.
---
We will see!
---
Kinda of ironic, that I am hoping for a larger and healthy enough community, in a sub reddit that the majority of the redditors believe that it WoW Classic will surpass retail by a large margin xD
---
Like I said, it wasn't that mainstream, I played without for the longest time, but rn it'll feel like it's mandatory idk? Just an opinion, of course people who used them at the time won't see the difference
---
Alliance has the babes
---
I would still need more keybindings.
---
Anything will work as long as it's a troll.

Dude less than 10000 neo nazis exist in north America as part of a group or acknowledged beliefs. Most of private servers are full of Chinese people and Russians. Stop fucking seeing nazis everywhere. Trump deported the last nazi we had in stock.
---
You left out the demographic that don't play wow, haven't played wow and will just be starting wow. It seems that the sub thinks the only two groups that will be playing are people that play retail and people that used to play retail.
---
WotF is very useful for PvE where fear meachic is used. Thanks to that you can use Ice Bloc as a debuff remover/life saver.
---
12 HOURS??? jfc dude, take a week off and do some pushups on your fps
---
If He was holy and 3 hunters they wouldve had nö chance. You need cleanse which Paladins dont have at 30 so you need The priest, esfand was specced as a Support doing some damage on the side but mostly allowing The Priest not to go OOM and be able to 5 second rule while Esfand is healing. Getting 2 people healing spec wouldve been Overkill so him Getting prot for Devo aura, kings and sancticty was real smart.
---
I've always wanted to see a video of someone buffed with WF and haste wearing all available "Chance on Hit: Extra Attack" items. If anyone knows such a video, please do share 🙏

Respec 4 times, isn't that like 36 gold? (That's hella moneyz)
---
Sure you might have managed this but this was still on private so I would take this with a grain of salt tbh.
---
So you can swing a wet noodle?
---
Of Course they will be deleted.
---
Wow I just realized we’re going back to main hand/ one hand/ off hand weapons
---
please, he's clearly pro-level here.... he'll have holy light bound to a bunch too.
---
I probably did 100 runs of BRD and UBRS helping guildies and saw _zero_ Sacred Charge and Ironfoe.
---
Of course it is not correct. The wow classic demographic is going to be made up of people who play wow, people who used to play wow and people who have never played wow. I don't think it should come as a shock when a significant percentile of the classic  playerbase are new to wow as a whole.
---
Hehe, i was being honest as this was how i remembered it.
---
My faults: Ambassador was in my mind connected to exalted, forgot it wasn't a title before Wrath.   
---
Started my new character just when BC came out, didn't consider that Rep gain from classic quests may had been changed from patch to patch.
---
Coffeine
---
What do you do in those 2.5 hours of sports?? I myself planned to do a 30 minute run and 30 minutes of other exercises. But that’s only 1 hour 😳
---
Most private servers tuned damage and health from bosses up, making them harder. I haven't heard about any way they were making tanking easier.
---
The biggest reason why druid tanks are a thing is the MCP from gnomer. I don't know if people figured it out back in actual vanilla, but it certainly wasn't well known if they did. Secondly, druids as tanks were absolutely garbage until much later patches, where their bear form stats got heavily padded, so the had a poor reputation that just never got fixed back in the day.
---
Yeah totally. This was more of the perspective that we have a core of players that we trust but are so trustworthy you can give them nearly any class and they can do well with it.
---
For sure - Fury warriors are disgusting
---
at least you get to see the login screen
---
Thanks, that's helpful.
---
ahahahah i love this

Gnome is the best for mage hands down.
---
What stream did you see him on (streamer/date)?  I would like to look at this.
---
thanks
---
You're barking up the wrong tree here. I have, in my entire life, met exactly ONE Nazi in real life. I don't think there's nazis everywhere. (funny how YOU are conflating neonazis and actual national socialists.) 
---
pservers, however, are riddled with the folks. anyone who's ever played a pserver before "the one that started it all" knows this. I think it has to do with the no barrier of entry, and terrible moderation. 
---
As I said, you're barking up the wrong tree. people spamming zone chat about "culture of critique" are neonazis, you're free to disagree but you'd be wrong.
---
I worry about this sub and some of you guys.
---
The game is 14 years old. Please dont throw away your girlfriends and social lives.... oh wait
---
Thanks for the time you put into this. I feel you immensely when putting all these "before sayin shit, keep reading" warnings, people can be real bitches out here. Glad they ended up changing this but DAMN if it took a long time. I'm on a crusade to get proper flight paths and hope they'll fix it in retail as well, and it's hard to convince people that their memory isn't perfect.
---
Gnome is best hands down.  The int buff is just so strong even on its own.
---
Lmfao wow, looking at this sober I think you managed to hurt drunk me's feelings.
---
This deserves all the medals
---
Very possible. harder to be an asshat on a smaller server.
---
I have the exact same pictures printed last week, also looking for a frame haha
---
if damage numbers per  hit keep matching vintage videos, the only thing left to look at is swing timers, which could effect similar nerfing.
---
Dude yeah they're all focusing on getting their BG stats up, what gives? no one's actually beta testing this, fuck that
---
A clicker!!!
---
The last line tho. That's not wow classic at all!
---
Which one do you have and do you like it?
---
have you seen how many clips people have of seeing bugs while watching a streamer? Wouldn't have those without them having invites. Not to mention tons of videos of what exactly happens, or to compare values from.       
---
But also most are invited for marketing as it's brought up literally everytime people complain about this
---
female orc warlock looks baller in T0, T1 AND T2
---
not so much in preraid BiS, but just con her into thinking she's going to wear dreadmist.
---
Hate losing = Don't want to die. Okay with disengaging if that means I won't die.
---
Love to win = Disengaging not okay. MUST kill to be satisfied. Not enough to simply not lose.
---
Not losing != Winning.
---
DM me all your warrior advice please and I promise to stay out of your way :)
---
It depends on the warrior type but in generell they will most likely be different. Pro Warrior will do for Stam, Def, maybe Agility. Hunters for Agility, Crit and Attack Power. DPS Warrior go for Strength, AP, Agility, Crit. So you see Agi is generally good, and AP or Crit also might share.
---
As far I can tell, I saw bluepost saying that decursive will not work
---
Been trying to remember the same. I believe pre 1.12 they were UP, then they got a few buffs and became super strong. There was a patch, if I recall, and it may have been 1.12 where some changes occurred (I forget which) and mages became a dominant class in pvp (in comparison to how they were and how warlocks were). Warlocks fell off, iirc for a while after that. I believe it might have been BC - was that when the inclusion of ice Lance occurred? I recall the tipping point being when frost mage was just super strong w/ice Lance and other stuff.
---
More then me anyway lul
---
Sorry to be a dumb millenial but you've got a 17 minute video with no sound and no commentary for at least the first 4 minutes and I expect the last 13 minutes too. It's pretty outrageous to expect someone to watch or take interest in the issue just off your clickbait title. You need to explain what's happening, show it, and then say what is expected to happen.
---
I was an adult with a college degree and a job in 2004.
---
Just because you were a child, don't assume everyone else was.
---
Just FYI.
---
no rogue streamers?
---
I dont know if this is what you are looking for but there is a documentary about the launch and the team behind World of Warcraft. Its called Looking for Group, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyPzTywUBsQ) is a link.
---
Sitting
---
Not bad, but would have upvoted if Azeroth map was on one of the MFDs and raid health bars on the EICAS.
---
It's not like the insanely long classic global cooldown requires keybinds to be efficient...
---
if you like old school slow paced RPG games with steady progression that take you on really immersive long journeys, then YES
---
Oh my God, all these bugs, 2 months to go?  God speed to whoever has to fix all this in time, for real.
---
My first thought was, I want to buy this! Looks amazing! Keep painting :)
---
Which service did you use?  
---
I used Geekify; they had an RPG map making service and worked with me to get the actual scale and render correct before printing it out on canvas.  It took a little bit (I think I ordered it in late April and it arrived this last Friday), but the detail and the quality of the canvas makes it so damned worth it.
---
This does work on beta. It's especially annoying when someone in your group doesn't realize how this works and they stand next to a mob you're trying to leash, as the mob will just de-aggro you and aggro them since they're in proximity.
---
You can’t avoid those zones if you want quests.
---
Mate I don't know how to tell you this but putting in different elements of work, does not entitle you to claim others information as your own guide and  then furthermore proceed to copyright it.
---
  To make matters worse the guide does not even work, as the majority of "your" guide on was done by someone else on a server with incorrect quest hand in values.  Your hack shift edits to make it appear like it will work does it no favors to any one with a keen eye.
---
Guide does not work, sage cant even prove that  it has ever worked. use it if you want your choice.  
---
  6 programming languages BTW.
---
You are most likely going to buy the game regardless of how many minor bugs it has on release.
---
It's not only longer but very boring. Auto attack and bandages.
---
Yeah. It works in vanilla, but your damage output is much lower and reliant on cooldowns. That's why you heal most of the time.
---
That is totally awesome!
---
Half of these are synonyms of each other
---
Yep, I mixed up the names. It was Sanctuary, the 21pt Prot talent.
---
It's a disadvantage for tauren hunters. Bigger hit box = also bigger deadzone. In dungeons I have to stand further back than the other races if I want to be able to shoot the same target for example.
---
I think this only works in dungeons and not in open world. In open world if you pull you hold aggro untill you walk to far away from there spawnpoint without hitting/get hit. Once out of range the mob will walk back to his spawn location evading all attackts untill 'resetted' by reaching hos spawnpoint.
---
Of course r13 does not, since it's enh gear. 
---
I would like to see this kind of setup when you get 350 nature dmg once Dire Maul is out.
---
sorry no time for that. I'm at work
---
Nah, his extra healing (and buffs and CDs) was clearly necessary on that last boss.
---
If they refund me every penny I've spent on WoW I'm good to go
---
Misdirection is a TBC skill
---
Especially when we still have legion mechanics such as [Retail Leeway Mechanics](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7ks2/melee_leeway_retail_mechanic_in_classic/) on beta. No changes blizz please fix. &lt;3 
---
[Legion Retail Melee Leeway Mechanics on Beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7ks2/melee_leeway_retail_mechanic_in_classic/)
---
I mean, it should increase your max range aswell
---
altho it is a joke it is quite true, the amount of jew/n-word hate speech you see on pserver general chats is disturbing
---
For bad hunters this may be the case. Good hunters can keep their pets alive
---
I'm saying ASMONGOLD was redundant, not the priest.
---
Happened to me in Ironforge and I would always end up in the pit in front of the auction house after my computer caught up. Then I’d have to run around and try again and hope the lag didn’t put me in there again.
---
Lol hope she likes her avatars to be THICC cause that's what you get when you play horde...or skinny methed up undead chick, great options really. GOODLUCK!
---
Yeah after the tears had dried
---
Did we forget that vanilla is actually full of bugs that never got resolved? Not sure I understand your complaint here. Drop rates are as shit as ever, mobs hit pretty hard and get magical crits on the last swing, and quest givers are working. Working as intended I believe is the phrase...
---

---
Hating streamers but proceeds to talk like a retard from twitch.
---
we are forming a guild already.  
---
it's almost sure we are going for a low pop PVP Server.  
---
but not sure how we decide if something is a low pop server on release date....
---
not all servers have edgelords spewing nazi stuff but it is very common, ive played on 5 different classic pservers and 4 of them had this problem
---
Oh i see. Sad
---
There's a rather small amount of bugs for such an old game. I expected way worse.
---
Interested in a EU guild for PVE that's looking to raid 2/3 days a week. My only thing is I don't want to rush to 60, so which is why I'm not looking for some hard-core high end raiding guild.
---
Currently looking to either play a Warrior as a tank 1st, fury 2nd or a mage. I will most likely come with a priest friend.
---
&gt; Just because you were a child, don't assume everyone else was.
---
Try and stay civil, I know it's hard for you to do, but at least try. :)
---
Uhm.. Please watch the Video, we didnt preclear Trash. So you're spreading false rumours. This also was when only MC and BWL was out. So it gets much faster after AQ release.
---
Full buffs can be aquired in 1 hour max. So everyone that doesnt have spare time should get it
---
"Hunter: Pulling"

Am I a joke to you?

You dont need 2,5 hours a day to train unarmed weapon skills. You dont need it at all.

That's really interesting! Thanks!

**&lt;Reforged&gt;** Alliance **|** NA-PvP **|** Hardcore
---
:scroll: **INTRODUCTION**
---
Reforged is a guild built specifically for WoW Classic, consisting of very experienced and passionate World of Warcraft raiders, dating back to the beginning.  We are a PVE focused progression guild.  We have a very strong foundation built.  As recruitment continues, we will ensure new recruits fit in well with our group and with our goals.  At this point, the recruitment process is quite intensive.  Put in effort to learn as much about your class, BiS, and/or any plans for leveling, etc.  It will be apparent who puts in the effort and who doesn’t.  As our mission statement states, we want our guild to be lean. We will not have a huge roster. So, make yourself competitive!
---
:trophy: **GOALS**
---
We strongly believe in quality over quantity. Our aim is to keep our guild lean, tight-knit, and most of all, a fun and desirable place to call home. Efficiently completing all raid content that World of Warcraft Classic has to offer is our main goal. We will build and maintain a strong and consistent raid team that is capable of farming content while maintaining a fun and enjoyable raid atmosphere. When not raiding, expect us to be pushing high-tier PvP ranks through coordinated team battlegrounds and world PvP.

Put on your spirit staff and wand. 
---
but as a mage, you should be good. mostly if you plan your 4 manastones and evocation all at the right times you wont run out of mana.
---
I wish I could have taken time off for release, but I'm also going on holiday for two weeks a week after release :( Don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly excited for my holiday but I don't want my buddies to get too far ahead!
---
It might also be a disadvantage since u need to stay way back to kill a mob
---
You can avoid some of them, but the main takeaway is not to follow the path blindly.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Wouldnt recommend. Raids do take many rogues, but there are more rogues than spots. Competition is really high for dungeon loot/spots and nobody will take  people who have no dungeon gear to raids.
---
I think it will have the same effect that a game like dark souls gave me the first time I played it.
---
It was difficult, and you played by the games rules. I quit after a few hours but something drew me back to it. Now I’ve played for hundreds of hours in each entry.
---
I feel like Wow Classic will have a similar effect and it will be a breathe of fresh air for people who have never experienced that kind of challenge
---
I like a lot of the instances in TBC. the layouts of the dungeons, mobs and fights were an interesting change from vanilla. I loved leveling in outlands too. Zangamarsh was cool
---
wow supports differentiation between left side modifers and right side modifiers, so you can make the footpedals all right side shift/altgr/ctrl
---
The hype will die fast though. 
---
Its too slow to stream
---
People overestimate how fun itll be once the grind gets hard
---
Most people here have grown up ans have families and jobs and cant play for hours a day.
---
Itll be fun for a few months to screw around but i think itll be a disappoitment for many when they realize wotlk was the peak of wow

---
They're comparing it to every other game which is the more relevant comparison as the vast majority of people have never played a pre-WoW. If older mmos are like jobs than WoW is a part time position, which is still a giant time investment for one game. Anyone spending as much as 30 hours a week on one activity is not a casual. If you played Tennis 30 hours every week no one would call you "casual", they would call you pretty hardcore in your commitment to it as an activity. If you find yourself on a forum discussing a game, spending 3-4+ hours a day playing that game while doing research about the game outside of actually playing you are by no definition a casual. Casuals play a few times a week for a couple of hours at inconsistent intervals, not everyday for 4 hours consistently.
---
So shaman appears to be the most popular class, heh? Who would've known.

---
I just want classic. August is way too late. Dunno what to do while I wait :(
---
As I'm scrolling through this, I start wondering about CrapAway. Asking the real questions here.
---
I never cared for RP but I wanted to try it out for a long time. I signed it. I hope you guys get that server! Good luck!
---
Oh my bad, I looked at the start and saw the cleared trash to core hounds and assumed it was cleared to garr too, thought that both were cleared normally.           
---
Buffs true, but that'll heavily depend on the server since ony head has a CD, and people potentially fucking over others.
---
oh man, i love this song!  It was epic back then (played R13 Mage ..Arcane/fire xD and still have as big smile on my face listening and remembering good ol'times ;) )
---
But dont't forget  [this gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzo6NJBKco)
---
what advice do you have for hitting level 5 quickly on a fresh server? I've heard grinding and pushing through the early quests, group grinding lvl 5-7s, or exploring experience. I'm not really sure which one is best but the exploring route seems decent from what I saw, but may change significantly because mob pathing is different on classic and even 1 death can set you back drastically.
---
Where can i find this picture in high res?
---
I watched Joana, one of the best speed levelers, die multiple times the past few days testing his leveling guide's routes, both on hunter and warlock. It's not that easy.
---
Webdesigner?
---
That’s what I experienced aswell.
---
[https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/) already exists. Perhaps you can get some design tips or updates from there? But imo it will be better to just have the website for it other than a new section in your site, sorry.
---
You should be posting in /r/stocks my man :D
---
Was Priest from Vanilla to Cata before I quit.
---
Its true. I get my jollies from enabling others to go apeshit. Heck I met my spouse by hiding in a bush and healing him as he rekt 3 Alliance scrubs who seemed to think just hitting him more would solve their problem.
---
This is what I am asking, I'd like a solid confirmation as to what client this new classic client is based on.
---
Kind of a pain to farm, as they are a low drop from rare 50ish+ lvl mobs/chest, but the Ornate Mail greens look awesome! The chest and belt even changes to be more "ooh la la" on female characters vs male characters haha.
---
747/747
---
Or at all. It's currently broken. ;)
---
No reason to be concerned.
---
I think they are very Aware of the work ahead of them and take no risks with announcing something too early.
---
It is their Job pretty much so just hang in there and watch the miracle unfold
---
The only titles in classic were pvp ranks
---
The guide clearly states that it is about healadins.
---
Back in the day... you would see rogues doing this to each other while farming Tyr’s Hand. Same faction, but if you’re stealing their mobs they will train all the elites to your face and then click Vanish.
---
They wont make new content. Itll be BC or nothing
---
the private server people are mostly people who played vanilla and tbc and like yourself stopped around wotlk. some came back on and off and other started looking for private server to play vanilla and tbc again.
---
Also the whole private server is not that large. around 100-200k players. i would say classic will ready much higher numbers even after the 1st 2 months pass by and the population settles down. i would say the population will stabilize at 1 million after a crazy 1st month launch with crazy numbers (3-5 million). so the people who played on private servers would make up 20% of the players.
---
that is my personal thought/prediction.
---
Where is the original?
---
500k isnt enough for them to do it. It cost them a ton to make raidd
---
I never said it wasn't strong, but it's probably not stronger than Hunters who are incapable of glancing blows.
---
Hahaha his comment history is hilarious
---
Did they add that during Vanilla? I kited Kazzak to SW with a friend during Vanilla when almost all GM's in Europe weren't working because of the May Day.
---
# [A] Seven Sins Late Night Guild EU
---
Started by a bunch of irl friends (**and already at 50 members**) with top tier experience through all expansions. (**including world 8th kill TOTC**), Seven Sins is here for all the nostalgic nerds out there that wanna play Classic and cannot do so the normal raiding hours.
---
***General info***
---
* We want to make a **semi-hardcore PVE** guild that will raid 2 times per week(3 on progress) and rest nights run dungeons,world PVP and all the good classic stuff.
---
* If you dont wanna go hard on launch and just wanna chill out but night is your time of the day you can play you can still join the guild as a social and play with more people at night!
---
Raiding info
---
* We aim to clear all content available at the highest pace as we can for a late night guild.
---
* We wanna give everyone a fair chance so if you wanna be Role officers or Raid leader the challenge is here and we will make you feel at home.
---
* We have application forms already and a roster doc .
---
* We plan to raid around 23.30 (Server time) probably Wed/Thu(+Sunday on progress). Exact hour and days will be discussed later on.
---
* We will use Loot Council.
---
* Raiders should have 100% attendance especially when we raid 2 days only and be ready with consumables, enchanted gear.
---
* We will be a fun late night community but on raid times we expect everyone to be serious and focused so we are done with raids in 2 days max and have some world fun the rest of the days.
---
* People should be able to take criticism and have full knowledge of their class.
---
So if you looking for late night raiding,late night pvp or just to chat with someone late night Seven Sins is the guild you looking for.
---
For more info add me on Discord **KingMavros#2601**

Growing up doesn't mean not having feelings. The only people who act edgy and pretend to be above the fucking human condition are edgy teenagers and insufferable pricks.
---
This is my main concern.
---
I want a pvp server where both factions will be prevelant, not line in retail where servers are 90% Horde or Alliance.
---
I dont want to reroll countless times and progress again and again to find the correct server.
---
92 hours should get you into your 50's if you do nothing but grind. Should be 60 around \~110-120 hours /played.
---
Showering, changing, eating.
---
500k?
---
Melee BiS is so hard to fucking get. I’ve seen HoJ and Ironfoe so many times but never won either.
---
There’s only honoured discount in classic - nothing for revered.  The only mount discounts you can get are honoured and rank3 pvp.  But pvp won’t be in at launch.
---
Haste gear?
---
It is painful if you level it the traditional way, ie you go through a zone and eventually hit its yellow quests, which for a Warrior can take longer and be far more dangerous.
---
It is very easy if you know which zones align well together, so you mostly do quests that are a level or two lower, this makes the Warrior breeze through them. For example, instead of just doing Barrens or just doing Silverpine, do both at the same time, ie: get 2 levels in Silverpine, then get 2 levels in Barrens etc. This will ensure that you will not struggle in either, and when you pull extra, you should be fine.
---
Add windfury
---
1. By "content you can't lose" you mean warfronts?
---
2. By "slot machine" do you mean RNG which was also the norm in classic
---
3. With difficulties ,the progression is acquiring the skill and gear needed to run the next level. Only people who have never run a mythic dungeon / raid think it's the same as lower difficulties
---
This is a really good point that some people don't consider, while a good portion of others do. The people who (I think) are most likely to criticize this post as being superfluous would probably also fall into the same circle of "yeah I already thought of it" on a Venn diagram.
---
Then there's folks like me, who haven't been back in a very very long time. I would have forgotten entirely about the difference between PVE and PVP. If for nothing else, thank you for that reminder.
---
It’s not bannable on a pvp server if there is legit pvp recourse to stop it.  What is bannable is exploiting things like guard safe spots in neutral towns etc.
---
Its literally all over the internet because of anonymity.
---
Yeah thats included in this time, that would be just too much detail ^^
---
From what I’ve been reading, reckoning DOES work with /sit crits. Dunno whose right without testing.
---
condescending and wrong, a nice combo
---
well I tend to avoid direct conflict so hey
---
Their fans in the no beta club are in these comments for sure.  I am not sure how their content helps Blizz test the game.  Maybe hype, if something that 12 million people subscribed to needs hype.
---
I think the stress tests are a good in between for getting a taste for it without the commitment/investment.
---
... aaaand now I’m reading the Kingkiller Chronicle yet again
---
&gt;  because it requires strict timing or else you lose lots of DPS
---
can you explain this a little bit to me please ? step by step
---
Not many people care about asmongolds reactions, and those who care will see it in there youtube feeds anyway.

If you would link the original video I could understand it.

what are the other 284 auction house rules of trading?
---
Haha haste gear!
---
No bans just flame them to the point of not posting such garbage again
---
Well in Ely I did the exploring route because you literally could not kill a single Wolf early on in Northshire. Even outside of Northshire the Wolves were camped. But Exploring is only worth it if you can't find a spot to grind somewhat efficiently.
---
But in Classic it should not be as bad, you just need to get ahead of the pack. Don't bother with overfarmed spots like the Mine near Goldshire etc.
---
no the standard is SM+ruin or DS and ruin
---
I could be mistaken, but Battlegrounds are running on separate servers. They could have added only a very small one to test how the tech would cope under stress.
---
Nah it was like over a year after launch no? Like 2006
---
Mages being described as fearless made me laugh. Too many times I seen them just ice block then blink away when in danger
---
My prediction is the blizz fanbase will treat it like an expansion, BFA guilds will die, the launch will be a repeat of history where devs don’t expect the numbers they get and they have to open new servers despite having layers.
---
Well going with your estimate of 500k, that’s 90 million in annual revenue. You don’t think that’s enough to support further development? There’s people making world class games on 250k
---
I don't need a bind for mounting.
---
You have all the time in the world to plan your epic journey to 60 :)
---
Plus the top groups are all BiS and communicating well together.
---
They were a rarely played class at the beginning of vanilla. I'm not sure exactly why, but they did get buffed.
---
idk how common this was, but people having an extra account that would whisper others in twink bg's for 1v1s cross realm, those were dope
---
Lemme dig through my email and I'll post it in a comment, there's been a few people who've asked for it!
---
Windfury shaman anyone?
---
Thank's for your insight, from a dev point of view that makes sense. I'd really like a video/doc/website showing what they are actually doing. Though that may be impossible at this time as it is probably internal to the company, guessing they may comment on this subject closer to release or after release.
---
I played warrior and hunter back in vanilla and only ever had a laptop until MOP. The left, down, and right keys were always perfectly placed for stance dancing and traps.
---
Yourself?
---
All good :-)
---
To be clear the dps on the gun on affects shooting, so the part you care about on warrior is the other added stats.
---
It got added progressively as people kept kiting different world bosses to cities lol
---
Staysafe (WoW Classic Streamer) was in que for a BG for about 5 and a half hours.
---
Whos saying its mandatory ? Everyone plays the way they want.
---
Everyone I don't like is Hitler.
---
Way ahead of you.
---
Dude, you are not making sense.
---
Your deadzone is not bigger but it is further away from your character which kinda is a disadvantage
---
Ya, April 2006. That's when 1.4 dropped.
---
It\`s just for one week, I will be back to my normal life afterwards... At least I hope so
---
wot
---
If its 20% it will be the hands down most broken weapon in the game lol
---
On privates there is a debate and the proc rates range from 4/6% sometimes 10 on more funserver-ish servers.. and even then the weapon is BiS into naxx with certain gear setups.
---
20% would be literally insane lol here is a meme from the warrior theorycrafting community, take note that its an exaggerated joke of a post

I'd rather have them in beta then someone like your self, because it is clear you don't have the basic brainpower to work out why they are invited. If you can't work that out and are here posting this dribble then sure as shit you won't do a better job testing.
---
How much did it cost?
---
You sound butt hurt as fuck. If I had to guess I would say you got banned from a private server and cant deal with that.
---
No. People who spam about "culture of critique" and how jews are subverting western society, are _neo_ Nazis.
---
From the beta it looks like there is a guy in major cities you can talk to to queue up
---
If your in a group, the leader just has to do it
---
Earlier in vanilla you had to go to the entrance of the BG to queue up
---
Sounds like you're making it boring. There's hamstring kiting to increase your survivability and lower downtime, sweeping strikes at 30 to melt two mobs at a time every cooldown, swapping stances to pummel or maximize dps, dying in wpvp etc.
---
Really I think it's as engaging as you want to make it.

Kind of

There's a guy in the major cities you talk to for each BG
---
Who puts you in queue for that BG only
---
I mean.. it's confirmed to be what it was eventually. Not 1.0 at launch.
---
Ironfoe is a wet noodle? Fury tanks use it into Naxx lol
---
FEELIN' LIKE A GUTTERSNIPE STANDING IN LINE
---
DECIDING HIS LIFESTYLE BY ROLLING THE DICE
---
yup lol. if its truly 20% it will become joke-level status.. as 4-6% alone makes it on par or better with all other weapons in the game. Like we are talking depending on your race is it on par with early Naxx weapons and loses to the KT sword by a fraction of a percent on spreadsheet parsing.
---
If its 20% I will lose my mind lol
---
Oh please. He is just a regular joe.
---
Nazis barely exist anymore, stop giving them exposure.
---
I’ve been reading the guide all weekend and it’s funny how much things changed just between launch and when the book was written. The book talks about losing XP when you res at a spirit healer and calls the PvP realm the “faction vs faction” servers. Also shaman are “formidable tanks.”
---
They were mushrooms at first, but along with endless memetic nerfs to fear there was a trickling number of buffs to the warlock in pvp during the entirety of vanilla. To the untrained eye though, when the warlock got a fear effect on Death Coil and a semi-permanent Soul Link in 1.8, one year after release, they started to appear on the PVP whine map, and quite frankly never left since.
---
But yeah for roughly a year give or take a patch they were absolutely terrible.

Looks great! Now all you need is an actual mouse
---
cause people will get bored out of their mind after their 5th MC clear... which for the ones interested in raiding, will be somewhere around the 6th or 7th week.
---
Once people start only logging in on reset day to clear the raid, population start to dwindle.
---
Absolute rubbish, a lot of players who took wow seriously hadn't played any mmo's before this. WoW made mmo's accessible and bought in die hard players from other game genres.
---
&gt; Pservers have such absurd droprates and absurd everything else that taking ANY of their data at face value is quite stupid.
---
So you are just ignoring the part where I presented evidence that is not from a pserver?

The more mainstream it gets, the more people without them will feel like they're missing out and NEED to get them, instead of getting them because they want, you see what I mean?

Maybe model a sliding target mob level of +3? or so (fixes a lot of the miss issues +4 and higher have) once at level 2, as realistically 5 level 4's would run out of level 5 mobs in any contiguous area pretty fast.
---
Everything.
---
Keep in mind LH is a private server.
---
Warlock pets will do full damage but leveling with void walker the damage is crap anyway.
---
Is it bad that I read procrates with the same sort of phonetics as "Socrates"
---
I might be wrong but I don’t believe it does.
---
Just two more days till stress test 2.
---
I'm OK, I was never banned from any Pservers.
---
You shouldn't assume things because you're not sure how to "win" a debate. It's incredibly pathetic. I expect better from the Dutch. Be better, our ancestors conquered half the globe. 
---
I was simply saying that I disliked that part of private servers, no need to get so defensive about your favorite pserver with trash coding and corrupt admins.
---
That's very cockpit
---
https://ibb.co/bQQ4dzB - Imgur didn't like having such a high resolution file and kept converting it to JPG, so had to use imgBB instead. This should preserve the file size and pixel quality though!
---
https://ibb.co/bQQ4dzB &lt;-- right here!
---
for half of vanilla, macros were so powerful they had to be nerfed.  you could setup if else statements to respond conditional things.  like cast overpower if enemy dodged attack.  along with rest of rotation.
---
Iron foe + windfury... why am I rolling Alliance for Classic? 😭
---
&gt; So you are just ignoring the part where I presented evidence that is not from a pserver?
---
"evidence", AKA a single comment on wowhead.

15 years in playing games makes a difference in skill, IDK about you guys but I am a hell of a lot better of a player than when I was 10.
---
I recognize that Skyrim font.
---
Avoiding direct conflict, yep.
---
Fully supported, doesn't crop at all.
---
I played with my 32:9 on the stresstest and it was neat. Only problem is that you can't move certain frames without addons, so need to get a working version of "MoveAnything" addon for example
---
&gt; With having a Mage to make drinks for both of you 
---
He's a Warlock, he doesn't need no god damn magic fairy water! :P
---
To be fair I think this is a pretty poor effort, it's like when you have to put something in the box so you just "put something", amusing all the same.
---
For canvas, 'ragged edges', and the custom size, it was 111.94 shipped.
---
Ironfoe is reserved for enhancement shamans. With windfury its 4 attacks lol
---
Not my fault you're terrible at English.
---
Shaman: All Types
---
Accurate. Vanilla horde had *so. many. shamans.*
---
Not as common as SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin but yes
---
Roughly my plan but only hoing with the one sleep chunk, making it an hour longer though and keeping the workout to 30 min a day &amp; during flight paths and waiting for people to arrive to dungeone
---
Yea I encountered the shaman tank part too. They talk about using shocks and heals to establish aggro.
---
There's nothing about it being turned on and off. I don't think there's anything rly different about it except small things. Like sharding being between different servers when layering is the same server. Like sharding is like going I different identical houses with people Al iver the block where as layering is different identical floors in the same building. There isn't an option to turn it off though, they just say theyrr getting rid of it after like a month after launch
---
I've seen Questie being used on beta streams at least. Not sure about pfQuest (which I prefer)
---
Uh? so I wasn't the only person then.
---
If I was one of the most famous vanilla rogues of all time that would be pretty cool.
---
This thread is pretty dead. You totally just went sifting through the classic sub to spread some of your wonderful cheery vibe more didn’t you?
---
Do you have pvp videos from when you where 60 in vanilla?

Well, I that would take some intense macros tbh. But cool idea.  Are the huge chain macros back? I know blizz at some point disallowed 1 button play macros, so if you wanted to, for instance equip sword + board, swap stance, use sheild slam

You would need 2 presses of the button.

You're completely correct, so hunters are only useful for tranq then ^^

Unfortunately classic won’t be fun for you because you can’t unlearn your knowledge of the game. /s

Sure but Asmon brought Esfand for buffs and offhealing. Soda should have been there for some DPS and offheals but he tunnelvisoned damage and the priest would just OOM and they all wiped.

Why, don't Beta players do BGs for fun/testing? Already burnt out..?
---
You are a lock so there is no harm in going over there right away.
---
But don't you like buffing yourself every 5 mins while going afk when you set your toon to autoattack for 20 seconds?
---
Way more fun than kiting and throwing out spells as mage
---
Watching some of the beta live streams made me realize that even the top tier players utilize the run of the mill guides. 
---
And i totally agree, we have an opportunity to experience pure nostalgia, and I hope people just let each other enjoy themselves.
---
Because it somehow matters how do the streamers progress...
---
&gt; not everyone has their computers bought for them by parents, just fyi.
---
You consider this, your post, civil?  Hardly.  It was snooty.  And you know it.  Trying to take the high ground after that is pathetic.

"rant about nazis"

---

No reason to report me, because, unlike you, I remained civil this entire time.
---
Well its not even his videos people watch. Its cheap youtube accounts trying to leech of streamers fame. Its a win for asmongold without doing any work but there are so many of these "streamer X watches X video" youtube accounts its just annoying.
---
OP linked ot a video with 40isch vieuws, would not even be supriced if it was his own channel.
---
Damn.... let's hope that they put in the effort!
---
Otherwise... It could be quite fun to have the first couple of month's without a working quest addon :D I´m going to Play Alliance for the first so it could be quite bad ;)
---
Are you working on addons yourself?
---
He didn't want to stack hunters since there's going to be a race later with no class stacking.

12.5 hours of sports, it's more than I do a year... Are you sure it's necessary? IMO it's healthier to sleep a bit more.

**[EU - Alliance]**
---
**IRL**
---
Hello! Im Morten from Denmark, 33 years old.
---
**Ingame**
---
Planning on playing a Human Prot Warrior
---
**Experience**
---
Im known as Mazie, my journey in started on a Nelf Priest, which cleared MC. 
---
Then I went to a newly started realm Khadgar, where I played mage in the guild that got every server first from MC to Naxx apart from 1 ZG boss. 
---
Meanwhile playing my mage I discovered my one true love, my gnome warrior alt, so when TBC hit, I rerolled Prot Warrior and became the main tank in a new guild. This guild proceeded to take every first boss in TBC that was released untill I left the server for a more competitive one. I went to Silvermoon where I joined Silence (during SSC progress), and was with them untill Illidan. Time restraints made me decide to go a bit more casual and play DPS warrior untill the end of TBC.
---
After TBC I've played a bit on/off, and currently playing a bit of BFA, but not much.
---
**Ambitions**
---
My ambition for Classic is going to be raiding. Wether it ends up being Casual or Semi-hardcore depends on the guild I end up in. I wish I could go full on hardcore like back in the day, but with a job, GF and house, thats not likely to happen.
---
I hope to become the main tank in a Casual/Semi-hardcore guild, since the role of maintank in TBC was the one I fit best in during my time of playing the game.
---
And I've got the week of the release off work, so hopefully I can get a good start :)
---
**Guild**
---
Like I pointed out, I'm looking for a casual or semi-hardcore raiding guild, so probably 2-3 raiding days. I am looking for a mature guild who just wants to enjoy the game and progress efficiently, so not alot of drama.
---
I did some alt-raid organizing and leading in Vanilla and was an on/off officer/raidlead in some later expansions for casual guilds, so also willing to put in some work with organizing the guild.
---
Just add the game to steam and remap an Xbox controller.
---
So many spastics in one thread wtf

That’s clearly an Airbus cockpit bro. Get it together!
---
Looks like 1 faction is atleast.
---
Listing an exaggerate amount can discourage many others from entering the market, as it can - at first glance - look like a big whale has taken over and they might be scared off to try and compete in said market.
---
Alliance has better races she probably find appealing. You'd have better luck if Horde had Blood Elfs.
---
This comes at the cost of leveling first aid which should be taken into consideration.
---
Still not very civil, must be hard for you.

Why does it only say Azeroth on the bottom right? Azeroth should be everything, no?

&lt;Zz&gt; Hardcore Raiding Guild
---
North American Horde
---
West Coast / PVP Realm
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Zz&gt; is comprised of a core of 15 veteran World of Warcraft players, our leadership has cleared through Naxxramas on Private servers and has raided in top retail guilds such as &lt;Gentleman's Club&gt; and &lt;Midwinter&gt;. We are eager to find players that want to bring a hardcore mindset to Classic.
---
**Goals on launch:** Our first goal will be to achieve a **World Top 5 Ragnaros** and as such we are looking for people interested in leveling quickly and diving straight into the end-game content. We are confident that we can kill Ragnaros by day 9 if not faster.
---
**Goals beyond launch:**" Once we have killed Ragnaros we are going to be forming a second raid and doing split runs and once Phase 2 is released we will be pushing to have as many players reach Rank 14 as possible.
---
**Raid Times:** Scheduled raid times are Tuesday and Wednesday 6pm-10pm PST, Early on you can expect the weekly raid commitment to be only about 2 hours per week since it will just be Molten Core and Onyxia. Your schedule should be flexible and agreeable with raiding Sunday and Monday as extra raid days for new content releases and split raids.
---
**Requirements:** Raiders will be expected to show up to raids fully consumed and with an attitude that lends itself to working in a team environment. We're looking for players with competitive mindsets who will push each other to improve and overall better the guild. Members will also be required to have a level 20 Warlock/summoning alt for world bosses. 
---
**How to Apply:** It's as easy as sending in an application! &lt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf48RsCpN17p0th0ZVUcx6V8QDDcbpnRgCpEBgFeQJTy5z_uw/viewform?usp=sf_link&gt;
---
Feel free to  DM me with any questions. We are always looking for exceptional and passionate players.
---
Appreciate you for noticing me senpai.
---
there are none online remember
---
Oh man, this reminds me of Milo's "there's no racism" comment. Just because people arent yelling "gas the Jews" openly in the street doesnt mean shit. Shit like the civil rights act doesnt stop people from being racist, they just have to be more sly about it.
---
Bongos &gt; Bartender 1.12 due to the bugs. Hopefully the situation will improve in classic.
---
Can’t throw away what I don’t have
---
Thats the most hyperbolic use of math ive ever seen.
---
Lets say theres 2 million eligible beta testers on retail rn, people that are subbed. 100 which is the amount of streamers at most represents 0.005% of that population. Good luck getting beta with those odds. 
---
It ultimately comes down to that really, you rolling for one of the 100 spots against 2 million people, what are the chances that you're amongst the 0.005%
---
**You** are going to be ugly and smelly something. Not sure if you can really convince her to e-mate with it.
---
If you look at the original map that was drawn by Metzen, the Stormwind'ish area was dubbed 'Azeroth'. Granted, Kalimdor was *way* smaller, too.
---
There are more reliable means than combat log at least in 1.12. There is an addon that plays very loud war drums based on the 1.12 API without even having to poll.
---
Wasn’t looking for a sarcastic response. Just saying it would be fun to enjoy fresh content and do all the little things, then when full release comes, lvl to 60 ASAP
---
You will just be told that "it is beta", even though this excuse never ever works, because no game is drastically different from its beta. See: every game ever released.
---
I think what has happened to r/classicwow is that the sub is so deeply invested in the hypetrain, that nothing can stop it at this moment. If Blizzard announced LFR tomorrow, it would be accepted: "*Stop whining, if you dont like LFR just dont use it SHEESH! Anyway upvote my drawing of a Orc's ass!*". This tends to happen on subreddits concerning anything, hype just takes over and you are pissing the wind trying to even bring it up.
---
My concern with the bugs is that they will be exploited and it will fuck the economy of the game long term, long after the hype has died down and people begin to realize that they should have been more critical.
---

Was this also a vanilla 1.12 thing?
---
Will it stay in classic that way or do we have to go to the entrance ?
---
Reward requires one to make such risks. I think you learned a life lesson as well.
---
Great response thank you!
---
I can deal with some "edgy" spam, but these people were quite literally recruiting people into their shitty ideology.
---
It was every zone, as soon as the Americans woke up.
---
Children spamming "bad words" is not nearly as nasty as Stormfront-esque recruitment.
---
Sorry I meant to say Berserker the WSG damage buff, not Berserking.
---
Going to the entrance was not required in 1.12
---
Why do you delete your comments when you get downvoted LMAO
---
I saved the image and printed it myself on a specific printer designed for printing blueprints… So cost me nothing, except what the frame will cost!
---
With Vanilla I could 1 hit almost any class from behind as a rogue.
---
Also ask someone to randomly turn your router off at least few times a day - few times an hour when in a dungeon group.

**\[EU-PvE\] &lt;Truefaith&gt; \[Alliance\] Filthy Casuals Warning!** 
---
**About Us:** \- We are reincarnation of vanilla WoW casual guild. Friendly and laid back, yet raiding capable group of nerds. Guild got to like half-way AQ40, which if you ask me is quite impressive for casuals, and that’s on Qual Thalas which was a realm added later, not at launch
---
We don’t focus on PvP tho certain individuals with questionable sanity and paladin toolkit (Sorry John) can teach you the ropes in all of the battlegrounds. We will not actively discourage PvP either (but seriously stop wasting time and come to MC ok?)
---
**What We Provide:** 
---
\- Hunter loot and Chuck Norris jokes
---
\- Knowhow … we were there, we did it, we had amazing time so we wanna do it again
---
\- Dire Maul sighseeing tours with a guide (Im so salty with will not be there at launch)
---
\- Friendly environment of adult people, we will all jump into the dungeon to help you with your one dumb quest and we don’t care if griding levels is more time efficient
---
\- Pooling resources, we work together to get our crafters up to speed. Epecially if you get some of them juicy patterns from the goblin in Dire Maul (Yes I love the place!), get people Onyxia cloaks and resistance gear…
---
**What Are We looking For:** 
---
\- Being casual guild makes this easy, we welcome everyone with good attitude, bad language is perfectly fine as long as it’s a joke. Insulting guildies is a no-no, but we like a good drama, just keep it civil
---
\- Open mind, WoW classic is very different from retail and if you were not there, you will just have to trust us. If anyone says something about class/spec not being viable we will mock him. If you didn’t expect group healed by druid and tanked by fury warrior with hunter jumper cables being only rez, to run DM north tribute runs, you are in for a surprise friend. You will also see paladins in cloth healing in MC, its actually really funny (Sorry John)

---
Stamina and less focus on hit rate.
---
You'll get 2 shotted by rogues as a mage. There's going to be so many rogues.
---
I've played F**nix and N*st, both had this problem, and quite persistently too.
---
It led to people abandoning zone chat altogether, had a few friends leave because they didn't want to deal with it all day.
---
Well I didn’t remember it but it’s got awful music and backpedaling enemies so it definitely checks out as an old school pvp video.
---
They had 2 hunters, prot warrior and prot paladin with a priest healing
---
The good ol' PPPPPP
---
Mages have harder counter classes then a hunter? I thought mage was the best all around pvp class
---
Dwarf hunter
---
The only thing I can think of is it means thousands more people watching and saying “hey I don’t think that’s how it worked in vanilla” yielding some bug reports, but idk. This sub just seems so divided on idolizing their achievements and hating them for the weird cult following they have
---
Wow was designed to be a casual EverQuest it's really not suppose to be hard lmao. Just imagine wiping on Rag and the whole squad go back to level 58.
---
From doing it on live many years ago. It was a very memorable experience. We were doing Uldaman and like many a run it took forever so by the time we got to the end two of our DPS had quit leaving just tank (me), healer and a mage. We kept fighting our way through and the last boss was no problem for us to sustain while slowly killing the adds, we thought we were just going to win a war of attrition, and then probably 10 mins into the fight he got all red/big and murdered us.
---
I mean if I had access to one of those...things might have been different. :P
---
Still cant see how will that affect how YOU play. You cant see what kind of UI others use. Are you saying that because i use questie, you want to use it too. I also have the advantage of having done levelup from 1 to 60 about 10-15 times. So got a general idea of ~ALL quests with or without the addon.
---
Even if everyone else uses them, you can still play the game the way you want.
---
Youre underestimating the costs of making all new content. Takes devs many months and they arent cheap
---
Would you pay 50m to make new content or rerelease BC for pure profit?you have your answer
---
You think so? I remember playing classic and my main was a troll rogue and I mainly played PVP and hunters/mages were normally the hardest 
---
and while there are more rogues in pvp than other classes, it was only like 30% and I could see people not leveling a rogue first
---
With 2 mobs on you.
---
It works the complete opposite for me. If there's a bunch of items and only 1 guy is selling them, you can bet I'm gonna be paying more attention and try to compete first chance I get.
---
Really? So only thing that makes mage stronger is if im a gnome? I thought the mage would be stronger even if human
---
If it only worked in dungeons, why would it be described as "not griefing, but a viable strategy?" When would it ever be advantageous to drag a bunch of mobs over to kill your group?
---
Unchanged Talents you mean? Probably was more fun. First 8 months of Vanilla did not have any talent revamps.
---
Warriors just have a higher noob tax. 
---
If you know what you are doing they arent as bad, thats true. but for noobs and worse player its just much more taxing than any other class really.
---
Basically for ppl that don't know what they are doing, how to quest. ppl that tunnelvision on zones and quests and as result go for higher level mobs, and struggle from glancing blows and misses. aswell as in general have weaker awareness of their enviroment and decision making and ass pull multiple mobs.
---
p.s. Most ppl wont get to 60, not only warriors. so i dont think 60% quit statement isnt true. it could be more even. from private servers experience like 10% get to 60 or so. If you just add random ppl through your leveling to your friends and track what they are doing, most dont get to 60 and quit. even ppl that you add at 20-30 level and so. most dont make it to 60.
---
yes its private servers which are free,, for classic i'd say it can be like 70-80% probably. excluding retail tourists playing just first few level. i mean ppl that actually start leveling and get somewhere.
---
honestly ppl tend to understimate how hardcore getting to 60 really is, and how much time, effort and persistence it takes, most ppl cant handle it thats just how it is.
---
It was a result of the lighting changing during Cata. The new rendering took away our darker nights.
---
Our company has one, so printing large scale pictures is not a problem luckily! :D
---
A lot of people forget that while there were many players in their teens or early 20s playing when it first launched, it was also revolutionary in that an enormous amount of its fan base were also mid 30s-40s parents and professionals. While many schedules and responsibilities have changed, the actual time investment required to accomplish great things has gone down substantially as well.
---
From what I've read and what I remember about what I read, they were in a garbage spot before they got Deathcoil in a patch.
---
Old Drakedog videos are a good way to see the history of warlock power hahaha
---
Idk I thought there're thousands of Beta testers... Didn't Blizz say they've sent "enough" invites for now?
---
People in here thinking this is the typical dungeon group you'll get in Trade Chat.
---
You'll be lucky to find a Hunter that kites that well.
---
Or a Priest that knows what he's doing.
---
Meta
---
I reported on Nostalrius back in the days and wasn't fixed months later before Nost goes down.
---
...I would be tempted to print out *so much weird shit* if I had access to one of those, just for the sake of doing it.
---
There isn't a huge difference from my memory and what I see, but there's a few things I remember from 1.5 (when I started) that are changed and I didn't know cause I never leveled an alt. Then a few other small things (like talents in the 20-40 range) that I misremember from TBC and Wrath.
---
Weirdest one for me was I was SURE Moonkin form wasn't added till TBC. I guess it was just that no one played it when I raided with lol.
---
I first thought it was the stitched elite in Duskwood 
---
(Spawned from a quest that triggers him to Attack th e town).   
---
I dont remember how many of my alts he killed.   More then I could remember.
---
Gnome is better for both pvp and pve.
---
Where are you getting these numbers?
---
Yup.
---
You're over exaggerating. If they introduced a TON of people would turn their backs - I know I would. I don't mind game being bugged. Many players used to play private servers just to get close to vanilla experience and believe me those were often bugged as FUCK. This is nowhere close to what I would call "apocalyptic load". Is it inconsistent and buggy? Yes. Is it unplayable because of that? Hell no.
---
I think what they mean with the article is that if you see a guy running with 5 mobs behind him and you trew him a healing over time. They all come back for you once the initial guy ran out of range? Not sure.
---
But im 90% sure mobs dont re-target to someone they are not in combat with and would run back to the spawn point before being able to aggro them again.
---
Its a weird written article and I dont really get it.
---
There is a big difference between racism which is very clearly seen everyday and Nazism that is made up of a handful of people.
---
Look racism exists, and most racists probably participate on T_D, but that doesn’t mean every normal person on T_D is a Nazi, or even a racist...
---
It was changed in the 3.0.8 patch (2009. January), and that, my friends, is Wrath and the achievement system.
---
My brother is very much into photography and he uses it sometimes except the clarity is a bit off compared to large professional ones.. But the resolution up to scale, and animated things looks good on it!
---
Just FYI to those who are wondering: yes, this map is misseingsome flight paths, e.g. Marshal's Refugee in Un'goro and the one in Silithus. That's because it's based on a pre-1.12 version of WoW and unfortunately there isn't a 1.12 based version.
---
Sorry for confusion, I meant Berserker the WSG/AB damage buff.
---
You use evasion to dodge disarm, hamstring (he will use piercing howl if he has it though), rend, execute and other shit that will fuck you up way more than an overpower crit.
---
I've googled that gray quests indeed give less rep in Vanilla, can go as low as 20%.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqf03u/simple_question_sunday_may_19_2019/eo9d5zq/
---
But please indeed let us know if it works this way on Beta.
---
Obviously but i wont play a gnome thats why i worded my question the way i did.
---
Unless it's with the group leader.
---
I did note that when I saw it, but I haven't been able to find one this detailed so, once I get it framed, I'm just going to use a couple of sticky-dots and a marker to draw the right ones on the glass. :P
---
Play pvp server, separate factions and do some ultimate cross faction colluding
---
The next level, being the exact same dungeon with more difficult mobs, it’s not really creating any sense of progression that raiding something like BWL would after you farm MC. It’s the same content, recycled.
---
About Us: 
---
&lt;Quidi Vidi Society&gt; is a group of vanilla players returning to the game in anticipation for WoW: Classic. We are looking for like-minded people to level and enjoy the game with. Our goal is to complete some raid content in retail before moving on to WoW: Classic leveling and raiding upon release. Our core player base is spread across Canada.
---
Guild Goals:
---
Develop a core team to enjoy classic leveling / raiding with. Our primary goal is having fun with the game.
---
Complete some raid content! We are hoping we can complete some retail content before moving on to leveling together and ultimately raiding in Classic. 
---
Most people would like to maintain their social lives if they choose to be a part of this guild. I expect most players will be somewhat casual at least. A core group of us would like to push ourselves a little further.
---
​
---
Our group is composed of previous players with mixed experience levels in raiding and content. Some of the players will not be joining us until the guild moves into classic.
---
We expect members who want to be a part of our group to: 
---
(MOST IMPORTANTLY) Be relaxed about crude humor - we love to joke around in discord and some may consider us insensitive at times. 
---
Show up to Guild activities that they have previously agreed to.
---
Be able to use discord &amp; microphones for guild activities. We want to get to know you and have fun joking around in discord :) 
---
Be understanding that a lot of our members have jobs and social lives. We choose to have some players around who are more casual than we are because we enjoy their company. 5) Be 19+ please. We are all 27 - 30.
---
**Be willing to play on a schedule that falls between NDT (Newfoundland Time / UTC -2:30) and MST (Mountain Standard Time / UTC-07)**
---
Must be willing to bring flasks / food items to raids where progression is important.
---
Must be 420 / Alcohol friendly - Although the guild is not themed around either, some guild members choose to legally partake in cannabis / alcohol in their relaxation time.
---
Bonus points if people have experience in Retail or Classic raiding. 
---
Please respond to this post if interested!
---
don't give up hope i'm sure you'll find a guild that'll take you!
---
I hear ya! But, it wasn't like that for me. I loved it. Helping each other out and building a solid community was part of what made Classic and TBC so special to me.
---
Grinded for this view 🔥🔥😩
---
Is this a troll?
---
That i enjoy a "small thing" like a videogame that is beautiful nostalgia to me? Or that my Wife is supportive on my hobbies?
---
Thank you.
---
People are telling you the best choice is hunter, but you keep asking wether it isn't mage. So it looks like you want to play a mage. Just go for it, it's also pretty damn good.
---
Kinda proves the point that flying didn't kill it though.
---
Pvp is bad for business
---
Pretty much is, and you won't be 2-shotted by many rogues, unless you're sitting, don't have any gear, and don't have Ice Barrier up. Honestly, if both sides have all their cooldowns up, mage is probably one of the strongest classes against rogues.
---
Look of course logically that's the course of action. But if like 99% of people use something, it kinda turns into the game as a whole. It's gonna make me think "ah well, if no one is going with the game as it is, why inflict this upon myself alone" you know? Like, if 10% of people have add-ons, they're ahead. If 90% people have, no one is ahead but 10% are behind. Is that more clear? If you wanna be in the majority in terms of game pace you're gonna have to download the damn add-on if it impacts gameplay enough. It's really just my perception so don't take this too seriously alright? But that's how I feel: if everyone gets into some add-ons, then what's the point in playing the original game when I'm the only one doing so?
---
Good ol Patchwerk the Tank Breaker.
---
Never saw Naxx myself but I've heard stories.
---
I think Dwarf Hunter makes more sense than Human Mage. Mage is extremely strong (if not the strongest) class in the game but outside of increased stealth detection your race doesn't really go along your class.
---
If that's the choice I'd go with Dwarf Hunter if the question is "stronger in PvP". But my question is: is that the correct question? If you want to play a Human Mage because you just find it fitting then play Human Mage! It's a game, you don't have to minmax everything if it makes it more enjoyable. : )
---
In a mostly pug BG and general world PVP, a Hunter is probably the best choice for anyone who just wants to get some easy kills and feel like a badass. If you play a Mage in this environment you will get picked off by Hunters, and without teammates to help you (since its a pug) you will likely get destroyed.
---
But in a more competitive premade scenario, you wont be able to just stand around and shoot at people as easily, and your class might not be as desirable as others. Mages are generally more desirable in this type of environment, as are Warriors for MS and Druids as flag carriers. Add in 3 healers and suddenly spots dry up for a Hunter.
---
His point was that you are so far up in your own argument that no amount of debate is going to change your mind, so there is no point trying.
---
Can’t wait to start farming for that trinket at 60
---
Oh okay thank you for clarifying!
---
This sounds like utter bullshit. “I have tested your guide”. No you haven’t. That’s a complete lie. 
---
Plus, I just clicked on Sage’s link...he clearly credits Varrak for his segments. Kind of weird how angry you are about this. Makes me wonder why.
---
That's how I always won, by outlasting and wearing down the other guy.
---
getting it took hours.  like a whole day of playing for a 1% drop rate.  and remember, no loot sharing.
---
No colorblind mode I guess. And max 10 mbps connections
---
Hello all. I would like to introduce a guild by the name of BourbonRaiders.
---
Goal: Family oriented guild looking to casually complete end game raid and PvP content.
---
Raid Hours: Friday and Saturday 8pm-12am CST (subject to change).
---
Website: bourbonraiders.guildlaunch (.com)
---
\*Guild website is a work in progress.
---
Faction: Horde
---
Server: PvP; CST North American. Will give more detail when we learn more about the different servers.
---
My BattleTag: Breakout#1905
---
We have a discord and will send invites as needed.
---
\*Again, we are a family oriented guild. We will complete raid content, but at our own pace. 
---
\*Guild is growing.
---
\*Have updated website and Discord.
---
&gt; A druid is a fast leveling class. If you are playing an average of 28 hours per week and your leveling speed is fast you will probably ding level 60 somewhere around...  Thursday 24 October 2019
---
Doubtful.  What calculations are you using for this tool?
---
Are you really wanting to play a tauren hunter?
---
No. I want to play wich is stronger. I like hunters.
---
It was EXTREMELY casual compared to 2004's standards for MMOs.
---
Getting frostlocked doesn’t make a mage die in any way.
---
Mage is the least susceptible class to interrupt due to the fact that they have 3 viable schools.
---
Get locked on frost?
---
No problem, mana shield + blink and poly and you’re good to go.
---
Yeah!
---
This is too fun! Thanks
---
Very nice  but...discouraging lol
---
which is why i said it could be different on Classic but still getting enough linen before 10 is extremely unlikely but that said.. if your playing Horde it's worth making the wand because the first quest for one is in the barrens and it's an escort so might not be up and will slow you down quite a bit if you have to wait around for it
---
pop down a windfury totem and dudes head will explode
---
Do u think being a human instead of gnome will hinder a mage at all
---
&gt; a trinket that drags people to the ground and dismounts them
---
THIS actually seems like a cool idea. Like a harpoon gun or something, earnable through PvP, that would allow you to target and dismount people on flying mounts. Give the mounted people a parachute with a limited form of control over where exactly they land, but without being able to leave the area entirely.
---
Keeps the wPvP people on PvP servers are asking for, but lets us have flying too. Obviously only have the harpoon work on PvP flagged characters.
---
Interesting point. I do like that aspect of the rogue then. I’ll definitely have to consider that as well. Thanks.
---
They're both good in wpvp. Hunter slightly better.
---
They're both good in bg's. Mage slightly better.
---
Mages are strong vs. rogues and warriors in duels. 25% of the playerbase will be eigther a rogue or a warrior.
---
My choise would be Mage. And everything I said is just my opinion based on vague memories.
---
I started in the pre-launch beta and played on and off from launch for it's lifespan, and I've played on private servers, and I've had classic beta since the first wave. I was the 4th 60 paladin on my server (Magtheridon) and within the next 2 years I also leveled a priest and raided on a warrior, mage and druid. (Friends characters, playing alt/socials tanks for 8-tank fights, etc).
---
Both private servers and classic don't feel like what I remember, but the private servers everyone dickrides (you know the ones) feel a lot more in tune with what I remember leveling through than what Classic has felt like up to level 30.
---
I don't really care, though. I'll still play it, because I'd rather play a Blizzard-stamped vanilla server than a sketchy private servers where level 60 characters appear out of nowhere 2 weeks into the server's lifespan with epic mounts.
---
Looking for EST pweek night raiding guild, preferably horde on a PVP server.
---
Playing warlock. Have both classic experience and pserver experience. Classic experience was limited due to age.
---
Please PM me if your guild is looking to recruit or you have any questions.
---
If this was modern wow: All classes - tank heal or dps, just different animations
---
wrath.  pallies were so OP.  everything was undead and we still had all these undead only spells and effects.  rotation was easy too.  i remembering pugging as a tank and always being nearly invincible
---
&gt; Shamans also "counter" mages, but in a different way. Purge ruins your Ice Armor IF he focuses you. Grounding Totem absorbs your spell, but it's kind of a rare issue in grouped PvP.
---
You're kinda forgetting earthshock here, which is a mage's bane. At the end of the day, I'd simply go UD because I wouldn't want to face Shamans as a mage. WotF also helps you out in your worst matchups, which Escape Artist doesn't really do. 
---
UD &gt; Gnome all the way, at least for PvP
---
Good ol days of taking the risk of hopping that pit in IF on your epic mount.
---
I would probably swap the E and F Column; I would just add the two hour sleep to your normal sleep to give your body max rest. I feel the two hour nap would get in MY way.
---
Right?  The hardcore among us threw that all away 15 years ago.
---
Feed your pet ! &gt;:(
---
Which french server ?
---
Duh
---
Mage and hunter are both really good farmers. Purely for farming I would go with hunter because tribute runs are a fun way of farming. Also princess runs are available in phase 1 while mages diremaul runs recuire phase 2.
---
Also if you pick hunter I would go for herb instead of mining since you will be farming high level gray items. And I think high level herbing is more profitable as high level mining since the most sold ores will probebly be iron ( mid level ) for the pvp granates.
---
I have no idea if true but this sounds right in my head.
---
See the footer of the website. Ofcourse these are very speculative. I might make an option to exclude these when making an calculation.
---
My question is why release new content when they can rereleqse abd make more money?
---
Dont think like a fan. Ever.
---
No.   Never ever once in this history of ever were Warlocks ever considered bad.
---
Cool.
---
12:00 daytime. Right after lunch. Am "starts" at midnight, so 7am, would be when you're about to wake up ish. 12am, would be mid day when classic is about to drop.
---
Wowzers, some of these are quite powerful, I wonder if blizz will reel some of them in.
---
I always preferred [Innervated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DA4x9XWz_A) myself. The editing and timing is perfect.
---
it sounds like they will balance the classes and not allow all this OP shit.  it took months or years to figure out all these tricks.  but now we all know them, so there would be everyone going for same cookie cutter builds anyway
---
Don't know if it still works, but in Wrath I used to POM + Pyro people off their mounts and then slow fall myself so I wouldn't die too.
---
Ahah, It was Cho'gall
---
12am is generally midnight or 00:00 and 12pm is lunchtime or midday
---
Most of what I see are "bugs" turning out to actually be how things were rather than what some numpty says they remember from 15 years ago or whatever private server they were playing on.
---
Was it once per hour?
---
Everquest players used to make fun of WoW back in the day for being too easy.
---
Huh, that explains why i didn't notice the reduction when i was lvling the new character. Usually any Grey quests i finished was just below green.
---
This is pretty rude. Down voting bad attitude.
---
Two first replies disagree, perfect! :P
---
Looking at blizzards release date illustration I think they mean midnight from monday to tuesday.
---
Can you tell me names of pservers that doesn't have this bug?
---
This is how threat addons determined the values:  
---
&gt;Kenco's Guide To Working Out Threat Values For Random Abilities  
---
&gt;You need:  
---
&gt;1) 	Player 1, of the class who casts the random ability  
---
&gt;2) 	Player 2, of a class who can generate threat in very small increments. The smaller the amount of threat he can create in one attack / heal / ability, the more accurate things will be. Rogues, Warriors, Hunters are bad, they can't do this at all. Classes with heal over times are excellent; the lowest level ones have very small ticks. Next best is mages and warlocks, because with no melee weapon, their autoattacks are at most 4 damage, and they probably won't have a high unarmed skill. Paladins are good too, just tell them to pretend they are DPSing the mob :D  
---
&gt;3) 	A mob to experiment on. It has to have enough HP to survive the ability that is cast on it, plus the potential damage done for player 2 to gain aggro. You also don't want it to do much damage, because it will be beating on player one for a while when player 2 is gaining threat in small quantities. I found the mobs in Wailing caverns good; as level 18 or so Elites they have enough hit points while doing low damage. Also they are in an instance, so other people can't interrupt you. Other candidates would be random level 30-40 mobs, preferably in the wilderness somewhere.  
---
&gt;General strategy:  
---
&gt;1) Player 1 does the unknown ability, then waits for any dot effects to wear off, and records the total damage. Mob will probably start beating on Player 1.  
---
&gt;2) Player 2 starts doing his small heals or wimpy autoattacks.   
---
&gt;3) When the mob aggros player 2, he records the damage / healing done when he gained aggro, and also the damage / healing done immediately before he gained aggro.

You say this as if it somehow takes away from what they achieved, of course you need to tweak the shit out of the composition and talents to get this done.
---
Sorry for not properly answering also though, itd be when it ticks over to the 27th for you.
---
Right? Flying was fun, unless you were a bad PvPer who wanted to fight people who didn't want to fight.
---
Funny they say it's not griefing when in any other game that has trains it's normally considered griefing at worst or being a cockbag at best and the sort of thing that will get you blackballed. 
---
/y TRAIN TO ZONE!!!!!
---
Its midnight between 26 and 27. thats why on the left side it’s 26th and on the right side 27th.
---
Damn that was an interesting read thank you so much for putting that much effort into answering my question.
---
I'm planning on playing a warlock. Affliction seems to be the best spec right ? And how do I deal with the limited debuff slots that I have seen mentioned in a few videos ? (In raids)
---
Thats a nice transmog link armory?
---
Good chuckle/10
---
There are no gnome hunters
---
I'd like to go with Normal / Oceanic / Horde. But we'll see how that plays out. Vanilla players might all go with PvP realms and all play Alliance.
---
I played a PvP realm in Vanilla and I was constantly vigilant so nobody would get the jump on me. I don't have it in me to put that much effort in to levelling/farming anymore.
---
Warriors are seriously fun to play...when the mobs are 3 levels below you.
---
Will there be sharding on Classic, is that why it's not so bad?
---
Hi, /u/Tenoke
---
Doing this from now on
---
Is there a reason for the comp? Like why prot pally? Are hunters extra good at 30 cap?
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Not very accurate.
---
Which pservers is this on? Didn't happen on Nostalrius.
---
For me its 6pm est time zone on the 26th so Monday the 26th at 6:00 PM I will be staying up all night long drinking loads of coffee and eating pizza while leveling my warrior. 
---
I cant wait, I'm so excited.
---
I dont remember that. I remember cleanse, cleanse, cleanse, dispel magic, dispell magic, dispel magic.  :-/
---
I mean in australia 12am is generally midnight when it ticks over to the next day/00:00 and 12pm is midday/lunchtime/the hour before 1300 so thats what im going off of, the other ine made it look like theyre the same thing.
---
eh......
---
Yep :) at least i did before writing this post
---
That’s reasonable.
---
Who originally created the file? Wasn't it /u/Teeb from barrens.chat that made that made this?
---
\&gt; log in on launch  
---
\&gt; configure UI
---
\&gt; hit lv 60
---
Thanks for the input! Haven't played classic but from what I read I feel like hunter will be my best bet.
---
Go dwarf shadow priest. 
---
Slay everyone 1v1.
---
If one was objectively stronger everyone would play it.
---
Quite worrisome that a bug like this got past the internal test team though :X
---
You can at least choose zone progression that would avoid the worst of the congestion.  For example, three Horde races funnel directly into the Barrens, so we should expect that zone to be relatively crowded compared to Tirisfal Glades.
---
Just play for fun dude. Use them if you want, don’t if you don’t. You will be miserable if you constantly worry about what everyone else is doing. A big part of the classic experience as I remember was just having a good time and not worrying about such trivial things.  
---
Just do what makes you happy and forget the rest.
---
If you have someone who can boost you for WW axe once you get to level 30, it gets better. But till MS it's pretty bad overall. I'd say the pain is mostly before you get MS. After, well you are still direct melee without CC and means of healing other than bandages. 
---
Don't know if it's exaggerated but it's definitely the worst class to level.
---
Only thing stopping me is people will harass me for heals. And i wont play a healer spec
---

---
Treebeard intensifies.
---
Just because its classic doesnt mean it really is 2004. Please chose a better word. For example, &gt;The u/warpbeast fest in this thread is quite amusing.
---
Wasn’t looking for sarcastic response. Simply saying it would be cool to get to experience the fresh low level content while there is no reason to rush to 60. Then when it’s full release go full out. 
---
Would be nice to enjoy the game while it’s fresh in both scenarios
---
"Video (Varrak)" if you believe this is enough credit sure. 
---
I have tested the guide on brotalnia's repack twice 30-60. The 1-30 is accurate and I have given praise see previous post. the 30-60 segements start off ok but by mid 40's  are way way off.  
---
Do as you wish this guy clearly trying to claim credit from others work for his own ego otherwise he would just make a more suitable title and credit people more other than "Video (Varrak)".
---
Enjoy leveling with this 40+, tried to warn you.
---
If you want to run the same spec for PvE and PvP you'll want to go for pure DPS classes.
---
You don't want to play a Rogue. So Warlock and Hunter are good choices.
---
I loved my Warlock through vanilla, the skill ceiling is fairly high on it, you can crowd control mobs using fear with curses to yo-yo them back and forth. You can do very high damage, you can summon.
---
I already have an invite, had one since the start. Only reason I asked is because my contact at Blizz stated invites are still rolling out when I asked him over the weekend.
---
I got the feeling that grinding to R14 is something you probably cant do if you plan on spending any significant time with a SO lol.
---
Oh I'm so bloody happy necrosis is being updated. I died a little inside when that addon stopped working in bc
---
same here started in wotlk (22 yo)
---
As a flyer who plays wow this is the largest meme I've ever seen
---
awesome 🤣
---
&gt; If hes a nice guy doing his best, 
---
But he, quite literally wont be if he picks a bad spec.
---
Yeah I miss those days. The players will be much better now so priests can expect to spend a lot of time polymorphed, viper drained, stunlocked, and focused.
---
Bro, you got some serious FOMO going on in this thread.
---
I’m a pretty short lanky dude and when my brother returned from the military he was super buff. We went to the movies and I sat crossed leg in the chair and he just looked at me and asked “how do you do that?” Confused I asked “do what?” And then he proceeds to try to bring one leg up but he couldn’t. Couldn’t even bring his arms within the arm rests.
---
It's not a "duh" situation because many people are posting and replying to these video highlights as hype for Classic and getting excited over what is effectively a version of the game they will never play. Underlevelling dungeons with a level 30 twink group isn't remotely representitive of classic.
---
Of course I would get downvoted for not drinking in the hype, it's a cool thing that they did but let's not get carried away.
---
Would love to hear what you think! Drop me some feedback via the provided link.
---
Buy your Remove Curse spell. Congratulations, you're better than 99% of mages in vanilla.
---
&gt; In which scenario? Raiding? 
---
Hit me up on discord: Zunneh#8369 :)
---
I don’t know if I’ll like with so many addons existing ... i mean it’s Classic shouldn’t ppl play retail when they want to play with all these functions
---
But I think  as long as it’s something visual it’s ok I guess
---
Payo - Rogue ofc
---
This is pretty hard due to class&amp;race limitations...
---
* Druid: Tauren - All around better than NE
---
* Hunter: Night Elf - Shadowmeld w stealth cat
---
* Mage: Gnome - 5% int is nice
---
* Paladin: Human - No other choice 
---
* Priest: Dwarf - FW OP
---
* Rogue: Undead - Cannibalize self heal &amp; wotf ofc
---
* Shaman: Troll - Faster heals
---
* Warlock: Orc - Stun res and pet dmg for Rogues
---
* Warrior: Gnome - EA is amazing for Pvp
---
9 Classes, 8 races. Had to double up one.
---
And one really bad cleanse keybind he never hits unless he has 10 debuffs on himself.
---
Truths hurt.  Someone has to remind people why they’re called “OOM-kins”
---
My feeling exactly : I'd take twice harder levelling for more mobility tools in PVP.
---
You need to be extremely well geared as a warrior to enjoy PVP, this is certainly not a class for casuals.
---
Thanks for the heads-up! I hope we'll see stuff like this on the classic RP servers.
---
Rule number 1: Cardio.
---
Female Orc, solid armor coverage and they actually wear boots ( unlike troll, undead, Tauren)
---
I think leveling you will have to heal dungeons but when you get lvl 60 you can go full shadow and just do your thing. Always a spot for a shadow priest in raids and you can pvp  with the same spec.
---
Nost had it as well(during first few weeks at least), but it was _horrible_ on f**nix.
---
I don't either. I can't think of a time I've ever seen this happen. But then, vanilla was a long time ago.
---
you should sell these on etsy or some shit i would totally buy one off ya
---
I'm going Troll this time, hopefully Shadowguard blackout procs will ease the damage I suffer a little from melee. I'm going to be that annoying gnat spamming Hex of Weakness, Dispel and Mana Burn.
---
1 minute after 23:59 on August 26th and 1 minute before 00:01 on August 27th assuming you're in the same time zone as Paris.
---
It just recently popped up I believe, they probably changed something else that had this effect they didn’t expect.
---
yeah, i cant build my interface in peace when all my friends want to level with me and it kinda annoys me to play with standard UI for the first weeks
---
Agreed. Leveling and questing through the post cata Azeroth has been a lot of fun.
---
Not sure, actually. I dug back through some googlin' and found a post on the retail subreddit from 2017 though, https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5udhly/hd_map_of_the_azeroth_presundering/
---
It's also...seemingly everywhere. I see a lot of posts about it on Amazon for sale as a poster print, pintrest, etsy, etc.  I mean, credit where credit's due; whoever put in the work for the actual map itself deserves props for fleshing it out like this.
---
yeah, it's not level 30 content.
---
Just 1 rppvp server for NA.
---
How about using google next time.
---
Just go bear and AOE taunt when somebody is about to die. Then shift back caster and die first to hide your shortcomings. That way your group will never know you can't res them. You can even bitch at them while you walk back!
---
Maybe for the trash. Couldn’t handle Mograine/whiteman though I don’t think
---
Haha, I can't claim to have done the map image itself, I just found the map-maker service to put it on canvas and wanted a nice little center piece for the game room!
---
Don’t forget the enemy gets a crit in the middle of that
---
I bought my dad a foot pedal because otherwise he'd click his items (way back in DotA 1), he's been using it since and even bought another foot pedal to duel wield. Best investment ever!!!
---
How about offering something constructive next time?
---
Yeah I saw almost the exact same thing on Frostadamus' stream. Got over 10 potions from one chest.
---
Just trying to help those pre obsessed about a solved game
---
*Bonjour*,
---
We're a French semi-hardcore guild with the goal of fully cleaning the PVE content of each phase with only 2 days of raiding per week.
---
**🕖 Raid information**
---
*Presence in raid is mandatory for members of the roster.*
---
Raids starts at 20h45 (first pull) and ends at 23h45 (last pull).
---
* Phase 1: Raids on Wednesday, Thursday
---
* Phase 2+: If it's necessary to add another raiding day for farming, it will be Sunday
---
👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 **What you can expect from us**
---
* A friendly and highly-motivated group to xp to 60
---
* Outdoor PvP outside of raiding time
---
* Full clear of PvE content (without aiming for server firsts)
---
* Community to play other games (LoL, Overwatch, etc) while waiting for the release
---
* purpl l00tz?
---
🕵️ **What we expect from you**
---
* Be nice and respectful with people
---
* Keep it serious during raiding time
---
* Use a keyboard, turn your screen on, move out of AOEs
---
**🤝 How to join**
---
Contact me through Discord! My handle is : Strift#0812
---
*Au revoir,*
---
&gt;  For example, instead of just doing Barrens or just doing Silverpine, do both at the same time, ie: get 2 levels in Silverpine, then get 2 levels in Barrens etc.
---
While you are correct in principle, Silverpine is a waste of time. You mix in Stonetalon, Ashenvale, Wailing Caverns instead. If you have low knowledge of quests do RFC too. There's no reason to take the Zeppelin until you're going Hillsbrad.
---
Reminds me of swifty’s Gaming house setups
---
I like a 40 tank with the others from 37-40 for a smooth run. Can push a little lower.
---
Do it during a stress test. Easy
---
Lol what’s the point of a community engaging and discussing ideas &amp; questions if they just get directed to engage with a search engine.
---
You’ve embarrassed yourself so much with your moronic statements that you should probably just start a new account. Man. Start a new life, change, save yourself from yourself.
---
I just answered but got my comment auto-deleted. It's the one that launched version I simultaneously with the biggest vanilla server ever, version II when that one died, and is currently in version III.
---
It has been working there for a very, very long time.
---
This information was true when Ironfoe came out, but Blizzard nerfed it by the end of vanilla. It can't proc from itself nor can it proc Windfury or the trinket. The Extra Attacks that it makes are just extra attacks without bonus proc chances but they are still amazing. The initial auto hits can proc windfury and all that, so in theory yeah you can still get 1 auto attack hit + 2 from weapon + 1 WF (2 if shaman) + 1 Hand of Justice.
---
Would be amazing to see that in a pvp setting.
---
&gt;So you are just ignoring the part where I presented evidence that is not from a pserver?
---
Thank god you never did any sort of development on private servers then.
---
Did... she just sniff the gloves before handing them to you?
---
There’s some info in the footer of the page.
---
Add me on discord Zunneh#8369
---
Why are you here?
---
Yeah i would just sub and opt in, youll likely get into the stress test, pick an odd time to log in on the stress test so you get in easy then just take your time getting key bindings and addons all set up. They should be saved for launch unless the remove the beta client from all of us and make us reinstall the launch client
---
Could you, like, not spam this daily? There's dedicated discords and threads for recruitment.
---
I loved attunements in TBC as well but OMG it was so hard to level up and attune your alt. I just made a twink instead :)
---
I like your approach.
---
Considering you will be able to login.
---
I guess the most dangerous times are launch, tuesday 17:00, Friday 16:00  , and the weekend..   
---
Depending on your leveling speed and class I guess lvl 50 would be feasible if you cut on sports a bit
---
&gt;no loot sharing.  so a priest could get it
---
If you farm Ironfoe without reserving it you are an idiot, so moot point.
---
The average run takes about 30-40 minutes depending on how fast you can put the group together.
---
This is how you end up on dead servers few months after launch.
---
&gt;PlusFyraSex
---
What does it mean ? Sounds kinky :D
---
It’s not painful if you enjoy eating and bandaging as 1/2 your game play
---
Yeah level 30 you shit on rogues though
---
It's a guesstimate built on some assumptions. I'm sure the calculations are perfectly accurate.
---
&gt;  I know I would 
---
Yeah, just like everyone said that they would leave if any form of sharding/phasing was in classic, funny how that worked out
---
You are wearing sunglasses &amp; a seatbelt to play a game, plus you use joystick and no wasd keys to move. 
---
You are probably joystick turner too. 
---
"Ready to stand in fire" setup imho.
---
That's it, no dungeons for you!!!
---
yeah, if I didn't want to open up a dialogue i would have went to google or YouTube. Came here to talk to like minded individuals on a subject I'm excited and interested in. The audacity of me...
---
Well if they both are in the same honor farming raid they are probably going to spend more time together than ever :p
---
It actually sounds like you are the one being confused about spell batching mate
---
Can confirm. Played original a week after launch due to friends convincing me it was better then FF11 (think that was the first final fantasy mmo right?). I fell in love.
---
Was a teen so lived on the game every second I could. Raided up to 4 horsemen in naxx. I can say without a doubt that there were guilds that beat everything first just like today.. They wanted the bragging rights.
---
Also, as they were the ones learning and progressing, they put their bragging videos up as soon as stuff was downed.
---
It was a requirement that EVERYONE watch the videos prior to attempts. If even a single person said they didn't have time to watch it, our raid leader would make everyone chill while they watched it.
---
We also had multiple websites for information. Yes, it wasn't as crazy as today, but there was still a wealth of information out there. So much so that there were a few people that found out crazy broken combos or farming methods and would keep it insanely secret to not ruin / get them nerfed by blizz. Sometimes they would sell said secrets for massive amounts of gold.
---
Well yeah, Reddit has never not been retarded.
---
Quite interesting. I was under the impression that BWL patch was the first raid that had bosses with enrage timers to counteract the fact that guilds just kept throwing healers into MC and it made fights overly boreing.
---
Nice!  It will be awesome if you get peels and some support.
---
Word spreads so quick. I love that
---
lol'd pet attack and auto shot, sick skills mate
---
This is true. We need more beta testers that trying every small thing in the game. It's 2 months left and most (not all) streamers just focusing on content, pvp or lvling routes.
---
I have seen Blizzard after introducing WSG absolutely fix some big stuff and some small things. So they definitely seeing the bug reports. We just need more "nerds" and beta testers in general. Blizzard, you have so many competent testers ready to help you doing this classic experience almost perfect.
---
yep- nothing triggers me harder than dying in game, paladin born and bred
---
Where's all the NA late night guilds at? I'm a previous vanilla WoW player looking for a semi-hardcore progression guild. Faction doesn't matter but raid times preferred after 10:30 PM CST. Late night shift workers unite!
---
While his routing and planning are good his mechanics are not top tier.
---
It's not arriving until phase 3, along with BWL ([source](https://www.wowhead.com/news=290629/staggered-classic-content-update-six-phases-up-from-four-to-address-itemization-)).
---
&gt;roughly 20% procrate
---
Source? I'm just mildly annoyed every time people pull numbers out of their butt.
---
Well, that's tough to say. There is no class that only uses 2 or 3 spells in PvP, so I'm not sure there's anything you'd be happy with.
---
That being said, I think "least amount of active skills" is a bad metric to chose a class by, just pick something you like and go with it.
---
People are allowed to be excited and excited about user created challenge in a capped beta. Don't be a bitch
---
It was prot warrior, prot paladin, priest and 2 hunters that both had tigers
---
&gt;I ask because on pservers they are stacked additively  
---
This is a blatant lie, the vast majority of pservers are based on mangos where it scales multiplicatively.
---
Ah yes, I love to be *All Types*.
---
But then some of these obviously got some more attention (Warrior) than others (Druid) going by their descriptions.
---
Funny to read though.
---
Aren't Paladins and Warlocks basically the same players?
---
Funny gang - they have series on YouTube of the other ones they have done. They get really into it and it’s worth watching.
---
This is the exact problem with the "Everyone I don't like is Hitler" attitude, though. When somebody actually *is* a nazi, it's hard to get anyone to care because pewdiepie is a nazi and jontron is a nazi and anybody who holds any opinions right of center is a nazi etc
---
You're definitely right, I shouldn't care about that, but I mean if I didn't care at all about other people I wouldn't need Classic, I'd go on a pserver and grind alone
---
Hello,
---
I'm NA (mountain time , PST + 1)
---
I plan to play PvP server, Alliance.
---
Looking for two things: first is a solid guild for classic release, other is a committed partner to level with on classic release. By committed I mean willing to level together as much as possible for the first week, for me that will be a pretty good amount each day.
---
I'm looking for a guild that will be raiding relatively soon after classic release, as well as grouping to farm HKs during phase 2 and premade BGs in phase 3
---
I'm 23 and plan to play quite a bit when the game comes out
---
I was young when vanilla was out originally, but have played much wow since. cleared a lot of raid content over the years, was 2200 in arena and 2100 in rbgs so I really enjoy both sides of the world... Of Warcraft. 
---
I plan to roll paladin or mage, paladin if I can deal with the less action packed and  slower leveling of paladins. I'd heal as pala at 60, but not 100% set on paladin as I have always wanted to mage.
---
Reply or msg me on here, I prefer to chat extensively on discord though. Get back to me and I can shoot you my discord. Thanks :)
---
I mean I'm human, I'm bound to have some flaws buddy
---
So you are standing in front of the quilboar camp. You can't charge in, because you would pull 3 of them. You could shoot one. But you are in combat you can't charge anymore. You can bloodrage and start swinging. Or even better, you shoot the mob and it starts casting a frostbolt. You are in combat. You start running the other way, slowed, to pull the mob away. Once far enough you turn back, slowed, to fight a mob. And then you eat. As you are chewing in your food, you look to your right. A mage runs in to a pack of 8. All of them slowed by frost armour. They are frozen in place by frost nova. They are dying from arcane explosions and cone of cold. You finish your meal and look for the next mob to shoot and fight for another 40 seconds.
---
Absolutely loved this!
---
Not sure if true but I would guess that Naxx could be done by an 35man opptimal minmax group. Having spots for 5 less optimal specs. Not sure if these numbers are right but there is always room for a few non-optimal specs.
---
Changes to get in a serieus raiding guild will decline drasticly if you decide to pick a 'meme' build but its not inposible.
---
I dont want to scare people into playing the few optimal specs because people will probebly not reach the hard raids anyway.
---
Play something you like is the most inportand goal, clearing all raids comes second imo.
---
"Ps: if you really plan on clearing all pve content you should pick a 'meta' build".
---
Awesome, thank you so much!
---
Nice one! Thanks
---
You can though.
---
You can't do the quests obviously, but you can have a full raid doing low level dungeons.
---
Warlocks are mushrooms.
---
Gonna have a gf who is going to play priest, im not dying this time around.
---
I tried taking their advice, and googled it. Couldn't find anything relevant. It's mostly old forums talking about what it was like in vanilla.
---
So many people on here just want us googling everything, even if the answer can take six hours to find. What's the point of a subreddit if we're just supposed to research all day?
---
Hahahahaha I’m on Reddit very infrequently - and the point of my post was not that I ran instances with them but that I’m in the guild and I refuted your statement that they don’t purge the frequently of tons and tons of people who are non streamers - seeing as you don’t have beta - yet you know so much of what’s going on in it. 
---
You can throw your low efforts at me you want but you’re the one crying about a beta. Here’s a juice box kid.
---
Sucks for people who work and have a family like me. I'll be lucky to get 10 hours a week (thinking 3-4 friday and saturday nights if I stay up late when everyones asleep lol)
---
Autism
---
Sports? Classic has sports
---
O rly?
---
I just remember them earth shocking every longer cast.  You can’t fear them because of tremor totem.  I forget the name of the totem that absorbs a spell.  They weren’t a cake walk if they were good.  I dueled a lot and I found them to be one of the harder matchup.
---
So I'm at fault? :D
---
Mages had a spell in the arcane tree that would allow for an instant cast sheep so you would sheep a target, cast a pyroblast swiftly followed by another inatant pyro. Yea very fun build and really strong with on use spell dmg trinkets.
---
I'm more interested in gameplay guides
---
Yeah this was my main concern - cause I've never really enjoyed healing but I don't mind healing while dpsing if need be but I wouldn't want that to be my main responsibility.
---
We still do even though we play it.
---
No silly, it's a dwarf.
---
Lmao "aggressively waiting" that made me chuckle
---
&gt;Save
---
What is real life like for you? I'm interested because it's gotta be real damn interesting if you're actually thanking people for liking your comment on a reddit post for a 15 year old video game.
---
&gt; that we now know through the power of hindsight to be troublesome and bad for the game.
---
In your opinion, lets not go throwing the "we" word around, when you absolutely do NOT represent everyone in the community.
---
Personally, I thought flying was awesome, and the ongoing Blizzard temper tantrum over it is one of the reasons I no longer sub to retail. Flying only removed non-consensual pvp, which in my opinion, is a good thing. PvPers just found out how much of dick they were actually being to people when nobody wanted to play with them anymore.
---
I'd agree LFG should probably go, as that actually did end up destroying server communities.
---
Yeah I've heard that, but I've also heard that the meta that the patch is based on saw a lot more feral viability. I'm not sure how true that is
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
&gt;A hunter is a fast leveling class. If you are playing an average of 168 hours per week and your leveling speed is super-fast you will probably ding level 60 somewhere around...
---
Monday 2 September 2019
---
&gt;(this will be 7 days from when you start playing on 27 August 2019)
---
I'm pretty sure that should be 4 days considering the speed is Joana, Hunter and playing 24/7.
---
*shrug* I've gotten 60 cloth by 10 both times I did the run. Will test on the stress test.
---
As for the essence, if your RNG is shit you can go for the essence from the vendor (8 silver) which should be there on fresh launch.
---
No joke I can’t play Orc females/human males/undead females because their running animations are toilet tier.
---
You're so going to over pull.
---
Never played druid back in the day, do you have to be in combat to rez? Or does it just waste your brez cooldown when you use it out of combat
---
Fuck 2 handers.
---
Yep, wotlk seems to be the last true expansion people enjoyed.
---
That being said - I feel like Warrior may be the "correct" choice since I want to tank and they're known as "The Tank". I'm just worried that since I'll only be playing a little on the weekends - gearing it will be difficult - and the class is very gear dependent or so I've read.
---
I'm not playing classic since Cata cause it sucks, I joined back for WoD for a couple of months because I always liked Orcish lore and it was full of it.
---
Most popular expansion in the history of the game.
---
&gt; It wasn't a good expansion
---
Lol, okay.
---
A sewer with plumbing that tilts inwards towards the city center.
---
I played a druid tank through Lich. I raided in numerous guilds through that time. I could not main tank. Bears just don't have the toolset that warriors do. Aggro wasn't the problem, getting fucking melted by at least 1/4 of the bosses was. So I mostly tanked trashed and dps'd bosses. From my personal experience of actually doing it and being active in the druid boards and groups at the time, a druid off tank brings more to the raid than a warrior off tank. Saving the raids resources on trash and letting the MT's focus on the bosses and bringing more dps than a warrior off tank. The thing about druid tanking is that gearing and getting the gold/resources to buy/craft potions/flasks to be useful and to earn a spot takes much more effort than a warrior needs to exert for the same level of usefulness. It's not "harder" just more effort.
---
But druids are fucking boss so it was worth it to me.
---
PS this only applies to 40's, I had no issue MTing any other situation and I was not a top tier druid tank. Prot pally's literally have no taunt so there is no chance they could tank any portion of a 40.
---
Finally someone who gets me and someone who actually appears to have read the entire thread, and actually replied to it, other comments have nothing to do with the actual thread...thank you. And yes, I've seen how mechanical flightpaths look now and I hope they change it! 
---
Even though I've lost faith in Blizzard many years ago, I'm impressed with Classic Team's response time to any bug reported here on reddit, so I'm positive they'll fix it!
---
This is the best way for you to play without any experience. You get to experience it fresh!

feels good "supporting" my enemies to the spirit rezer

There is no doubt that Alliance is better at level 30 at this type of thing due to Paladin buffs, but there were definite improvements that could be made to Soda's comp, and Soda not dping is probably one of them.
---
Every class have counter to some other class/spec. Some classes have counters to a lot more classes/specs than others. Hunter and Mage are both very strong.
---
The choice should simply come down to which of those classes you enjoy the most.

ABOUT US:
---
Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
We are striving for an enjoyable launch experience by streamlining levelling and pre-raid gearing through cooperation and communication. It takes a team to clear raid smoothly. The same goes for levelling, questing, and gearing. We are looking for players who will put in the effort to ensure that our team is in the best possible shape, not individual characters. We will conduct our first raid at the end of the second raid reset. Subsequent raids will aim to be fast and efficient each week Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST. 
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need some major poopsocking on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.
---
APPLY TO ATLAS:
---
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Problem with that is you have to remove one of your fingers from wasd which you may be using for movement.  Makes hitting something like ctrl q difficult.
---
There really is no other word to describe that chain of comments started by u/BadAssPleb
---
Sheep, cast fireball, pom, pyroblast, fireblast
---
You will shoot a fireball + pyroblast + fireblast that hits the target at the same time. It hurts.
---
Yea there were already some weird auto shot/auto attack bugs and in guessing they tried to fix that and somehow broke the quivers/ammo pouches.
---
honestly you should just play tauren hunter then
---
That was so funky, and just after the joy, stabed by a f.. rogue ;-)
---
You only made 1 mistake.  
---
You are planning to log in back around 16/17 o'clock? Then you can calculate 1 hour less into your playtime. Because you can expect to wait in a queue.  
---
So my plan is to sleep during the prime time (after work/school), because I expect some server problems during that time.
---
I still support streamers , they are really doing a good job so far but there should be more people.  They were more supportive and they were spending more efforts on finding bugs at the beginning of beta, but now they only seem to focus on content, gearing, pvp etc. I dont blame them because its an amazing content for them and twitch is their only income.
---
We just need more people, thats all.
---
\[b\]\[NA\]\[H\]\[PvP/PvE\]LF GUILD \[/b\] 
---
\[b\]About us\[/b\] We are three+ IRL friends who've played since vanilla and are looking to get back together for Classic. We are looking for a mature semi-hardcore PvE/PvP guild to clear all raid content and push PvP ranks and run pre-made BGs.
---
\[b\]What we bring to the table\[/b\] Mature players. Everyone with moderate to significant Vanilla experience. Raiding experience with top 100/200 US/World guilds across multiple expansions. PvP players who have achieved 2200+ in Arenas and/or RBG across multiple seasons on retail. Humor. 
---
We will be playing Lock, RSham, DPS Warr with a possibility of +1.
---
\[b\]What we are looking for\[/b\]
---
* Mature players
---
* Active guild
---
* Clear PvE raid content within appropriate amount of time after release
---
* 2 raid nights 6-8 hours/week 
---
* Can raid EST between 7-12pm, any two days WED/FRI/SAT
---
\[b\]Contact Me\[/b\] Add me of discord LYF3#0798 if you think you have a guild that suits our needs.
---
Not a fan on streamers, but to each their own.
---
&gt;Obviously you people never played vanilla
---
The irony is strong here.
---
We have a guild facebook group going with old friends who used to play together between vanilla and wotlk. We are currently 160 in the group, so we are hoping to get enough people to 60 to gather a 40-man raid at least 3 times a week. (You don't have to participate every raid).
---
Hit me up if you want to join in :)
---
Feenix?
---
That was so good ;-)

Friday morning, I ran some tests in the Beta on known quests and they gave full rep when gray. However, after Friday afternoon’s WSG patch, I ran some more tests and verified that rep decay is now in effect for gray quests. You can see the results of my tests in this thread:
---
/r/classicwow/comments/bshono/regarding_rep_gains_on_grey_quests_closed_beta/
---
I just tested on Lightbringer (one of Lighthope servers)
---
https://imgur.com/a/8PYwcMm
---
It was also bugged on Nost back in the days but I don't have a screenshot to show it. It's also bugged on my own offline mangos server.
---
I can't speak for all pservers but I've been playing on one for the past year and not once did I ever encounter a nazi or anyone talking about anything even remotely related, your comment is the first time I'm hearing about this issue. At any rate blizzard servers wont tolerate that shit with the reporting system.
---
Comedy aside, it does put forward the concept of authenticity rather than sticking entirely to the 1.12 numbers.
---
Very few of us who actually played back then, did things like Wailing Caverns, Deadmines, RFD etc. during 1.12. It's hard to argue that the game didn't get easier over the course of its lifespan. Plus, of course, players got a ton better since (hard to correct for that one though). Or things like latency and framerate. 
---
Private servers being more of a challenge does sound like a shame to me, at least.
---
I actually like the description since its the opposite as are the magics they use shadow/holy. To me hating to lose and loving to win are different concepts. For example,  you are fine with a draw or not engaging, but losing enrages you and the other side just tries to do everything to win, even aggressively looking for conflict.
---
Agreed. Max level reminds me of directv, so many options but nothing on. Like there’s a ton of content, and some of it is fun with friends, but there not much compelling me to want to do it.
---
Leveling and questing through the post cata Azeroth though has been a lot of fun.
---
The main reason for splitting up my sleeping time is that I think I need a break inbetween, the gaming session would be too long, I am getting old I guess
---
Combo system + spender in all brackets
---
Most of us have more than 20 IQ. You dont.
---
Just stop talking.
---
I tought pyroblast had a cooldown? So it was fireball into pyroblast. I could be wrong tho.
---
Yes it will be there from the beginning and stay that way all through Classic. Blizzard has already confirmed it IIRC
---
Seen this already.
---
Gayer than cum on a moustache
---
I am OK with having all the addons that were in vanilla (or another version of it), none of that QoL bullshit from retail.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about, and the worst part is you dont even realize it.
---
Haha! That's great, I was drunk too, definitely poke the bear mode.
---
Nope your doing something beside wow and sleep
---
your doing it all wrong you gotta drop the sports if you wanna be SERIOUS.
---
What will really end their progress is aggro radius. After a certain point they'll be aggroing additional packs due to low level and coupled with having a small health pool it will be too much for the healers to heal.
---
vuhdo appears to be working flawlessly for me so far
---
I just looked in to pricing this for myself and it costs £130 / $164 before delivery to get one with the same mesaurements as yours. Bit of the expensive side but I'm still tempted lol
---
They are reasonably good during low gear phase of character and when they gear up they become S tier face melters.
---
Yes, Presence of Mind  in arcane tree and Pyroblast... that was that :) , thx.
---
Unfortunately I think this may be a bug. I hope it remains unfixed, I'd love having this many mana potions drop from a chest.

Skip or reduce the alcohol intake, it messes with the quality of your sleep: [https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/how-alcohol-affects-quality-and-quantity-sleep](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/how-alcohol-affects-quality-and-quantity-sleep)
---
For me it was the first time I got to the Sepulcher with the moon and stars out, music playing. Dunno exactly why but it's stuck with me ever since the beta. I initially parked my character over night when leveling on a rocky outcrop there. This was before I realised what rested XP was.....
---
For me sleeping during the day ruins my sleep later at night, perhaps try one day as you have it (4hr sleep) and one day with the full 6hr sleep and see what feels better. Also you could sit on one of those exercises balls for a couple hours instead of your computer chair plus whatever sport your doing.
---
He is playing a paladin, he doesn't need pedals.
---
I stream, albeit i am new and only doing it so i can share my Beta experience ..... But I actively am trying to break things, find bugs, and doing all the content provided to find those bugs. So there are some looking to help fix the game, cause dammit i want a bug free release day, and the best experience for all players in an as close to Vanilla experience as possible! I have done at least 30 bug reports, and I always try to make sure i can replicate it, and provide possible fixes before submitting.
---
Thank you for reminding me why I should roll rogue.
---
&gt; literally only two months
---
How do you manage to fit 91 days into 2 months? That's impressive.
---
The fact that you think that's relevant just blows me away, 8k people is such a small number compared to how many people are going to be playing classic, and they'll be split up between several different servers.
---
I’m so mad at myself for not saving my guides that came with the battle chest. No idea what happened to them
---
Both very good at pve, pvp and leveling. Its up to you really. Personally I would go with a mage because I like playing them more. Although human makes no sense for mage better to go with gnome.
---
The build is called PoM Pyro or 3-Minute Mage
---
Some people got more than one character but you're right anyway
---
Idk about "60% of warriors will quit", but as someone who played warrior in vanilla I can vouch for how slow and hard it is. If you're leveling with a friend it's a completely different story, I'm talking about solo. People are better at the game and know more about quest locations / leveling routes now so I'm sure it'll be easier than back in the day for most people, but don't underestimate just how bad warriors are pre-40ish lol, especially without a healer or some kind of back up.
---
You use pom in arcane tree to transform a spell with cd to instant one
---
She's crying... because of her dead husband?
---
It's "Deadmines", as it's less letters to type out the full thing than it is to make topics debating it.
---
Yeah, it put me at like April next year. I'm pretty fine with that though.
---
I'll get there in time and I'm sure there will be plenty of casuals/people with little time, like me wanting to do endgame content then too. Probably it will be more enjoyable even when the tryhards have all moves on.

No one is forcing you to speed level. There's nothing wrong with a break from questing/grinding to work on profs or farm a dungeon for some big upgrades. The average player will spend 8-12 days played leveling to 60. There will be a small percentage on each server (&lt;20%) that will be 60 in the first week. 
---
The only difference is they are forced to do SM Cath as lvl 30s, you could do that if you want, and they have a lvl 30 only WSG instead of having only 10-19, 20-29, ect brackets.
---
Gotta spend money to make money baby
---
I have to like looking at my toon. I hate gnomes.
---
And it will be the healers fault lol
---
Bring your numbers advantage - you’ll need it.
---
I would have to log off and go to my friends house to use his better computer to go through Ironforge. The only possible way I could get through IF was looking at the ground fully zoomed in and go left towards the mage training area.
---
Stuck in combat - bug?  
---
Approximately one second into the following clip you can see the warrior use intimidating shout (fear). The warrior does not attack or perform any actions that would keep him in combat, and yet he doesn't leave combat untill about 12-13 seconds after he used intimidating shout.  
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/PricklyPoliteWeaselTebowing  
---
   
---
People in the twitch chat during this clip are saying it's because of the rogues Garrote, and that Bleed damage keeps one in combat for the full duration. I've tried to do some research about this but haven't found any proof that this is true. Also in the clip you can see that the warrior actually leaves combat while Garrote is still active and ticking for damage. So that kinda nullifies that theory I guess, unless that is also a bug.  
---
Another theory could be that the warrior is stuck in combat because of Bloodrage. It could be that warriors does not leave combat untill 5 seconds after Bloodrage has finished or been canceled. However, I play warrior myself and I have really no memory of this being the case, ever. My mind could be tricking me, but i'm pretty sure that warriors (should) leave combat instantly after Bloodrage if the warrior haven't been in actual combat for +5 seconds.
---
The interval between batches is static, the time between your cast and the next batch isn't.
---
Honestly I think this guy explained it much better than you did.
---
It was a little bit of a troll build but.... ;-)
---
You should consume alcool only on weekends / rest day.
---
Even more when you do sport, it affects so much your body.
---
Sounds fun on the surface, but I can’t help but feel like blizzard promoting unhealthy amount of gaming isn’t a good idea in this day and age.
---
Because you know the people who win that type of stuff are staying awake for 2-3 days strait grinding

I'll have to go back and look at the options..it shouldn't be THAT expensive...I used the 'custom' size and put in the details and it only billed me initially for that 111.  Yeesh.
---
12 buttons on a mouse.... that sounds like Id miss the button im trying for 60% of the time, lol
---
It would just be exploited through trading HKs with the opposite faction. That already happened during vanilla but it would be even worse today.
---
And you are still not very intelligent, must be as soft as a wet noodle.
---
You didn't play early Vanilla apparently
---
Never liked addons/mods for any game, sad to see all this stuff up and ready to go on day one. People just can't play games anymore as they come out of the box. Lazy,No good players who don't want to be left behind so they do what they can to stay ahead with everyone else racing to whatever there is to race to in a remaster. 
---
Game isn't even out yet and the same addons that helped retail get to where it's at, are already waiting for classic. It's like nobody learned anything. What would also help Classic be unique from private servers is disabling the use of addons. Imagine a video game being played......all by itself. 
---
We are suppose to be doing something here to defeat the purpose of playing on a private server. If blizzards servers are exactly the same as a private server, why would I pay to play on one when I can play the other for free? Because sometimes the servers get shut down? Boo Hoo, I've had everything Vanilla has had to offer,it isn't amazing. It isn't about collecting a bunch of crap, it's just about playing the game with people who love the same game. Servers can restart over and over and over again, as long as there's people to play with, I'm playing.
---
This addon stuff is actually ridiculous. What's next? Classic Retail? come on
---
Im a bit confused what you mean here?
---
What is this tipsout trying to get upvotes...
---
 Here is proof that the numbers are right so yea for sure nice try m8.

---
You may hit a problem with your class quests being only on your race's warlock trainer. So if you expect a class quest at 10 but don't see it you may be taking that zeppelin back home for a bit.
---
To clarify, if you ran engaged mobs close enough to OTHER engaged mobs, the combats would chain together. Once you yourself got out of combat those chasing you would naturally go to the still engaged players (this happened without you breaking combat if someone healed \[AoE threat\]). 
---
It was never about mobs aggroing on their way back where they would normally evade. The chaining had to be done before you broke combat.
---
This was a viable strategy to get hostile (and allied) players off your grindspots in for example Tyr's hand.
---
\#twitchplayswow
---
Yep, hunters destroy higher lvl mobs. The 2 hunters were doing 50dps while asmon and esfand were doing 5
---
Warrior - Very Slow - 1 hour
---
You will probably ding somewhere around Tuesday 6 August 2030
---
Most streamers would just claim the videos tho. Asmongold not he even said he doesnt care because its capitalism. Plus he gets a ton of free marketing out of it too. Its like a win win for him.

There was a blue post saying they have reached the numbers they want for beta / stress test servers and will be slowing down invites going out. I'm at work but I'll try to find it.
---
I am seeing way more Alliance than Horde on NA. I hope to see more H guilds recruiting as we get closer to launch. 
---
I am looking to join a guild on [NA][PvP][H].
---
Tought It would only make it instand. Good to know.
---
Could use it ooc, but was a long ass cd with useage of mats.
---
Thats something to consider, ty.... now I want snacks
---
I assume you mean pvp
---
Most mages seem to pref gnome, partially for the racial, but also because of paladin vs shaman. And ofc horde facing lots of gnomes
---
Build it during flights. Lots of time to fine tune, and it's easy to level with bars and unit frames ajar. Especially at low levels.
---
[This](https://youtu.be/_GumyLbBf4o)
---
To me one of the funnest things about wow is that you can tune the difficulty yourself.  I'm playing with 3 other friends when the game comes out, and we'll be 4 manning every instance 2-3 levels earlier than the recommended level.  We'll all have professions to provide help to everyone else in the group.  Potions, enchants, engineering, etc...  We had such a fun time fighting through gnomer at 27 on a pserver.
---
Ohhhhh I like, ty!

We are a mature group with a lot of history in the game. We intend to progress consistently and quickly without requiring anyone to sink endless hours into raiding.

---
How to join
---
I got to level 20 or something without even having a pet. I dueled some guy, horribly lost, and he asked why I didn't have a pet. What?
---
See, the problem was that I was a night elf who ran to Elwynn to level, and so I skipped my class quest at level 10 because it would've sent me back to Dolanaar and I didn't realize how important it was.
---
Like explained above: sheep, cast fireball, pom, pyro, and one other instant fire spell, 3 dmg spells in the face when target cannot do anything
---
.. But i remember some guys can resist sheep, that was the sad part.
---
Yep. Esfand realised he wasn't gonna do any damage no matter what he specced so he just focused on buffs and utility
---
Can't wait for luna unit frames.
---
You have use to use aimed shot and multishot between autoshots. Most hunters download an addon which tracks their auto shot cooldown so they can avoid clipping it with abilities.
---
One is objectively stronger, it's called mage, more people do play it. This sub is really clueless when it comes to pvp.
---
What is the single best talent point that is available at level 10 across all the classes
---
As a toss in, Humans 10% spirit in a long fight averages out to about the same DPS as a Gnome. If you run out of mana and have to wand for a bit, they get about \~5 more mana regen per tick over Gnomes, in a 7-8 minute fight that averages out to an extra 5-6 Frostbolts which makes up for the \~0.4% crit chance from Gnomes 10% intellect.
---
So where is Kings Landing?
---
Yeah, makes no sense on wheelchairs
---
addons were a part of vanilla, are you mad that people can use addons?
---
Then they should content gate the TP stuff IMO.
---
Are you certain? patchwerk went berserk below 30% so if you didnt have the damage he would eventually kill the tanks and the raid.  
---
I recall there being many 1% wipe screenshots of it... or maybe my memory is biased because on my original realm the best guild managed to kill him by almost wiping at 1%, the sheer amount of players (40) allowed them to manage killing him before he killed them.
---
cute one of sages friends coming to defend his honor.  
---
https://www.twitch.tv/sage_on_twitch/following
---
Esfand literally saved the whole run with his emergency heals to let gachi (the priest) recover mp5, and his clutch lay on hands when they were about to wipe
---
His blessings helped asmon keep threat, the healer regain mana, and the hunters deal dps
---
Ty!
---
What server are you playing that isn't dead and actually has a functional auction house?
---
8.x, just ask anyone who's in the beta and they'll confirm it.
---
They were wearing cloth spell damage or arcane damage gear even [back in 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20060518025241/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-hunter&amp;T=985727&amp;P=1).
---
Stress test is probably your only option to login and actually edit the UI. 
---
But I would just ask: is it really that necessary to worry about custom action bars and party/unit frames when you're under level 10 or 20? You have 2 or 3 spells and maybe you'd be in a 5 man party at most. I'm not trying to criticize or anything, but I think you're creating a problem that isn't there.
---
You can also be one shot by hunters in BGs even if you have tier 2 as a mage. Aimed shot can crit for 3k and a auto shot crit and be 800-1100 damage. Most Mages have like 3400 hp in vanilla.
---
Yes and i'm still in ancient heroes 
---
played as Tiko
---
Figured as much.
---
I dont play BFA tho, 91 days and 17 hours is a long time to wait. Fuck.
---
Most people playing the beta are not streamers.
---
6 buttons might be something I could handle tht
---
Actually there was a pserver tourney for a lot of the best players a few weeks ago and the winning team ran a PoM Pyro Mage.
---
nice,  6 of my old guild registered on that website
---
+Spell damage works on both Arcane and Nature abilities though, +Arcane damage is easier to gear for but +Spell damage is more useful (and sometimes you don't even have a choice, like how you can enchant your weps with +spell damage but not +arcane).
---
I remember back in TBC, me and my best friend had level 19 twinks (I was undead rogue he was a Belf pally).
---
We are in Stonetalon mountains getting to level 19, we had all our enchanted gear, we were ready.
---
Next thing a level ?? Human warlock rolls up on her mount (so at least level 40+) and starts killing the horde NPC’s and quest givers. I was excited to slay noobs in a BG so I suggest to my friend going back to Org and queuing for WSG. My friend however, said no. 
---
He was the more experienced of us and had been playing since launch, I started a month before burning crusade came out. 
---
I distinctly remember him giving a speech in party chat and telling me to stealth up and make the move. Between 2 lvl 19 twinks we absolutely wrecked this warlock, we were both untouched. We proceeded to camp her body for the next hour, being 12/13 year old kids with nothing better to do. We ganked her over and over, in the end she only killed me once, and didn’t manage to kill my mate.
---
We still talk about it to this day at 24/25 hahah
---
there are like 0 queues once it gets later into the night I'm pretty sure, otherwise theres 1-2 wsg's going on during normal hours from what I've seen on streams
---
You can use it out of combat, but at 30 min CD, why would you?
---
Anything on female orcs or undead tbh.
---
Yeah that's what's keeping my hopes up, they've done more than well until now so we can hope they adress those issues! They must be working pretty hard and I think they'll communicate within the next days
---
I wish . . That would hands down be my favorite class
---
It’s quite engaging. Lots of death and running back to your corpse.
---
You played mage right? Haha long time so forgive me if i dont recall all the names, i played a dwarf hunter namned Nicanor if that rings any bells. Its awesome to hear that the guild is still up and running!
---
Dude that's an Airbus, it will automate everything and will prevent you from doing stupid shit!
---
Either join a guild and ask the pvpers to run through their play style, or read some guides and look out for what you've read so you understand it.
---
Haven't heard of any "so you play x? Here's all the other classes as they apply to you" guides.
---
You're asking for some deep-divey information but don't want to read deep dives, so I'd recommend getting comfortable skimming class guides instead of looking for the perfect level of detail on all the other classes.
---
Very good story. You hit on some of the key things it takes to be successful in any business no matter what it is and that is being resourceful along with risk taking. Resourcefulness is the ultimate resource. Well done and very inspiring.
---
Nobody is forgetting that. Linen is everywhere in starting zones.
---
Iirc spell dmg doesnt really help hunter but arcane dmg does but w/e. Nature dmg is not that good as scaling on serpent sting is meh
---
Sniffing them wouldn't even be weird anything - her husband is dead, and people (especially women) experiencing grief will frequently smells objects (especially clothing) of their loved one to remind them of that person - smell triggers memories far more than any other sense.
---
People will frequently do this after a breakup too, or if their significant other is on a long trip - they will smell the clothes they left behind.
---
Anyway, like the other poster said, ahes sniffling from crying, not smelling the glove. But it wouldn't be weird if she did smell the glove.

# &lt;Tilted Gryphons&gt; [NA][A][PvE][Semi-Hardcore] EVENINGS EASTERN
---
Tilted Gryphons is a friendly guild which is looking for social and progression-oriented players in order to complete all the content in Classic, and have a rowdy good time doing it. We don't mind if you're new to Vanilla or played in 2005, we have room for everyone if they're willing to be a positive member of our community.
---
* Be one of the top raiding guilds on Alliance for our server!
---
* Be a welcoming and friendly environment that you WANT to play with every night.
---
* Clear all content as efficiently as we reasonably can.
---
* Have a dedicated PVP team past Phase 3 interested in getting titles for those who want them.
---
* Generate great content and wholesome memes.
---
* Emulate the Gryphon. Have a friendly attitude, don't be a dick, help the pride, but have drive and passion when called upon.
---
* For our raiders, the willingness to improve. Don't require previous experience, just the ability to better yourself and the raid!
---
* Be able to use Discord with push to talk if you're interested in being an endgame player.
---
We're thinking a 3 night raiding guild, likely weekends plus one or two. The days are not defined yet (we're going to wait a month or two for people to get their fall timetables for uni, work schedules, etc) but will be discussed together with the members.
---
**Interested? We want to hear from you! Join here to chat!** : [https://discord.gg/tFAee5h](https://discord.gg/tFAee5h)
---
Stamina and plate(or whatever highest armor type you can pick)
---
You seem triggered by how I know you can't play a game without help. Sorry about that!
---
&gt; everything was undead and we still had all these undead only spells and effects.
---
Actually, the 2 "Undead/Demon"-only spells (Exorcism and Holy Wrath) were changed in WotLK to be targetable on anyone. Exorcism was given a guaranteed crit against Undeads/Demons, and Holy Wrath was given a guaranteed stun against Undeads/Demons instead.
---
No thanks. pservers are inaccurate and i dont want to practice leveling... i prefer to enjoy it and knowing things in advance takes that away. :P
---
Granted i did level on both factions in retail vanilla but gotta understand its been a long time... infact its also been many years since i played on pservers aswell so im becoming more ignorant by the day in preparation for launch. (ᵔᴥᵔ)
---
These past few days have been long... i gotta start playing some games  to  forget classic for a while so time goes faster. :D
---
I leveled a mage and a warrior. Yah the mage is easier, no doubt, but the warrior isn't that bad. Level first aid, keep stocked on food, once you get to 40 things go a lot smoother, and that's  just the halfway point.
---
so much dmg output and little bit brainless, i like it.
---
also how you end up with a majority player base of retards.
---
Nothing you can do about it, addons developments have came a long way. No more looking up thottbot for quests, just follow the arrows and looking at map
---
So not true! You over pull your fault!
---
It was honestly insanely easy. Back then as much as I was hooked as hell on WoW, people didn't realize prioritize min/maxing and efficiency in MMOs. Yes there will always be a select few that in every generation do, but I feel like how games are played now it isn't even close to what it used to be. I used to just chill and play the game. Didn't care about hitting 60 asap or min/maxing until I hit the cap.
---
I was able to do that and raid to 4 horsemen while going to college and working 3 part time jobs to fund it. So even doing that while still having enough time to raid and farm what I needed.
---
With all this said, raids will most likely go a lot quicker now. It wont be so much about trying to figure out anything anymore and more trying to herd 40 cats together.
---
+46, which is country calling code for Sweden.
---
It's a pretty valid concern to have, wouldn't wanna ding 60 and realize that your servers pop is pretty much dead, with no way of transfering that character. :/
---
July 2020, oh man. Guess I'll have to invest more time.
---
I never said that. I didn’t even watch the vid. All I’m saying is rank 14 grind doesn’t actually require skill. I’m not saying all rank 14 players are unskilled. Just that it takes none to achieve.
---
Good tank weapon
---
And that title wasn’t added until world pre patch when achievements were.
---
No, she's crying.
---
Who cares if she sniffed it anyway? Her husband died and that was his glove, and she's about to give it to you. In that situation she would be just trying to remember him one last time.
---
not everyone is a streamer/youtuber
---
Nature's Grasp for Druids and Dueling / PvP or solo PvE.  
---
35% chance on hit to get off a free entangling roots.
---
Yeah Mage, i remember the name. Guild was active raiding into Legion but has become much quieter now.
---
 Husband and Wife looking for PvE progression guild.
---
 Guild **must** be..
---
*  **NA** region
---
*  **PvE Server** (**No PVP servers**, I don't care how PvE focused you are, the gank squads won't either.)
---
*  **DKP** (No pure Loot Council)
---
 We would **LIKE** a guild that is...
---
*  **Horde** (Though we do have experience on alliance side as well, we prefer Horde)
---
*  **Mature Community** (In attitudes, not necessarily age.  Not acting like sociopaths.)
---
*  **Semi-Hardcore Pace** (Something in a "Rag in first month" rather than "rag in first week!" or "rag in first phase")
---
  What we have to **offer**..
---
* **Open availability**  (We will make your raid times work for us.)
---
* **Genuine Vanilla hardcore raiding experience.** (Top 3 progression guild on Hyjal \~2005-2006)
---
* **Recent Vanilla experience on private servers.** (We just finished a stint on LH to sharpen muscle memory)
---
* **Decades of MMO experience** \- **\~1996-Present** 
---
* **Leadership experience** \- She ran a hardcore raiding guild in Everquest during the 72 man raiding era.  We have both filled multiple officer roles, such as raid leading, recruitment, and DKP tracking in WoW guilds. We are willing to accept officer or advisory positions within a guild, if a guild thinks our experience would be useful, but we're more than content with a position in the rank &amp; file. 
---
My wife is firm on maining a holy/disc priest.  I am more flexible and have experience raiding as Hunter, Mage, Warrior (Tank), and Druid (Heals), but am provisionally set a Hunter for launch.  If you think we'd be a good fit for your guild, or have any additional questions, please shoot me a private message
---
None taken.
---
There's room for every style to enjoy the game. The key is to recognize what gaming personality you are, be okay with it, and not envy and wish you could be doing it a different way.
---
Thomas the Dank Engine
---
It’s not just a non-min/maxing guild though. It’s any progression guild. Try being in a “casual-friendly” guild progressing through Vael. 
---
That guild is going to either break up, or splinter into try-hards who want to progress and those who won’t do any BWL until they can get carried months later.
---
I mean I’d be looking forward to my lvl 5 Druid with a bunch of gold.
---
How would anyone test this? There's no items that give weapon skill. You would have to test with only the +5 from racials and compare numbers using two warriors of difference races. Even then you cant really know how it works because.. Well you can only get +5
---
What about work..?
---
TBC saw significant changes to every class so you dont really have a choice if. Vanilla private servers will the only thing you can try that's even close to Classic Hunter.
---
That's what I'm thinking. I've revised his plan a bit:
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/xhSeIhR.png)
---
Luckily I'll be writing my thesis starting in August, so 2 weeks of break for playing classic wow according to the updated plan is easily possible for me. Will be great!
---
12.5 hours of sports in a year is like 2 minutes a day. Don't you think it's you who should be changing your habits?
---
nine out of eleven
---
mage potentially aswell
---
NA player, from East coast, looking for some fellers to level/play with. I've played since vanilla, plan to level pretty fast but also run all instances. Open to playing Horde or Alliance, since I really just want to meet friends (alot of my friends don't play wow). PvP server prefered. Plan to play priest lock or mage but honestly my mind has changed like 20 times so who knows lol. I'm a goofy guy, definitely dark sense of humor, always down to help others out and enjoy the experience. Definitely feel free to send a friend request or msg me. Thx!!

Battletag: redbach#1494

Discord: andydandy#9244
---
I bet people would port Pally Power for classic and it won't be that cancerous.
---
Just for the special prize of 399$
---
Thats really cool, didnt think i would find anyone from the guild so fast. Anyone else still playing from the vanilla days and you guys planning on playing classic?
---
Lmfao a fucking level 8 boar resisting 3 spells in a row too ez
---
Ah yes I enjoyed that one 2. Venruki seems one of the better wow personas. We sadly seem to have some poor ones 2 though. Was happy to see big ones like Jesse Cox have one
---
It's because they sucked. 
---
Soul link being a 30 second buff (altough 50% dmg split), death coil being 10 min cd without any horror effect, siphon life and conflagrate had 1.5 sec casting time,  conflagrate was a 20yrd spell,  dots lasted a very long time but barely did any dmg.
---
&gt;when its real power is the judge effect.
---
???
---
Judgement of Justice does absolutely nothing in PvP. I dont even have it on my bars in Vanilla.
---
Cute lol
---
Whenever I roll hoard I roll Troll. For me the best Troll combo is hunter, not only for the great animation but also for the stat justification for using [Ancient Bone Bow] over crossbows.
---
Hi, /u/Galkovski
---
I can confirm this.   I was 3-4 weeks late at the start of my server launch, was not the most active player and I still was the 3rd lvl 60 warlock of the realm.  I got conscripted into what would end up to become the leading horde guild of the server, just to banish elementals in Molton Core, (They only had 1 warlock at that point )  I had not even finished my attunements .  I didn;t ven know if I would like raiding, but the enxt 2 years would be the best gaming experience of my life, and we had a nice MC - Cthun  run, with a tiny bit of Naxx at the end.
---
EU PVP Alliance, looking to come in contact with a Scandinavian guild. Pm for a chat
---
Im glad you liked it dude!
---
Hunter DPS is just a rotation, it can be optimized, without steady shot etc, you aren't doing anything intricate. 
---
Warrior DPS has the nuance of being reactionary, just like you said, being mediocre is not that hard, but being great is...
---
Warlock pets, specifically in PVP have a much higher skill ceiling, with more utility spells etc.
---
Just because you are a hunter doesn't make them the HARDEST class to master. All classes have very high skill ceilings.
---
Thats a perfect plan. I might even play till 6:00 and sleep till 12:00 cus less people are on at night, less competition.
---
useless site with shit UI.
---
Actually the majority of people will level relatively slowly. Only minority will go as fast as possible.
---
But technically you could say majority because everyone will be leveling at their own pace so thats "as fast as possible" in their own way.
---
But if you meant using guides then thats only minority... most people wont be speedrunning leveling. :P
---
Regardless just like many speedruns it will be interesting to see who gets to 60 fastest in /played ofcourse, real life time doesnt matter considering noone is gonna make it there in one sitting.... unless they stay up 2-3  nights and thats unhealthy.
---
Even the legend himself Joana slept during his speedruns of real vanilla and he made it in 4 days 20 hours played, come classic hes gonna try to beat his old world record so that will be interesting to see from someone whos been practicing and making a guide for it for over a decade.
---
&gt;healing is about all shamans were good for in vanilla pve.  Wear intellect gear.  Press the heal button.  Drop totems a lot.  Bring water.
---
It depends. For 5man dungeons you are usually better off with a Hybrid DPS than pure DPS just because of how strong utility is in a 5man where you wont always have 6+ Resto shamans like in a raid.
---
Very obvious personal vendetta. You ok?
---
Warriors are the slowest, that doesn't mean they are the least fun or too slow to play.
---
By slowest, that means someone doing a speedrun to 60 would finish later, but if you grind to 60 from release you'll be at 60 before a lot of mages and hunters just cuz you're committed.
---
Warriors are also the strongest dps and tank class at 60 , and will prob be the most played class (warr or mage) so it's not like the slow leveling really matters, people just get hung up on stats and stuff like that
---
If any one *wants* to play warr, they shouldn't let a slightly slower leveling speed affect that.
---
Thank you
---
If so we'd play on NA without issues, having 120 ms isn't a big deal if you get the right server=)
---
Sometime i wish that threat couldn't be calculated by addons
---
It could force us to take care about it the whole fight, without being able to just check it. 
---
It was probably why we remember threat as a "challenge" during Vanilla, because we weren't all using ThreatMeter and it wasn't displayed natively like in BFA.
---
But, well, look like we don't want to deal with the few remaining challenges with ThreatMeter + DBM :(. I know it's optionnel but no one will bridle himself if available.
---
I’ve only assumed such things because they have said they want to be able to work on optimizations and security fixes for both classic and modern at the same times, which makes sense.
---
In fact when they could use the modern client to run the old data, that’s what gave them the green light to go forward. They don’t want to have to work on the two projects separately.
---
I found out about this website just last night, was super happy!!!
---
I've seen a shaman tank Chromaggus, fwiw, but that fight is almost uniquely suited for shamans.
---
Shamans' real problem is there is no mail armor with the necessary defensive stats.
---
early in TBC, a patch gave imps a stupid boost in dps, something with a variable being put wrong, like 3.1 instead of 1.3 or so.  In any case they could  machine gun anybody down with  their improved firebolts.   It was good fun, the two or so days it lasted before a hotfix :D
---
But then it would make the most sense to sleep between 16:00-22:00, wouldn't it? I don't think 06:00-12:00 is prime time, it might even be the most empty time? But you make a good point, maybe 16:00-22:00 is the perfect time to sleep. However, I'd be too scared of long queues at 22:00
---
I had a reputation in vanilla and BC for being the first to disappear in the event of a wipe.
---
Healer died? I bailed seemingly aeons ago because I had a premonition of failure.
---
Are there any resources that anyone knows about to develop stuff for nu-classic?   
---
Is it just using the updated API in its entirety?
---
Dammit. I was sure it was 12pm lunch time but seems you are right. Why can't they launch EU servers a bit later? Launch day is a special occasion so it sucks a bit that it's at midnight.
---
Lol where do you think Pally Power started
---
Im gonna give it a go, not sure about others as most are offline in the latest Xpac.
---
so basically the whole rotation (aside solo content) is based on autoshot, aimed shot and multishot (for aoe, more than 2 mobs) ?
---
Can you not read?
---
Holy/Prot Paly + 3 Hunters + Priest includes him, his buffs and CDs....
---
Lol
---
We lost billy into the void..
---
 *A* **hunter** *is a fast leveling class. If you are playing an average of* **50 hours per week** *and your leveling speed is* **fast** *you will probably ding level 60 somewhere around...*
---
***Thursday 26 September 2019***
---
This is exactly my target, ding 60 within a month :-)
---
Who said they couldn't be excited? Don't misunderstand my post.
---
It did but boy was it worth it
---
I work 3 12s, so I get 4 days off  each week so ha!
---
Mate, you are 91 days too early. :(

You can see about as much as you could on those UIs back in the day where the lower third of the screen is just covered by a black bar.

I just need enough gear to annoy people in pvp.. [cuz it's fun!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxi5wzmPRA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=160)
---
Probably not on classic demo after BlizzCon.
---
It’s not supposed to be 1-2% like pservers.
---
Weapon skill gives a static .04% per weapon skill. So 5 weapon skill gives .2% hit.
---
Bro how can you not love fem undead? When they run each booty cheek slides into an opposite plane of existence
---
Heh only 11? damn, i was 15 and an idiot... got kicked from my  guild for begging gold. Thats not something im proud of... but i did manage to clear MC before it happened. :3
---
WC staff/sword will be BIS for horde
---
They were working in Vanilla, so they'll be back. The thing is, about add-ons, you don't have to use it if you don't want to!
---
Made it to the Ironforge airport in stress test, can share pictures later if you want.
---
I was topping damage meters as a warlock on multiple private servers, MC and BWL. Unless it was a melee friendly fight which most are. Would still be the top of the caster dps. It's all about knowing how to gear and maximizing your shadow bolt casts.
---
Gnome is the best for pvp and pve.
---
Tert and Yortail were online in the last day, from the roster i can see Juzzam, Fox, Altariel in the last month or so, so its very quiet now
---
And then 4k at max level to be able to justify buying epic riding

I've spent the last few months making tons of vanilla WoW wallpaper engine recordings. From Durotar to Naxxramas, I've scoured all of vanilla WoW for scenic and memorable places to put on our desktops, including some secret areas such as GM Island and Azshara Crater.
---
They're all recorded, edited to make as seamless a loop as possible, then optimized to reduce filesize without sacrificing the visual quality. All wallpapers are in 1920 x 1080.
---
If you wish to see an example of one such wallpaper in action, you can see Mazzranache here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehnYrQM\_jp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehnYrQM_jp4)

Well yes.

Gnome mage &gt; human mage

But that wasnt the question. I just picked hunter.

Fedex fifty-one-charlie, descend and maintain flight level three-twenty.

Control, that's a negative. I'm engaged with Ragnaros right now.

layering
---
This guide is a bit on the slow side if you ask me. Most people will finish the 1-60 journey in about 10 days /played. The fastest will do it in less than 8 days.
---
Hunter was in fact designed to make pulls in dungeons. Pull &gt; feint, pull &gt; trap, etc... Handy when you have a paladin tanking for example.
---
fine thankyou.  Not a personal vendetta.
---
 1. fix the credits to the other contributors no matter how small, make it clearly visible and clear.
---
2. fix the guide its self and actually test it on a repack and record it. I am open to even assisting with this should it be needed.
---
ok retard
---
If you ever have any questions in the future, hit me up! 
---
I’ll gladly answer any question any time, I don’t care how trivial lol
---
I see a lot of you can only heal in dungeons as a ele shaman but not raids. Understand that though you will be inefficient, you can still DPS in a raid. We have an ele shaman that raids with us on a private server I play on. He just buys the Mana flask before raid and he does fine.
---
Leashing exists for all mobs. They leash after a certain distance, but that distance resets every time they are hit with a spell or attack (dot ticks do not reset, but the initial cast does).
---
Yea I agree. 
---
On lolprivate servers both Rogues and Paladins are generally considered to be worse at leveling than Warriors when played by a skilled player. They are both relegated to melee only but once Warriors get to 40 they can Hamstring kite mobs and significantly reduce the amount of damage they take, and thus the downtime between pulls. Rogues and Pallys don't have that luxury and Pallys also have to deal with mana as well.
---
You are right but they are **essential** now that's the "issue". 
---
If you raid without DBM+KTM you may do it once but now twice players won't allow it. 
---
For me dealing with threat + boss mechanics timing is part of the game. Thoses addons allow you to litteraly skip this part of the challenge :(
---
You're absolutely right, doing sports could lead to breaking your hand which would be awful if you want to play WoW... That's why I'm not doing any sports at all since they announced WoW Classic.
---
it's also possible they are being more harsh than they normally would since its beta
---
Sleep from 17:00 till 0:00
---
u might be right, gotta reset my mindsets for classic :x
---
Greater blessings came out before 1.12 didn't they?  So instead of 40x 5 min, it's really like 8x 15 min.  Honestly not bad at all.  Especially if pallypower gets ported.
---
I think it was most people didn't know how to play warlocks. My first toon was a warlock, and I honestly thought they sucked, but looking back it was just that I was horrible and had no clue on how to play. Now I'm wondering if I should go back to lock for classic.
---
**Pure guesses:**  
---
Hand of Ragnaros: Paladin/Ret, sometimes warrior
---
Thunderfury: Main tank warrior, offtank warrior  
---
Atiesh: Long term dedicated caster class  
---
AQ Mount: Guild leader or an officer almost every time  
---
Other mounts: Open roll
---
You can still one shot people with windfury, just need slightly better RNG. A strong 2 hander and getting a windfury proc where the attacks crit is still capable of insane burst.
---
It reminds me of how infants will be excited and happy when they see people clapping and going "yaay!" even when they don't understand what's going on.
---
Omg it has felt like 17 years.
---
Absolutely this. I played on a TBC private server where the procrates of weapons and certain set bonuses was tuned through the roof. I was a rogue wearing Warglaives with 4 pieces of Darkmantle because the procrate was so utterly insane that it didn't matter that I was dropping about 100 item levels on my bracers, belt, boots, and gloves.
---
Awesome vid man. Thanks - subbed
---
Sheep, pyro, counterspell, fireball, pom pyro, fireblast is better
---
Now I understand why I felt so drawn to be a Hunter
---
Small group of players looking for a guild on a PVP server (flexible on faction since no one wants to main shaman/paladin) that raids EST on weeknights (weekend raiding is also great!). Our group has a hpriest 3-4 ranged dps (warlock/mage/hunter mix) a rogue and I plan to tank (Whether as a prot warrior or a feral flex slot). My gaming history:
---
I was pretty casual in Classic, I played a fury warrior and a priest and did some raiding but nothing of note.
---
In TBC my guild killed M'uru (The guildslayer) and broke shortly after. I was playing hunter and then mained my prot warrior in a black temple level guild after that happened. The most fun I had the entire xpac was putting my fury gearset on my prot warrior and spamming devastate on gorefiend and doing WAY more dps than I thought it would.
---
In WoTLK I rolled a DK on my friends pvp server (bleeding hollow) and was the top DK tank (maybe just tank in general) on the server for most of Wrath (There was a couple patches that made DK tanking basically not worth the effort). Obtained a 10/25 man immortal title in 25 naxx  (The only group on the server to obtain the 25man in era).
---
In Cata-bfa my group of friends basically did the same thing every xpac and would come back for 2-3 weeks to see if this xpac was better and then we'd be disappointed with retail wow and quit.
---
Most of us are taking that first week off to level (although some of us can't and will likely be slower) and are looking for a guild that plans to start raiding around 4 weeks after launch. Looking for a guild that's serious about raiding but not hardcore as most of us are working professionals.
---
I don't know where this alleged "fact" comes from but it's almost entirely just a case of developer error, not intentional overtuning. Many mobs are UNDERTUNED on private servers as well (Nostalrius for example had a ton of mobs with 0 armor so melee classes just tore through them).
---
&lt;Adventures and Consequences&gt;
---
North American Alliance
---
West Coast / PvE Realm
---
About us: &lt;Adventures and Consequences&gt; is going to be a casual PvE guild, we're recruiting players just to have an awesome time with WoW Classic and casually progress through content.
---
There will not be any sourt of pressure to reach max level, we all have lives that come first and will be the priority. The raids we do will likely be half pugged.
---
We're coming to this game to have a great time and try to pursue loot without destroying our lives. That being said, this will
---
be a mature guild, under 18s are allowed but must understand that we won't heavily censor ourselves around them (Though harrassment isn't acceptable).
---
PvP focused players are welcome to gather here, though the leadership isn't planning on focusing on PvP much more than the occasional BG.
---
There is not currently a set raid schedule but end of week (Wed-Fri) is the most likely direction we will take this in with maybe a pickup on Sunday or Monday, the leadership is based in the west coast region of the United States.
---
If you'd like to find out more feel free to DM me, Discord is Takerofsoles#2742. I check discord a lot more frequently than reddit. There isn't any formal application process but I would like to just speak to you before I hand out invites to the Discord server.
---
I picked my class because my rl friend told me warlock was the least played class when i started.
---
Yeah thunderfury to MT/OT, sulfuras to PvP ret pallies, Atiesh to me because I'm the guildmaster hehehe. Oh and also the red qiraji mount is officer prio. The ZG mounts are just free roll. I won't roll on them because I just love my warlock mount.
---
same! I dream about wow, I haven't felt this way about gaming in like a decade.
---
Rather that than one button rotation to be frank ...
---
You're going enter a harsh and unforgiving world.  The determined will reap ultimate power.
---
The rogue trinket is pretty op too. The priest trinket is extremely good as well.
---
I mean, how will that be significantly different from real life?
---
I'm none of these things, what the hell am I supposed to play?!
---
Thanks /u/null-case for the feedback. I have put that at the top of my todo list.
---
I am learning Vue/NUXT as I go with this project as well as Firebase. Some things still need to be researched and added.
---
preservation is important.
---
[there you go](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#RMzc0zJ89cVVooo9m8cM1808c0X87czaF87kMia808VFA808MSx808cZc87V)
---
to be honest id rather try female troll or tauren
---
That sounds like the perfect combo, thanks.
---
Gotta agree with Holy here. Almost no one was in a primary role spec while leveling and even most 60s farming dungeons won't be for a long long time. The only exception of this is people raiding, which most likely wont care to run dungeons anyway outside of farming orbs and stuff.
---
Almost every dungeon group is going to be leveling specs or if all 60s then farming specs. It was expensive to respect so people didn't exactly do it prior to running content outside of raiding or focused pvp. Unless you raided a lot, 9 time out of 10 everyone is in some sort of farming spec.
---
Its cause of bloodrage, since its turning hp into rage or whatever. You could just use bloodrage and you'd have the same thing happen as in the clip
---
Outplayed. 😏
---
Good luck clearing WC.
---
The whole point of Classic is to provide Players with a game that is frozen at a snapshot in time (patch 1.12). 
---
People who want changes/improvements/updates should play Retail WOW.
---
Links should open in a new tab. What platform are you viewing on? I will check into it.
---
As for the resume where you left off, that is being worked on right now.
---
Thank you for the feedback!

So you want to manage a guild bank using bank alts and spreadsheets?

I appreciate your help, I now realize my phrasing was rude. I just mean that the notation is weird for us who dont use it.

"Slowing down invites" simply means "we stopped inviting people but if you are stupid enough to resub to try to get invited, by all means please send us that $15".

I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me. Could you be more specific?

Thank you for your feedback. :-/
---
They actually said they are not sure if they will carry over or not yet and will be deciding in the next week. Blue post and everything. That would not be fair. I agree.
---
Becsuse its a small closed beta and thr bugs were already discovered
---
Just blink out of the stun and you're golden.
---
Yet we are getting slight improvements (UI) despite the no changes loudmouths shouting down everyone else.
---
I’m dying lmao.
---
Like, it's cool and all to do this on live servers imo. But what a waste of keys for those who actually want to test stuff and play the actual beta. I am not mad or anything. I just think it's not a rly fair use of a beta access. Just my 0.02$.
---
Good meme. If you're dying to mobs that much then you're overextending yourself.
---
Faster
---
Not everyone feels that way. I'm all for QoL changes that don't take away from the immersion or challenge of classic. I firmly believe this falls under that category.
---
That's probably a good idea. But for an expansion. There will only be an expansion if classic is popular enough to justify it.
---
whooooshed
---
😂😂😂
---
Why TF would he stealth when wearing flag?
---
Why do you think it needs to be only in an expansion?
---
Lucky for you, you dont have to play classic! We will all miss you, that's for sure.

---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---

UI change doesn’t change certain mechanics in the game tbh.. other than that, don’t they have like a box which you can tick if you want classic UI?
---
I don’t even know what UI changes you’re talking about
---
You're gonna get snagged on low drop rate quests (like "collect 10 bear asses from the predominantly assless bears") but make up time on quests like "kill 20 bears. No I don't need anything from them" because you'll have 3 people tagging instead of 1.
---
You'll get grinding experience split among you, but should, on the whole, quest faster. Probably net neutral to slightly faster to level in a group, *especially* if you have better group levelers (warrior, priest, paladin). If you're going as Hunter Warlock and Mage, a lot of the leveling benefits of those classes is diminished in groups.
---
Constantly popping greater stoneshield potions
---
Not so much kinky, as it's simply enough just Sweden's country code when you need to call a person located in Sweden haha
---
I think it depends on your group. I tried leveling with a friend during vanilla and he ended up slowing me down. I leveled 4 60’s back then and my fastest was solo. You can just run from quest to quest without waiting for everyone.
---
We will most likely have realm transfers
---
Sounds good. Lets hope we are efficient enough to get ahead of the mass
---
Had a metal one with velcro on the bottom. I think the only other game I linked it to was a fighting game. 3-step Hadouken!
---
Serendepitys really isnt that good of a player. Got kicked from all good guilds on private servers and latched onto Soda to pretend to be this big boy vanilla god. Cringe listening to him give advice.
---
Moving frames, auto loot by default, new raid frames. I've seen the no changes crowd bitching about these minor things as well.
---
You're trying to make classic wow a better game.  And that's beside the point. It has to be faulty unbalanced to spark creativity in players. Using self made solution (i e spreadsheets). If the game babysits everyone into just making it better it's like video game luxury. Where is the struggle? The thing that motivates players. It just has to be the way it was for people to remember what it was to play a masterpiece with all its faults and wrongs.
---
Will take me longer too cause Im playing as rogue. Oh well, will just enjoy the leveling and catch up later.
---
Go away.
---
Be constructive.
---
I respect your opinion. That being said....
---
This sounds like the standard reply of a person who doesn’t want to play the game for what it is, rather, wants everything to be obvious and handed to him. You practically said that throughout your response. It’s just an entitlement thing. “I want this thing this way, and I want it now.”
---
Those of us who like vanilla, enjoyed the reward and savored the journey.
---
Yep pretty much.
---
You always use multishot unless there is a cc’d target nearby that you don’t want to break. It punches really hard is always a dps increase. There are talents and tier pieces that increase its damage as well.
---
A setup in to aimed shot, auto shot, multishot is a shitton of burst and can be really satisfying in pvp.
---
This is fucking awesome
---
Mage and warrior are the strongest against rogues. Well and lock with soul link but that's another story.
---
Agreed. We need to get rid of all the click-to-play elements before launch as it doesn't belong in vanilla whatsoever.
---
Assess from assless bears had me giggle.
---
Thats also what i thought, thanks for confirming
---
Doubtful, as they have always been an integral part of the game from day 1. But you could just not install addons and enjoy a raw experience for yourself. What's keeping you from it?
---
That's racist
---
Agreed. Exaggerated af. Sure it isn't a joke like a hunter, lock, shadowpriest.... But haven't had a single problem.
---
Hamstring method with swing timer = GG. Learn thrown weapons and/or learn to body pull.
---
&gt; Is it bad that I read procrates with [the same sort of phonetics as "Socrates"](https://youtu.be/8XJKUITfiv4?t=32)
---
Sounds perfect.
---
I will be playing warrior and I can only play on weekends. I will hit 60 on April 2020 QQ

What is the meaning of this intrusion?!

We're looking to fill one 40 man raiding group and host one active premade PvP group. Hope to see you in Classic!
---
He got it from starting zone spider mob. There was a screenshot of it couple days ago..
---
Yeah but let’s be honest pre lvl 30 overextending yourself on a warrior can literally mean pulling one extra mob or no extra mobs and just bad luck on swings. One too many misses and you die from a same level mob.
---
I can remember the first person I knew who got 60 had 40 days /played at that point!
---
I see your point, but while most other similar issues are solved/improved with addons this one has no solution but to give a few players in each guild an enormous and boring burden.
---
I don’t mind the difficulty of grinding elementals/herbs/building my own UI/timing my cooldowns/learning rotations/building our own DKP system/managing player loot drama...but I think the number of people who will actually enjoy this particular one is very low.
---
Faster. While some quests will take longer (low drop chance) others will be faster. The main benefit is that all non-elite quests will be a cake walk. Dying shouldn’t really occur so you’ll save time there and forming groups will be fast. 
---
If you end up grinding mobs, based on data from level 1-5 - it may be better to grind on mobs 2 levels lower than you. You’ll kill them very fast and they reward 60%~ of the exp you would get killing them solo. 
---
Consistent duo or trio levelling will be first to 60 if you put in the same amount of hours.
---
Wasnt really rude at all, my response and the other one contradicted eachother lmao
---
Right
---
Like rightclick reporting, loot trading, layering, higher pop cap, WOD client, battlenet, 6 patches instead of 12 etc.
---
Totally frozen snapshot, having guildbanks would completely ruin the intense integrity of classic wow
---
This. You don’t have to “rush”. You can play the game how you want.
---
I feel like you may want to include 5/5 Fel Concentration in this build as well

Develop a core team to enjoy classic leveling / raiding with.

Our primary goal is having fun with the game.

Jurisnoctis, Horde, Raiding, NA (East Coast)
---
Hello, I'm Jurisnoctis. Horde. PvP or PvE server is fine.
---
I'm into raiding/progression, used to be a raid leader and officer, and, I just don't have the time to do that.
---
I'd like to join a serious guild that wants to get stuff downed. I know srs bsns attracts edgy asshats, so I'd also like to join a mature guild for a smooth time.
---
I can help in all raiding aspects, or not. I'm not power hungry, and just being asked to top DPS meters or heal properly (with wand attacks in between for christ's sake!) is A-OK with me, but just also fyi you _could_ lean on me for coordination/organization if you need/want.
---
True but 1.12 itemization/talents doesn't really mean much on the classic beta difficulty. Those things aren't noticable at all until level 60.
---
Get intercepted and die. Pvp isnt as easy as naming 3 abilities and saying win.
---
On vacation for one week.
---
thank you for clarifying this. happy to see that both classic and live lightnings are restored properly.
---
now all it needs is the alternate death effect in both classic and live https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs1gw2/preserving_the_death_effect_2/
---
That UI is trash.
---
Haha, remember this guy from my server, Al'akir (eu). He was like royalty. Had some great pvpers back then and going into tbc. Hworang, Inflame etc.
---
i am as you tornapart between orc and undead
---
Add-ons are the part of classic I'm least excited for.
---
How is 1.12 pserver relevant to early vanilla?
---
What if it was actually under his right hand?
---
To sap him...
---
On the other hand what is that other 75% doing just sitting on its ass in my bag? Get out there and make me some mother fucking money.
---
That’s definitely the bit I’m most envious of, this stuff is so cool to watch.
---
More like stuck autorunning into a tree trying to get back to your corpse.
---
Unless you run out of reagents mid raid and have to do it manually again lol
---
I don't really know much about add-ons, but anyone know if there is one that will be able to make your hotbar area like how it is in retail? I don't want to use elvui or another hotbar addon, but I'd much rather prefer the "layout" in bfa compared to the classic one.
---
They send you an email
---
I used a UK website so the website I used was probably just a rip off. Will have a proper search after work
---
I remember pre-raid guild runs specifically to try and get Fury Warriors that trinket... full clears became clockwork
---
That..... that's it....?
---
What is pvp
---
since it looks like we wont get an rp-pvp realm i reckon the community will choose one itslf, a pvp realm, and declare it an rp hub and some rp guilds settle there, at least i hope so. i will make my decision a few weeks/days before release closely monitoring reddit/forums
---
For those who can't read the footnote:  
---
"Calculations are obviously **a raw estimate** and are more meant as an indicator than an actual fact. Rested XP bonus has not been taken into consideration.  
---
Class leveling time multipliers currently are: warrior (1.3x - slowest), paladin (1.25x), shaman (1.2x), rogue (1.2x), warlock (1.1x), mage (1.1x), druid (1.05x), hunter (1x - fastest). These are an estimation (there is no real data available) and can still change. On average a slow player will take about 18 days to level to 60, a normal player 14 days and a fast player 10 days." And Joana 4.20 days.
---
Thank you very much for your effort :D &lt;3 that C'thun one
---
Wow, he's unbearable. How can anybody watch someone who's bellowing at the top of his lungs into the mic?
---
Popularity/player count for an expansion doesn't always equate to to how good it was. WOTLK had the highest player count because it came in off the back of TBC's success and had the most beloved character/storyline in the warcraft universe. The player growth instantly leveled out after the release and began to decline from there on. A good game doesn't just stop growing overnight like that.  
---
By today's standards, looking back we can say that WOTLK was a pretty good expansion but that's only when comparing it to shit like MOP, WOD, Legion, BFA etc. If you compare it to Vanilla and BC then it's pretty mediocre and was the start of the negative direction that the developers started to take the game in (accessibility creep, LFG, easier content).
---
Sulfuros - DKP on first binding shard drop. 
---
TF - Main tank.
---
Atiesh-You're not going to get it.
---
Scarab Mounts - Free roll (once you have one, you can't get another one). If there's a huge want, can use DKP on red ones.
---
you don't get beta access if you don't have sub so don't worry.
---
Well, testing has also shown that mobs out in the world are generally tougher on classic beta than on the big private servers (the nost core ones). 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR0fT3Hz3M&amp;t=1s
---
Elite trash in dungeons like DM though have been shown to do higher damage on private servers. But it goes both ways, some things are harder on classic too.
---
That doesn't work. What I love about the original game is to explore the world doing quest without any marking or anything, and grouping with random people that I find to go adventuring around. Happens that if 99% of the people use add-ons and know exactly where the quest are and even the timers, when I group with anybody it breaks my "game-experience". That without taking into account that everyone has a huge advantage against you, including the other faction.
---
There is an add-on that moves your chat input bar from the bottom of the box to the top of the box. This is a cheat?
---
Well auto loot? You mean Mass loot right? That definitely Alters the gameplay, though not to a noticeable degree. I’d actually like that change lol
---
New raid frames are nice too tbh
---
OR, you can play on a PvP server where you don't have to deal with pyschopaths who enjoy causing others pain.
---
This is Classic.
---
I'm gonna guess op wants to be competitive while using the standard ui but if others use an add on they will have an easier time of it so he won't be able to compete with with them as effectively
---
My class choice as a kid predicted my entire personality
---
Which was my point; it'll be one of the perks of vanilla; actual hatespeech won't be allowed :).
---
Hunter &gt; Druid/Wl &gt; rest
---
You can just die and res inside, Asmon took like 40 people in last week.
---
Indeed.
---
Keybind theory is often never touched on but there are plenty of guides out there that dont even need to be vanilla specific. What helped me playing a shaman on a server was "logically" binding everything. For example.  ( y = mana stream, ctrl y = mana tide, shift y = poison cleansing, 1 = earth shock, shift 1 = earth shock rank one, g = grounding totem, shift g = windfury, ctrl g = grace of air. 
---
Shamans have a shit ton of buttons.
---
Its almost like both of you need to take a break and let your autism cool down.
---
Typical mage behavior.. oy vey /s
---
You're right. In those cases you'll probably have to reset before it's too late. It won't always be successful, but most of the time you should be able to escape death.
---
Fair enough ;)
---
You about ready to come yet? You're stroking your own epeen pretty hard there.
---
Oh well that's a normal amount I guess. Wonder who's going Beta first Rank 6 (or whatever the cap for lvl 30's are).
---
I've never tried this method, but it may be worth it to consider what role you are playing. I generally play healers with an addon that necessitates clicking on (Grid, Healbot, etc.). I prefer just using A and D to strafe. It really isn't hard at all to navigate without keyboard turning, and clicking to strafe sounds like a great way to miss out on heals.
---
The first generation of players in vanilla consisted almost exclusively of people from EQ, DAoC and other early MMORPGs.
---
i remember back in vanilla closed beta when they released Windfury as a skill it was like " chance on hit to gain **7** extra Attacks" 
---
that got changed pretty fast though :D
---
I bet haha. Thank you kind sir!
---
Tusks or horns or open bones might be an extra turn-off but ye
---
Yep, I already knew they didn't. Was just posting this because hundreds of people were wrong in Asmongold's chat, saying they did.
---
Retards that you can farm HK's from.
---
I think your tool is pretty accurate for me at least. I play 7-8 hours a day and need about a month to hit 60 on Pservers.
---
No, I mean being able to auto loot without holding Shift. I've seen people complaining about that since it's a "change"
---
Was it Burning Crusade where Paladins would need spell power 1H swords / maces? And the better geared ones would have to start getting naked during heroics so they could actually take enough damage to regenerate mana?
---
Christ, as much as i'm looking forward to Classic the thought of them also opening BC and Wrath servers on the side makes me genuinely moist... the best expansions
---
The addon’s creator has already said he’ll be working on a Classic version. That said, I honestly don’t know how conducive Classic is to a controller. I think there’s more abilities in Classic than retail so it’ll be hard to map everything to so few buttons.
---
You know exactly what I mean, don't come to do stupid statements, please.
---
Hunter is a hard ass to raid on, 2-3 max per raid. Scales poorly after BWL. Human mage is a huge mistake over Gnome mage.
---
Sure thing bud, enjoy those low tier premades not that it affects me in any negative way. The less people listen to me the easier it is to win.
---
Why does it break your game experience if others use add-ons and obviously your going to be at a disadvantage if you don't use add-ons but why should you care if you are looking specifically for a "game experience" if others choose to be more competitive.
---
 **&lt;Legacy&gt; | US PVE| Alliance | NA |**
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
**Who do we want?**
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
**What roles are in current demand?**
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for dps warriors/rogues/mages at the moment
---
**Misc:**
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
* Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even  
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
* World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
* Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
**How to join?**
---
https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK  
---
 , we are still in the process of setting up appropriate tabs. Feel free to ask any questions/contact us either in discord or through this post.
---
And gnome is objectively better than human for mage
---
 Wednesday and Thursday are another stress test isn't it? No invites went out during the  last stress test.
---
So what's the difference between the pally and lock personalities?
---
Lvled 3 warriors as prot from lvl 10. It truly ISNT as bad as people think. I was prot, cuz i love tanking 5 mans when i lvl, but even doing quests isnt that bad.
---
You engage your target, alt tab, check /r/classicwow , your mail, fav social media, tab back, and the mob is dead, while you still have 85% hp. Exelent for watching movies/series :D
---
Both
---
https://www.geekifyinc.com/product/custom-game-cloth-map-rpg-gaming-printing-service/
---
That's what I used - not sure if they ship to the UK but there may be hope!
---
I think it is exaggerated, but warrior is a very tough leveling experience if it's a noob playing. Not too bad with current knowledge and a bit of try-harding.
---
When did they make it seem like everyone gets in? They've tempered expectations from the start, reiterating it's a small closed beta.
---
Ah OK, I see. I agree. Both matchups are winnable, but it's certainly an uphill battle for rogues.
---
I haven't seen it here yet, but remember that F1-5 are viable bind options as well. Great for pets, marking targets, or offensive spells that you aren't always using. Some keyboards accommodate those binds better than others though.
---
I agree, it was a little on the slow side because i was (also) looking at the average leveling times back in Vanilla Wow. However, these are not really realistic anymore since most people playing WoW Classic will know the game a lot better and level up faster.   
---
So.. i changed the figures now to:
---
* fast: 8 days
---
* normal: 12 days
---
* slow: 17 days
---
We’re only testing 10% of the game and it has a good amount of bugs.
---
kill quests will be quicker but low drop rate items you will be slower.
---
Lul, owned by orc racial and playing a shit spec.
---
God I miss G4TV
---
You mean like "addons are cheating"? cause that's a real stupid statement.
---
And thank you for reading! From what I've seen recently, classic devs have been really active with reading submitted bugs on subreddit, so I have high hopes they'll fix all of that before release
---
Plan to use a combo of council and SK. Most items will be distributed as normal using SK but patterns (first drop), tanking and healing gear will be handed to the person the council views as needing it and most helpful to the raid. Can't go very far without well rounded tanks and healers.
---
Legendary items:
---
TF = tanks
---
Sulf = whoever wants it, and will build it themselves. Most likely a druid, pally or shammy. Doesn't serve alot of purpose for the guild
---
Eitesh? Pretty far off, but most likely someone who's been working with the progress of the guild the entire time and would see a benefit from it. Or the RL's girl/boyfriend.
---
Mounts always open roll.
---
When i first tried playing I rolled a dwarf and made it to Ironforge. My computer then decided it was NOT AT ALL prepared for that. I had to have my friend who introduced me to the game come over and hearthstone me out
---
Don’t make stupid posts then. This is asked everyday and people have the same answer. 
---
Addons were/are gonna be part of classic wow wether you like it or not. People will use ones that make the game simpler for them and help with raiding.
---
I'm just getting triggered over some people's "muh I do sports every day for hours, even if I nolife in WoW and don't work and don't sleep I'm still going to spend hours on sports muhmuh".
---
When did they say that everyone could participate to Beta?
---
complete with bandicam watermark
---
There were 3 of those and about 300 actual bugs.
---
If you're bad.
---
Ugh no. Go fury til 40 then swap to arms if you plan on utilizing sweeping strikes / are on a pvp server.

#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
**Interested?**

Yep yep. Not sure if your friend told you though, but not everyone on F&amp;F will make it in.
---
I was added last Tuesday, told I would be in last Thursday, and am still not in yet. There is also a priority system. Since I'm the only one on my friends list, he says I should get "priority" but alas, still not in yet. If your friend has 3+ people your odds lessen of getting in
---
I think a lot of people are basing their opinions on retail's xpac beta's. I personally feel like way more people got into those and I assume that's what others think as well? I'm not sure but I'm just gonna sit here and wait till launch and just plan out what I'm going to do until then lol
---
how did you do that? With a census add-on or something? and this is from the beta?
---
&gt; he leaves combat ~6 seconds after bloodrage ends
---
Yes I noticed that but as I said I can't quite remember if this is correct. However if it is, then I guess this mystery has been solved.
---
Speak for yourself, bruh.  I was playing a Wizard in Ruins of Kunark a short while ago.  Project 1999
---
As long as you're not nerfing your own hit rate too much it's probably excellent damage. I can't remember; was SnD Combat or backstab spamming Assassination the best damage in vanilla? I remember seeing plenty of both, with Subtlety being the spec for PvP
---
Levelling with a healer friend basically reduces downtime and combat time greatly, but alone it is NOT a fun experience, especially on a PVP server where warriors struggle.
---
 "They advertised it like it was some kind of big event where everyone could partecipate and then they gave out some very little invites.  "
---
 Beginning May 15, select WoW players will be invited to participate in a small-scale, focused closed beta test. 
---
 [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) 
---
How did you get the impression that everyone would be able to participate?
---
you can reserver whatever you want but the rogue in your group will press need on it anyway.
---
Just changed this a bit for a more realistic leveling time:
---
* super-fast (joana-style): 4.5 days
---
* very slow: 21
---
It’s not surprising tbh
---
No, that's a reality and I didnt asked for your opinion.
---
y
---
I hate gnomes man. What would u suggest i play then?
---
\+windfury procc
---
If I'm vs an evenly matched warrior and I have all my cooldowns there's a good chance I win unless he dodges a stun in the opener or something then I'm in trouble. Mages have the advantage off the start because it's up to the rogue to do something, since you cant get a real opener on him.
---
Frost mage wouldn't be doing anything if there are casters in the pack.
---
Good luck :D
---
Looks, another retard. I'm not asking for your shit. What a trash community.
---
gona struggle on that,  the trinket requires 230 engineering to get 225+ you need to be lvl 35to learn artisan
---
Great no need for new laptop thanks!
---
I like the new plan, but doesn't 6 hrs of sleep each night seem . . Excessive?
---
Thunderfury to main tank, then other tanks (rarely rogue since third best wep in the game and BiS pvp, but that's the leaders best friend rogue).
---
Sulfuras to warriors for pvp, but the weapon sucks anyway so you either go for r14 wep or have better weapons later on. Feral druid with sulfuras is decent they'd get prio for it, then shaman/pala.
---
Atiesh, no one will get that and if you do then enjoy a weapon better than level 70 epics, there is no real priority here but usually it's the firemage who specs into ignite to boost his damage into ridiculous levels. Or Warlocks.
---
Mounts are open for roll, generally, but preference to day 1 guildmembers.
---
that's why most tanks refuse to take rogues to ironfoe runs _or_ use masterloot to distribute reserved items.
---
When Monks were first introduced I levelled one as a tank, spamming dungeons. I got both Ironfoe and Dragon's Call during the first run of each dungeon and I was absolutely *appalled* at my luck!
---
(They lasted until about lvl 62)
---
Its called will it classic. Not does it classic
---
whenever i read canvas i hear the voice of bob ross.
---
So just because there are some changes, any other changes can be justified with “we’ve already changed the game”?
---
On the contrary imo, that should only make us hold on tighter against unnecessary changes.
---
Because that's def comparable to finger dexterity lol... These pedals are useful though. For the physically disabled.
---
I realy hope someone will update the "Eaves drop" addon. 
---
I've become so used to it, basically replaces your combat logg with a much better one. 
---
Also shows when enemy used kick or similar abilities so it's great in pvp as well. 
---
Shows incoming heals etc also, realy handy in a neat little UI window.
---
I've been proven wrong and can't think of anything to say back. Lets just type out a mocking comment in return that's completely unrelated to the question because that will show him. 
---
Saying that people knowing where to go in quests instead on wandering around like fking idiots in 14 year old game and that breaking your immersion of a game is pretty absurd statement.
---
Xmas day in exchange for my social life. Tough call.
---
Can't cater to only the hardcore or you lose the whole point of the game. The point is not to allow the hardcore pirate server veterans to rush through content, force blizz to put out more content they will fly through and then have nobody left at all because they rushed the content out.
---
We need the game to last, which means having a content schedule the same or longer than vanilla had. Vanilla forced people to rush, and assuming that at the end of this content period (2-3 years from now) they will have something else to push out (Classic TBC maybe) which is not a crazy thought. We will need to leave enough time that casuals can actually do content before the first run is over.
---
And going human :D Earlier that stream he said how he gains a lot more from being human but in reality dwarf racial's are superior for pvp and would have made a difference in the fight.
---
I feel like thrash blade might not do enough DPS when you could take something better in comparison. Same thing for mainhand, if you could get a good sword + sword mastery thingy + wf totem.   
---
Let's not forget that rogues need poison and AFAIK poisons don't stack with windfury.
---
A general rule is not to blink before a stun.
---
Dwarf hunter if hunter for pvp (night elf is also useful since rogues are usually defending, stealth defense is pretty good). Nelf if PvE priority.
---
Gnome mage, never go human. Gnome is strictly better, a useful racial  and 5% more int.
---
The vast majority of players in vanilla were what I would consider casual. I'm not sure how it will be this time but raiders were few and far between when I played and I was on a pretty high pop server. Typically the casual players would clear through MC with pugs and stuff to get some gear going. Once AQ came out blizz released the 2.5 sets in old dungeons where you could summon new bosses to kinda help bridge the gap. Also at this point I remember a lot of the MC pug groups started moving to AQ20 which was doable if you had the 2.5 sets, also ZG gear was really good and helped compete - I remember lots of PUGS for that as well.
---
This time around I fully expect there to be way more PUGS for ZG and AQ20 for more casual players where weekends are probably the majority of your playable time. It's of course not as good as AQ40 and Naxx gear but it does help bridge the gap as opposed to say being in Pre raid BiS dungeon gear vs someone in AQ40 stuff.
---
5.6% and 8.6%
---
The hardest thing about wow (even bfa) is finding other people that don’t suck
---
Because classic is not a remaster, they’re not dying to make the game better. They’re just trying to make it like it was.
---
***Fun fact*** \- since i shared the tool on Reddit 1.5 hour ago, 2600 calculations have already been made :) (source: Google Analytics)
---
I know what u mean but some addons are just to important like a damage metter hard to ban then all
---
Good luck doing Vashj or any BC boss without DBM and when you tell them “I don’t use addons” hope they laugh. 
---
Shit doesn’t exist like this for a reason. 
---
Cause it’s retarded.
---
They’ve said it’s not guaranteed, and if it does happen it would be in a late(r) phase
---
As someone who played both games, I can say that the penalty for mistakes was far greater in EQ but to be honest the game was much easier to play as a single character. The game was in fact so easy that you could play 3-4 character at maximum efficiency nearly as well as 1 person because the commands and casting times were so slow and melee basically didn't have to move or do anything besides backstab or flying kick. Maybe you could play 3-4 wow characters as well with near efficiency but wow has a lot more fights and mechanics that involve movement and more cooldowns and key inputs required than everquest.
---
not sure about that. Most people could be coming from retail. And the vast majority of retail players level as fast as possible because they don't care about the leveling experience.
---
Stone form also clears devouring plague and serpent thing :)
---
I don't think luck has anything to do with BiS list.
---
Deep elem blues is an old Americana song not necessarily a dead reference.
---
Honestly, 6 hours does seem excessive, but I‘m weak and I don‘t think I could handle less than 6 hours of sleep each night for 2 whole weeks.
---
&gt;Like why prot pally?
---
Prot pally because Blessing of kings in everyone + pets and blessing of sanctuary on tank.
---
Ret would be useless he would do no damage. And he didn't have gear for holy
---
Setup is good but you'd better get some loose pants if you plan to no-life the release. Your nuts will thank you later.
---
It’s literally like the 5th post down from this one
---
Melee classes tend to prefer slower weapons because of instant attacks and CD timers on windfury/command
---
Lol, what are your actual specs?
---
Theres alot more to requirements than what operating system you have.
---
Well done! They look great! Now comes the hard part of choosing which one to use...
---
U said dwarf scales badly. If i want to be a human, dwarf, or nelf. What is the best class for pvp i could possible choose out of these races? Is it dwarf hunter?
---
I'll let you in on a way I made a ton of money over the years that I don't see anyone else talk about.
---
If you browse the AH you will notice that a lot of people only change the Buyout price when they list an item and leave the starting bid price at the default. So occasionally you can pick up items for a fraction of the cost which you can turn around and sell for a nice profit.
---
For an extreme example: you might find a mid-level blue or epic listed for 100g and a starting bid of 75s. If you win a bid on that, even if the bid price ends up rising to 50g, you can turn around and relist the item for a significant profit for minimal effort.
---
Didn’t windfury work like this as well?
---
"And we're gonna put some trees out here in Stranglethorn. Just a few..well, maybe more than a few. Who knows? That's the magic of imagination. Just paint what's in your minds eye. Mmm. That's nice. Right over here by the Arena, we'll even add in the skeleton of some mage who got curb-stomped while trying to herb by the coastline.  Magic is  in the details, my friend."
---
To all commething on my phrase.
---
I don't know on your country, but in mine a lot of media sites were publishing at least one article related to WoW Beta and to the chance of being selected for that. 
---
That's just my opinion, if you did not have this feeling...its ok
---
hunters make it possible.
---
That pvp build is pretty shit if you aren't really geared. Cold blood is what makes naked rogues work
---
My friend got a beta access without having active sub, so thats false.
---
ya rly
---
Buddhist did a popular video doing this back in bc. He was doing pvp and arenas or something. It's prolly on YouTube or Warcraftmovies still
---
You guys will have lots of fun. That's the point.
---
To clarify, if you ran engaged mobs close enough to OTHER engaged mobs, the combats would chain together. Once you yourself got out of combat those chasing you would naturally go to the still engaged players (this happened without you breaking combat if someone healed \[AoE threat\]).
---
I did this all the time back in vanilla.
---
As a healer i liked grid, and Sraidframes i believe it was called. 
---
It allows the raidframes to go "grey" when the ppl are away from your healing range, and turns colored nameplate when they're in range. 
---
Helps so much with visability this way esp for bg healing. Nothing more annoying than trying to heal someone only for them being way to far off. But raidframes show they're being in range.
---
So having custom range addon in the raidframes realy helps. 
---
I'm sure some version of it will be updated. 
---
Decursive is another addon i rly like, but i heard blizzard will not allow that one anymore.
---
Well, the real problem is more the grouping thing. If you group but everyone knows where exactly all is is like you have the addon yourself. I just would like a server of "like-minded" players so the grouping adventuring go nice and interesting. u.u 
---
I returned to play on Atlantiss some time ago, but left because that everyone that I grouped with had add-ons really bothered me.
---
WoW is truly like heroin for me. If i start playing again I know id go ALL IN.
---
Gotta stay cold turkey
---
Keep checking here for 1.13 addons: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/
---
Wow that's an even dumber statement than "addons are cheating". They aren't, they're a tool. Do you think using a hammer to put nails into something is cheating and you are only supposed to hammer them in with your bloody stumps that you once called hands?
---
Also you posted a question on a social media platform. That's tacitly asking for peoples opinion's champ.
---
Love making gold in vanilla. Saw a guy that tried to get his silk cloth shown first with a 1 copper bid amount.
---
He forgot to cancel and I bought 20g worth of silk for a few copper. Was a battle and didn't get em all ofc, but quite a lot of gold for a lvl 20^^
---
Yeah, I am a middleman for some of these sites and I facilitated about  3 trades ~1000-1200 yesterday.
---
It's a 8.0 client, not 1.12, so addons will work more similar to how they did in legion than vanilla
---
What will get you ahead most is the time you invest.
---
Some will play 15+ hours a day at start, others only 1-2 hours due to RL.
---
Also having a good guild for raids (even the low level stuff) can help a lot.
---
A shame they are the best you’ll get while leveling.
---
No they didn't
---
I'm seriously thinking about going prot for classic leveling because I want to be that guy, any tips? Overall speed compared to not prot?
---
Yeah that's just like asking for someone to post 10 of their own for 1c less in my eyes.
---
Well, asshole, you didn't specify what you meant by early vanilla. I took it as early raids/early content.
---
Well that's unfortunate. Hopefully that's fixed.
---
https://willitclassic.com/ I think this is a better site.
---
That is a good question. Must be a special kind of a person if that sounds like massive Beta test where everyone will be invited to have a party.
---
Lol, OK.
---
OP has confirmed a lot of that time is changing, eating, prep etc
---
Let’s say it’s 1hr sport a day
---
That’s perfectly normal and healthy
---
holy shit, YES
---
Get a load of this Edge^^masters Lord
---
Thanks a bunch !
---
You the real MVP
---
You're forgetting sunder.
---
I don't think you're right. The number of people who played warrior in Vanilla, but also stopped playing before Shield Slam was buffed, but also were in-tune enough with game knowledge at that time to have heard it wasn't worth using, but also never heard it got buffed, but also wouldn't do any research or listen to their more game knowledgeable friends to not know it got buffed.... For someone to be affected by all those many factors and decide now in TYoOL 2019 to not spec into Shield Slam, I'm just not convinced those people would exist in any significant quantity.
---
There were some people back in the day who tried to make an argument for AoE tanking with Sweeping Strikes, but those people were either not raiding or weren't raiding with DPS who were as effective as they could have been.
---
Consider that the naive approach to talent trees by someone who does no research is going to be trusting that Blizzard made the capstone talents the best ones.
---
Ergo, you will have informed players picking up Shield Slam because it does insane threat and naive players picking it up because it's the end of the tree. The only people ignoring it will be people trying to be special snowflakes or whose game knowledge is limited to one tiny period of history of the game where it was bad.
---
Exactly. The game launches midnight for us so alot of energy drinks and coffee will be downed. 
---
CANT 
---
WAIT
---
Priorities. I'm sure you could do more than 10 hours if you didn't have other hobbies.
---
I'm not sure it lets you enter ZF at level 30 :(
---
You can get beta access without sub but if you try to play the classic beta it will ask you to sub first.
---
Yea why bother reading official statements when you can read stuff from "media sites".
---
I’ve been invited to the last 3 retail betas from the start but not this one, this looks more like media/streamer only invite, maybe a few more.
---
Sounds like your friend is lying to you [because it's specifically stated on their website that you need an active sub.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule)
---
“I didn’t asked for your opinion”
---
Proceeds to post on reddit where people give opinions. 
---
Close to up boys. Thread is done.
---
Dunno if fury will be as powerful as it has been in the past due to /sit not working to proc enrage on demand. Picking up 5/5 cruelty for the crit chance would definitely be worth it anyway you slice it though.
---
Hello! I am looking for a dedicated leveling partner for the first 1-3 days (and all the way to 60 if we can align past the first 24/36 hours)
---
I'm looking for an undead Mage or undead priest to start leveling with right away. I will be playing a Undead mage or an Undead Rogue (pending my guilds needs)  I will be rolling on one of the Horde, US, PVP servers
---
I have a fully planned out leveling route for 1-30, including doing RFC, WC, and SFK for stacking all the quests and getting early gear (and fun!) 
---
After 30 I plan on following Joana's guide.
---
A little about me - I'm 31 years old, played vanilla wow, and have played most expansions since BC, raiding and PVPing "hardcore". I have a realm first max level achievement and enjoy leveling.
---
I plan on playing minimum 16 hours from launch time for classic, and am looking for someone dedicated to the first 16 hours at least, who has no issue hopping on discord to talk to save time. After that, I would like to continue
---
but that is optional. I am not aiming for any firsts, but do enjoy min/maxing my experience.
---
If this sounds good and you consider yourself someone who will take this first 16 hours seriously in order to get ahead of the rush and level as quickly as possible, let me know!
---
No xperl? D: fml
---
I thought they ended up killing mograine pretty easily after the rogue respec?
---
Did he Hibernate a player around the 15 min mark?
---
I specced 3/3 improve blizzard but the company still sucks!!?!? Roflmao
---
Bug/Problem encountered: the alternate death effect is seemingly missing from classic (also from live btw)
---
When you die you normally enter an alternate world, black and white; if you disable it (/console SET ffxGlow "0" I think) you used to have an "alternate" death effect;
---
a death atmosphere, but with colors (brownish skies, kind of eerie place). I can't get this to work since legion I think, and I can't get it to work in Classic. which is a problem, as I think this effect should be preserved.
---
Examples...
---
[here's the non-black and white death effect I'm trying to point out](https://imgur.com/a/bM9Qt6C) (taken in 2013)

---
thank you
---
This is fun, I'd love to see some estimates on leveling as groups. I personally plan on leveling as a trio with my buddies
---
Man...reddit...
---
Do you really think all media sites publish articles by their own will?
---
Or maybe, just maybe, they could get paid to do so?
---
Easily. I leveled a priest 1-60 on a fresh server in oct 06 in ~8 days played while grinding a bunch of dungeons along the way and doing a ton of off the beaten path quests. Average player was much worse then, and most of my guild hit 60 in like 16 or 17 real life days.
---
where did you get this done?
---
Corruption, curse of agony, deathcoil, fear. How about 4?
---
Yep, I'm fine waiting. It would be cool to poke around, but if I don't get in, I'm happy to derp around in other games as I wait for Classic launch. I'm most excited about playing with my husband, so the beta doesn't even have the best feature of Classic WoW - him! :D

Thanks, that took a bit of a load off my shoulders :P
---
I'm fairly certain this only works for humanoids and other mobs that actually assist each other. I don't believe this is a thing for entirely neutral stuff like bears (unless you skin them, of course).
---
poor pallys shammys warlocks dont get to have inventory space in raids
---
&gt;this looks more like media/streamer only invite,
---
that is exactly what it is. 1 of the biggest streamers was even on stream begging blizzard to invite his buddy. His buddy got invited.
---
Also, in the user manual (french version sorry), we were told about a dishonor system for killing lower level targets. At some point, even your faction's NPC were able to attack you on sight. I guess they just try this system with the goblins/Pirates factions in Booty bay but that's it.  [https://ibb.co/bL4RF7L](https://ibb.co/bL4RF7L)

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a large guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!

---
This was going on the exact same time as the alliance stream and added to so much hype. Horde starts out way faster, but consider this: on the alliance stream there were ZERO deaths. :)
---
I think he meant Demoralizing Shout, which should generate a little threat IIRC.
---
Classic will be 64 bit only.
---
https://www.geekifyinc.com/product/custom-game-cloth-map-rpg-gaming-printing-service/ &lt;-- right there!
---
There was basically one patch where Shield Slam was added and it was dubious if the threat per rage was worth it, and it got buffed almost immediately. Especially after sunder is already at 5. Ideally, you made a DPS warrior stack the sunders for you so you could Shield Slam sooner. It was that good in 1.12 ( in single target raid tanking scenarios).
---
Paladins
---
I'm not a special kind of person. 
---
As I stated in a comment below, in my country at least, many (and I repeat MANY) media sites published the Closed Beta Event. That never happened so much with other betas. 
---
That's just my thought.
---
Form of advertisment from a company may come also by third party sites.
---
An additional hunter adds way more.
---
And that has something to do with you not understanding that there are Blizzards official platforms where you can read official statements in 2 seconds if you are not a fucking retard?
---
I see seal of command used on 1-handers in a lot of old videos, did it work differently, is it actually viable or were people just not very good?
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. I had no idea who all these streamers were. Fun stream though and added to the hype for sure: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/430190162](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/430190162)
---
You joke but that was certainly true for Rogue's in TBC and WoTLK.  I think like 70-75% of my damage was white damage during the Icecrown era.
---
Vanilla is too far back to remember the breakdown.
---
Utility which modern wow doesn't like.
---
The game looks so cool when you arent max zoomed out and just turning small dots in the ground from a birds eye view.
---
I have great pc at home but i'm working at sea for next 4 months just tried to log into bfa after couple of months and it said i need 64 bit, before it needed i played with stabile 30 fps i don't exactly know my specs now, but i can bet it will run smoothly just needed to know will i be able to play with this laptop when they relise it
---
yep, if there was one class i'd play without giving a shit about the racial though it's mage

The launch will be FULL of clueless players, and many won't even care too much about gold, because they don't intend to keep playing for long.

And even after the player numbers are settled, the population will consist of 5% of players that know stuff and 95% that think they know.
---
Do you have any respect for people's opinion without calling them retards?
---
30 day Mail returns (pretty sure it was 5 days) and multiple item mail... i think. I think even cross server whispers are possible (havent tried but you can see name-betapvpserver or whatever). 
---
There may be a lot more but my frame of mind is 1.0 release with where the game is right now content wise and i misremember things. There was a ton of things even updated within vanillas lifespan that makes thr game not be #nochanges. If youre telling me that the 1.12 talents wont make the game a lot different youre crazy. 
---
Would I like to see them do balance patches and versions of the game with all the content phases? Yeah. Hell yeah I do. But I cant expect it.
---
Thats why im totally fine with SOME small convieniences. I trust their judgement with what has been implemented and dont have any issues with what ive had in game. It feels right. Changes can only make it feel wrong.
---
Thanks for making this, I’m sure it took a lot of work. Your sound quality and voiceover is all good too 👍👍
---
Having these streamers shows the average person playing this game. Most people will pick it up and stop playing after. How is it selfish to be happy they aren’t wasting their time?
---
Its very doable. If you play 50 hours a week, in a month you'll have around 8 days play time. Definitely possible even if you're not a seasoned speedrun leveler.
---
I have never had this issue... I play on my laptop when I travel and I’ve gone all over the United States, sometimes even playing in the south in the morning, and the west coast later that night.
---
This plane setup is too new. Look for an older one for that authentic feel
---
We will see.
---
The hunter one i lol'd
---
Yes it's not like masterloot exists or anything. It took me 245 runs for me to get Ironfoe myself on the latest server I played on. Every single one of those runs were done with Masterloot, because I am not a moron.
---
Will A mainhand like [Tooth of Eranikus](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10837) better for an orc warrior considering hit is scarce early on and extra 4% basicly on mainhand and 1% for your offhand seems also pretty good. For both, consistant damage and rage generation.
---
I did
---
The cringe is real. WAHHH I DIDNT GET BETA I DESERVED IT. Wait two months m8.
---
Oh yeah? Well have a look at the warrior trinket then. Literally BiS.
---
Oh right the trolls, ok thanks!
---
Very slow and slow leveling gives the same date, love the site tho.
---
I absolutely agree with you. I sincerely hope that they properly tune the bosses keeping the 16 debuff cap in mind. It would be really sad to see Ragnaros fall the first few days people hit 60 (not fully BiS dungeon geared)...
---
This is no longer working either. I de-equipped my quiver and autoshot was still just winding up with no release.  Tried on NE and Orc to confirm.
---
Jesus the retail is really burned into your skull isn’t it
---
It can be abused though. A single player who owns a 1 man guild getting that much extra space is a big deal. Every bit of restriction put on your characters is what  made classic challenging. If you doubt it, try leveling without any bags. I got to westfall without any dropping and had to full stop farm for bags. Bagspace is just another challenge in game.
---
IIRC they usually had 3-4 options that you could choose from because of this, right?
---
Spreading total bullshit and misinformation is not an opinion. I don't respect persons who do that.
---
Isn't blessing of salvation better than windfury since it basically allows 30% more output
---
Presumably if you're selling your account you won't log on immediately before the buyer does. Blizzard isn't going to ban me for moving across the country or going on a trip. They just have to not be blatantly obvious.
---
Did you just get offended by my statement mate? Are we at this stage on the subreddit that people can't have opinions? Get a grip man ...
---
His name.
---
Joana is 4.83 days.
---
He did it in 4days 20 hours.
---
Yep this is weird
---
I used to box 4 characters at once in Dire Maul for shards and the great hunt for the compendium.  I'd say both games were easy to box, but cast times in EQ were much longer and more forgiving.
---
No
---
Once they get to 40?
---
I Hamstring Kite from level 8
---
stats
---
That is pretty normal though. People get geared up and have no reason to show up anymore, in a casual raiding guild.
---
That is not Blizzard's fault, unless Blizz specifically contacted each media outlet and said "HYPE THIS UP ITS GONNA BE HUGE".
---
People will report things in a way that drives more readership. This is why when you want OFFICIAL information, you get it straight from Blizzard, not some third party media writing the thousandth article on the subject hoping to catch the hype train of internet traffic.
---
Every single year when I take my annual trip to San Antonio, (i live in nyc) as soon as I try to log in my account is instantly locked and I need to contact support to have it unlocked. 
---
Maybe there is a setting im missing but it’s like clockwork, instant locks every time.
---
Warlock was the most fun class for me. Once you hit Soul Link you were a force to be reckoned with on PvP realms
---
&lt;Eye of Insanity&gt; **[A] [US] [Pve] [Pacific] [Hardcore]**
---
**_Introduction_**  
---
Eye of Insanity is a guild formed specifically for those who want to be the best on their server and have fun while they do it. We are looking for competitive raiders who enjoy pushing themselves and their guildmates to always be improving. 
---
**_Goals and Expectations_**   
---
Be repectful of the time that everyone puts into getting together. Have consumables ready, do your research of the expected fights, be online and ready to enter the raid at raid time, and be willing to change and adapt as needed during raids. 
---
During raids during any strat explanation or boss pull, chatter is to be kept at a minimum and everyone should be focused on the task at hand. It is expected that everyone raiding understands that the good of the guild is priority number one, and loot will be used to help us succeed as a whole, not just individuals. 
---
**_Guild Culture_**  
---
Classic WoW is very much a game based around community, and having fun, and we want to keep that atmosphere in this guild. You can both be committed to efficient raiding and still like the people you play with. This is an adult guild, so expect adult topics, some swearing etc.
---
We do expect members to be respectful of each other and the fact that people come from a variety of walks of life. Any racism, sexism, homophobia, etc will not be tolerated. There's no ban on talking about controversial subjects, but try not to get divisive over politics, religion, etc. We all share a common interest in Classic WoW, and the golden rule applies here. We are all adults, and there may be people you just don't get along with. We expect people to be able to handle themselves in a mature way. Anyone causing drama will be removed from the guild. 
---
We interview each member in voice chat to make sure that everyone will be a good fit for the guild and for each other. 
---
**_Raid Information_**  
---
We raid Tues/Wed 7:30-11PM Pacific, adding Thurs as needed (which is unlikely until Naxx is out).
---
We use a loot council comprised of the raid leader, role officers, and rotating members of the core raid team. 
---
**_Contact_**  
---
Battletag: Azula#11142
---
So this is the thing. It looks like you want to play the strongest version. But you don't like the strongest version (gnome). So unless you just commit to one or the other, you will have buyers remorse no matter what you play. Either way you will feel like your losing out, whether it's min/max or aesthetic. 
---
My advice? Decide which is more important to you. If you want THE BEST numbers wise then the look is completely irrelevant. If you want The most attractive to look at, then you won't worry about being the absolute possible best mage ever.  In the end, its your toon. Choose and commit and never look back. 
---
Please don't torture yourself.
---
lavaruns bby
---
Have you always been this immature?
---
I did not spread any bullshit or misinformation.
---
I just said MY OPINION and honestly, apart from saying yours, you do have no right on insulting.
---
Exactly. On top of this the Elemental spec actually includes a bunch of resto talents, such as Nature's Swiftness (You want this for burst damage in PvP).
---
The loss of not going full resto is easily overcome with a couple more pieces of gear. If people successfully healed dungeons in 2005 using Restogear with 100 bonus heal and the T0 Elements Set.
---
The main thing you are missing by not going full resto is having talents to reduce mana cost on heal, and talents too bost your healing by 10%.
---
Both are more than easily made up for by healers these days having 400+ more bonus heal than they used to back in the day, while downranking to conserve mana.
---
If you stick to about 7 hours per day for 30 days you'll have 8d18h /played, which should make level 59 easily obtainable.
---
There's a Vanilla Camelot server out there. You don't know what pain is until  you've tried it.
---
Pathetic
---
You should add a speed level called private server autist. 
---
Those guys can beat Joana's time by a day.
---
Every raiding guild will want one and only one shadow priest in every raid.
---
He said not to invest. That means associated risks. Riding is an instant reward and RoI. Theres no risk of losing any money besides the down payment as you dont have to keep relisting and looking for a buyer.
---
It’s really not as bad as you make it sound.
---
I didn't realize the Troggs would drop cloth as well, thanks. In my head all I was thinking was wolves and boars, lol. Forgot about the Troggs and Trolls right in the starting area.
---
Always an edgelord standing in the fire!
---
Hey heads up: the release date for where I live is August 26th 3pm PST. Your calculator will not let me select the 26th as my starting date.
---
Yes you did, yes i have.
---
Futura Condensed Medium
---
Well considering that you can only fit in ONE shadowpriest in a 40man, not ideal and when it comes to premades, bringing in spriest means dropping mage or hunter usually which isnt ideal
---
Shadow priest is a nice for fun pvp spec for world pvp and solo BG's, it doesn't work well in premades because how dispells fucks them.
---
In PvE you want someone with shadoweaving. Some guilds choose a healer with semi shadow, some guilds have a shadow priest. The healing shadowweave is slightly better, but shadow is fun so most guilds pick that. Though be warned that we're talking literally ONE spot per guild.
---
"GG WP"
---
Do you think paraphrasing neonazi slogans is a good look for your guild?
---
Yes, thanks! I did forget they could drop cloth.
---
Except they can't dual wield in vanilla haha
---
Yo! This comment kinda stuck out to me.. East Coast, "fellers", something tells me we have a few things in common. Me and some friends are starting to recruit for our Classic WoW guild. 
---
I made a post here but the formatting is kind of wonky since I did it from my phone. We're called "Quidi Vidi Society". Message back if you're interested!
---
Why?
---
So much nonsense on this sub at times...
---
Paladins are such safe and steady levelers with many tools at their disposal ... 
---
Except for any interaction with whatever they're fighting, especially with sitting down-crits not proccing reckoning.
---
The meme from 2005 about Paladins being the perfect class for alt-tabbing to watch porn are legit true.
---
Mana is a nonissue, you just keep seal up - auto something to death - holy light - rinse repeat
---
It's hilariously boring compared to Rogue/Warrior however
---
There will be mass invite guilds. (avoid these)
---
There will be hardcore raiding guilds that will make you write a 5 page comprehensive application. (double avoid these)
---
Then there will be guilds who meet people while dungeoning and hosting PUGs that will ask you to join because they think you're cool and play decently.  (these are the guilds I advocate for people to join)
---
Interesting! What’s the utility they bring to the table? I heard Mind control is good in BWL but is that the main thing? Are they desired pre  BWL in MC and Ony?
---
ouch
---
Ok. I really hope you are this kind of lion even in real life :)
---
that is insane, mostly the double multishot arcaneshot burst
---
You're thinking of the new decursive.  The one that was around in vanilla didn't require targeting, you'd just press the button.
---
50 hours per week means you will spend about 200 hours before that 30 days. That's 8 days 8 hours /played, very do-able as long as you just focus on leveling instead of doing random stuff.
---
Sent you a PM
---
Was a game feature that was not in Vanilla. Hate to be mean but people asking for such changes wont make it past level 15. Leave the decision making to people who will be invested long term into the game.
---
I'm sure something like decursive will work, but it won't be like the one live in vanilla, which required neither mouseover nor targeting at all.
---
In your opinion. What is the best pvp class i could choose out of dwarf, human, nelf ?
---
You have to remember this isn't talking about raid content, just the game in general.
---
Nope. Lots of headcannon in this thread of people thinking they remember how things work or wanting them to work how they want. Take most gameplay differences people post here without documented proof from 04-06 as fluff.
---
Don't remember the outcome but yes they made it through I think.
---
How did I forget about that... spamming jump to reduce lava damage taken so you could reach the next safe zone, only for someone to pull two elementals and wipe haha
---
40 is nice but warriors have a lot of levels to look forward to.
---
Getting execute at 24 or Whirlwind especially, at 36 are crucial abilities that really help change the leveling for the better.
---
Locked=\= banned my dude
---
Yeah he's calculations seem very pessimistic.
---
Yeah I see your point that WOTF is useful vs classes a mage would struggle against. But would using WOTF enable you to beat a warlock? It just seems to me that due to the nature of the classes you will have a hard time with warlocks as a mage regardless. 
---
Using escape artist to get rid of slows and roots, would allow you to save your blink for something else.
---
It seems to me escape artist with 1 min cooldown would enable a mage more than WOTF with 3 min cooldown.
---
What about the improved mail and the countless other minor UI improvements listed already in other comments in this thread?  Should they be reversed?
---
I hope you check your facts next time before you start doing claims that aren't right.
---
I find that a bit crazy for most people. The record was over 4 days played, but even if you could get to 60 in 4 days played, you'd have to play 6 hours every single day to do that in 16 real life days. Impossible? Of course not, but it's basically a full time job, and that's assuming you can beat the world record.
---
I chose "Dark Portal \[ver. A\]", but also downloaded a few others. Really nice work, thanks for sharing!
---
Question: Add X in Classic 
---
Answer: No changes
---
Safer, but probably same depending on competence.  It could go faster.
---
Yeah please. Fast would be 5-6 depending on the class, normal 9-10, and slow doesn't matter much because it's extremely variable at this point.
---
I hope you can really make difference between a claim and an opinion.
---
Possible: yes for many of them, if you are way overleveled, no for the high ones.
---
Guild: here, forum, ingame. There will be a lot of guilds recruiting in August and September I'm sure.
---
Class: Whatever you like best, all are viable, all have pros and cons. There is a lot of info about everything on google or YouTube. 
---
guides are also everywhere.
---
About missing content: there is way too much content for a single character. Just play as you want, and if you get bored make a new character in a different region.
---
Are you likely to have to run a guild bank in Classic?  Have you ever run one?
---
I mean it's from 2005 so yeah people were mostly shit :P
---
you can definitely do all of this :) i tested Airport and Hyjal myself
---
Most of my guild was college students, playing a whole assload of time each day. 10-12 Hours basically.
---
Soloist? Hunter.
---
Can you finish it ALL? Probably. There are some crowded areas in certain places... maybe have a reliable friend in case?
---
Minor UI changes such as colorblind mode and enhanced graphics are not game features. Game features are what distinguish expansion to expansion. Guild banks were a game feature introduced in Burning Crusade and therefore do not belong prior to 1.12
---
Yeah it was in BC. I tanked ZA with the season 3 caster mace, as it had a lot of stam and spellpower.
---
You are an obvious troll and a bad one at that. Addons were a part of Vanilla and not all of them cheapen the game like you claim. Some addons are purely for immersion...such as the addon immersion. It actually tries to get more people to actually read the quest text by making it more of an experience rather than just a wall of text.
---
If you don't want addons then don't download any. But to attack others because your feelings are hurt that an aspect of Vanilla Wow is making it into Classic WoW is just petty. Grow up.
---
If I remember correctly it was aimed shot then double multi shot burst and if you’re geared you will blow someone up.
---
That’s super weird, do you use the two factor authentication? I don’t, and have the most minimal account security  possible or it could be that the system knows my account is logged into from different locations often for the last several years?
---
I was that annoying 13 year old that was just barely competent enough to raid in a group, but not wise enough to learn how to improve on my own.
---
By the time Wrath had come, i was where i needed to be to be competitive. Now, i can do the same with classic. Feels pretty exciting to have this chance.
---
Telling others what to say sure will make people happy
---
Thank you for the advice! I was a hunter and vanilla so I know how difficult it is getting in raids 😩
---
Do you know which race goes best? I imagine dwarf on alliance for fear ward utility but in horde do you know if UD or Troll does better?
---
 [http://wowauberouge.free.fr/index.php?0=Videos](http://wowauberouge.free.fr/index.php?0=Videos) 
---
Can't believe there is still a video of it. That was during the raid days though...
---
That is -50 dkp for not having DBM installed
---
I dont care, you want to play an easier wow with mo QOL you have retail. Classic = Classic, not classic + X
---
Well, 30 days is basically 4 weeks.
---
You do 50 hours per week. that's means 200 hours in total. which is 8.3 days in /played. (200/24 = 8.3333).
---
Honestly if you level for the first time it always takes longer, than the times you see. A normal gamer with a normal gaming intellegence gets like 6-7 days played, leveling fast. not wasting time on things.
---
8 days played is for sure doable for a priest, but you shouldn't do anything stupid and level in a decently high octane pace.
---
i'd also recommend to follow a leveling guide to be safe.
---
Don't do professions, rather than skinning for the mount at 40 (you just vendor all the skin and get enough gold at 40). Professions eat a lot of time. 
---
And be careful with dungeons. some of them not worth doing, and you can get stuck for hours with a bad group and all the traveling and waiting.
---
Real talk, if you level for the first time in vanilla, and If you aren't careful you can get more than 8 days played. and not meet your times. 
---
So yea as i said, aim to level in a high pace, and don't do many distracting things. 
---
You can do some dungeons, but I really wouldnt do like all of them. It could eat up too much time.
---
Soda cleared Cath too.
---
Oh man, I just realized after reading this that we're getting Volley back! Like, the real Volley! This makes me so happy to think about
---
they send an email, and it'll appear as a [drop down](http://puu.sh/Dy0Ap/ee576b8097.png) in the blizzard client.
---
Sometimes depending on the quest.  Even still it wasn’t a guarantee that you could even use or want the three options they gave you
---
Absolutely not. The highest tps warriors tank as a fury/prot hybrid with a shield for rare occasions. This allows your DPS to go maximum, making windfury far superior to salv.
---
I am not the one having problems with that.
---
He literally told me to do that
---
There was legitimately a stretch of time in January-February I walked from my apartment to the internet cafe every day for two weeks, and just Raid days for a month after until I could replace my dead computer.
---
Classic + guild banks != retail
---
If you're going to compare holy/prot vs ret/holy then you need to take into account eye for an eye and vindication, both of which are great pvp talents. You can do a 13/7/31 build which picks up improved freedom, redoubt and still get all the important talents in Holy/Ret. But yeah, improved conc will be missed sadly.  
---
You seem to be stuck in the BFA mentality of the spec defining the class, which is not true for classic. I can wear t2 as ret and still be a great healer. You still haven't explained why BoSac doesn't work for ret because ret is "in the front".   
---
CC is great, which is why I'd much rather have two longer CD CCs which I can chain on separate DRs than one shorter CD CC on the same DR. 
---
Honestly, if the only thing you're going to do is heal, then you're going to be OOM in 30 seconds. You're underestimating what a ret can do by playing defensive between heals and spreading vindication to incoming rogues and warriors.
---
You really really want a healing buddy as a warrior.
---
Go arms for levelling and dungeon tanking. It will be tempting to at least take cruelty in fury talents, but if you stick with arms only until lvl 40 you don’t have to respecc for mortal strike. Take tactical mastery and anger management.
---
Use ranged pulls/facepulls in dangerous areas, keep up with first aid and food, take gathering professions and save your money while levelling (no auction house BOEs!) if you want any hope of mount at lvl 40 and BiS BOEs at 60 (lion heart helm mainly)
---
Not comprehensive, but a good way to avoid some mistakes I’ve made on the numerous warriors I’ve levelled. I learned the hard way so you don’t have to.
---
So proud.
---
Go have a shower of humilty, you need it.
---
You don’t find that absolutely hilarious?
---
I started playing at 1.8 as a Night Elf Warrior and literally never even hit 60 before TBC. FWIW. 
---
Also I was like 13. So that probably didn't do me any favors.
---
Wonder if DynamicCam will be implemented for Classic. Not sure if/how the camera changed since Vanilla and if it would be possible to use DynamicCam in Classic though. Combine it with Immersion and it can make for quite an immersive experience.
---
Also “I don’t care” = you haven’t had to run a guild bank = think seriously before you answer please
---
Damn so nothing till i get home
---
Tuning versus scripting is important. Rag went down first week with maybe 33 level 60s. I'm pretty sure it was on one of the prime time private releases.
---
Fixed.
---
are you sure it's a bug? afaik battle shout threat was bugged on private servers for the longest time. Iirc it should only generate threat when it buffs a player not already affected by it, making it pretty useless in tanking
---
New players, they exist
---
The great thing about classic is the game starts at lvl 1.
---
Lvl one till max isn't a glorified tutorial like it is on retail.
---
You can have so much fun from the very beginning.
---
Rupture in dungeons and in pvp versus heavy armor targets you don't plan to blind (ex: 5-8 kiting a warrior).  Because your rupture and eviscerate will change a bit as you gear up, you may find at certain points it isn't worth rupturing even if the dot goes all the way, but for most of your max level time, a 5 CP rupture will outperform a 5 CP eviscerate.  As you say, you can't in raids for the debuff limit reason.
---
This trinket is already bis for trash or bosses that die super quick and have adds (Like Lucifron)
---
Not sure why you, instead of clarifying, decide to start calling names and being rude, but okay.Have fun being like that.
---
Thanks for reporting! Fixed.

Pretty sure your OP falls into the claim territory.
---
layering.  not having a new CE to get CE pets.  not giving me a beta key.  time-gating raids.
---
If you are fast leveling I would recommend not taking mining nor herbalism, you're gonna outlevel the zones you will need to up the professions. However, skinning is your friend.
---
You find players and Guilds by meeting players and guilds. By engaging in social interaction things
---
I have a Authenticator yea
---
Re-bind movement to ESDF. If you don't intend to tank literally ever you can even take off E and just use SDF for strafe left, move forward, strafe right, respectively.
---
&gt;GIANT NOSE, PURPLE CAPE, TELEPORT 20 FEET
---
Uuuuuuuhhhhh. Uuurrrrrrerrrrrrr
---
Lol because only low tier trash teams allow any Tauren that could play an orc. Enjoy playing with dickbags like that. That's hilariously retarded. I don't dispute that they hold a fractional advantage, only the emphasis you put on it.
---
Yes, TIL vanilla evocation scales with spirit and not percentage of your mana.
---
The spirit definitely is nice but I think that intellect is much more valuable for a mage and also your gear will have more intellect than spirit on.
---
They are both 5% though, so not extremely significant.  Main reason why I don’t want to play human because I think they are kind of boring and I think escape artist vs no escape artist is pretty significant.
---
God forbid you can take your time and enjoy it when it launches...
---
The joystick on the left hand is a dead giveaway.  Airbus and their fly-by-wire bullshit.
---
Indeed, I think they should have been excluded. The exception being color blind support though. 
---
In reality, I don’t think it’s feasible to expect zero changes in this scenario where classic is just 7.3.5 backported - some changes are inevitable. The problem I have is that most people seem to think that since some things have changed, it’s more acceptable to change additional things (while in truth it’s actually the opposite).
---
lol. Says the guy who made a snarky wise ass comment in the first place.
---
All Rares I killed so far only dropped White Items.
---
There will be cross realm bgs and I'm for it. 
---
That way the overpopulated horde don't need to wait an hour for queues.
---
And by last he means "most recent" not "final"
---
Elvui will be ready for classic, what’s the problem here
---
Yeah, we didn't hear about the closed beta until the day before it started. To me it seemed more like they deliberately kept a lid on it in order to keep expectations low. The big announcement was the release date, not the beta.
---
Shadow Weaving.
---
I've seen this question pop up a few times lately with all the posts about nighttime. Was watching SoupaSoka's first video after he got into the beta and saw this. Thanks u/SoupaSoka!
---
In case the timestamped url doesn't work as intended skip to 34:40.
---
Can you really stand looking at a gnome for the whole time you'll be playing?
---
Depends on the class combination.  You take a significant xp per mob penalty for being in a group of 3, so unless you're killing mobs 3x faster than solo (and there are a enough mobs to do this for quest items etc) then it'll be slower than solo.
---
Generally trio leveling is not very good, duo can be good if there's good class synergy.  For example warrior solo leveling is slow as fuck, paladin solo leveling is only slightly faster but both leveling together is practically zero downtime and super fast.  Pally/Warrior or shaman/Warrior or really any healer + warrior drastically speeds up leveling of both chars by more than 2x and therefore is worthwhile even when it comes to quest items and other stuff that cucks groups.
---
I can't see how leveling as 3 of anything would be worthwhile though.  It'll be less bad with good synergistic classes/specs but still unlikely to be 3x faster or higher which is what is needed to level at the same speed as solo.
---
Alliance has fear ward though.
---
You got this. ;)
---
Good old FFXI memories. Lose Goblin butcher at Yuhtunga jungle entrance after being zoned, goes wild on the three nearby parties fighting Mandys, just blowing them all the fuck up. 
---
Good times.
---
Ret pally was a joke from the beginning
---
It’s sort of neutral. Longer range can be an advantage against raid bosses and in PvP, longer melee range lets you wing clip melee before they can even touch you.
---
In vanilla you could jump most immobilisation and some stun effects like so https://youtu.be/Mh_cLN66zHA?t=942
---
This is not the case in classic as every CC every stops you midair. This is major in daily pvp and I'm sure there more implications.
---
Also sheep used to land u back to last spot you were registered in and not put you in air.
---
Fair point, thanks for being constructive. Upvoted
---
Crossing my fingers that at least somebody comes up with a good addon to reduce the manual admin of this tho...
---
Lmao that was some great rage honestly, but nah, I don't think I would watch that stream often.
---
I never got email for stress test it just showed up in launcher. To select like ptr.
---
In vanilla when you refreshed a Buff you technically lost the Buff then regained it. You could see that on the combat log/sct.
---
Battle shout was a way to generate a small amount of threat before the mobs reached you and then you'd switch to demo for aoe packs. It was pretty vital for stuff like suppression room.
---
Also you'd pull then pop bloodrage cause the rage gain gave threat.
---
A paladin is a slow leveling class. If you are playing an average of 30 hours per week and your leveling speed is normal you will probably ding level 60 somewhere around...
---
Monday 18 November 2019
---
(this will be 2.8 months from when you start playing on 26 August 2019)
---
Sounds good to me! Good work OP.
---
If so be into a server with a permanent level 30 cap. Or maybe a cap at 30 for a month or two, then 40, then 50, then finally 60.
---
Druids speed way up in vanilla once you get cat form.
---
Didn't know I don't care meant all that, guess I need a new English dictionary.
---
And then one mob got a double resist and the mage had a 4 min corpserun ahead of him
---
True. Except it won’t be released until ZG is out and it’s quite a grind to obtain. I got super lucky grabbing it in vanilla because basically no one in my guild knew what it was. For the quest I think you had to get like 6 mini charms off a boss most people would skip on ZG and if you’re fighting other players for the charms it could be a huge pain in the ass.
---
Ah that could be why, but I have no clue lol
---
I think that was part of the reason I chose warlock too. And because warlock just sounded badass as hell
---
Nah i am good.
---
Like I said, there will be plenty of profit to be had, but if you are looking to corner a market, it isn't going to happen very easily and not with easily farmable stuff. You can say the population will be small and that an even smaller portion will know what they are doing, which is mostly going to be true, but it's more than enough to spread out and lock down all the main markets of the economy between them. There's room to share without a doubt, but there's not going to be much room to lock anything down by yourself, which was the topic of what OP and the other guy was talking about.
---
No doubt, that wasn’t my concern.  Remove the class entirely and I still don’t think the equation is accurate.
---
Retail turned into a shitfest cause people crying for easier times. No changes.
---
You're taking way too much time for sleep and sports
---
Their philosophy on retail. It can still be a great game.
---
Should it be added? Probably. Will it? Doubt it. People are going to have to find creative work arounds like the old days. For example, our guild had a 2nd account owned by the GM that was used solely as a guild bank. Only officers had access and as far as I know, we never had any issues, but its is and was definitely against ToS. And with Blizz' tighter security controls these days, I dont know if that'll be possible.
---
Yep. Did they completely nerf the rogue version in BC as well?
---
That's the joke Drax..
---
It'll be my first time trying to "speedrun" leveling in vanilla, though I've speedrun leveling to get from 85-90, 100-110, 110-120.
---
I have an absolute ton of wow experience, but the numbers is what had me worried, that I genuinly wouldn't be able to do it within the guilds time frame. But it seems I'll likely be able to.
---
And, dungeon-wise I have a few musts, like BFD for that wand. Otherwise It'd just be dungeons I have quests for.
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Moon#Azeroth](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Moon#Azeroth)
---
Yeah it's definitely a small group that was invited and honestly, that's all good for me as long as the game is good at launch and honestly, we don't know they will probably open the beta up a lot more down the road.
---
Just keep in mind that classic is much more slow paced than wrath and newer expansions. Leveling isn't a rush, you will run out of quests and need to grind a little bit and gear will come much slower. Wrath really introduced a lot of mechanics to help you gear up super quick that classic doesn't have. All of this makes even minor improvements feel so much more satisfying such as getting a new weapon drop or even just a simple level up to get that new rank of skills.
---
Crazy numbers... I don't know about the other dude, but Themechanic (he streams) is either BiS geared or very close to it.
---
But rogues can do the same with crippling poison, right?
---
&gt;In vanilla when you refreshed a Buff you technically lost the Buff then regained it. You could see that on the combat log/sct.
---
yea but iirc, and unfortunately i don't have any sources at hand, battleshout would only generate threat when it was applied on someone not already affected by it. 
---
&gt;Battle shout was a way to generate a small amount of threat before the mobs reached you and then you'd switch to demo for aoe packs.
---
yep agree there, but again iirc, it would only generate threat once, so a very small amount of initial threat
---
Ale and wenches.
---
rofl, tried to HoJ an orc? lawl what a retail nub
---
I asked about the context of your comment relevant to my question? You decided to read it in your way, apparently.
---
"Don't make me get my main" is also a classic :D
---
You mean the [REAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPT5TWJNKjI) deal?  
---
Also my name is not related. I've been asked many times which is how I found those in the first place.
---
Just leave Activision it's not like they're providing good servers anyways
---
I'm almost 100% certain they used to stack.
---
Yeah exactly, dwarf racial is SO good vs rogues too.  Literally ZERO reason to go human in classic as a pally if ur focus is pvp.
---
I sure did. The Calculations was around what I was expecting. Cheers.
---
The fact that they’re clearing this as level 30s proves how much of a face roll classic is going to be unfortunately 😔
---
TOO LOW TERRAIN
---
Normal speed

---
Uhhh is this really even close to accurate?
---
People in this subreddit are dumb. This is a huge thing and needs to be addressed by blizzard immediately. Good find.
---
I just loved so much that certain pve gear is viable in endgame pvp. It was amazing to come up with the best armor set combinations and using the most OP  trinket in a regular battleground
---
Y u no heirloom?! /kick. /s
---
Blood craze is 3% over 6 seconds, it's really meh
---
yeah we really need someone to go hit up a target dummy with 2 hunters because there are so many variables during this run.   
---
There was another group running with rogues and druids (who were apparently sub-par specced and its expected  melee missing their white damage more often) and they were in the realm of 30 dps. The hunters were sitting above 100 dps reliably I believe - and spiking as high as 180 ish. Combined with the 2 hunters marks on the mob portrait - it seems suspicious, no?
---
Any reason why it's the biggest pain in the ass to find how to DL them or even see them in a big screen? Steam is a pain rn, keeps getting stuck when I'm trying to add to my collection, no idea how any of this works... Even then, great great work, love how you did themes, and went into the secret places (deadmines one is so tight) but any chance you'd do more "simple" ones like just Elwynn with trees, murlocs in the background close to the inn or something? I love having more nature than NPC's :)
---
Each person had a different Rank Hunters Mark. The mechanic had level 4 and Zeroed Had level 5 this bug seems to persist on a few spells right now.  Since the mark buffs all ranged attacks the Higher level mark should overwrite the lower one.   Could be a visual bug but i dont think so right now.
---
Oh man he streamed himself playing through Sekiro and then the Dark Souls games about a month ago and it was so funny.
---
I love guild banks and it was great when they added it in TBC.
---
But that answers the question there - it was in TBC and therefore has no place in Classic WoW. #NoChanges
---
I think if you just manage to keep your weapon level worthy you'll be fine.
---
They might not drop linen right there, but certainly once you are out of the starting area. The leper gnomes are a good target as well
---
He's not the only person that's said they've received an invite  without being subbed. Whether the quote is you need an active sub to play or receive an invite at all isn't exactly specified. Personally I think it's just you need an active sub to play/try beta.
---
Haha yeah sorry I retract, but you could be a bit more sympathetic with your answer
---
As shit, you're right.
---
But lets be real. 4.20 is so much better to read.
---
Unless you are like me and love filling in 5 forms + decleration of good behavior and no criminal record.
---
They already confirmed no to unarmored mounts
---
don't look a gift horse in the mouth
---
No one care about stupid streamers.
---
You're right about only using some keys, the shift and ctrl modifiers will help with that, I was just noting when you change stance your entire action bar changes so you could keep your modifier keys for global abilities and use the action bar for stance specific abilities bound to 1,2,3,4,q,e,f,x,v
---
Zalgradis. A paladin legend!
---
"Those who love to win" I mean it's in the guide.
---
I played a hunter in vanilla and I'm pretty certain they didn't. That would lead to an all hunter dps meta, no? I remember we had 1 hunter spec imp mark and they marked everything.
---
Gear like this is part of what made Vanilla so great. It was hard as hell to get and broken as fuck lol.

#**MAGTHERIDON**
---
I'm looking for anyone who played on US - Magtheridon, during any point in vanilla.  We have a discord server going, this is a community advertisement. Our community is primarily Horde based, but alliance pigdogs are also welcome.
---
Specifically looking for Tsumo the shaman, from the guild Requiem. Joho requests your presence.
---
Please leave a comment or message me for an invite.
---
This is actually the same guy posting the same thing over and over in every thread. his name is zaiman or something like that. i'm too lazy to go look for it but he was just spamming it everywhere.
---
The vampiric embrace is good for the group. But the +% shadow debuff they put on the mob is the most important for warlocks shadow bolt. Debuff limit restricts their desirability beyond a single spriest.
---
AB release date. I hope they decide to release it at the same time as WSG and AV.
---
useless comment with shit attitude.

---
That's my thought. These are 5 dudes who are close to BiS for level 30 and are completely coordinated and experienced with their class and people are saying Classic will be so easy. Sigh.
---
Sort of diverting the thread, Esfand and a lot of other people have a misunderstanding about Judgment. It is not hitscan like fireblast. Judgment is actually a projectile spell like Frostbolt, but it's real fast and the origin point is around 5 yards above the target's hitbox. This FELT instant back in the day and AFAIK it was implemented to be hitscan in basically every private server. BUT IT'S NOT, IT'S A PROJECTILE STOP BLAMING SPELL BATCHING FOR TRAVEL TIME.
---
Imagine misspelling retarded
---
One of the moons disappeared some time during vanilla, likely due to a bug. Most people are saying it was sometime before patch 1.12.1. The second moon was added again sometime during a later expansion. As I've seen a few people ask whether or not there are two moons in the beta, I decided to post this.
---
Thanks for the link, that's some cool lore!
---
From watching some streams of the BETA, assuming nothing changes, it looks as though dungeon XP may be pretty good so assuming you have a balanced trio (ie tank healer dps) you could feasibly power through some levels by dungeons only... Just a thought.
---
They mentioned the Hunter's Mark stacking bug, not sure if any of them reported it.
---
But that's not the reason those hunters did so much damage, it's because Hunters do not have glancing blows like melee and their autoshots calculate like Yellow (ability) damage of melee. Also they specced into 3% Hit and had lvl 32 pets.
---
They did not.  Source: I was the hunter who had to spec improved hunters mark and mark the targets in raids for the extra AP.
---
You'll see soon enough.
---
prob. their opinion on what happens after phase 6. I don't want any new content or any expansions. Even if they seperate classic and TBC/ Wotlk servers it will split the classic community and tear apart guilds and friends.
---
M’dew bottle
---
Happens all the time with mobs at least my level in classic.
---
If the community is strong on having them they might change their mind. The problem is that casual players don't really care but anyone who is "hard core" does want them.
---
gl, i hope you get in!
---
maybe they were upset but if people could listen into me and my friends chatting with eachother during raids and shit you would think we were mortal enemies, but it's all in good fun.
---
I was looking for these two comments. I only remember it working for humanoids as well.
---
Yeah there were a lot of variables which is why I asked if it had been tested on a target dummy yet and confirmed
---
Locks were lower damage early on, yes, but caught up a bit in AQ/Nax and provided a lot of utility.
---
They seemed pretty firm on it when they were asked in an interview. They said they don’t want to have anyone feeling like they need to rush to 60
---
#nochanges
---
No problem, what class/spec will you be playing?
---
We will have to see. I leveled a priest in Vanilla in about 5.5 days /played. Most of my toons were around 8-10 prior.
---
I suspect I will play about 24 hours every 2 weeks. So it will take me about 20 weeks to level to 60. That is about what the estimate gave me.
---
I do think it's a bit more on the cautious side. Fun roll though
---
A couple of dungeons that you have several quests for should be fine. If you’re alliance, for example, I’d say deadmines and scarlet monastery are worthwhile too, but be picky about groups, because you don’t want to spend hours wiping.
---
I levelled a warrior to 60 entirely in the month of January this year and I was fucking around a bit, BGs, most dungeons etc.
---
The fact they’re asking for 59 makes it a little less demanding too, that takes a few hours off of any of the levelling estimates that are based on times for 1-60
---
"spec for arms or fury (or both)"
---
ah, the good old 31/0/31
---
But if I get the sword of a thousand truths I can melee weave for the mana steal ;)
---
Right but what happens when a paladin fights a warlock? Based on the description it’s like an unstoppable force meets and immovable object
---
No? They can’t even use it, they can’t dual wield
---
The most OP duel spec.
---
Estimate of 3.2 months playing a shaman at normal speed and 25 hours a week. I think I'll go slightly faster than that, but I was thinking it would take me 2.5-3 months this time.
---
Can I get that combat text and font in a mod, please.
---
I dont know bro, I can pick my undies off the ground with my toes and flick them into the laundry bin.
---
This is the magic of the Vanilla economy.
---
Making 10g on sales at lvl 25 or 100g in sales at lvl 40, doesn't compare with making 200k gold in sales in retail. Making gold in Classic might seems harder, but it's not. It does require more time investment, in alts, but the principle is the same.
---
But, as I said, its much more satisfying in making a sale in Classic than retail. Another reason why I can't wait for Classic to hit.
---
Old AV : But I'm pretty sure they can't, because they don't actually have the old version to go from.
---
Hamstring Kiting with a slow weapon makes it where you can kill 3-4 mobs before having to eat
---
&gt; They said they don’t want to have anyone feeling like they need to rush to 60
---
Cool. Have them available indefinitely then - instead of not at all.
---
Problem is: there is no money in the server yet at launch, so even if you farm tons of mats, no one has the gold to buy them from you.
---
No matter what you do, you need time. Just mine, herb, skin, produce whatever until you have enough gold before leveling to 40.
---
On the other hand, if you rush 40 in a few days there is no way to get the gold without investing the time.
---
Awful, Holy Shield is garbage against anything except for Feral Druid, Rogue and Warrior, assuming they dont have a Shaman or Priest with them. Also, those are 3 classes Paladin performs well against anyway, so theres little point in countering them harder. With a 1h your dps is near nil, so youll be forced into a more grinding healer focus, which at that point, youre a Holy Paladin anyways.
---
Reckoning is worthwhile for a few specs, but you get that to be more offense orriented and is quite the opposite of becoming more tanky.
---
WoTF is useful on quite a few bosses in raids. It’s not a huge deal, but it’s not “nothing for PvE” and will save your life / help you top charts on several fights.
---
Hunters have unique jobs such as raid pulling, pet micromanaging, mob kiting (think of mobs that 2 shot you, now never get hit by them in a small tunnel while keeping enough aggro that it doesn't jump on your healers and do this for 2mins straight).  Also Rhokdelar quest was a super fun skill check.  Most other classes don't have these unique experiences.
---
Not saying other classes are easy
---
Engineering is an absolute money sink. Mining and skinning would make you much more.
---
Ooh cant wait for ZG!
---
Especially in starting zones, if you ran to a different one than your origin. You won’t find a bow quest reward until &gt;20 in Dwarf or Human areas, which means nelf hunters who ran there need to buy upgrades from vendors.
---
Oh man it has been years since I heard Sessler's voice. I used to  watch xplay whenever it was on. Even the reruns
---
Don't underestimate 10 shadow resistance. It could help out in one of your worst 1v1 matchups: Warlock.
---
5/27 -&gt; 8/27 = 2 months????
---
Very true. i have a week off. But i don't think ill get to 40 in a week like i said i never played Private servers only info i got is Streams and my 10yr memory. So ill be taking my time enjoying the time!
---
I mean for a shaman it is a noodle. Let's not pretend a shaman is in the group with the main tank unless he is shuffled in there to mana tide the mt healers.
---
Yes, you need 4 bosses and they rotate every few weeks. They also drop 1-3 charms on each kill. Realistically you must assume you can only get 4 or so trinkets per full rotation.
---
Druids and Priests obviously get the trinkets first, since they will use it for PvE for the entire game. After that it's up to the guild to decide who should get it. Rogues often want one, as do Hunters, and occasionally Mages for the 50% arcane damage crit multiplier (Arcane Explosion)
---
https://invidio.us/watch?v=8X_Ot0k4XJc
---
The vast majority of retail players also aren't good enough to powerlevel so they'll still be going incredibly slow.
---
Mages will generally not be receiving fear ward. It can only be up on 1 target at a time per dorfpriest - which isn’t something you’re guaranteed to have a lot of.
---
It’s all relative as well, wotf is useful on horde because everyone else will be feared and running into fire while you’re still casting n chilling.
---
Engi will only consume money, if your main goal is to make money then engi is a bad choice for that stage.
---
Who needs more than one weapon when it Slams ya with 3 fat crits in .5 seconds lmao.

Classic pvp uses WAY more buttons than retail. The entire game isn’t raids.
---
Oh snap really. is BlackSmithing ok? since i'd be a Warrior or if straight money i know herbs get money. is mining and herb a thing?

And this is a lie, semi-hardcore and better guilds looking to optimize their performance will use holy/weaver priest instead.

---
Making TBC later. 
---
I hated that they added flying to the game &amp; raised the level cap to 70 making all the 60 raid gear obsolete. But more than that, I'm worried it'll split the Vanilla servers popularity up too much.
---
&gt; Close the end of Legion I run out of fucks to give about the direction the game now has, so I just quit...and for the 1st time ever, since Vanilla, last august I didn't bought the a WoW expansion. It was weird but I was not enjoying myself that much so I decided it was the best option...but I don't hate the game, in fact I love it and I wish I could still enjoy it daily, I am just "sad" the direction it took but I don't pretend to assume its a bad direction, maybe it was the best concerning the modern market and demographics? Its just not for me so I parted ways with it.
---
For the most part that is basically how I feel, though I didn't even make it to the end of Legion. That being said, I continued and probably will continue to buy each expansion. While I am on the "BFA is shit" train, I'm not going to pretend like I didn't have fun for the first month. Each expansion offers at least a month of fun at launch, imo. After that point, you really start to see how bad the game is (to us) and it starts falling apart. 
---
The introduction of completely RNG loot and Mythic+ really solidified it for me personally. I play Mage for the most part and in Legion especially, you HAD to run crit, you needed over 60% crit or you were just complete garbage. The problem I had was no matter how many Mythic+ I ran, no crit gear would drop. I kept getting int gear with every other stats, which might as well have been str gear at the start of Legion. If I even got gear at all, it gimped the fuck out of my dps. I rolled Druid and Hunter for BFA to avoid that trap again, but it still got old being forced through dungeons as fast as possible. I'm all for aiming to go as fast, I don't want to RP walk through dungeons, but being forced to do that really ruins the experience in its own way.
---
I rambled for a bit there, but I guess what I am saying is that if you didn't hate Legion, BFA is basically the same shit. If you got any enjoyment out of it, you could easily get a month of enjoyment out of BFA before you start hating it too. I am just ready for Classic and to have old school loot treadmill back in dungeons. Mythic+ really is disgusting to me. If I want to play Diablo 3 I'll just go play Diablo 3.
---
I used to play arenas in WotLK with [Jewel of Kajaro](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19601/jewel-of-kajaro).
---
Losing 20 levels worth of stats on the neck was bad, but basically everyone I faced fully relied on addons telling them my Counterspell is still on cooldown. 
---
"I can lazily cast this heal, I still have 2 seconds until he can interrupt me, no problem."
---
Best feeling in the world imagining their confused faces. It won us quite a couple of arenas.

---
Really necessary / 10
---
I don't remember how long BRD took to clear at 60 but it's a very long instance, so at 2 hours per clear thats 20 ingame days you spent just running brd over and over?
---
It holds up. It's terrible and expensive.
---
I've been in one percent guilds that didn't have the arbitrary and elitist mindset and application process.  It took maybe an extra month to clear the raids, but I'd rather hang out with chill people than douchebags trying to flex their PvE dicks.
---
This is hugely inaccurate. A decent player following a guide playing 4-5 hours a day will ding 60 in 2-3 months your calculations out it at 8-9 months... Lol
---
I know some might consider this a stretch, but honestly BfA isn't that far off from being good. It does some things well. It's just that what it does poorly happens to be pretty damn important. I genuinely believe their Azerite gear idea fell apart and that caused a ripple effect of failures.
---
1: There is something to be said for playing on an official Blizzard server. You know there won't be shady business going on
---
2: When a game is free to play, there is often even more toxicity.
---
3: A lot of people have trouble convincing their friends to play bootleg. Even if it's easy, there have been people who improperly download the client and have their ISP email them about illegally obtaining the client. Some would rather not risk a strike with their ISP.
---
4: When Blizzard servers are up (Even in beta phase) for a lot, it diminishes the desire/need to play on a private server.
---
The point is more you use every spell in your arsenal... And also most classes can and do respec between high end content.   My best pvp spec isn't my raid spec.  Sitting on one spec post 60 is normally limiting your potential.... Unless your a fury warrior then you can tank raid, dps, and pvp... Zz
---
Because they are inaccurate?
---
Soda's group was able to do it without the bug so I'm sure Asmond's would too. Didn't seem all that difficult for people who knew what they were doing.
---
I know rets get memed on around here but honestly a ret paladin with gear can do pretty crazy damage.. they still have all the utilities that holy paladins have too.
---
P4 though. So you're 2 entire phases behind the release of the honor system, and 1 release late of WSG and AV. :(
---
How did you sprint to the dwarven district if you are a warrior
---
That's what the beta is for no? The players are the internal test team.
---
Same with blacksmithing but not as bad. Any profession that is not a gathering skill (mining, herbalism, skinning, and fishing) is going to cost you while leveling. Materials and recipes cost you mount money. 
---
On a new server, my first character gets two gathering skills and fishing. I level and auction everything I can. A lot of leather might get vendored but that is ok because every beast nets you extra coins from their leather. 
---
You can't mine an herb but that's ok
---
Why does everyone hate layering. Mind giving me some reasons as to why you think layering is bad?
---
You’d honestly rather not be able to play at all for the first week and just sit in a queue of 10k+ ppl to log in, rather than have layering?
---
Blacksmithing is  good on warrior just so you don't have to pay other people to make you endgame gear lol. Arcanite reaper and Lionhardt helm are really fucking expensive to get people to make.
---
&gt;but it's a very long instance, so at 2 hours per clear
---
No, because you never do full clears. You do Lavaruns, which means skipping every pack up to Incendius (Mobs are level 52), then lavajump to MC entrance.
---
All you need to clear is the Lyceum ( takes under 5min with a tank that knows where to los the packs), and Magmus, and the final room before Emperor. All in all the run takes a total of 15-20 min from opening the first gate near the entrance.
---
Had a fella chase me across a zone to try and kill me, as soon as he attacked, I let him get me to ~10-15% and bubblehearthed back to the start of the zone.
---
I don't care that i wasted my time running, I care that he wasted his time trying to be annoying against a lower level player.
---
(It was in legion, I was level 105ish, he was 110, so he wanted easy honor)
---
&gt; the only reason this worked is because hunters ignore glancing blows, parries, and dodges. still cool tho
---
Its true, thats why I had a fit when people on the main forums cried that its too easy if they cleared cath... Im like, they had to bring hunters to even land hits because of the way arrows aren't parried or dodged man...
---
It takes some serious finessing of game mechanics to make this work.

Gives you plenty of time to put in favors for your guild in return for dibs on the charms.

You won't get a Mail if you are invited to the Beta. I have Beta-Access since a Week and I never got a Mail.
---
No most Rogue weapons Will have too low AS till benefit from kiting
---
Also losing dps by not using instant posion
---
Nice, maybe you’ll get close to half of all keybindings for a lock with that setup.
---
I mean who else has tested SM at this point?  Also they found and filed a bug report on 2 hunter's marks stacking.  Most people might not have found that because they aren't running a 2 hunter comp for normal content.
---
What race do you think is better for horde ? UD for devouring plague or troll for berserking
---
If you wanna break your head without addons, go ahead and play without addons, why try to keep the rest from using them lol
---
Haha, all of Stature of the Gods felt like royalty to me back then :D
---
Kind of goes along the lines of what I said. Group up and align with people who have the same viewpoint as you. The casual guilds might not even make it to bwl but they’ll be having a great time clearing what they can. I spent my time in vanilla in a pretty crappy casual guild. I didn’t know any better at the time but it’s clear when I look back now.  I just played to have a good time with my guild. We didn’t have near optimal specs but has a great time working through zg, ony and mc. Some people just don’t care about min maxing and just play for fun. All this content has been cleared before, there’s so many guides out any casual guild will be able to follow and succeed.
---
I miss the rain in the bonus screenshot 2. Lots of dynamic fog/mist in addition to rain droplets. 
---
Classic beta right now has heavy rain drops, but the “mist” is like the smoke in Dwarven District: static, same opaqueness throughout, applies to the enter field of view.
---
PvE server: Yes you can finish everything by yourself. How LONG i will take you depends on your skill as a player and the class you play, and how distracted you get from questing (Like gathering stuff or exploring, or sitting around a dungeon entrance waiting for a group)
---
PvP server: It's possible, but you will be ganked at some point. You will be corpse camped at some point. That is the nature of PvP server, you deal with it or you get some friends/roll on a PvE server. This significantly slows down your solo play and in some cases will eventually force you you find friends.
---
For guilds, You'll be invited at random (pot-luck if its a good guild. Most of them are just mass recruiting to see what sticks).  
---
You can browse forums or other social sites (like reddit or whatever) and look up recruiting posts.
---
You can read the /general or the /recruitment chats of guild posters (In vanilla people were actually pretty good at keeping most 'spam' in their appropriate channels. General chat was pretty loose and most people posted requirements once every 5 minutes or so, because guild spammers were frowned upon. At least that was my experience)
---
You can also head over to this discord:  [https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq](https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq) its a discord for guilds and players to link up. You can also chill and just chat.
---
For classes: Its up to you what you think "Looks and feels cool". If the sound and look of a mage is cool, pick mage. If the sound or look of a paladin is cool, pick paladin. Every class has their pro's and con's and most people look at them for their end-game (raiding or cap-level PvP) potential.
---
take your time, and enjoy the game. As you should with every game you interact with.
---
Even this is better than the current situation. Or even for like 2 phases which is enough time for a dedicated casual player get the mount.
---
In the grand scheme of content progression, April is still pretty early to jump on the endgame bandwagon. That’s probably within a month or so of BWL release so everyone will still be in MC gear and easy to catch up to, especially since Maraudon and Dire Maul will be available to speed up pre-raid gearing. People will be dinging 60 all throughout classic, so believe me, a few months later - let’s say by the time of AQ release - you’ll be a god relative to the people who are just hitting 60 then, for whatever reason. Even those people won’t have a hard time gearing, most guilds will be running MC on farm every week, and ZG will be out to bridge the gap even more.
---
Not every player who joins classic will be playing from launch day so that’s already an advantage for any of us who are.
---
&gt; I dont even know where should i find a guild or other players to play together.
---
Most easily by playing the game. A lot of the content requires group play, and if you do that, being cordial and not a complete wanker will see you put on friend lists, which then means that you'll get whispers about doing group activities from people you already played with. If you do those (even in cases that are not immediately beneficial to you), you'll build a reputation as a solid, dependable and nice player. And that'll see to it that sooner or later, you'll get a guild invite.
---
&gt; And where can i find a good guide about pve so i didnt miss some content
---
I personally would not worry about that. You do not *need* to do all the content on one character. In fact, one thing that elevates Classic above later expansions is that a lot of stuff is purposely hidden to make the game world seem that much bigger (there's a sense of there always being something out there that's left to discover). In fact, as someone who was there for the EU launch, my heartfelt suggestion is to go in blind and explore Azeroth without a guide. Later expacs provide that guiding line to everything, and it's a big reason why the current live version, in my estimate, sucks donkey balls.
---
Some more highlights over the past couple days
---
It does also require getting attuned with MC, Onyxia and Azshara Hydraxian Waterlords quest chain up to the MC part. So at least a weekend to get the attunements.
---
Check out [Vanilla Friends](https://www.vanillafriends.com)
---
People can just replicate it in those random test servers, no? Would be cool to see.
---
I like trolls but for devouring plague I roll ud. Troll better for pve i think.
---
Awww man thats a tough one, I probably wont actually decide until I have to... keeping in mind I probably wont ever get in heavy enough for raid content, Im in between:
---
Warrior/fury
---
Pally/not sure
---
Hunter/BM
---
Druid/Feral
---
Are you sure it's your PC that's 32 bit and not just the operating system (windows I assume) ?
---
How old is it? It's been several years that PCs are all 64 bit, but Windows took quite a long time to adapt to it.
---
I'm sorry that they forgot your only other role: Tranq shot :(
---
Not the kind of leashing we're talking about and you know it.
---
layer hopping exploits, players phasing in/out all over the world.
---
all the benefits of layers hinge on blizzard being correct that everybody quits the game right away so they can seamlessly remove layers.  only guarantee that layers will be gone by phase 2 is blizzards word which isn't worth dirt
---
Troll: Berserking is not that important for Shadow, but it’s quite good if you end up healing (which you will). Both racial spells are great in PvP, Shadowguard is spammable, deals decent damage with good scaling and can proc Blackout, Hex of Weakness is a spammable MS debuff.
---
Undead: Shadow Resistance can be a small bonus in raids, WotF has its uses for a few encounters and is great in PvP. Curse of Weakness is useful as an extra buff in PvP as a dispel protection and might trigger Blackout. Devouring Plague is easily removed in larger scale fights, but can be great in 1v1 encounters, it’s expensive though.
---
Quite different choices with different advantages.
---
Too basic. not enough tusks, horns, and dead stank.
---
Yes and no by the time 1.12 came out dps/swing normalization has been implemented. This is why the arcanite reaper was so godly. Because it has the slowest swing and hardest hitting and thus allowed for harder abilities hit. However in 1.12 that is no longer the case. Also windfury was nerfed into the ground in 1.12 where duel wield is technically better because r3/r2 don’t share the same ICD (3sec) proc timer.
---
What if he has a PHONE?
---
Balancing school, "work", dating and raiding at 15?
---
I adore how you try to make it sound like such a feat just for the dramatic impact your story should have. We were all teenagers once, it isn't such a big deal...
---
Let the poor woman play a night elf and run Horde with your friends.
---
Sure. Two kids though and I teach karate 3-4 hours 3 nights a week after work.
---
I wait until they kill the mob and then sit down and drink for that sweet 100% crit ambush
---
Yes you will. [I got a mail](http://puu.sh/Dy1DM/90f1c3bd1a.png)
---
lolprot
---
Me with windfury
---
The worst downside of a warrior is that you're completely hopeless in pvp until 60 and geared, which takes 6-10+ days played, and playing vanilla for end game content is a questionable pleasure. Also, from what  i've seen, leveling feels even slower than on pservers post qexp fix, so expect 10+ levels of pure grind, which is mind-boggling as warrior. Hamstring kite doesn't work either.
---
I did hundred of runs too and never saw it drop.
---
Im heavily in favour of guild banks to prevent account sharing which is against i believe the ToS.
---
As such I believe it only proper they are introduced to prevent guilds being driven to share accounts between the leadership to handle guild banking.
---
It's not just about tagging mobs, it's about the servers not crashing and burning.
---
People want to actually play at launch, not only would the queue be disgustingly massive but the people playing the game wouldn't have a good experience, and this is only gonna be for the first month or so.
---
Get over it dude.
---
I'll eat downvotes for it, but I don't get the harm in making shitty specs like Ret not shitty.
---
Keep all the good specs, fine. But when hardcore guilds are just stacking Warlock, Mage and Fury Warriors in raids, and some specs barely if even getting to come (Balance) isn't there a problem?
---
I'd love if ret, balance, shadow, disc, etc were buffed. Instead of it seeming like each class has one viable spec, potentially two if you're Warrior / late game Mage.
---
Respec when you raid or join a guild that cares more about having a good time than being meta.
---
Irrelevant since OP put ironfoe (a mace) in the pic.
---
People don’t know well enough not to buy gear, if they think it’s a deal they’ll buy it.
---
So you’d rather not play the game at all in the first month?
---
Layering isnt going away. If its a deal breaker, then dont play. 
---
You dont have any clue was the exploit possibilities will be, because we dont have enough information about layering, or what the final version of layering entails. So voice your concerns, but they are not going to get rid of it altogether.
---
You are right. Lets cut the sleep to a bare minimum for human survival. Worth it to enjoy the game to the fullest!
---
What's the point of this post? Blizzard have made a decision, end of. Don't like it? Then don't play it.
---
Rentaki's Charm of Trickery
---
It's a temporary compromise. You're just going to have to live with it.
---
Well this is worthless. Also, private servers have been using the exact same addons for years.
---
I think streamlined is a more proper word than simplified :p
---
Sell them Bronze tubes!
---
This has a ton of spelling errors
---
I’ve expected some karma-whoring virtue-signal story about being decent to some new players, but what I’ve got was capitalism at its finest. It’s great to see there is some hope for the people on this site.
---
&gt;However I also think that a lot of people don't give games the chance they deserve.
---
This makes me remember Wildstar. I think it deserved a better chance. Some shitty optimization on AMD CPU's during it's beta got it a bad reputation but it's PvE was incredible and challenging.
---
Because ya moms a hoe
---
Rogue with this trinket and thistle tea could regen all their energy twice over
---
That’s a lot of tickles
---
warlock gm sounds like an uprising waiting to happen
---
1) its for the first few weeks (gone by phase 2 at the latest) - if stress test is anything to go by, rest assured you will be fighting for mobs. - people will be fighting for tidal charm for the entirety of classic, relax.
---
2) I'd be impressed if you have 100 people high enough level too raid said flight masters and towns ..
---
3-4) who cares, these people will be in the minority, if it ends up breaking cost of block lotus, i will just hoard some for when layering is gone :)
---
5) so you want constant server crashing like the original release ? with it being completely unplayable for weeks ? nice.
---
I really find beta hitboxes to suck and still get attacked from questionable distances.
---
Because as far i know, Blizzard doesn't accept bribe from chinese and russian to allow them to gold selling and stealing gold by hacking account on the server.
---
And blizzard wont spawn R14 geared players out of nowhere for real money (at least i hope lol).
---
On private server there is always a suspicion, about instance ID, world boss respawn timer, gold given to "friend" to help them in progression etc.
---
I played on private server it was fun, but seriously i prefer to pay 15$ and be sure none is getting favored.
---
Whhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
That is literally what leashing is... I'm not sure what you're talking about if you're not talking about leashing.
---
Would you rather be the only 100-man guild on your server and everyone else, including everyone from the other faction, no longer be playing at all? Sounds fun!
---
There is too much hype around vanilla wow right now ... everyone and their brother is going to make a character to "check it out" ... layering is not intended to avoid an annoying launch. It's intent is to avoid shit-ball unhealthy lopsided or even empty servers a year from now (when, I am guessing 60-70% of the people who played at launch stop logging in regularly).
---
Classic has two things going for it that will make server health very hard to maintain. 1) It is an oddity (people will want to try it out) ... 2) It is niche (most people will not enjoy it long-term). That's not a good combo.
---
Thus concludes this week's episode of "Layering: A Necessary Evil" ......
---
I have no idea if our class Synergy is any good. We will problably play mage/warlock, paladin/priest and a hunter. Atleast we will die way less than being alone
---
"I 'm banned from the classic wow forums for voicing my concerns on layering/sharding"
---
Something tells me that is not the case.
---
Dude you are so toxic. Of course ele shamans can heal in 60 dungeons. This isn't bfa mate. You normally go into resto tree. 60 raids are different but dungeons? Nah you're just shit if you think it's not possible.
---
Honest question: why? For me, I only need enough gold to get gear; my mount; every day necessities like flight path fees, respecs, and repairs; and consumables for PvP/PvE. As long as I can afford all that, I'll be content.
---
The only way to make a game truly balanced is if you made only 1 class with 1 spec. That's no fun.
---
It they tried buffing bad classes it would make too big of a change. Besides 1.12 is already balanced enough. You can play any class even in end game.
---
Well if it an old Nokia, then good. Those things were like tanks.
---
Just lost myself for a good 10 minutes on that archived post, good read \^\^ I really like how the old look of the site is still preserved too.
---
Still keyboard turns
---
Is there a combo point tracking mod for classic? I dislike the old style where you only see it on the health bar of the enemy you have hit.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19954/renatakis-charm-of-trickery
---
Guess reddit is where you can autistically screech freely but it's happening and the best you can hope for is they take these 3 months and make layering the least intrusive they can
---
No... He has an "enrage" when he hits 10% health, that's probably what you are thinking about
---
Good thing there is no rush to pvp.
---
Focusing on pvp 10 months after the honor system is just as fun as focusing on pvp the same day it releases.
---
lol okay, when the server has 5000 tidal charms instead of the 60 it was intended go revisit your post
---
Honestly that would be incredibly entertaining to see. Imagine how long it would take twitch to level 1-60, even on a hunter. It would probably take a whole realm's lifecycle, but it'd get there eventually :D
---
Should be banned from here as well for making these dumb threads.
---
NPCs in later expansions have a set distance they can't be pulled past their spawn point no matter how often you damage them. World bosses _only_ have this kind of leashing in vanilla.
---
You don't think Blizzard will crack WAY down on pservers once Classic launches?
---
Mithril casing is also needed for a quest in Ungoro. There are some others, but been too long.
---
My email was revived a full 48 hours after I got access.
---
Also, you most likely will not get in *now* as Blizzard has stated that they have the beta population they need.
---
? It’s a main hand weapon. Ironfoe is Better than a 2 Hand for shamans. It’s bis until naxx I believe. 
---
If you windfury or iron foe proc you have 3 chance to proc the other. It makes 5 attack procs happen fairly often.
---
To each their own I guess. I just want to be one of the rich players on my server the same way people want to be one of the best geared players.
---
Thank you for your concern firedropx. I am sure it is noted by Blizzard but without a large set of data, we players, do not know how it will impact the day to day.  
---
I am sure you and the one hundred guildies will be stomping out flight masters as soon as you are able to at 60.
---
What do you mean Warlock? Clearly uses 'Fire and Cold' ;o
---
5000? Holy hyperbole batman
---
Yeah blood rage is supposed to keep you in combat. It’s not a bug
---
Not going to lie, I lost around three girlfriends to my wow addiction. I regret noting.
---
my friends and I made a good amount of gold selling mc attuments with my warlock. me and 2 others would go to dungeon and do the sneaky way to get to it. We could 3 man the elementals we had to fight thanks to banish.
---
Then stay at the item needed for the quest. a 4th would be at the quest giver to take the gold and invite to the group and a fifth not in the group would advertise in the main cities we are doing this.
---
Once someone got the quest and paid they would be invited to the group, i would summon, and boom they got their attumentment to mc. So many peoples alts paid for us to do that. Would have been better with 3 warlocks in the dungeons to have more shards but hey it worked and we made...... fair money. Splitting it five ways cut into it, but i did got a small bonus since i had to farm the shards.
---
Yes... but that's not what we're talking about. I'm confused as to how you responded to me in the first place and now you're telling me "well that's not what we're talking about" I WAS HERE FIRST, MAN!
---
Anyone who can ring the gong within 10 hours of the first to do it get it.
---
Let me gues you had the same mentality when blizzard was making bfa, look how that ended.
---
damn apologists
---
ZG is just a really well designed raid. It's accessible, gives well itemized loot, and has cool/fun drops.
---
Yeah I want to print this... I really do, but you can't un-see those errors once you notice them.
---
I disagree xD but each to their own
---
Shamans didnt have dual wield in 1.12. They got it in TBC.
---
Absolutely false. Any semi-hardcore guild or above will not be taking a Balance Druid. That's the issue at hand.
---
If you play ret, you're playing in a casual guild even if you play 40+ hours a week unless you have a generous raid leader/friend.
---
How the hell is a game balanced when half the specs in the game suck ass at end game? That makes.. No sense.
---
And your statement alone is diminished, because Warrior especially has two viable specs. Mage as well when you switch to Fire later on in raids.
---
By all means, don't play because of layering, it'll improve the community to have one less whiner.
---
0/10 he still needs to alt + tab to check thottbot
---
This is why you masterloot on the last boss
---
&gt;  it was, and I suppose still is, against ToS
---
It is indeed still against the TOS, that's why people are asking for guild banks even if they're well aware it affects gameplay.
---
"Hillsbrad Foolhills" hahahah
---
Just time constrained until the gate is open and lots of work

People seem to be forgetting that groups are not typically going to be as equip as they are. Most people leveling aren't going to farm out the BIS gear for level 30 and stay there. That is why they are able to even hit anything in there. 
---
Most people are going to be a mix of greens and blues, half of which are likely going to be from several levels ago by the time they get to 30. If you take any regular group of fresh level 30s they would get destroyed by that part of the dungeon. This will not happen in practice upon release. (Maybe all hunters and able to bounce threat perfectly, and CC'd well, maybe.)
---
Theres a difference between going slow because ur bad or going slow because you take your time. I agree with the first point, not with the second
---
if you want to play without queue pick a realm that isn't 10x full pop
---
I believe it's only one scarab lord per server

 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE Server - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking organized vacation/roster rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
**About Us:**
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players from Vanilla to Private Server to Retail. We’ve played many MMOs at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured. To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization. We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience. Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS. In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended. In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks. Please refer to the Charter at[ celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) for the napkin math behind this. We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience. Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.
---
Tuesdays: 6:00 –10:00 pm. PST
---
Wednesdays: 6:00 – 10:00 p.m. PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing an optional rotating raid attendance schedule. With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
**Loot:**
---
Pre-designated loot council (details in website Charter)
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are still recruiting for many positions. It should be noted that if you resonate with us but are unable to commit to our raid program we may be open to recruiting you as as non-raiding member. Such positions remain selective and are held to the same member expectations as everyone else.
---
If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building please refer to our website at[ celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) and read over the Charter. The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.
---
Thanks for reading. May you find your perfect guild!
---
8-9 days is when the average player would hit 60. Fast players can do it sub 7 and super fast is sub 6. Any player on any class with good preparation and only focused on leveling would hit 60 in 6 days or less, this includes Warriors.  
---
We all know that the vanilla world record sits sub 5 days but with all the information we have now you can expect classic speed runners to hit sub 4 days.
---
And VE right? :p
---
no you just do lava runs which are relatively fast.
---
The gnomes were just waiters and sex slaves in service to the drunken perverted dancing dorfs.
---
Yeah so i hear. How much do you think the reaper will cost? lol i mean if i somehow manage to get my mounts and roll around in the gold Eh fuck it IMO haha
---
Does this account for rested xp?
---
We were the first to clear on my server, it's a great raid cant wait to do it again.
---
lol yeah likely. It’s more likely he was slinging insults as well and in typical fashion pulls out the logical fallacies to make it sound like he was banned for something innocent.
---
Confirmed, big stick in your ass.
---
Ideally we would have multiple people of different levels (assuming max WS for their level) hitting the same target for a long time, so that we could pool the results to get a large sample size.  For every level being investigated, some testers would have the +5 racial.
---
Once Dire Maul is released we'll have the Gordok Spirits after the last boss in DM North.  They are level 60, so can be tested with players at levels 57-60.  They don't die or attack - they're basically target dummies - so they're perfect for extended testing periods.
---
Private servers were overtuned and not all that accurate an experience of vanilla
---
Probably a little more to your forum ban than just "voicing your opinion," but whatever. 
---
I played on the stress test and there was plenty of fighting over mobs going on
---
&gt; blood rage is supposed to keep you in combat.
---
and by that you mean +5 sec after the duration of bloodrage is over?   
---
I'm aware that Bloodrage should keep you in combat while its active.
---
Will it hurt leveling?
---
Just downvote and move on.
---
What is the point of this video if not to bypass this "hard" leashing which shouldn't be in vanilla?
---
No I did not.
---
People will stop playing though which splits communities anyway?
---
Are you able to swap out of this when its on cooldown? If you can this makes it pretty damn good when you can FD hot swap to another neck while its on CD
---
will the quest be available at launch, or at phase 4 when AQ drops? what kind of timeframe will there be to complete the quest?
---
Ok, harsh, but still laughed.
---
You are full of shit.
---
And [this](https://youtu.be/ZG5j9aFuxOI?t=48) particular scene xD
---
But what are you going to use the money for? Or are you just gonna "collect" gold? I'm not knocking your plan -  just curious. In later expansions there were ways to flaunt your money with rare items, pets, mounts, transmog stuff, etc. but in vanilla there wasn't much worth buying besides a few pieces of gear (many of which would be replaced by raid items) and consumables.
---
WoW is a true MMO. It requires other people to raid and has too much content for 1 character (if you try to complete every quest in a zone you will out level the mobs there and stop getting xp towards the end, or get very little xp)
---
If you want to play solo I suggest you roll through several alts and level them 1-60. Choose different races each time to get totally different content. Hell, go 1 horde and 1 alliance and get 2 totally different leveling experiences. You will make friends during the process and may decide to raid on one of them
---
You got him to the point of deleting his account, wtf lol
---
A shame it feels like they'll never be complete. Kinda feels like it started out as a short story and the author never really had plans to write in the rest of the story
---
The things that need adjusting in your grossly exaggerated example are not working out / sports, it’s the retarded amount of time spent sitting in a computer chair.
---
Only one of us actually has "tard" in his name, so..........
---
I ran UBRS non stop on my Feral druid trying to get the eye patch.
---
My friend logs on to my account to fuck around with my character and ends up getting suckered into tanking UBRS for my guild.
---
Guess what drops?
---
Mods can we get a ban for him on here too?
---
Are these two the only ones missing?
---
No it doesn't. I'm sure you put in daily hours into a box that asks for weekly hours. Reading helps. Here's the calculation for a Paladin on 5 hours a day following a guide:
---
 *A* **paladin** *is a slow leveling class. If you are playing an average of* **35 hours per week** *and your leveling speed is* **fast** *you will probably ding level 60 somewhere around...*
---
***Monday 14 October 2019***
---
*(this will be 1.6 months from when you start playing on 27 August 2019)*
---
I like the cut of your jib!
---
Time gating raids is bad? On what planet
---
Old AV, I started kinda late and only ever saw Lokholar summoned once. Never going to happen though.
---
It doesn't matter if your laptop is outdated, people playing the beta are reporting requirements are quite lower than retail.
---
You just have to replace your Windows with a 64bit version. Retail is 64bit only now and it's safe to assume IMO Classic will be too since it's based on the modern engine.
---
Actually in early BC you didn't need to take damage to regen mana, overhealing on you regenned mana too lol.  So the meme at launch was running holy pally + warrior tank, then 2x shadow priest and a mage.  With 2x shadow priests constantly overhealing (vampiric embrace wasn't on a cooldown back then) the pally could spam top rank heals on the tank and never go oom.
---
Alright, trying not to crush hopes, but it needs to be reiterated.
---
If you are not on the F&amp;F list or friends with a mega streamer who is trying to get you in, you shouldn't expect anything for the next few weeks. Even Friends &amp; Family aren't all in yet, and have been told despite being on the list, may not get in.
---
With the stress test this week, and the WoW Classic population not really lowering in game at all, you shouldn't expect an RNG Closed Beta wave for awhile.
---
It should be:
---
normal: 9 days
---
fast: 5-6 days
---
superfast: 4-5 days
---
&gt; I'm banned from the classic wow forums for voicing my concerns on layering/sharding, so I guess I'll post here.
---
No. No you didn’t. Here is what likely really happened: “You people are all fa***ts for not arguing against layering! Go f**k yourselves!”
---
Or something to that nature.
---
look, another retard that never even played wow in 2005 and has no clue what he's talking about
---
A single DoT in wotlk did not deal half a healthbar worth of damage. a blue geared shadow word pain will deal 2k damage. so whats your point here?   
---
and you can cast 10, not 5 shadow word pains before you are oom or close to be. and since you bring up consumables, that should add a couple more.    
---
it feels like you are just trying to prove me wrong by spitting out weird arguments all over the place and even getting personal. bring some facts and correct numbers and then we can have a discussion  
---
we can both agree that shadow priests have mana issues and struggle against healers, i already mentioned this in my first comment.   i gave him pros and cons to help him choose, and you have just put up misleading arguments and gotten personal with me.  maybe you should bring something to the table here since you clearly have the experience to do so.
---
I hate Quin
---
Actually it is going away. Only going to be implemented for the first few weeks. Confirmed will not be in phase 2. 
---
Source: interview with the heads of the project
---
Idk but a mate back then still used it in BC and he knew what he was doing. So I guess it was still op.
---
At this point you most likely will not get a beta invite. Blizzard stated last week that they have the beta population they need.
---
Its there to save the servers. This time its 14 years of accumulated players joining in all at once. Its going to boommm
---
Most retarded award goes to...
---
Ahh sorry you are correct haha my mistake. I even tried with Hunter etc and was wondering why it was saying 9 months to level makes sense why.
---
People are gonna be reminded how slow stealth used to be, when was that changed?
---
How many normal pvp servers do you think there will be. I highly doubt we will have the luxury of picking the “low pop pvp servers”
---
Right? I'm not doubting that. I'm merely stating that I think it would be a shame if the experience many of us have had over the last 10 years was tougher than the authentic experience we're looking forward to.
---
I think I could do it myself, but I don't know how you process those to become actual wallpapers. Like, I can turn the game on, record with OBS streamlabs with the game in perfect quality, record a minute of it, but what do I do with the video? if you have a guide on this it works too! I'm gonna find a way to access those too ^^
---
Really? What the hell :)
---
Well now we know why you got banned.
---
I can imagine its a bunch of warriors dominating with WW axe.
---
It won’t be available until the phase adding AQ. And the time frame from when the quest drops is how long it takes the server to finish the war effort and someone ringing the gong. There is no set time frame. It’s however long it takes on your server.
---
That 2v6 was insane
---
Go horde!
---
I’m doing the opposite because it’s always been horde and not that alliance, I’ve literally never made one character for the alliance. So I’m going alliance to experience WoW for the first time!
---
Ill take 2 please! :)
---
AHK and out of game scripting
---
You're right.. these memes are getting old.. they already said that not many invites will be going out now
---
I mean, hunters have to give up an entire bag just to attack.

---
i quit after BC and played private servers since
---
Asmongold and his party cleared it yesterday.
---
Devouring plague uses a *ton* of mana, it’s not as great as it sounds and is quite situational
---
I ordered one of those, it lasted like 1 month tops.
---
Chinese quality :/
---
Yeah, I'm all for a guild bank system. I dont see any cons to it besides **no changes**. Blizz has to know that people are going to have to come up with questionable, potentially rule bending solutions to meet the demand.
---
Dwarf for sure on ally. If you like pvp you probably want to go undead on horde. Though troll can actually destroy melee dps so hard in pvp.
---
&gt;Scaled really poorly
---
Druids have the highest scaling potential in the entire game. The healing coefficient of Healing Touch (amount of healing from gear added onto a cast) is 100% because it is a 3.5 second cast. Druids actually *scale* higher than other healers because the other classes' HT equivalent are 3.0s cast untalented which means they inherit approx 13% less bonus healing per cast. The base healing values of those spells are also significantly lower.
---
&gt;Healing gear
---
There are so many factors that play into what gear you wear, it's really dependant on what content you're doing, gear level, how quickly you're progressing and so on. Generally T1 is kind of garbage for PvE. 5 set T2 is very strong with Imp. Regrowth spec. Once you reach AQ40 you'll want to wear as much off-pieces as you can, and you either play Imp. Regrowth or Tranquil Spirit based on what gear is available to you.
---
&gt;Regrowth spec
---
There comes a time during AQ40 when you finally replace some of the worst holdover gear pieces from dungeons and you can finally sustain Imp. Regrowth spec for some of the longer fights. I'd personally switch out of 24/0/27 (Tranquil Spirit) once C'thun is on farm or once you have replaced some of the dungeon blues that you were stuck with throughout MC and BWL.
---
&gt;Need for HT spec in Naxxramas
---
Depends on your gear and the skill/gear level of your guild, and there's 3 distinct PvE Resto specs for Druids.  
---
Imp. Regrowth spec has higher HPS, Tranquil Spirit has higher mana efficiency and Swiftmend is rarely played. It all comes down to how quickly you run out of mana versus what is causing your wipes. If your raid is playing like absolute idiots and fumbling the mechanics then the issue isn't mana efficiency, it's your raid fucking up.
---
&gt;Resto Druids in 5 mans
---
Pretty amazing dungeon healers actually. Very little downtime, can handle a lot of pressure and sustain multiple group members with hots, rarely risk dying during runs thanks to barkskin tanking in bear form and cat form dash if they need to kite. The biggest downside is that they only have one resurrection every 30 minutes. You can alleviate that problem by being an engineer with goblin jumper cables (engineering is almost mandatory for everybody in classic). Also bringing along a Warlock is handy since if people have to corpse run you can summon them back to your group. Soulstone is rarely useful in Druid groups because they can't revive the group after a wipe.
---
I'm going to roll a Dwarf Priest as my main in classic, but my second character will be a NE Druid because I love the class. It has *many* problems but I still love the class. I plan on PvPing a lot in Classic and sadly Druids are a bit too one-dimensional in organized PvP for my liking. Flag running is a lot of fun, but the extra offense capability that Priests have means they have a much more versatile playstyle and experience a much more varied playstyle.
---
I've played every healing class at level 60 so feel free to ask any questions, although my knowledge of Shamans is limited because I ended up despising the totem mechanic.
---
Shit full of HK's.
---
One of the developers was streaming on twitch and mentioning how problematic flying was. He started kind of wondering aloud about a divergent development path for classic wow that doesn't make that mistake. I think it COULD happen if the game is popular enough.
---
how many layers do u think will be there?
---
My thoughts exactly. Need something 9:30pm+ pst.
---
There is still ~3 months of beta testing if beta runs right until launch.
---
I respect your opinion, but to me it just sucks that there are so many fucking useless end-game specs and I think it's disingenuous to tell people "Play what sounds fun." Because that alone may limit you from being a serious raider even if you no life the game.
---
I'd love for beta to add even small buffs to shit specs and use beta to test it out, and then no more tweaks once the game is live.
---
aww did someone upset the alt-left zoomer?
---
wait is that confirmed?
---
Oh neat, didn't know blizz would just be starting with 16 slots. I'm sure you will be able to find a guild that will use one. I was just speaking from exp mostly, I have not played priest, but I raided classic and most recently raided on 3 or 4 private realms. Even when the debuff slot went up, a lot of guilds didn't run a shadow priest until at least ZG because the gear is just not optimized for that spec. Regardless of shadow vulnerability. Fury wars and rogues crush a lot harder through MC content, thus why I was saying I bet you're asked to heal. But hey, I saw a guild that let a boomkin raid because they liked the guy. I applaud anything against the min/max norm, just speaking from what I saw.
---
Edit: didn't realize names of private servers weren't allowed ;-)
---
I'd rather have x number of layers at 3k cap a pop that eventually gets reduced to one layer than have no layers and a dead server after a month.
---
Man, this guild takes no prisoners!
---
MC attune is really easy, you knock it out in a BRD run
---
Ony attune is made out to be kind of long but the main meat of it is killing the dragonkin elites in burning steppes(?) and 2 BRD runs
---
If you’re smart about it, you’ll get the first 2 BRD parts of each chain before going in there for the first time, then you just need to run the escort for Ony and you’re good.
---
(Your guild is really making EVERY raid member get the quintessences? To what end?)
---
Actually back then, people reset the instance by inviting another player and making them the leader. or having them invite you.  you could relog out of the instance that way.  
---
I was playing a hunter back then, but i was very young and didnt get to do theese runs myself at that point (did on pservers), but i did watch videos of people doing it at the time.  i tried to find those videos today, but i found some 2006 comments that verified what i said above  
---
The maraudon farm was a thing back them, and it would never have been if you couldnt get out of the instance that way
---
Man, Warrior leveling is easy if you keep up your weapons to be good with dungeons and quest rewards. The real pain of playing a Wareior is when you hit 60 and you run BRD 50 times over and compete with Rogues and other Warriors over that 1% drop chamce on Ironfoe and Hand od Justice just to be shoehorned into playing a tank in raids anyway.
---
id voice my concern that there will be layering/sharding at the beginning, i dont like dead servers 2 months in :)
---
30s from when u equip until you can use it tho, ideally u start with on use trinkets and then feign swap to some static buff trinkets
---
Hi, /u/Knoxxyjohnville
---
I think contested areas are always pvp but in pvp servers everywhere is pvp enabled. Sorry I've only ever played pvp
---
Blizzard can’t balance PvE and PvP properly now (hence having damage auras) so I don’t have faith in them balancing an old game with a million odd items in 3 months. I get what you mean but not being able to be all things is part of the charm of Vanilla.
---
He's talking about the totem.
---
I feel like raids are going to be the main big wake-up call, like the vanilla tactics are simple AF in comparison to half the shit they have thrown at us WOTLK and beyond. I have a feeling even overtuned (original tuning) C'Thun is likely doable with people who are used to the modern WOW bosses. It's interesting that people consistently thought back to vanilla and how it was much harder. I remember it being tough but mainly because I had no idea how to spec, no idea how to build my character.
---
5/7
---
I love people telling blizzard they’re wrong with how they remade their own game. Esfand talked to private server devs some told him they weren’t sure about tuning and just guessed on shit lmao.
---
PVP is you are hostile at all points in the game and enemy faction can attack you at any time.
---
PvE you have to opt into world PvP, so you can quest without having to worry about the opposite faction.
---
You can be attacked anywhere at any time. That’s it.
---
On PvP servers when you are in contested or other factions zones you can get ganked by the opposing faction. However when you are in your factions zones you won’t get ganked. For example the barrens is a horde zone and you can’t get ganked by alliance, but you could choose to attack them. However red ridge is a contested zone where alliance can get ganked while leveling. 
---
On PvE servers you can not gank people anywhere unless you choose to flag yourself for PvP
---
Jesus you’re a toxic person. No wonder you were banned.
---
This is exactly why you have retail. Everyone demanded everything be perfectly balanced in every situation - so it all became the same. All flavor got totally destroyed.   
---
If you don't like ret, don't play it. Sure, ret and feral aren't great at raids in huge numbers (but it's a lie to say no raiding guild is going to run a feral druid to buff their rogues and hunters crit), but they're still fun classes that are great in PVP and have unique tricks.
---
hunters are literally unplayable with auto shot and pet issues
---
Stranglehorn Vale...
---
I wish I could find this map *without* the stupid text all over it.
---
These are really nice!
---
On PvP servers:
---
1. In any zone except for your capital cities the first two zones for each race on your faction (Durotar and The Barrens for example) you are automatically flagged for PvP and can be attacked by the enemy faction.
---
2. You can't create both alliance and horde characters on the same PvP server. Must choose only one faction to play on the server.
---
That's all the differences.
---
You just FD swap it.
---
It's really hard to say, because I think that there will be way more liquid gold in classic than there was in vanilla. I could easily see a reaper without mats costing several thousand gold.
---
Arcane Shot was garbage honestly. Sure it was instant cast, but it only scaled with spell damage, so you could either spend 3 sec to get weapon damage + 600 on an aimed shot or instantly deal a whopping 183 damage with arcane shot, since Aimed Shot and Arcane Shot shared cooldowns.
---
To get the  Acqual Quintessence, and yeah, I don't really get the point of EVERYONE getting it, but it's an requirement to basically become a "full raider" right away. And as I'm rolling Shadow Priest I'd really rather be in the good graces of my guild on day 1.
---
hahahahaha
---
I believe Blizz know, it's that they are in very difficult position also knowing that change would piss off a lot of people.
---
Sometimes people can be unreasonable, like those not wanting colorblind options just for the sake of no changes (there were a few posts about it some time ago).
---
would be more realms without layers is the thing
---
Testing the servers is wht the Stress Test is for. You don’t need full servers to test for bugs
---
haha, lol, watch out you might get hooked and play World of Economy Craft instead.
---
yeah, you use it at the beginning of a fight &amp; FD swap it afterward to a static trinket like Blackhand's Breadth.
---
Like a pawn shop
---
in b4 spearmint deletes
---
Bringing outdated gimmicks to PvP was one of my favourite things to do in WoW. Too bad nowadays they make basically everything obsolete. Old sets don't work, old items removed or don't work at higher level, items work only in a specific area...
---
"Fun detected" indeed.
---
There's no scarab lord in vanilla as titles didn't exist, only the mount, but that's a technicality.
---
There's no actual limit on how many can get it. You need to complete the chain and ring the gong within 10 hours of the first. The gong cannot be ring before war effort is done, and you can start the quest before hand. 
---
Any guild that can clear BWL well can get it. There's a time limit BWL clear as part of the quest chain, I think it's 4 or 6 ? hours from vael to nef, doable for any decent guild. Other than that, it's just putting in a lot of effort from primarily the guy(s) getting the mount, but also from the guild in helping with the several 20-40man quests involved in the chain.
---
"what am i supposed to do?"  
---
step 1, eat some more food joana jeez
---
So what’s your thought on que times then. If I use vacation days for launch just to sit in a que ima be furious. 
---
You have 2 options 
---
Layering
---
Or
---
Massive que times for the first couple months of classic
---
Personally I’d like to play the game.
---
It's actually pretty logical. You're never gonna win rogue v rogue if you never go into stealth.
---
It has a 1 minute cooldown and only scales (poorly) with spell damage. It's rarely a game changer to be honest, but the spell animation is cool as heck!
---
Even the mobs backpedal in classic.
---
Absolutely agreed. Blizzard certainly has the tools to run a busy server nowadays, that's no longer an issue. I still don't understand why so many people want to grind quests while avoiding people and without interruption. Maybe it's just the desire for instant gratification, I don't know. In my opinion, it's very antithetical to the philosophy of vanilla wow and as you'd mentioned, sharding or layering causes so many other issues.
---
tl;dr i don't know what layering is, or how it works.
---
It’ll be one person per server, this person will be fed mats by a guild, random people have no chance. But the whole experience is sweet. Play along and enjoy it
---
on the planet of wanting a challenge and not holding peoples hands for months until everybody is ready to take the next step together
---
Item scaling in pvp making stats pointless :(
---
Thanks for your time :)
---
Of course it isn’t. On classic, 5 mans and raiding sucks, is easy and boring. On retail the only aspect of the game that doesn’t suck is mythic raiding and mythic+ 5 mans.
---
Yeah multiple people that received without sub have said this
---
Getting Blood Craze and Enrage with a /sit macro also really changes things up.
---
Without engineering backup to fear, yeah they were pretty rough.  I also used to farm the defias trappers (?) I Westfall for nets.
---
This isn't 2004 anymore. Trust me, modern servers would have absolutely no trouble handling a crowd.
---
Duo (Warrior &amp; Mage) LF Hardcore/Semi-Hardcore Guild who plans on being one of if not the top on the server.

Oh Volley was rarely ever a great tool in and of itself, but my god was it fun to use! I miss the dang thing so much, and wish we would have gotten real Volley back in retail instead if the level 30 Marksman talent that bares it's name.
---
Archaedas proved to be an achilles heel four our four-man group (which was underleveled) as well.  His second wave of elites could be pretty brutal.
---
Honestly, I don't think they are that far off launch. There would be some bugs, but IF the stress test issues get resolved, the game would be functional and playable.
---
However, having it run for 3 months is still good.
---
They created the extra stress test for a reason. Layering didn't really get to be tested during the stress test hours.
---
Harvard business school wants to know your location.
---
more the merrier though?
---
More testers, more bugs being detected. There's no reason to not allow more players in other than blizzard wanting to keep the people trying the beta low, which doesn't make much sense considering that anyone can tune in and "experience" the beta from PoV of a stream. Adding more players at this stage won't overclock quests/zone and  won't cause server latency.
---
layering is valuing quick leveling over community. pretty much the opposite of what classic wow players want.
---
Hunters don't have volley anymore? When did that disappear?
---
and where can you be attacked if you are not flagged (on PvE servers)?
---
So killing off AQ launch event, possibly the greatest WoW event ever? If you are playing a game as easy as Classic for a challenge you are playing the wrong game. What would be challenging about it?
---
It would also improve the community to not have layering.
---
5 man and mc is easy. 
---
Many guilds will struggle with bwl and aq. And naxx is insanely hard for an average guild.
---
Oh, I don't care about PvP, to the point that I don't even consider it everything
---
I just like playing the market. I mean I would still probably gear myself out to the best of my ability but I would love to just basically collect gold and feel good about it 😅
---
Then you should have transferred lol. 10m subs and you stuck with a dead server, thats on you.
---
They took it out in either Mists or Warlords. Then they gave us back a bastardized version that really only shares the name. Their answer was "Well Multishot does the same thing lol"
---
No, that 1% Blizzard quote is not specific to Naxx. Only ~130 guild cleared Naxx before TBC dropped. That's 0.065%.
---
People remember low level content as way harder than it was, level 50+ elites were the only mobs that were somewhat challenging.
---
# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
We're looking for are mainly dedicated players. Which means, if you have the passion to keep on playing, and the willingness to show it in your commitment (i.e. show up for raids and group content, bring consumables, improve your game and so on), then you’re the kind of person we want to invite in our guild.
---
**Recruitment status:**
---
Druid - CLOSED
---
Hunter - CLOSED
---
Mage - Low
---
Rogue - Low
---
Priest - CLOSED
---
Shaman - CLOSED
---
Warlock - CLOSED
---
Warrior - Low (DPS main)
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
* A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
* Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
* English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
* Looting rules: We're planning to use a **DKP** system with **blind bidding** in order to avoid bid wars. **Loot Council** will be employed for **legendary items**. We believe this represents the fairest compromise between the needs of the guild and the needs of its members.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we're currently planning to raid from 8:30 to 11:30 CET. Earlier starting times may be considered for weekends, depending on players' turn-up.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to pop by on the discord server. When joining you’ll have a temporary rank and only see a public chat to counter any potential shenanigans.
---
Discord: discord.gg/mucN4Du
---
That kinda happened many times when people used to kite Lord Kazzak to Stormwind. He rekt everyone with shadowbolt volleys, still lots of videos on youtube.
---
No where.
---
VE is marginal. In a Lock group, it can help the healers slightly by mitigating Life Tap damage with passive healing, but if your guild is already tight on debuff slots, it's a fourth debuff that provides no damage boost. Use it if you've got the slot, but that's not why you're being brought to the raid.
---
It's really not worth it, even if you want to tank a lot of dungeons.
---
But if you insisted. What I would do is get imp. Heroic strike, tactical mastery, anger management, imp overpower, then cruelty in fury, then fill out your prot talents.
---
Early level threat is relatively high, and dual wielding vs mobs equal or 1-3 levels lower than you will result is good damage. Dual wielding will also cause enemy mobs to dodge more, resulting in more overpowers.
---
You can get some good early level 1-handers from quests (wingblade then outlaw sabre, and I believe there is one for an RFD quest) if you are horde, I never leveled alliance.
---
I can't speak for everyone, but I don't find Mythic+ rewarding at all. It's an extra layer or two of RNG on top of RNG. In Classic you have dungeons with preset drops and you either get the drop or you don't. After running the dungeon a couple times, you essentially end up getting what you need and that feels rewarding to almost everyone. There is a loot pool, you know what you can get, and it feels good to get it when you do.
---
The problem with Mythic+, imo, is that you are rorced to run the dungeons on the keys you and your friends have. Instead of that sick crit bracelet that I really need dropping from the dungeon I should be doing, I have to do the dungeon with the keys that we have and HOPE we eventually RNG into the dungeon that I actially need. So I could theoretically run it infinite times and never see the dungeon I need that week, much less the bracelet if I do, meaning I ultimately wasted my time. This is the reason I quit Legion, trying to get crit gear for my Mage was infuriating and not worth my time. If I was a healer or tank, I could pick and choose which dungeons I wanted to run from the LFG tool of people who had the dungeons I want, not a luxury DPS get. I like to grind, but when the layers of RNG are stacked in such a way where it can be impossible to get what I need, then it's not worth playing.
---
That's not to say in general and for most other classes/specs that Mythic+ doesn't work, it obviously does. Some people will absolutely even prefer Mythic+ for both gearing and gameplay purposes and that is perfectly fine. But unlike the first system that almost everyone can enjoy to SOME extent, some people can not enjoy the Mythic+ loot treadmill to ANY extent, which makes it a worse system, imo. Obviously you won't feel that way if you are one of the people who like the Mythic+ system, but that is the way it is.
---
There is also the problem of finding groups and running them efficiently. I am not talking about difficulty, but if you happen to be a DPS, you might as well not even bother making your own group since no one will join. Healers/Tanks don't have this problem and can join any group they want if they don't want to make them. That aside, this isn't something I have a problem with on my main character, but on alts, everyone is looking for people that are overgeared. If someone is advertising a +5 Mythic run, they are basically looking for people with +8 gear and so on. This isn't a problem that you see (as badly) on Classic since there is essentially just one minimum number for a dungeon because it has no levels to it.

Lastly, I don't like the timer. It's just not fun. I don't want to RP walk through a dungeon and I want to run it as fast as we can, but I also want to be able to take a break for a few seconds or swap out some gear without worrying about the timer going down and us failing to complete it in time to get a higher key. It's just not fun to me. 
---
Once again, I don't think Mythic+ is a garbage system that everyone hates. Some people definitely like it and I can absolutely see the appeal of infinite scaling, even if it's done poorly by just adding hp/damage/defense and a few weird effect modifiers. It's absolutely gross to me though, I would rather have difficulty in a more controlled environment where I feel... more in control. Not everyone wants to speed run and rely on even more RNG. It's not something that ever made WoW good from the beginning and feels like a weird direction to take for a lot of people. I'm all for cannibalizing good ideas, but if I wanted to play Diablo 3, I'd go play Diablo 3. Mythic+ should have stayed there where it belongs, imo.
---
Yeah didn't think that much money OOF! like i said i PVP ill be going with the Stormpike rep to get the unstoppable force. Assuming Phase 3 comes out somewhat fast.
---
Every time I see a no change nazi I just think to myself; they’re going to play regardless. They’re whining because they’ve been validated by their no change comrades and there is probably no changing their minds. Blizzard has certain standards they need to meet which don’t meet the expectations of parts of the community. It’s a catch 22 and I guarantee all no changers will play because they are some of the most passionate.
---
18 hours a week, on a druid went ding before Christmas lol
---
I think that's a silly conclusion
---
I'm sticking with Alliance for my main. You can always level a horde alt later and take your time with the quests.
---
I sometimes joined a pserver where some old friend was playing, but I didn't always have the time or need to start playing right away.  So I would make a lvl 1, run to the city and chat with that friend and others.  Without really playing.  But I had one game I liked:   borrow 5g and see how long it takes to turn it into 100g on the AH.  It could take weeks or months, but it would always work. (Not that I did this tons of times, I think 3 times in the past years)   The extra advantage was that any real leveling character I might play on that server later on, would have a nice financial head start.   the disadvantage is that I am totally spoiled and  when a character actually has to wear grey / white items  I feel underpowered.
---
I could be wrong, but given the gear list and knowledge now available, this seems fake. This is basically a private server pre-raid BIS list. The notepad has no signs of wearing or being damaged for "cleaning out belongings". Turban wasn't in the loot table until 1.10, so anyone who was min-maxing and making gear lists would have access to the AQ tier sets.
---
Much of the classic endgame was inspired by Everquest (Legacy of Steel members were bliz employees, and furor and tigole went to work for blizzard if I recall correctly)
---
The leveling profession is a lot easier and doesn’t require as much camp style grinding. It’s a different game I spited by the same mechanics, if that makes any sense.
---
Think Mara for hunter or lock? Brd pickpocket runs. Paladins aoe farming dungeons.
---
It is more than one.
---
Vanilla WoW is more quest oriented and you aren’t going to sit in a dungeon grinding mobs for a hours, has instanced dungeons, more green and higher gear, and more solo oriented. Vanilla WoW isn’t really as difficult as some make it sound. It’s pretty easy compared to Vanilla EQ. Harder and more time consuming compared to modern WoW though.
---
I've always been alliance and wanted to go horde and a class I've never played before for classic but I couldn't convince my friends. So I'll settle for a new class on alliance
---
On PvE servers you are automatically flagged if you enter the enemy capital city. And there are a few very small areas like the gurubashi or DM arena where it's a free for all players can be attacked by anyone, even their own faction. Also PvP flag takes 5 minutes to clear after exiting PvP, so if you leave a BG you will be PvP flagged for 5 minutes. If another player is PvP flagged and you buff or heal him then you get PvP flagged as well for 5 minutes.
---
&gt;I'm banned from the classic wow forums for voicing my concerns on layering/sharding
---
You realize there won’t be “any patience to play with others” because no one would be able to log on. Also layering will be removed by phase 2 longer before most of the player base is 60. 
---
Seriously, you’d rather have que times for MONTHs rather than layering for phase 1? 
---
Some of us have jobs and can only play a couple hours a night. If I have to spend an hour+ in que to log in I just won’t be able to play at all. 
---
Layering is valuing people’s ability to play during phase 1 over everything. Idk why that’s such a bad thing. You guys just want to complain
---
AQ launch event should be in from the start since we're doing 1.12.1 servers, just like it was on new servers that opened up after AQ
---
Getting rid of it equals turning it off.
---
Why is your resolution stretched?  Clearly don’t have the right one selected for widescreen
---
Miss miss parry parry dodge miss dead.   
---
   
---
That fucking mob was one lvl bellow me.
---
Shadow meld is super fun.  Especially since BGs wont be out until phase 3.  Also starting in the night elf starting zone is way better for launch, dwarf/gnome place will be packed.  Also in the night elf starting area you get access to owls which are in my opinion the best leveling pet(just make sure to tame a vulture in west fall for screech and your owl can hold aggro on multiple targets.
---
get dunked on my son
---
Anyone found one with no spelling errors? I’d be interested. I couldn’t buy one with the errors though it would annoy me too much.
---
Ohh ok thank you the way people talk about it I immediately  think of vanilla eq the way I felt there.  But I probably wouldn't have nearly enough  time for  vanilla eq nowadays so classic wow seems like a good game!
---
Layering/sharding is supposed to only be in the early zones, where all the backups with leveling will be.
---
Can there be some exploiting? Yes in any situation. Humans are built to learn the rules so they can exploit them. Happens everywhere every time.
---
Your point of the black lotus farming is moot. The only feasible way to get shards or layers is to have a massive population in that area, so competition would be fierce anyway, and besides they originally said they probably won't a hard anything past like level 20, and I see that as a reasonable estimate.
---
The amount of time required to level to 20 will be enough that the tourists will be done by then, as well as the casual/altoholic group separated from the semi hard and hard core players.
---
Not possible :) WoW Classic 76.
---
There's lots of things to do in the game. What do you mean by "not play the game at all"? You don't have to solo quests all day and night racing to 60. There's other, more enjoyable, stuff to do.
---
Also torn, will be following comments.
---
It does make sense thank you! It seems like I'll enjoy it either way as I've always liked slow progression
---
Do you basically want Classic to be done in 6 months? Guess I just can’t really comprehend that, as it will still be trivial raid content just lose out on the community building and rivalries.
---
Me too,  nothing wrong with taking it at your own pace.
---
As a reminder, there is no race. Sure you can get to raiding sooner by getting to 60, but the journey is the best part. Another note, I played pservers and was able to get into fun, good guilds and was months late in terms of when the server actually opened up.
---
I hope not. It sucks, but it definitely builds that faction resentment and could potentially lead to organized PvP.
---
But at the same time, imagine being so bored that you allotted time in a 24+hr period to stand around and kill a low level quest NPC in an uncontested zone  If people had just moved on and skipped the quest, they would have gotten bored and left.
---
queue time for months? you're losing it man. sky isn't falling without or without layers. I can sit through a 5 min server queue without raging, I'm not 12
---
Valuing people's abilities to play during phase 1 &gt; late game community is the wrong call. It's more throwing shiny things to the whiny babies that will go back to the loot machine on live anyways. Let them hit the vanilla wall hard so they don't poison the community with their instant gratification playstyle.
---
Raiding makes me want to die, I just want to PvP :)
---
You weren’t in the stress test, were you?
---
Not all hardcore minmaxers are douchebags... why do people think this?
---
You're thinking from the perspective of raiding, and I think that's part of the problem. If you balance everything around raids, suddenly it becomes unbalanced elsewhere. Modern wow is a lot more raid-focused than vanilla ever was.
---
Grow up lol
---
This is all you need to know https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjHclWPVij0
---
Yeah lol.
---
I mean without layering you’ll be sitting in a que of thousands of people just to log in. Did you not read my post?
---
Not anywhere, just contested zones and hostile zones. Friendly zones are safe zones for the friendly faction.
---
Yeah, I'm not going to click on any of that. wtf, reddit
---
Let me just conjure up some mail for every slot and a green shield by the time i hit level 17 then.
---
I'm hoping the Oceanic server will be less packed on a Tuesday at 10am!
---
6/10 not enough buttons for macro key binds.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
More dynamic combat, less time consuming leveling, and corpse runs are a joke in comparison. Hell levels don’t exist, the item market isn’t as fun, and the zone’s mobs are generally all around the same level. Random gryphon or brownie will not be ruining your day, and if you do get attacked, you can outrun. No more booking it across Karana to find a zone line.
---
Same - never done alliance before.
---
Haha I didn’t mean to do it like that but you have a point.
---
WoW PvP revolves around being 'flagged' for PvP, which is the little Alliance/Horde icon beside your portrait. When you are flagged for PvP, enemy players can attack you at will.
---
In a PvP server, you are automatically flagged PvP as soon as you enter a contested or hostile zone. You are not flagged for PvP in a friendly zone unless you manually flag, assist a player who is flagged, or attack an enemy player who is flagged. When you leave a hostile or contested zone and return to a friendly zone, you still have the 5 minute cool down before the flag is removed. You cannot do anything that would otherwise flag you for PvP, otherwise the 5 minute cool down stops and resets.
---
On a PvE server, you are only automatically flagged for PvP in a hostile zone. In contested and friendly zones, you are only flagged for the same reasons above in a friendly zone.
---
So the main difference between the two is simply whether contested zones automatically flag you for PvP or not. Contested zones make up the majority of the zones from level 20+, so almost everywhere you go you cannot opt of for PvP.
---
PvE servers you can opt out, but you can't just flag in and out at will. The 5 minute cool down stops this abuse so that if you attack another player and kill them, you can't immediately deflag.
---
Which you want to play on is up to you. Personally I will be rolling on a PvE because PvP ruleset is largely abused by higher levels to gank lower players in 1 shot who are defenseless.
---
What word is that?
---
*RESIST* *MAGIC JUICE*
---
yeah he does, one for each rank heal. ;)
---
You're welcome :)
---
I liked leveling in Vanilla. I made a paladin, warrior, priest and mage to 52 (began around Naxx, finished after we cleared t5, so finished before the leveling nerf). 
---
Classic feels exactly like leveling that mage. And it should. 
---
I remember needing to grind mobs on my Paladin and warrior. I started the Paladin on day 1 and the warrior on the same day bwl was released. That was never an issue for my priest or mage. Waiting for objects in the world to respawn wasn’t a thing on my clothes. 
---
I dunno, the game is quite different in 1.12 to what it was in 1.1. 
---
I’m happy its so much more time and attention intensive than live leveling (which shockingly is an improvement over where it was from mop-legion, I used to be able to run from north shire to deadmines, not doing any quests, killing mobs and exploring, walk right into deadmines then proceed to solo it). But I’m pretty much always down for making things harder.
---
$80 at officemax?
---
Depends on what "best" means.
---
Dwarf has amazing racials when things go south. Clearing bleeds and diseases is awesome. 
---
Nelf has the Shadowmeld ability. Rogues are good because they have the jump on other players. Being a Nelf gives multiple classes that advantage. 
---
Human can theoretically qualify for pvp vendor gear quicker with improved reputation gains. They can also potentially nullify a stealthed enemies advantage by ruining their opening. 
---
Gnomes can escape roots and frost novas for more mobility. Super useful. And hard to target for clickers. 
---
So it depends on what you value and what feels more important. Want an edge when fighting rogues? Go human or dwarf. Want an edge when fighting druids and mages? Go gnome. Like catching people with their pants down? Go Nelf.
---
I have seen the rogue one before I think, the hunter one sounds fun though
---
Play the one you find most aesthetically pleasing because you're going to be spending a lot of time with the toon.
---
Oh yea! Stance dance macro's the key for success
---
More bug reports are not necessarily a good idea. The Classic team is small and I bet they are already drowning in reports. ;) More *good* testers wouldn't hurt but just letting in more people might be counterproductive.
---
You can create animated wallpapers with video files using the Wallpaper Engine software. It's as simple as opening Wallpaper Engine, clicking "Create Wallpaper", and selecting the video file. There's extra steps involved if you want to get fancy, but that's the gist of it.
---
That’s just not true or I’m an amazing PvP player (hint: I’m not)
---
I leveled my warrior in Vanilla while playing a lot of BG (it was a reroll) and I smashed face as did many other warrior that I faced or played with.
---
Now ok when you hit lvl60 and you face people already decked out and you have only you’re poor Ice barbed spear and green helm of the bear and you must charge Paladin in T2 you feel completely helpless but the 49 warrior jumping on a 49 player never felt hopeless to me.
---
Seriously considering telling my fam I'm leaving my job and going on welfare to play with them more
---
That was what I just said.  The douchebag flag is the application process which usually turns out to be true.
---
What do you mean, hamstring kite doesn't work?
---
Priest is better
---
No i meant what class is best in pvp that is available to human, dwarf or nelf?  I cant seem to choose.
---
classic is more likely to be done in 6 months when everybody is decked from MC and BWL twiddling their thumbs waiting for something that isn't faceroll just like they do on retail
---
They stressed the shit out of that, firstly. But more importantly, they can absolutely ramp it up. They are just trying to find the most cost-effective way of running the servers, and layering is a way to keep their costs low.
---
BubbleHearth still works.
---
The Paladin gets to say he survived. The Warlock gets to say he won.
---
Source: Won’t play them all for a while, but my 3 precreated characters will be Warlock, Pally, Druid
---
Can’t save if you don’t have income rolling in. And since you don’t have a job, you must be supported by someone else, not everyone is that lucky.
---
I believe they said sharding will only be there for the first phase, so yeah my guess is that will drastically help leveling in the very low levels.
---
He said fast leveling speed is around 8 days. 8 days divided by 28 hours a week is 6.85 weeks which is slightly less than 2 months.
---
Warrior priest , nonstop pulling and dungeon grouping
---
You appear to want an endgame raiding game, that isn’t Classic WoW. I’d advise you play retail if you want hard raids.
---
Sharding is needed, period.
---
You people can complain all you want, it's gonna happen.
---
Ya I played alliance but will be rolling horde
---
 this time.
---
Email was on the 21st, day before the beta.
---
Why? This isn't 2004 anymore, servers can handle more than 2500 players.
---
Warlock or Druid (Alliance PvP Server) - looking for hardcore PvE guild to progress content. PvP will be in my off time. Looking to raid Friday, Saturday, or Sundays. I raided hardcore Vanilla thru TBC as a warlock and know all the fights. Looking for mature players that know the raids, come prepared to raids, and help each other progress. Prefer loot council. 
---
PM me if I fit your guild.
---
Can't wait to get ZHC from ZG when it is released.
---
Looks like an uncomfortable leg situation.
---
Vanilla had 7 to 8 million subs at its peak, not 10.
---
And Mannoroth was never dead, I wasn't speaking to just my experience.
---
OP says no XRBG's because it will ruin the realm's community and your argument is "pay money to leave the community for a better one!" Okay.
---
I played Vanilla WoW from about 6 months after launch and played religiously until TBC came out.
---
I was level 50 when TBC came out, with about 1800 hours played.  I dicked around a good bit, but I seriously played and still couldn't hit max by then.  It was insane!
---
So, let me get this right. Your saying a que time would be good to “teach retail players real vanilla by having massive que times so they’ll go back to live”
---
Wow dude. Your kinda a prick.
---
I’m thinking of trying Voice Attack.
---
I want layering, and I'm happy about it.
---
I made sure to voice it, so blizz knows we're happy they're making the game playable.
---
You hate it ? too bad.
---
You have several zones:  
---
Friendly: These zones are friendly towards your faction. (Green Text)
---
Contested: These zones are zones where both factions can attack one another (Orange text)
---
Hostile: These zones are zones where the enemy faction is safe, but your faction is not (Red Text) \[the direct reverse of friendly zones\]
---
You have a choice in PvE servers to flag yourself (type /pvp or toggle it in a menu) inside friendly zones or contested zones. In hostile zones, you auto flag regardless.
---
If you attack a player who is flagged, you automatically flag yourself. And have 10(?) minutes before your flag releases outside of combat (if you attack an enemy player, it resets the timer).
---
In PvP servers, you are automatically flagged inside Contested Zones, and Hostile zones. However, you can toggle your PvP status in friendly zones (same attacking rules apply if you engage a flagged player)
---
The only exception is the gurubashi arena. Inside the arena pit (the inner circle, stands don't count) its a free-for-all, where everyone can attack everyone (Except your group, obviously)
---
I don't understand this.
---
Warriors, for the most part, do not level as tanks. He at least had a Shield even if it wasn't good.
---
And it's not like you have a lot of gear choice at that level.
---
NANI?!
---
U can do mara on private servers at like lv 54 as a rogue. Not sure if it will be possible on retail though.
---
im with you on that, most streamers behave like beggars and god that shit is annoying
---
shh don't tell em'
---
Questie is straight up gonna power grouped leveling been using it on my paladin and it's like looking at retail map for objectives
---
Well when I was lvl 18 back then there was a group looking for a warrior for DM. 
---
I joined and went in with my 2h... 
---
I had no idea what a tank was and no idea what aggro was. Yep that my first mmo rpg back then :D
---
I also have this exact question. I read something about duo stealth runs with a druid but that may refer to dire maul farming in phase two. Hopefully pickpocket runs still net a decent amount
---
A mage with raiding gear and buffs will have about ~200 spirit, the human racial adds 5% so you gain ~10 spirit.  10 spirit is ~2.5 mana per tick.  You regen mana every 5 seconds while casting from the "Five Second Rule", with mage armor you can regen 30% of your mana and with 3/3 Arcane Meditation you get an additional 15% mana regen while casting, so this 2.5 mana per tick goes down to 1.125 mana per tick.  During an 8 min fight you will gain an extra 108 mana over a non-human mage.  This isn't enough to cast any useful spells in raid.  For evocation you'd get like an extra 200 mana from 10 spirit, which is nice but not really that noticeable.  The total mana you save if you had to full evo and then still ran out of mana would be like 1 frostbolts worth of mana.
---
In the end the human racial is pretty negligible, although you could also make the argument that the gnome racial is also pretty negligible but objectively speaking the gnome racial at least will grant you an extra crits over the duration of a raid, the human racial doesn't really give you anything.
---
You too! :)
---
Yea, and this sub alone has over 100k subs, assuming 50% of the people are on reddit ( which is really high) you’ll have 200k+ people playing. 
---
You really think they’re planning on rolling out 50+ servers? I was under the impression there was going to be like 8
---
Appreciate the input! Sad to hear this.
---
if i were to take a guess probably like 300 people per layer. which is really low
---
Looking for a friend or two to adventure with once classic is out! I’ve played on and off since vanilla. West coast evenings ~7pm-10pm+. I’m going to play human warrior or dwarf priest for easy dungeon groups (leaning warrior, so I prefer a class w/ heals). Prefer Alliance, but whatever. PvE or PvP OK (not a big PvPer though). I’m 34 w/ wife and kid so can’t nolife it, but will play as serious as I can. Guild invites also okay.
---
I also speak Mandarin and Japanese, so if you are Chinese or Japanese and want a an American WoW friend, don’t be shy!
---
Yes they did.
---
They made it so that for every level you gained you lost 2 energy restored.
---
Eventually rogues were still using it in BC Arena even though it was not OP it was pretty clear Blizzard didn't enjoy balancing for it so I think they changed it to removing 4 energy per level effectively making it useless.
---
Cool, I guess ?
---
Oh ok well I definitely  didn't enjoy the corpse runs in eq1.. but it was fun in a way to have to avoid sand giants and spectres and other big baddies!  Thanks for the info :)
---
Tank/healer is always a winning combination.
---
I love leveling with a mage though, especially if you're doing a lot of dungeons. It's generally pretty easy to find a pug healer, but having a mage for sheep/counterspell/dungeon control is really nice.
---
They are both really good duos, I would just choose which class you like better.
---
**&lt;Frozen Dawn&gt; [A] EU PvP Server | Suomi PvE/PvP**
---
**Intro**
---
Frozen Dawn is a Finnish speaking guild recruiting for Classic WoW. As we are targeting people speaking finnish, the following recruitment post is completely in Finnish. Do trust that it does not include anything that is against the rules or norms of these forums.
---
**Meistä**
---
Frozen Dawn on vuoden 2006 alussa perustettu aikuisille suunnattu lähinnä MMO-pelejä pelaava suomikilta, joka sen jälkeen on muodostunut massiiviseksi pelaajayhteisöksi ja suomiportaaliksi, jonka meriitit ovat erittäin vakuuttavia ja peliskaala hyvin laaja. Killan toiminta alkoi pienestä Dungeons&amp;Dragons Online -porukasta ja on ajan mittaan kasvanut ja levinnyt mm. World of Warcraftin, Warhammerin, AION:in, Lotron, EVE Onlinen sekä monien muiden pelien maailmoihin. Jokaista näistä peleistä pelataan vielä, toisia enemmän ja toisia vähemmän, ja tarkoituksenamme on myös jatkossakin laajentaa peliskaalaa tulevien pelien pariin. Tällä hetkellä killan toiminta on aktiivisinta Final Fantasy XIV:ssä, Guild Wars 2:ssa ja kestosuosikki Dungeon&amp;Dragons Online:ssa.
---
Frozen Dawn saapuu Azerothiin ISOSTI, sillä WoW Classic tulee olemaan yksi yhteisömme isoista peleistä, jossa pyritään saavuttamaan merkittävä status tulevan Classic WoWin maailmassa. Tavoitteenamme on rakentaa suurin ja menestyvin Suomikilta alkuperäiseen Azerothiin ja nauttia oikean MMORPG:n yhteisöllisyydestä ja haasteesta. Me olemme jo aikuisia ja moni myös perheellisiä, eikä meillä ole välttämättä aikaa enää raidata viittä päivää viikossa, mutta me teemme kaikkea contenttia aina raideista PvP:hen sillä ajalla, joka meillä on käytettävissä.
---
**Mitä tarjoamme?**
---
Pitkäikäisen ja menestyneen pelaajayhteisön, jonka riveissä SINULLA on mahdollisuus pelata juuri niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat, mutta silti saavuttaa myös menestystä pelissä hyvällä porukalla. Me emme halua pakottaa sinua mihinkään - saat pelata täsmälleen sitä hahmoa jota haluat, täsmälleen niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat. Toivomme ensisijaisesti uusiksi Frozenilaisiksi sosiaalisia, hurttia huumoria omaavia ihmisiä. Se, oletko nopea tai hidas levuttamaan, ei ole tärkeää. Tärkeää on se, että sinulla on järki päässä ja sydän paikallaan. Meillä ei ole osallistumispakkoja, vaan osallistumismahdollisuuksia. Meillä on kuitenkin yleisen vapaan ja rennon toimintatavan ohella myös mahdollisuus pelata ryhmissä, joissa on korkeat tavoitteet, ja näihin toivommekin ensisijaisesti aktiivisia ja pitkäpinnaisia pelaajia, joilta löytyy tahtoa toteuttaa asioita.
---
**Raidaus**
---
Tällä hetkellä suunnittelemme, että Classic WoW:ssa tullaan raidaamaan 2-3 kertaa viikossa inhimillisellä aikataululla. Alustavana tavoitteenamme on kuitenkin clearata kaikki PvE content pelissä, mutta maaliin ei ole kiire. Tarkempi raidausaikataulu toteutetaan yhteistyössä koko killan jäsenistön kesken lähempänä julkaisuaikataulua.
---
**PvP**
---
Killassa tullaan myös järjestämään organisoitua PvP:tä. Myös korkeampaa PvP rankkia metsästäviä killasta löytyy ja tahtoa saavuttaa suuria asioita myös Horden nirhaushommissa.
---
**Hakeminen**
---
Meille voi hakea yhteisömme web-sivuilla: https://www.frozendawn.fi/ Selaa foorumeille ja sieltä löytyvälle alafoorumille ”WoW Classic hakemukset”. Hakemusohje löytyy foorumin kiinteänä viestinä.

Honestly, done it many times. Don't spend gold on spells you won't use while leveling. That far sight? That eyes of the beast? Ranks of rupture or backstab? Skip them.
---
Don't buy gear very often. If you're a warrior or rogue this is hard, but try to only buy a weapon if you're 10+ levels past what you already have and only if it's cheap. 
---
Loot everything. Vendor everything that you won't 100% need.
---
Don't level crafting professions till you are 40+ with a mount.
---
You will have at least 80/100 gold when you reach 40 even if you don't trade a single thing to another person. Vendor only.
---
“Frenetic combat”
---
Lo, how things have changed.
---
It keeps my hype on a high though.
---
I've been told via my sources that they actually have 2 dart boards in the office (1 Horde, 1 Alliance) - Everyday 2 staff members are blindfolded and span around like pin the tail on the donkey. They then throw the dart and it has a variety of options which will automatically occur once landing has commenced.
---
Unfortunatley for the past few days the dart has not been landing anywhere of use for us not in the beta (Usually in silly places like "Create new bug: Gun no work").
---
So I think it is just down to getting an agile employee to throw the dart.
---
Nelf!!
---
So autists can't be druids?
---
I leveled my warrior to 70 a couple months after TBC was released and it was my third 70 at the time.  It was brutally painful to level him as every pull was razor thin in living or dying.  Every consumable was fed from my other toons to keep his progress up and to make steady gains.  I was lucky I leveled undead for cannibalize or it would have taken even longer.  Getting a new weapon greatly increased your ability to kill things quickly and getting to TBC with him made it even better since the loot from quests was so good and I could really see his power climb from that point.  No regrets, but damn was it a slog compared to every other class I have played.
---
Yeah, sortof this, and there are a lot of "collect x" quests in the game (or that are part of a chain). The upside is that you never get held back doing quests, you can just brute your way through any cave/camp/elite quest without having to group up. If you plan to level on a PvP server you'll also be a lot safer: Even fighting higher level opponents you can still pack a punch.
---
And of course you'll have a lot of fun!
---
[Who Cares](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fb/8a/dd/fb8add2877b48f6158397a3112806ba7.jpg)
---
Exactly!
---
If you are going to PvP Horde has better armor.
---
If you are going to PvE Humans look better in raid armor.

I leveled alliance since the end of BC. So I’m going to start something new
---
Only Hunters and Rogues unfortunately (I am sorry)
---
It took like 3-4 weeks for the fastest servers, iirc.
---
Most others took 2-3 months
---
I remember the high end pve guilds offered sale runs in bwl. But during this time period, they changed to offering “gear tokens” which were earned by farming war effort materials then mailing them to the guild for them to turn in. Said tokens could be used in sale runs to purchase gear instead of loot.
---
Pretty interesting things people came up with to incentivize the war effort. 
---
Cause as random non hardcore raider, after you turned in enough to get exalted with the cities (I think they gave rep, or was it only the cloth turn ins?) why keep doing it? So servers with 1 serious raiding guild per side had to find ways to get people to help.
---
They replaced sharding with something called Layering, which is basically mini servers on the original. So its kind of like mega sharding - 1500 people per shard.
---
Rogues as they have a mechanism to drop threat. A fury warrior with TF has no way of lowering their threat and would pose a danger to the raid of getting aggro.
---
you asked me why timegating raids is bad, I told you why.  that doesn't mean I'm only playing wow to raid.
---
raiding isn't the only part of the game, but it's still a part of the game.
---
I also mentioned Layering as the first thing on my list of things I'd wish they'd change their mind.  does layering have to do with raids?  no, layering ruins the 
---
&gt; community building and rivalries.
---
Warrior are like the ultimate bully class while levelling. As long as you outlevel and outgear your enemy, you feel overpowered. You do a dumb amount of damage, take almost no damage in return, and you're a mana-less class, so you never have to sit down to drink.
---
They on record said it's 3000 per layer my guy
---
"Friends" don't let friends play alliance
---
Paladins are already likeable though this poll shows paladins and shamans separate they are faction based classes while if you vote for warrior for example it could be both horde or alliance.

Haha yes let's have some QoL changes mate, how about LFR whilst we're at it? Lmao.
---
I don’t think people realize how much was needed to complete those quests.
---
the actual corpse runs were never fun, but taking them out of the game removed an element that made EQ so exciting at times. It's almost like enjoying the good days because you've experienced the bad. You can remove all the bad days but then there might be something lost from the good.
---
Paladins are one of the easiest classes to level, but overall still quite slow.
---
You can tank DM with a 2H just fine
---
The polearm off of Rend in UBRS.

Can i pretend to be a rogue in cat form + stealth?

**&lt;Quidi Vidi Society&gt;**
---
\[US - Horde\]  
---
\[PVP\]  
---
\[Classic Faction TBD\] (based on guild vote)
---
\[Raid Times TBD pending gathering a suitable group\] (current members all across canada)  
---
\[Raiding, PVP, Social\]
---
&lt;Quidi  Vidi Society&gt; is a group of vanilla players returning to the game in  anticipation for WoW: Classic. We are looking for like-minded people to  level and enjoy the game with. Our goal is to complete some raid  content in retail before moving on to WoW: Classic leveling and raiding  upon release. Our core player base is spread across Canada.
---
**Guild Goals:**
---
* Develop a core team to enjoy classic leveling / raiding with. Our primary goal is having fun with the game.
---
* Complete  some raid content! We are hoping we can complete some retail content  before moving on to leveling together and ultimately raiding in Classic.
---
* Most  people would like to maintain their social lives if they choose to be a  part of this guild. I expect most players will be somewhat casual at  least. A core group of us would like to push ourselves a little further.
---
Our  group is composed of previous players with mixed experience levels in  raiding and content. Some of the players will not be joining us until  the guild moves into classic.
---
**We expect members who want to be a part of our group to:**
---
* **(MOST IMPORTANTLY)** Be relaxed about crude humor - we love to joke around in discord and some may consider us insensitive at times.
---
* Show up to Guild activities that they have previously agreed to.
---
* Be  able to use discord &amp; microphones for guild activities. We want to  get to know you and have fun joking around in discord :)
---
* Be  understanding that a lot of our members have jobs and social lives. We  choose to have some players around who are more casual than we are  because we enjoy their company.
---
* Be 19+ please. We are all 27 - 30.
---
* Be  willing to play on a schedule that falls between NDT (Newfoundland Time  / UTC -2:30) and MST (Mountain Standard Time /  UTC-07)
---
* Must be willing to bring flasks / food items to raids where progression is important.
---
* Must be 420 / Alcohol friendly - Although the guild is not themed around either, some guild members choose to **legally** partake in cannabis / alcohol in their relaxation time.
---
**Bonus points if people have experience in Retail or Classic raiding. Our core group will certainly need a hand getting started!**

So I didn't pay everquest, but when WoW released it was specifically tailored to be markedly more casual and accessible. Quick google search tells me some broad strokes are more forgiving penalties for dying, more quests, content might be a little easier in general, more solo-friendly leveling experience. I mean somebody will probably chime in with a more thorough list.
---
Some of the original WoW devs were EQ players, and some of the things they didn't like were changed for WoW. Tigole supposedly didn't like Paladins and so the class was significantly nerfed during the beta, and this all supposedly revolved around a quibble he had from another game (EQ).
---
The long and the short is WoW was the casual man's MMO. It was not and never has been "hardcore".

Layering as it is on the beta will be annoying but manageable for 2 weeks, any more and it is a big issue I agree. Not time gating raids would remove a ton of content as the best gear would make raiding MC for e.g pointless for a lot of classes.
---
Are there any UI addons out there that improve the customization options if the base UI without altering the aesthetic at all? Been using ElvUi for years, but want to have more vanilla looking action bars and unit frames.
---
Just because they’re orc is a BS reason to get an axe over another race
---
I'm picturing a warrior but his upper half is more like a lawnmower because he has to swing so many times when all three of these plus windfury, warrior talent, and the actually first attack. A small chance for 7 attacks in 1 lmao.
---
It’s still fun even if it is simpler. I didn’t play EQ, but I did play Anarchy Online which was from that time of everything taking forever and being inconvenient before WoW released. Love both styles and Vanilla WoW felt just time consuming enough and hard enough to just not be an absolute chore for every little thing. So better for the older person that just doesn’t have time to grind mobs in a dungeon spot for 4 hours. 😄
---
Troll for Hex of Weakness and Shadowguard or UD for WotF.
---
I honestly thought my mage was second worst to level out of them all.  OOM was a constant struggle and the water/food you can summon is usually quite slow to regen your mana pool.  Getting a new rank of conjure water is like a warrior getting an upgraded weapon, the time it takes to quest and grind goes way down just because it doesn't actually take 30 seconds to fill your mana bar.
---
Not if they're a friend and I want them to be doing some heavy hitting with me. I'm not saying I'll never rock an axe

Why do you think there will be more gold in the economy?
---
Thank you for this.
---
Well that seems crazy...
---
It'll be interesting to see whether classic destroys the youth of another generation. Thanks for sharing!
---
you expect millions of players to love classic ? lol
---
Orc Warlock, Undead Warrior, Tauren Druid, Dwarf Hunter, Troll Mage, Human Paladin, Night Elf Priest
---
This clip is gold
---
Although not exactly the same, I did similar things to goldfarmers/bots while waiting for the battlegrounds (and boy the waiting took some time, since my server, Silvermoon EU had hardly any Horde). I used to taunt the mob they attacked (which was usually engaged by a hunter pet) and lured it into other mobs.
---
Good times
---
A tank is always needed.
---
Druid can bear tank and heal at 60 for 5 man's..  I much prefer a druid tank over war in 5 man dungeons.
---
Tigole, AKA Jeff Kaplan worked on WoW for years yeah.  Now he’s the lead of the Overwatch team.
---
Old AV and the old unarmoured epic mounts. Both belong in the museum.
---
Druids with gear and a good player behind the keyboard are able to tank most of vanilla wow raids and dungeons
---
When they disabled decursive at the end of classic right before the BC patch, several fights in Naxx 40 became pants-on-head retarded, so where they actually needed to be retuned (iirc.)
---
Druid leveling will be easier, they are one of the best levelers. Druids are good dungeon tanks as well as good off tanks for raids. However, if you really hate healing you are much better off going as warrior. Having a heal button means people will expect you to heal at times.
---
If a comment like that is perceived as snarky then I fear for anyone who finds themselves in conversation with you.
---
Where's the challenge in classic ? It's all mindless grind. The only thing that is challenging is trying to find the will to keep playing :D
---
DD &lt; DPS
---
Sm gy boss is easy to get to but unsure if a rogue can solo the boss.
---
No I won't lol
---
It's very strong in pvp. Tauren warriors can land auto attacks outside of a mages frost nova range for example.
---
I think this is actually pretty accurate. I know a lot of people will disagree, but if they do, they should post screenshots with their time played when they ding 60 and compare it to what the chart said. 
---
There are a lot of variables, such as grouping, continuity of play(there's a big difference from playing 1 hour ten times and 10 hours at once), rested status, whether you could afford your mount, and so on.
---
It's probably more work for them which us why they're not bothering, but they absolutely *can* do it since private servers managed.
---
We had that emperor run down to a science by the time I got one on my rogue.
---
Except it has petals, 2!
---
Sidestick homie. Get it together!
---
should we timegate levels so people don't skip dungeons?  if we do that we can extend the life of classic for years and years as you collect BIS for the lvl 10 meta, the lvl 20 meta, the lvl 30 meta
---
MC isn't pointless just because Naxx exists. raids only drop so much gear, you'll be running Naxx for weeks and can still get upgrades from MC.
---
&gt; I was under the impression there was going to be like 8
---
Where did you get that from? 8 is FAR too few, even after the initial hype wears off.
---
He’s annoying
---
private server pop wasn't even 100k, there are like 2 big servers with barely 10k, everything else is like 100 players here and there.
---
rogue because they can use it for pvp aswell
---
I'd be more on the side of druid as a casual. If raiding isn't your top goal you have more flexibility with a druid.  You're good in PvP.  You can swap gear to perform all three roles. You'll be able to complete quests that others will need groups or have to spend more time clearing mobs out to complete.  You level faster due to less downtime post-20 with cat form and the ability to heal yourself.  
---
I'm a druid. I have more hardcore goals, but understand the desire for casual gameplay as I was a casual player in Vanilla. 
---
Don't get me wrong.  Warrior is great.  However, once 60 you'll be a bit more boxed in by spec and gear.  Plus you'll be competing with many warriors for a tanking or dps spot. Sure, druids fight rogues for gear, but there's also gear that only a druid sees as good.  So I say druid! 😁
---
So disappointing :D
---
It's guns in dun morough.  Nelfs can train to use them.
---
MC is invalidated by a lot of dungeon gear by the time 1.12 comes out. Have you played vanilla before?
---
Now that's a meme: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/o-rly
---
Check out Skarm on YT (even tho it is pserver)
---
Balance Druid is also shit at PvP. Disc is shit at both. Many specs are shit at both PvE and PvP.
---
Cath is easier than armory IMO, the pulls are much easier.
---
The wizard pull a few halls before herod is nasty if you get it wrong
---
Part of the reason I think they might change thier minds is because that excuse is so silly. People will rush through leveling regardless.
---
If you reserve an item you use ML for that boss.....
---
This isn't accurate at all.
---
I leveled a rogue to 60 in Vanilla in ~9d12h /played, it was my first ever 60.
---
I leveled a rogue to 60 on a "blizz-like" Pserver in ~5d20h using an addon without any real min/maxing.
---
I'm certainly not Joana with all that death warping, so I put "Fast".
---
Your app claims it'll take me ~230 hours /played to ding 60 (which is 9.5 days).
---
If I can do that without any guides or experience, it's certainly not going to be the same.
---
That’s probably true. My first go at warrior (retail launch time) was a lot tougher than any warrior I do now.
---
You play a class, not a spec. That's especially true for pvp.
---
As a drummer id love to have this lmao. Maybe add execute to the snare and i can play the game while drumming
---
Ahhhhhh okay. Makes sense.
---
Should the naxx event be going on at the same time?
---
You can't finish dungeons at-level without a group. A lot of them you can come back and solo after you significantly outlevel them, but this doesn't solve the problem later in the game when you can't outlevel the later dungeons enough, let alone raids.
---
Making friends is easy. People will spam in a chat channel that they need people to run WC. You can join them that way, and you can also decide "I want to run WC and get these quests I just got done" and just open up trade, lfg, or whatever global channel Blizz implements (assuming they will) and say as much. Sometimes it takes a while to get a group going, but around launch this probably won't be an issue.
---
Were there anybody in the group you'd like to run with again in the future? Add them to your friends list. Tell them, and they'll probably add you, too. This is how you make friends. It's super easy. This also works in the modern game, by the way, people just rely so much on the UI elements (LFD, LFR, LFG) that they don't do it much anymore.
---
You don't need real life friends to make friends in WoW. People will happily add you to their friends lists and do groups with you as long as you are a team player and willing to learn.
---
Yeah holy fuck imagine blasting someone with Aimed+double Multi+aa if anything crits. Can't wait to play vanilla hunter again.
---
Disc priest isn't good at PvP or PvE. Neither is balance. And many other specs.
---
I don't see why "Go play retail" applies to me for wanting better class balance. I even mentioned that it doesnt have to be consistent balance patches throughout the game, just minor buffs that get tested in PvP and PvE in Beta. I don't agree that balance means there are useless specs.
---
I played and loved Vanilla just like most others here. And I'll be playing Classic. And this wont impact me because conveniently, the 3 classes I'm playing are all top tier. But it sucks for people that want to play Druid in a hardcore guild but don't want to heal, or want to play Shadow Priest but will only be 1 spot per guild, and so on.
---
naw Im saying that trying to satisfy people who want instant gratification is what killed this game
---
some people really think that classic will kill BFA ? lol
---
Wrong you are, Ken.
---
DD actually makes more sense when referring to the role.
---
Damage dealer makes a ton more sense than damage per second. Damage per second is what you do not what role you have.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
Pretty apt, everyone wants vanilla, but also the QOL of Retail addons.
---
Ive always just used CapsLock as ptt.
---
Why would you troll like this
---
*easier, not better.
---
DPS is what it’s been for 14 years. Doesn’t have to make sense.
---
But that's 0.0002% of your Epic Mount!
---
You act like you can have perfect balance between things and still have a huge diversity of abilities. Blizz has proven they can't deliver that. 'Go play retail' applies because that's where this path leads
---
&gt; It’ll be one person per server
---
The alternative is people just “beating” the game in terms of their goals and leaving.  Far better to have TBC and eventually Wrath (beyond that is the “current” game) servers added.
---
Oh you’re right. I guess no cap increase this week
---
- Dot-shield-wand till 40, do the same in Shadowform until 60, respec 31/20/0 or 21/30/0 at 60 and never look back.
---
- Horde, because I can’t stand Alliance except Dwarves. Undead because torn shoes are still better than no shoes.
---
- Questing + Dungeons, maybe grinding for mats between objectives.
---
- Most likely I will as I won’t be rushing too hard.
---
- Mining + Skinning. Might drop Skinning for Tailoring at 60 to get the robes, or go straight for Engineering once I got my 100% mount.
---
- No, because I’m going to be a healer which is more rewarding than trying to push mediocre DPS out of a subpar spec and sinking tons of gold in the process while Mages and Locks have a priority on gear over me.
---
- Most of you Spriest wannabes are going to end up as healers. :^)
---
- No, but I might roll a Warlock alt for a more rewarding “edgelord” experience with a similarly boring PvE rotation.
---
Pickpocket runs or chest runs in lower level (compared to BRD) dungeons.
---
"Now touch me... with his gloves"
---
&gt;not sure if any of them reported it.
---
he actually told his stream and his party to not report it until after they were done. They never reported it.
---
Stfu
---
You're so obsessed with Trump you bring him into your classic wow comments. See a therapist about thst addiction buddy. Good luck on the road to recovery. 
---
On topic, yeah you don't pick a spec. That doesn't mean there are no specs. A paladin picking ret talents won't be considered a tank though. A paladin picking prot talents will, even though he's a crap tank in classic. Where do you think the modern idea of specs came from? It's the specializations that the talent trees were designed around. Each tree is a spec, and was even called such (specialization). Get off your high horse, because it's you who reads like a Trump tweet Mr. High And Mighty Know-it-all.
---
&gt;Even when the debuff slot went up, a lot of guilds didn't run a shadow priest until at least ZG because the gear is just not optimized for that spec.
---
But debuff slots only went up at ZG, which is why people started using them. I have never heard about gear being the issue, because they scale terrible throughout entire Vanilla. But Shadow Vuln. makes up for it, even from the start of MC, if you have the debuff 16 slots.
---
&gt; Fury wars and rogues crush a lot harder through MC content, thus why I was saying I bet you're asked to heal. 
---
They crush Shadow priests after ZG as well, it doesn't change anything, as far as I see. 
---
&gt;  But hey, I saw a guild that let a boomkin raid because they liked the  guy. I applaud anything against the min/max norm, just speaking from  what I saw. 
---
The difference is that a Shadow Priest will buff raid damage by more than 1 DPS taking the Shadow Priest's spot could do. A boomkin can't do that. This is only reason you use 1 Shadow Priest in the first place. To buff Warlock damage. In no point of Vanilla does Shadow priests do competitive DPS. It's all about buffing Shadow Damage of Warlocks.
---
Not trying to be rude, but I don't think you understand why people use 1 Shadow Priest in some raids. It was never about their own damage.
---
&gt;defending pure RNG
---
I forgot the stress test is again, but invites did go out on last Thursday after it ended.
---
Not everyone who enjoys Druid lore wants to heal though is entirely the point I'm getting at. You are playing a spec, not a class. If you're playing Priest, you're playing Holy unless you are the 1 Shadow per guild.
---
if you are playing Paladin, you are playing Holy. It's the opposite. You're playing a spec, not a class, because most classes only have one viable spec.
---
Go play bfa and leave our game alone
---
The vanilla guide even says alchemist is the best prof for warriors. What I took back then and what I will take again.
---
Also helps a lot in PvP
---
Tested Cot, Hyjal,top of og, aq uninstanced, If airport, Kara, strath uninstanced should work like on live realm as the are is still untouched
---
Works all fine in beta :)
---
Wow look at all these casuals wanting addons...
---
Auto boost to level 60!
---
Holy shield has it's uses. You can use it to counter fury warrs, rogues and ferals. So don't listen to all the nay-sayers just because it doesn't counter EVERYTHING. Nothing counters everything.
---
That said. I would invest in more str than int, just because int only gives you a bigger mana pool. Sure, if you wanna meme, go for it. But if you want to be useful, go for a prot spec kinda like this  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/As8PBP9QMfQA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/As8PBP9QMfQA)   
---
That way you will deal more damage and have increased longevity.
---
Int is rather useless in classic, since it only increases spell crit(?) and your mana pool, not spell damage.
---
What you should've done was have your atl put one up o. the AH for 5G higher than what you were asking. I use to do this and people would buy my shit so fast thinking they were making saving so much money. I controlled the price. It was glorious.
---
OP you sound like the guy who throws his controller when you die in a game and you have to start over from a really far back checkpoint.
---
Not on german servers :D
---
Y’all really need addons like that in vanilla ? Lol
---
Only one i can really agree with is the Quest item one.  Sometimes the respawn time is absurdly long
---
Or you could just enjoy leveling instead of powerpushing max level. This subreddit literally vomits retail hate and how the leveling is nonexistent there and then these posts come up ...
---
Well, crap. Are we all planning to roll Gnome Mages with Tailoring and Enchanting at launch? It’s starting to feel that way.
---
Even with hamstring up, most of the time, yes he will still attack, but i have high enough armor to do more damage to him than he can do to me
---
What else should warriors wear in Deadmines? Be grateful it's not a rogue tanking.
---
As a mage I can't play fire for the first 2 raids. So you gonna change that also? Some specs are hamstrung because the use debuffs, so are we gonna to nerf all the content even more so they specs can use all their debuffs? What about the effects on other areas of the game like pvp or ablility to solo content which could lead to even more gold inflation?
---
Some people can be both at the same time
---
Literally cannot go tits up.
---
Most professions are a gold sink until they cap out, then they start making money. It's an investment. Everyone here is crazy if they are acting like tons of people wont want enchantments. You might be losing out on the gold of selling items initially, but at 60, the brilliant shards are worth more gold than almost anything you could just sell. You'll make your money back when it matters. 
---
Enchanting is great to have. It's super comforting to know when you pick up an item, you can immediately enchant it to what you want. I hated getting a new weapon and having to search around for not only an enchanter, but an enchanter that had the proper recipe.
---
I can only begin to imagine the stress you put yourself in if you live your entire life taking risks like that
---
As a developer: HAHAHAHHAHAA
---
Get out.
---
everything makes sense but sharting
---
In the beginning of vanilla (if I recall correctly) wand shooting wasn't automatic, and you would shoot once if you would press once. Only later did it become a toggle attack. 
---
About the regen: I know only from a priest perspective, but sometimes you wanded shortly a bit, and otherwise you managed it, downranking earlier or swapping for instance to a different staff with high regen.
---
Easier doesn’t mean better. This is the slop that BFA is at the bottom of now. 
---
The difficulty was part of the experience.
---
It's a joke :)
---
I'd do it at 60 personally. With a strong farming class like mage, the cost of materials from 1-225~ would be cheap compared to your ability to produce gold.  
---
The real downside of enchanting while you level is the relative opportunity cost based on your level. You really need to build up your gold for level 40 and it's even more difficult to do that when you're DE'ing all your greens.
---
You kinda prove my point with your long list of "if" to check.

---
lol what.
---
You should be able to do the run in like 10 mins from zoning in.
---
It was when pre BC arenas released that I abused the fuck out of it. If both multis crit the combo killed anyone.
---
\*Franticly mashes the autoattack button\*
---
Pre raid gear lether is better than plate.
---
Were you able to play until lvl 30? Will the existing character also be playable after the Classic launches?
---
I was so sad when it shut down. Even before that, they only ever played COPS. I miss AoTS, XPlay, and Cheat.
---
One of those needs to go. And it sounds like the latter may actually make you money...you know the choice you’ve gotta make. This is classic wow, after all.
---
If you mine, hold on to most of your stuff in an alt. Engineering is going to be popular, so those mats will inflate in price when everyone hits 60 and starts leveling that up.
---
The best (raiding) warlock DPS spec was a destro/demonology hybrid that used demonic sacrifice. 
---
After the affliction rework, affliction was totally viable too. Possibly better because your survivability was insane. But it’s kinda taxing on the 16 debuff limit lol.
---
I miss the wotlk version of volley. Drop an explosive trap+volley for instant top of the dps chart. Good times.
---
I thought that "ah" sound coming from upstairs
---
Several interesting things in this video:
---
1. Dagger having the strike animation of a 1h Sword.
---
2. Charge being a teleport rather than a rush
---
3. Different running animations
---
4. Different character portraits.
---
Anything more I missed?
---
you know why the monsters are called mobs? because these online mmos are based off MUDS. they were **mob**ile npcs once they agroed. Hmm. I wonder why they use the term "agro"? Because the mob is aggressive towards you? Makes no senses. It was because an agro mob would initiate the battle. Kind of like City Guards to the opposing faction. Nowadays agro is just a state of being attacked.
---
It’s not that bad, just pick double gathering professions and you’ll have enough money for your lvl 40 mount and the occasional blue off the AH to keep yourself updated.
---
I think people LOOK for the rare mobs solo then calls their respective groups to kill it.
---
QoL changes ruined the original game so no.
---
Oh this sounds right up my street. 32 year old vanilla player that used to be somewhat elite when I was younger. I'm not with a newborn and starting a company so simply don't have oodles of time. I play with my bro who also has a kid and were both looking for a competent guild that doesn't expect no-life participation.
---
Here is an obscenely awesome PvP video I made back in the day highlighting my slick editing and ruthless use of thistle tea on unsuspecting horde https://youtu.be/sUJjmeyQ180
---
I'll drop you a message on discord when at my desk.
---
Assuming warriors have 100% uptime of flurry, both classes get the same amount of damage from TF procs, but rogues do benefit more from a fast offhander for poison procs. Also they have Feint+vanish to manage aggro.
---
&lt;**Eminence&gt;** \[NA\] \[H\] \[PST\] is now recruiting for our hardcore Horde Classic Raiding guild! Here at Eminence we are all about preparation and organization to meet our classic wow goals! If you’re like us the hype levels are in overdrive and you’re busying yourself daily with everything possible to make sure you’re ready for classic already… so why not lock down a raid spot in a great community and progression-oriented guild too?
---
A little bit about Eminence? The guild is run by a smaller group Friends who have grown up gaming together along with a couple friends we’ve made along the way. All of us have high level experience across multiple games in addition to WoW, holding top percentile ranks in LoL, Overwatch, Halo, PoE, and others.
---
Eminence’s Officer core is extensively experienced in ALL of classic Vanilla Warcraft, both leading and clearing ALL content from release up to Naxx, as well as high US ranked clears of many tiers of retail WoW between WotLK and Legion. Currently members are still regularly active on pservers. Our discord is always active with people playing misc games and getting to know each other better while we build up our roster for launch!
---
Eminence will be using a EPGP based loot council loot system in order to provide the most fair and streamlined loot in raids.
---
**Recruitment: (Experienced and Dedicated Warriors Needed!)**
---
We are currently recruiting people who are looking to join a Hardcore Raiding Guild/Community and want to get on board early with us during our building phase going into classic! We are a guild who WILL be #1 on the realm we settle on once classic releases. We will be rolling on a PVP realm on the Horde side while aiming for a medium population server. We are looking for dedicated and prepared individuals or groups of people who share the same mindset towards WoW that we do.
---
What exactly are we talking about? Eminence is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience to join us on the path to achieving them. We take raiding seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in between.
---
Overall we are looking for people with DEDICATION and PASSION for classic wow and mastery of their class(es). Chances are if you’re in here reading and made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild this early, you’re the type of person we’re looking for. A lack of high level experience isn’t a deal-breaker but it’s definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail wow experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding Experience.
---
The goal is to build a tight-knit and reliable team of like-minded, committed individuals who want to put maximum effort forth clearing content on the cutting edge and establishing ourselves as a premiere raiding guild. If you are interested in applying or would like to learn more about us please visiteminenceclassic.enjin com
---
We are looking for dedicated Tanks especially, all people of skill should apply (through discord). We are 40+ members strong!
---
**Raid days and times** (subject to minor changes)
---
Tuesday - 6:00-9:30pm PST
---
Wednesday- 6:00-9:30 PST
---
Sunday - 6:00-9:30 PST (cleanup day/ Onyxia if not weekly resets)
---
For more information you can add me or one of my recruitment officers on discord, we would love to chat!
---
Redrick#9438
---
Not sure why you’re downvoted, you’re correct here.
---
Yay I made it to the end!
---
See this is what I thought.
---
Maybe we can file it under the type of bug called 'PServer Madness', and put it up there with Esfand's "SoR doesn't scale with SP, its bugged" bug.
---
LOL
---
That's fine if that's your preference friend.  Your issues is from saying someone else isn't enjoying life because they take vacations other times than summer and are glad summer ends because 102 degree heatwaves are brutal.
---
Sorry you think high school summer vacations are the end all be all of life.  Good on you to enjoy your summers, do it fam.  I don't know why you're in a tizzy that a career can unlock 4 weeks vacation at any point in the year and eventually you'll join the real world and have 365day work, no summer vacations, unless you want to not get paid well and work as a teacher.
---
You don't get it man, he enjoys waiting in lines. He's the dude that goes to the amusement park to sit in a fkin line ...
---
What's coffeine?
---
As a heads up make sure that the class you pick is also available for the other race. For example, if you pick an Orc Shaman and she does Undead Warlock, you should level in the Orc area or your Shaman won't have class quests or trainers.
---
Use a lot of instants when Mana efficiency isn't an issue, which is never!
---
Need? No.  
---
Would like? Yes.
---
Oh my, that was many ifs...
---
Mhm. I'll see if I get around to buying the software, saw it's 4 bucks, but I hate relying on steam for this.
---
I'm amused by the complete lack of Oomkin references.
---
Your speed is likely off. Choose fast.
---
If you know how to play the game, and generally know the quests. But also have a life you like to continue to enjoy, 2 months is a pretty accurate time.
---
I’ve leveled a load of characters before the bc nerf and on pservers. I can get something to 60 within 7 days played usually under 6. 
---
I’m still planning on not hitting max till mid-late October.
---
Lol no I understand how the skill works. I'm just saying that raiding through several of the servers that I can't name because of Automod that shadow priests still weren't a common aspect of many of the guilds raiding. The debuff slot is obviously the larger issue for the initial raids as I didn't know they were starting with 16 on this revamp, but even after that many guilds didn't run it on those unnamed servers. I never played priest as I said, just telling you what I saw and why I made my comment with the empirical evidence I saw while raiding on private servers the last years.
---
There is a reason they haven't caught on for decades
---
&lt;Not Today&gt; - NA - Horde - PvP - PST – Casual
---
Introduction: Not Today is a casual PvP guild that plans to do a little end game raiding. The guild is comprised of members who played together from Vanilla through WotLK. Unfortunately, we are no longer in our 20's nor can we skip work like we did our college courses. Most of us are happily married and have families to provide for.
---
Expectations: Our typical atmosphere is light-hearted and laid back, all the while being competitive (as far as our time restraints permit). We expect everyone to be respectful, but if you suck at being teased every so often, then this probably isn't the guild for you. Raiding is not a requirement, though it is highly encouraged. We will be utilizing Loot Council. In addition to some end game raiding, we plan to spend a majority of our time engaging in PvP.
---
Schedule: Raid nights will likely be Tuesday and Thursday evenings, 7-10 PM PST. This is tentative and can change. The core of us have raided Vanilla through WotLK. Core members are predominately West Coast players.
---
We are looking for like-minded people. Causal, fun and laid back. Albeit short, if this sounds like a good fit, please apply below and we will get back with you shortly.
---

---
-Not Today
---
I received a PM for a mod, the post has been approved! :D
---
"Those who hold back from direct conflict"
---
Idk about that one, they seem to always want to get into direct conflict... especially when I'm at 50% mana and fighting a mob.
---
Even Asmongold’s tanking was on point.
---
Doesn't even mention boomkin lol
---
Again it's subjective. Will you be mostly in groups? Solo? Interested in dps or support? 
---
Each class is valuable for something and has a place. Choose your class and spec based on what role you want, and choose the race depending on what pet peeves you want to counter. 
---
Me? I absolutely LOVE healing in PvP. I will make a dwarf priest to support team members and increase my survivability with Stoneform.
---
I would advise against enchanting on your first character as it is such a gold sink. Have an alt that will make your starter wands. With your main go for gathering professions, and make some gold to help fund leveling enchanting later on.
---
They keep cost low on servers. I mean you can buy a PC that handles 40 WOW games at the same time but you don't buy such a high end computer because it's to expensive for what you want it for right?
---
Do you guys have an idea if you're going to be on a streamer server or not?
---
The Priest/Druid equivalents are also must-have
---
Fair enough. I never played Vanilla WoW so no addons for me to keep it as original as possible
---
Mcconnell joined WSG, there is no layering in that clip. 
---
Nice try though.
---
Why? Because i love my character? I just love to be nice looking  IRL so my Virtual char must be the same.
---
Hunters having the best dps around.... what?
---
Not op, but modern WoW is undeniably harder mechanically speaking. Has always been that way due to tech getting much better in terms of stability and speed. Also players getting better, and since raids got smaller, 40 vs 20, coordination became easier so they had to up the mechanics. 
---
That said, AQ40 and Naxx will knock a lot of guilds down a peg
---
I had a friend in Wrath who blinked and used a movementspeed item while doing zoidbergs woop woop woop everytime something went south.
---
Oh man, are you me? 
---
Was that the jungle you had to get the boat over to? I recall being prisoned by a GM for training goblins to people in my favourite farming spot.
---
Nothing beats male human in that regard tho
---
That's why my hunter got to LVL 59 mountless.  I just used aspect of the cheetah till I had the gold.
---
Fuck it's gonna be hard putting the twins up for adoption. I'm sure someone will take them.
---
RFD is a nightmare with the spiral to the boss.  the body pull is going to be insane.
---
Aiming for late Sept - mid October.
---
Not all QoL changes equally ruined the game though.  Quest item spawns in particular are sometimes absurdly long.  Something like that could be tuned on a case by case basis to be more reasonable.  One thing that comes to mind is the whole dungeon group afking for like an hour while each person picks up a book or some shit.
---
right before he pulled it up he got hosted with 2k veiwers? thats fishy.. in my point of viewe its like they trying to convince all the people that watching that "this person is bad you shouldnt watch him"
---
i can be wrong tho thats just my thought
---
So not even in contested areas?
---
So that also means you can't stop anyone from farming your stuff unless they are flagged?
---
I'm not sure, someone knows of one that would be great
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you new to Classic, and want a supportive, organized guild to provide you with the friendship, advice and backup you’ll need to survive on a PVP server?
---
**Consider &lt;Hurricane&gt;! Here’s what we do:**
---
*Highly disciplined, scheduled weekly city raids; plus the drills and tiresome lectures necessary to bring newbies up to speed on the do’s-and-don’t’s of zerg vs zerg pvp
---
*Support leveling members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
*PVE to PVP - Don’t want to rank? No problem. Once was enough for me, too. 2-3 days a week semi-casual raiding, hours TBA. Modified DKP loot system with class-specific sanity checks.
---
(Sorry, Hunters. You can’t roll on the bindings.)
---
**Who is Hurricane?**
---
Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit. We know what we like, and what we like is a tightly controlled raid, ripping through horde towns. Our culture is strictly old-school - we don’t stand for pettiness, harassment, or the mindless regurgitation of tired memes.
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you, and teach you: how to assist train Horde raids into the dirt, when to spread out and when to tighten up, what actually constitutes “flanking” in a game without collision detection, and how to fight through crowds of Civilian NPC landmines without detonating your weekly ranking on Dishonorable Kills.
---
**Interested? Here’s what we’re looking for in a member:**
---
*Friendly, non-toxic, patient
---
*Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
*Loves world PvP
---
*Communicative Discord voice chat user
---
*Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
&lt;Hurricane&gt; wants to have you - if you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, you’ll be right at home with us. If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla - you’re welcome, and you’re wanted, regardless of where your journey takes you.
---
**If you are interested, join our Discord:**
---
https://discord.gg/wc6HudX
---
This is an entry lobby only - please make yourself known, and myself or an officer will get with you as soon as convenient.
---
Isn't that like every other streamer nowadays?
---
 Clearly you people don't it's just hilarious. The sheep mentality on reddit is amazing. I'm glad you felt the  need to join the herd of morons
---
And like Paladins. No actual taunt.
---
I didn't worry about that too much as a good stunlock opening will let you load all your DoTs without getting hit back, and we ALWAYS rocked weapon chains. 
---
I know some combat rogues to did the "in your face" strategy with BWL weapons and it's pretty cool to see.
---
I want a TBC server in the future.
---
I used to pull into my traps a ton, in early Vanilla. We didn’t have a lot of CC in our group and it helped a bunch.
---
And let’s not forget pulling and kiting General Drakkissath. That’s something we haven’t seen since Vanilla. I wonder if people will still do it.
---
Oh and don't let wardens use hooked net ;)
---
Yep.
---
Intresting, in my experience people who tent to fill in these forms are more intrested and invested into the guild from start. Its a good first "contact" and way of showing who someone is.
---
It also gives more information about someone so there are some topics to start a conversation. We for example have some non serieus questions about who your favorite world leader is. Some fun besides the basic "Tell us about your raiding experience" questions. It opens conversation.
---
Applicants dont need to be scared or judgy about these and just fill these in with some humor. 
---
I've never seen it as a red-flag for douchebaggery. But I've also not taken these forms to serieus.
---
&gt;Hunter " Sustainable DPS is the best in game "
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I like dps, solo, world pvp / bgs. Just trying to find the best possible mix/max class for a race i want to play. Wich is dwarf ,human, nelf.
---
Yeah there isn't a single raid in which Hunter is the top DPS.
---
I see the confusion. I said I leveled "with" a hunter. Not that I leveled a hunter. I played a rogue and my friend leveled a hunter. As we leveled I definitely swapped back and forth depending on what drops I got.
---
Same, I would love this same poster with no errors in HiRes
---
Blizzard wants to decide how we play the game, but only for the launch apparently.
---
Hey, Pat got pretty close when he made his video.
---
RIP Sessler
---
The best was pre WotLK Ret Paladin buffs. You literally could take on 1 v 3 and win. In arenas. Divine storm was so incredibly broken lol
---
w0w good 4 him
---
No they said they are creating new server names for classic
---
Ziqo's laugh is the cure to streamer cancer.
---
in Vanilla i was ridiculously slow, no addons, no goal just dicking around most of the time and I still hit 60 in 8 days 3 hours played on a warrior one of the slowest levelers around, so 8 days would not really be fast.
---
Well that's cool, because I'm also a developer. In particular, I'm working with cloud computing, which is exactly what Blizzard is using to run their servers.
---
They can absolutely get better performance than they could in 2004. People just don't believe it because they don't see it, because Blizzard wants to keep their costs as low as possible.
---
r/expectedthanos 
---
Upvotes to the left
---
That is basically 99% confirmed (assuming classic does well).
---
Stick up the bum
---
I would be suprised if priests were not around 90% dwarves in classic on the alliance side. Fear ward is so good, it is not even close.
---
Honestly that's likely it, my little brother is 19 and he played vanilla quite a bit. Never left a starting zone once, but he did in fact play vanilla lol.
---
LOOKING FOR GUILD
---
Hi, I am a long time WoW player who stopped playing late in legion due to graduating. (I just got Beta!)
---
Now I am looking for a guild that will 
---
1) Go hard in classic. 
---
2) Is Rooted in retail 
---
3) Plans on raiding a minimum of 9 hours a week when enough content is available. 
---
4) NA
---
5) Alliance
---
I've played all expansions except BFA and most of MoP. I have always been a Mythic (or heroic in LK/MOP) raider and very much enjoy min-maxing.
---
In legion I was one of the head theory crafters for Resto Druid and the author of Resto Druid Stat Weights (the precursor to the HSW addon).
---
I am also a UI enthusiast. making UI's like this one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NdQfOKQj5E
---
Please respond with the name of your retail guild and what your expectations are for leveling/raiding.
---
My class interests are Prot Warrior, Fury Warrior, Rogue, Holy Priest, Holy Paladin.
---
Though I am leaning towards Warrior and Rogue as these were my vanilla classes
---
&gt; Warriors are great tanks, but they suck to level. Hunters are easy to level but they suck in endgame raids. That's a fair trade-off in my opinion.
---
It's not a fair trade-off at all IMO. The leveling thing will matter just for the first month of gameplay for warriors. For hunters, the lack of scaling will last for years.
---
Nobody cares, it's not new.
---
So PvE you just wave and let everyone have fun, and there is no fight for mobs unless both flag for it (but that also means that they can steal your stuff). Did I get that correct?
---
**&lt;Thralls Deep&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Raid times:** 8pm Formation, 830 First pull - 1130pm EST Wednesdays/Thursdays. 3 Hour raids max
---
**About:** Thralls Deep has a veteran group of leaders who have cleared most, if not all content in vanilla from private servers. We plan on raiding, ranking and hosting guild events throughout the life of Classic! We are looking for players who are looking to rank and have quick, clean and efficient raids.
---
**Recruitment:** We are recruiting everyone and all classes. We are looking for players who want to step up and be at the top of their game.
---
**Loot:** Loot council rewarding those who preform. If you are at the top of the meters you will be rewarded.
---
**PvP:** We planning on ranking as well as hosting premades to be the top Horde premade on the server competing with the Alliance.
---
**Info:** If you are interested, feel free to message myself on reddit, or leadership on discord for more information.
---
Jugo#1329 Colbzzzz#9219 Crunchy#7762 Trance2000#5310
---
So the biggest factor is the mob density and environment, not the actual races themselves.
---
Neat.
---
has there been any absurd quest item spawns so far though? I've only seen ones that take like 10 seconds
---
To be a meme spec naxx raider. You need all the "If's" to allign. Its a small chance.
---
I had that, it was nice.  I forgot all about it.
---
IF someone is rolling a Druid just to be in cat form, they should be rolling a rogue.
---
I have never touched Everquest but I believe blizzard said that they sort of intended to create something similar to Everquest but more playable for casual players. 
---
If you’re wondering about time investment, 1-60 can take an experienced player 96-120 in game, efficient played hours, and an inexperienced player 240+ in game hours. Then after that it’s time to gear up, farm, and do raids, and pvp
---
Hunters have other benefits at endgame too, just not so much in raiding.
---
Not in other MMO’s.
---
True progressive itemization. Remove battle.net chat. Don't want people messaging cross faction. No sharding/layering. Just make a ton of servers. Niche things like old tier set models and the unarmored mounts. Give us double on use trinkets and nerf them at the appropriate patch. Let windfury proc off itself. Little things that go a long way. The old thunderfury proc that was overpowered. I could go on.
---
Charge your phone!
---
Enchanting is probably the most lucrative end game. It's also the most expensive to level. If you have a group that'll help you get the D/E fodder, it'll be better though
---
Hey! Thanks guy!
---
Only if you have a great healer. You will have a very hard time doing a full clear with a 2H tank and an average healer unless you have tons of CC or overlevel it by a bit.
---
Not really, no.
---
How did they know? Did they receive a mail that they can play Classic as long they renew their subscription?
---
We will be trying to avoid streamer servers.
---
Better performance yeah, easily handle? No.
---
Dominos works for me.
---
Why not add lfg and lfr while st it?
---
How did your friend know he had beta access without having his subscription active? By mail?
---
I think most of them are dungeon quest items.  and iirc the gem you get from the wardrobe in teldrassil has a pretty long respawn timer.  im sure theres others though.  Just what i can remember off the top of my head.  This may even end up being a non issue after the first month or so after the population spreads out.  The beta will probably give good data on that
---
But silverpine has the cool spooky area with the worgens howling at night!
---
I was wondering if the 2h "Darkstone Claymore" would be available on launch, seems like a good option but i'm unsure when the twilight cultists were added/if they'll be in phase one. 
---
Could be a good option is someone could confirm but i'm unsure.
---
Not that I disagree with you but I suspect the lack of unarmored mounts is more to do with the fact they were never intended rather than exclusivity.
---
Anyone know how to filter by author?
---
I came here to dislike at you
---
Stress test is level 5 only.  Beta characters are only playable in beta. https://www.wowhead.com/news=291829/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-22nd
---
Anyone know when brd wardens got hooked net? Assuming it's going to be in classic.
---
Yes, TBC arenas were super fun
---
Literally anyone that played before cata has done this.
---
Dang. Thanks for the info. I guess it’s good to have a totally fresh start though.
---
It's be faster, that's for sure. Idk who told you faster means better.
---
You can't joke with me im too fast I'll catch it.
---
So you managed to get a Warrior to actually show up with a shield to a low level dungeon and you're complaining?
---
I don’t think you know how layering works. Layering puts an entire servers population in a single layer. These layers will eventually condense down to a single server. 5x the aoe farming spots does not matter when there is 5x the total population fighting over them, layering or no layering
---
have fun leveling in Teldrassil!
---
This
---
I'm not opposed to unarmored mounts, it would be kinda cool.
---
Yikes.
---
Wf totem is REALLY good for the tank group to help with aggro generating.
---
Haha sadly you are mistaken! Fuck missing with a 2 hander.
---
I literally talk about how you should do what you enjoy in this video, but if you want to get ahead of the pack you shouldn't blindly follow guides.
---
How can you push doing what you want with the same toxicity people use against non minmaxers?
---
Yeah and mana totem is better for healers and casters.
---
Blizzard said that they don't want them because new players would want to rush to 60 (which is what most players will do anyway).
---
To be fair, that's probably better than being optimistic. If you are told you will finish twice as fast as you actually are going to, those last 20 levels will feel pretty bad I would imagine. They seem very off and like a complete waste of time though, pretty hard to calculate all the variables without having records of every scenario already done.
---
the trick is to not pull the quilboar camp, just grind on easier to kill mobs
---
I'm not sure a free action potion counts as a "gimmick"
---
Warrior slowest? I think that needs a little defending...
---
&gt; So you’d rather not play the game at all in the first month?
---
People played the game just fine back then.
---
People played in privates that have 10k+ peopleonline at the same time.
---
It won't be unplayed. Layering is not necessary at all.
---
yeah ret pally can heal 60 dungeons, you people are hilarious
---
It's true, and it doesn't really specifically say hunters are doing the sustainable damage :'D
---
As a brand new player this is how I saw my action bar when I ignored dungeons until lvl 40 and used the same three attacks all game..
---
Anyone else remember that pvp video of the prot pally who had a 100% thorns + holy shield build? He’d just drop consecration and let 5 rogues break themselves upon his shield.

I remember it being a super niche build that he made work.

Oh god

Even seeing them as someone who didn't get to have them would be cool.

Grow up. Who the fuck cares?
---
Mount goes same speed.
---
Hunter and warlock pets don't scale at all in 1.12 vanilla.
---
No!
---
I never drank mage piss on my hunter... ever.
---
pserver guild maybe? in vanilla i would get around 10 whispers a raid for a hp stone when my guild was clearing mc and bwl
---
If it's anything like EQ progressive servers it will be new named servers along side the retail servers.
---
0%
---
It's doable even with a job/school. Just need to give up all other aspects of your life.. maybe have time on the weekends to grocery/gym..
---
And believe me, I'm the last person that would shit on anyones enjoyment. I am a completionist. I want to find everything out about every quest - but this is strictly for capitalizing on the first wave of content. Like I say in the very first sentence of the video.
---
I  loved them all.
---
I really we get to this point so I can play OP resto druid in 2v2s :p
---
&gt; No, because I’m going to be a healer which is more rewarding than trying to push mediocre DPS out of a subpar spec and sinking tons of gold in the process while Mages and Locks have a priority on gear over me.
---
&gt; Most of you Spriest wannabes are going to end up as healers. :)
---
Did some SP hurt you when you were young? What's all this passive aggressiveness, this class/spec bashing is insane.
---
See you in 5 months rolling on every mount that drops and being sad that you didn't get it.
---
Won't be a thing on live classic though :(
---
Stop premoting these people, no one cares! If they cared enough they probably already follow them.
---
I played vanilla. Also this isn't early vanilla again. There are a lot of ways to play the game now. 
---
I invite you to actually try a warrior, instead of just listening to what other ppl tell you about them. If you play the game like shit, every class you play will feel like shit. Get good.
---
The game being difficult is what makes it so rewarding.
---
If you mean other classes are doing it, then duh, but it's still wrong to put it in the Hunter box.
---
If you mean the pet is, even if your pet had 100% uptime ( and they rarely do ) you would not out DPS a geared Rogue/Warr/Warlock
---
...it isn’t as though all the players of Crushridge in 2004-06 were going to be forced to play on Crushridge Classic...
---
The only common thread would be the name, a server is the server it is because of the people on it.
---

Druid tanking requires farming +armor gear, which is a long grind as well.  If you're going to roll a druid you'll probably end up healing at least part of the time, which is why I ultimately stopped playing my druid in Vanilla.  I'm the world's worst PvE healer and I found warrior tanking to be a lot more engaging.
---
Warriors are actually one of the easier classes to gear before raids because finding dungeon groups isn't hard if you're willing to tank. The primary draw back of casually playing a warrior is the large number of warriors in raids which makes gearing a very long process at the raid level.
---
I can't speak to playing a rogue since PvE wise I never really enjoyed the class.  Wonderful world PvP class though.
---
&gt;You should be able to do the run in like 10 mins from zoning in.
---
If you have Naxx gear then whats the point of farming Ironfoe? Obviously I am talking preraid gear. And nope. Just running from entrance to Lyceum is 5min alone. Emperor room takes at least 10 min to clear and that was when I pulled as fast as possible with the average DPS you find.
---
You have to keep in mind that casters have no reason running Emperor more than once for their quest. That means almost every group you are in will be 1 Tank, 3 melee with no aoe cleave, and a healer.
---
Druid - normal - 20 hours = 15 december? 3,6 months for real?
---
Lost both last year. I‘m prepared for Classic ;)
---
So unless i'm mistaken you're saying that demons and pets get 0 improvement from owner's
---
SP/RAP in 1.12?
---
Sometimes it takes a shart to make you finally take a shower
---
I don't have Civ 5 but stuff like this is always awesome to see!
---
Wheres the mountain dew holder?
---
Everyone knows this.
---
T2 cover all content (and looks good)  
---
Main hand - Lok'amir il Romathis   
---
Reckoning -  Halberd of Smiting
---
Off hand - ???
---
It's the same as when you try to play the game with no active sub on retail.
---
I never said I wouldn't enjoy the game when it launches, and take my time. In fact I probably will. But if I was playing hours and hours out of the beta and enjoying the content, because it is forced to be slowed down, when the actual release came I probably would not play the same way just because Id can. Id probably lvl a lot faster.
---
no thats normie level  
---
you just wipe yourself with soiled pants, throw them in the sink and go get new ones  
---
clean for another week
---
These are the things I'm wondering. At specific patches certain items, spells, or combinations proved to be OP and had to be nerfed in later patches. So if something was OP at the time of 1.12 would it be in classic or would they make sure those things were at nerfed later patch version.
---
Probably. But why th can't he put "normal and healthy" sport activities aside for a week, if he decided to nolife, restrict sleep etc.
---
AM (ante meridian) is 00:00-11:59, the period from exactly midnight to just before midday
---
PM (post meridian) is 12:00-23:59, the period from exactly midday to just before midnight
---
So 12:00am on August 27 is 00:00, which is exactly the same as 24:00 on August 26.
---
I'm pretty sure since Classic is based on future game architecture that you're gonna have to wait. It's only now that addons are really showing up in the beta, as they all needed to be reworked for the new client
---
Because nobody cares about PVE so they just put that in there as an option.
---
if you don't care then you should be fine if they implement it?
---
I think you’re overrating how hardcore the general playerbase is. The average classic player will be far more live and let live than the consensus on communities like this. 
---
My experience on pservers definitely did not have 90% dwarf priests, and my expectation is that the average pserver player cares more about that kind of stuff. There will be more dwarves than in vanilla, sure, but I saw nearly as many humans and nelves tbh. My own raid group had a problem where we only had 1 dwarf most of the time, sometimes more, sometimes none. My own alt is a dwarf priest, and if I play one in classic I will of course go dwarf, but a lot of people just don’t enjoy that race enough to pick it for fear ward.
---
Fear ward is kind of a crutch anyway, I’m not going to be the one calling for non-dwarf priests to be kicked, when the time comes.
---
Maybe I’m wrong and it will be 90%. Probably in the most hardcore guilds it will be. But the general server population? Most of those players won’t even browse this Reddit, let alone dive deep into minmaxing or optimal racials. Most people just log in and play. 
---
I’m tempted to !RemindMe 110 days to see who was right
---
You will probably need a new client.  iirc theyve done alot of network code updating etc that won't be in the old client.
---
very relevent to a lvl ~20 running DM
---
At 60: Warrior, Hunter, Warlock, Rogue, Priest, Druid, Paladin, Shaman is how I see it shaking out.
---
Unrealistic AF, you're playing a ret paladin; you dont need that many buttons.
---
It isn't they've never confirmed this and the logistics of it seems improbable. They would have to develop a mechanic to allow players to move characters over when retaining population and faction balance. And at what point do they stop? Do they have a separate stand alone game for every expansion?
---
What's far more likely is they expand upon World of Warcraft Classic. Possibly an alternative timeline or new content but from a Buisness stand point a separate TBC Server option is incredibly unlikely. Granted that's not saying they include Outland in the new timeline. Just that it won't be an exact replica.
---
Charge your phone
---
We are a brand new guild with a lot of raid experience all the way back to WoW classic back in '04/'05 up to and including Naxx40. All slots are currently available and we look forward to seeing you help us grow into one of the top guilds on our selected server.  
---
Loot system: Our loot system will be determined utilizing the opinions of all members when we get closer to that time. We want to use a system that is both fair but also doesn't discourage minor upgrades in favor of "hording" points for that one item everyone really wants. We're leaning towards a decaying DKP system but want to make sure it's a good fit.

Too bad they didn't just switch over to a web format and do Youtube or something when they shut down. Obviously copyright issues would get in the way, so it wasn't really possible, but just imagine. They would basically be Pewdiepie instead, imo.
---
are you interested?
---
for tanking? thought that was only for DPS warriors
---
already got 50+ of these on repeat as a wallpaper. absolutely love them
---
In a interview they literally said "We are open to it." If classic does well I'm 100% sure blizzard will chose to invest the small portion(compared to what they have to put in for a new expansion) to release TBC and make a shit ton more money.
---
People used addons in Vanilla. I know I did.
---
I mean, I agree. A few changes wouldn't hurt nobody. Another good one would be to add in Death Nights and Monks. I like my Death Knight, and he deserves to be in Classic WoW. It just a little change afterall. Won't hurt nobody. My monk would also like to be in classic. Another change that would hurt nobody. Now that I think about it, I am also missing my Demon Hunter. I think it would be in the games best interest to add in my Demon Hunter as well. Afterall, its just a small change if you think about it. It won't hurt nobody. Death Knights, Demon Hunters and Monks were all good additions to WoW, so its a good idea to bring them back for Classic. Were trying to make Classic WoW as great as possible, arent we? There are plenty of things we are missing that we could bring back to make Classic the greatest game ever! 
---
I just wear 10 layers of tear-away pants. Each shart I just tear them away
---
Also how questing was done. Just walk up and right click. From my time on Everquest that was not how questing was then.
---
go play retail then
---
yes after 5 minutes or something the EFC showed on the map. I remember this too.
---
only pick enchanting if you really, really hate yourself OR you're committed to getting good recipes and spamming trade chat to make up the cost of leveling
---
imagine thinking you won't be fighting over mobs even with layering
---
Definitely exaggerated on this sub. Once the mechanics are properly explored and you're a decent player it's quite clear that they can level faster than rogues and paladins.
---
\&gt; mage piss 
---
shit, he's onto us !
---
Yeah I really hope it gets made haha. I won't be using addons like UI or any of that, just want combo points!
---
The 1.12 client and ALL of the addons that work on it are incompatible with the Classic client.
---
The difference is, any other classes rotation is just a rotation, you press the buttons in the correct order and that's it. For Hunter it's the same except you have to precisely time the abilities or else your Auto-Shot gets canceled, which results in a huge DPS loss.
---
&gt;Warlock pets, specifically in PVP have a much higher skill ceiling, with more utility spells etc.
---
&gt;Just because you are a hunter doesn't make them the HARDEST class to master. 
---
I explained in detail why they are, none of the reason was "because I play hunter". They objectively have the highest skill cap in vanilla WoW, I don't understand why this makes you feel attacked. That doesn't mean any class is braindead easy to master, just that hunter is the hardest to master.
---
You can have your shitty mounts when I can have Old AV.
---
&gt; Classic has them on a ~20s respawn timer 
---
Honestly thank fuck for that!
---
Of course! 
---
I’m road tripping. So all I can do is read and discuss the game instead of actually playing lol
---
Still think you underestimate what "most players" is.
---
Even those passionate about Classic, a lot of them have full time jobs now AND a relationship. There is no way to no life Classic while having both of those. Even with a full time job that's pretty hard to no life, but possible.
---
Still, the majority of players will not be completing Molten Core in the first month.
---
Subreddits are never an accurate representation of the player base due to volume.
---
yeah but then how is he supposed to complain about layering
---
I’m of the opinion that exercise is beneficial for WoW performance and endurance. Strong body, strong mind, and it’s a slippery slope to start restricting healthy options just for more WoW time. Sure it seems like OP is doing just that, but it looks like he has 7hrs timetabled sleep per day, which is enough for an adult.
---
It opens a whole can of worms if they start making little non-1.12 type changes.  They'll have to give in to every other little change people cry about.
---
8set t2 off the top of my head
---
So that's all well and good, but without putting it into relation to the other healers, I have no context for this. Are they bottom line still worse than all the others?
---
yes it is, that's why i'm having problems. my old druid back during vanilla had purple hair, but i'm going Priest because of how boring restoration is outside of PvP and turquoise seems to fit the Priest tier sets better.
---
Combo point add ons? Please god!
---
Hamstring kiting takes advantages of using the slowest 2hander you can find and outranging the mob while waiting for your swing timer. Rogues can't use 2 handers and so there's no point.
---
Thanks for doing this. I saw a bug on stream where 2 hunters marks were stacking on a mob during a dungeon ( I think they were using different ranks of mark). Can you test this with another hunter and report it if its really stacking?
---
Your delusional. You honestly think a random private server launch is on the same scale as this? There’s gonna be a 1/4 million people playing this at launch. You rly think blizz is rolling out 100 servers? 
---
I’m willing to bet the server techs that work at blizzard/activison have a lot of experience with this then a random no name redditor. Seriously, who are you, what market research, analytics, data have you collected to make a statement like 
---
“Layering is no needed”
---
The unarmored mounts were not available for purchase in 1.12.
---
We’re playing 1.12.
---
If you get 4 or more TFs in the space of one vanilla server cycle, you’re a god.
---
Most guilds will have 3/4 warrior tanks. I’d argue each of them has more justification for TF than your rogue.
---
ha, i already have a character i like, but the hair color is causing me struggles.
---
Lmao bad troll
---
Most warriors will be DPS. Leveling as a tank is idiotic and you can easily tank everything with a dps spec until 60.
---
And DM is easily tanked in leather (or mail without a shield).
---
Honestly, 6 hours a day doesn’t seem too bad st all for the first couple weeks of an MMO launch. People play this game A LOT
---
I would love you long time if you'd turn some of these into lockscreen videos for phones such as s8, s9, s10.
---
It's from a private server AFAIK which as a source isn't substantially better than an ass is.
---
Thanks, you can keep it on the top of your head if you'd like
---
Well, not all 3 rogue specs are good. What if a certain spec intrigues them more than the other?
---
I still think it's the opposite. You aren't playing the class. You are playing a spec.
---
Yeah lol, now if you even slightly express a dislike for layering/sharding you are immediately roasted for it. Funny how the tables have turned...
---
So much hate for blizzard, less than a year ago, then it turned into "thank you, but prob going to mess it up." Now its "blizzard you are the best, do whatever you feel like, I know your doing a good job, and everything right."
---
&gt;yeah ret pally can heal 60 dungeons, you people are hilarious
---
Any 5man in Vanilla can be done by a group that dont spec even a single talent point into anything assuming they are even semi competent at their class.
---
We are in 2019 and you still think Vanilla dungeons are hard content? Lmao
---
There is no way phase one only lasts one month. 
---
And even if it's not possible for everyone to get them why should it? All of the rare mounts in the game are not going to be obtained by most people. The unarmoured mounts would at least give the "nolifers" something to show off.
---
They usually fall behind other healers during MC and BWL by about 5-10% depending on random factors.
---
They catch up with and surpass other healers for certain fights during AQ40 and Naxxramas.
---
Like I said, they catch up to other healers and start to shine in the late game.
---
You should watch the VOD of the SM Cath run from the hunters perspective too, Themechanic streams... Sorry but you are delusional if you think their role was easy, the entire dungeons length they had to kite one or several mobs while DPSing another at the same time. A mediocre hunter would have died a lot doing this.
---
You can absolutely have a green shield by 18-19.
---
Sometimes they quest reward a single item that's usable by 3 classes.
---
Getting ahead of the rest in WoW... you mean a divorce and disowning my children. Moving out and spending all my cash on low cost food/living quarters and buying a proper computer. 
---
... Or maybe play WoW classic casually... maybe even more casual than when i was a noob.
---
Chaaaange?
---
That one dude left SW, everyone else still there.
---
Yet the way riding skill will work is from before 1.12
---
He's speedrunning wow leveling, what did you expect?
---
Will be playing rogue. Around 20 hours a week at normal pace.
---
I will ding level 60 on the 25th of December. Merry Christmas y'all!
---
Why isn't the halbard of smiting included in this picture?
---
They are trying to dissuade people from having 40% of the pop playing warrior
---
Crushridge is still a server in Retail. 
---
Classic will need all new names.
---
I tried it and got lgm armorsmith as well as a 50 sham. Honestly my pain was that the population was EU and I'm US so I couldn't really pvp in emain after all that time. I'd probably still be playing it if the population was healthy during the time I played. Finding only two other 8 mans after 2 hours of running around isn't exactly thrilling.
---
There was a pretty crazy relic raid with thousands of people early on that was amazing though.
---
I leveled almost 2 warriors to 60 back in the day. I didn’t think it was painful at all. I would agree the first few levels you will die a lot. Other than that it’s fine really.
---
I’d say it’s exaggerated.
---
It's called "warcry"
---
To each, their own when it comes to addons. :)
---
Vanilla was never hard.  This isnt a question of when it was harder. I didnt spend alot of time doing low level dungeons. Last time i did any sort of leveling was around 1.6.  
---
There is no proof of nerfs. Just like mage ignites used to not have a stack limit. But tjat didn't mean it didnt happen.   
---
By 1.12 end game content was nerfed.  That was never hard either. But this is just lol
---
r/me_irl
---

---
Halbard of smiting. I remember that procing off itself and then off the seal of command proc and that the proc proc'ed proc'ing another proc of the halbard. I have screenshots of 7 and 8 proc attacks off one swing. I love that halbard as a paladin.
---
I don’t have an answer, just was wondering what eye tracking is? I’ve never heard of it, is it just your cursor being where your eyes are looking?
---
I don't play Alliance much, but isn't that the teleport/buff animation the warlock is using to cast shadowbolts and shit, or was he just spam overlapping dots and they have a different animation than cast time spells? There are like 3 pixels, so it's hard to see.
---
I have an eye tracker and haven't used it on WoW, I'll give it a shot and let you know
---
Let's not.
---
Those are your main abilities but of course you have tons of other abilities as a hunter, and you also need to time most of these correctly so that they don't cancel your auto-shot. Also, walking or any movement at the wrong time cancels your auto-shot too, you have to do your running away from the enemy for an exact amount of seconds between each arrow shot by auto-shot.
---
Exactly. Your pet's stats will be the same from the moment you ding 60, all the way to naxx
---
Love Asmon, but refusing to click this due to shitty click bait style video.
---
this was probably written around launch before warlocks had anything.
---
Oh yeah it was removed by 1.12 right?
---
Yeah after a while you just didn’t get these kinds of weird effects anymore either, every proc became generic and boring for balancing purposes
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
the biggest issue with retail is their fucking obession with the rng fiesta. titanforging, rolling sockets, then the azerite gear adding to that was ugh. imo atleast
---
Theres only one way to play, and I'm sure you already know how...
---
&gt; from playing on private servers
---
Because you're not using the official blizzard client, you will need to download their client. As well as use addons that have been built off of blizzard's api.
---
I played uthgarde 2 years ago on launch and it was so awesome seeing thousands of people run around DAOC again. Only got my Skald to level 30 as a solo player, though, before the grind started to feel oppressive.
---
I laugh because that's my wife playing the mage.
---
It will be the 1.12 version.
---
On both the two biggest servers atm, the proc rate is 4%. It used to be 10% on them years ago, but it was nerfed as there are sources that point to lower proc rates.
---
No. I got into the beta on the first Monday of the beta (like 4-5 days into the closed beta) . I found out by spam restarting my bn client. Hadn't gotten an email to this day.
---
And there were definitely some animations that resembled jizzing a time or two along the way.
---
Dunno, I feel perfect with some 15 minutes of walk, while 6-7 hours of sleep mean a terrible feeling all day... 
---
But whatever, I think OP should be more consistent. Either nolife hard or not nolife at all, IMO.
---
TWO ~~SCOOPS~~ MOONS!
---
Plus pet food, feelshunterman
---
Yes but why would you think private servers would want those stones any less?
---
is there any worth playing private server? the hype is killing me
---
This is why so many raid leads played warrior in vanilla lmao.
---
Yeah. Elemental is a fairly common raidspec. Especially for content that is on farm.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo&amp;t=440s
---
Nice joke, its roughly 4% proc rate and it can't proc from itself or other extra attacks.
---
It's still a good weapon, but not overpowered.
---
&gt;layer hopping exploits
---
Are incredibly hard to do properly assuming they fix relogging keeping you in the same layer. Layers are limited and targeting them requires people on them that invite you - which don't know on which layer they are because they're not "named".
---
&gt; players phasing in/out all over the world. 
---
Layering is not sharding. People are never phasing unless taking group invites, so basically never. The majority of players is not accepting a group invite every 10 seconds. People will stay where they are.
---
&gt; only guarantee that layers will be gone by phase 2 is blizzards word which isn't worth dirt 
---
So what makes you believe that they'll even release it? What makes you believe they won't cut phases into 2? What makes you believe they'll not suddenly force you to pay a different sub?
---
If you believe from the start that the devs are lying you've lost anyway as nothing is ever real. By the way, so far everything Blizzard said was true. They only changed from sharding to layering, that's it.
---
Amazing in solo PvP (Can easily 1v3 at any level, most poeple will just run from you)
---
Meh in group PvP (premades will probably prefer other comps, but who knows, metas change)
---
Great in 5mans (esp when paired w/ rdruid)
---
Trash in raids (Guilds will prefer a healer spec into shadow rather then taking a dedicated SP because of low dmg caused by mana issues in long term fights)
---
Undead is usually the play. 
---
Very fun to play, if you are ok with healing in raids, then go for it. I would choose race based on personal prefrence rather then min/max figures.
---
Mmmm the glorious double windfury. Paying shaman was like sitting at a slot machine. Occasionally things would just fall over dead in 1 attack.
---
No. Private servers have the mace set to 4% Procrate. What I want to know is where the 20% number is coming from because it's being mentioned everywhere with no source.
---
Never played UD priest, but I assume you use it in combination with inner focus.
---
[Never forget.](https://youtu.be/xzYOqIFYaOY)
---
I think it’s good if you want to practice your leveling route (if you speedrun). For testing classes and messing around at 60 RetroWow is a good choice

**&lt;Maelstrom&gt; NA-PvP Alliance guild recruiting more players for Classic. We’re a serious progression guild that will have 2-3-night raid schedule. T/W/TH @ 8pm central time.** 
---
**For the past few months we have been playing together on our own test server. So far, we have been clearing MC/Ony/ZG/AQ20 with 20-30 people.** 
---
**Currently we’re looking for players that can participate in our Tuesday test raids. We would like to expend our core roster to at least 35 players so we can start doing runs in BWL and beyond.** 
---
**Hpriest / Hpaladin are in highest demand, but we’re always looking for skilled players of all classes.**

The shallow water between Teldrassil and Darkshore looks pretty silly. Maybe make it wider than 1 tile.

Rookies, you pounce them in combat and let the mob kill them for their durability repair.
---
They are talking a out 3 layers lmao what are you even on about
---
This needs to be at the top of this subreddit. Truly an incredible playlist.
---
OP, thank you so much for this. I’ve had wallpaper engine for a while but haven’t done much with it since the day I purchased it. I just removed all my wallpapers and set a playlist with every one you made. Each one is stunning and my classic hype is at max now.
---
An alternative to buffing the content is for players to relax their compulsive tendencies to min/max all the difficulty away.
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...

Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**​Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

Screenshot this and send it to blizz, you're officially an Influencer™ now
---
And you just wasted your time
---
You said pre-raid leather is better than plate or mail though, I don't think that's true for tanking? You didn't say "leather will do" but "leather is better"
---
Good luck and have fun! :)
---
and remember in vanilla so your hand of justice can proc and windfury which can proc your extra hit thrash blade which can procc your sword spec extra which can procc windfury etc. etc.
---
such a sad day when the removed this in TBC it was funny as hell to run 2s arena in tbc go in with a normal hit and the target died from all the proccs.
---
It’s an immaterial change. I wasn’t bothered in life before the question was posed, I’m unbothered by blizzards response. The only thing I am bothered by is people who incessantly make forum posts begging for non gameplay decisions to be reverted by blizzard.
---
Everyone wants old mounts, some want old talents. Know what I never see nostalgia begging posts over? The old t2 set skins and drop locations. Everyone is A-okay with that change (which does carry gameplay ramifications—it’s blizzlike for the first raiding guilds to get t1 and t2 in mc).
---
This is on par with raging over the shadows being off on the character creation screen, or the characters not turning their head while targeting a mob and strafing. 
---
Is the goal to preserve the gameplay or the art? IF the art, fuck classic wow, let’s just add in more tmogs to retail. IF the gameplay? Then focus on issues that affect gameplay—focus your energy and forum ranting into that. Not a Reskin on a mount. SMH, wanting mount reskins is the most retail Cata baby bullshit I’ve heard today.
---
I remember people vanishing before my eyes on vanilla. Now that layering is in though it’s gonna be layerings fault every time.
---
BG queue pop? Nope layering. Group summoned him maybe? Nope layering.
---
You can queue by yourself, and one person can start the queue as well for the whole group (Not everyone needs to be at the NPC.)
---
However, queueing alone you should expect to get roflstomped. Premades going to be running rampant.
---
Yes pretty much, essentially there's no wPvP unless you flag for it. So if someone wants to farm and not get ganked, they won't flag.
---
wPvP still happens its just on your own terms. You'll still get TM vs SS battles and what-not but if someone wants to farm without getting ganked there isn't much you can do other than fight over tags. It'd be like competing against a fellow faction member for the farming spot.
---
Thanks for all the advice! I usually don’t care about min/max and go for rule of cool but because so many specs weren’t viable in vanilla I was more worried this time around. Thanks for the help :)
---
It used to be just chat don’t know if they’ll have it like that for new classic or not
---
You might be right. Thinking back I might had used drain life a lot and thus buffed that. I honestly can't recall exactly, I would need to play it again to figure it out again. Soon.
---
If they truly don’t want people to rush, then why not just put them in and leave them in?  Then there’s no rush.
---
My personal feeling is they held these back for a different reason.  Maybe saving these jewels for a cash shop down the road?
---
I don’t recall having a problem with green chain and shield by 17. But it’s been a while, maybe my memory is foggy.
---
Too bad bag space is at such a premium, I might consider showing up in white leathers for kicks and switch just before first pull.
---
Right. I guess that was a stupid question, haha. I haven’t played since cata so I wasn’t sure if they still used the old server names.
---
Thanks! I appreciate it, man!
---
holy shit this is amazing
---
I think you underestimate how many players are relying on their memories. Even many guides tell you that speccing arms is the way to go in order to maximize threat.   
---
You are making the mistake of assuming that people know when exactly Shield Slam was buffed. If you ask around, many would say BC

---
ok, I think now I got it, thanks for your patience. :)
---
Yeah. Fair enough, I didn’t realize all the original server names were still in use for retail.
---
Honestly I don't think they would fuck the same game in the ass twice. I think classic will be successful enough for them to realize that not every game needs a cash shop.
---
Doesn't seem right.
---
For fun, I selected Mage, 70 hours a week, fast (using guides)
---
It still has it at 3 weeks to hit level 60? That wouldn't be accurate.
---
Talk to your guild leader.
---
It’s tier 3 no?
---
I’m wrong oops
---
Basically. What I want to know is if you can get it to move your cursor around the screen and then use some sort of voice macro controller to cast spells for you. Ive seen it done in space sims and want to see if it is viable for wow as well.
---
Can you like get banned again please ?
---
Isn’t Beast Mastery Hunter the optimal PvP spec and Marksman Hunter the optional PvE spec
---
In vanilla premades were very rare. At least 90% of matches were pub vs pub. It will be interesting to see how popular premades (and queue dodging) are in Classic but no one knows yet.
---
You're very right! Not the shadowbolts per say but absolutely the pose is the buff/heal pose and not the dot pose. Good find!
---
what does the colour of the shield have to do with tanking?
---
I don't even know what this guide is talking about. It can't even be instances either because the warlock portion suggests using an infernal. An ability that can only be used outdoors. Then the doting everything part just being a terrible strategy in PvP, what with all the cc breaking you would be doing. That whole section is just a mess.
---
I'd say it was PvP, but there's portions that specifically say PvE. Then there's the part about hunters sustained damage being the best. It just flat out isn't, and never was. Maybe in the alpha when they had focus, like you said the game changed a lot through patches.
---
I have sub, but no bfa, only legion. Can I be invited to the stress test?
---
No worries. It boils down to whether you want to be able to gank anyone you come across, or if you're someone who just wants to quest in peace. Former go PvP, latter go PvE. 
---
The tilt is heavily favored to PvP servers. If you have the time to deal with the many PvP encounters, go for it! Personally I can only level for an hour or two some nights, and gankers can easily erase that from you if they want to.
---
Most guilds will need to have a larger then 40 man raid group anyway since it's almost impossible to have the same 40 people turn up every time. So I think you will be good. But ofc guilds that can maintain the same 40 man in their group will have a big egde on the other guilds. So dont expect your guild to be top

---
Back when reviews focused on the game mechanics rather than forcing in some political narrative no one actually gives a shit about.
---
No one will maintain at low levels a second gear set for tanking, especially when they are running around with a 2h weapon anyway. Warriors that know what they are doing will go all in for leather agility gear.
---
They can tank it easily and dodge a lot because of the agility, leather is BiS for Warrior until raid because it's the best for their DPS &amp; still good for tanking.
---
Memorial Day
---
Well made video. RPPVP servers are the best.
---
Don’t wanna be top, just want to clear the content at some point, thanks for the reply that’s a good point I didn’t think of it like that
---
Making Asmon the alliance leader is probably an Old God scheme to destroy the world.
---
preist tier 2 8 piece adds a rank 5 renew on GH
---
Riding skill was the Classic system in 1.12.0. It changed in 1.12.1 in anticipation of The Burning Crusade.
---
It makes sense for Blizzard to exclude design choices from Classic the things that were implemented in the game solely for reasons involving an expansion pack.
---
It does not make sense for Blizzard to implement items into Classic that were removed from the game 7 months before the expansion was even announced and 21 months before it was released.
---
Every item in the game is in it's 1.12 state. Some of it is just locked behind time gates. The Unarmored Mounts were not available in 1.12. A design choice and an item in the game are not the same thing.
---
It's one of the worst skills hunters have but I enjoy things like that. One of the skills I missed the most was sentry totem. Not the best ability but it was sure fun to use.
---
sure, but its been like this for the last week
---
Fuck that make feral spec gib bear form +defense
---
Good point. I remember it as a gimmick because in my social circle people didn't know it and in my pvp encounters I saw it only very very rarely. Probably just luck.
---
Ya that part is just out of the ball park wrong. Maybe it was written in an early alpha when they had focus?
---
Turn on your in game music! 🤣
---
It says "sustained dps" so it's even more wrong hahahah
---
I don't know how it is currently on the beta but you shouldnt even be able to enter Uldaman at lvl 30.
---
what did i just read
---
Remember, sometimes 40 man raids are hard to roster consistently, you need a roster of 45-50 to have options even, So 70-75 is more than fine. Guilds generally will take what they can get, especially more casual ones
---
A lot of beta is just playing the game. It’s how you find bugs.
---
Pull up!  Pull up!
---
**crashes into Stormwind**
---
When does "we are open to it" Translate to 99% confirmed?
---
"people who hate loosing" thats why they have bubble hearthstone and lay on hands :D
---
You are pervert with big dick ;)
---
3.0 skeet volley.  Especially dwarves with guns
---
let’s just change the game name to WfW. World for Warcraft
---
Collector's edition wasn't available for purchase in 1.12 but they are allowing players to have those.
---
You do realize 1.12 is just for the foundation and not the actual content right? I get you want to be smart but youre not
---
DM is hard, requires 159 gearscore at least. Hilarious meme
---
Patch Notes won't be released for the Beta servers. They never have been.
---
Is this a goldshire quest
---
&gt;  ~~Proscriptivists~~ Prescriptivists still do not seem to have realised that dictionaries are almost exclusively descriptivist institutions. It is literally the funniest thing ever.
---
You know what, I agree with you 100%. Unfortunately, we can't alter psychology. Even the average player will use the information made available by min/maxers, such as ideal specs and rotations for nearly any situation. 
---
However, we CAN buff content to give the average player the best possible experience.
---
No. Mm/surv is the best pvp spec.
---
You wont be raiding 3-4 nights per week. You'll be raiding 4-5 hours per week. Classic raids aren't hard, they're probably on par with normal mode retail raids.
---
Blackhand doomsaw is a good bop blue 2h from p1
---
P2 brings Barberous Blade from DM: p2
---
P3 brings Ice Barbed Spear and unstoppable force 
---
Arcanite Reaper is craftable in p1.
---
Obsidian Edged Blade and Earthshaker are the pre rag 2h, with BRE and Spinal Reaper off rag in p1, then hand of rag in p3.
---
P3 adds the bwl weapons, I believe there is a mace (technically 2 but one has int on it), 2x axes, and 2x swords in there. P3 also adds R14 weps.
---
With p4 and 5 a bunch of catchup weapons get added in zg, silithus and aq20. Iirc none are better than unstoppable force (except zinrohk), but easier to get if hitting level cap in p4/5.
---
Many guildes have fixed raidtimes, like "every Wednesday and Saturday from XX to YY."
---
They also have rules about attendance, ranging from "be there or be kicked" to "join whenever you like".
---
I would suggest to just keep an eye on here or forums in the first few weeks to find your place.
---
You also have to last hit to get soul shards or whatever right?
---
Top comments in this thread confirmed clueless. 
---
Hunters are very strong for the vast majority of raids and don’t fall off until AQ40 and Naxx, and Hunters are always S tier in PvP
---
Many guilds wont a single TF, let alone a second. Your question is kinda invalid :)
---
lol?
---
I have a lot of your wallpapers on repeat on my computer for more than two weeks now, i didnt know you added new one. Cool, thanks. Your work is awsome.
---
Besides timegates and very few design choices (not really content), the game will be in its 1.12 state.
---
https://willitclassic.com/ has a list of current active classic beta addons. Good news! WeakAuras finally works on classic beta - a victory for everyone, quite frankly.
---
as long as you are paying the monthy sub of 15 dolla then yes. you don't need to buy BFA.
---
Sweet, thanks
---
If you can be flexible with race show her an Undead female, with the pretty face, in t2 Priest gear and a Benediction. Or any other Priest raid set. I feel like healer gear has always appealed to females more. 
---
Source: am a female and that made me want to play Horde when I first started. Though nowdays I lean towards female Troll Priest so I'd try that too. Also try T2 Hunter gear on an Orc. The colours are nice and the armour is amazing looking with their model.
---
I agree actually, Blizzard's reason for not doing unarmored mounts is that it's unnatural for players to KNOW a change like this is coming, whereas back in retail Vanilla no one knew that the mounts were soon to become extremely rare. But that applies to tons of other things in the game that players have advanced knowledge of, the AQ gate opening being one of them.
---
Dont need last hit, SD needs to be active while the mobs dies.
---
Sure it was. You just had to find an unclaimed copy from Ebay.
---
You say Semi-hardcore but you want a full raid max level and raid ready by the third week? That's like 10 hours a day. Nothing Semi-hardcore about that.
---
Alright. I was given a free month when reclaiming my old account, so I hope thats good
---
I wish I could, but I don't know anything about making wallpapers for phones. I can provide the source video files to anyone who can, though!
---
I dont play retail, cant help you mate.  
---
I set up ui in beta manually.
---
it is bad untill you get your whirlwind axe at which point it gets a whole lot easier and then around 51-52 (if you know where to get your 2-hand weapon from) is where you will suffer again at the start (once AV is out that is no longer an issue ether)
---
that is for solo questing leveling. however to play a warrior properly is to find anybody to group with with as often as you can since warrior are simply put the best class to group up with.
---
if your properly go by the motto of grouping up and tanking dungeons often level are warrior is not worse than other classes
---
I would go for a Aff/Demo build. Did that in vanilla with a friend, worked out great 👍🏻
---
Tanaris is one of my favorite questing zones (specifically killing the pirates and wastewander guys) but gadgetzan itself is just meh for a town imo. there really isnt much to it
---
Don't think I'm gonna use that many abilities that need shards while leveling, I think?
---
They move up from shit tier to Ok tier. 
---
You don’t get God Tier unless you’re geared + healer, and gearing takes much longer than the vast majority of warriors will ever get to
---
&gt;Maybe it was written in an early alpha when they had focus?
---
Pretty sure Hunters also did not have a talent tree at that point so it wouldnt make sense either.
---
Hi,
---
These are super awesome, thank you so much. How do I set these as my background?
---
Nothing, I'm glad it will work.
---
Is this on PS? May be different in classic
---
As I said assuming vanilla does good. 
---
If blizzard makes money from it they will obviously release a expansion they have already made to make a easy buck. Plus if the community wants it would put blizzard in a good light. 
---
Maybe 99% is a over exaggeration but if I had to put my money on it I would say it will come out roughly 2 years after classic. 
---
Would not be surprised if they start working on it few months after classic releases. They already have a team dedicated to classic and no real content to make (because all of it is already made).
---
I enjoy playing to win and with people who share that mindset, playing together for years now with our premades thanks m8.
---
If you want to lose play tauren.
---
Lmao look at this chad with several girlfriends.
---
Us REAL vanilla veterans never got to talk to girls.
---
Yeah, warrior fast using guides, 40 hour a week sets it to 1.4 months. I'll be damned if it takes me that long if I have anything to say about it.
---
it lacked content on alliance so i never ventured there much
---
One of the most ridiclious trinkets in the game, along with the Rogue one. Such a pain to get, you need a minimum of 4 weeks in ZG clearing the weekly bosses, and only 2-3 in the raid will get to make one.
---
&gt;And speccing arcane, when the only single target spell it had was missiles
---
That part is actually not wrong. 31 Arcane for AP will be higher DPS than full frost for MC and BWL. You need 1 mage in the raid to provide the Winter's Chill debuff. Otherwise all you gain from going down the frost tree will be survivability talents. All your DPS increasing talents are so early in the tree you will be able to get them all with 31 points in Arcane.
---
You will still use Frostbolt ofc. Arcane in Vanilla isnt a spec on its own. It's a support tree meant to augment the other two elements you use.
---
Can finally confirm, both moons are in Classic.
---
What? 5 mans are way better in classic. It's not even a competition.
---
What's funny? They might occasionally notify testers of big changes but they work on hundreds of bugs at once and are usually fixing 30+ on any given work day. Making massive patch notes is pointless during active development, all focus is on making the game. It's all tracked internally on a database of course but there's nothing to be gained from publishing daily patch notes.
---
*sigh* another one.
---
They are using 1.12 as a *base*. 
---
That means that whatever was in vanilla is open to be debated.
---
Is there ambient sound with it?  I can't check atm.  Haven't used wallpaper engine for a while, but I really want to sub to all of these and just let them go wild on 3 screens.
---
Impressive, but...  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/cKmP0Nv](https://imgur.com/a/cKmP0Nv)
---
I almost made a post like this last night but figured it wouldnt be taken very well by the community. The beta was super exciting during the leveling period, kept me wanting more during the gearing process, had me on the edge of my seat during the dungeon push (SM Armory / SM Cath), I enjoyed watching WSG for a day or two. Now we are here, the things to do are starting to dwindle and the hype is dying down. This was inevitable but I can't help but think, what are they going to do for the next 90 days before launch. Will they raise the level cap? How far will they let these streamers go? I would hope they plan for something big right at the end of the Beta to build the hype back up, I fear that the hype will never be as high as it was the first weekend of the Beta.
---
Alliance will mostly avoid it since it’s packed with horde
---
i love how races were logical for class choices, but it still never made sense why human hunters took so long to get. I mean... to me thats the most logical next to anything warrior based
---
Hi, /u/DMorVC
---
Phase 1 MC hunters can top
---
DM or VC?
---
was it supposed to come out on playstation originally?
---
Can you explain the scenario you want tested to me?  I'm not familiar with it. I'm in the beta though and have alchemy high enough to make shadow oil, I can probably find a lock to help me out
---
So what content can you name that won't be in it's 1.12 state?
---
Probably in the minority but i would love to see achievements added. I remember them being really motivating for me to explore ignored content in WotLK.
---
Yeah we will see. For sure back in the day Dwarf priests were not that common. There were recruitment posts for "Dwarf priest only" for some of the hardcore guilds, and we will see the same thing again.
---
I got char of all the NE classes to lvl 60 by the end of vanilla, and I would make a dwarf priest for classic (and probably will, but start with warrior).
---
Anyway I hope you are right and it is so casual that it is not 90% of priests are dwarves. I would be suprised if any of the hardcore guilds accepted a preist of anything else, but maybe I am misremembering how much fear there was. Onyxia for sure it helped a lot to have a fear ward on the MT. But maybe 1 is enough. A spare for some healers would be useful as well thoguh.
---
Anyway hope you are right, and it is more casual. Been looking at all the human racial discussion, but for warriors NE is ok I think.
---
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
---
Wow  I didn't even think about this. Having PVP without AB sucks, it's by far the best battleground in Vanilla.
---
Not for me. No bars show up.
---
You can clear every bit of content up to AQ40 with a pug. AQ40 and Naxx is where you will want to be in a top tier guild and have 100% raid attendance. If you are ok with not clearing those two raids, then you should be 100% fine
---
As a NE rogue, it was an amazing place to gank horde.
---
Too slow, even a convoluted keybinding would be faster. Voice attack is good for games like Elite: Dangerous and flight sims where you may have too many keybindings to be bound to a joystick / pedal setup.
---
Everyone keeps saying Warriors have it the worst, but I'd have to give this one to Rogues.
---
What a noob using the arrow keys. Bad dog.
---
Hahaha maybe it was their goal and they just messed up big time.
---
Without /sit in vanilla this isn’t the case. All the theorycrafting you’ve read came from pservers where /sit worked
---
Good post yes unstoppable force is what I had, I remember now.
---
This has been the speed run meta since 2005.
---
I'm worried people are going to abuse Layering to farm Herbs, Arena Grandmaster trinkets and Devilsaur Leather much faster than they should be able to. If the system is tuned well enough to be hard to exploit, then it's incredible.
---
Instead of Layering, I'm fine with servers that get merged more aggressively when pop drops months down the line, and I'm fine with higher server queues. The concept of accepting a group or guild invite and seeing Orgrimmar vanish and get replaced with totally different group of people is something I never want to see.
---
I'm betting on a level cap raise soon, since alpha players are at ~50? cap, cause of the one 48.
---
Chillax, dev teams need weekends too. We had a stress test and they enabled wsg last weekend. They're having another stress test in 2 days. I think there's a good chance they raise the level cap to 40 in the next couple of weeks.
---
Disappointed with the pvp blue set. Rank 10 isn't exactly free and will be garbage by the time it's available
---
You expect multiple updates and patches faster than a week? It’s been a week, the weekly reset hasn’t even happen. The server maintenance hasn’t happen.
---
enhancement, even with unnerfed windfury, is anything but OP.
---
Yeah, I don't get where people think Classic raiding is going to be like Vanilla raiding.
---
All the raid content available in Classic launch can be cleared in under an hour.
---
&gt; Your delusional. You honestly think a random private server launch is on the same scale as this? There’s gonna be a 1/4 million people playing this at launch. You rly think blizz is rolling out 100 servers?
---
Yes, there will be way more people, but it'll also be multiple servers instead of just one. My guess is about 30 servers in EU, and about 50 in NA (counting BR, Latin and Oceaninc servers) so yeah, close to 100
---
&gt; I’m willing to bet the server techs that work at blizzard/activison have a lot of experience with this then a random no name redditor. Seriously, who are you, what market research, analytics, data have you collected to make a statement like “Layering is no needed”
---
I'm a random just like you and we have different oppinions on the matter. It doesn't make you right about it.
---
No worrires m8 come again on classic. We will w8 u with open arms.
---
This. 1-2 nights is the most it will take. A lot of people I know will be raiding classic as their side game. Not enough things to do to simply play it at all times.
---
The best scenario oddly enough might be for you to get in a duel with someone. Ideally you're a healer so you can heal their damage. Make sure the Warlock has the Improved Shadow Bolt talent. Also have them enchant Shadow Oil to a weapon. Have him cast R1 Shadowbolts until the debuff is applied to you.  
---
After that, have the Warlock then melee you until they receive a Shadow Bolt proc from Shadow Oil. You may have to repeat this process until the Warlock can receive a SO proc in the time before ISB falls off.  
---
When you're able to produce the result note if 1 of the 4 charges is removed upon the SO proc and if it received the 20% damage boost.
---
Oh how the World has changed.
---
Hi, /u/Sassy_Camel
---
Going to go out on a limb and that that the guy you are replying to is just having fun with it as well
---
x1000 that was me
---
They require Wallpaper Engine, which has to be purchased. Thankfully it's rather cheap (\~$4 USD or regional equivalent), and all wallpapers are free. I haven't gone back to normal wallpapers since.
---
60 by December on a Hunter?! That can't be true. I sure hope it isn't true. ;-;
---
Low lvl enchanting mats were at their highest on fresh private servers to the point where you could make 2-3times the money selling DE's instead of vendoring. It was like that for a certain private server at Least. Might not be bad to lvl it up in the beginning,and if he's making a caster then the wands are nice.

shouldve had a max level dungeon/raid in stonetalon peak.  orc 7 is one of my favorite wc3 levels and it was a shame that the caverns didnt/havent made an appearance in wow
---
Well if he would've kept the flag on him, pop evasion or something, some team mate might be able to help him?
---
Lots of pvp here when I played in the day
---
not to mention this is a fresh launch where the first few levels (or more if you don't get ahead) will be incredibly contested
---
Swear I had the exact same person in my raids
---
Buffing all pve content in classic. I know it is a change but it used to be decently hard because everyone fucking sucked. In some ways it would feel more authentic to buff it all.
---
Well, this is the way vanilla was, and we loved it even with its flaws.
---
What other people said here is true: Retail is the option for someone that wants to play "what they want". Older games weren't as inclusive and this have both its pros and cons.
---
The good thing is that everyone will be able to enjoy both types of games with just one subscription.
---
Honestly, if you are telling your friends "play what you want and everything will be fine", then that's on you. You are lying to them and you seem to know it.

The average speed to 60 is between 10-12 days **played time.** So yeah, at 20 hours per week - you're looking at 12-14 weeks to hit 60.
---
It's not the end of the world. It's just boring because you don't really have any buttons to push until (i think) level 36 (whirlwind - then MS at 40). I guess I get improved overpower early just so that I can occasionally feel like I'm doing something.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if &gt;60% quit before hitting the level cap. It's probably higher than that, even -- I have dozens of characters but only hit the level cap on a handful of them (i.e. my own rate is &lt;40%, and I managed to cap the warrior).
---
I am very chill. I wonder how the testers would feel if they wiped the servers and kept the cap at 30. Would people just not level again or would they level different classes? Alternatively, they could lock the current "layer" and force people to start over again on a new "layer", when they do raise cap, merge the two "layers". 
---
There is still plenty of things they can do but looking out over the next 70-90 days, what are their plans to keep hype up, or at least raise the hype again at the end. Will be interesting to see
---
servers are designed for 2500~ players without radical changes to respawn and density rates. those private gigaservers are the most unvanilla thing ever
---
Mage doesn't even mention frost... They definitely need an update of this book.
---
Also Azeroth (small text next to STV) doesn't really make sense
---
The game is already changed. Stop posting this idiotic platitude.
---
Alpha as in internal testing? How do we know what level the Alpha testers are?
---
No attendance is the easiest way to get kicked out of a guild
---
You really only need one day
---
Maybe two
---
if you have no consistency in your schedule at all, like there are no safe days during the week like sunday or whatever. 
---
Then raiding will be very difficult for you. If you make it long enough without having to miss in the beginning, they may be tolerant. You start off missing raids. Say goodbye to loot and probably your raid spot unless you're vastly better than the alternatives they have
---
Always good to have a whole seperate bag for your shards. You always gonna make healthstones and soulstones. And if you gonna run some instances now and then and want to provide for your group you're gonna need some.
---
Probably but also bare in mind that those players will most likely end up pulling too many mobs and dying. So unless they quit they will become more patient and careful... and since they have never played vanilla before (or for a long time) they wont know where the quests are and whats the most optimal way to level up.
---
And id say its a given that majority of players wont play 20 hours a day to speed level or anything like that. :P
---
They might aim to level up quick but they wont be doing it at the expense of their daily lives or routine.
---
You're saying raiders in blue/mc gear will easily clear MC and Ony in under an hour of game time on Classic servers? Good luck with that buddy.
---
If you want/is able to, you can send it to me in a pm. I've snowed in on this and I'm gonna personally see this through, even though I don't know shit about this. How hard can it be? 😂
---
I never even touched WoW post cata, the game was dead pvp wise once s9 hit since the game was normalized.
---
Holypalas spend more time buffing and cleansing than healing, your globals are all used up. And no, a hpala won't be oom in 30seconds lol.
---
Vindication is not a good talent in a premade setting because it's a debuff slot at best, a team sending a ret up against warriors etc is asking to be blown up since there is an ele resto support nearby who can global you regardless, or any frontline for that matter. Eye for an eye does little there because the game is not about braindead zerg at a top level.
---
Regardless you gave yourself away as someone with no experience at all in vanilla pvp (there is a well known server where people premade, try to get in there as a "ret" and see what happens for confirmation) because there is at best ONE rogue in a premade on flag guarding/FC support duty. Rogues cc all day, never really aim to kill (except key target with a team with cold blood and all, you die in a stun there tho) so vindication is useless. Warriors are spam dispelled (horde runs 3 priests for a reason) and own any paladin in a melee fight even attempting to play with no mortal strike vs that is just ridiculous. You're FORCED to sit back, which is exactly why ret is useless.
---
You run things like sl lock, ele mage with hpalas in setups, your cc is a hinderance due to lack of range (in relation to position as ret if defensive) and those classes can do the same but better (does not break on damage, no real cd, consistency). DR is not really an issue in classic, only if you plan to multi poly etc to stall someone. 
---
I already explained by sac does not work for ret, the biggest strenght of hpal is being immortal whilst impossible to cc (sit at 15-30y range behind frontline means barely anything can breach through to even touch them, any long range instant cc breaks on damage from sac so cleanse and heal spam is guaranteed, the only danger is a counterspell) at range, being 10yard or closer (ret) just means you get fucked up. No one really needs to cc you at close range, you will get feared (does not break on sac all the time) or straight up nuked down to hell by mages and shamans. 
---
If you pick up the build you suggested you miss out on more healing power, crit, DIVINE FAVOR (on demand burst heal or damage is huge in vanilla) and the general tankiness of the prot tree, you also have less judgement dmg or pushback resistance (either or).
---
The benefits of the ret tree are less mana cost on judges and cd (woohoo, you stay out of range for that to matter and have more than enough mana anyway), more might (warrior bshout or hunter aura, redundant and worse than kings) movement speed (enchant covers that), eye for an eye (pointless since the classes that would bother to kill you can do so (shatter combo, ele sham) and if they are attacking you safely your team already failed (or just use a grenade and all is well) damage related talents (useless) repentance (meh).
---
You lose out on a TON just for a cc when cc is abundant (you don't need 5000 cc's to win if you can use them properly) and what comes in the damage department is absolutely laughable, just run another arms warrior in gear.
---
Instead of spreading misinformation and giving people false hopes that this garbage spec works try playing against actual top premades with your meme spec and see for yourself why it is useless.
---
What's even funnier is the best in slot tank belt for druids have.... 1% Parry.
---
Oh no I agree with you. But I'd still drastically prefer that to layering.
---
Most of these are just throttles that slow players down, not make the content more difficult.
---
The whole idea of classic is that you meet up if you need an item to be accessible instantly, instead of walking to a cross-city storage to exchange items with guildies.
---
Some wallpapers are silent, some have music, some have ambient sound effects. I wasn't confident in messing with sound and music until after I experimented a little and the ones with sound proved popular. This entire wallpaper-making hobby has been quite the learning process!
---
I'm just thankful that wallpaper engine is customizable enough that we can change the volume or mute them as we wish.
---
No. When released from their time gate, they will be in their 1.12 state.
---
An argument that some 1.12 content won't be available at launch is not an argument that some NOT-1.12 content should be available at launch.
---
I really miss his more chill Diablo 3 days, from many years ago. He's always been spastic and kind of annoying, but it was more balanced by a chill chat and some fun Diablo pushes, tips and stuff... Now the chat is all memes and Pepe's and Quinn has sort of embraced that for better or worse. It's just a spergfest, to use one of his words. I can't stand it for too long personally, but I'm glad he's still successful.
---
Spirit tap and drain soul will be unnecessary in duo imo. I'm doing the same duo. Pain and wand and warlock does two dots with void. Mobs will melt. Life tap + renew. Anyone disagree?
---
300 on a whole continent/world? thats a VERY unreasoned guess.. they already said 3k but its dynamically scaling, but i doubt it would ever go under 2k.
---
thats why we dont think the exploits wil be that hard, there arent many layers to begin with. omar gonzalez also mentioned layers possibly being whole continents instead of worlds. like that u only have 2 versions of kalimdor if u got 4 layers, where 12k people could play on.
---
Yes, i understand that. That is literally not the argument i was using. I agree that was the spirit, by that logic loot trading shouldnt have been added either in order to free up Customer service. issues are issues regardless of the spirit of wow
---
It was on! It was one of those rare moments in between music not playing and music playing.
---
&gt;You can play any class even in end game.
---
that's more a sign of endgame being dead easy instead of the game being balanced
---
That is a zone that was turned to trash in Cata, like loch Modan. 
---
Take me back!
---
You really ought to play vs good premades and see why it does not work.
---
Do you know that horde teams run 3 priests and alliance has 1-3 priests and 1-2 palas? What do you think is your dot going to do? (also, shadow resistance aura gg wp).
---
I'm not gonna bother with numbers with someone who has no experience in top tier premades, SWP in good gear (r14,BWL,AQ20) will tick 280-300damage. That is not enough, it's bad for premades where kills happen more quickly. Also spreading dots all over the place is a way to get kicked, it ruins a lot of CC. No point to spread damage like trash tier 1.5k players do in solo battlegrounds to top damage meters when you are unable to cc people and get focused kills. Mind blast deals about as much damage as an elemental mages instant (and they have plenty) so that's also redundant (plus it has to cast).
---
Also yes, wotlk dots tick for about 50% if left undispelled in s8. Naturally you use absorbs dispels etc to cover it.
---
Yes, that is exactly what will happen.
---
How about you actually enjoy the game, instead of rushing to level 60?
---
True men play Warriors...and true men don't quit.
---
This guy has sports in his chart so he's miles ahead of some of us.
---
who is talking about 3 layers? :3
---
As far as I'm aware, there isn't an easy way to do it. You'll have to click on an author's name and view their workshop through Steam. It's not ideal, but that way you can see just their submissions.
---
Assuming you'll gear up fast in raids yes.
---
Realistically, it'll be way easier to get rank10 gear and MC/Ony gear.
---
If specs were all perfectly balanced, there would be nothing interesting or unique like Ret and Moonkin are in 1.12. I'm fine with this kind of balance, where a low tier specialist can put in the extra time and effort to actually make their character perform pretty well and stand out from the horde of undead mages and rogues.
---
hunter trinket is garbage compared to the rogue or druid one. While certainly not the worst of them all, you need to remember that multi-shot is NOT instant. So you cant set up burst like a rogue can, charm, into vanish, into thistle tea.

0 Reason to go human anything in classic unless you 100% PvE only.

Were they able to complete the SM quests and get the vanquisher sword?!
---
Why most underrated? I never saw anyone bashing this zone.
---
Thanks for explaining to us was OP means op
---
Thats no moon.
---
You are missing my point.
---
Warriors won't even take Mace Spec over Axe Spec (1% Crit vs 1% Stun for 3s).
---
The SoJ stun is shorter and costs the paladin upwards of 1/3 to 1/2 of his damage to use.
---
&gt;playing a shit spec.
---
Paladins in general should fuck up rogues tho. I mean, you watched the same video I did. Even after a huge chain of dodge and resists he still almost died.
---
fuck cats
---
MC was popular through the entirety of classic. Casuals who took their time to get to 60, latecomers, alts and rerollers can all make great use of the ZG amulet "out of order" :)
---
By the time OP hits level 60, the guilds will be in BWL and have MC on farm. So where it's relevant, yes.
---
A couple speedrunner guilds have already tested this on Pservers. Given pre-BIS, they run Ony, grab the buff, and hit MC. It takes them less than an hour.
---
I absolutely love how you were just plain wrong in the first place and are calling everyone out for correcting you. You're the reason why digging through negative comments is worth it &lt;3
---
Yeah very true
---
I also have only limited time, but I would like a really full server where you can meet people everywhere...
---
Maybe I will simply base my choice on my friends. :)
---
Exactly why you don't twist with it...
---
Loud = funny                    
---
     /s
---
they will go online as they were back then (1.12)  
---
I guess this makes hand of justice BiS for nearly the entire classic journey for most melees? :3
---
Ok then. Let's not hit the stun button at all because it has a 30% chance to resist.
---
A+
---
10/10
---
wow was easy on private servers too. i got to 60 twice and we barely wiped in dungeons (deadmines is always the hardest because everyone has white gear), aside from that quests are easy, elite quests were definitely not soloable which is correct. regarding the raids, do i need to say MC/BWL/AQ got cleared the first day or two of release.
---
I only got in the stress beta, but I was able to test the same class of actions using other abilities.
---
Do you still need to go to the instance? Or is that a bit too far back in classic?
---
If you remember what build you had, could you link it? =)
---
Those mounts remain unchanged as items in 1.12 as well. There is no reason why you can’t argue that those mounts can’t be time gated as well.
---
I'd imagine you'd just go full affliction. Most people are saying imp vw isn't worth it for soloing on Classic, and in a duo it definitely won't - taking damage isn't an issue and faster kill rate means the vw will just be constantly oom. So you can just go full normal affliction build with improved imp - instant corruption, suppression, life tap, nightfall, SM etc.  
---
Idea would just be to immolate/corruption/agony/(siphon life) every mob you're in range of and let your priest sw:p each as well, that should be enough to kill any mob. You probably will get the occasional killing blow but the priest should get the majority so they'll be fine and will have plenty of mana to heal you through life taps.
---
Hi, /u/itzpiiz
---
20/20/20 with one point to spare.
---
I'd level again as a different class and clear different starting quests and zones I didnt do the first time.
---
As someone who would do solo lava runs, your times are off I suspect.
---
True heroes
---
Dont listen to these guys.
---
Take skinning and enchanting but dont level enchanting past the greater magic wand.
---
You get two farming skills that dont reauire nodes plus the enchabting mats sell really well.
---
On 60 drop it for whatever else you like.
---
Also making wands early makes good money as every caster wants them.
---
&gt;Exactly why you don't twist with it...
---
Changing the subject are we? ;)
---
Comment for bookmark
---
This, most tanks and healers in low level dungeons will be in dps spec.
---
Only if the paladin plays reckoning spec, which he did not.
---
A pala with no reckoning (or some sort of protpala with dmg reflect shit to farm PvE) has no chance vs a rogue. Rogue just resets endlessly and wears pala mana down.
---
I mean... it depends. I don't think we will have any shortage of warriors for raiding, dungeons, PvP and endgame in general or anything like that, but going off the polls that have been done of redditors specifically, it seems like warrior is the most popular class. This means the most people will presumably be playing warrior and when most people quit (which they would do so regardless of the class they play) a lot of warriors will be gone. So in a way, even if people don't quit because of warrior specifically, a lot of warriors will end up quitting.
---
Now this is cool!
---
Bro I'm in the same boat, work 4 10s and can work and 4 days of the week, either day or night. My plan is to just let my guild leader know what is going on and hopefully work something out.
---
&gt;As someone who would do solo lava runs, your times are off I suspect.
---
If you did solo lavaruns you obviously did it in a different expansion.
---
I trust my 245 lava runs on a private server run over some later expansion solo run.
---
More DOTS!
---
Yeah, I think they're going to add Guild Banks, they just don't want to ruin the marketing momentum of "we're listening to you, #nochanges" by announcing it now. Once everyone is hooked, they'll slip it in as a necessity.
---
pls dont forget all the low pop servers after 2 months which they have to somehow merge :3
---
If you wanna completely wreck everything in pvp and be useful in offtanking in raids during specific fights, then you should be a a fury warrior.

If you want Classic exactly like Vanilla, then why do you want new content added? This sub seems to be largely in favor of OSRS style adding new content. That means adding new gear, which will inevitably be better than Naxx gear. Same way that if they added a new 5 man it probably serves better gear than what currently exists. Which in turn changes the meta.
---
If people want no changes, fine, but then the no changes crowd cant say you want new content in the "vanilla style" because new gear changes the meta.
---
I told him the truth. That he should ultimately play what he thinks would be fun, but that there are specs that are much weaker and will not be as valuable.
---
It feels dumb to have to tell him "Well, even though its not your ideal, maybe consider rolling Mage instead of Feral."
---
Fine, if you have the mount in Classic you can keep it. But the vendor that sells them will be in their 1.12 state, so good luck.
---
With recklessness like that, you could get into the stock market!
---
BUT THEN THIS HAPPENS.
---
Thanks. I'm not following him on twitch. I do find that guy a bit hard to watch bet it a great preparation vs not comparison.
---
Not really. Private servers were just as easy as classic. do i need to say all raid tiers got cleared on the first or two days of release, I still remember people cleared MC with level 58s. lveled to 60s on the popular vanilla p.servers and it's nothing out of the ordinary as some make it out to be, it's a cakewalk, you just need to invest a lot of time.
---
Part of me wishes they had made Arcane Hunter a viable spec.

---
From another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs6mxw/gather_around_vanilla_newbies_let_me_warn_you/):
---
PvP leveling guilds were a huge, huge part of Vanilla, with guilds staying in each bracket for weeks at a time, hanging out on Vent with no set schedule allowing slower players to keep up with faster ones, getting to know all the PvPers on both factions of the server, running BGs in AH greens simply for the fun of playing with your friends, competing against your rivals, and perhaps getting a new title after moving up bracket...
---
And then, while in the 50s, one of your more hardcore members whose been at rank 10 for a while gets antsy and "accidentally" dings 60 by killing NPCs in AV... and life suddenly changes in ways nobody could have imagined just a few happy-go-lucky weeks ago...
---
I did it in classic as the Guild BS to make dark iron gear at the forge as a healer, solo.
---
Get gud.

How so? I didn't say you can play every spec and finish the raid with 40 druids. I said that you can find a spot in a end game guild even if you're not playing the best class possible.
---
You would need to put in more effort but it's doable.
---
Yeah and Blizz specifically noted it as not a bug that it wasnt working on the beta

Rank 1 SoC does the same damage on-hit as Rank 5, only the base damage of the Judgement is affected. SoR is much more affected by downranking, but it might still be worth it at either min or max rank of SoR. Keep in mind that the bar for it being worth the mana isn't exactly high, as the current mana sink for Ret is increasing the rank of Consecration you're using. Which is really, really inefficient.
---
Im not changing shit.
---
Did I say you used JoJ in Pvp?  No  
---
Did I say JoJ slowed people in pvp? No  
---
Did I say SoJ was used in pvp? No  
---
Fuck off baddie.
---
That's fucking awesome.
---
Raid Content will be easier compared to vanilla, and the average player is just better by now,some even did the bosses back then.
---
But some People seem to not remember a very hard part in vanilla was getting 40 good geared people together at a time (better 2-4 times a week). So u wont just run over content in classic as some People in this Thread think.
---
As a warrior,even as not the mt,you should have one of the highest attendance in your raid imo.
---
Cause u will need some good weapons which share with other warris/rogues.
---
So if u take them and are not there the next 2-3 Progression raids its a huge disadvantage for ur guild. On Top of that as dps warri u want to keep collecting tank gear (after the Tanks) for later bosses.
---
I was Mage back in vanilla and i can tell you it was super tilting everytime our MT wasnt there.
---
So please pick another class if u dont want to harm your raid and want to clear all raids with a lower attendance.
---
This was fucking fantastic.
---
Swiftly
---
"This item has an increased chance to be resisted on targets over Level 60" was one of my most hated additions to TBC. That was  anti-fun Blizzard in full swing. I still rock my Tidal Charm in TBC and feel amazing when I get a stun every 2 out of 10 tries.
---
No setup is complete without a few bottles of Laphroaig!
---
I would legitimately swap to horde if Asmon ruled a RPPVP server. Like I’d have legitimate purpose then
---
I doubt this, speaking as a vanilla player. We got by just fine. As with most things in vanilla, hardly practical, but an emphasis on simplicity and organic human interactions with each other.
---
I don't know dude. You should at least have mail armor at level 18 which used to be minimum tank level for a comfortable run in DM imo.
---
This really isnt rp though..
---
Yessss! Recently got into whisky and this shit is the best
---
17 September or 7 September with Super Fast which is crazy. The difference between a Joana and a decent player is not 10 Days of Levelspeed. I expect to take around 5-6 Days of Playtime. I will do some Dungeons because they are fun and will lose some Time because I play on a PvP Server, but it will never amount to more than 1-2 Days played more overall. 
---
But I'm not sure about 70hrs a Week. 10hrs a Day for the first Week seems reasonable.
---
&gt; If you want Classic exactly like Vanilla, then why do you want new content added?
---
I don't.... the only thing I want are TBC servers after some time. Wich isn't exactly new vanilla content.
---
While I don't oppose the OSRS method, I think it won't be healthy in the short term, i.e. let's wait at least a couple years and various guilds cleaning naxx before implementing it. Then maybe yeah, we can even get some rebalancing, but they have to be careful to not turn classes into the boring counterparts of BfA where everyone is equal (and maybe it's the only way to effectivelly balance things).
---
&gt; It feels dumb to have to tell him "Well, even though its not your ideal, maybe consider rolling Mage instead of Feral."
---
Again, it's the nature of the game. If someone told me they want to play street fighter 3 third strike I wouldn't say they can play with anyone and still win tournaments. Tier lists do exist and should be used if you want to be competitive.
---
As an predominantly alliance toon, there was nothing there- except as my rogue.
---
Yeah, I totally agree. I think Undead Hunter would have been a nice addition as well, with Sylvanas and Nathanos already being in Classic WoW.
---
Contacted the original author to see if he has plans or anything if i dont hear back ill put it up \^\^!

Hope that works, note: Its been 13 years so this is prob. not a good build but I liked it.
---
It's 60 energy for the rogue trinket. I got it recently, and is very powerful. I only use it for pvp though.
---
Please do not decline a job for wow..
---
there was a clip a few days ago from a stream where there was cross realm for some reason and a person on beta saw a 48 pally (with alpha server tag) running by on a mount
---
There is no reason to go Protection for leveling. You can tank all dungeons fine in a normal leveling spec.
---
&gt; Part of me wishes they had made ~~Arcane~~ Hunter ~~a~~ viable ~~spec~~.
---
Totally agree with that statement.
---
All jokes aside, hunters are great utility in a raid and pvp, but for a class that cannot fill other roles than dps, they sure lack in that department later on in the game.
---
If only arcane shot wasnt completely useless except for rank 1 for kiting. It scales of spell power insted of ranged AP making it virtually worthless
---
Noteworthy that privates are harder to make content not as easy.
---
Is he? My bad, I'm having a bit of trouble making sense of it tbh. As far as I know using different ranks of windfury was just a thing in TBC because there was no ICD before then.
---
Why am I laughing so hard. You deserve this upvote sir
---
So is pre-raid leather better than plate?
---
Caffeine injection via consumption of coffee: coffeine.
---
Well at least that means I’ve got one less fucking macro to use as a warrior lol.
---
This was great. But I don't see how a video that was made on a non-RPPVP server as a good argument for the need for RPPVP servers.
---
It's 60 energy for Renatakis Charm of Trickery. It took me almost 3 months of doing ZG every week. You'll also have to convince your guild to take you to the out of the way area to do it. There's no reason to clear it other than the trinkets. It's really powerful in PvP though still.
---
You can raid as feral
---
That sounds like a really fun guild. Wish BGs were in the game at launch so that this could be possible early on. By the time WSG is released people will be established enough that the 10-19 and 20-29 brackets will be overrun with twinks. The higher brackets would still be great fun though.
---
Like progressive content? Changes within vanilla are still true to the concept, and there are far more non-vanilla things they've already added.
---
How about you stop assuming what's best for people?
---
There is no personal loot in vanilla so the gear the drops is the gear that drops. 
---
With that being said, if you are raiding, make sure you ask your raid lead if it is okay for you to roll on offspec gear.
---
If you are running a dungeon, just ask your group! 
---
Easy as that.
---
Anecdotal evidence of "got by just fine" by violating the Terms of Service is not going to stop Blizzard from seeing the big picture.
---
Called it garbage is really stretching it. It's basically like hitting with a 2hander from a distance 6 times over 6 seconds + 1,500 damage.
---
He and that guy McConnell are unbearable. Why the fuck they are both ret paladins makes no sense.
---
Once ZG is out your day looks like this:
---
Split your raid in 2 20man groups, clear ony and grab the buff (if possible).
---
Those 2 20man raids then clear molten core (20-25man able depends on your gear and all, may skip this this is what you do to minmax, 2chances for thunderfury and a few good items etc, also enchant mats) so you get double the drops.
---
Then you clear ZG or BWL (ZG probably get a few people you can trust in to fill slots since you split the raid to 2 25mans) and BWL is cleared afterwards.
---
Ony takes like 20-30min, MC takes around 40-60min as 40man (with split raid but good gear like an hour to 5min), BWL is max an hour and ZG is also 40-60min.
---
That's all doable within one day, or 2days of 1-2hours of raiding. Attendance of 100% is easily achieved.
---
One of the biggest reasons I can't wait to get off these cesspool quarantine servers. I've never played on one that didn't have legit neo nazis spamming the undermoderated world chat at 2am. It gets old.
---
no
---
No just that you have to expect it to resist vs an orc.  Sure it might be 30% but any alliance will tell you it feels more like 50%
---
A warrior to 60 in retail vs classic isn’t comparable
---
and Paladins lost their only real interactive combat button in X to sit lul
---
I’d love the raw videos for these so I can create some things. :)
---
I'll try to find a lock to help me test this when I get home from work tonight
---
How else would he backpedle?
---
Balance is a joke even in the eyes of developers
---
IIRC there is an option to make it loop?
---
I started playing right around the end of AQ. I hit 60 grinding Naxx invasion mobs in winterspring. When I was mid 50s in EPL a level 59 helped me get through a quest and after talking to him he told me he had been leveling since release
---
I was saved by a "dressing room" thingy. looks like its female troll shammy. She did laugh her ass off reading your comment tho.
---
Rogues do it differently, while warriors kite to trade hits 1 to 1 with the mobs, rogue can kite to fill their energy bar to get some more burst. When done perfectly warriors don't lose dps, while rogues are going to lose a ton of auto attack damage, but it can be beneficial when killing elites or other difficult mobs.
---
Your shot of getting in as feral isn’t as bad as balance. If you put in time and effort to get a Druid with good professions for the guild (herb/alch and fishing/cooking) show up to all the raids with consumables to share and learn how to get the most dps out of a feral druid I don’t think you’ll find it hard to get a spot with a decent raiding guild to raid feral all the time, they’ll look past your mediocre damage output because of the versatility and consumables you bring!
---
Typically as your guild progresses, people will get all their mainspec gear and once nobody needs a piece of fear for offspec then you can start rolling for offspec and it really doesn't take that long to happen once people are clearing BWL.
---

---
# no changes.  Blasphemy
---
In a good guild they would give you feral gear.
---
Just at a lower prio, in the same way holy paladins can get ret gear. 
---
But if there is a warrior or rogue who wants what you want for PvP. They're probably gonna get that in a good guild.
---
No one is going to give their shitty non meta feral druid who brings nothing toa  fight good pvp items if a rogue or warrior wants them.
---
Also udders, don't forget udders.
---
Interesting.
---
Any tank that doesn't have a proper shield by the time they get to DM shouldn't be a tank. They had like 55 levels to figure it out.
---
Actually top tier meme. Well done.
---
Save yourself a whole lot of “can you please tank?” and roll a rogue to get better DPS and more satisfying PvP in addition to PVE.
---
Feral is typically used a lot more in raids than pvp.   
---
      
---
It's not rare at all that you'd be the only person in the raid that wants feral or balance gear. So yeah if you raid regularly it's not an issue at all. Get a guild that weekly clears AQ40 and you'll have all the gear you need before you know it.
---
Good lord how twinked are they!
---
I’ve never noticed the water cooler jugs before. Nice addition!
---
You just need the basic slots. Chest, pants, and shield for the most armor at that level
---
me and my buddy did this duo from 1 to 30 recently on a pserver and had a lot of success. just go deep affliction and get suppression. the synergy with this duo is amazing.
---
Look up Frostadamus on YouTube. He has videos on grinding spots and rare items worth a lot of gold.
---
Wait till all other raiders have their primary spec gear.
---
Also “At all levels of player characters and enemies, aggro radius is set to the intended distance.”
---
I wonder how many of those reports came from first timers to Moonbrook in Westfall.
---
I think your dog has a drinking problem 😂
---
I got Ironfoe back in the day and used the one comic addon with all the flashy Numbers popping up (can‘t remember the name). When I got the second hit my pc crashed because it couldn‘t handle the animations. So I got rid of the weapon because I liked the addon that much. I was a little bit stupid back in the day
---
I mean..im sure you were just really inexperienced at playing the game? Theres no way to really say you played 1800 hours “seriously” and only got to 50. You probably had other goals while leveing
---
If you need to tank you can good tanking pieces for dungs. If if you have leather, you still get good mail shield one handed, etc. So you can run dungeons and not a total waste.
---
There's no way they can fix EVERYTHING before launch. There's going to be inconsistencies that last months into Classic's launch. Some small ones will probably never be fixed. The amount of BFA code they have to mess with to fix tiny behaviors in Classic seems crazy.
---
OUCH!
---
You sound like the guy that can't get a girl under 300lbs.
---
Gatoraaaaade.  H2O! Gatoraaaaaade. H2O!!!!!! Water sucks, it really really sucks. REEEEEEE
---
Nah this was one of, if not the best revamped zones in cata. Don’t get me wrong I love old school Stonetalon for its aesthetic and sun rock retreat but a cohesive zone it is not. It’s basically a bunch of subzones with very different enemies from each other, which is great for vanilla standards. But the revamp adds a great story and giant set pieces along with a bunch of good references thrown in. It’s my favorite cata zone by far
---
Fucking cringe
---
Most likely not unless it is just farm content that your mains have got what they want. Any progression group isn't going to give you off-role gear (for pvp no less) instead of giving it to the rogues or other dps who it is an upgrade for.
---
I had no idea what i was doing
---
Dislike at me? Do you even English?
---
You miss just as much with 2h as you do a 1h main hand weapon, you just attack more often with 1h weapons. The offhand has an absurd miss chance. So high it’s not realistic to get it down to 0%.
---

As someone has already said, the Polearm off Rend is good.  
---
Bonecrusher is meh, it's fast speed.  
---
Destiny is meh, very fast speed.

Chillpike is super fast.

I could go on but the bottom line is, your realistic options pre phase is the Polearm from Rend, or Arcanite Reaper.

&lt;Hellion&gt; [EU][H][PVP] Hardcore light!
---
Hello!
---
Hellion is a new ''hardcore light'' guild forming for classic WoW, with veteran leadership and experience up to the four horsemen in Naxxramas. 
---
It's a guild for those of us that want to clear all content at a steady pace, but in a sensible and time efficient way. 
---
Rather than brute forcing progression by raiding insane amount of hours most days a week, we will be raiding a maximum of 3 days a week, 3 hours per raid. We realize that people have lives outside of WoW. 
---
With such limited raiding time, we require our raiders to be of high standard and prepare for the raids both in terms of consumables, enchants and strategy. The goal is to form a tight roster of highly skilled and like minded players.
---
It's a big plus if you have experience from raiding in vanilla.
---
In the end we all play this game to socialize and to have fun, and the goal of Hellion is to be a great place to relax after a long day of work/school. We will be running PVP premades and other fun stuff on off days.
---
Our requirements to be a part of the guild:
---
⦁	You are a team orientated player, what's best for the team has priority over you. We gear the raid to progress. Be cool with a transparent loot council and realize that you will get your stuff faster if we kill stuff faster. 
---
⦁	You can level to 60 somewhat fast and commit to 3 raids a week, 3 hours per raid. Most likely Wed/Sun/Tue 20:00-23:00. 
---
⦁	You know your class and play it well, can think and act in stressfull situations and show up prepared to every raid. Strategy, consumables, pre raid bis gear and enchants.
---
⦁	Willingness to build a positive reputation for the guild. You represent all of us when you wear the &lt;Hellion&gt; name. Act accordingly.
---
What we offer:
---
⦁	Mature and experienced vanilla guild and raid management.
---
⦁	An opportunity to clear all the raids in Classic without insane commitment requirements.
---
⦁	New friendships that will hopefully last a lifetime!
---

They took combinations out to balance the faction race/class choices. There used to be dwarf mages as well

Did you check the promotions folder (if you use Gmail ... not sure if other emails have a promotions-like folder)? Mine was in the promotions folder.

Soul shard bags would like a word with you.
---
I don’t see how guild banks and account security are relating.
---
This post is really making me wish Classic was launching earlier in the Summer. My college classes are going to eat up most of my time... I was planning on spending 8 hours a day playing but at this rate I’ll be lucky to get 8 hours a week.
---
How about you start assuming what's best for people?
---
Yeah just like there was nothing in wetlands for horde
---
Hand of Justice stops being BIS in AQ once you can get Badge of the Swarmguard (and already have Drake Fang Talisman).
---
I mean... you might as well accept that you will be playing Horde without her or have to roll the inferior Alliance cowards if you wanna play with her. If she only cares about making her character cute, Orc sure as fuck ain't it. Female orcs look like they got beat ruthlessly with a goddamn bat by Babe Ruth on cocaine and just walked it off instead of going to the doctor.
---
I think trolls look pretty good, but I don't remember them well from Classic, I only remember the revamped models look from... Mists? WoD? I can't remember exactly which expansion. So even they might be pretty gross in Classic. I think the only objectively "good" looking female characters in Classic WoW are NE, and Humans are decent, that's about it.
---
If Classic does well and they keep going straight into TBC, she can roll a BE which is the best female race of all, but that doesn't help you right now.
---
I came in 1/2 way  through BC and was there full-dick for Wrath, I am so hyped.

---
A new unrelated video in the same style. Some people are enjoying these skits lol
---
Yeah, I stared in November 2005 so leveling BGs were part of my experience from day 1.  There was also plenty of WPvP over resources in contested zones, hell I even remember being in a lowbie raid to the Barrens while I was questing in Ashenvale, which was fun until higher level players showed up on the Horde side.  I know there are people that want more of that sort of thing, but I hope BGs come out sooner than currently planned as leveling brackets are the greatest catch up mechanic in the game and are a way to have tons of fun without any focus on progression or rushing the cap.
---
Asmon is showcasing how nostalgic the "difficulty" of Vanilla WoW was. I mean a full raid of Level 30's cleared their way through pre-raid ZG mobs.
---
We all made bad choices in vanilla, don’t beat yourself up about it. I played resto druid exclusively wearing leather and went ham on getting that dungeon tier set. The one with the birds on the shoulders. It’s terrible for healing
---
6/10 needs more Mountain Dew code red.
---
Just as much as playing any game is wasted time in suppose.
---
Jokes on him. I’m Rolling shadow to pvp and enjoy every minute of it  🤷🏻‍♂️
---
None of us did. I made it to 40 something on my Dwarf warrior and never even knew this quest line existed. LOL
---
Bummer, thanks!
---
RP-PVP Servers
---
Will Smith was great in this movie.
---
A lot of guilds had a secondary account that was shared between officers, many more just allowed all the officers to login to whosever account had the Guild Bank character.
---
my point being that you set a very low bar for considering balance. endgame raids look like this https://i.redd.it/gr3xmh9ky9s21.png
---
maybe its just too much to ask for raids to not be 1/4th warriors
---
Anyone can get thrash blade, but HOJ? One of the best trinkets you can get in the first 2/3 of classic! Extra attacks FTW!
---
is that true for vanilla or pservers? (i heard pserver HoJ is nerfed by ~40%)
---
Also depends if your raid group is using DKP too always can out bid but feral like they said is usable in raids can OT bear then go kitty for dps like fury Wars
---
I completely disagree. BFA does the superficials well, but no cutscenes, no art assets, no mount or transmog options will be enough when the fundamental values of the game are broken.
---
I hope that guy is just playing it up for the camera because otherwise, what a complete manchild.
---
Pwetty puppy! 
---
If I wasnt a member of the nobeta club I would nearly give it to you for brightening my evening! :)
---
What are those shoulders and head? I remember my brother having them on his hunter
---
Rule 74: Knowledge equals profit.
---
I can't help but feel like some of these addons will only detract from the vanilla experience. A lot of bosses would have felt easier back in the day if people had things like weakauras and bossmods with modern capabilities.
---
None would be an exaggeration.
---
Thats...how you play on low levels, you know, right? Its not like you can respecc between dungeon spec and leveling spec. You go DD/ Support spec and try to do your best.
---
Pretty sure that was just a p-server thing.

I'm sad this guy doesn't stream on twitch, would watch for sure, chill and actually looking into stuff
---
Maybe not as bad as riccar but I started in tbc and it took me 8 months to get to 70.
---
I made twinks in p decent gear. Beats me how I could afford it with no lvl 70.
---
Blizzard changed a lot of items to not be able to proc themselves in 1.9.
---
r/hydrohomies
---
Okay that is cool to hear. I like Paladin like many others quite much cause of Lore and style, but feels too one dimensional so the twisting would have brought at least something.
---
You.... you're good at this. How could you possibly have known that?!
---
Modern WoW is a cesspool of “get gud” toxicity. I totally understand why people are anxious going into the Classic experience.
---
Focus, since you can emulate it with addons.
---
Agree guild bank, for account security, even if it was more expensive and restricted.
---
I hope that they will allow an add-on the query the server for completed quests, this will save GM time when people get lost in quest chains.
---
Explain that to the shareholders, DoA game in 3months.
---
Feral is a decent enough raiding spec, especially if you know how to play. It has a high skill cap
---
Azerite gear removed a degree of randomness. It doesn't WF/TF or have sockets. The vast majority of it can be specifically targeted. Unfortunately, randomness isn't the problem with it.
---
I love it
---
Hahahaha brilliant
---
Unfortunately, though, that would also unfairly increase the ground that suboptimal specs have to make up. They're already at a substantial disadvantage as it is.
---
Classic's meta isn't ultimately going to change. We should adjust our approach to the game and our mindsets accordingly. There's a lot of replay value in making the suboptimal specs work that players would be foolish to deny themselves.
---
Tangentially related: for years after that movie came out I thought Treebeard was implying logic worked differently at hobbit size. The obvious connection between "very small" and "more stealthy/harder to notice" genuinely never occurred to me.
---
This despite having grown up with the Tolkien books and understanding perfectly well the sneakiness of hobbits.
---
...I am not a clever man.
---
I leveled a paladin to 60 and didn't know I could use judgement to cause extra damage. Literally only used seal of command + auto attack all the way to 60. No idea how I endured it..
---
The game starts at 60 afterall, better cut it down to 4 hours of sleep. /s
---
Which I assume is in large part to the Azerite gear being a complete and total failure.
---
What, do you not have one?
---
No one cares if you're a rapist as long as you can raid lol
---
People are so crazy
---
If you're good just about everything can be forgiven...
---
Good thing about is that if you DO stay awake for it, there will be a lot less people in starting areas than at 6 pm.
---
Sure, any class will do better with a pocket healer.
---
In general though, rogues trade great damage and control with cds for sub par damage without them. Heals and dispels are great, but they don't make up for the fact that you only get to use prep once ever 10 minutes.
---
That said, if you want to play rogue and you have a friend who wants to heal, go for it.  You'll have fun.
---
That’s the blue hunter pvp ranked gear for alliance.
---
That doesnt matter. By 18 you have multiple quests that have offered a green shield and 1h weapon
---
Just not talked about much I suppose is what he means! I've never been there much myself, even though I spent some time in the zones around
---
uhh, I'm not sure about your RNG but I had INSANE issues trying to get the better ilvl pieces with the better azerite traits I wanted. Considering at launch it was run mythic dungeons each week -&gt; oh didn't get it LUL sucks. You also then had to PVP to have better chances at getting an azerite piece. And then hope at a chance at personal loot RNGfiesta that you can get a piece to drop (probably won't) or someone to trade it to you (but then they also have to get duplicate pieces for them to likely do so)
---
Mate it's 2% proc rate. That's what says on the item, that's how it is in classic, and that's how it is on pserver.
---
That’s part of the charm, imo. Not everything was polished... like Desolace,
---
It really depends on how aggressive you're being. If you want to really min/max then the priest will be using their mana often to supplement damage and feed the warlock more mana via HP which means the priest will want to tap up 24/7 if possible.
---
If you're just casually leveling with the priest topping up the warlock and assist with wand while the lock melts stuff then you don't have to worry about procing spirit tap.
---
Its hard to recommend or give input, when you say like everything, and you will play all types of gameplay.
---
How do you know it's constipated?
---
Druid can do everything and sounds more up your alley.
---
Oh don't act holier than thou. Rage clips have been on the internet since forever.
---
You're already making a concession with ConsolePort that you're trading efficiency and efficacy for comfort. Most specs can level just fine on a handful of abilities, and you probably shouldn't be using the addon in raids anyway.
---
From a horde perspective, it's here and ashenvale where the real fighting starts. We get a pretty cushy ride through barrens and then everywhere past the stupid cow escort is a flight. Good times.
---
You could add in the set bonus for the rogue dungeon set to restore 35 energy and do a ton more dps. I miss stuff like this, they do have random things like this in BFA but they do not impact the game as much to really matter like they did in Vanilla. It was one of the many reasons Vanilla was so much more fun.
---
It's ok. My first character was a rogue in TBC. Level 62 and had level 20 gear
---
I can assure you it's not fake. I've played wow since beta in 2004. It's been in my old bedroom at my parents probably since 2006.
---
I moved out in 2008 so my remaining belongings have been preserved until I was cleaning it out yesterday.
---
I just thought it was a nice piece of nostalgia to look at and get hype. I understand some of the loot is difficult to get, but we all have delusions of grandeur when we play. What's better is I played hunter and priest in vanilla so my best guess was I theory crafting for a max spell damage mage.
---
There's potential for some really neat achievements in Vanilla.  It's a shame that Vanilla stuff was kind of glossed over when achievements first came out since it was no longer relevant.
---
I raided as a shadow priest in vanilla on retail and private servers. I am so excited to play again. Is there a discord for shadow priests?
---
Depends how long your arm is.
---
Not the boss boss but ironside specifically. I think he might have just been making shit up
---
You haven't done your research on how layers will work. It's funny how the ppl with the loudest opinions seem to be the ones who don't really know what they're talking about.
---
I wouldn't call not getting the loot you want, when you want it, "cancer."
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bto1jk/two_moons_in_the_classic_beta/
---
Woohoo!
---
I mained a night elf hunter in vanilla.  Never used my pet past lvl 20 due to how much it pulled trash and ended up being marksman, which to be fair was the better spec back then.  But that’s just something I really needed to learn how to manage better was the pet.
---
Wtf is haste
---
One of my fondest memories was during my first dungeon, a gem dropped and I rolled need because I needed it for crafting. I was kicked after being berated with hate for a few minutes. It was glorious
---
Let the world pvp  shenanigans being! That and crossroads lol
---
Best post in this sub all week
---
Haha, fair point because that’s how I feel. Thanks for replying anyways!
---
HATED this zone. Luckily you can rush through the quests fairly quickly.
---
can someone explain these dungeon runs for gold? Is that a serious thing or just because private servers dont have population for gathering profession profit? Like you see all these videos 50-100 Gold/hour but i think simple arcane crystal farm was way more than that back in the day.
---
Remember to make sure nobody interferes with your data.
---
Why I play having lots of bandages, food, pots, buffs from cooking alchemy and engineering. No need to rush it anyways.
---
Aha, okay that makes alot more sense!
---
I’ve never played WoW before, I used to watch my cousins play when I was really young and they told me about classic, can’t wait to play with them.
---
I'm just gonna not watch any content creator who talked smack about classic.
---
I play on a pserver and yeah that’s how we deal with the general. 
---
My roommate was our guild hunter for a bit and sucked badly, we had to teach him how to kite lol. We had a rogue do it once and it worked ok
---
Oh that makes alot of sense! Thank you&lt;3
---
For the typical warrior pre lv 60 tank, yes.
---
Asmon just called you out. You better deliver if he does it.

Made another one https://imgflip.com/i/320gwe
---
**Benevolent Elephants**. A US Alliance, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: 2 raid nights to be decided once majority get close to 60. However they will be 2 of Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursdays. (With a possible 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: Also to be decided once majority get close to 60, but somewhere in the 6:30pm-12am PST range. For 3-4 hours
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: Loot Council, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exactly details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time.

That's like the icing on the shit cake lol, Azerite gear's not dysfunctional or a failure, it's just boring. The real problems are the character progression curve, the leveling component of wow being downgraded from being THE game to the annoying 20 hour long unskippable tutorial to the game, and more.
---
Good luck with that. I’ve wasted hours trying to get players to help test out really simple things, like complete a single gray quest to see if reputation is reduced, and people just ignore you. They’re too busy playing to help test things out. Maybe you’ll be more successful. If I could bring my 2nd account into the Beta that would make things so much easier to test.
---
I keep seeing people asking  for guild banks, it needs to stop. 
---
Stop asking for changes. 
---
VANILLA! Not BFA. 
---
Go play retail.
---
Right there with you. Love achievements I really dont think they have any effect on gameplay.
---
OP, So.. have you noticed all the spelling errors as noted by other comments?
---
Excited we finally get to know the truth after all these years Haha. I know you are too!
---
I leveled up in vanilla as a prot warrior because i didnt think i could tank in dungeons  if i wasnt prot specced. Getting to lv60 took its sweet time. But it never bothered me. Not even once.
---
So am I. Hope it happens as they promised, hopefully much sooner as well.
---
Hey, at least your repair bill isn’t insane. RIP my bank account as a warrior tank.
---
Should note that being a warlock is seen as taboo in Horde society, but Thrall recognizes how powerful they are, and therefore how much power they bring to the Horde. When the Siege of Orgrimmar began, Garrosh had all the Warlocks in the city executed and their bodies strung up in the Cleft of Shadow, for the reason you said.
---
Volley was removed in cata, I remember because I was sad seeing it in the hunger changes
---
yeah ok so he should use it at an INTENTIONALLY BAD TIME because it has a higher chance to resist
---
nice argument you absolute donkey
---
looks too complicated. my plan is to just lose the career, family, and friends again while going through a major health crisis until they find me dead in my molding chair.
---
worked differently, it did bonus damage to stunned targets
---
I remember seeing Rogues with Thunderfury, which is just beyond retarded.
---
But it Doesn't feel as bad though missing with 1 handers. Plus I'm going to be the dedicated tank for my leveling party and main tank for my guild at 60 i dont need 2h skill.
---
Your character looks so strange... it’s like you’re half human half night elf
---
You could use it while moving, talking mostly about pvp
---
The game blew up by the end of 2004. It was _everywhere_. The numbers were fucking staggering. Thats when the masses joined.
---
Off hand maybe. They just feel better and I'll be prot at 60 so i need the skill.
---
I keyboard turned and clicked spells.
---
BC is when I finally changed.

How could anyone say bad about this guy? He spends countless hours on his FREE leveling guides (which are unmatched in terms of quality). The same people who talk smack will probably end up referring to his guide when they get stuck on the way to 60.
---
Is that such a bad thing to do? I guess maybe without asking first, but even so doesn’t sound super bad

...I stayed for 2 weeks in Loch Modan because I did not know grey mobs give no experience.

So that's why those swing trackers are important in vanilla/classic. Thanks!

Cleared Naxx yes, I said entered Naxx.

receiving discarded in development content post-naxx is something everyone should want

we receive our no-changes and then dont have to deal with every server dyhing as soon as naxx is on farm , which will happen.

Cast bars, dot timers, updated character stats.

Thought we still had it in Cata, but only could remember 100% for sure last using it in ICC and the ICC 5mans to pad the meters in Zerg/Farm content trash packs.
---
Side note but unrelated entirely: this reply taught me that Zerg is in the predictive text dictionary on Gboard.
---
i leveled my first char - a shaman - in ~4 months, without knowing what i was doing.
---
now this tool tells me i need 4 months with 20h/week - it's probably way less, but we'll see.

Trading didn't have a message pop up before accepting a trade in Vanilla WoW

Looks at the meme.

Looks at OP.
---
Oh no. It's retarded. 
---
(Fixed it for you)
---
Mmm, they're not entirely wrong, they both do the same thing just in a different way. Sharding involves grabbing people from other realms and putting them in the same instance, like you would find in x realm BG's. Layering also moves random players into instances together, but it's done locally as if people on the same realm were heading into the same dungeon. It's also less invasive because with sharding you get moved randomly between instances whereas layering keeps you in the same instance until you log out. I don't think layering will be detrimental, but it's definitely not ideal because there are some pretty bad problems it causes aside from world PvP, that being we'll be missing out on a lot of potential connections with people we would've normally interacted with had we been able to see them. It's but a temporary solution, albeit not a good one, the best of the options.
---
I’m the same way. People keep saying it will just destroy the game and they’re completely overreacting. And saying that other classes shouldn’t be allowed to engage in endgame content because they level slightly faster is just mind boggling to me. Class identity should mean something. If I want to play as a stalwart defender of the light who imbues his shield with holy power, I should be able to enjoy the endgame just like anyone else.

"All wallpapers are in 1920x1080" damn I was so excited
---
There was also a trinket for WLs in BWL which doubles the damage of your demons for 20 seconds or so.
---
Once 2.0 dropped the new WL Felguard summon was wrecking people people in duels on its own with that thing.
---
They nerfed it soon afterwards though IIRC.

Agreed

---
question: does multi shot do more single target damage than arcane shot? I See people include it in pve rotations all the time, even for single target dps, never really been sure why a dedicated single target dps move isn't high priority in a rotation. and multi shot is always talked about in pvp.
---

Would you be willing to make some ultrawide versions?
---
Imagine Rag is in the open world and you have to fight every other guild to tag him.
---
Luckily warlocks enslaving the trash makes it a lot easier. God I hope that's not just a quirk of the private servers.. 
---
Wait a minute, the warlock trinket is useless.. I hope it's just as obnoxious to do as in vanilla!
---
Thanks for the feedback I’ll take a look
---
I played shaman in vanilla, leveled all the way up to 55 before I realized I didnt do my totem quests :)))))
---
1% of players killed a raid boss in Vanilla, any raid boss.
---
Entering Naxx doesn’t matter, you could do that solo.

Berserking is awesome. I put it into a macro with trinket activation and other stuff like PI/AP and it is lit.

&lt;𝙽𝚘  𝙿𝚕𝚊𝚗  𝚁𝚎𝚚𝚞𝚒𝚛𝚎𝚍&gt; is an EU - Alliance - PvP guild that intends to aim high in Classic. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.

The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it, and we do it properly. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. Although we hold heavy emphasis on PvE content, PvP will not be absent from the guild's many activities. As for our activities, our members are not expected to, but are encouraged to join us as we embark on journeys such as fishing, world boss hunting &amp; more!

Yeah no we lost volley and got a buffed multishot, I remember because there was a hunter who I used to watch religiously when I was younger (tribunal? I think) and he made a video of cats beta where he was trying to aoe farm without volley
---
As someone said Frostadamus has a YouTube vid of grinding on the bats in EPL, as their grey items and crap vendor for a lot of gold. They are high level mobs, so worth skinning and a chance (even low) of high level drops!
---
I loved Druid healing tbc/wotlk it was my main and I would get other classes to 70/80 and drop them cus none could compare. Saying that, I don’t have any of those feelings towards classic druids.
---
As a vanilla assassination rogue I'd say that's pretty much the 'how to play rogue'. 
---
Mandatory: Thistle Tea, 5/8 NS, ZG trinket and a stupid MH dagger. Join AV
---
Yup. No shame in a bubble hearth, didn’t die, didn’t lose.
---
If you are willing, the community will probably need more druids.
---
Dunno how it's done, but tanking got a whole lot easier post 1.11.
---
Arcane shot is nearly worthless in vanilla. The name of the move is counterintuitive but multishot is strong single target ability. Perfect follow up after an aimed shot.
---
Thats actually a valid tactic for warriors until lv 40 :D
---
The only +armor gear is on rings, trinkets and weapons though. Rest is just stats. Saying that, collecting that gear for tanking and then even a resto set as well is definitely time consuming.
---
Look up hunter pvp videos. Most skilled hunters spend their arcane shot/aimed shot cooldown on aimed shot like 95% of the time. Spending a 3 minute cooldown trinket to get in 183 damage is just sad honestly.
---
i honestly think it looks terrible. looks like T-1000. I prefer OG water. more watery feeling
---
They’ve always been there
---
Anyway to get these without using steam (is dreamscene still decent for these?)
---
Reading this only make me more excited for Classic. Thank you
---
!RemindMe 7 Days  "Is this guy about to get a tattoo?"
---
How are you going to keep track of threat in a 10 minute fight though? How do you know as the warlock casting shadow bolt that you are close to tank threat without knowing how the tank’s side of the fight has been going? I think dps would have to severely limit themselves to never pull Aggro, which might lead to fights getting too long and frustrating wipes being the norm. 
---
Or you would have to have everyone do the math in their head from the numbers they are seeing which sounds incredibly counterproductive to having a fun gameplay experience.
---
I remember playing in a RP raid at the beginning of vanilla WoW and they didn’t use damage meters or threat meters and it was an absolute shit show. I think we killed the first boss after many, many tries. Part of that was bad DPS not doing damage, the other being DPS doing well but pulling aggro off the tank because of the lack of information (it’s likely the tanks weren’t very good either, probably avoiding certain abilities for RP reason or something). The game sadly doesn’t really give information through gameplay on who has high threat before it’s too late.
---
Just chuck the phone in there with an obnoxious ringtone on max volume and pick it back up when all the trash is dead
---
Is it open-source? Could get more help from other devs.
---
Wow this guy has an annoying yell
---
It's not like those first 10 talents points will actually matter. And even then it's better to put most of them into arms tree, even for protection warrior.
---
Not quite Vanilla but my retarded WL friend went full on AP sockets in BC so "his demons hit harder"...
---
Havent laughed that hard ever i guess...
---
&gt;You are so shit you think 'Lava Run' = 'Ironfoe run'
---
Fuck me, this sub is toxic.
---
Not in the looks department, though.
---
Getting that deviant supreme recipe. IIRC netted about 120 gold on my server, I dropped it twice, learned it the first time around because I had no clue how much worth it was.
---
Fished until I had my epic mount.
---
What roles do you think? I hear their healing in pvp isn’t great
---
Hey add me on discord Crimsoneagle#3839 we have a guild that might suit your interests!

&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 8pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at Crimsoneagle#3839 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly.
---
Can’t go wrong with those bottles! But, have you tried the Laphroaig Quarter Cask??? so good :)
---
Apparently I'm way faster than normal. On nost I did like almost all the quests (almost entirely levelled on green quests, even did a lot of grey) and all dungeons and stuff and I got to 60 as a warrior in I think less than 10 days. 
---
Back in vanilla it took me 13 days, if I remember correctly, and I was doing so much shit (I was 14), playing battlegrounds and what not. Pretty sure an average player would be way faster than that.
---
check out the guys who played on p servers. The only chill retail player i've seen is Ziqo. They are much more chill.
---
Never liked it, even playing Tauren chars. Just a bleak horrible zone!
---
Also the PvP gloves with +dmg% to Multishot. It's BiS until mid TBC.
---
Pretty sure warriors aren't even that slow. Certainly faster than something like palas.
---
Warriors just have absolutely terrible early-game leveling that people attribute to the whole 1-60 process. They pop off around 30-40 and become decent.
---
Winners
---
Ninja looting items off the cross-faction Auction House: priceless
---
Definitely gonna need something, resets aren't the way to go about Classic.
---
Plain "attack power" increases both. Melee attack power like blessing of might is useless for ranged hunters (you can raptor strike tho).
---
It's BFA water and it looks terrible
---
I think he is playing it up
---
Ardbeg is the next on the list, will definitely try the quarter cask though!
---
right into TBC is fine but that is such a bigger undertaking than what they did to reignite classic id imagine. so many systems.
---
This is true. Good call.
---
i don't really want to argue about it, I just meant you could get a double arcane shot with the multishot
---
So what?  Do you play the game to have fun?  That's what most people do.
---
11 million people.... not all of them were your vision of autistic superiority. lol dumbass
---
People that use questie and say that questing is better at classic because you have to read the quest text and explore the world are hypocrites.
---
Way to misinterpret what he's saying.
---
It means that he should be prepared for it to resist.
---
&gt; Plugins  
---
Define this
---
Yeah I did back then :D
---
Still funny if I think back now. Few months later I was the main tank of my guild in MC. And a few more month later I was the best known tank on my server, we all start small as noobs :D
---
Solo leveling they are slowest afaik in terms of speedruns
---
ZF next?
---
Rumsey Rum and Gnomes
---
ehh it had enough quests to make it kinda worthwhile. as long as you took the proper quests to get there thru ashenvale as a NE.
---
For mages its actually frost / arcane because in raids you don't want that worthless ignite debuff taking room from more powerful warlock curses.
---
I really love these, especially the starting zone ones, please consider adding more of them using other weather effect.
---
Top quality work mate.
---
Does anyone remember dragging that giant ass dragon up to the gates of stormwind for a good time?
---
Titles existed, e.g. honor titles
---
I grinded 30-40 as a holy paladin solely off mobs on a random small island in Strangle Thorn Vale because I thought it was the fastest leveling method. No quests , no dungeons.
---
Animations and models. No one has fond memories of classic because of how it looked, but because of how it played. Being an elitist over visuals shows an unhealthy obsession over reliving your childhood more than anything.
---
nope, its actually 1,1% on private server, they nerfed it themselves, along with other changes to make classic more enjoyable (net ability to prevent dm gold grind etc)
---
So nothing. I'd actually love if they did this. It being an insult or not isn't the point.
---
In vanilla arcane shot never scales, it will always do the same damage no matter what your stats are. Multi-shot, in the other hand, is based on your damage + flat amount so its your second highest damaging ability other than aimed shot.
---
Don't pretend you don't know  
---
lol @fire mage in vanilla
---
Is it the case for Classic Beta?
---
You posted a 8 minute long video of you whining about addons
---
I hope you find enjoyment in the game dude, don't let this get you down
---
The term "ninja looting" only applies to stealing items from a group
---
True, but still a fucking kick ass video
---
&gt; you're completely hopeless in pvp until 60 and geared 
---
What. Warriors are only weak pre-30 because they have literally zero in-combat mobility in PvP.
---
Once you have intercept/berserker rage and tools like that, you can outplay basically anything that isn't a mage.
---
yeah its the one you had to get the Khazam pass for I think, it has been a while.
---
I imagine so, I hit 27 in 2 days on the classic beta as a priest
---
The only addons I use in bfa are a damage meter and DBM, and I do mythic raiding weekly. I will likely use the same / whatever version is available for classic. Otherwise I don’t use other addons but to each their own.
---
Nice
---
If I go Pally, first order of business is getting 4 other Paladins to commit to Verigans Fist by 22.
---
No. You didn't have a choice between showing it or not, and there was no other "titles" in the game, so calling it titles is pointless. In vanilla it just says what rank you are, that's it. It's not a title, it's just your rank.
---
Those who don't prepare are going to be crushed Jade loving durids
---
I think that one fella, you know, the warrior guy, yea he was projecting some sort of self fantasy like a lot of LitRPG authors these days.
---
curse of weakness has a cast time lol
---
I'm sure I ran into you in a LOT of dungeons. ;)
---
Hell, you should be normally kiting from level 1.
---
It's basically the hunter equivalent of instant burst given that none of their useful shot are instant in the first place. Aimed &gt; Auto &gt; Multi &gt; Multi &gt; Auto is fast enough to count as burst in PvP and any part getting a crit will probably net you a kill.
---
You purists will complain about everything. Don't forget to use a CRT and limit your bandwidth.
---
No, it drops off the Duke and you can’t summon him until AQ event.
---
No one said it doesn't exist, the question was why is this popular. You'd have to be brain dead to think this man-child is funny.
---
I levelled as prot to about level 45. I switched to arms because a friend begged me to. I remember leaving the town with a two hander and feeling so awkward without a shield. Then I cast slam on a mob and took off 3/4 of its HP. I felt like a right muffin for wasting so much time.
---
I don't have an ultrawide monitor, so I was unsure of working with ultrawide without knowing how it'd look. If someone provided me with ultrawide source footage, I'd be willing to edit the video to make the seamless loop and optimize it as usual. I just wouldn't be able to double-check it for quality on my own.
---
Hey guys! In retail I “layer” my abilities so that when I hold shift a different set of abilities show, and in Classic I would intend to layer different ranks of abilities on top of eachother, is that possible? Is there a replacement for the macro I use? Will this work even? Thanks in advance! This is what I use.
---
(#)showtooltip
---
/cast [mod:shift] Power Word: Shield; Vamperic Touch
---
They do the same thing in the same way.  The only difference is that sharding is zone based and layering is continent based.
---
Enchanted my 2H hammer on my Druid with a enchant quest reward from Blasted Lands and then autoattacked in caster form for ages (alongside HoTs and DoTs) because the enchant made my hammer look fiery which I thought made it really powerful.
---
After seeing the stupid state that Classic is in?  I highly doubt it.
---
In early vanilla sure, but AQ/Naxx was fire all the way.
---
Hey! Thx for responding to my post. Definitely interested in your guild, saw your LFG post. Let me know if I need to fill out a guild app or anything
---
&gt; It's but a temporary solution, albeit not a good one, the best of the options. 
---
i agree completely. I just cant stand all those screaming 'im gonna farm blacklotus on my hundreds of layers all day long' anymore :D
---
no fucking way
---
Design philosophy, in tbc/wotlk I felt like a cozy healing blanket for the raid, I liked that kind of healing. I felt like the healer version of a affliction lock and loved it.
---
QoL Druid things like not having to pop out of form to herb
---
Feral/boom are low end dps classes
---
Two players trying to exchange items over the AH equals a group.
---
For sure, I was thinking the same. Just thought it was worth mentioning in the event that the OP isn’t aware of how many more abilities/buttons we’ll have
---
Classic isn't Vanilla.  Just like Vanilla isn't Classic.  
---
1.12 is just .... lol.
---
2, your mother and I
---
If it's casual, play whatever you want. Druid can tank just fine casually.
---
Idk why didn't blizzard create a digital list of all numerical values back then. That could be to determine if something is wrong. For example if they needed to rebuild part of the game they could consult the list.
---
I see it a bit different. Give the warriors the BREs, Dark Edges, give the pallys Sulfuras , Kalimdors Revenge, even ashkhandi. Because a warrior will still want BRE or dark edge even after getting Kalimdors. Give the less BiS pvp weaps to pallys or even hunters who appreciate them.
---
No replies because you just clapped every single one of them.
---
I managed to do it as a kid in vanilla, so can't be too hard. Have also done it on a pserver which went very smoothly. Only difference compared to my mage levelling (also on pserver) is that I levelled almost entirely off green quests and mobs on my warrior. So it's slower, but it's not difficult at all, you murder everything if you just outlevel it a bit. 
---
My mage was nice because I could kill a ton of stuff my level or higher, even elites. But on average it didn't feel much better or worse to level, since you're not really noticing lets say ~10-20% extra time spent when you're actually in the middle of it, it's only on /played it shows up.
---
They surely will try, but 40 ppl and 2 pieces of loot per boss, and no achievements? Can’t really see the benefit of being a buyer in classic tbh. It’s not like you can stack armor type and trade loot.
---
Seriously dude?
---
1: after you hit 60, just enjoy yourself until then unless you find something incredibly hard, you could be doing something wrong like int stacking as a rogue
---
2: Yes to both.
---
Which is true?
---
Boeing are fly by wire, not airbus buddy
---
First thing I did when I logged into the beta:  
---
Video settings &gt; Liquid Detail &gt; poor/low/whatever it was to make it vanilla.  
---
Huge improvement.
---
Probably the best intermediary zone to level in.  Very nice central hub in Sun Rock Retreat, and good quest clusters makes this a very efficient zone.  I usually finish about 3/4 - 2/3 of The Barrens, then hit this zone up to get a level or two before finishing The Barrens off.
---
People need to stop asking for this "QoL" stuff. If it wasn't in Vanilla, it shouldn't be in "Classic."
---
is that always true or only true after a certain gear threshold?
---
Rogues are super. Good in both pvp and pve. They are a strictly DPS class but have alot of utility for solo play and in raids. I would read a few general guides to make sure the whole play style is appealing before investing the 10days of play to make it a lvl60.
---
Nothing to fill out. Are you currently subbed to Retail WoW? We play on Bleeding Hollow if you wanted to make a character and I can fire off an invite.
---
It's worth noting, Axe spec (even when you're not Orc) has interesting properties above what Sword does.  
---
I wish to all fuck the thread was still there or there was an archive of it, but there was a super old thread on EJ, that's referenced [here.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table)  
---
&gt;In a thread on ElitistJerks, a user named Vulajin kept track of his critical hit rate over many many Backstabs.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;He corrected for all possible factors he could think of, and in the end discovered that the rate he got was consistent with his attack being resolved using **two** die rolls: A first roll to determine whether the attack missed (using the assumed miss chance for the mob targets he was attacking), and a second roll to determine whether an attack that didn't miss was a critical hit (using his tooltip Crit chance adjusted for the mob target's level).
---
Basically, if this is true (and it's generally accepted that it is) yellow attacks work off two rolls, not one.  
---
Meaning Axe spec vs Sword spec isn't as simple as 5% crit vs 5% extra attack. Sword procs are **always** white damage, Axe procs **are not always** white. So, sword spec procs happen all in one roll, do you hit, miss, parry, block etc all in one go. Axe procs (sometimes) roll with do you hit/miss/block/parry first, and then if you crit/don't crit second. Which means for yellow attacks your crit is artificially inflated beyond that 5%.
---
I realized tanking AOE mobs in BRD that I wouldn't die as fast if I had a shield on. Yeah.. at level 60.
---
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8.
---
It's not that, it's the fact that they purposely put an insane amount of RNG on important pieces that change your DPS by a metric fuckton with you having zero choice in what you can do about it.       
---
I specifically remember the huge DPS boosts when I'd finally was lucky enough to get pieces that other people had already because they're RNG was better. Especially from fucking m+ caches, a 385 in the first tier when it was a trait that was bis was huge for some specs.          
---
I have no issues with depending on tier pieces when we had those for example. Would I want the piece? Of course, but I knew it was better for X spec to get it before me via masterloot. That wasn't cancer at all because there's control in progression.          
---
Same for trinkets or any other important drops from a raid.        
---
Then before when good trinkets dropped from m+, sure it sucks if it doesn't drop but I can do SOMETHING ABOUT IT, I can keep farming a dungeon for the piece. But shitty ass azerite? Nah, hope you're a "good enough player" that you can either get the piece from a once a week mythic dungeon, or even better of a player to get it from a weekly chest, AND for it to have a trait that's an upgrade. Because 45 ilvl diff? Sorry might not be an upgrade. THAT is cancer.        
---
/Rant over for that garbage ass system
---
1. It's up to you. If you care a lot about being good/the best then probably good to read guide, if you like explore and learn the game then don't. But you definitely don't need to 
---
2. Yes it's very good at both.

Fire and arcane ?! In private servers I encountered either 0 or 1 non Frost mages

Sort of...? I agree about the animations and models mostly. For example, modern Dwarf faces are so much better, same with a lot of races. However...night elf males are possibly THE worst looking and animated model in the game.

They existed in vanilla. But loot isn't personal, and its pretty limited with MC dropping like 2 pieces of gear per boss for 40 people. Most of the stuff worth "buying" is fairly rare.
---
At the very least you won't see it for a while.
---
And at the worst I don't think it will change very much about the game. The good guilds will still generally be wealthier than the not as good guilds. Bad players will always pay for gear.
---
The release date to be early June....
---
He's not the best but he's pretty good. Which means for the *average* player...
---
I don’t think you understand what ninja looting is.  I think the term you’re looking for is ‘sniping’
---
It actually makes it way better than regrowth. Regrowth gets a terrible coefficient for its duration, cast time and mana cost. With that set you get a great coefficient on the main heal and a full coefficient on the hot. 
---
That set bonus turns greater heal into what regrowth should have been.
---
I agree. We should also remove all AQ40/Naxx gear as well since casual players can't reasonably get them.  
---
Stupid to not include the unarmored mounts.
---
I still fail to see the connection.i highly doubt top guilds were logging into other people’s accounts just to get items.

you should probably seek some professional help

School, work and wow took up as much time as work, a home and life duties take up now.

Very true! I didn't play a warlock too much in vanilla so I don't remember too much. Corruption did have a cast time though if I remember correctly?
---
Feral sucks in pvp the only spec you will be allowed to play is 11 11 29.
---
And gearing feral up in raids when you heal? You compete with melee dps, warriors and rogues have priority over you. Consider for a second how many of those there are, odds are your gearing will take a long time. After that, sure, but that takes months.

Blizzard should build horizontal content to classic wow independent from TBC. By this I mean they should hold lv60 as the ultimate level cap, but saturate the world with more stuff to do. Shame they never did "Emerald dream" as a raid content as it was once planned.
---
Azerite gear is boring because it's a failure. I don't know what happened, but something had to go terribly wrong in development. Blizzard didn't even fully unlock the system on the beta until there was basically no time left to do anything about it. It was DOA and the final nail is in 8.2.
---
Cool and all, but premade warsong on hen house is not vanilla/classic premade warsong. No way every single people will have infinite noggenfogger/consumables and the money to get renataki/bs trinket during the lifespan of classic and have a fast mount while constantly pvping.
---
it would also probably be better to spend your gold on BoEs and crafted gear than buying carries.  cause carries would probably cost alot to make it worth.
---
Alliance had plenty of low level content in loch modan, darkshore, westfall, and redridge. While horde had just this, barrens, and silver pine "which barely has any quests"
---
I actually think the exact opposite for raids. People hear about how easy it is and go in and die because you have the exact same people who stand in fire and die on retail now. If you can't get out of the big circle with DBM and a billion particle effects yelling at you right now, you aren't doing it in vanilla either.
---
You see *way* more vanilla boomers hating on retail than vice versa though.
---
How about the fact that the mount training system as a whole will be in it's pre-1.12 state?  
---
Interesting considering the topic. They're willing to keep the old mount training system but somehow unarmored mounts are a huge no.  
---
Genius.
---
Like others have said, small tweaks to underperforming specs to make them at least an option for all but the most cutting edge guilds.
---
I'm not saying make a ret pally perform at the same level as a fury warrior, or a boomkin equal to a mage, but currently there is literally no reason to bring a ret when a holy paladin brings the same tools to the fight with a negligible loss in raid dps. I find class homogenization abhorrent and i'm not at all recommending that everyone should be able to do everything, but class fantasy and fun ends as soon as you begin raiding.
---
A lot of people forget or just choose to ignore the fact that blizz was very much still learning how to balance the game and many changes that should have been implemented were put on hold for TBC release.
---
here’s an idea, we play classic. kill kel thuzad. his phylactery drops and we return it to the argent dawn but instead of it being smuggled to northrend its destroyed on the spot. chromie appears tells us we’ve just broke the timeline. it’s created a branch in the time stream. now they can write some lore, maybe have arthas move up his timetable and wotlk comes before bc. then after the lich king is dead we go into bc and fight through to illidan but we don’t kill him and instead join up with him to fight kiljaeden at the sun well.
---
hey thanks man, been looking for a map to get made for the classic wow release!
---
That's basically what their databases are. And that is the data they are using for Classic. There can still be bugs though, like the stuff about stoneskin totem not falling off, causing it to seem like some mobs hit for way less than they should. It's not that any numbers were wrong, it was just an error in their game engine which processes the numbers.
---
Even if you didn't want to macro abilities it'd still be better with stance macros so you could do all 3 stances with 2 pedals as Battle/Def &amp; Battle/Berserker pairs.
---
Seems like combat pulse is enabled... This shouldnt be the case in vanilla

Hi, /u/markbbbm

Layering is just sharding for the continent. Not really a helicopter vs airplane comparison
---
"- More graveyards"?
---
The joy about ganking is knowing that the victim must do a tedious corpse run. This is classic, if you don't like it fine. But don't try to change it, for people like you retail is right there man.
---
Peace
---
The trogg quests in loch modan give a nice green shield, as well as the westfall lighthouse murloc quests.
---
im still torn what way to go.... i mean..
---
soooo hard to choose
---
Which is ch part? Multi shot is always a fps increase because it's a flat damage shot off the damage timer. The only you wouldn't use it is during fights where mobs are CCd in close proximity.
---
Arcane shot was always bad mostly because it shares a cooldown with aimed shot, which a far superior ability that you use on cooldown. I guess you technically use arcane shot if you're leveling full BM spec or before level 20 when you get aimed shot
---
Don't forget the plate of hot pockets!
---
Yep lol
---
Unless if it specifies melee or ranged, then regular attack power gives both ranged and melee AP.
---
As a hunter you just want as much regular attack power, or ranged attack power as possible. It's equal worth as you don't usually melee.
---
Also the visually superior choice
---
Skinning is free money. Enchanting costs money.

The reputation for being that guy who gives out Minor Beastslaying in STV might be worth that cost.

Thank God it's civ 5, cause 6 blows.

Live dying = dead wow.
---
We all lose.
---
I mean its always a judgement call. If you have been to one raid and I have been to 50 and passed on BRE 5 times already, I could care less how many more HKs you have. Especially if you are going to just stop raiding after you get your weap.
---
less noobs basically lol

I think every single new character model and animation is leagues better than their predecessors.

Ug.  Vanilla hard. Retail Easy. Ug. Ug.
---
can you elaborate how you made gold fishing? like where you fished, things you sold, etc. just genuinely curious
---
assuming people know about the lighthouse quest or quested in loch modan. Missing quests is a real thing if you dont know every quest allready or use an addon.
---
While watching Asmongold running through Swamp of Sorrows in search of Somnus, I noticed that the Scalebane Captains as well as the Green Scalebanes were in fact normal mobs, and not elite mobs as they were in Vanilla. In fact, they were elite mobs pre patch 2.3, so this isn't really something that changed with patch 1.12 but in fact only in TBC.
---
Questions dodged: Too many to count
---
Is it though?
---
#Layering is just another word for sharding.
---
 Posting this was a nice exercise of your ignorance and obliviousness.
---
You mean that ONE point in reckoning a lvl 30 can pick up?
---
Over SoC, 5% crit, 8% movement speed?
---
This was in TBC but since it's vanilla zone it's basically the same thing. I was very young playing with a friend, heard from his big brother that loch modan was good leveling place for my human, didn't know how to get there. So I swam from westfall to wetlands via the moutains west, died a billion times, then couldn't find the way past the waterfall to loch modan and hearthed back. Phoned him again asked how you get there, and he said "just take the tramp". 
---
I am a purist that believes nobody should use any addons. But it's impossible to change peoples minds at this point.
---
They made the journey too short and too easy basically is what happened. In Vanilla you spend so much time in each mini-bracket that it's actually worthwhile optimizing your character and trying to get a few little BiS items here and there. That's only one part of the puzzle though...the other is that the content was hard enough to actually put your gear to the test.
---
So, you have long times spent in each little section of the game, and upgrades meaningfully changed your ability to clear content and level more quickly. Those are the ingredients you need to get people looking up dungeon loot tables for a level 30 zone, working on questlines where the XP/hr isn't great but the item is worth the time spent, and working on crafting/AHing upgrades.
---
In WotLK onwards you just take the quest items as they come and nothing is really hard enough that your gear matters until level cap anyway. TBC was the last time that I ever felt like I had to optimize my character every 2 levels and was trying to hunt down upgrades in 5 mans.
---
2k-3k
---
Who even is this that guy?
---
Stm sucks. There like 6 quests there and the level range is huge.
---
Please do tell me how well progression went for modern. Oh yes, it got to the point of hundreds of thousands of people begged for the return of a product that was no longer being provided over the span of many years of which requests were rejected and resulted in people seeking out illegal methods to be able to enjoy it again, those creating a way to risking prison time and lawsuits and now that we finally had our request fulfilled you want to give them a path to potentially create a position where we once more have to ask for legacy servers. I don't care who's working on Classic, they're still working for the same company who made modern into what it is and that same company may I remind you is merged with Activision. It's bad enough we have to worry about micro transactions making its way in and people seriously think this is a good idea lol. I swear to god if Classic+ happens you absolutely deserve what you get as a result because I'm not sticking around to see my favorite game go down the shitter again. 
---
If you want something new and different, moderns calling your name, it's still in development. If you want an unauthentic "Classic" abomination that's got a bunch of modded crap attached to it, there's those servers of which we cannot name on here you can have a field day with, but leave Classic alone.
---
same for me. Then people said I should use a shield - and voila, the shield from the 2nd(?) boss dropped. As well as the +5 stamina back. And a nice 1h one weapon.
---
Because they didn't exist for like at least a year.
---
This is possibly the laziest karma grab I've seen.
---
You can do what you want, just be aware they're objectively worse for leveling. Totally fucks up your rage generation, you miss more often, it's more difficult to keep rolling upgrades for two weapons instead of one, etc.
---
True. Overall they did drop the ball with M+ in BfA. I don't know what Blizzard was thinking when they came up with an endgame progression system that's incompatible with one of their most popular additions.
---
His popularity came from his prior streaming. He isn't a random dude who got Beta access and started streaming yesterday. He was a big Diablo 3 streamer way back in the day. He's popular because he already had a fanbase and this clip is popular because people enjoy seeing other people get mad. This is very annoying to many people but it's not a far cry from most other top clips from Twitch streamers.
---
In our guild SnD did the most damage out of the two, though during  Vaelastrasz your dps would tank compared to backstab.
---
Hey im the author of said addon and id be glad to answer your questions.
---
Fair play to you good meme
---
1000% agree with you
---
Saving this for later
---
Nothing in vanilla raids has an engaging playstyle, not sure where people always come from, bashing certain classes. Everything will be in shades of boring aside from healers, not because it's interesting, but because they need to adjust all the time.
---
And no proper keybinds either.
---
Yeah vmaps are messed up atm, its pathing related to objects. Ieg you cant charge from the trees in mulgore that you can easily just walk onto
---

---
We had a tank that keyboard turned, tanked with a one button macro (that I'm sure he clicked), and didnt know how to strafe. Cleared AQ40.
---
Feral can work as dps with enough effort.
---
Anyway, yes you can get PVP gear while healing as resto, but a lot of the good PVP gear is also used in PVE specifically for feral, and you will not be able to get those over rogue/hunter/warrior or whoeer needs for pve until they all have it.
---
Very strong in 1v1 PvP. Not great in group play.
---
Great on single target fights. Not great in group fights.
---
my first mage was arcane spec to 40+
---
Aux was so much better. Might just be my opinion but the interface was really easy to use and powerful with all the functionality of Auctioneer.
---
bless his heart....
---
Nah your mother and chuck noris.
---
Or there's the pserver try-hards that go fury for tanking because it has even higher threat generation and survivability isn't an issue if you have good healers.
---

Man instance runs are so inefficient, I wish there was a way I could get in a dungeon every 15 minutes without having to stop jacking off in Orgrimmar!

---
xD
---
Cap is 3k by layer. Personally want 5-10k. Apparently that makes me an idiot.
---
But watching 40 life bars hours on end, whilst not even really enjoying the raid is annoying to me. And it's only exeggerated in classic with lackluster bosses in the majority.
---
Why not just a time machine?
---
Cool. Those are subjective.
---
I wonder how much someone would pay to have a guild help them will all the steps for the Scepter mount.
---
It's about 8 days of farming and raiding and a guild can only get one before risking that someone else will ring the gong.
---
1. Kill Broodlord in BWL. ~1 hrs @ 39 players = 39
---
2. ~30 hours of group farming @ 4 players = 120
---
3. ~12 hours of group farming @ 4 players= 48
---
4. A 40 man raid encounter = 39
---
5. Another 40 man raid encounter = 39
---
6. Clear BWL. ~2 hrs @ 39 players = 78
---
7. Clear MC. ~1 hr @ 39 players = 39
---
8. 10 man encounter = 9
---
9. 5 man encounter = 4
---
10. ~2 hours group farming @ 4 players = 8
---
11. Another ~hour group farming = 4
---
12. Kill Onyxia = 39
---
13. Kil Broodlord again = 39
---
14. Clear MC again = 39
---
15. 20-man raid encounter = 19
---
So that's 563 man hours, we'll make it 550 because our team is fast.
---
@ $10/hr, that's $5,500, about $140 per player (~10.5 months of subscription time).
---
But, with a bidding war I bet you could get this up to $8000 easy.
---
addons existed in vanilla lol
---
Bought an expensive "Troll skin quiver" or something with my warlock gnome because trolls are cool and strong so I must need this quiver

It makes perfect sense.
---
EU horde (priest/warrior intention) lf guild with experienced raiders, the core of raiding always remains the same while the reagents change, i want to explore the wonders of vanilla once more but would like some strong endgame group to join.
---
ive been playing since 2006 and was a greenie during vanilla, started picking up the community essence mid tBC, raiding for me started at wotlk but i've played a smidge of privates to know where the heart lay, most of it seems appealing to me now through rose-glasses. but i did find the challenge there. community wise, blacklisting, patience, and most of all, exploiting most of monster mechanics on how to battle them effective.
---
i hope this appeal will stand to a voice in your heart to make one of the greater experience. my main on BfA is Dashi-Ragnaros. it aint much, but ive been playing social for now and my own playstyle. i do take Vanilla very serious and am willing to put in full effort for gearing and grinding to guild/raid's content. 
---
Serious offers only :D
---
Because sharding is literally the worst thing ever created history. Just add more servers.
---
It might have been changed at some point in vanilla. Because the last times I've seen people bringing this up I'm pretty sure people posted videos of people aoe tanking adds on Nefarian with battle shout.
---
It totally doesn’t. Barely looks like water.
---
Because of how they fly and what services those systems can provide.  
---
Airplanes require constant forward motion to fly (Few exceptions), but a helicopter can hover in place.  Helicopters can't move cargo long distances due to either their weight restrictions, travel ranges, or logistics of managing cargo.  
---
These are just a few examples off the top of my head, but there are many more tasks that each can do that the other can't.  They both serve entirely different purposes and to say they are the same "because they both fly" is incorrect and very misleading.
---
I'm not sure if it's because it's shopped so well or if it's because of the ridiculous increase in shoulder size over the years, but it actually took me a minute to decide if this was real or not.
---
Spent almost all of my money on pieces of gear from the AH that I rarely could afford my class abilities.
---
As a kid: Mailed the gold from my dad account to mine so I always had more
---
As warrior bought expensive crap off AH and bought a skill that I thought transformed me into a bull (It didn't)
---
Just play what you enjoy. Eventually you'll find people to play with, and I wouldn't be surprised if MC will be pugged a month into "progression". Just remember that most people here are either competetive, or from PServers, which is basicly the same thing.
---
It sounds like an astrology page lol, where it’s just vague enough to where people make false connections with it
---
You formed my toughts better than I could of ever expressed them myself, thänks &lt;3
---
Thats not supposed to be usable in vanilla. Its because classic uses the legion client so macros can do a lot more stuff now
---
Again, the mount system didn't change until 1.12.1, it was the same in 1.12.0.
---
And they changed it in anticipation of TBC.
---
The unarmored mounts were removed before BWL even launched. If you're going to do that, you need to change every item, spell, quest, encounter, and talent as it was changed over the course of 3 years. Blizzard is not going to open that floodgate.
---
I love this setup. Just how Blizzard wanted paladins to be IMO. And the fact that they managed to complete very challenging dungeon means that this was not a bad idea!
---
God me and my buddies wanna play on RPPVP servers so bad!
---
barber shop.
---
I generalize, level 60pala.
---
Its over exaggerated. Concerning speed levelers warrior is arguably above rogue after the 30s. Even then the leveling isnt bad with proper weapon progression via vendors and taking a safe quest path focused on speed and killing mobs below or at your level.
---
Someone mentioned "bigger noob tax". That I can agree with. Overall warriors arent awful to level at all.
---
Play the one you prefer. You can easily raid MC, ZG, Ony in dungeon blues. You can have full dungeon blues within a weekend for either class.
---
Way to defend an absolutely retarded statement, honestly.
---
&gt;rofl, tried to rely on HoJ vs an orc? lawl what a retail nub
---
Because when you need your HOJ, you should just not use it? Because it might be resisted? Or he should just magically never get into a situation where he needs to HOJ?
---
Here's my question: Why do you hate these mounts so much that you absolutely want them out of the game?
---
Pretty sure tanks have the most prep required overall, the highest repair costs (which translates to more time farming), and absences are the least acceptable for tanks. Tanking isn't really what I would go with if I wanted to keep my playing to a minimum. A low cost fast farming dps like a mage is probably the best choice for minimal play time, but a healer is also a good choice if you want to be more desired.
---
Some of them are really nice actually.
---
I feel you. I spent 12 gold (every gold I had!) on a spear for my hunter. I did so much ranged damage (and had no idea how aggro worked) that I always ended up in melee range anyway, so I figured a strong melee weapon was a good idea.
---
Yes, they were.
---
Mages- one of the coolest playstyles and some of the best abilities but also constantly ugliest armor sets.
---
There isn't a single set in the game where mages would even get into a top 5 for best looking set, they're right at the bottom all the time.
---
Dont trust gamepedia too much, its besto to use old book guides, forum posts or wowhead guides. So yes it should be level 10
---
Tactical mastery is god tier
---
I remember 6 manning a couple of classic dungeons because we didn't want to kick anyone from our team, back in the day.
---
Can't be /biz/. No French men contacted the goblin AH guild and had his entire stock of bronze tubes "accidentally" deleted.
---
Duel people. Duel each class 10 times, get a sense of the rhythm of their DPS.
---
&gt;quick run down on this stuff
---
From what you've written, it doesn't sound like you want a quick run-down but rather some pretty in-depth info.
---
Read class guides, abilities and talent trees. This, in combo with dueling, will give you a pretty well-rounded understanding of what other classes can do, your match-ups and what you can take advantage of.
---
Hehe yeh it's good stuff! My fav right now is Nikka coffey malt (japanese whisky), check it out :)
---
I really should have read this when the game came out. I made a warlock and thought dots were stupid haha. I leveled all the way to 30 before someone told me i need to use dots.
---
This isnt true whatsoever. After 30s and even a bit before if you charge first you can actually kill people quite often. Its about being extremely aggressive and not letting the enemy pull the trigger.
---
Bonus points if you pvp minmax concerning race or take time to get engineering up(which really isnt too bad to do if you are ahead of zerg)
---
On my pali I used to farm stockades for wool. On a pserver I was able to doit where I still gained xp from kills one on one farming, but I was seriously decked out.
---
I remember doing it in vanilla but I assume they were all grey by that time so at least lol 32. Good money and easy
---
T3 is pretty insane, imo. But it's the exception to the rule for sure.
---
For some reason I automatically assumed quests were there as a distraction. and grinding mobs was for hardcore players that wanted to level ASAP. Something about being a kid prevented me from thinking to research this...
---
The real problem is with the expansion system. Vanilla was all about the journey to 60.
---
Once xpacs arrived, now how do you justify selling someone 60-70 content when they are not yet 60?
---
So to be able to sell xpacs, max level became much more important and that’s where all the content was. So now because of that they need to rush people to max, or at least to the min level for the newest xpac. Otherwise no one would buy xpacs.
---
Yeah it's like saying a car and truck are the same thing cause they're both automobiles. Can't believe someone would categorize both planes and helicopters as aircrafts.
---
Thanks for this! Will definitely try some of them later
---
&gt; The problem is most people are spamming sunder when it's a lot easier to hold threat with heroic strike/cleave and clever use of battle shout at lower levels. Most of your threat is coming from straight up damage and the D-stance modifier while leveling, not the base threat that sunder gives.
---
You loose a ton of rage generation if you spam HS though? (less white hits) is it really worth? 
---
I typically use sunder and revenge on each of the mobs Im tanking, while keeping taunt for whenever a dps overaggro me on main target, and if I'm confident I've got good aggro on everything I start cleaving. It's very possible I'm not doing it optimally though, but generally I don't have any problem tanking ~4 mobs, and more is rarely needed. I could obviously do a lot more damage, but I feel like I would loose aggro if I had to wait on auto attacks for every mob.
---
I would be down with having some servers stick to the always classic version where naxx is the end, some servers with server resets after X amount of time after Naxx and some servers that either add new content or move on to TBC. The key is to let people know before they make their character or simply create new servers once the decision is made. That way the #nochanges crew can be happy on their servers while people that want resets or more content are also happy.
---
Sounds like the kind of guy that would get 2-shot by Verdan The Everliving.

Proof? Because I can also say “no they weren’t” and ignore everything else.
---
Because it opens a floodgate.
---
"We want [this change] that was in the game before patch 1.4" means Blizzard would have to entertain every single item, spell, talent, encounter, and quest that was changed over 3 years.
---
Fuck that.
---
 #nochanges means NO changes. You're playing 1.12, you get 1.12 and not the 36 patches that came before.

Level 16 currently 100000% accurate

What's the appeal? That you help a family get murdered and see that Garrosh isn't a complete monster?
---
Great job! I really like the Circle of Binding set.
---
Here’s a big tip with warriors, and really any melee: 
---
Try to do stuff 2 levels above where everyone else would be. IE instead of entering duskwood at 20, maybe grind like 18-19 mobs until you are 22-23. Out leveling mobs and quests for melee is HUGE, you will kill them so much more efficiently.
---
Your guild didn't, my guild did. Based on your arguments, there's your proof.
---
Carrier helicopter vs passenger airliner.
---
You arent managing rage well. Its very easy to dual kite mobs and you pool rage for those specific pulls to burn through one and deal with the other.
---
Obviously easier to ranged leash but this concept of 2 mobs means you die is an exaggeration as well.
---
You don't need BRE, it will be bad for your raid
---
You don't PvP
---
You get no PvP items over some one who does
---
PvPers are an advertisement for your guild. You don't give them nothing.
---
Snutz? Did he finally quit his cocaine habit?
---
gdkp runs in Vanilla were common on my server.
---
We would run them in my guild when there were very few drops in the specific raid we wanted.  For instance, TOEP, BRE, &amp; other Rag loot would still be priority to guild raiders(as well as patterns/recipes), but other items were sold for gold to a select group, usually 5-8 pugs who we brought/carried.
---
So example, we no longer need Domo loot, and we bring pug priests/hunters who want to buy the leaf/eye.  Weapons, set pieces, all had a set price, usually hundreds of gold, and if anyone we brought wanted to outbid, it went auction style to whoever paid the most.
---
At the end of the raid, the gold amount was split evenly to guild members who went on the run and did the "carrying".  Depending on drops &amp; if any auction bids happened, you could walk away with a good chunk of gold.
---
We did this for MC/BWL and the gold prices ranged from a few hundred to 1000+ for certain items.  The added gold helped fuel consume prices &amp; repair costs for us.

Be the MT for a guild's secondary team. It's like ~3-5 hours a week.
---
I know. I never said they didn't. I had the same stance back then.
---
Got proof showing your guild did?
---
Holy FUCK and I was just looking for something like this to hype myself. You're beautiful, OP.
---
Fair enough. Which of those paths will you be taking?
---
It's weirding me out how you don't realize how obnoxious you are. Classic is attracting the right crowd again haha.
---
I was 12 playing the beta just before launch and i leveled my dwarf warrior to 20 before i realized i could buy skills. And i never quested because in my experience within similar games, all you did was grind mobs xD
---
im literally talking about the nost server i played on... Nost had the highest number of unique account recorded for any private server, somewhere around 800k.
---
People don’t hate retail because it’s balanced well, they hate it because of how flying mounts and group finder have made the world feel so meaningless. The professions have been rendered null and the game has taken convenience to egregious heights with each patch. Imagine being able to play the classic experience where you truly get to experience all Azeroth has to offer while also being able to experience the identity you had in mind for your class.
---
Any chance you can make them 2560x1440? :)
---
Wear them as your armor. Carry a oversized one as your shield.
---
Got proof you're not an imbecile?
---
I played all the way through wrath on a CRT.  It worked just fine for plenty of years before LCDs became significantly cheaper around '09.
---
/yell DISMISS PETS BEFORE JUMPING DOWN!
---
No matter what race, I always quested through these zones. Stuff like ashenvale never interested me tbh. Its pretty much 1-35/40 EK and then Kalimdor.
---
Ya id rather have larger caps as well. Played on a medium realm in actual vanilla, some low pop private servers, and then nostalrius. Nost was a bit much but 2k could end up being 700 ish players with faction imb.
---
I'd suggest some different caps for different servers but thats against the #nochange religion of absolute ignorance that has formed on these forums. My pap always told me "ignorance is strength son" but even I find this a bit much.
---
Specially considering it's such an important place in WC3.
---
Only thing I really remember about the zone is the smiley face log.
---
Lol so how much do ypu have to PvP for it to count? Rank 7? Rank 10? Who decides that?  If you skip raids to do AV and another player shows up to every raid and only pvps half as much as you do, who deserves the weap really?
---
Yep and here is the proof. I start to have a theory (because everyone feel elites doing less dmg) that Blizzard screw upp all elites data and just put some portrait on them. IF they have the correct code? How can they be normal in swamp of sorrows? Make no sense.
---
Proof btw for being elites: [https://youtu.be/QiY13kEVMlo?t=1998](https://youtu.be/QiY13kEVMlo?t=1998)
---
Yeah seriously STM is fucking horrible
---
Hands down my all time favourite zone. I wish it was a 50-60 zone so it could last a little longer!
---
Hey i am down but im planning to also go warrior.
---
Well you might say so, but when you compare it to the other classes t3.. :p
---
I never heard of this
---
Im not the one making bold technical server statements with what is my guess to be literally zero data or experience to back up said claims. If you have data or experience in this area please fill me in.
---
This is the most vanilla comment i have ever seen there.
---
I assume you mean for your pet.
---
You want to start with a nice pet at lvl10 that has claw, for orc/troll encrusted silithid clawler is amazing. Using the ability a couple of times teaches you how to train it to any pet which can claw.
---
While leveling going for a cat is usually prefered, a cat can use Claw, Bite and Dash. Claw is your main dps source because it is spammable. Bite has a cooldown but is slightly more damage/ferocity but it's not enough to worry about while leveling. Dash is nice speed.
---
Use this guide: http://vanillawowhunter.com/vanilla-wow-pet-skills/
---
To find mobs with new ranks of claw and dash. I recommend getting each rank of the dash since there's so few, and a new claw about every 2-3 ranks. Try look at the guide looking for the lowest lvl mob that has it which you can fit in your route, and use that one.
---
I recommend getting a fast cat at around 35 for frenzy. Because frenzy is a flat time, having more attacks means higher uptime on the buff. Broken tooth is the fastest cat at 1.0, but you can also pick a lion from alterac mountains at 30ish, that has 1.2 speed if getting the best speed isn't that important. 
---
Lupos is not going to be doing shadow damage in classic so don't worry about him at all.
---
If you are considering if you want brokentooth or not, ask yourself if you are going to pvp before ZG comes out. If yes, then maybe it's worth, if no, then don't bother. It's a slight dps increase and you won't use the cat after you ding 60 anyway for anything but pvp. 
---
In order to train new ranks of claw btw, you need to stable your main cat, then tame new one, use it for a couple of min until you see the message in chat saying you have learned the ability to teach bite rank (whatever rank). Then abandon pet, go back and get your main pet and teach claw to it.
---
Skinning and vendor it all.
---
A metronome could play a hunter.
---
You can use the same points you are making for mage DPS. With spell batching etc they were playing with timing to intentionally clip spells with /stop cast macros, but at least that timing wasn't constant, as they had to constantly adapt their timing based on ping. So I would argue that was more skillful.
---
Blindly following a swing times while pressing 1--4--3--1--2--3--1--4 isn't skill...
---
As for pets, with interactions like interrupts, seduce etc. warlock pets are more nuanced then hunter pets. Period.
---
Warrior's, as I have stated, have a huge nuance with pooling rage, prioritizing skills, and tracking buff/debuffs. Not to mention melee is, defacto harder DPS as you are much more restrictions on positioning in fights, and tracking bosses etc. without throwing off your timings.
---
I don't feel attacked, your statement that Hunter's are highest skill cap is false because, A) following a swing times isn't that difficult or skillful, B) hunters aren't the only ones that have to worry about the same timing mechanic to clip/miss out on DPS (2h fury deals with it, casters deal with it if they are min maxing) C) Hunters only offer a single role, what about Druid's, who are arguably the highest skill ceiling in PVP just by nature of their immense tool kit.    
---
I'm not disputing that hunters have a large variance between passable and God hunter, all classes have a huge variance between the average player and the top parser. I am just saying that Hunters are not the defacto highest skill ceiling as all of the examples you have illustrated can be found or matched with nuances of other classes.
---
&gt; could invest a couple of hours on 1-2 raid evenings a week,
---
&gt;a guild in the middle of the hardcore-casual spectrum.
---
A typical raid would be more than a couple of hours per raid. Say 6:30 to 10pm or so. (3.5hr) 
---
Between casual / hardcore so semi hardcore? That'd likely be 3 raids/week.
---
So 10-11hrs/week raiding + extra time for farming etc. Plus as a tank you'd likely be wanted/hoped that you would be around to help tank outside of raid although likely not mandatory.
---
If you're a tank/main tank then you would be expected to have very high attendance. You can't have your tanks not able to raid. You generally don't have a ton of extra tanks - certainly they won't be geared like the ones being funneled gear from raids at the start.
---
The zooming in on the cig lighting was fantastic.
---
There is no proof
---
I think this is a change that even "no-changes"-sayer would accept!
---
I don't think judgment is all that anyway... I've heard rank 1 soc and just swinging is more efficient. I guess it depends on your mana.
---
The proc and not just the judgement? If so that's strong af.
---
imo Desolace was also a good revamp. Hell, I actually like a lot that Cata zones brought into the mix - aesthetically speaking. Its everything else that feels bad.
---
Thanks I appreciate you :)
---
Not really, barely any warrior will be tank specced. You will not have a 1% chance on launch.
---
WB's don't stack, right ? Wasn't that the topic a month ago, not to mention, not everyone can have WB's all the time due to internal server CD.  
---
And farming consumables for hours on end, or gold to buy them, to shave a off half an hour of raiding time seems like a bad deal, when I could just hang out with my guild, casually raiding and killing bosses. C'mon the bosses are easy. Beyond easy tbh. as long as not all of your DPS are Elemental shamans and boomkins, ooming at 75%, or people rocking lvl 30 greens, you should be fine.  
---
And with today's abundance of information, BiS lists are everywhere, including guides for everything.
---
Since I had the deviat supreme recipe I fished the fish required where WC is.

---
I've never seen this. Wish I could give it 1000 likes
---
Friend's cousin did this. It wasn't until he hit 31 on his hunter we realized he never learned spells or did any quest.
---
Apparently the main reason for horde getting Belf( I don't know if they considered giving it to ally or not), was that servers in asia were very ally sided, because players from there cared more about looks, and giving a more "normal looking" race to horde helped to balance their servers.
---
I'm amazed that you think it's possible to explain away all of the modifications to the game that they're making. Phases gear included, PVP late implementation, etc and then think that "1.12 is 1.12" is still a solid argument.  
---
They've been addressing each "state" of the game and we've been reacting. Items, spells, talents, encounters, quests. All understandable because they apparently don't have the data for those things. The unarmored mounts though? Still in the game files.
---
Sharding ruined wow. You’re an idiot.
---
It's one of those "contested" zones that should really just be horde only because you are never getting anything done here as alliance. The peak quest hub has two quests and no guards so horde can just chimp out on the npc's all day so even in the unlikely event you actually do travel all the way to the charred vale and somehow kill all the required mobs while there is 100 horde questing there you will need to wait for the quest givers to respawn before they are killed for fun again.
---
The night elf and gnome camp is also unguarded and killed for fun all the time. Meanwhile horde gets a large protected settlement in the middle of the map with roads leading to every section quickly.
---
If you are not a druid or rogue don't even think about coming here as alliance.
---
It's for PVP, and it does fine, there.
---
Haha and in some weird way, that might be actually worth it.
---
But if you were gonna tell me, you’d only pay me 200 bucks for all of that to get it for a non-guildie I’d say fuck off
---
Leave us basement dwellers be dammit
---
Blizzard said no.
---
WoW Classic is not a democracy and even if it were, you'd be in the minority.
---
Get over it.
---
It's got an arena and noggenfogger elixir though! It was also nice to come back to after being in the fucking desert for hours.
---
U da man
---
All I have is 50g! Here's 25g.
---
Well, to be fair to you the answer is "Yes and no"  
---
Free action potions are rare but they also aren't a gimmick.  
---
Everyone knows about them, but they also aren't cheap and if you honestly want to PvP the amount you'd be using unless you're in a great group is astronomical.
---
Tanking is a big subject, and the truth is, most "tactics" work just fine. I am the kind, that dosnt like heroic spam, so i take imp sunder and spam that. Its faster, cuz its an instant attack and not "limited" by your weapons speed (you dont have to wait for the next swing, so getting fast weapons IS NOT A MUST. I always said Deathbringer axe from onyxia is a fucking INSANE tanking weapon, but most nabs just laugh cuz "to slow lul". Why has quelsarar 2.0 speed then ? :D). Its also a minor melee dps increase, due to 5 sundrs beeing up asap.
---
Beeing able to tank 5 mans conforably cuz of defiance and imp sunder is such a ease, its hard to compare to the 15 rage sunder in your arms spec, that isnt doing much (agro wise).
---
But doing 5 mans when u lvl as a main source of XP can be....taxing. On your nerves :D You will be meeting all kinds of people and morons in your PUGs, and almost as important to beeing a good tank, is to be able to work with people you just met. It helps alot if you know the dungeon well. Taking the charge (leader role) is almost a must.
---
Cuz noone argues with a compitent tank.
---
...most of the time :D
---
I should name my bank alt 1R0NYMAN.
---
Holy/Disc leveling is just fine tbh. All you need from Shadow is spirit tap. After that you can go smite spec or disc for the shield bonuses and such.
---
Thanks for breaking my dreams mate. No seriously, cheers. For some reason I had this weird idea that you can clear say MC in a couple of hours. From the numbers alone it's clear that I won't be able to keep up and eventually I'll slack or burn out.

Thank you for taking the time to answer :)

Beta is only a few players and yes, invites are more or less over for now it seems.
---
I would suggest to keep an eye on the forum for stress tests.
---
It was supposed to be a contested zone though. Wetlands wmay have been contested on paper too - but there was no horde presence at all. The contest part came from 3rd parties. Meanwhile stonetalon does have some noteworthy alliance presence - its just not really utilized.
---
All about context
---
If you have a bunch of marshall's in your guild 7 doesn't mean much.
---
That's why I used a relative concept like 1/50 hk's. If there is a huge gap there, the one who pvps would always get prio. The closer that gap the more the argument closes. And obviously being a warrior vs paladin over a 2h gonna give warrior some weight all other things being equal. 
---
But I would say yea 10 commander and up you have to auto get respect even in a guild where you have 12 plus grand marshalls. People got work/school/kids whatever you don't have to no life pvp to get pvp loot in a PvE guild. But you do have to play a good amount. 
---
Now depending on the pops of these servers 10 may be a less or more impressive feat than i imagine. So hard to tell. On a server with 12k pop 10 was pretty high. Depending on how your classic server works out it may be a more or less time intensive feat.
---
If you're out there using it as a warrior, yea you get prio. 1/50th my hk's you ain't using it and i'm getting it

**Faction:** Alliance
---
**Region:** EU - English Speaking
---
**Server Type:** PVP
---
**Guild Focus:** PVE
---
**About Us:**  E X I L E is a guild formed from a group of friends, most of which have  played wow hardcore since Vanilla and are currently raiding in the top  100 on retail, we will aim to clear all bosses prior to the next phase  of content. All of us are extremely active on Discord be it by playing  WoW together or even other games. We have also met IRL multiple times  over our years playing together which has created a strong connection  and we hope to extend this community we have going forward into Classic  WoW.
---
**Raid Times:**  As most of us wish to keep raiding on retail in our hardcore guilds we  will raid different days from the norm to accommodate this.  Friday/Tuesday CET - 20:00-00:00 (We may add a Saturday night during the  first 1 or 2 weeks of progress if there is enough interest)
---
**Loot Rules:** We will most likely use EPGP loot distribution with additional priority for important roles such as Main Tank etc.
---
**Recruitment:**  We are currently looking for any players who wish to experience all  content that Vanilla WoW has to offer at a more relaxed pace to allow  IRL time or time for other games. Socials are also welcome to join our  community and have fun in dungeons, pvp and other games with us.

---
We  do not care if you are a veteran at Classic wow or if this would be  your first time, we simply ask that you are serious about playing in  Classic WoW and our community.
---
**Communication.**  You must must be able to communicate effectively in English in game and  over voice com. You must therefore have a decent microphone/headset. We  use Discord as our VOIP.
---
**Dedication.**  We don’t have any insane crazy requirements, we simply ask that you  prepare the basics for your character including consumables and enchants
---
**Attitude**.  If you are a total asshole, then this probably isn’t the place for you,  we aim to continue and extend our current atmosphere and friendship  group.
---
**Attendance.** Near 100% attendance should be mandatory for all raiders especially since we will only be raiding 2 days.
---
**Connection**.  We expect that you will have a reliable internet connection, we know  this is vanilla but that doesn’t mean you should be playing on a dial up  connection from 2004! :P
---
A home and community which you are encouraged to be a part of both outside and inside of raids.
---
A well formed community between players allowing for you to find something to do even on empty days of the week.

Ah damn, I was gonna play a private server to get the itch of WoW since I’m not liking retail atm but I’m staying away from private servers.

Noggenfogger elixir, can't wait.
---
62 i believe
---
I don't think this is that accurate. My personal calculations put me at 3-4 weeks and this put me at 2 months.
---
was watchign this and see , not a single cast is missing from the casters. is this how it should be on 30 vs lvl62 boss? or is there just no animation missing a mob as it normally was

dear diary, it's day 5 and im still trying to get the last boar for this quest

When u go north of Eastern plagelands you will find an unfinished passage. In TBC this connects this zone with blood elf initial quests zone.

He is level 62 elite, he is part of the onyxia attunement quest chain and he went down fast by a raid of level 30s
---
I was fancying resto shammy but from my limited private server experience the playstyle wasn't really worth the gear grind. So dps it is then. Seems it boils down to warlock / mage or a rogue (never had one, maybe it's finally time). Gonna have to look em up a bit. Thanks!
---
Before gnomes were announced there were rumors that High/Blood Elves would be the final Alliance race. 
---
They likely considered it (also supported by the high elves present in game being friendly to the alliance). 
---
Keep in mind that WC3 and WoW were being developed concurrently. When WoW development started, they weren't sure if the Scourge would be a playable faction, or a group of npc enemies. The Forsaken storyline was actually added to TFT after they decided upon an undead faction for the Horde in order to justify the existence of said faction:
---
" 
---
I don't recall the Night Elves being considered for Horde, but I can't say for certain this isn't true.
---
As for the Forsaken. Well.
---
Early on, the Horde was definitely considered the "evil" faction. The Forsaken were going to be the undead player race (they weren't called Forsaken yet). Possibly even part of the Scourge. Metzen was still writing WCIII at the time and nothing was solid yet. Once WCIII was done it was obvious that players couldn't be Scourge, what with being minions of the Lich King and all. But they were still totally evil. Obviously.
---
But then, there was the epiphany that some people were into playing evil races/factions. Whereas a LOT more people wanted to play as these "evil races" (Forsaken not included) but as the good guys (Thrall's Orcs during WCIII).
---
So, Metzen needed to come up with something for the undead. We seriously considered dropping them, but every time we looked at concepts/in game assets we balked. Then he announced the Forsaken.
---
And there was much rejoicing. =)"

I recommend checking out John Staats' book *The World of Warcraft Diary*, which chronicles the development process of Vanilla. He also did a ton of AMAs and other interviews leading up to the book's release in which he dropped a ton of information regarding development (including the Forsaken thing I mentioned above):

Great reply, thanks for the input!
---
eyy keep on blowing things out of proportion.
---
you're seriously sucking at reading comprehension right now,
---
Wednesday 29th is another stress test, maybe you get an invite.
---
The invites for the closed beta is kinda over. Only very few people get invited to it.
---
I remember TBC actually being quite a decent journey feeling. It didn't take as long as 1-60 by any means but I definitely recall that sensation of setting my hearthstone in new places as I arrived, the sense that I was far from home and deep into a zone for days on end. The dungeons were legitimately hard and the item upgrades were really important to get. You still had Vanilla style killing efficiency where getting an add or two could mean having to run, and the mob camps were pretty dangerous.
---
I'd bet you if they just made Outland leveling take 4x longer and span 40 levels instead of 10, it would have felt very much like Vanilla.
---
They'd have to adjust a few more things like making the dungeons a bit longer and more sprawly with bigger loot tables, and maybe add another wing or two to each of them. Would need more quests of course to fill in the time and maybe some more of those old school style inter-zone quests that send you around a bunch.
---
Oh, and kill flying.
---
Are you farming the humanoids at the pumpkin patch or the humanoid soldiers near the patch?
---
At what level do you have 60 cloth? I thought you'd rather try to craft the wand in the 5-7 level range and not wait until level 10
---
2 raids.
---
I'm sorry but this is very, very innacurate. For example, 7 hours a day, normal Warrior leveling speed says 2 months while in reality it's about 2 weeks. This is just off on pretty much every calculation except for speedleveling.
---
A good portion of your vanilla XP comes from grinding. To pull off a 3 man leveling group you would have to have perfect mob density, which won't happen in contested zones. That and everyone has to chain pull. 
---
Yeah, you'll be able to do kill 20xyz 3x faster at ~1/3 the XP from mobs, forcing you into a corner with future quest and zone requirements.
---
Looks like swiftys old setup to me  [https://imgur.com/a/hgmTjEb](https://imgur.com/a/hgmTjEb)
---
There are going for Teremus, but it doesn't look like they know the boss is healing for the damage he does. So more people they bring more he will heal.
---
Honestly, I'd wait for someone else to chime in with more current classic experience, as I'm speaking more from a current retail perspective.
---
Perhaps it would be less for phase 1 with it being as easy as it is. I'm not really sure how fast the middling guilds will be clearing early on.
---
It'll definitely get a lot faster later on.
---
Yea sounds like we agree for the most part. I get irked when ppl say things like Ashlhandi bis PvE on hunter -&gt; hunter prio but they arent exactly wrong either
---
Maybe this will work and I'll enjoy it, but it sounds like a long shot :( I'll keep the idea in the back of my mind, but it sounds risky (the risk being me sitting at 60 with a huge gear grind before me, and not much time to enjoy the game). :( I feel so old
---
Agreed, why is this being upvoted
---
rose tinted goggles amirite OP. you think you do but you don't. right brobeans? LMAO. i don't mind if they add LFR and transmog to Classic, QoL brah. right? hahahaha. C R I N G E
---
If enough guilds did this, the mount would have a terrible stigma. It might actually be a great way to solve the "who gets the mount?" dilemma.
---
But Cenarian Hold isn't even on the map. That seems wrong for all patches.
---
It's pretty bad. It dumps on hunters and rogues in pvp, hopefully gets fixed soon.
---
Back during vanilla I played on an active PVP server and I main tanked for one of the larger guilds on the server. Most alts that were leveled took 8+ days in game time (/played) to level. That was for experienced people who generally knew what they were doing and had a leveling plan or some gear ready.
---
It really depends on your class, game knowledge, gear, and if there will pvp or not. I leveling a warrior alone, with average gear, and no previous game knowledge and it took me about 15 days (in game time) to go from 0-60. That includes working on professions, exploring, PVP, and everything in between. I leveled in Jan/Feb of 2006 so I would expect classic wow to be much busier, and much harsher conditions to level in. 
---
A problem you may run into is that if you really intent to raid as a shadowpriest you will not only need a lot of gear but will be fighting mages and warlocks for that gear. You will also be fighting for off pieces of other priests, druids, and anyone crazy enough to try and go boomkin. What you are great at is buffing affliction warlocks damage. So if your guild has an abundance of aff warlocks then that should be great. Don't expect to do top tier damage though. 
---
Personally I would say that guild isn't really that reasonable when it comes it comes to leveling. Unless they are going to have a high amount of cooperative leveling organized and planned out I don't really see why there would be a time requirement for leveling. Going from 0-60 will probably take most people 1 or 2 real world months unless they have a massive amount of time to devote to the game. Also there is gearing up once 60 which relies on a heavy amount of luck to get the drops you need. And then there are professions and grinding for not only your epic mount but all the mats for crafted gear. If raiding is the goal I would expect it to be 2-3 months after release for there to be 50 people ready to really raid MC for all but the really hardcore.
---
Keep your weapon updated, and dont be shy looting "DPS" gear when u lvl. You basicly lvl same as you would deeing dps. You want the best weapon posible for your lvl at all times.
---
But mostly what i found out, that lvling as prot from lvl 10 is SUPER good cuz you learn sooooo much as a tank ! Puling back, patrols, mob abilities, the constant fear "if i pull another this is gonna be bad!". Killing stuff is a bit slower, but it makes you AWARE of your incoming dmg, thret you get from using your abilities (use a thret meter from lvl 1, ignore anyone who say you dont need it) to test whats actualy better, a dagger heroic poke or a nasty shield slam or something. How much thret a shout does etc etc. You will want to interupt every spellcast, becouse you can and its fun to think that mage was trying to say his spell, and you punched him in his teeth so hard he had to stop :D
---
Anyways, i thought i knew how to tank from my TBC days, but the lvling as prot only made me better as a tank.
---
My tank has a "GG!" at end guarantee :)

I wanted to go to Storm wind as a night elf, so I made the dreaded wetlands run to iron forge, then ran to stormwind. yes, I ran to stormwind from iron forge, at lvl 12. I found the tram while exploring the city and literally cried when I realized I was back in iron forge.
---
February 2022 what the fuck.
---
I feel you, considering the level gap and the fact he's elite the chance of hitting a spell on him should be 1 in 50
---
Also im not sure BRE is bad for PvE tbh. Depends on boss armor values but should be strong in early phases at least.
---
Haha, good times... I remember some random player helping out leading me to the trainer in goldshire. If it wasn't for him i wonder how much longer i would have gone without skills xD I think the beta shut down soon after though so i learned just in time for launch!
---
if youre first flare doesnt uncover the rogue who just stealthed a follow up volley can be really handy too
---
There's no real way to prove Blizzards intention. 
---
In Vanilla, most Blood Elves were hostile to everyone, but Blood Elves were exceedingly rare. Off the top of my head, only Lethtendris and that Magister in Azshara come to mind. Maybe Lothos Riftwalker as well? But he was friendly to everyone IIRC. 
---
High Elves were a mixed bag. The lodges and several NPCs were Alliance, Adon was friendly to everyone, that one captain and his friend in the barrens was neutral (Ratchet affiliated IIRC). 
---
And then I think there were a few cult members in Scholomance. With how rare they were in Vanilla, it's probably possible to list all of them and their affiliations without it becoming an overly long list, but unfortunately there's no filter for the race in the vanilla databases.
---
I honestly can‘t remember it. Like I have never seen it before :o maybe it‘s because I only played alliance
---
Where are you grinding cloth?
---
I don't have beta access but I am interested in the difference between straight up going to the pumpkin patch and grinding out cloth and rushing the wand or just simply questing and just crafting the wand when you eventually get enough cloth. 
---
Have you tested both those routes? Which is faster?
---
I think you missed the point of my reply. I suggested arms and fury in the beginner levels because you will get the most bang for your buck by rushing imp. HS and imp. Overpower. This is for the DPS increase to make his life not suck while questing.
---
I agree with you on all the points you made. All I did was suggest that he fill out the 31 points into protection from levels 30-60.
---
You don't need defiance in in level 25 dungeons.
---
Man this takes me back, so glad hobbs got in, i think most people who played vanilla saw some of this og paladin videos
---
Go play retail. Or Super Mario
---
Not enough talk about tendies or Sue Bae.
---
I’ve put 800 hours into Civ 5.
---
It’s alright; worth a play or two lol
---
Depends on which content / how geared people are. Hunters can easily top meters all the way up to Naxx until casters / warriors can stack 14%ish hit.
---
Before theyre hit capped its easy for hunters to beat them
---
I'm having a hard time figuring out how to use this program to use these as a background, can you help me out?
---
If you compare BiS between the classes, Mages actually are one of the more cohesive looking classes, second only to Rogues (and Prot warriors) imo. 
---
All comes down to preference I guess.
---
You also get a spot in every dungeon run from 15-60. I straight up get messaged twice a day asking to tank stuff. I’m not even specced correctly.
---
Another important note is that server populations are definitely going to be smaller than private servers so gathering materials will be heavily limited so I imagine open world grinding + two gathering professions is going to give the highest gp/h unless you're a premium dungeon grinding class.
---
Ranked BGs and arenas, sure. Like you said.
---
But it applies to unranked BGs and even outdoor world as well. Which is sad.
---
Yeah that was my hope, but without being able to predict server populations and content difficulty it's a risky choice nevertheless. I'll definitely keep it in mind, I did more research today and the consensus was that warriors are the hardest to gear up. :(
---
A raid and a half. Jimmyhere had a second group of about 16 people as well. Still super fun to watch
---
typical baddie
---
Named my Undead MALE Rogue Sylvanaz....
---
Pretty sure i googled WoW lore and thought oh that name is cool... Changed the S to a Z and that was that... Until i finally met the real Sylvanas.... Didnt re-roll and played him all the way up to Chromaggus when I finally stopped playing.
---
oh wow how long it took them? i missed it
---
I played a hunter and while leveling to sixty, I disregarded all stats besides armor.
---
50 days /played, dayum! Wonder how many hours more she could squeeze out of the end game!
---
i cant wait until classic raiding so i can show you guys some parses
---
Tangentially related: My buddy didn't realize he could change classes in final fantasy tactics until about halfway through. He just had a team of maxed out squires.
---
Blizzard said sharding. Changed their mind. Blizzard said 4 phases. Changed their mind. Blizzard said loot trading all BOP dungeon items. Changed their mind.  
---
Clearly no means no.
---
Do you need to keep training new pets to learn higher ranks of a skill? Like if I learned Bite 1 from one of my pets will I have to train a different pet to teach it a higher rank of Bite?
---
If so it seems like hunters will have to train a lot of pets to learn all the ranks of a skill, so do hunters typically leave a pet slot open to keep cycling out pets? Thanks for the answer.
---
Seems pretty accurate to me, if average /played time is 10 days to 60 then 240 hours it will take, 70 hours in 3 weeks is a total of 240 give it take a few hours depending on how fast you go
---
For some reason it won’t load on mobile google drive app- will test on computer when I get home
---
Raiding doesn't really require you to dedicate a monster amount of time, it just requires you to dedicate a consistent amount of time every week.
---
The 20% chance at a rez Darkmoon card was also hilarious in arena. It didn't always work, but when it did... Sucks that they nerfed it for higher levels midway through wotlk.
---
It’s not. Lvl as dps and keep int gear.
---
Hahaha
---
This is a lot of sport and not that much sleep. If you can do it with only 4,5 hours of sleep wow! Have my respect! I need at least 8 hours of it
---
retard
---
I thought this as well while I was watching.
---
All you can do is report the bug.
---
The problem with this is if your in BRD then you should do attunement to onyxia and that is a 16 part epic. I spent a weekend (literally like 30 hours) with my guild getting about 10 members attuned to both MC and onyxia.
---
From roughly level 40 to 60, I leveled by grinding. I thought it would be faster. By the time I hit level 60 I had 17 days played.
---
This hurts to read
---
I loved STM as horde, not because I rate it particularly high relative to other zones but mostly because I hate Barrens so much that getting a break in STM feels like holiday. I prefer Alliance 10-30 over Horde for sure, Westfall, Redridge, Duskwood, Loch Modan and Darkshore are all among my favourite zones.
---
WHY DO NONE OF THESE BOARS HAVE LIVERS!? THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC!
---
Exactly. My favorite mage sets are "kinda cool" at best, and even then they pale in comparison to other class sets of the same tier every time.
---
What is your friend going to play? Will you level together?
---
All of those are very big impact decisions. There isn't a single person on this subreddit that says "add these mounts in or I'm not subscribing".
---
Lmao it was funny and well made but seriously lacking believability and dramatic curve not including any setbacks or losses on their side. 
---
Inbefore someone says they never lose. I've seen enough streams, vids, etc to catch their humbling moments.
---
Agreed, but defiance in a 25 dungeon is the differance betwean "hes ok" and "that was fucking amazing! He was AE tanking 7 mobs like a baws ! I thought vanilla was hard...." :D :D 
---
I agree, having your 1st 6 talents spent in a prot tree you cant realy use at lvl 17, feels a bit wierd. But after you do WC, you will know you did the right thing :)
---
Lvling as prot is not for everyone, i mostly did it to learn new stuff i forgot from TBC. Lvling as dps and beeing able to tank is more than doable. If people actualy wait for 2 sunders :D
---
That would be a rational argument to not give an hpala or warrior ashkandi
---
mentioning you want it cuz you show up...but don't pvp. No. Saying it's your BiS in PvE for your main spec.....Fair
---
When people try to take my Malistar's for their warriors for PvE off tank. THEN WE'RE FIGHTING GET FUCKED 
---
That will be one of my biggest questions to guilds lol, "i get first malistar's right?"
---
I've only met one guild who ever did that, and bless his soul the guy i was talking to warned me cuz i was talking about pvp gear. Told me all their warriors had prio on it for the armor on the shield. They had over a dozen of em....Noped the fuck on outta there
---
On Alliance it's bad for PvE. Or at least was on Pservers. As to whether or not it will be bad in classic we shall see. 
---
Alliance BRE was not good on p servers....It was nice to have the debuff but who was gonna sign up to do that when you did more with dal rends/
---
Your old pet that you got from level 10-12 can learn all the new ranks of skills, but in order to teach them to your pet, you have to first tame a new pet that has the ability and use it a couple of times. 
---
So you have to stable your old pet a couple of times, but you can use the same pet all the way from 10 to 60.
---
Watching right now, you're right, they are screwed
---
A few in the group are playing warriors and I’m sure others will be dps classes
---
It's much slower. You can heal perfectly fine while leveling as a dps spec; you can't dps well at all as a healing spec.
---
Original plans for vanilla were like 100 quests for every faction. Think about how much times this would have costed 😂
---
asmon is in process of realizing this right now lol
---
All of those are differences in their operation and the way that they fly. But the basic purpose they serve is the same: to transport objects and people from one location to another through the medium of flight.
---
It’s painful to watch.  They don’t tank...the dragon just chases the highest DPS (hunter) and he kites while Asmon yells things as if he’s “leading”
---
&gt;rose tinted goggles amirite OP. you think you do but you don't. right brobeans? LMAO. i don't mind if they add LFR and transmog to Classic, QoL brah. right? hahahaha. C R I N G E
---
kinda sad to see how offended one person can be through a harmless meme. are u alright mate?
---
Played a NE holy priest from 1-60.  Never grouped (until raids). Always used the keyboard to turn.  Never used downranked spells.  Never used wand attack, only staff attack.  Only used gear with +intellect and never +healing.
---
It doesn’t get much worse than me in Vanilla.
---
I plan to redeem myself in a few months :)
---
Add these mounts in or I'm not subscribing.  
---
Me typing those words holds just about as much weight as anyone typing these words. They're meaningless.
---
You don't level in healing specs if you value your sanity. You can still dungeon heal all the way up to 58 or so before respeccing. When you hit 60 then you would choose if you want to dps or heal. Then switch spec.
---
THe death runs are miserable
---
Couldn't care less, someone like you will never be good enough to play with or vs people like me. You need a robust mindset to grind through all the retards who trashtalk but are not that great, and then be able to take the heat when people lose it in close games.
---
Classic doesn't really attract me, it won't be close to 1.12 pvp mechanically and dead in a few months anyway. I already play 1.12 and 3.3.5 pvp a lot we never went anywhere, it's just that people who played a game where you can get titles for free are mixed with people who never went on after wotlk.
---
This isn't the game for you. Move along
---
just watch a video of the male tauren feign death animation and you will be 100% convinced
---
you can also find multiple bfa related strings and objects in the binary:

i doubt these were present during legion.

i can solo this boss as a lvl 20 lvl hunter. Just bring it to Bolvar ffs...
---
People like you are the reason retail sucks.
---
0/10.  Classic wow is a RPG. Players just can't magically teleport whereever they want to go. If you don't want to maybe classis wow isn't the game for you.
---
World first? I killed him 10 years ago
---
Oh no. It's retarded.
---
&gt; Add these mounts in or I'm not subscribing.
---
Mission accomplished! You won't be missed.
---
I donno man I've tanked a ton at low levels and no one pulls off of me if I don't want them to. You should be starting every pull with a good amount of rage pooled. 1 sunder+1 heroic strike is enough to pull so far ahead of everyone else that you can just auto attack untill it's dead
---
I used to hit the auto attack button and sinister strike at the same time, I didn't understand that auto attack was automatic
---
WoW completely shat over all Warcraft lore, so no reason to take anything that happened post WC3 as cannon.
---
so are finding new group with non assholes
---
i was human and have only done it once so far.  i didnt straight grind cloth but i killed a bunch of extra gnolls/defias while doing quests; defias in westfall drop a shitload of linen it's actually ridiculous.  i was struggling to even get enough for lesser magic wand but once i got to westfall it went really fast.  getting to 11-12 and grinding the defias in the mine in northern westfall would probably get you enough to get the wand by 13 honestly, but that doesn't help horde side lol.
---
R.I.P Wrexstriss and Felstorm
---
I rolled a mage.  Only used instant cast spells and tried to be a battle mage 😂🤣😂.
---
in my head that shit was way better
---
&gt; leather is BiS for Warrior until raid 
---
He said that above 2 posts above
---
in my test i don't farm any particular humanoids. but the questing route includes scarlets from 3 different locations, the undead at the mills, the zombies that drop putrid claws, the gnolls, the ghosts SE of the lake, and the zombies in the middle of the lake.
---
all of these drop cloth!
---
Wb’s are dire maul buffs, Ony, ZG, and songflower
---
This is really bad and not the first example
---
That warrior quest chain where you have to kill the flying things was so fucking tedious hahaha
---
I've never played Warrior, does it not get picked up at class trainers?
---
y my PPPPPP hard?
---
But....your class trainer literally gave you the quest.....lol
---
&gt; Jesus christ just drop it already.
---
Read the title of this post and stop being needlessly enraged.
---
For real, have you ever had to take care of a horse with no teeth? They can’t chew grass, which means they’re basically fucked.
---
One of my best friends growing up had a 30ish year old horse that had been in the family longer than him or his brother. This poor old fucker had to eat an oatmeal mush thing that took extra time to prepare, and the horse wasn’t always exactly excited about eating it. He did have some pretty dope slow-mo rollovers though.
---
I went with the arcanite sword instead of the reaper. I know how you feel.
---
Yeah i know, but i wonder how far and serious were the intentions to add let, let alone the belves/helves as a playable race.
---
Holy priest (with spirit tap) is ok. Rest are all terrible.
---
One needs no motivation other than the World of Roguecraft videos to play a vanilla rogue, my friend.
---
A naked rogue using a starting dagger killing people wearing epics? The stuff of legend.
---
They're on the WarcraftMovies site. The ones uploaded on YouTube don't lag nearly as much but the awesome music selections got removed...
---
Imagine a world where buying a mastercrafted weapon that was pryed from the cold dead hands of an immortal deity can be purchased for cheaper then learning how to ride a horse.
---
2019 Classic makes endgame PvP more exciting as people are actually good at the game and do sick plays, but it makes PvE and leveling less of a fufilling experience as it isn't as difficult whenever you have all the knowledge, IMO.
---
zzzz z z zz z zz z zzz
---
Yeah but im talking about vanilla times.
---
I wouldn't roll a rogue as my first class since it'll be impossible to get into a good guild
---
Every top end guild did this in vanilla. Content did not get passed in vanilla, top guilds cleared every raid every week for Thunderyfury, BiS drops that were used even into TBC, etc. Guild got gold for the drops, gold was used on consumes. There were a ton of servers that finished the AQ war effort via raid lotteries. You send in mats for the war effort, you get a chance at being brought to a raid to loot whatever you want. Realm forums were full of posts selling raid runs. Behavior was ubiquitous.
---
Everyone in this sub: Your opinion is wrong.
---
I agree, I like the water. Wish there was an option for newer graphics/animations for classic.
---
I missed the way the game was played in the past, but not the graphics.
---
Ya at this point, as cool as it is, is ruining all of our chances at experiencing these moments. By the time we get on in August it will be a grind to 60 and these raids will be tedious and short-lived. Genuinly pissed about it.
---
Haha yeah I did tons of stupid mistakes in the beginning as well.On my first character on the beta I played Warlock and only used Shadow Bolt and wondered why I was so weak.
---
How about you find some friends/a guild instead of just walking there randomly in the hope that you might get a group?
---
Pah, you obviously need glasses bro! ;D
---
it's terrible the runbacks from deaths are one of the worst for a lower level zone. if u die at the peak GGWP
---
Agreed, all i'm saing is its easier as prot, not a must, just much easier :)
---
Also can anyone confirm the  character customisation options thing?
---
Cuz the old blood/high elf models were quite underdeveloped, and iirc they just had one male and female version.
---
It's literally the exact same tech. The bugs that popped up during the beta and stress test confirmed that. They took sharding, and introduced some limitations to reduce the community-breaking aspects. But it's still a *form* of sharding, that's not really debatable.
---
nah vanilla desolace is my favorite zone of all time. i literally cannot wait to quest back there again
---
BFA is there for you to play this exact way bud
---
I actually like T2 and T3. It’s hard to say Netherwind is in my top 5 for T2 because Blizzard knocked that tier out of the park. Burning Crusade mages, though, have some of the coolest sets. Those tempest shoulders... hngggg...
---
holy shit people really need to stop circlejerking about how darker the nights were in classic.
---
retail already fixed the night time but people still think it used to be darker??
---
Who is he? :D
---
If only you were Alliance :/
---
Not exactly something I hope they fix.
---
This is simply not true.
---
Balanced != homogenized.
---
It was the "plan" all along. Just listen to Kevin Jordan (original class designer) what the purpose was - *every* spec to be viable in all parts of the game.
---
And look at TBC. The classes were fun, had identity and they were much more balanced.
---
Too many shower beers huh?
---
As someone else said, priest is okay, the rest are far faster questing with dps specc
---
Anything above 3 thousand is just an absolute nightmare, and even then that is pushing it.
---
Yeah for sure. It's just a question of what you want to sacrifice when you aren't tanking.
---
Questing with virtually no DPS abilities can be pretty frustrating
---
End game warrior PvP best in slot can be mix/matched from HighWalord/NAXX/AQ gear which the focus being HP for endurance STR for damage CRIT for DAMAGE
---
World buffs. 
---
Raiding revolve around these buffs, it trivializes the content and force players to stay logged out of their main chars for ages and ages if you want to stack these coveted buffs. Most raids won't take you if you don't have them. Putting 12hr cooldown on Nef/Ony head? LOL, it will only force people to log out even more. It's even worse when there's Darkmoon Faire up with a 10% roulette dmg increase. Want 2x DMF for raids? Oh, your speedclear didn't go as planned? Better get fresh DMF and then log out for a week.
---
People keep saying they won't be a problem because timers, but I can't do anything but lol at that. Just means you have to sit on them even longer.
---
Get rid of the stacking worldbuffs I say. It's aids.
---
Was okay I guess, a few minutes
---
More likely closer to .02% beta and 2% or less stress.
---
There are 100k+ subs on this forum alone which itself is not representative of the whole classic community.
---
i like payo a lot
---
I'd be okay with features I was begging for DURING Vanilla.
---
AOE loot. 
---
Summoning Stones as they worked in the TBC pre-patch. 
---
Mounts/Pets learned as spells and not taking up bag space. 
---
Equipment sets being built in and not requiring a mod.
---
Things like that. 
---
What made classic...classic..was how the classes played, it was the content, running the dungeons,the farming, and it was the people. It wasn't the bugs or the quirks or the lack of QoL. (besides, they added a ton of QoL over the life of vanilla, so they were definitely aware that the game needed improvement)
---
You'll never convince me that most of those above things will somehow 'ruin' classic.
---
Was a prominent paladin player back in vanilla. Made some YouTube videos of him pulling mobs in dungeons
---
that zimmer music lmfao. The Last Streamurai
---
Do you per chance have the Atlas available too? For the maps of rare mobs. Been looking for one for weeks. Should probably just order one from somewhere but you know...
---
Malistar's really isn't worth prioing to tanks. But we did give it to one tank who had terrible luck getting UBRS shield. Pallys didnt mention being upset.... but I didnt know it was so coveted for them. This was once other raids were out..... is that shield from BWL better? I think its called like Red Dragonscale or something
---
I'm obsessed with undead but my warrior should be an orc or tauren. It's hard for me to decide but I'm pretty set on still choosing undead because of how they speak to me.
---
Tfw you are still in the raid group you joined for Hogger.
---
Cool story bro
---
Prot in Wrath.  You could use healing gear and that talent they had that gave back mana on crits to single heal for a long time.  It was actually possible in TBC to some extent, but Wrath really made it obvious.
---
I think you're thinking of the Cataclysm version of the zone. This post is about the vanilla version of the zone.
---
There are several ways you could go about it, since Wallpaper Engine is integrated into the Steam Workshop. You can "subscribe" to a particular wallpaper directly from the link in this reddit post if you're logged in to Steam from the same account that you bought Wallpaper Engine with, and the wallpapers will eventually show up in the program. You could also look up my steam profile and look through my workshop items and subscribe to them there. If all else fails, you can search for them through Wallpaper Engine directly by searching for terms like, "WoW"
---
Are u stating i should focus on capping to 60 then come back to sm and start my sm pick pocket runs and so forth to the next spot? Or take time out of my leveling  and farm pick pockrtting at lv 40 till i hit pickpocket lv 80-170 then go back to leveling?
---
The "BFA Bad, upvotes do the left" circlejerk has becoming self-aware!
---
I’d hear you out if your first recommendation wasn’t antithetical to Classic. What is it you want out of Classic if you can’t be assed to walk to the dungeons? And you’re probably the person to quit after one wipe, and blame it on having a wife and kids. Don’t commit to things you don’t have time for at the moment.
---
Personally, it annoyed me after a while. For example, by WotLK it was SO annoying pushing for the Deathbringer (the one that transformed you, not sure if that’s the correct name) trinket while also pushing for rating to buy the weapons and sets lol. I think it’s because both aspects were black and white while as in Vanilla they were sort of grey? 
---
For some reason I’m actually looking forward to it, since PvE gear is way more effective than PvE stuff in later expansions ;)
---
Everyone’s “world first” is getting old..
---
Why are they hard to gear?  Aren't they the only ones that wear caster mail, so no competition?
---
Was so much fun watching him get WW axe, he was the top streamer on the wow section during it and the private server pvp guys ganking him then letting them kill Cyclonian in the end was a nice twist.
---
this is what the game was back then.  think of it as a window into the past.  if you don't want to play it that's ok.  The real WoW with all the expansions that we've all had access to for 15 years is still there and it has tons of improvements over this, they changed stuff for real reasons, it's true.  Classic is all about nostalgia and "remember when we had to do this" type stuff, it was never a good choice of game for people with a job and 3 kids back then and it isn't now.
---
sperging out lol
---
yes it does? The bottom part of "eastern kingdoms" used to be called azeroth

This is actually really good stuff. I know a lot of people have written and talked about what they like about vanilla and how 'modern' has lost it's way over the years "LOL BFA SUX, WELFARE EPIX" etc but it's refreshing to hear someone talk intelligently and coherently about the issues.  
---
I think many BFA players will be in a similar boat to Preach, where they think Classic is kinda silly, and they think they like what modern WoW has become over the last decade, and it's not until they actually play Classic and see what a real MMO world looks and feels like that they'll realise what  they've lost in modern.
---
*mage potentially swole
---
Fyfy
---
I somewhat agree with this, you can ignore some of the stuff hes saying but the general gameplay still stays the same.
---
Things like this make me wonder. We know Blizz has the 1.12 reference... yet this didn’t seem to make it over. So could there be some proof in the pudding here for mitigation or avoidance not being entirely 100%, or perhaps based on 2.3 values?
---
no thanks
---
no need to needlessly start shit, to each their own.
---
Like ripe cantaloupe
---
Definitely one of the more annoying streamers out there
---
he also is one of the few 30s with AGM which makes him god tier
---
Jokes on you - more damage taken = more rage generated = more threat generation
---
That warrior is next level tactics; he knows how to do his job
---
How would u effectively level rogue at a fast rate?
---
Stop, I can only get so erect
---
Nah Blizzard said everything is working as intended! /s
---
All this time I thought Azeroth was the entire planet...
---
Do you even Horde, bro?
---
Its a boe, they all should need or make a rule at the beginning to greed.
---
Streamer shaming 101 here ^^
---
I actually have a lot of memories here. Reaching STM showed that you had made some good progress with your character as you slowly make your way up to the peak. It's just such a varied zone and I remember it being really tricky and dangerous. 
---
Really looking forward to visiting it again
---
Was thinking the same but at level 20. I did the running as my level 5 char on the stresstest and it was little over an hour running. At level 20 you wont die so many times so it will be faster. Assuming you only do the minimum things in dungeons i think they could take 20 min each. All in all, shouldn't take more than 2-2,5 hours.
---
I thought layering was only going to be used for the first few starting zones?
---
Got spot for rogue? I really just want a guranteed income outside of camping devilsaurs.. mining nodes..etc.. like how hunters can just farm mara all day
---
Wtf are you talking about T3 is easley one of the worst
---
Enough to know that the healers and mages have priority for mana over classes that already do incredible dps
---
I’m not sure if this has been mentioned in this post, but flight paths don’t tilt. Here’s the post: https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsty57/flight_paths_are_very_very_bad_in_the_beta_heres/
---
Soooo much running. And then the elite quests deep in the Night Elf tunnel are just not worth it.
---
You have to realize that most of these streamers were invited to increase the hype for the game, not for their own bug testing efforts. Keep trucking along, they take every report seriously whether you believe they do or do not. Your concerns will be met with changes or with no changes but I guarantee you that your concern will be logged and will be noted.
---
Hobbs is an avid Hearthstone streamer right now, hope he plans on playing classic!
---
Lul no
---
Mini preparation for Hunters?  
---
Preparation-H?
---
Play BFA

Good

The less false bug reports the devs need to sort through, the more time they’ll have to spend actually researching and foxing the bugs they do know about
---
Plus, most people report things that aren’t even bugs to begin with; “this boss does too much damage”
---
increase attack speed

Definitely 2019 Classic. I had no idea what I was doing when I started in 2006. Learning and exploring was fun, but I plan to be more of a tour guide this time, making my own leveling guild and helping out players who are new to Classic and WoW in general.
---
Retail is --&gt; that way.
---
I do hope so. That's definitely not all of them and I'm not focusing on the streamers, but considering the restricted access, I hoped people would take this more seriously...
---
You serious?
---
private servers lmao
---
I got the email on the 21st, if you need a time frame of when to look.  It'll also be a [choice in the blizzard launcher](http://puu.sh/Dy0Ap/ee576b8097.png) if you get in!
---
You sound like a child.  Asking for a game creator to make a game easier for you is ridiculous.  It is THEIR GAME, not yours
---
Its been a bit of a surprise hearing so many WoW personalities kind of do a 180 on Classic. They thought they wouldn’t but they did I guess. Ventuki, Taliesen, JesseCox, Preach, and more I’m forgetting. That’s cool, but that makes me worry the hype for Classic will be *way* higher than Blizzard thinks, and populations end up grossly mismanaged.
---
You want a sense of community. 
---
With too many people, you'll never see the same people and it gets stale.
---
I remembered certain horde players, and I'm sure they remembered me. Certain players I would avoid, because you just knew he was OP.
---
Yeah except that example is precisely from a streamer who knew nothing about that. That's what I'm annoyed by. Lots of people who truly care got left out to watch people have fun.
---
Yes you could enslave in 1.x 
---
I remember our locks having field days there.  The imps was really op.
---
Depends on the class and what you mean by "healing spec."  
---
Priest is probably most able as long as you pick up 5/5 Spirit Tap and 5/5 Wand Spec.  You can basically open with Holy Fire, then SWP, then shield and wand until the enemy dies.  Spiritual guidance is pretty good for leveling with spirit tap but you don't get it until later.  (lvl 44).  
---
Shaman is probably next, because 3% hit and spell hit is really nice for leveling, and 25% cheaper totems can help with downtime while leveling.  Since you're 90% of the time just be doing something like: stoneskin totem -&gt; Lightning Bolt -&gt; Flame Shock -&gt; Melee with flametongue weapon etc. 
---
Druid can be somewhat OK since you don't get a lot of killing power from points in the feral tree until Predatory Strikes and cat form is pretty effective baseline. 
---
Paladin is probably the worst, though that's partially because paladin leveling just kind of sucks in the first place.
---
Bolvar on private server is bugged and dunnot aggro him. It seems this version of Classic is bugged aswell.
---
more like everyone in Stormwind is screwed lol
---
they kited the boss there instead.
---
Get outta here troll
---
I spent hours grinding mats to craft 2 [Phantom Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7961/phantom-blade) to level my *Arms Warrior*.
---
I used them, and this spec, all the way to 60.
---
More on horde than alliance however
---
That's sharding, which might be in the game on top of layering, which is a separate system of mini-servers basically. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
You’re such a hero!
---
It's gonna suck having a full-time job for this launch of vanilla. Especially one where my shift changes day to day...how am I supposed to raid like that?!?!
---
if you want a game full of QoL stuff where you dont have to have 10 hours a day to play because you have a job and 3 kids, play retail or a different game. dont suggest to ruin the game that everyone else wants just because it doesnt work for you. stop being so fucking selfish.
---
Also, game is three months away, hype could literally wait until like in a month, there's a lot to fix
---
Level as dps, you can heal perfectly fine in dungeons while in dps spec and questing won't take you an eternity.
---
&gt;Nah this was one of, if not the best revamped zones in cata. 
---
ab.so.lutely. not.
---
I don't like the cata style of being go-karted around a zone. I don't like following a story directly. I don't like being someone in command unless I did the grand Marshall grind. (Which means that I'm never someone in command and that's okay by me because I don't deserve it.)
---
Im so looking forward to vanilla levelling. I've missed it so damn much. I just want to sit down and grind it out like I used to. Music, podcasts, heavy metal and the constant fear of shitting myself in a world that's bigger and better than I am.
---
Fuck the story telling, I always find it annoying. Give me my damn adventure back and stop holding my fucking hand.
---
Spellcasts resisted, they didn’t miss. So it should be working as intended right?
---
Don’t spellcasts resist, not miss?
---
Yup it is all keywords in chat. My dad still raids in EQ too this day.
---
For sure man, I know you aren't trying to attack them, and I feel everyone should do there best to help bring a more "vanilla experience" across the board. I am glad that they have a lot of high profile streamers on the beta test to increase the levels of "hype" for the game though. A lot of friends AND a lot of streamers that I personally know have had very increased interest in coming back to classic after being pretty adamant about not wanting to play it.  What is more important than every bug or QoL feature is having an actual player base to play with in the end. I think most of us are looking for the community back in the game more so than the game play.
---
You should be able to go without buying weapons on a warrior other than the one you might buy for level 6. There’s a pretty good progression for alliance warriors at least. It’s worth to figure out the order of weapons for your warrior ahead of time to make it less painful to level.
---
It should only cost 90g to buy riding and mount due to reputation discount. 
---
It’s a good idea to send the materials to level your intended profession to an alt whenever you get the chance. Then you can send them back after you get your mount. You could take mining/skinning at first to get leather to vendor for extra gold and send the ore and stuff to the alt. Then unlearn skinning once you are ready to level engineering.
---
What guide?
---
To be fair this is the only way to pvp as ret. the skill ceiling is way to high for just a normal computer
---
Really? You didn't know OP was for "Overpowered" when referencing items and if they'd be in nerfed state....?
---
If you refuse to dismiss your pet and cause a wipe because of it, you don't have to look far to find the asshole in your group. People aren't obnoxious about this because they want to annoy you specifically, but because they've seen it happen a dozen times and want to save everyone the headache.
---
Why can't we just have servers where whoever is on that server shows up on that server?
---
um this isnt athene
---
Holy priest is actually quite good, especially with the shadow regen talent. All the others classes, though, would be a miserable leveling experience.
---
Isn’t warlock garbage until tier 2/3?
---
You don't even say what the bug is, probably because it's not even a bug. You sound like a loser.
---
With Teremus. Good way to lower the population.
---
Do it in Classic!
---
You’re probably a terrible parent too
---
Bug is flight path's animations are incorrect :) 100% verified bug no one talks about, but okay buddy :)
---
i’m need rolling need on this for DE mats i have a family
---
Welcome to Toxic!
---
We are a North America based guild playing on Alliance. We will roll on a PVP server when they announced names.​
---
We are a semi-hardcore (we will lean more hardcore towards the start) U.S. raiding guild and have been playing together since April of 2015. We have raided mainly Vanilla content, but have delved into TBC and WOTLK as well. We run a 9 Hour raid week. Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Mondays are the focus of our main group. Before enough content is available, or enough alts to do more than one raid, raid times will be used for focus farming or remaining dungeon gearing. We look forward to having a stronger PVP presence in Classic compared to our Past. We look at skill, attitude, and gear/dedication to character in that order. We do not carry dead weight or people who clash with the guild.
---
While we take the game and the experience very seriously, we are realistic about our capabilities. The majority of us are in our late 20’s to early 30’s, maintain a full time job, and take care for our families. Wow has been a cornerstone in many of our lives for the past 14 years. While we are always pushing to do the new content, we do not leave our friends behind. The best part of wow that we all cling to over the many years we played is friendship and the relationships we make along the way. We are a gaming community with Wow being the focus of all of us!
---
Here at Toxic, we hope to bring a different type of guild from most. We want to be tight-knit, supportive of each other, not afraid to point our friends to become better; we encourage friendly competition; we look for members going out of their way to assist; we want to be that old school fun guild that doesn't feel like a job, but rather a community of friends who want to kick a little ass! I will put a lot of effort into bringing very popular posts and guides into a central location on our website ([http://toxicgaming.us/](http://toxicgaming.us/)) to allow for your focus to be on the game, rather than trying to research how to best play your class, or where to go to level a profession.
---
Our Leadership:
---
Our leadership has experience leading in all retail walks of life up: from Vanilla up to and including the Draenor expansion. The guild leaders, Pronator &amp; Michaelfox, have been around since the game was first released in 2004. They have experienced all end game raids during their prime.
---
Loot System:
---
Loot Council- The Loot Council will be made up of class ldeaders, and a random rotation of regular raid members. We will do a prioritized loot system where we are distributing the loot in the most fair way possible, based on BIS and class needs. We plan on putting a ton of effort into ensuring the right gear gets in the right players hands. We have always prided ourselves in being completely transparent with all decisions and encourage all to talk through all loot (outside of when we are raiding of course).
---
Main Raid Times:
---
We raid from 10 p.m. till 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (7 p.m. till 10 p.m. PST). Currently, the days we raid are Wednesday , Thursday , and Monday. Raiders are expected to be online an hour or so before raid for raid buffs and to pull on time.
---
We plan on going for every world boss that we can unless it is at an extremely unoptimal time.
---
We plan on doing a secondary raid group on weekends, strong alt characters or members who cannot make the primary raid time will make up the majority of this raid group. We will treat this raid just as serious as the primary raid.
---
Our Goals:
---
Our main goal for the Toxic guild is to progress as far as possible quickly (but enjoying the content as well) and also competing with other fellow guilds for progression.
---
Our Expectations:
---
We expect players to be the best they can be, always! This means you should know your class in and out (doing proper research from credible sources). You should have all the addons, macros, and keybindings your class needs in order to be the best. Don't be a clicker, no one likes a clicker.
---
What about PVP:
---
While &lt;Toxic&gt; is mainly focused on the PVE side of the game, PVP will also be organized and encouraged. There are quite a few BIS or easily obtainable PVP items for PVE raiding. We will be coordinating guild pre-made battlegrounds and other fun events!
---
Why Toxic?:
---
We are unlike any other guild. We take time to try to mold our entire team as a cohesive unit. We have done many super fun RP Events including Halloween in the Crypts of Karazhan, Christmas &amp; New Year's parties. We have celebrated unique birthdays as a guild and many other strange but incredible events. We are all in when we set our minds to something. Our player base in our 40 man bolstered an unprecedented 25+ of our team having a 90%+ lifetime attendance to raids (100+ raids). Don’t ask Why, ask Why not!!!\`
---
Our Current High Recruitment needs are:
---
Warlock, Resto Druid, Dwarf Holy Priest
---
People who play on Off hours/weekends, or dont always want to raid are more than welcome to join as well, we want to always have something going on. We will accept any role interested in our non primary raid times currently, as well as anyone who is just looking for a home for classic.
---
Look up Pronator on Youtube for some of our older raids, and guild meetings to get a feel for us.

Asmongold does it again
---
I fucking love him
---
same
---
I never went there as alliance. Is there any FP or an outpost or any quests there? Most zones of that level don’t have any actual contention, the contention in Stonetalon (at least on the horde side) is purely fighting NPCs at Stonetalon Peak
---
No fun allowed!
---
Only here for DRAMA
---
he should be turning up with a fat 2h for early dungeons
---
This is absolutely hilarious
---
u/waterguy12 would like this
---
BOVLAR DO SOMETHING
---
God damn it Bolvar, do something!
---
You could see the plan die in their eyes when Bolvar sat there
---
Totally get that, I'm hyped too, but there's work to do, I mean a polished game goes a long way keeping the people there :/
---
I second this, also 3440x1440
---
Yeah, that's pedantic as fuck. No one gives a shit. Confirmed loser.
---
WoW Classic was built on a dataset imported into the WoW Legion client.
---
There’s too many differences between legion and classic to easily find; which is why we’re big testing, and relying on the memory of those who actually played the vanilla game.
---
They did this because they thought it’d save money, importing classic data into legion; rather than just posting over the classic client
---
Too many things are going to be missed, because vanilla isn’t legion...
---
BOLVAR, DO SOMETHING!
---
None of the stormwind leaders are attacking! Where is Omar?
---
Probably one of the funniest things I've seen in awhile lol
---
I actually like Tipsout on this topic.
---
He reports a really good amount of reasonable stuff and doesnt attack people in open world PvP who do legit Beta testing.
---
Bolvar is bugged, on retail i used to kill Teremus with him tanking...
---
AsmonGOD
---
[Name undecided] [NA] [EST] [ALLIANCE] [CASUAL] [PvP or PvE undecided]
---
I keep looking through and all I see are semi hardcore and hardcore Guilds but not a lot of casual Alliance guilds so I'm going to make one.
---
If you're just looking for people to have fun, go to dungeons, quest together, and curb stomp in bgs with then look no further. I'm just looking to have a blast playing the game and not have to search for pugs each time I want to do dungeons or battlegrounds and I think some people feel the same way. 
---
As far as Raiding I'm all for it. But there will be no set schedule. If you end up wanting to raid with your buddies in different guild or just raid with randoms feel free to.
---
This guild is basically to help players find friends to play throughout the game with and have fun. I work two jobs, I don't want to have work at playing WoW too. Being semi hardcore and hardcore is fine too, to each their own, but this guild is for the Casuals just want to have fun, with some possible raiding on the side. Leave a comment if you're interested. And also try to think of a cool name for the Guild if you're intending to join.
---
 People like you are the reason retail sucks.
---
MCCOOL
---
Did he forget about his aeo spell that heals him per player hit?
---
This is hilarious. Stuff like this is what I love most about wow.
---
Asmongold has done more damage to the Alliance and Stormwind than the Horde could ever hope.
---
Asmongold for Warchief!!!!
---
BOLVAR DO SOMETHING
---
VARIAN WOULDNT JUST STAND THERE
---
This shit is fucking hilarious. I'm in tears.
---
Can't wait for the tears..  
---
People forget this stuff always happened in vanilla.
---
It's appening !
---
Hi, /u/jkfriendly410
---
Blizzard's fault for capping at level 30! Asmongold is a man of the people and is taking the flight to Lizard!
---
None of the Alliance Boss NPC's give a single fuck about the dragon. Not sure if thats a bug or not, I feel like they should be attacking a dragon in the city
---
Awwww
---
Its retarded
---
Ah, 20min corpseruns...
---
dracarys!!!
---
It’s so funny how every fucking npc is passive and no one can do anything xD
---
HES JUST STANDING THERE...MENACINGLY!
---
If you're at 40 and need cash for a mount, do pick pocket runs then.
---
I mean, it's literally not worth talking to you
---
INB4 the no fun allowed police come in and stop this from happening in the future. People pulled world bosses back to cities regardless of streamers
---
Not enough people. This is why we need more people in the Beta, Blizz.
---
I think even with a large initial launch, we will still see and interact with the players like we did back in the day. I wouldn't knock on it yet, but I do hope for that same experience you posted about. I use to play with a pretty great WSG team before Arathi Basin. I loved that your reputation was known on both factions. :)
---
LET THE DRAMA BEGIN LADS
---
Im going to assume he welcomes a break from hearthstone with open arms, running as fast as he can, with a swiftness potion 
---
mostly joking never really watched his hearthstone stuff but im sure he is cool with a break from it
---
As a Redditor I find this OUTRAGEOUS Asmon should be permanently Banned!
---
True but thottbot-theme doesnt matter if you want to find information... the theme doesnt come with the old data. :P
---
Ive tried and 40+ mobs are ?? on wowhead classic due to beta being capped to 30, so anything 10 levels above that are skulls.
---
Classic bait.
---
Before we all grab our pitchforks and go after streamers as a community... lets remember one thing:  
---
**This is a beta test**  
---
Let them do all this now and break it before we get the finished product.
---
He can really create some good content   \^\^
---
Arent bosses suppossed to be leashed to their zones in 1.12?
---
Varok would've cleaned up this mess in a minute
---
I don't remember it being this bad in vanilla
---
OMAR SAVE US
---
By making exactly like vanilla?
---
I think you hit the nail on the head with that better than I ever could, spot on.
---
McConnell proves to be a prophet once again.
---
Because they're doing things people did in classic?
---
Everyone is Pepega
---
You know people kited elites and bosses to cities in Vanilla before streamers right?
---
This shit happened before streamers in normal classic. Calm down.
---
But here you are, replying.
---
Why would they care dude.. they’re here to stream not report bugs. Enough people will report bugs
---
It's fun mate. Get out
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
That's a blanket statement that may jot be true. Say you could still kite Kazzak all the way to storm wind in 1.12 and he could kill everyone there. At some point they patched his behavior script, which then had the same issue when they replaced him with Highlord Kruul until they removed him later in TBC. So if something was found to be overpowered, exploitable, etc I don't know how they'd leave it that way simply because it was that way in 1.12
---
Still plenty of time to address problems :)! Stay positive!
---
Zg should be getting cleared every week for pants/helm enchants anyway.
---
Huh?
---
Fucking biblical
---
Re-rolled a million times as I could never make a decision on what class to play so I had a handful of lvl 25-50 characters. Probably my only regret is not focusing on one character.
---
Oddly decided a gnome rogue was my calling and once I got Helm of Fire and beast enchant on my phantom-blade (or weapon damage enchant I can't remember) I felt so freakin cool and played Hillsbrad defender for months not really ever getting into endgame content, but mostly defending low levels and ganking the Horde with my little red helmet.
---
Finally rolled a priest and went through endgame but then learned how fun mind controlling people off cliffs or MCing elites to kill them were. 
---
I know none of this was wasted time because these memories even if I was by myself made it a lot more enjoyable and had me maniacally laughing as I sent another poor soul into the depths of engulfing lava near the entrance to Molten Core.
---
Ahhh can't wait to do more stupid things :)
---
you really think hunters won't be pulling shit like this when it actually comes out? this doesn't have anything to do with streamers, literally just 1 hunter can do this alone
---
I always hated this zone. It had one of the worst runbacks, and all the quests were so far spread apart. Plus, the atmosphere never did much for me. I prefer the Alliance counterpart of Redridge. Both are red ridges, but Redridge just looks so much cooler, and I love the castle setup with the bridges over the tight river.
---
Absolutely brilliant, even switched from pink sparkles stream for this!
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Birds Of A Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
**What we are looking for:** Someone who is dedicated. We require 80% attendance otherwise you may be subbed out. We understand things happen but just don’t make a habit of it. Someone who can raid on Tuesday and Thursday between the hours of 7PM/8PM EST to 10PM /11PM EST. Someone with a good attitude, doesn’t rage, and doesn’t complain. Someone who is willing to help others and is team-focused and not individual focused. Someone who is competent, willing to learn, and ask questions if they don’t understand so they can do it right.
---
**How we operate:** As stated above we will be raiding two days a week sometime between 7-11ishPM EST on Tuesday and Thursday. As for loot we will be running Loot Council. The team will decide how to distribute loot based on several factors including (but not limited to): Attendance, performance in raids (Moreso your ability to listen and do mechanics as opposed to pulling high numbers.), what you contribute to the guild (helping other players, crafting/enchanting things for people, etc.),  and just helping the guild in general.
---
**What we are recruiting:** You can see what we are recruiting for on our website.
---
You can contact me on discord @ frail\_#3482
---
Here is our App: https://boaf.enjin.com/recruitment
---
U nuts
---
You're a fucking cry baby OP.
---
Completely agree.  Why STM / Thousand needles instead of Hillsbrad + Arathi.
---
At least the streamers are pulling in lots of viewers, people who are actually interested in the game; and know what’s a bug, so they can report it through other methods
---
I will fight for him. For the HORDE!
---
thats because you are a p\*\*y and dont enjoy the game... a BETA
---
I mean people did exactly the same during vanilla.
---
Sigh, another streamer witch hunt.
---
A.) It’s beta
---
B.) Why would no one else need?
---
C.) Were there established loot rules?
---
Any player knows when a rare BoE drops, it’s a need battle.
---
This man is the true legend that classic needs
---
Greetings! Need help?
---
HELP US BOLVAR WHAT THE HELL??
---
Get a grip
---
"Need help?"
---
Hi, /u/Jbuky
---
You know he's just taking the piss right?
---
We have to trust that OMAR will bring us salvation and tell Bolvar actually protect his city.
---
LOL nice bait ;)
---
This is a bait thread....
---
Someone heard Mcconnel.
---
Cataclysm all over again !
---
Down vote this pleb
---
lmao no
---
The irony isn't the problem.
---
It's how easily the chat is into being manipulated to create threads about this.
---
PEPEGA
---
Now they are pulling him to Undercity. lul
---
I’m not gonna lie when they met him at SW gates it was pretty epic.  I cheered and cracked up watching this.
---
The Literal God of Content
---
Have a one on one with your boss. Tell them how great Classic is.
---
2004 client, prefer the jankiness over a BFA reskin I gotta pay for that'll die in a few months.
---
Same...I’ve been getting obsessed with watching the beta...but my god he is annoying.
---
Such talent
---
I think he downloaded the wrong game.
---
Like I’ve also seen priest not doing their job, warriors, pallies etc...  I’ve seen just as many wipes from priests trying to dps and not heal, warriors dpsing instead of tanking.. are you gonna make macros for that as well?
---
They were just sackless 
---
I would be SCREAMING lol
---
Shit!  I can just print this at work on canvas, surely someone will fix the spelling lol.
---
THE BELLS!
---
Nope, disagree with all this for Classic. It exists on retail and that's enough.
---
Classic made you do all this stuff for a reason.
---
Preach brought up a lot of good points (upgrades, danger level in questing, community) but I think my favorite was his point on story. WoW used to be the story you and the people on your server made.
---
Fun fact, Asmongold's raid was kiting Teremus the Devourer to Stormwind as you were writing your post.
---
good luck getting most of the bis on the list you posted lmao
---
I use to play hunter, I was terrible at preparation so one time me and some Guildies were doing UBRS and my role was to kite the last boss whilst they killed the adds, little did they know I’d ran out of arrows and was too ashamed to tell them, so I was wing clipping it and running away, needless to say I caused a huge amount of wipes. Until eventually someone fount out what I was doing and recorded it in stealth and put it on YouTube with the benny hill theme tune...😂
---
To me the great part of it is exactly that there isnt much to it, you really got that feeling that now You are on a deep adventure and that the few people in the town were in the same boat as You. When You got back from question in the middel of nowhere this is what You Come back to, and it's just the very basics that people made a town out of. Really sold the Whole tanaris zone for me, loved loggin out in that town in the middle of no where, felt great.
---
I don’t have time to farm, I want gold tokens in the game, it’s  for my wife and kids sake.
---
world first on a small lvl30 capped closed beta lmao
---
there's like no possible way to get like half of my priest bis during the 1 day the server is open. even if i grinded for one of those world drops from beginning to end i'd be lucky to get one
---
i think it'd be better to sacrifice "bis" for "achievable bis"
---
Is it new way of begging for some sort of likes?
---
Don't worry, he'll soo get a promotion to just sitting there
---
Greatest thing to happen in years! Friggin awesome Asmond!!!
---
Bob: You know I'm retired from hero work. 
---
Edna: As am I, Robert, yet here we are...
---
In RFC on my shaman, I couldn't rez someone who jumped into the lava and died. So I jumped into the lava and died. There were probably more, but this is the one that always sticks with me.
---
I did something similar, although not quite as intense during retail vanilla.  Farmers had been flooding the large brilliant shard market when they could solo DM, then blizzard announced they would be fixing  DM to no longer allow it to be soloed.
---
I saw my chance and bought hundereds of gold worth of large brilliant shards I ended up near broke and had to make an alt to hold all of them, then I waited for the patch to drop and not long after I sold them all for 10x profit, was flush for the rest of my retail days.
---
the game popularity is now to the point where  blizz can get away with this kind of shit and ppl like OP will applause and white knight them.
---
doomed
---
just fuck off dude :)) nice story though, imagine if it would be real :))
---
It's both
---
These are the kinds of player experiences people talk about when they want to play Classic again.
---
Only took a few sentences to mention the job and kids.
---
It’s so friggin great man 🤣🤣
---
&gt;I prefer that experience the 2004 Feel. I watch streams everyone is pulling up a guide and go point A to Point B trying to get to lev 30/Max to do PVP setting hearthstones etc.
---
Well yeah and thats what makes it more enjoyable. Dont get me qrong i enjoyed vanilla as a noob but you can bet your ass u would have enjoyed 1000x more if i had a clue about what i was doing.
---
Need help?
---
dammit bolvag
---
*hangs head in shame*
---
the op is a retard anyway, I'd take the 70% bet every time.
---
Genuinely one of the funniest Classic moments so far!
---
People dying everywhere...
---
Bolvar: "Need help?"
---
Ditto
---
Perplexity is a European playing on an American server. This is what client side movement prediction on 150+ms ping looks like. There is nothing to look at.
---
Ya think? Hmm guess ill find out here in a few months :)
---
yeah, all crying about streamers in beta and shit.
---
And then there's people like you who take these threats seriously. Lol. Sad.
---
Lmao, I bet it would not happen in your private server.
---
What do you mean? Spells didn’t miss until... I believe Cata. And I don’t think there was a miss animation.
---
Yes because molten core mobs have fire resistance. After MC mages spec into fire.
---
Bring it
---
Fuck you.
---
&gt; Hunters can easily top meters all the way up to Naxx
---
LOL no. No chance.
---
It's pretty depressing how many people in bfa are writing off classic wow as if it's just nostalgia and rose tinted glasses, they forgot what made wow fun and are afraid to go back
---
I think I got what u want, u want to know how far they went with that development...but you know what most of the vanilla devs are no longer working for blizzard so if there were that on their plans that never happened. IT'd be awesome if they launch a parallel patch with new raids and content nothing to do with tbc...
---
So having higher ac will make you take less damage than the agi avoidance will reduce. As you get maybe 5% dodge but you take an additional 20% physical... using monkey mail/plate gear will be better than leather for tanking... as you can get agi on plate gear...
---
lol ez clap
---
I always forget it exists.
---
B-but Arms ranks the best anyway
---
I tried to go back to EQ years and years ago. I couldn’t do it then doubt I could now.
---
now it looks like Venruki is massing a horde force to intercept them
---
I mean this also found a bug, Bolvar was supposed to attack but didn't despite being breathed on. Beta testing is meant for testing and it's all good fun
---
'Official' speed runs will be a thing instead of progression. I don't have the free time to participate, but I'm giddy thinking about the videos of speed runs.
---
It's by definition ninja though:
---
&gt; A player who, when in a group, rolls "Need" on BoE recipes for a character they are not currently playing.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_ninja
---
Spell "misses" displayed as "resist" in Vanilla.
---
Now they're trying to kite it to Undercity. It's gonna be a logistical nightmare getting the dragon through places like the Badlands, but kudos if they can pull it off.
---
I came here with an open mind because i personally wouldn't mind some QoL changes. I stoped reading after this:
---
&gt;Do you REALLY want to walk all the way to dungeons every time?
---
Damn yes i do. The game isnt tailored to you specifically. Xou dont have time but others might. I dont have the time i haf back in the day and i still wann do that, and even if i didnt i wouldnt expect blizzard to change the game for myself while ruining the game for many others. Just stick to retail.
---
If this is a serious post, you're a dense clown.
---
No kidding. Leveling with sharding means I have no chance of recognizing people I could get to know on my faction or the other. Its the best compromise between the two.
---
If retail WoW went with layering instead of sharding (and did the same with LFG and LFR where only your server would populate it) the game would be very different than what we have today.
---
It called twitch dude
---
Mcp?
---
I tanked as fury right up until it stopped working in TBC Heroics. :P
---
But I was also like our 4th-5th "tank" so it wasn't a big deal.
---
Some clarity on the post. The image was taken from the BradyGames Battle Chest Game Guide which is a mini guide version containing half of the content of the BradyGames WoW Master Guide, 2nd edition which was published in 2006 as per the link provided. 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_Battle_Chest_Guide
---
The link says that the Master Guide was an updated version of the original 2004 Game Guide including “class strategies”. So it remains unclear as to whether this table of information existed in the 2004 guide or was changed/added in the 2006 guide and hence the copy I have.
---
Sorry for any confusion caused, this is only my 2nd reddit post. I will try to be more clear in the future.
---
There are obviously blatantly anti-ranged fights where this isn't the case but they remain very competitive in MC / Ony / BWL / ZG / AQ20 and some AQ40 fights, at least in my experience.
---
We werent the most hardcore guild running all over azerorth for world buffs and we happily brought meme specs but I would consistently top damage meters as an MM hunter. Once I got my crossbow of smiting from Chromag I was destroying meters until casters caught up with AQ gear.
---
We didn't even touch naxx so my knowledge of that is just looking at other guilds parses
---
Ah, well can’t change it now 😂
---
why ctrl+(key) over R T F G V and Y, though?
---
I’m dead.
---
Wholesome as fuck.
---
I got a very rare drop in the charred vale killing harpies back in TBC days, it was a blue one handed mace that was being sold for around 100 gold in the market, lets just say it made a rather poor blood elf level 30 or so paladin really happy.
---
That was from private server
---
As someone who played from Australia on a US server back in vanilla, this is exactly how it works with high latency
---
I love/hate when he announces to the whole raid when his attacks get parried. It's like... okay?
---
apology for poor english  
---
  when were you when dragon kill stormwind?  
---
  i was sat at home watching MLP when son ring  
---
  ‘stormwind is kill’  
---
  ‘no’
---
Calm your tits.
---
They are taking it to Undercity now ahaha
---
This actually looks fun lol I remember this from classic.
---
I love sonii
---
"It's retarded"
---
Nice argument. Layering is the same thing. The word sharding got too much flak so they changed it to layering. Layering is just sharding on a bigger scale.
---
There is a FP in the north
---
i have mixed feelings on this. the garrosh reveal in stonetalon is honestly amazing (even if stands as a painful example of what could have been) but the stuff that comes before it is honestly kind of lackluster and claustrophobic after your first playthrough. it's still a zone i would recommend everyone do once though, and a good example of a revamped zone.
---
personally i started with cata stonetalon and when i tried the original, i was surprised to find how much more i enjoyed it when i was able to walk around at my own pace and enjoy it without being dragged around a bunch of mini quest hubs. i prefer the vanilla one, but i think they each have their pros and cons
---
It doesn't matter. Once the nostalgia wears off (and it will), what you'll find underneath the nostalgia shine is a great game that you'll enjoy.
---
This is the funniest shit I've seen in a long time. Now they are taking it to Undercity!
---
Say what you will about Asmongold, but he does know how to push a beta server to its limit.
---
This is like something out of a 2014 Swifty video!
---
At least it confirms that kiting does indeed work again like it should. I am happy to see this.
---
They’re bringing it to Undercity.
---
&gt;Always
---
Yeah that's a pretty big stretch
---
I remember raiding in vanilla watching YouTube videos as prep...
---
Just a goal. Nothing mandatory about it. And it’s just my goal. I wouldnt force people to be 60 by that time.
---
yawn
---
Different reps, I think
---
&gt; /party "Why does this group have 3 Warriors?"
---
And they're still looking for a tank for some reason.
---
I love this
---
Erm, no while I appreciate what streamers do for the game. I wouldn't be caught playing with them. What they do to servers is never a good thing.
---
“Wife’s son” I will literally never *not* laugh at this.
---
As a wow dev tester. I would be happy that this happens. It's called a stress test for a reason. You know how hard it would be to simulate this? this is basically free.
---
The hero we need but do not deserve
---
He’s not RPing he’s just goofing around. I still think we should have RP-PvP servers though. at least 1
---
Nice, Sonii's an entertaining dude, he is probably the one that has given the most content from the horde side so far.
---
Loved doing this in vanilla!  Thanks for reminding me.
---
this is fantastic because it's not only hilarious, but it's also a hallmark of actual vanilla behavior and a great test of some aspects of classic that wouldn't normally get tested
---
props to whoever arranged this
---
Have fun in Undercity lad
---
I've not seen this once...
---
 **ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ**
---
Where can I find the video?
---
Good luck on your endeavors lol
---
gr8 b8 b8 i r8 8/8
---
This has to be the world's longest kite.  Theyr'e going to UC now.
---
Fucking kid with beta
---
Layering is not sharding.
---
Sharding would be useful for a problem \*we'll\* have. Overcrowded newbie zones at launch.
---
Layering is useful for problems Blizzard has.  What to do after all the tourists leave and how to estimate how many servers you need when you have no box sales to to gauge interest.
---
What about account sharing hmmm?
---
„Need help?“ 😂 made my day
---
Even when I played vanilla people were still meta slaves. There were definite best cookie cutter builds, BiS, rotations, etc. The information was easily accessible even back then.
---
Get this unvaxxed man-child another soy-milk
---
ITT: people with sticker shock
---
Yes it really does take on average 10 days raw playtime to level using a guide, especially if you consider constantly dying in world pvp.
---
And no you are not Joana.
---
Someone with high ping from EU experiencing high ping issues??  Wow who would have guessed that?
---
Have you seen a WoW discussion outside of /r/classicwow?
---
No, no one has ever thought of that in 15 years.
---
Wouldn't that just Hearth you?
---
Yeah I feel the same. Seems no different to my experience at all on pservers as an Australian, or even back in vanilla as an Australian
---
Just to be clear, I'm aiming at beta testers who use this as an early access
---
Yes, I am active in wow and classicwow subreddits...
---
Honestly, I'd recommend private servers - I was ripping my hair out waiting for the beta invite, and gave in and rolled a lock on a private server.  
---
I think most people have done the same too because there was ~15,000 people on when I was on.  It is definitely scratching that itch and its good practice for figuring out which quests are worth it with the huge amount of players.
---
If you PM me I can tell you the best vanilla server but automod will delete my post if i mention it.
---
Im not certain if the number of servers for retail have been released yet, but day 1 in August will probably have more people on it than the stress tests did. I was there for classic release - or rather i was technically there since it was broken and died every few minutes for sometimes days. 
---
A lot is riding on Classic having a successful launch. If it cant sustain the people and its a shit first week it WILL damage the game and community going forward. Its a compromise of purity, yes, but within week 2 it wont matter anymore, but the lasting benefits will be there.
---
Trust me I want a pure experience. If I could id have them run 1.0 at launch and let patches come at the same intervals including balance changes. That would be great for the game mechanically. But I would like people to be able to play the game, and lets be honest, if the servers were queued up to all hell and disconnecting you constantly - thats the Vanilla experience at launch. 
---
Im fine with some concessions if it makes the game better without damaging the integrity of the game itself. My experiences with layering felt fine. People are everywhere. You could have to group people for easy quests just for taps. It feels like i remember leveling back then. If anything its more populated than ever.
---
Pretty freaking wholesome, good for her! She shouldn't of been embarrassed at all with the /played as long she had a good time playing!
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Activision and Blizzard are the same company, they can't "just leave"
---
&gt; There are obviously blatantly anti-ranged fights where this isn't the case
---
Most Vanilla fights punish melee way more than ranged tho. 
---
&gt;We werent the most hardcore guild running all over azerorth for world buffs and we happily brought meme specs but I would consistently top damage meters as an MM hunter.
---
You wouldn't in any decent guild. And world buffs are far stronger in the hands of melee than ranged. They scale harder.
---
No. Warlock was garbage until they buffed pretty much every single dot.
---
Warlocks are PvP gods in 1.12.
---
Hunter and warlock pets broke more of my vanilla runs than anything else. I'm sure its the same for others, to the point that I don't think pet anxiety can be considered obnoxious anymore.
---
I love this game !
---
Don't pepega on a serious thread like this.
---
Hum, I might on my old hard drives from 2007. If not I can scan my hard copy with our 1200 DPI Office MFP.
---
Won't someone help the poor thing? It's on fucking gorgrond
---
what does this mean
---
A very genuine well thought out post. The real question is do I try and find a significant other before wow and get them to approve of my wow lifestyle or do i just accept that i may never get laid again but more time for wow. 🤔
---
Confirmed:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8ibR5Koy7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8ibR5Koy7Y)  
---
This video at 2:53 you can see Bolvar fighting Teremus. Kind of hard to tell who it's targeting but when the dragon dies you can see the exclamation mark appear above Bolvar and he runs back to his standing spot next to Katrana and Anduin.
---
OP DESTROYED with FACTS and LOGIC
---
You’re right. I think Blizzard is dramatically underestimating how many people will play Classic. It makes me really concerned that they will renege on their promise to get rid of layering after Phase 1.
---
Stonetalon on a pvp server is basically redridge.
---
On pve servers, it suffers from the fact that it has a handful of quests for 18-22 and then a handful of quests for 25+
---
Also doesn't help that the quest givers are all spread out, including some in hidden passes inside sun rock retreat.
---
Because of this, most people just skip the first half and stay in the barrens.  If you wait until you've finished the northern barrens quests, you'll miss half the quests because they'll be low green and not showing !'s

all i know is, a lvl 30 shoulndt be able to live trough 2nd hit from a 45 elite. Yet, on Beta its not a problem.
---
Speaking from pserver experiance, the scaling there was SUPER unforgiving. If you atempted a skull mob (11 lvls above you) you would get crushed and crit on every hit. On beta, its a joke :(
---
\#makeclassicharder
---
imagine watching streamers
---
Sure if your aim is to grind faction rep at that point in the game.  Leveling up your first char you shouldn't go STM it's awful in so many ways.  The ghost walk is horrid.  The quests are sparse.  And how long do you want to stare at red sand mountains... the place is not diverse at all in environment unlike most other areas.
---
this has to be a troll
---
The people in this sub already know what preach is gonna say. 
---
Unfortunately this kind of stuff gets shut down in /r wow. People are telling me over there I shouldn't post this video there. If anything that video was designed to show BFA players that classic is more than nostalgia.
---
People will always find a way to bitch over anything.
---
&gt; afraid to go back
---
Slow gameplay, very poor balance, most specs are completly useless, pvp makes no sense with CC lasting 30+sec and raids have already been cleared, there is nothing to discover.
---
I can't say I love BFA, but it's still waaaay better than anything classic has to offer.
---
and people say streamers aren't paid clowns
---
"we've got 3 warriors and none of you can tank?"
---
Man, themechanic and Zeroed are gods
---
Nice post, I've already been doing this :)   
---
I've been editing videos like an absolute mad man.   
---
Once classic is here there is no chance I'll be inspired to be creative.
---
At least, not for a solid month...

Get everyone to meet at northshire. You guys can get started while they run. They will get a fair bit of experience from the run itself. The elwynn forest campaign is great and leads you right into deadmines at 17+.
---
Well we were decent enough to do everything but Naxx :)
---
And I agree melee is usually punished way more which is why hunters excel on so many fights
---
Up your hoop.

 We have roughly 40 people who will be playing Classic WoW here with the launch expected 4-6 Months(Summer of 2019)  The roles of what ever class and profession are open but it looks like we may be hurting for Druids, healers and hunters. In our discord we breakdown everyone's committed profession, race and class. Whisper if you are interested and I will get you the discord information or ask addition questions. Thank you!
---
who the hell shares a screenshot of a video service that offers free video clipping?...
---
This might be a dumb question but with the graphics options for classic, are they going to have an option for updates character models?
---
This isn't really elitist, it's just a preference.
---
Most of those private server streamers are actually really nice. Tipsoutbaby and Esfand are some of the kindest streamers on all of Twitch.
---
hahahah all the streamers
---
why do you care if people that don't like the game don't play it? wanting it to be fun and super mega epic for everyone is what turned wow into what it is today
---
1-27 is like 13% of total xp to 60. It's important to remember scaling, and that lvl 48ish is the half way point to 60.
---
Small brain meme
---
You really needed to post this twice under two different titles? This sub needs an enema.
---
It's probably just a requirement to weed out the less dedicated. It's going to make the guild easy pickings for other raid teams, tho, if this guild doesn't take care of their members

NOISES\*
---
Ashenvale and Darkshore were/are my favorite zones of all time. Stonetalon was one of my most hated zones of all time. I’ll give all 3 another try this time around. 
---
My Dwarf will be having a Nightsaber mount.
---
And a third post about this in 10 minutes. Useless.
---
Lmao you said it yourself
---
&gt; Layering is just sharding
---
Your "memes" are a bit shit mate...
---
Nice staff, it doesn't work with the set however, I recommend a Hydrocane.
---
I know exactly what you mean. Significant others can feel threatened by video games. Ironically, if you were starting at a different, less interactive screen (e.g. Netflix), it would be considered totally normal and of no concern.
---
My only advice would be to keep it real with any suitors or debutantes, and to not perform a more traditionally "dateable" version of yourself. Many make that mistake, and ultimately, you'll both be better off with honesty, transparency, and clear expectations.
---
Of course it's not a bug, I am not senile :p  I am 34 years old now, i used to do this weekly with my druid brother. The drop is great for xp.
---
I feel bad now didnt realise it was so coveted he coulda used peasant shield a bit longer I suppose
---
Nothing will ever bring back the feeling of learning WoW the first time. 
---
Even getting a brand new game with a new stat mechanics system, something better than wow that caught on and had 10 million....
---
It still wouldn’t feel like it did when we played WoW the first time. 
---
Since we have played WoW, any mmo we played we will take to it the sense of attempting to “solve” it. And since the internet exists as it does now, that info isn’t hidden knowledge anymore.
---
Original WoW was great for all the reasons it’s great in 2019, but it was also something new for 90%+ of the players. For most it was their first mmo. 
---
I dunno, I’m not using a guide and I’m hoping to find a guild of people who never played vanilla and I’ll shut up about my experience, hopefully then I can experience some form of pve progression.
---
No, character models are one of the thing's you'll not be able to change. However, the old model looks a bit better in Classic than they did back in vanilla due to how they respond to the new light in the modern client.
---
&gt; Well we were decent enough to do everything but Naxx :)
---
Yeah but back in those days people were terrible and had no idea how to itemise.
---
Here's my guild's logs, they're taken on Lbrin ger.

MC
---
Only place a Hunter even gets to top 10 is MC, and that's because of Baron Geddon, Garr, Golemagg, where melee can't DPS for big chunks of the fight.
---
 Idk how people struggle with warrior leveling. Sure it's one of the slowest but with proper hamstring kiting, reverting to staves when you have no better option and a spirit gear offset to put on between pulls it's actually pretty decent.
---
Imagine being a salty bitch like you are right now. Yikes
---
Ahh ok, thanks for the response!
---
My dude, How many memes are you going to spam?
---
Oh, I'm not, if someone enjoys bfa then more power to them, but I see plenty of people on the forums and the wow subreddit writing classic off as a terrible game that people only enjoy because of nostalgia, when that's just objectively untrue
---
My sweet summer child.
---
Fuck sport, everytime you on a boat, flying or auto running, get on the floor and do them push ups and press ups. Get jumping rope for cardio, most importantly. Drink a lot of water and stock up on brain food (not litterly, unless you rolled undead).
---
Yeah, I really miss the old gamer shows like XPlay :(
---
You need a new hobby.
---
Yeah it's fucking insane. Who the hell upvotes this stupid shit? Are there actually people who believe that "layering" will avoid the problems that sharding has? No, it won't. It's absurd.
---
SL is pretty fun, but I always thought you were so pet dependant.
---
Liked SM/Ruin or conflag better for that reason.
---
Also, huge SB and SF crits of course.
---
Specing deep destro with sac pact, then sacing your imp for 6-7k soul fire crits was hilarious in wpvp
---
I'm surprised to see this upvoted considering most of this sub is the embodiment of your post
---
As a horde O almost never stepped into this Zone.
---
Perhaps in Classic I will
---
Facebook Normies don't know this meme yet, this post will be popular
---
Hunters can't use maces
---
Everyone checking new should just report all his posts for spam.

[Patch 2.0.1](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1) I believe was the immediate patch after 1.12. So since this patched fixed some things does this mean these will be in classic:
---
* Fixed an issue where players were re-taining talent based abilities even after re-training.
---
* Fixed an issue where the Warlock spell "Shadowburn" was improperly consuming two Soul Shards.
---
* Fixed an issue where players were able to use "Mana Burn" on mobs and players without mana.
---
* Fixed an issue where Warlocks were able to despawn a pet to gain a free "Soul Shard"in the Battlegrounds.
---
* Fixed an issue where the Warlock spell "Death Coil" gained double the benefit from the talent "Shadow Mastery".
---
If these were present in 1.12 and then fixed in 2.0.1 things like retaining skills points even after respeccing, double benefit to deathcoil, etc might be a bit broken. So be surprised if they left in things that could be exploited or provided unintended benefits.
---
you shouldn't let the opinions of other people ruin what you like, ignore them
---
I cant wait for week one, when everyone tries to play the " world first" card
---
well as a Warlock, you can improve your pet´s resistances, stamina and other stuff by various EQ bonuses. For example, T2 adds +130 res to your demon. That + SL tree and you can solo a mage with your Felhunter.
---
Not sure if mentioned (sorry) and please dont downvote but watching Asmon's stream and he's on a gryphon, and it's got the red arrow next to the gryphon which i think is the next stop button, dont think vanilla had that?
---
\&gt;that'll die in a few months
---
!RemindMe 6 months
---
stop assuming my priorities, it violates me
---
There is no reason they can't make more content. They can just release it on fresh servers, with an opt in to carry over.
---
If you don't want to experience it, that's fine, classic is there in its unaltered state. But if the possibility of post nax or alternate content implementations, I'm all for it. I think it'd be fucking amazingly cool.
---
NA PvP (but open to anything) Alliance  
---
Two players (priest/rogue initially, hunter/warrior alts) looking for a competent raid group on eastern friendly raid times.  We have both raided hardcore since Wrath forward and took a break at the end of Legion.  We both have 2200+ arena side if that matters at all, some rbg experience as well.   Just let us know when and where and you have 2 solid spots locked down!
---
ITT: most people don't recognize a troll when they see one.
---
&gt;You have to realize that most of these streamers were invited to increase the hype for the game, not for their own bug testing efforts.
---
Then it should be called something else besides "beta test". Blizzards forces the submit bug button on your screen during the beta test. They absolutely what anyone partaking in this beta test, to submit bugs.
---
I'm talking about in the beta. Obviously it's been tested elsewhere
---
False.

&gt;?t=3
---
why blatantly repost
---
It’s exactly like the General Forums. 
---
The truth is WoW has catered to a small but very loud whining minority for years. 
---
They’re the ones who got us stuck with LFG, gear being given out like candy, classes so uninspired they put you to sleep, and all of the other “QoL” that actually made the game worse. 
---
And as a result most of everyone who isn’t them has unsubbed or at least is highly dissatisfied with the game. 
---
Their fear is the success of Classic will Make Blizzard rethink retail; which is exactly what should happen.
---
Thank you. I couldn't have put it any better myself..

Others just throw the sports on a side screen and continue the grind, to be fair.
---
Soon (TM).
---
you expected streamers to do something other than garner attention and money?
---
Everything was very well said. I am enjoying WoW in general because I've tried a plethora of other MMOs and even console BR gaming and nothing was socially more fun or satisfying than WoW. I know it's annoying when everyone jumps on a hype, but everything being said in this video is exactly true and what made this game so popular in the first place. 
---
I haven't played since WotLK and I just came back to retail now leveling 1-60 with no expansions enabled,  and one month subscription.  What I noticed is everyone riding around with shiny stuff from their mains and very low social interaction. I feel like every group or person from another server I have came across just tunnel vision on leveling or doing their own thing.
---
Not like you have to interact with every player you come across, but from not playing for years and coming back literally every player I see are constantly moving to the next objective. Vanilla is so crazy hyped and wanted because there was always people up to something or people actually helped you or appreciated the help by returning the favor with a buff or even a simple whisper, "hey thanks!" I swear I hope things change once I hit level 100+ but going through all this old content and even joining group finders I just feel like I'm playing with extremely intelligent bots and not actual players. 
---
I hope the player base truly returns because that's what made Vanilla truly successful.
---
They going to undercity now, you can stop crying.
---
Tired of seeing either of them.
---
based and redpilled
---
It didn't have the button, but you could do so by logging out and logging back in. They already said they're keeping it in iirc.
---
I'd like to point out that this has to be at least the third big event that Soda has slept through
---
Come child, walk into the light and know truth.
---
It's okay, just let go.
---
Hunters marks is stacking. Higher level versions of the spell are not overwriting low level versions. So 2/3 hunters in a group is broken atm. This is partly the reason Asmond was able to clear SM with 2 hunters. He literally told his party and the viewers of his stream to not report the bug.
---
Seems off, already able to hit 1 to 60 on lightshope in under 6 days... yet it tells me it's going to take 3 weeks
---
Hey, I'm glad I noticed something of interest and didn't just get lost in a mundane detail!
---
&gt;Yeah, that's pedantic as fuck. No one gives a shit. Confirmed loser.
---
found the pizza cutter. All edge and no point.
---
Are you one those cringy fuckers that donates to streamers to whine about shit?
---
Maybe, if so I ignored it, lol
---
"no shield sry"
---
Why do you watch them then?
---
&gt;I kind of hate this guy but he needed on an item he can't use what's wrong with you?
---
Umm sweetie... yikes.
---
"you think you do but you don't" - OP, before playing Overwatch probably
---
Wahhhhh wahhhhh I don't like streamers wahhhhhh 😭😭 Who is forcing you to click these posts with streamers in them?
---
&gt;and know what’s a bug, so they can report it through other methods
---
there is no other methods to report a bug. Unless you are logged into the game as a beta tester.
---
Yeah, and it was very clearly a joke when he said that. Because they were abusing it, he said to report it after the  dungeon. Are you so autistic that you can't detect sarcasm?
---
Lmao I lost 1.5 myself.
---
These are beautiful, thank you so much! Especially love the starting zones
---
I'm not going to try and force anything but if there is someone I meet worth dating... they will certainly hear about wow from me. I agree honesty is the best way to go in a relationship
---
It was so fun popping elemental master zhc and nac and tossing a  chain lighting then a ns chain lighting earthshock. Then I think they made the trinkets share a cooldown.
---
This is so epic. I fucking love this game.
---
damn dude, why you all up on streamers nuts?
---
I never saw old AV as I started in TBC. I wish they would do something like a bg weekend that opens up old AV for a few days of the month or something.
---
I like it, the atmosphere is really relaxing, the color scheme fits well and nice too.
---
Only thing I dislike is its a long trek, that snakey road from the troll to its quest destinations is rough.
---
Paly tank
---
You've probably been bullied so much that you have canned responses prepared before hand.

Hey, don’t forget Grim and Azgaz and the other dark storm bois :)

I'm not familiar with dreamscene, but looking it up, it appears that it requires videos in .wmv or .mpeg format. My source files are in .mp4 format. I just finished uploading my source videos to a drive ([https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FuZUSNzVQV30r5NCdDRUvF\_MnrZuTi9C](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FuZUSNzVQV30r5NCdDRUvF_MnrZuTi9C)), so feel free to download and modify the ones you like to use as wallpapers without the need for Steam or Wallpaper Engine!
---
Either way, autism wins
---
You say that like I argued anything else?
---
Improved Imp is actually stupid strong against casters in 1.12, because of the knocback.
---
It also does actual serious damage with the trinket from first boss in BWL.
---
What were those?
---
Rogue at 40hrs a week and 1.4 months seems very accurate. First time playing no guides as warrior playing way too much, took me 3months.
---
I just wish I didn't have to hear his Discord they actually are the reason this is just unwatchable.
---
Would people cry if it operated like a bg weekend? Most of the time it is the later av, but every once in a while we get access to old av.
---
This is still going on. There's currently a battle on the arathi wetlands bridge to bring him to UC
---
If you're thinking about Ice Lance the spell, that's not in Vanilla.
---
Originality loses
---
That's the whole problem to be honest. I don't think that anyone should die in a 5man Dungeon when I'm healing (meaning they just should be on par skillwise) but you never know who whipes the group or is just blind etc.
---
How are they able to kite this at lvl 30 and not just get one shotted?
---
Is that heirloom great? Reeee
---
&gt;Hi Ron
---
[Hey, Billy](https://youtu.be/zBJU9ndpH1Q).
---
1 tank and 3 dps.
---
Honestly for 5 mans you're going to want some CC, but beyond that all the healers are equally capable of healing all the content. Maybe bring a pally/priest/shaman dps to rez.
---
I mean.
---
They did used to ban in vanilla for kiting stuff to where it wasn’t supposed to be. Hahahaha
---
Some time in early wotlk I believe. 
---
In tbc stealth rank 1 was 50% speed and rank 2 was 60%. And there were low tier sub talents (master of subtlety?) that increased your speed but not to 100%.
---
Spells have always been able to miss , just back in the day it would say " Resist " when it actually missed , it says resist now , but only when the target actualy resists.
---

---
I know he was joking when he said “he’s hitting me from a cross the Atlantic” but that actually explains why he was hitting him. XD the ping for an EU player in a NA beta has to be much higher, at least over 120 or more
---
Needs more scenes
---
Your build seems extremely susceptible to dispels. Don't really know why you wouldn't just go soul link instead.
---
Maybe we can hope, if they do new classic content.
---
Mu.mu.mu Monster kill! Yeah i loved  that  too
---
?
---
No, as someone who had and STILL has their Vanilla twink Rogue, you aren't going to see those number :p
---
All hunters from every timeline would like a word with you.
---
Why they think they only need one graveyard when the mountains make corpse runs terrible is beyond me. I plan to avoid this zone like the plague.
---
Basshunter
---
Git gud
---
And people say this sub isn't toxic
---
yea unless you're like aiming for top world speed run not necessary relative to how good it is for hpala pvp
---
You could also spec into felguard summon it and change specs and have a felguard with a different 31 point talent I was dueling highwarlords and winning with a pretty fresh 60 lock.
---
asmon and his cult of 12 year olds\*
---
Don’t care; still don’t want layering.
---
isn't it funny how the game is hard and this guy is struggling? hahahahaha
---
no, it's not. Help the guy or shut the fuck up.
---
Your choice of any meme dps spec.
---
&gt;What to Do With the Final 90 Days of Waiting.
---
Can you do a post for 120 days ? or 150 ? I'm waiting for the tears when the game dies, all this work and hype for nothing, gonna be glorious &lt;3
---
No they dont lol
---
We used to have a guild game. Kite gamon as far as you can without killing him or letting him reset.
---
Was quite fun. Although somewhat less destructive.
---
Thanks for the input!
---
Everyone who disagrees with me is retarded
---
This guy had a pretty bad shield lol. Pretty huge upgrade for him not gonna lie. But yea fair enough.
---
If you mean optimal than I'd sub out the lock for a ret or shaman. Warlock bring the least to a 5 man out of the main dps classes (summoning can be an amazing time saver but if we assume everyone goes to the instance together), and ret/shaman bring more for a group than a spriest does.
---
As a non wow player watching it right now. This is awesome. And makes me wanna play classic. But yeah, fun detected, lets not have fun.
---
60% of the time it works every time.
---
Kited the trash from the green dragon in ashenvale to org.
---
you shouldn't worry about dungeon comps past 1 heal 1 tank 3 dps
---
everything works if people are decent at the game
---
&gt;Also, I can’t unsee the Skyrim font.
---
I knew it was familiar!
---
They get hours upon hours of recorded content from these streamers that they can parse through. It's a beta test, a lot of people don't report anything. A lot of people do.
---
The dragon isnt even in the pic lol
---
This is probably going to get modded anyway, but shouldn't it be 15 years?
---
I'm gonna say it was impossible even in TBC. Definitely not in vanilla.
---
Literally 1 day after TBC Launch :P
---
It failed sadly.
---
&gt; Yeah but back in those days people were terrible and had no idea how to itemise. Vanilla is easy. You can clear it with a raid of Boomkins as long as you have everything else needed for the boss' gimmicks ( remove curse, tranq, whatever ). Doesn't change what I'm saying, melees scale way harder, as do Mages and Warlocks.
---
Yeah forsure, people being noobs definitely played a part in it, and maybe myself and a few other hunters I played with were able to figure things out before the rest of our guildies, or maybe we geared up faster because we were just rocking straight up tier sets so we had no competition for rolls. Alot easier to gear as one of 3 hunters then try to gear up as one of 8 rogues lol.
---
Having a straight up threat dump is awesome for DPS, especially horde side with no salvation.
---
There's a lot of factors. And yes hunter scaling was pretty crappy in vanilla, just the fact that they split up RAP and MAP really hurts hunters for a lot of buffs that would otherwise be very beneficial.
---
I just find it funny how everyone talks like hunters are straight trash in vanilla when my personal experience totally contradicts that.
---
Not everyone is going to play in an ultra-sweaty min-max guild, I would say the minority of people will while the majority play with their friends / whoever they connect with online. 
---
It will be interesting to compare pserver parses to live when its out and see how different they look. I never raided on pservers, only in actual vanilla wow so im not sure how it compares but i've heard things like armor values and mechanics are almost guess work on pservers.
---
yeah, no fun allowed it seems, got despawned
---
This was exactly like GoT - we got Asmon mother of dragons burning down a city full of innocents and then underwhelming season finale with main character despawning
---
I am sure. I cant speak for everyone ofc. I always rwgreted it not playing vanilla since day one because by the time i was 60 BC was coming out and i eidnt get to enjoy the endgame for that long. People have been using addons since they were available, if they didnt before its because they had no idea they existed like myself. My favorite games of all time are the souls series and while i do my first playthrough blind i probably spent just as much time in the respective wikis looking up stuff as in the games thenselves. If you dont want to use addons dont, but let other people do whatever the fuck they want. Just like i do my first souls playthroughs blind doesn't mean i go bitch on the internet about the existence of guides and wikis that i have no obligation to use. Its 2019, there will be guides for every game and peoplo who want will use them and the ones who don't dont.

Rule 7???
---
This is the world of warcraft I want to play.
---
Contested just means like zones above level 20 or whatever, not because there would be strong presence from the other faction.  You were protected from getting ganked in those low level zones by them being faction controlled.
---
This is fantastic! I've been looking for stuff like this for a while, on and off, in wallpaper engine and couldn't really find that good mix of (relatively) low file size and repeatable background. Half the stuff were straight 1gb rips off the youtube "music &amp; ambience" videos.
---
Now like half of these will be my wallpapers playlist :P. I'd love to see some with like, Durotar, or more of the nice comfy warm plains of Mulgore one day. But these aren't really requests-- you've done a fair bit of work already :).
---
Basically the story of Reddit. This entire website complains about everything.
---
Damn I’ve been on this sub for so long that I can’t even tell the difference between trolling and comments.
---
The only reason they are there is bcuz the attention they bring to the game. It’s free marketing for blizzard.
---
I took the sword solely because I thought it looked cooler
---
That was fun watching that.  Hope to see stuff like that when Classic go live.
---
Awesome! Thanks bud
---
There is a bloodelf in stonatalon on the horde outpost that gives you some quests. Idk about other but that one is definitely friendly to horde.
---
Is there a number limit to dots on a target in 1.12?
---
&gt; The truth is WoW has catered to a small but very loud whining minority for years.
---
Thats nonsense. Many of the changes that this sub (rightfully) points out as the biggest problems were celebrated by most people. Crossrealm BGs? What a blessing, finally you can actually play AV again. Flying? Amazing, this is so cool. LFD? No begging for tanks in trade chat anymore, thank god. Heirlooms? Nice, that really makes leveling twinks a lot more fun   
---
I dont say that there was literally no one disliking these cganges. But acting like the vast majority wasnt behind those is dishonest at best and very dangerous at worst. Because it makes it sound like preventinf these mistakes are/were easy. Which is a pure hindsight thing.
---
They do, daily.
---
The only way you can guarantee no one dies in a 5 man is to only do them once you outlevel them and they're super easy which just makes the entire thing super boring. If you're at the same level than wipes are inevitable really, usually a mob will run and will pull another pack when you're already low on mana/hp. Not like all the time obviously but once a run to once every 2-3 runs depending on how aggressive you play and level difference.
---
eh, I look forward to skip it again, just like Desolace and Ashenvale too
---
Actually, it looks like the Green Wyrmkins (assuming these are the NPCs in question) were nerfed earlier than BC. Have a look at these pages:
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20070507151604/http://www.thottbot.com/?n=41005
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20070506082719/http://www.thottbot.com/?n=21513
---
Thottbot had this weird quirk that all variants of a mob were considered separate NPCs, hence why they are links to two separate levels. Note how the version "1.11.2" is noted. If I am not mistaken, this MAY (I can't make assurances here, but context clues suggest so — earlier pages in the history have earlier version numbers, so they aren't suggesting when a mob was added) suggest that the last time these mobs existed in this variant was 1.11.2.
---
Now, look at this page for the non-elite variant (the 42 level one wasn't archived sadly):
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20070505214151/http://www.thottbot.com/?n=628502
---
Note that this one says "2.0.12". Now, this may suggest that this was the patch that they were nerfed, but with how 1.12 is unaccounted for, I find it believable that the Green Wyrmkins were actually needed during the end of Vanilla.
---
Yes it' always true. Arcane shot is pretty useless.
---
Aimed can crit for ~2k with decent gear, while multi shot can crit for ~1.5k, possibly more with full T1.
---
T1 8 set increases multi shot dmg by 15%
---
The 2.5k server cap keeps getting thrown around for some reason like it was the holy number of people that could ever be on the server.  In reality, the server capacity was raised over the lifespan of vanilla, from 2.5k at launch to between 3.5k-5k (Sources vary).  As wow grew, blizzard upgraded their tech and opened up servers for more concurrent players to be on at the same time.
---
Also, I think that it's a fault of this community that raiding keeps being put on this pedestal like it's all the game is about.  Moder wow may be centered around the endgame, but in vanilla, raiding was not the focus.  After 15 years everyone has developed this min-max additude, that before raiding even starts, everyone needs to have pre-raid BiS, full consumables, flasks, world buffs, etc...
---
For all the hate on modern wow, that's a very modern way to look at things.  In actuality, the average guilds in vanilla didn't require that much of their players.  Consumes if they had them and hit-cap/def-cap where the only hard gear requirements;  other than that, just just show up as prepared as possible and know your role.  Sure hardcore guilds existed, but not nearly to the extent as we all see to think that's how raiding has to be done now.
---
We all need to just chill out for a sec.  If we all keep thinking like this, then we are going to burn through content, and burn ourselves out very fast; and classic won't last very long at all...
---
I know Asmongold is very popular and these threads are getting automatic downvotes, but if you feel something is wrong make a thread about it. Also keep in mind Asmon only played for two months in vanilla and he was a kid. Not  bashing on Asmon's fans, but reddit is fundamentally flawed where you can't have a discussion thread without worrying about your reddit karmas being taken from you just for disagreeing with someone's personal favorite eceleb.
---
Fuck tipsout
---
A real mental illness? Good to see you aren’t a doctor.  Ashes of Alar was quite difficult to solo back when I got it in Wrath, quite the achievement actually.
---
Couldn’t agree more. The only great things on retail is the art and mythic raids. M+ and arena aren’t terrible, but it’s a wholly different experience to say tbc attunements and heroic dungeons or the vanilla wpvp/bg scene, with both being worthwhile. 
---
My hope is retail reimplements some rpg elements. Implements layering at the very least, and tries to meet a middle ground. 
---
I’ll always love leveling on classic, and I love the endgame, but I’ve already done it once, I’m committed to once more, but what after that? BC, okay. Well Bc is pretty well regarded by longtime WoW fans as the best the game ever was. I’d play Bc once more. 
---
But at a certain point, (probably right around thinking about doing ez mode naxx, after having progressed in it in classic wow) I’m going to want real new content with an rpg feel in the vein of the Bc/vanilla vision. Wow2? Will retail be fixed? Do I move on with my life?
---
My monitor is AW3418DW. It's really nice. IPS panel at 120hz.
---
Try and sucker some friends to play, put 1000km on my Boosted Board, hit the beach, 3-4 camping trips, drink beer, oh and say goodbye to my family😁.
---
This is definitely the best ahah
---
nah, talking in chat with smaller streamers, around 500 viewers, the big ones it's not even worth talking about, they're 100% hype
---
40 man raid multibox
---
There is no god, it’s a superstition made up by stupid people, the nearest thing to a god is a set of rules that we can’t fully comprehend yet.
---
I swear I saw a video of a full spell dmg geared hunter going around arcane shotting people for 2k+.
---
Might have been in TBC
---
Just use taunt on a hunter's or warlock's pet in gadgetzan. 
---
You can do this with growl and torment too
---
Finding Mankriks wife
---
I know. Thats why I kept going and explained the difference outside of the game description. Did you actually read my comment?
---
Does the SL spec work PvE at all? I planned on going SM/Ruin since it does both but I hadn't really heard if people used SL at all for PvE/Raids.
---
Having strafe keys plus A or D available as separate keys allows you to have your mouse free to click while moving. Without turning keys AND strafe keys you can't manually change targets (left clicking unit frames or players) while turning, strafing, and keeping targets in front of you the same time.
---
This isn't saying that all movement will be from turning with the keyboard, that'll mostly be right click and drag. But specifically when moving in non-straight lines plus changing targets and keeping targets in front of you. This is harder to describe than I thought it would be.
---
“Went down fast” “i missed it” lol ok
---
Most fun I've had in WoW in years.
---
It's good that retail exists though. The players looking for community will come to classic and the players looking for easy stuff and content rollout will find that in retail. I do enjoy the stories that wow has given us but majority of my time will be spent on classic
---
Used those too.
---
The last posting of this was nearly 2 years ago and I just found this video myself. Put the baton down, Reddit police.
---
You really want boxers and ball cap with drink holders.
---
Hunters
---
He can sit his ass in UBRS till it drops lol 
---
Can't ge tthe shield....
---
He mentioned that he had around 110-120ms on stream earlier today.
---
220-250 for regular hits and 330+ for the cleaves, doesn't seem off to me..
---
Fucking seriously.
---
But it is not. Layering pulls people from the same server onto a layer until it reaches the cap of the original vanilla servers around 2500-3000 players. Sharding pulls people from different servers on the the same shard within zones to make the game feel more full. One is cross realm, the other is one server. One allows you to have a server community, one doesn't.
---
I agree tbh. Wouldnt give again knowing how desired it is by pala

you could all meet up at level 1 by having them run to northshire, or you could quest to 10 in your respective zones (elwynn, teldrassil, dun morogh) and meet up in Loch/Darkshore/Westfall
---
And then they immediately despawned him and ended the fun like a bunch of wet blankets
---
I was hoping that since i put it to the post, i'd avoid this "joke", but thank you nonetheless.
---
Lol no. This is what 280ms + looks like. Perplex has more like 110ms to NA servers. You don't hit someone with melees from 10 yards away with 110ms.
---
got the gamer glasses on deck
---
Downranking multishot and getting every consumable imaginable, I was barely able to make it through most of patchwork dpsing.
---
I mean Killing the false warchief Rend Blackhand.
---
The Onyxia attunement quest chain was pretty epic.  So was the Moira Bronzebeard chain in BRD.
---
where are beta servers? California? that ping must be at least 160+ from Europe
---
I wish u got a boarder of extra canvas on this. You could have stretched it and made some serious sexy wall art.
---
I second this second
---
She's going to hate the troll feet. Let her have her nelf priest.
---
"Yeah lets allow this dragon to kill our whole raid multiple times"
---
You say "poor balance", I say that it's a RPG with classes actually having strengths and weaknesses. Everyone on BFA can AoE, everyone can CC, most classes can battle ress.. "Balanced" = all homogenized and diluted down into bringing the same tools. And for all that "balance", every single raid has some class-stacked meme classes, be they tanks, dps, or healers. Every dungeon is an annoying AoE-fest since all tanks can generate AoE threat and all DPS can AoE like crazy. Was it worth it? Some would say, no. 
---
Oh and also, those retarded GCD changes aren't in classic. That alone is enough reason to put it ahead of WoW Retail.
---
...you know, you just reminded me that I never visited the northern part of the region. I quested this a lot of times, but I never went there, until one day I think I managed to get a glimpse of a possible alliance city there? And I always told myself to go check it out someday. But I never did.  
---
And then Cataclysm hit...   
---
I never even checked the Wowhead/Wowpedia page. I think I'll just wait to see it on my own.
---
There is the salt
---
TipsOut is a fucking scumbag.
---
After getting a pure dps class to 60 then lvl’n priest/pally as heals to 60.  Thought I would’ve learnt my lesson w the first healer but I’m slow or a glutton for punishment🤷‍♂️.
---
Is it possible Skeletons do despawn too quickly and like only 1 per charackter activ or something? I remember seeing tons of them at the hunters camp in STV. Yet on the Beta i've seen barely any even when there was like 150 vs 150  
---
Also sorry if this has been mentioned before
---
That's definitely a leftover change from Legion. Faction Leaders were coded to never engage in PVE at some point, not sure when. It was only completely non-combat NPCs that never entered combat, e.g. Anduin, Khadgar, A'dal etc.
---
Daaaaaaaang! That would be nuts. I'm 3rd on the waiting list on the archive.org library for it but it could literally take until launch before being my turn.
---
Suboptimal specs were always suboptimal. Wether it’s an optimal or suboptimal spec, players have improved to get the more value out of them, making the game “easy” compared to what it was on release. 
---
I think it also makes sense to learn from the successes and shortcomings of private servers as the best reference we have for how players will respond to the game. One of those lessons is the overall benefit brought by buffing group content.
---
Beta is level 30 cap POG
---
I wanted to experience a fresh game, not have literally everything done to death by streamers because they had to make 3 months of content for their channels.
---
BoE. Awkward.
---
Yup. Lvl 30 twinked out the arse warrior in defensive stance compared with lvl 36 cat, seems pretty much expected.
---
true, but I just don't think you'd still want to give fury warriors tf over rogues given that it'll still be an issue.

---
About Us...
---
This is a casual/social Guild that will be playing in PvE and PvP aspects of Classic WoW. We played Vanilla WoW on Gurubashi under the same Guild name and some of our members raided MC, ZG and AQ back in the day. We are not a progression guild and have no aspirations of raiding at this time. But if we get some willing raid leads and members interested, we can reassess this later after release.
---
What we are looking for...
---
Mature players looking to PvE/PvP, while having good time with friends and family. Be able to join Discord while running Dungeons/PvP/Raids.
---
What we offer...
---
We have members that played from WoW Beta through to current release. We have Class/Dungeon/Raid experience in Vanilla WoW. And we have always been willing to help others if they have questions, need help with quest or just need help with gankers in open world PvP. Call on us and we will be there.
---
Loot Decisions...
---
Loot Council/DKP - if we ever need it.
---
Contact...
---
DemonFist#7322 on Discord if your interested or if you would like more information.
---
Other games we play currently...
---
Retail WoW, Diablo 3, Overwatch, Division 2, Ghost Recon Wildlands and a slew of other games.
---
Hehe, I won't nolife, I hope to do some healthy 4-6 hours a day for a few months... What about you? :) Enjoyed reading your physiotherapevtic comment
---
No it isn’t nonsense, sorry. 
---
The vast majority of players didn’t say anything. You know why? They were happy with the game.
---
The majority of players never complained in the forums or said a word about not being able to find groups, wanting CR BG’s or anything like that because they were happy with the game. 
---
Meanwhile the only players Blizz was hearing anything from are from the whiners in the forums who felt an already relatively easy MMO was too hard for them. 
---
The only people who “celebrated” the changes were the vocal minority. The vast majority didn’t say a word. They just unsubbed.
---
Deadmines is a level 20 dungeon. Dire Maul, the one OP was reffering to isn't.
---
I remember in wotlk I could just afk on fights like Deathbringer Saurfang and Festergut/Rotface with rogue and still top damage, it was so dumb lol
---
Okay i want to clear this up .. lol 
---
im not bitching! if yo wanna use an Addon a Guide or have someone play the game for you so you can just ENDGAME i really could care less! this post was more so what would you prefer. a 2004 experience of Fresh never felt before vanilla.. a WoW Virgin.. OR the 2019 know how.  I don't understand how anyone can take an offence to this post. lol
---
Armor values are guessed yes, mechanics are not.
---
With the exception of stuff like Onyxia's deep breath, which no one except for Blizz actually knows how works.
---
The damage checks in classic are really not strenuous outside of a select few fights. And even then they were conquered back in the day with people who clicked. Raiding is an exercise in logistics more so than mechanical skill in classic. In PvP every class is viable, as in pve. That said, not every class adequately fills every role at a high skill level, but every class does have viable specs. 
---
If you wanna go down the “nothing to discover route” same can be said of retail, unless youre a top 100 world raiding guild or on the cutting edge of the PvP scene or one of the first to tackle odds things like mage tower, high mythic keys, etc. there is nothing to discover. There is a guide for it, and if you don’t sacrifice your own enjoyment of teaching yourself, your teammates will chastise you. Even casual stuff has a big ass wowhead guide on day 1. 
---
There is more to discover any player who started wow after or during Cata in classic than in bfa. Further, it is far more acceptable to be willfully ignorant in classic than in bfa. And it is completely reasonable to relearn or learn classic on your own starting on 8/27/19 and see all the content, especially if you apply previous basic wow knowledge. 
---
That said, I like both, I raid log with the boys on retail and play beta elsewise.
---
I think the cross realm BGs are pretty necessary considering how polarized servers can be. the other changes were definitely making a deal with the devil.
---
It’s a holiday weekend bud.
---
Yeah, pretty much this.
---
Ugh I can already see it now.
---
Warr, Pala, Druid in dungeon grp. "I'm dps."
---
Did I say they could?  You feeling okay?
---
I think they already have, see none of the NPC attacked the dragon which is wrong as in vanilla the coding could not detect what was event and what was not so they just attacked stuff.
---
Cuz they know that Officer Brady can handle things
---
Why do you think that lol?
---
i don't see anything wrong.
---
I downvoted, and not because of bfa
---
Outside of reck bombing, ret is still trash in PvP tbh
---
This isn't actually the stress test, the next one is on Wednesday.
---
I had a misspelling in my character name. Most people saw this but assumed it was intentional. I didn't realize the mistake myself until level 57. My misspelled name was on the screen thousands of times and I didn't notice. It stuck well enough that I still use the moniker in combination with other words.
---
Mad Alliance cuck detected LUL
---
Well Spriest is hardly a meme
---
I remember this happening all the time in Vanilla through TBC, keep in mind people's MS back then varied a LOT and having under even 150-ish was considered good (least in Vanilla). 
---
Is this something that functioned differently on private servers? He has latency being from EU, seems like that could be all it is.
---
So he can't use it, what's the problem?  Did you plan to need roll on it? lmao  You must really struggle in social situations.
---
Hunters can top onyxia for sure
---
Exactly, not to mention we didn't know long term what the affect of these additions would be. The community only began to realize what was happening when it was too late.
---
I got HOJ on my rogue during my MC attune quest and didn’t use it as I opted for trinkets that I thought were better.
---
If you both have wands you can literally both level with no talents and be fine.
---
Yeah that was one of the main examples. I also read that mobs typically used their spells / abilities on cooldown where in real wow that is not how the mobs functioned.
---
Like I said I didn't raid on pservers but I dabbled in leveling and I can say some of the mob behaviour was totally out of whack. Maybe they paid closer attention to raid mobs / encounters
---
I like that.
---
&gt;he did nothing wrong
---
I really have to spell out the fact that people shouldn’t roll need on things they can’t use? You feeling ok?
---
ThE gM's DeSpAwNeD tHe DrAgOn GuYs!!! - asmonbald
---
Gratz, at no point did I say I was on beta
---
They had enough hunters and druids to get it through BRM, but the Horde met them at Thandol Span and Teremus despawned.
---
I approve of this. Hope you can keep it up! Personally I am merging the sports section into progress.
---
Goldshire..... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Theres no real utility doing that. The voidwalker is garbage in pvp, obviously, but it gives you options such as distraction or pure healing + lifetap for max damage to deal out. That on top of siphon life you get so much hp regain that you could literally be getting wacked by multiple foes and just shrug it off launching spells. 
---
Of course theres no perfect fit as its rock, paper, shotgun gameplay with every class. It was also somewhat complicated to keep track of dots and situational spell rotations, because you think about it it was at minimum 5 spells I would have to keep track (corruption, agony, siphonlife, flame, fear, lifetap, well I guess 6). However like I said I could walk in a group of 1v5 and it was shocking how often I would come on top. There was of course times in which I did not but that was more of the exception than the rule.
---
One gy and no flight path at the troll village make me hate the place. But it’s good leveling regardless, so I go. 
---
But that lack of “civilization” does make it feel remote and isolate, like a mountainous region would have, so I do enjoy that aspect of it.
---
Human Priest
---
Dwarf Warrior
---
Night Elf Rogue
---
Gnome Mage
---
Orc Warrior
---
Troll Mage
---
Forsaken Warlock
---
Tauren Druid or Shaman (can't decide)
---
Seems like easy to fix. Make the guild bank only accessible only if the guild has X amount of characters from unique accounts. Not saying that what you are saying is wrong and im neither in favor nor against the idea. But lets not pretend that there are absolutely no ways to fox things like this.
---
I was laughing and then through everything, “Need Help?”.
---
Funniest thing that could’ve happened 😂
---
Yeah in current wow it is the whole worlds name, but back then it wasn't https://wow.gamepedia.com/Azeroth#/media/File:WorldMap-World-SeasonsOfWar.jpg
---
i think in the wow classic beta, the bottom part isn't called azeroth anymore though 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Azeroth#/media/File:WorldMap-World-Classic-Beta.jpg
---
Well you certainly aren’t on retail either.
---
Literally no one cares about this “achievement” or defending Asmon’s honour, the reason you are being downvoted is the evidence you have provided is not very compelling
---
Dont warriors rely on pocket healers to survive solo?
---
unexpected RvB
---
Faerie Fire was always my ideal kiting spell. Instant, long range, no cooldown, and best of all, Zero damage. It helped me kite anachronos to org a few times.
---
You're obviously free to comment, but I'm curious as to why you're here if you don't like Classic.
---
Yea alright! Thanks for the answer bro
---
Appreciate it dawg 💯
---
10/10 observational skills, want a cookie?
---
Yup, especially since they fixed the leashing at some point. Would be funny if they kept it so you could kite kazzak for a little while though.
---
Bless them for bringing in more kids to dumpster come launch
---
You say this like you’ll have time to get to 60
---
Hmm... is Anachronos up in this patch? That should be the next dude to kite.
---
I can promise the GM’s had nothing to do with it. Maybe layered away, maybe another mechanic, but as long as it’s not breaking the game, the GM’s don’t care. I’m sure they were laughing at it too.
---
Hey man rules are rules. Why are you an exception? Posting pictures of private servers.

I've never seen so much wrong in one post.

Cause boomkin wasn't even in the game until 1.4 (might have been 1.6, can't quite remember).

Hurricane was the lvl 40 talent until they revamped all of the talents for every class.

A strong, consistent group has always proved to bring the most enjoyable game experience. I want to create a medium sized community that everyone loves to be in, and are excited to do content with each other. Raiding will be taken seriously and progression will be the primary goal. Of course we will mess around with PvP but Raiding is our top priority. Would love to have a solid group going by launch so we can do group content together including dungeons, PvP, etc.
---
Jesus this sub
---
Thats really cool!  
---
I’m excited to play it
---
Nobody asked about Nost?
---
I put hundreds of hours into arena in TBC with 250ms. This is not normal. You get something similar to that with pillar humping at 250ms but in a straight line at 110ms? Lol no way.
---
Last I checked there's a guild recruitment sticky every few days.
---
&gt; Erm
---
Never befriend someone who has to type out their mouth sounds.
---
Its a lot harder to keep someone alive in a pinch as a druid but once heals are out, people become hard to kill.
---
Gear is hard to get and people will want to spam dungeons as fast as possible. Just like M+ groups on live.    
---
There will be raiderIO/RaidProgress for classic, 100%.    
---
2 months in if you haven't cleared X dungeon/raid, you're not getting an invite.
---
Seeing how toxic this sub is, it's gonna be even worse than your casual m+ group.
---
They did mate
---
R13 is definitely Elemental gear, but for the high spell power set:
---
Mail "of Nature's Wrath" greens; Deep Woodlands Cloak (or "of Nature's Wrath" cloak); Wildthorn Mail; Briarwood Reed; Shaman class trinket from DM; Eye of Orgrimmar; Barbed Thorn Necklace; 30 spell power enchant on weapon. Weapon/shield/2nd ring have have 0 spellpower aside from the enchant.
---
Some of these pieces will have more spellpower than raid gear. "of Nature's Wrath" has more nature damage than the T2.5 helm, for example. Raid gear is still better thanks to the stats and set bonuses, but you're hardly useless in pre-raid gear.
---
Yea but they can’t make Outland last 4x longer, what if you are a new player starting out? You’d be so far behind on content. 
---
And every additional expansion would be way too much for a new player starting out.
---
Like any class, Warriors will get rekt if they just go in 1 vs the world.  Warriors biggest weakness is their ability to get kited, so having a pocket healer and dispeller goes a long way for them, and allows them to get into and out of situations they otherwise shouldn't.  But they can do just fine if they don't play stupidly.

 **&lt;Desecrate&gt;**
---
***Priority / Purpose:*** Raiding with the intent of clearing all the content when all is said and done. We also want to be social and get to know one another. The core group of the guild has been around for the past 2-3 years doing other Legacy Guilds on retail.
---
***Region:*** NA
---
***Server:*** PVP
---
***Faction:*** Horde
---
***Raid Times (EST):*** 8-11, days TBD. Still deciding as a guild currently, leaning more towards our main group raiding on the weekends and possibly having a second group or alt runs during the week. Loot will also be distributed via Loot Council.
---
***Contact***: Discord. My profile is Bevok#1264, you could also contact our GM on his Discord which is Muff#9531. Here's a link to our discord server as well: [https://discord.gg/62RAekK](https://discord.gg/62RAekK)

***Rules / Expectations:*** There is a time and a place for all kinds of humor. Know your audience. Be respectful to those who have expressed comments. We have NSFW channels for memes and the like for those who want to run a little more rampant.
---
***About Us / Intro:*** We are a group of excited individuals to restart the classic WoW experience and play through the new classic vanilla servers when they go live! This guild will be a culmination of the hard work of many of the leaders we currently have. We had roots started in a guild called &lt;EVOLVE&gt; on Emerald Dream where we performed legacy content at their intended levels on live servers all the way through Throne of Thunder at level 90. We attempted a restart on Nesingwary in a guild called &lt;Ad Initio&gt; when numbers started to dwindle, but then ultimately merged with another guild called &lt;You Think You Do&gt; on Wyrmrest Accord. The leaders of this guild are experienced in the older content and have either actual Classic raiding experience or a great depth of knowledge of the old expansions. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
---
IKR, Imagine if half of his content wasn't stream sniping locations of other streamers good effort on video editing thou.
---
Oh, i was horde in vanilla bruh. Undead rogue, then late i went alliance and joined a high end raiding guild on alleria. I was their NE warrior MT and thye helped me powerlevel a pally.
---
Was alliance for awhile and still did horde once in awhile...with a warlock named Elbastardo.
---
I dont think obvious bugs (like the hunter quiver bug) and other completely broken stuff that gets fixed makes the game worse. We all love classic wow that doesnt mean we have to have a broken experience
---
You don't need to Fear them. They can't cast with Curse of Tongues on them and they can't close gaps. Just hold your 'W' key to keep moving and use your instant dots while they chase you. They die first every time.
---
Thanks, I posted there as well.
---
Yes if you only do BGs you never have to leave the capital, just like nowadays for dungeons too. I think its stupif but this subreddit embraces it because it was in vanilla even tho as a pvp player you have no real incentive to leave the cities which they like to criticize retail for so much. Yes i also fucking hate lfd/r but i also think its stupid to queue up for BGs in the cities and i think it should be like it used ti where you had to go to the BGs entrances to queue up.
---
He's been live on twitch all day https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold hilarious
---
Do you have a list of things I should find funny so I don’t upset you anymore
---
Nothing is wrong. The 60 war only gets hit for the top range when he is Recklessnessed. He is also not in defensive like Asmon.
---
Perfectly expected Herod damage.
---
What “changes” are people complaining about?
---
Ive only seen that one “post naxx vs tbc” argument very frequently.
---
Nah I'm fine.  Notice I play the game, enjoy it, and mind my own fucking business instead of trying to start a witch hunt.  Just stop being jealous of streamers and try to be a better person.
---
If you are UD is it worth bolting to UC right when you get enough mats or wait until you make the trip there at 10?
---
Exactly.  It's a single server world again.
---
You being able to 1vs5 someone is not because of siphon. It heals for 70+ every 3 sec with good gear. 70x5 is every 3 sec + whatever your void sac heals you for is not enough to outheal 5 enemies.
---
The fact you're able to 1vs5 someone is down to the class itself and having Engineering.
---
You are right. They are god-tier hunters! &lt;3
---
You see people doing MC in around 30 mins now. But they have the skill. And you just won't get that. That's just how it is when you won't invest the time. 
---
If you want to raid still I'd suggest rolling a dwarf priest and make friends while leveling. You might be able to tag along in your wow friends runs.
---
Maybe this was before they made it so you couldn't feign drink?
---
The rules do not state that no pictures of private servers can be posted, it states that they should not be encouraged or focused on. This post is focused on a very good boi and nothing more.
---
Is it a bug that Bolvar wasn't attacking it?
---
Also this is the coolest thing ever. When I first started playing the game, I watched a video of Kazzak in Stormwind and right there I thought "I can't wait to do this". Sadly it never happened during my time playing.
---
God damnit i cant wait to die all the way until level 30 and then fuck face once i can stance dance.
---
Then play on a different server from them.  I'm watch them a lot and am entertained but I won't be rolling on their server.
---
Top premades will have these consumes lol.
---
My god, you truly never know what you want until you can't have it. 
---
I never tried to get into the beta because I thought it would just spoil release for me. 
---
Now it's both haunting me and an taunting me!
---
Until you read the average person's responses to the suggestion of it. Lots of purists out there.
---
Well I can only state what Perp said himself? He said 110-120ms when he was running SM GY a few hours ago.
---
Only at the start of Vanilla
---
60 lv 30s? Seems reasonable enough
---
&gt;Happy 30th to RUSH

Not a feat with level 80

By all means, elucidate, instead of just arbitrarily saying that I'm wrong.
---
I'm happy

:D
---
Doesnt seem like it by the looks of the comments here.
---
Enjoying your bought account? You know, circumventing a subreddit ban with another username is against Reddit's ToS.
---
I've honestly been wondering this for a while and can't find a concrete answer. Will there be RP-PVP servers in Classic? I've heard some people say yes and some say no, none really giving evidence other than rumors.
---
Constant complaining and people asking for changes actually reminds me of vanilla lmao
---
What days/how many days a week do you think you guys would raid?
---
Warriors get send to the charred vale for their level 20 classquest. Definitly a though quest to get done.
---
If you want to count the faction as a racial then its undead.
---
Yes, as many as possible. If I could I'd have add-ons do everything for me. Level, socialize, raid, train skills, AH, you name it.
---
Themechanic and Zeroed are god-tier hunters.
---
Full disclosure here: I started very late in WoD but fell hard for the game and really regret not starting sooner. So I’ve watched all of Preach’s legacy videos and watch other content and read about “old wow” all the time. 
---
I’m *really*, **really** hoping that Classic influences the live game to make some real changes. Don’t get me wrong there’s things I enjoy about live or I wouldn’t be playing, but man some great things were lost over the years.
---
Make sure you stream this or send us your YouTube link of you and your guild clearing ony and mc within in hour in the first few weeks :)
---
Depends on class
---
Gnome warrior, rogue, mage &amp; warlock, NE hunter &amp; druid, dwarf priest &amp;  paladin
---
After travelling to the US west coast and seeing places like Yellowstone and Zion national parks I gained such an appreciation for this zone. Retired my mage from vanilla at Sun Rock Retreat, the obvious location for retirement choice.
---
yeah it not a official stress test but I'm sure something like this stresses servers somewhat
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/TsundereSpotlessSparrowCclamChamp
---
Chad class but if not an authentic well-performing Chad, you turn end up with a virgin Eugene reputation
---
Spoken like a true 15 year old.
---
Yeah it's kinda too bad that people ended up deciding (honestly, kinda rightfully so in a lot of cases) that the most useful support/utility to have is just more damage, I think the setup of tank/heals/dps/dps/support is a much more interesting setup conceptually.
---
Druid favorite, have never played a single second worth of Paladin and doubt I ever will.  Just doesn’t sound at all appealing to me.  It’s the only class I’ve never touched.
---
NE hunter over dwarf hunter?
---
Erm. Not really. It basically gives you a Multishot for free. You'll never get 2 Aimed in a row.
---
Paladin is the most boring class in the game in my opinion. Personally rank it the 9th out of 9.
---
Your kinda exaggerating it, you can get to about 5-6k before it's a hassle and anything above 10k is absolutely unplayable.
---
Awesome. Dragon charging into the horde than turning back on its allies, rip alliance.
---
&gt; arcaneshot burst
---
Arcaneshot does horrible damage
---
Horde should have continued the kite to UC instead of despawning it.
---
&gt; question: does multi shot do more single target damage than arcane shot?
---
Yes, by a solid margin. Arcane Shot is pretty garbage.
---
I was there, and sorry, but that's just bullshit. I hit like... 2 of my frostbolts and the vast majority of my wand spam too.
---
Mine would get about 600 crits from memory, cant wait to do that again haha
---
My all means, elucidate instead of just arbitrarily making claims.
---
how mad?
---
Not sure if it's why you posted this but this is exactly what Asmongold is talking about on his stream right now.
---
There's been posts on the official forum lately complaining about people kiting Teremus to Stormwind, people asking for a timer on WSG games because of HK farming, etc.
---
Asmongold said the same thing, these are the complaints that led to BFA. If you don't want to play Classic, don't play Classic.
---
Sun Rock Retreat remains my favorite town in all of WoW history, something about how it’s just tucked away in the mountains along this small pond just feels so homey.
---
This one is debated a bit.
---
Generally dwarf is better for world solo pvp, but in premade PVP the stealth is invaluable.
---
My guild disbanded at the very end of Vanilla, so I went my own way and switched from Alliance to Horde, and Warrior to Rogue. It was like a completely new game, and I was out there by myself clawing my way through this hostile world, making friends and enemies as I went.
---
I don't think that's because I was 12 years younger, either. It'd feel just the same now, apart from the fact i've got the memories of being a level 70 raiding Rogue, and I think it's because vanilla, BC and Wrath were Blizzard and WoW at the very top of it's game.
---
Cataclysm wasn't bad, it was still excellent compared to many MMOs, but it certainly began a very subtle downwards descent... almost undetected, really.
---
If you make enough noise on Reddit/Classic WoW forums; the devs take notice - which is good enough, for those without the beta.
---
It's not ideal; but it's better than nothing.
---
Lol keep telling yourself that, this happened all the time in Vanilla when a mob was leashed too far and dropped aggro.
---
Yeh warlocks were garbage because they didn’t get buffed till patch like 1.7 or something like that? I can still remember that warlocks were basically a meme class before the patch and all of a sudden one day going to kill one in STV and being like ‘wtf just happened a warlock killed me’.
---
People that use twitch speak outside of twitch should be permabanned from reddit

Overall trying to change the vanilla experience, I could go farther then the first page on the WoW classic forums and dig for more. Once it's released itself it'll cause so many more tears.

**&lt;Moonshot&gt; EU - PVP \[H\] |** English-Speaking **\***Semi-Hardcore-Hardcore**\***
---
Moonshot's core is a bunch of people who've been playing World of Warcraft competitively for many years; some in PvE, some in PvP,  some on retail and some on private servers. Recently, and with Classic WoW's release getting closer, we've decided to join forces and start working on this project together.
---
**What are we looking for?**
---
Mostly, we'll be looking for \*\*hardcore\*\* players who are willing to put in the hours, and are looking for a place to both PvE and PvP in competitively. We will, however, also accept exceptional applicants who will be taking the game more casually or focusing solely on PvE or PvP. We are also looking for people who'll be willing to give a little extra; people who'd want to be Officers, Class Leaders, Raid Leaders, Premade Leaders, and people who possess any skills or talents that'll help our guild and the community grow.
---
Our goal is not just to be another top tier guild, but to also nourish a powerful and enjoyable community. 
---
**Raid Times**
---
We'll be raiding 2-3 times a week (20:00-24:00\~ European ST) | Loot Council.
---
Days are not yet decided and may vary.
---
We'll be forming BG premade groups mostly during the weekends and on evenings we won't be raiding. WE WILL BE PUSHING RANKS.
---
People who'll be willing to join some of us on the PvP Rank farm once the Honor System is out, will be welcome to do so, and those groups will not be limited to weekends and non-raid weekdays only.
---
We are also planning to partake on the organization of various Arena/Dueling tournaments with awesome prizes.
---
Further information can be found on the Application Form at the first section. 
---
Feel free to share this link with any of your friends who're planning to play Classic.

You can hit us up on Discord for any further questions @ **Moonshot#0849**

I logged into my old vanilla toons looking for inspiration on my main for classic. Found a level 11 gnome with just over 2 days played on him. I remember playing him for so long. If I was asked I would have sworn he was at least level 40.
---
[Awkward...](https://i.imgur.com/kPqvjqP.png)
---
Would rather have a gnome warrior for escape artist instead of stoneform.
---
You can enjoy classic for what it is, without small quirky "features". It doesn't have to be one or the other. I can surely enjoy classic as it is, I love it very much. But that doesn't mean I can't want to remove some of the qurkiness for an overall improvement instead of being stuck in the ways glorifying what was a great, but not perfect game
---
For the last time, IT WAS A GREEN SHIELD. Will I not stop copping grief for this, just let me go pvp
---
Really rounds out the “classic WoW” experience
---
Currently looking for an Alliance guild (casual or semi-hardcore) that aims at having a member cap (quality over quantity approach). Before I go further I just want to clarify that big guilds are completely fine; However, I personally much prefer the tight-knit atmosphere of a 50-60 man capped guild where everyone knows one another. I've been a part of both and there was always something that I enjoyed about raiding with the same people every week and growing as a team element instead of witnessing clicks and the like. I understand that a guild like this is not the norm and will probably be difficult to find, which is why I am casting out my line in the hopes that it reaches a guild with a similar mindset.
---
About me: I'm in my 30's and I currently work from home so raid attendance should pose little to no issue. At first I mained 2h fury but eventually moved into resto druid which is what I plan to main this time around with alchemy/herbalism as my professions. As for raids my experience stretches from MC to the first half of Ahn'Qiraj. In regards to pvp I maintained the rank of Lieutenant General during my time in vanilla. I've been in leadership roles before, but I much prefer following directions rather than giving them out. I always try my best to excel and come prepared with consumables and ready ahead of time. I know when to be in a relaxed and chill mind frame vs being serious for raids. My plan is to play an excorbinant amount of hours that I can to obtain BiS pre-raid asap, consumables and the like while helping out others along the way.
---
Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Please feel free to message me if you would like more information or fit the criteria.
---
Well I was young. Didnt read nor take every quest. Sometimes I spent hours just running around all over azeroth looking for quests
---
Yeah, it's a reason why to an extent. Decided to read the first page of the classic forums. Cry babies are the reason WoW is the way it is today.
---
Lol silly. You forgot we already did it once! We're going wayyyyy back.
---
Lots of people go to school for 15 years...
---
Also i thought humans were the best warriors
---
Yeah from a lot of experience it’s the opposite of garbage. Was one of the most OP things I ever experienced playing WoW. My hunter had top tier gear so that definitely played a huge part but still back then not many players knew about this trinket and were surprised to get bursted down by a MM hunter.
---
&gt; Dwarf Warrior
---
Why? Gnome is just better for PvP.
---
&gt; Night Elf Rogue
---
This is just.. Wrong. Nelf Rogue has legit 0 racial-goodies. Gnome, Human, Dwarf. Human is insane for Pve.
---
&gt; Gnome Mage
---
I could live with that.
---
&gt; Troll Mage
---
Could you elaborate on Troll &gt; Undead as mage
---
&gt; Forsaken Warlock
---
How? Looks? Sure. Orc Wlock &gt; Undead.
---
You actually have a reason or just blind dumb hatred of someone you don’t even know?
---
It lacks graveyards for horde, so I go there as little as possible.
---
Probably not many, but I would say it's their best shot at topping any kind of boss.
---
Maybe Ossirian also, if he doesn't have a shit ton of dmg reduction like he does against spells. Can't remember if he does.
---
Are u playing on launch? If so, how much time are you guys commiting to it? Cuz the first two days are the most important to get ahead of the masses and reach a point where you can quest regularly, so if you guys are going full no life, imo it would be better to get lvl12 first and then meet up at Darkshore. Its the easiest zone for everybody to reach. Humans take the tram to IF, and from there you do the Wetlands jump, easy. NE would have to walk through it to Loch Modan.
---
That is of course assuming layering won't nerf the whole thing and make it seem there aren't 200 ppl trying to tag the same mob. If so just go meet wherever, its all the same.
---
The ony attunement chain as someone else posted was really great, I always liked LBRS/BRD just as thematic instances, and the quests associated with them.
---
The quest that ends with the Fordring's Seal reward was pretty awesome, but I believe that's available to both horde and alliance.
---
Did you play the stress test? Was almost impossible for melee to tag a single mob, I tested it out by not grouping and it literally took me over an hour to do the kill 8 kobolds quest. It was not fun in the SLIGHTEST.
---
Seems fine to me?
---
I swear to god I must be having a senior moment.  I thought this guy died?   Must have been a different wow video creator...yes?
---
Pallies. They can perform every role in 5-mans, and they have unique strengths and weaknesses. AoE tanking looks like a blast, as does AoE leveling. Holy is so damn efficient, and you don’t turn into spirit goo when a mob looks at you and breaths in your direction. 
---
I’ve recently played Druid on a server known to some as Horse-Tail. I only got to 58, but i would never do it again. Been there, done that. The tanking feels really bland compared to the other 3 options. The healing is the weakest in the game. World PVP is a blast as a Druid, so maybe I’ll make a Twink. But I have zero desire to level or raid as one.
---
That's fine. I'd rather not be friends with someone who mouth breaths like Asmon. I was just stating an opinion, no need to get offended friend.
---
Finally someone with some God damn common sense in this SR
---
Sounds like your motivations are misguided.
---
They are all fun honestly. A well played paladin is the most powerful group pvp class in the game. Shamans are pretty decent healers and good in pvp. Druids are among the fastest levelers, can dps, tank and heal. I'd play them all.
---
y wont blizzard protect us from having to buy $3k+vanilla CE's from 3rd party sources to get CE pets in classic?
---
The 3 full raids had fun. It was a fun experience.
---
&gt; Probably not many
---
Mumba, the hunter in that raid, has half of the Rogue's DPS. And he's one of the best Hunters you'll find in Vanilla. He got all the way to the Kel kill. I'm gonna say 99.9% of hunters wouldn't get 400 DPS on Ony.
---
Rouge
---
But they are boring to lvl with
---
This is why they're doing so many stress tests. I'll admit I was a bit disappointed they didn't open it to the public tho. I hope with later tests they just open the floodgates and let everyone in to get a true gauge for player interest.
---
Just imagine swimming in all that energy, enough to pour into backstab after backstab after backstab... as long as you didn't mind getting slapped by that tail, ouchies
---
That's good I'm glad. I'm excited to play it. I just don't like what streamers bring to the table for games like this.
---
When we're they removed in vanilla? What if they gave people ample time to level and buy them?
---
Were you a European playing on an NA server?
---
Really nice!  I made a similar map for Civ 4 but smaller in scale - was years ago though so no idea what ended up happening to it.
---
Meh Preach
---
Hmm haven't seen that strategy. I think there will be a lot of trial and error on Classic. I hope some things are different. Been playing on private servers for 3 years now.
---
Aggressive?  I guess...
---
so much cringing
---
spent days fighting bears with resurrect sickness and thinking its the hardest game ever. then some high level friend came to see and told me im doing everything wrong. then i went to westfall and finally started to  learn
---
Beautiful!!
---
Hunter. You'll get significant control over every situation and it's easy leveling.
---
cry babies are why retail went to crap.  
---
No changes! :D
---
Probably the very first time a classic raider found a green 50 feet inside the dark portal that had 10 times the stats of his old piece in that slot.
---
What you don't like skinning your victims like Buffalo Bill from Hannable and wearing their face as a helmet?
---
A true druid I see.
---
it's just that everyone who had aggro died
---
Same lol. It's baffling
---
For PVE sure, but not in pvp not by a long shot.
---
I recently saw a private server hunter pvping in WSG and getting off 2 aimed shots in a row with this in almost every encounter
---
&gt; went down fast
---
&gt;I missed it
---
????
---
It could had been. At this point I can't recall all the specifics. This was always in battlegrounds I should add, open pvp was trivial usually. I have never done engineering with the warlock I always went tailoring or alchemy, however I'm thinking I'm going to with my warlock in classic. The possibilities are endless! The hype is too fin high!
---
I think what he’s trying to say is that it’s unfortunate that people cannot see past their preconceived notions about classic and will miss out on potentially great fun.
---
These are the videos that make me excited for classic. I want to feel like I’m playing back in 2006 again.
---
Im assuming its a meme, because we did this shit 14+ years ago?
---
And people are all ready complaining about it on the WoW forums
---
They catered to players who don't enjoy the game at it's core. If you don't enjoy investing time to advance your character and the satisfaction and interactions with players that come with it then you don't like wow. Don't change the game to fit players who will never enjoy it. All you do is alienate the fan base you already had.
---
Leveled to 30 as prot... No wonder I abandoned that toon.
---
Wtf dude the giant stalker set with lok’delar staff looks amazing, dragonstalker too!
---
And a downvote complainer. Goodness.
---
I mean, Soul Link helps you not die and that's basically all it does. So for survivability it can be a boon, it just doesn't apply often in raids.
---
PvE farming mobs and such it can have its usages.
---
Okay yeah but the literal God is Asmongold
---
Why in the world would the enemy not interrupt the second Aimed? I get the first, trap, but the second?
---
Oh Light. Oh fuck. Bolvar's got air pods in. He can't hear the dragon.
---
Just get extra sports in the week before, then you'll have more WoW time, genius. :)
---
But didn’t chaos bolt go through the bubble? Or was that not Vanilla?
---
Yeah I've never heard cuck outside of twitch
---
Seems like you're getting mad from deliberately misinterpreting everyone's points because you want to show off how much of a badass you are for playing against "top premades"?  
---
I've never played against top premades, and probably never will. Neither will 90% of the entire playerbase. All I said (and many others) was that ret is "pretty good". Not that it is optimal, not that holy/prot is crap, just that it is decent. It is viable because in classic as your toolkit is class and not spec based, so you could heal with ret if you wanted to. If you tried to heal as ret in BFA you'd be laughed out of town, but you can do that in classic and do fine. Maybe not at 2500 elo, but just fine for most players. At that point, it comes much more down to personal playstyle and choice rather than eeking out the extra 5% benefit to fit a strategy your premade has perfected.
---
Think about all the things you've proposed - they all require a lot of teamwork and coordination to pull off, which is not the environment most people are playing in. Sure, holy/prot is top tier, but that doesn't mean ret healing is as bad as you claim for people who aren't pushing GM/HW. Actually, for the majority, holy/prot would be the "meme spec" here, because you're just blindly copying what a team with much better coordination and teamwork would do without thinking about if that spec could work without having 9-14 other top tier players on your side.
---
So yeah, I guess I did "give myself away" as someone who hasn't spent the past few years playing vanilla private servers, not that I was pretending to be an expert in the first place. But you gave yourself away (and continues to do so) as a colossal asshat by claiming the only way to play is at the top tier, and by shitting on everyone who doesn't do so. Chillax, cool it with the "I'm top tier premade" e-peen, and think about people who aren't yourself for a change.
---
Hunters have harder time if they're attacked (while Rogues have Sprint and Vanish and Blind), but nothing can beat them if they attack. Hope this helps.
---
Add some pre- and post- 1.12 touches could work.
---
Such as make /sit work with talents that activate on crit, weapon effects that scale with spellpower (but with a lower ratio) and so on.
---
Enough of a challenge to keep you invested and make it feel like an accomplishment when you got gear and a level
---
I’m pretty sure judgement isn’t too worth it anyways. Perhaps, maybe if you know they’re gonna be incapacitated at some point, you can drop a SoC judge for meaty damage, but I think it’s peak efficiency to judge as little as needed.
---
Shaman "all types", Jesus class confirmed.
---
And here we see a banned redditor using his old throwaway account to talk shit
---
Do you know if he is Turkish? He looks like a turkey
---
Feel free to check my comment history; I frequently make fun of people who shit on streamers for no reason. In fact this is the first time I’ve ever criticized a streamer. But sure, call me “jealous” and keep embarrassing yourself with ad hominems.
---
 He fucked up by rolling need. That’s why he reacted the way he did when he realized it. That doesn’t make him literally Hitler. Nuance is allowed here buddy.
---
this guy is so Pepega
---
I was going to post a comment saying "OP said "deadmines" did you even look at the image before coming to the comments?" but then I realized you were referring to yourself as OP which is just kind of... weird.
---
They are both good.
---
There, now you have 3 conflicting comments in your thread, OP :)
---
MRRgrrllgrrllgrrlllgrrlll!!!
---
I don't think changers are anything but small minority at the moment. Just read the threads, the various "no" and "go back to retail" get all the likes.
---
can't wait to stick the epic dagger to someones liver)
---
Yep, would pay up to 500 $ just to get Beta. But nope they dont want. I even run 15 Subs atm.
---
I actually noted that it is likely that the Dragonkin there were nerfed before TBC, because the last time Thottbot had noticed them was in 1.11.2:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btrlcg/how_come_all_the_green_dragokin_in_swamp_of/ep1wek6/
---
You will use a fucking shitload of shards
---
Same effects. Whether it be cross server or not doesn't matter. It's splitting the community and divvying up the player base. Just like sharding.
---
You can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig.
---
You aren't going to use an airplane to extract someone from a remote mountainside.  Just like you aren't going to use a helicopter to transport goods/people from the US to Europe (or vice versa).  How they fly is the main distinguishing factor in why one is chosen over the other.
---
I leveled a warrior, rogue and shaman to 60 in vanilla and warrior was pretty easy. I leveled as fury and it was pretty quick.
---
Loot Trading in dungeons. I made so many posts and comments about why I hated the idea of it, and I never expected Blizzard to budge like they did. I still would prefer no loot trading in raids, but I was surprised we got the compromise we did.
---
Total Biscuit maybe? Another Brit albeit totally different accent.
---
Are you asking like it isn’t a thing? There are haste enchants.
---
This is blizzlike. I remember having over 100 ping back in the day doing the safety dance on heigan and you would have to move ahead of the graphic because due to latency your character was actually 5-10 feet behind where they were on your screen.
---
So many people would buy into it that it would still be a lottery. Just instead of a $15 lottery it's more expensive
---
PvP can't be minmaxed. PvP is situational.
---
Nah
---
Two moons.
---
Two factions.
---
Yeah I’ve made a list of all the zones level brackets and made a route for questing, and Stonetalon is number one on the “to be avoided” section, along with Northern Stranglethorn. Booty Bay/STV should be better, but I mostly want to avoid gankcity and poor questing zones.
---
I’m probably doing Ashenvale though which makes that a moot point, but I like the asethetics and it’s not that bad since you have flightpoints at the troll village and in the east.
---
Most people are around 30 on the beta.
---
Love shaman - wish I was good at Druid but can’t play one to save my life so I’d say that for the class I wouldn’t play
---
or maybe faction leaders were changed to not attack creatures in late vanilla patches ? idk
---
\&gt; Changing the difficulty of leveling/dungeons/raids.
---
Most people asking for those changes have been to make it harder to counteract the buffs and nerfed in 1.12 and increase of knowledge since then to actually make it more like vanilla was. If you are against having the same difficulty as it was and want things to remain easier, then maybe Vanilla was too much for you and you were one of the people crying to make things easier.
---
I have spend a good amount of time in the classic talent calculator and it’s shaman for me. 
---
The whole totem thing and ele/resto build really fits my playstyle. Big burst, good kiting, more than decent healing and great utility imo.
---
I wouldn’t play druid personally. Healing is hard and balance and feral are kind of lackluster
---
Nah dude vanilla was just easy 4Head
---
Akchuwally.... warlocks are below the power spike until around mid lvl 40s ( when they get access to deathcoil and certain talents), although if played properly can cheese 1v1s yet the class still remains one of the most immobile classes, which means their open world pvp values before mounts is pretty low , as you can't really run or chase anyone and you don't have much tools to help vs more than 1 class at a time and that is given you are both equally full hp ( and not getting jumped while you're killing mobs which is very likely).
---
Also in a freshly dinged 60 lock deals close to no damage, doesn't have the crit chance to go destro for pvp , doesn't have the spell damage/stamina to make dots kill something fast enough before they die, not to mention this also translates to lower mana pools = more lifetapping =  damaging your health more than you should and spending time tapping instead of doing other stuff.
---
Although it is relative to the fights obviously , I'm mostly talking about if you're fighting good players who know what to do vs a lock ( for example: mage decursing agony and buffing fire absorb would make most dot damage negligible , then using CS on hardcasts etc).
---
I don't wanna really wanna go in-depth but locks scale harder off gear than other classes (similarly to warriors), they feel clunky and squishy when undergeared but absolute monsters when you gear up.
---
Soul link builds aside ofc, unless you're mostly planning on pvping from the get go.
---
Please stop posting Asmogold crap.
---
best vid for classic. great editing
---
Looks like you have plenty to do while waiting on flight paths
---
I'm not so sure, I think there are plenty of people that want to try it when it comes out, I don't think there are as many that want to have money invested into it for months.
---
Actually pretty damn funny. Made me lol
---
My wife and I both plan on playing fairly causal, but finding a good guild on a PVE server away from the streamers and make some friends there. We both played back in vanilla, I raided ZG and did a few dungeons then, lots of AV and a mix of WG/AB, but was really clueless about the game then (pitty me, I leveled to 60 a ret pali). I'm looking forward to casual raiding/pug groups along with taking the skills/knowledge we all have into play on raids we have steamrolled thru on our retail mains or done in the past - and going back to what everything looked like originally, leveling with speed but not pulling any all-nighters (not that I could now), making alts for professions, and just enjoying the whole experience. I think the whole "journey vs endgame" is what I'm more excited about, hoping this might scratch the mmo itch that's been missing for many years.
---
I'm not opposed to that. No matter what the difficulty isn't going to be the same in a sense. Since players have been improved by a significant margin.
---
So you just happened to post this within 3 hours of [someone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btrez6/it_doesnt_matter_how_long_it_takes_you_to_get_to/)?
---
🤡🎮
---
No. I wouldn’t. It’s just a beta. You people put WAY too much importance on getting in to it. More than you do actual release.
---
MoP was my favourite as well, I really love the Chinese setting and themes. But most importantly the classes were extremely fun to play.
---
If the bot is offline it is likely due to my own ignorance. I am in the process of moving and had accidentally tripped on my mess of wires unplugging my router and server. So it likely needs to be rebooted.
---
Your source is a piece by lawyers attempting to solicit customers. This is their explanation of why "If you don't take adequate or sufficient, reasonable means to protect and enforce your IP, then you run the risk of losing your IP rights. *What is sufficient and reasonable action is not always clear; it depends on the situation.*" aka we don't have a good explanation for why you *have to* protect your IP because the real explanation would tell you that you really don't need to worry about it as long as your product isn't so successful that it becomes a worldwide hit that is synonymous with a generic product. Lawyers financially benefit from getting customers to send cease and desist letters, they're not a good source and they give zero explanation for why you have to or in what situations, they're purposefully vague. A neutral explanation divorced from a specific law firms website trying to get customers would be good, but not a dumb article trying to get people to use their services.

---
well ive already paid for a failed chance to get in so...
---
It said I should be 60 around mid september on my rogue, that half month off of work is my savior
---
Stinetalon and thousand needle are the worst vanilla zones in the game in my opinion.
---
I think these are two different things
---
$0.20 has been deposited into your bank account.
---
And a few months after that you became a God among men
---
I’m going Mage/Pally. So I can roll Tailoring/Gathering (maybe herb) on my mage, and Enchanting/Maybe Alch on my Pally. The Pally will be running more dungeons, so the disenchanting will be useful. And I can send excess cloth to my Mage for crafting tailoring pieces, and then I’ll send them back. 
---
I’m sure I’ll reach hangups at certain skill levels, but at least I get a free 40 mount on my Pally, so I don’t really have to be quite as wise with my money. I’d be more worried otherwise.
---
Yeah I would have been all over this.  Definitely would have been willing to pay $45-60 upfront, especially if I know I was gonna sub for 3-4 months anyways.  I'm sure everyone's disposable income is different but I wouldn't be able to justify much more than $60
---
based retard
---
If you're smart you can become a gold vacuum that sucks up everyone else's gold. Its easier to take gold from others players by exploiting certain opportunities than creating real wealth.
---
Elwynn stuff isn't directly connected to Defias in Westfall though..? In Elwynn, there're just a few quests about a "gang of thugs".
---
Everything before cata was better than MoP
---
I agree; well said.
---
Everything is subjective, and also relative. I've never played either of those two expansions, but everything I've heard indicates cataclysm was hot garbage. In your frame of reference it was a huge step up. Then add your personal experience to the mix. It's easy to see why you enjoy it.
---
As for which is better, that's subjective. Give classic a try and see what you think. I can guarantee you it's worth the $15 for a 30 day subscription.
---
it's been posted like 200 times the past month
---
go give asmongoloid $10 so he says your name on stream
---
Nothing is set in stone but Tuesday and or Thursday and Saturday around 8PM PST are looking like the likely days!
---
I can't Asmongold crying the whole fucking time. Does anyone know a less whinny beta streamer?
---
I also told my self I was going to make a mod like that back in vanilla. I never got around to do
---
Yes! I payed 5$ for the Beta in 2004 and I would do it again 15 years later.
---
Mop introduced thunderforging. Which was terrible for the game.
---
notice how that guy made it a text post to avoid the repost filter as well lmao
---
I used sword on my 1st warlock character. It looked cool and my firestone boosted its damage and made it look even cooler.
---
Warlocks were born to wield swords
---
I don't think this stuff scales with AP at all. The details on SP scaling are very interesting though.
---
If you spent a lot of time playing vanilla you are ready for a lot of crying from folks who didn't.
---
Hmm interesting, so essentially it's possible that they were nerfed between 1.11.2 and 1.12.2. 
---
I was essentially basing myself off of patch notes, since it's only in patch 2.3 ([here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0)) that it's documented as specifically nerfing elites between levels 1-60 so as to make leveling easier.
---
We'd really need Blizzard itself to check, since we have such limited information.
---
I made it all the way to 35 on my paladin.. and then I realized there was a tab at the bottom of my spec tree for protection and retribution.. leveled the whole way using only holy dps talents. I saw a paladin use SoC and asked him how he learned the spell... mind blown.
---
...until they leave stealth to kill a quest mob, then x1000 hunter's mark appear.
---
Yup, shouldnt take too long if we just do the dungeons for the quests only.
---
Shaman favourite, tried Druid on pserver but just didn't mesh with the class. Didn't have enough impact/power plays. It is probably the truest hybrid though.
---

---
I guess you would've had to experience it as it happened. For me, the game was all about community. The endless world PvP that would interrupt your leveling sesh with your friends and have you battling over whatever town/outpost was under attack at the time. The sheer expanse that was the game at the time - I had never experienced an MMO so it was amazing to see these places I heard tidbits about from the warcraft games in person. The reputation you carried on the server or on the forums. People would know you, they would hate you, and they would love you. You would know people from the other faction and interact with them. There is plenty more I could go on. MoP was kind of narrower, you could just quest and do your growing at your personal farm. There was cool content but every expansion after Wrath of the Lich king felt very de-attached from the community. There was almost no reason to interact with people. You could join a guild, do the raid, log off for the week and play other games. Sure there were people who interacted with you but it never felt the same way. I was able to get to know a LOT of people in Vanilla. In most WoW expansions you just got to know them enough to get through whatever you were doing quickly.
---
Just go look for some youtube videos of wanna-be streamers about Classic, OP.
---
Here you're just gonna get downvoted and get called retail scum. Some good soul might come and try to compare the two for you, but it will probably be a guy with rose tinted glasses thats been waiting for Classic for a decade.
---
I mean that's your opinion, I have paid $70 for new releases that have lasted less than a week, this beta is going to last for 3 more months as far as we know.
---
Mate I've played plenty of 1.12 warlock, I wouldn't have replied to him if I didn't have experience with the class.
---
Adal did engage in pve
---
fuck yes this is just what i needed for my discord server
---
thanks bro!
---
Is there a source where they stated they were going with the original models? I ask because I know EQ gave you option to view either old or updated models when they released their new progressive servers.
---
Lame! This shit is what made wow magical. I want mroe of it
---
Huh I didn't know that. Good *catch*
---
thanks carlos, I'm glad I have you around to help me when I am in dire need of a basic word of mouth explanation
---
You intentionally wipe the dungeon just because someone said advice that saves everyone a head ache in already one of the most hated dungeons?
---
Raiding hunters better start practicing now.
---
When you think tanking requires anything more than a 2h until lategame 
---
*insert april fools guy pic*
---
Those demands are obviously bullshit, but I honestly wouldn't mind making the game a bit more difficult as a whole to balance the experience of the years, would be a change but a welcome one in my view
---
Holy shit. Having limitations like this great.
---
&gt;Unfortunately this kind of stuff gets shut down in /r wow. People are telling me over there I shouldn't post this video there.
---
One person is telling you that while the rest of the comments are positive.
---
 It then wouldn’t we see realm transfers for high pop servers into new servers? They could remove layering with a high popularity situation by working to spread it out like they used to. Free hops to new servers.
---
Yeah, it's true. The fact that the non-elite variants existed before 2.3 implies that Swamp of Sorrows wasn't affected by that patch (at least, for the Green Dragonkin), so the time-frame is definitely smaller - making a 1.12 nerf feasible. 
---
I'm not Blizz though! I can only provide what information I have.
---
I would pay a lot for beta access.
---
What are those isles on 8D?
---
&gt; I think Blizzard is dramatically underestimating how many people will play Classic. 
---
Of course they are not.  Blizzard isn't new to massive launches.  Why are you saying Blizzard is underestimating anything at all?     
---
Why would you and other people see that it will be popular and no one at Blizzard could see that?
---
Good job though, any information is good information :)
---
Ret judgement and seal damage scales on spell power more than ap.
---
Or... you have a very dedicated healer friend that forces you to level in tank spec to be always ready for party quests/dungeons.
---
Ok ok so basically you can post whatever you want as long as there’s a golden retriever
---
I would pay for a years game time to get in, why? I know I'll play classic for the full ride
---
I think “saturation” is the perfect word here, for better and for worse. A tiny bit of saturation can enhance the original product while keeping it stylistically similar. But if you do too much, you end up misrepresenting and distorting the original piece. 
---
I think a small smattering of 5mans, maybe 4 or 5, a 10 man, and a 20 man would be the peak of how much room Vanilla has for more content. But I really don’t want to see Classic become bloated. Bloat is the biggest issue with the current game, and Vanillas pve content is well structured. I mean, Naxx guilds still run the first raid, MC. Having them use old assets and make old-fashioned pve encounters sounds excellent, but I don’t think it’s the ever-flowing wellspring if content some people want. That would lead to oversaturation real quickly.
---
I don't mind streamers but seems like you are just defending a guy being a jackass for no reason.
---
A) That doesn't excuse being a dick
---
B) Idk 
---
C) Idk
---
But one thing is for sure you don't just blindly need BOE's if everyone is greeding.
---
wut
---
How is a skull hitting for so little?
---
Dps wise no, SL builds are not considered pve specs , although you can mimic a weaker version of MD/ruin, just without the ruin ( which kinda gimps your dps tbh), it's certainly not optimal but can do in a casual raiding environment.
---
Fair point I can't really relate with low tier gameplay, also idgaf if I come across as an ass or not, no one who wants to win cares about that.
---
Regardless, even for casual pvp Ret will be horrible.
---
I don’t see any issue.
---
Herod is over 4 levels above Asmon and is therefore delivering crushing blows(150% damage)
---
It's mostly in anticipation for the massive launch game will ensure. Pretty sure blizzard has said they intend to remove sharding a few months down the road when the player populations level out and everyone is a little more spread out. 
---
Otherwise we will get excessively long wait queues to login in and 5000 players in Elwyn Forest all trying to compete for the same quest items.
---
Sorry, I should have expected that Alliance cucks would get triggered so easily LUL
---
No one in their right mind was worried Blizzard would shard different servers together. The people who spent a week and a half reading about the *difference* between sharding and layering are retarded.
---
No it's not. Npcs would attack anything that came nearby.
---
Druid/Paladin tanking is good in dungeons and acceptable for easier raids. It is completely nonviable though for AQ40 and Naxx, so if you have aspirations to do those, then roll a warrior.
---
But with the games industry the way it is you'd be paying 30+ dollars for a beta
---
People on /r/classicwow prefer classic wow?
---
&gt;I find it believable that the Green Wyrmkins were actually nerfed during the end of Vanilla.
---
Why? I find it unlikely. What would be the reason to do that in 1.12?
---
Retribution seals stack at different ranks too.  It was in vanilla.
---
It's a meme not an argument?
---
I liked Tier 11 &amp; 18 sets. Tier 3 minus hood looked decent, but by then most mages would be fire so the ice theme of that set kinda ironic.
---
Appreciate it, thank you, I really am thinking about doing it for meme value, but also to say that I am specced prot and see reactions for leveling dungeons haha
---
rofl that's hilarious!
---
Nah you can post anything that abides by the subreddits rules, ps he's a labrador :)
---
I love Hobbs!
---
The layering kind of messes with this though.
---
Hopefully it is removed quickly after launch.
---
I really liked the way he described retail. "RPG Simulator" is very very accurate. It does in theory seem like an RPG but it plays nothing like it. The fact that RPG elements such as the development from struggling adventurer to honorable mortal soldier has been traded to instant god or that professions are basically gone or indifferent is not a proper RPG.
---
Then add sharding, increasingly bigger world for decreasing playerbase that also dont travel etc makes it even less of an MMO.
---
So its neither really an MMO or an RPG in gameplay. While Classic brings that and the best version of that we've ever had in its genre. 
---
Age wont matter. The concept and gameplay is just so stupidly good that the experience is gonna be top notch even by todays standards.
---
Well..I’m a fan. Not the guy running blizzard. So I guess I’ll keep thinking like one, lest I turn into someone who thinks he knows more than he does.
---
For now I’ll go off of what the company said—which is that they are open to creating more content in classic.
---
He 100% did not. Maybe on a private server. In TBC, I've had the (displeasure) of seeing Fel Reaver kited not once but twice to Shattrath and both times neither A'dal nor Khadgar were touchable.
---
They fixed leashing of world bosses. Kazzak is especially bad since he's impossible to kill due to the self healing.
---
living community that's really important in every mmo
---
Wait. He actually had a shield?
---
Yup. The game plays like a single player game with a forced player-character narrative now. 
---
Can’t wait to be a nameless adventurer again.
---
Yeah the 20yard (obviously exaggerated for those who will harp on this) tauren melee attacks mean nothing as well, mind you they were done standing still so the server didn’t have to guess on location of the player vs client side location
---
I'd personally recommend rogue. Hunters are best on paper but because rogues always get the drop on someone and are perma stealthed outside of that it basically means you always win because you always choose winning battles
---
Bolvar knew what would happen to himself if dragon fire hits him.
---
There are only so many spots for the beta. It would end up being g outrageously expensive or it would just be a more expensive lottery. This is the only fair way to do it.
---
I would buy staves just to see if they looked better than mine
---
Sharding is still on and a lot of stuff which people think layering did actually was still turned on sharding. During stress test they were testing, turning on and off, changing settings - TESTING.  
---
3 months left till release, it will be different because:  
---
1. They will improve it out of gathered data during stress tests.  
---
2. Sharding will be turned off by that time.
---
by "vanilla behavior" i mean player behavior.
---
determining that the guards do not attack is in fact what "testing" means
---
And I really hope you'll limit your bandwidth, buy a PC from pre-2004, use a CRT, and they remove support for newer machines.
---
Somnus is a level 62 elite. Elite's appear to be weaker than they should be on the classic beta. I have a friend and former raid lead on pservers testing it and it is way to easy mode according to him. 
---
Put on your tinfoil hats for this one but I believe they may be dumbing things down on classic wow to make the game more accommodating to a larger player base. I notice a lot of things are much easier than on any private server I have ever played on.
---
Someone give this man an award
---
Shadow priest is actually better early than later. They don't scale well. Warriors are still pretty. Any caster is good early as well. Paladins are absurdly powerful at any point.
---
"Classic is just a better Video game". Case closed your honor.
---
I wouldn't know the reason, but with how ALL the Green Dragonkin mobs' elite forms appeared to disappear after 1.11.2 and hadn't been seen within the timeframe between 1.12-2.0.12, and how Blizz's data has them non-elite, I can believe that they were nerfed during 1.12.
---
The only other thought I could have is the TBC prepatch, but that'd require no one to record ANY of the Dragonkin elite forms during 1.12's lifespan - that I find more unlikely.
---
"I didn't even have time to put on my make-up!"
---
Layering is lipstick on pig which will be washed off after some time (No layering at Phase 2)  
---
Sharding is like tattoo on lips.
---
It's a 110/120 on average for me from Europe.
---
I was single and in college 15 years ago. I’m married with a 2-year old now. All I can say is thank god my laptop can run Classic since there won’t be as much time hidden away at the computer desk but there’s plenty of time for some farming or leveling in the living room while the family is just hanging out. Now if we could only get it to work on the Switch haha.
---
Sorry but your question isnt obvious 
---
It also doesnt matter on beta or not.  AP doesn't increase the judgment and consecration
---
&gt; Blizzard isn't new to massive launch fuckups due to underestimated player counts
---
ftfy
---
I say that's a solid idea. I support the idea of allowing people to look through the posts they want to see without having to see tons of other posts that don't suit their interests.
---
You can't expect them to be in a healing/tanking spec, but they should have healing and tanking gear.
---
