You brought it back in the day yet it still has it’s zip tie and plastic wrap around the cord to this day?

---
You could set your character level to 19, 29, etc. now which I think should do what you'd like. Are there other things you'd like to see for better twink support?
---
ideazon z-engine broke permanently for windows 10 back in Oct 2017? Steelseries cut all life support - I swapped to a dedicated razer game pad at that point.

The post is in regards to warcraft reforged being the perfect time killer and lead into WoW Classic. Not just talking about qarvragt reforged but how playing it would set the mood leading into Classic.
---
THANK GOODNESS TROLLS BECAME HOT, EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE HOT. PLEASE MAKE HOT FEMALE PANDAS AND HOT FEMALE TURTLES PLEASE.
---
no, my logic is "since I'm a part of this group, I deserve this reward just as much as anyone here does" the reward isn't bound, and therefore a large chunk of money is just as useful to me as the warden staff would be to that druid. because I could use that money to get just as much of a BiS piece for myself as that druid could.
---
mmo razer mouse (12 button naga) was years after the original ideazon z-boards and merc hybrid gamepad keyboards.
---
WHY did they not go with that character select screen. It's so epic looking
---
\- Don't have to deal with mana
---

---
\- Rage is slow
---
\- Combo points are cool, I guess
---
I'm a KT player since vanilla. These two guilds were the best. 
---
Wowowow 10k in bear form buffed only with fort.

The group finder (not to be confused with the dungeon finder)
---
**EMOTE**
---
As a Paladin I got my first companion pet, and saw Hunters with their pets, and was confused as how to get mine to fight mobs like theirs lol.
---
Dude I just said it would be a loot rule we would agree to before the dungeon. I played in Vanilla and that’s how a lot of groups did it because the money from some of those twink BOE items can help get you towards a mount or upgrade you could use. No one could be trusted to equip it right after winning. A lot of times the person that could use it would just go sell it because of the value. I think it’s fine if everyone agrees beforehand I don’t see what’s wrong with it.
---
I calculated WF based on proc % as a modifier to every hit.
---
Not really. Unyielding maul is very easy to get and is 99% as good as warden staff, so even a dedicated bear will make better use of the cash.
---
Why did you switch hands for the mouse?
---
Yup , I did . Right  out the packaging mine was a dud , so it sat on a shelf and looked pretty for awhile ! xD
---
Jesus Christ did you ever play classic. There isn’t a single spec that had more than a 3 button rotation. Most top specs were 1-2 buttons and a few once every few minute buff/rebuffs. 
---
Who the fuck needs 12 mouse buttons? Someone with a small dick?
---
J'ai le même :)
---
This is classic. Do whatever you want. No one can tell you what class to play and how to play except you.
---
This. People rolling classes based on their experiences on Retro are gonna have a bad time in phase 1, 2, 3 and 4. The pvp meta for the majority of Classic is not what you will find on retro.
---
All rogue bg may well be the single worst bg group composition in the game.
---
Thanks! It is pretty cute indeed.
---
Vampiric embrace, mind flay? Shadow spells will never sound the same, thanks bro! Kind makes too much sense. “You do need not fool me priest, for I know you are secretly a shadow main” LULW
---
Hoggles... From labyrinth...gnome mage
---
I think you mean a lot of nelfs in the tree
---
What? No, not at all. You actually just mirrored my sentiment. I steer clear from microwaved foods and generally only cook with fresh ingredients.
---
I ressed a guy in Hillsbrad and then he got instantly ganked by a rogue, I saved  his life and we defeated the rogue together. He then said "gtg school" and logged out. Later  that day I got a mail from him, he thanked me  and sent me 1g :)
---
That sounds about right. Is the outside of the ring elevated?
---
That sells for like 5 copper or what?
---
Exp is slower in classic, already confirmed
---
I think it's interesting to solve class problems with items instead of balance patches. The game can be more dynamic when you offer competing (and often mutually exclusive) item solutions. 
---
I don't think Survival Hunters need fixing, at least if you mean making it pure melee. Blizzard pretty quickly realized that nullifying half a class' kit was a bad idea. It's a hard design space to occupy, because if you make a hunter that uses melee first and foremost, you've basically just made a warrior. At best the hunter class should mix ranged and melee, which turns out to be the optimal way to play them with melee-weaving. 
---
I also don't think Shamans need to be able to tank. I'd love there to be more tank classes in different armor types (Warlocks in clothe, Druids in leather, Shaman in mail, Warriors/Paladins in plate). However, there are too many hurdles to overcome to implement new tanks this late in development. Most classes have threat generating abilities for "tanking" in small group play, but that shouldn't be indicative of late-game role. 
---
Paladins, on the other hand, are a tragic mismanagement that they finally started to solve in TBC. In vanilla, I think the relic items were tragically underutilized. I can imagine solving tank paladins pretty easily with that librams: bare minimum, give them a taunt on use with a short cooldown on level 40 class-quest libram. 
---
Then get fancy, because only a couple fights need a strict "taunt" function and mostly the Paladin's problem is threat generation. How about one that applies a 10 second buff to nearby (read:melee) classes that siphons some of their threat and gives it to the Paladin. What about another that converts healing received into threat. Messing with other characters' threat is an interesting mechanic, and one that has precedent for paladins in Blessing of Sanctuary.
---
You showed him!
---
But.. but... I want to! Better apply as CL
---
If you want to be efficient and good...be prepared to be bored...if you want to spam heal for epeen and overheal like a noob you will be bored. Pro tip heal hunter pets.... Dominate metres
---
Thats cute, undead warrior :3
---
I will be releasing indepth information about the warrior class close to around 3 weeks from now. Maybe it will change your mind..
---
Cute...
---
No, it's not for a paycheck, just asslicking. The guy spits in your face and tells you that you're stupid and that he knows what's better for you one year (J. Allen Brack) and then turns around and agrees to release Classic and all of a sudden everyone seems to forget where he really stands. It's just down to low self-esteem on these guys' part as customers. You should value your money a bit more and not settle for BS like that. It blows my mind how we're asked to pay full price for a re-release that struggles to even match the offering of the original product.
---
There will be far less GM staff, all replaced by automated garbage systems such as BoP item trading (???), right-click reporting such as in League where recently I found out "idiot" has now become a no-no word that gets you banned. Just take a look at leaked info from the recent wave of Blizzard employees being fired and you'll see what the conditions have become over there. Then you have these guys telling you not to be opposed to anything that Activision Blizzard throws at you because if you do, you're "ranting" and "raging" in all caps. *You should be happy you're getting to pay for the game! Consider it a gesture!*
---
Except for Tauren. They are too big and animalistic. And Orcs. Their women are too big and ripped. And Zandalari for pretty much the same reason. And Goblins because of how small they are. And Pandas because they are pandas.
---
It'll be faster for the warrior, but slower for the priest. 
---
Basically, the warrior will kill stuff pretty quickly, but not *twice* as fast as a priest can kill stuff on their own.
---
it's not being an asshole. I'm not saying I would suddenly do it when a BoE dropped, it's known since the beginning of the pull that BoEs are "All Need". I establish it at the beginning of a group right after someone is invited. if they have a problem with it, they can leave the group, no hard feelings.
---
if it dropped and I suddenly without any foresay decided that it was Need time, then yes, that would be quite asshole-ish.
---
Naw Zandalari are how Female Trolls should look. They just shit on the Darkspear design wise.
---
TourGuide will not work, it has been out of development since Wrath (Cata?).  
---
Having said The WoW-Pro guides never had an Addon, so when Tekkub discontinued TourGuide, they WoW-Pro repurposed TourGuide for their own Addon, which will be updated for Classic.

[Questie](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24994-Questie.html) will work, just a side note, if you continue playing Private Servers, try [PFQuest](https://gitlab.com/shagu/pfQuest), it's much nicer than Questie.
---
I don’t get the right side usage with using a mouse. ALL of my hotkeys were around WASD and combos of Shift, Ctrl and Alt.
---
It would look like retail WoW.
---
Twit tie, not a zip tie.
---
Haha, good luck!
---
After all the druids CAN posts i'm downright excited to have a druid or two as off tanks. Not having to compete with loot with the main tank, being far easier to gear up and having one available for the few fights where they are better as main tank? Fuck yea, ill take two please.
---
I approve! I've never been able to get into priest, but this makes me intrigued
---
Hey I don't want personal loot either. Its a good thing that people have to keep their reputation up. I'm only saying that some of what OP is talking about isn't that great of an idea.
---
People greed on greens because its a great way to spot the ninjas without risking the blue drops. That and having a bit of trust in your party is good manners.
---
Ill take it to the next level, I was dumb enough to buy just the cover. Figured 20$ was a pretty good deal for a sick WotlK keyboard, but when it arrived I put it in a drawer and never spoke of it again.
---
leveling is bad
---
Yep, as shown by this [potato-cam](https://youtu.be/eJM2S1DRGM8?t=95).
---
Propain - Warrior name always. Watched an episode of king of the hill with the name featured in it. Thought it was a nice play on words lol so I stuck with it.
---
Mageyoublink - Saw a troll with it on an old server, thought it was cool and stole it when I made a mage some time later.
---
Thanks! :)
---
And we can totally tank or heal anything even at the same time.
---
Wait, I get why it's like that to switch strafe icons to A and D positions, but what's with Z being in that top row? What is this madness?
---
I'd play a hunter over a warlock/mage any day of the week, they can be replaced by anyone that can press Fireball/Shadowbolt, good hunters make raids go 100% more smooth and heck they're amazing melee support classes
---
I ended up trashing the keyboard part itself but a month or so ago was helping my parents pack for a move and found my burning crusade one for my old aboard was nostalgic as fuck
---
Some say he's still exploring to this very day!

 0:00 - Adrenaline Rush + Blade Flurry (25 Energy) + Berserking   
---
Impossible since they are on their own GCD.
---
Your chance to have a Glancing Blow is:
---
    10% + (MOB_LEVEL * 5 - 300) * 2%
---
So against a Boss Mob, you have a 40% chance of a Glancing Blow. This cannot be changed with bonus Weapon Skill.
---
The percentage of regular damage your Glancing Blow hits for is calculated by a range.
---
The low end of that range is:
---
    130% - (MOB_LEVEL * 5 - WEAPON_SKILL) * 5%
---
The high end of that range is:
---
    120% - (MOB_LEVEL * 5 - WEAPON_SKILL) * 3% 
---
The low end has a hard cap of 91% and the high end has a hard cap of 99%. Your actual damage is a random roll between these ranges.
---
So this is our chart for a Boss Mob:
---
SKILL | LOW | HIGH | AVG | AVG REDUCTION
---
-----|---|----|---|-------------
---
300 | 55% | 75% | 65% | -35%
---
301 | 60% | 78% | 69% | -31%
---
302 | 65% | 81% | 73% | -27%
---
303 | 70% | 84% | 77% | -23%
---
304 | 75% | 87% | 81% | -19%
---
305 | 80% | 90% | 85% | -15%
---
306 | 85% | 93% | 89% | -11%
---
307 | 90% | 96% | 93% | -7%
---
308 | 91% | 99% | 95% | -5%
---
Anything beyond 308 Weapon Skill has no effect on Glancing Blow damage because you've reached the hard cap for the low and high ends of the range.
---
Herbalism/Skinning as I level. It just synergizes well and I'm not spending gold on anything. It makes no sense to me when people spend time leveling professions that aren't gathering when they level up it's a huge waste of gold. I will be banking all the cloth I get though.
---
That said, at 60, Tailoring/Enchanting or maybe Alchemy. I'm not sure but I know absolutely my first profession will be tailoring
---
They stand up straight, have slim waists and a human figure. If there was a human to monster scale then the needle would be pretty close to human for the female horde.
---
Made me chuckle. Lok'tar ogar! \^\^
---
Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the game.
---
Will people stop this shit after we’ve had 1 or 2 years of stale, imbalanced meta, so that we have more choice in how to have fun, or will you die on every molehill that comes up?
---
Rerolling over and over to find the right server/faction/race/class
---
I can only name my transmogrified armour... lol
---
So true. Even the “cool trinkets” I can’t even think of.

Take your time.

Read the quest text.

Be a part of the community.

That's basically what happens on private servers today. Less experienced guilds slog through MC and BWL then come AQ they hit a brick wall.

 No but I wish I had!
---
Horde have the Zepps and two FPs in STV. Alliance have the better city positions for end game content and don't have to deal with three different races all ending up in The Barren. Alliance have it easier for raids with Pallies, Horde has a lot of good racials for solo PvP.  
---
I'm going Alliance cause I want a saber cat, easy access to the cuter mini pets, and to flip when I jump. I am but a simple creature who needs to have all their characters on kitty mounts.
---
Oh wtf? Scatter to a trap for distance isn’t going to be so effective? What about the knockdown helm etc???
---
God I am so set on hunter, but they’re such a gimped class at times lol.
---
My class pick wouldn't change at all. The people who *need* to be the hipster classes are fucking weird to me.
---
Kralnor's Staff?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's a good one.
---
You know I was actually starting to theorycraft a 4th (level 35) character into this, because it really would make things easier. And I think you're right that flasks are likely not worth the extra work when it means taking a level 60's profession slot. I'm sure I can just trade herb mats to a guild alchemist if I really want to start using lots of flasks, and just tip them as necessary.
---
What do you think of the following four character synergy plan? Just a little modified from your original suggestion.
---
https://i.imgur.com/KLvnrHW.png
---
Probably the only downside of the plan is that if DM:Tribute works I could see myself light on mining mats, by not having a level 60 with mining. So I may need to pay my way to capping engineering on three of the characters in that case. However, if DM:Tribute is working, I'll be making 100+GPH, so that should be the least of my worries, right?
---
Is there anything you would change? Feel free to nitpick!
---
I have the Steel Series Merc Stealth. From I think 2008/2009 and I still use it today for gaming.
---
Thanks, now I don't need to keep scrolling down.

Back when Jeff was Jeffrey.
---
it's just a joke
---
I love its visuals, music, ambience, entrance, and lore. I just hate running it.
---
I had one and my friend spilled water all over it, so then I bought a second lol
---
in the same boat, going with mage because they just feel better at lv60, better in more situations and better QoL as you say. They can even be better levelers if your good at aoe farming
---
Agree but we get sos and the other flamesac farm near uld. We also get felwood spots and better decolace spots. Not to mention better stv imo
---
Are we there yet?
---
I remember the posse of Undead that loved camping that balcony in BRM. So well positioned that they can MC anyone on their way to BRD or MC and be just fine.
---
Ah yes, the pre-undead race!
---
Earliest 
---
Getting lost in Org. My sister was the one who got me into wow, but she was fairly new as well, maybe level 28 warlock. She wanted to give me some items or something on my lvl 10 something class. She said to meet outside the Den of Shadows. I said I was there once I got there, she said she didn't see me and said she was at the entrance. Turns out we both learned that day the Den of Shadows has 2 ways into it. 
---
I also ran around that city with the booming drums and it was blowing my mind games could be like that big and open. Only MMO I ever played before was GW1, and GW1 is far more limited in terms of how you could move compared to WoW.
---
Man I always wanted one of these before the razer naga was a thing/popular enough for me to know it existed. This is pure collectors gold imo.
---
That honestly looks like a terrible-ass keyboard.
---
I just know it feels bad to use and to type on it just from looking at it.
---
Yeah, you're wrong. :)
---
I've always shined in supportive and healing roles, from infusing in gw1, to enchanters in LoL. I play priest, because the biggest lost of dps is death and I'm good at preventing it (to a point)

---
this is bad mentality. The only time you will struggle to get hit is phase 1-2, when you are trying to get your bis items and start raiding. In phase 1 the most accessible/least competition ranged weapons will be guns:
---
Willey's Portable Howitzer (drop from strat) or if you have enough gold Dwarven Hand Cannon or Flawless Arcanite Rifle. The other option is Blackcrow which is highly competed by warriors, rogues and other hunters and Heartseeking Crossbow which is boe and does not give any hit. If you are a dwarf you can grab one of the guns, most likely the one from stratholme, and start raiding. Later after phase 2 you can change it to the bow or crossbow and use Biznicks 247x128 Accurascope to compensate for the hit you lost. You are not forced to use guns just because you are a dwarf and there are still some usable guns:
---
Blastershot Launcher (in phase 1)
---
Dragonbreath Hand Cannon
---
Larvae of the Great Worm
---
TRU DAT FFS
---
You should have gone with Feetish.
---
Costs a ton of mana yea. By the time you’re doing it, it’s on fights that are incredibly short and everyone overgears. And there are only so many fights where it’s ok to do, really, unless you want to be responsible for using 2 gcd’s on totems instead of saving someone from losing consumes and world buffs. I just wouldn’t consider it normal?
---
I've never encountered this, neither on vanilla/TBC nor on private vanilla servers. BoE was always greed unless you intended to use the item.

Shaman was my first 60. Chain lightning on AV bridge was so memorable.

OMG the 2012 comments are terrifying:

Q: "They just sit there for like 30 seconds at the start while the tank gets threat, did taunt not exist back then?"

A: Cos no one knew how to play back then!
---
Early classic raids are going to be fun, lol.
---
The time commitment is one of my worries. I'm an adult now. I can think I have two hours to run a dungeon and half way through i have to quit. Worried about that.

STUPID HYBRID TAX, WHY DOESN'T IT APPLY TO WARRIORS? THEY ARE BEST AT TANKING AND DPSING, IT SUCKS.

Basically how fast loot becomes obsolete or replaced.  Revolving door loot never feels complete or rewarding.
---
I see this remark in class discords all the time and it's the entire reason those discords have pins. Sure I could tell the 10th person in half an hour what the stat priority for havoc is, sure I could tell them what benthic gear to aim for and what talents to use, or they could click 2 buttons, find the answer themselves in half the time and not waste the time of other people asking dumb questions. 
---
Giving a fish vs teaching to fish type deal
---
Sure if someone has a genuine, in depth question that isn't literally the most basic thing like "which trinket should I use out of these two?" then people are happy to discuss and answer it, but brainlet questions get old really fast
---
^ This guy Classics.
---
They will be past the mass zero by level 5
---
In his tips for leveling, he mentions to always kill mobs on the way to/from quest givers. Maybe you just had a habit of skipping more of those mobs than he did?
---
I AGREE IT WILL REALLY SUCK TO HAVE THE SAME 20% MINIMUM CHANCE OF WINNING AN ITEM IN A 5 MAN PUG, AND IN THE CASE OF AN HONEST MISTAKE I AGREE THAT I WOULD RATHER WAIT HOURS FOR A RESOLUTION TO A PROBLEM I COULD SOLVE MYSELF IMMEDIATELY. IT MAKES ME FEEL SPECIAL.
---
I AGREE WITH THAT NOT GETTING YOUR WAY IS CENSORSHIP, DESPITE WHATEVER BOOKS SAY ON THE SUBJECT.

I sold mine :(

It's 3:20am rn in Germany and I can't fucking sleep 'cus it's still 29°C outside. Been at 42°C today. End me. I wanna be up late playing Classic, not sweating my arse off

About the game cards, here are some examples:

---
Can't 100% confirm it will work for Classic, but these have been out since the game launched, in 2004, so I'm pretty confident they'll work for Classic -- they say it adds game time to any WoW account.
---
Also, if he used game cards when he was younger, he might appreciate the teeny little extra bit of nostalgia that might come with them. That's how I used to pay for my gameplay back when I was a teen, as I didn't have a credit card. :)
---
Good luck, and nice of you to think of this!
---
They'd have good potential for offence, but man it would be hard to defend.
---
Id love playing WoW on WC3 engine, for real. Also a World of Diablo
---
Add to that the priest is going to want powerful anti-venom/restorative potions/jungle remedies to deal with Alzzin's poison, Enervate, which drains a shit ton of mana from the priest.
---
Yeah! I made a macro that when I pushed the orange button it triggered presence of mind, arcane power and launched a pyroblast. Within 2 seconds.

I still have my n52. Do you know if they will still work on windows 10?

No but wish I did and still had it. Even if I didn’t use it. I like to have memorabilia n crap from my favorite games 🤗
---
It was so bad. I loved it.
---
Everyone is saying buy one, but with the fresh server, will there be any? And would we be able to afford them when there are?
---
Its actually a 7 dps difference between trolls and orcs. Forsaken is the 83 dps drop
---
DO YOU HAVE SOME OFFICIAL BLIZZARD ANNOUNCEMENT WHERE THIS IS DESCRIBED, BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO AGREE WITH YOU, BUT IN RETAIL BOPS ARE ONLY TRADABLE TO PARTY/RAID MEMBERS WHO WERE THERE AT THE TIME ITEMS DROPPED.
---
I AGAIN WANT TO AGREE WITH YOU THAT CENSORSHIP IS ABSOLUTELY DEFINED AS NOT GETTING MY WAY. FREE SPEECH DEFINITELY IS ALL ABOUT FREEDOM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTIONS IN ANY PRIVATE VENUE. FUCK THAT JOHN STUART MILL GUY, AMIRITE?

PVP question: how good are locks at
---
a. 1-60 pvp
---
b. Early 60 pvp
---
c. Late 60 pvp without god tier gear
---
And by extension, are locks or shamans better option for the different situations above?
---
[This is the leveling strategy I'll be using:](https://wowclassicpriest.wordpress.com/levelling-1-to-60/)  
---
Wand Specialization (10-14) and Spirit Tap (15-19) are obligatory.  
---
Improved Shadow Word: Pain (20-21) for more dot damage.  
---
Then you go into disc to gain defensive and mana talents.  
---
22-24: Improved Power Word: Shield  
---
25-26: Improved Power Word: Fortitude  
---
27-29: Meditation  
---
30: Inner Focus  
---
31: Martyrdom  
---
32-35: Mental Agility  
---
The rotation looks like this:  
---
Power Word: Shield → Mind Blast → Shadow Word: Pain → Smite x1 (x2 if the mob is not at 50% health yet) → wand until the mob dies, gain Spirit Tap → Rinse and repeat
---
"At level 36 Mind Flay Rank 3 is now viable in terms of damage per mana. Respec to a shadow build, but hold off getting Shadowform until level 45 as you still require Wand Specialization to maximise efficiency."
---
10-14: Wand Specialization  
---
15-19: Spirit Tap  
---
20-21: Improved Shadow Word: Pain

The new rotation looks like this:

Getting lost in the dwarf/gnome starting area before I knew there was a map. My gosh, what a gigantic world it was for a short while. 
---
Don't get me wrong, the world is still pretty big, but....I can't really explain what it felt like to see the world as endless for a short time.
---
Accurate number of polygons lol
---
That's the one! We had one rogue drop in to make sure the damage wouldn't break stealth.
---
You only need to roll Greed once and watch everyone else in your party roll Need to learn never to do it again.
---
Looks pretty damn cool is it terrible or something?
---
I meant in terms of retail DPS discovering aggro management the hard way.
---
The journey is the game
---
don't rush the leveling
---
see the world, read the quest text, and don't be afraid of just exploring
---
love these original kills.
---
Because I think wall jumping is gone, but it doesn't stop people from finding ways to jump out of the maps
---
Greed is still useful for BoPs you don't need but would DE or use for offspec or some niche reason
---
I'll tell you this my friend. 15 years ago I started a Hunter because I thought it sounded like a cool and fun class. I didn't know shit about anything, talents, gear, you name it. And people kept saying hunter was shit yadiyada while I was leveling.
---
But hot damn if I didn't have the absolute best time! I loved my class and I eventually just learned to play it really damn well, not from any guides, just by exploring what I was able to do. I once got jumped but 4 (!) rogues out in the wild and I managed to best them, and I learned to be a valuable party member in dungeons with freezing traps, tricky pulls and whatnot.
---
Absolutely love hunter in every single way, and I'll be rolling it again this time around, can't wait!
---
This already happened and mobile gaming has already settled into its own place in the market next to PC and consoles. There isn't going to be another big explosion in mobile gaming.
---
I had the the OG and wotlk one and used them until they didn't work no more. Was a great keyboard.
---
It is the goblin way!
---
Much better than most will realize. Its really strong.
---
Lol, people were buying merc stealth keyboards for $300 before they killed off support finally, clearly there was a market for hybrid gamepad keyboards. But they still let it die. Steelseries bought ideazon mostly to kill them it seems.
---
Fair point. Although with threat meter add-ons it's not so bad. They buffed prot warrior threat in a later vanilla patch as well.
---
Yes, but off a very rare rare spawn I've only seen once in countless runs I did in Stratholme for Righteous Orb farming. And on top of that it's a 1 in 5 chance to get it.
---
If you want to go for Skul's farming more power to you, but I think you'll get Breastplate of Might before that chest.
---
Great spreadsheet there DarkPhenomenon!  For all those still looking for a guild, you should check out [Classic Raids](https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds), a Classic WoW guild recruitment tool.  There you can browse, filter, sort, and search for the perfect guild for you :)
---
This doesn't look just ready, this looks brand new! Have you ever used it? Where are the traces of all the meals you've eaten over the years? (well... or is it only me...?)
---
I can't get into how small and unimposing UD Warriors are and how bad plate looks on them. The whole "shredded" look is so offputting. 
---
When I think of Warriors from WC2-3, I think of male Orcs. They just have the look.
---
And from a gameplay standpoint, I'd rather have stun resist &amp; blood fury for PvP over any other racials so it all comes together for me. 
---
But hey, take my opinion with a grain of salt, 'cause I'm swapping sides and rolling a healer this time lol.
---
For a while during vanilla you could use a script to abandon your pet and that would rename it. I'm fairly sure it was eventually fixed and it definitely is fixed in Classic.
---
The amount of work required to get to 60 is nuts, what's the difference?
---
I agree with you. Make talent choices matter.
---
Thank god
---
Tanks are and always will be the lowest in supply and highest demand next to healers
---
Chain gang
---
It's definitely more of a raiding spec. It does 5% more than SM/ruin so it's meta
---
Find a decent sized Guild and you can usually find a sub.

Wanna do anything *well*, roll something else. (;

---
Xxlegolasxx
---
I just wish they would fix the pet command lag bug. Kinda ruins the class in my opinion.
---
You don't have to get it all the way to 300 while leveling. The iron grenades are super useful and shouldn't be too hard to get. 
---
From the trinkets, rocket boots and helmet might be tricky to get though and require a fair bit of farming.

Chaos and overcrowding

Or
---
Layering is overly effective. Smooth experienced
---
They just need defense right? No other glaring issues?
---
someone was roleplaying outside of RFD, which annoyed me. i was young and edgy so I typed "fuck off dweeb" and screen capped the chat bubble above my head. I thought it was the funniest screen cap ever. I came across it a few times in the years past, and always laughed at the simplicity. That screen shot is long gone now, but I will occasionally remind dweebs to fuck off.
---
I'm surprised to see good intention behind the title of this post. I sure hope more people do that. I got a lucky Edgemaster's drop recently in a BRD run as the only warrior and all of a sudden the entire group rolled need cause it's a BoE :D 
---
It should 100% go to the person that can use it if it's an upgrade to them. Otherwise, you're just being a scumbag imo. Rolling on chests has always felt stupid as well. It should get distributed based on needs, I always give away the mana pots and stuff, doesn't feel right to have it any other way.
---
Like I said, if it was a 500g BoP, would you roll need against someone who wants to equip it?  If not, why is a BoE that sells on the AH for 500g any different if someone wants in your group wants to equip it?
---
You (and a lot of other people) have just decided at a certain gold value it’s ok to take gear that drops away from someone who wants to equip it. When it comes to item drops in an MMO, that is literally the definition of “greed” and the entire purpose of the need before greed system.
---
Your dungeons are very impressive. You must be very proud. 
---
Seriously though, I love this. I really wish you'd make a "map editor" of sorts so anyone could make these. But this was super enjoyable and you're clearly quite talented.
---
Raiding Westfall a few hours into a fresh server launch
---
Best peice of advice I can give u TRAIN IN A RANGE WEP ASAP! You will need them for pulls and get use to using them.
---
Only really with good gear. With the mishmash leveling and raiding gear they just look awkward and doink, all hunched over with their jaw hanging down and spine somehow protruding through their cloak. Remember that you won't raid in T1 or T2, hell even T2.5 except head+shoulders.
---
20-30 years before Classic
---
We don't know if Realm Transfer will be available right at launch, just that it will be made available at some point.
---
We also don't know what the cooldown restriction on Realm Transfers will be. In Vanilla it was 6 months. In Retail it is 3 days.
---
Blizzard specifically named Realm Transfer as something they wanted to support because it was in Vanilla. They did not mention any other character services such as Name Change, Faction Change, or Race Change, so it is unlikely they will be made available in Classic.
---
The staff is so warlocky! I want it for the looks more than anything but the trinket is really useful too.
---
Mostly with you but divine intervention &gt;&gt; soulstone!
---
PST pics of keyboard for invite
---
Players will always be greedy.  Just blacklist and moveon, theres better things to worry about
---
I wish what you said was true and that there were more people pushing for the game to return in a more original state. To me, these issues are nothing but money saving changes for Activision at the cost of the game's integrity. It's about how much you're willing to put up with as a playerbase. If people don't respond to it they will keep pushing it until we get an in-game shop. It's that simple to me, I'm not being negative, I love the game and wish there wasn't a need for discussions like these.
---
Highest pve skill ceiling, imho almost every class is much higher skillcap in pvp compared to raiding.
---
It's not that useful, but at least it actually *is* useful for the entirety of the game where the staff gets replaced by DM and ST loot. 
---
The staff looks really good though so I kinda want it for the screenshot and filmmaking use.
---
Coil is for oh shit and for securing kills. Mages you generally just beat, priests are tough but doable (and dwarves have fear ward anyway), rogues are very hard anyway and warriors aren't very fearable unless you catch them in battle stance.
---
If you want to play lock and you're going alliance, just play lock! Fear is only one part of the kit. Plus you get to either escape roots or see rogues from 1000 miles away with felpuppy and perception as alliance.
---
You mean you didn’t preorder it last november???
---
Hey you're a phony!
---
[OP needing to redo the math](https://i.imgur.com/UaLpJOK.png)

I don't quite remember and I'm away from that PC right now. I think I just launched it and it worked right away.

And therein lies the appeal. Same reason people choose Wario in Mario Kart.

---
Yes, please. We need more tanks!
---
I had a rule where the guys who don't run to the instance pays for the healer's water. 
---
I never had mages in my groups for some reason so I don't really know what to do then. Maybe the slackers pass on greens. 
---
Another thing can be for the slackers to pick up all the shareable quests while the lock + two others make their way to the instance.
---
Maybe educate yourself a little and then you'll know why. A quick Google search will give you the answer...

I started playing shortly before BC. Logged onto my level 7 undead mage, in Brill. See that it's ON FIRE and being attacked by enormous demons. Thinking this was normal, I attempted to defend Brill. After dying a couple times, I "discovered" the zep towers and went to a new, mysterious land: Kalimdor.
---
And that's how I did basically *none* of the eastern kingdoms quests until late WotLK.
---
I haven’t read all of the Warcraft books but if your looking for something that technically happens right after rise of the horde, the last guardian is your go to. But I don’t think it really follows the same story. That being said there are many books that take places outside of the game. If you want something well before rise of the horse when the legion first came to Azeroth and started the events of the great sundering (when Azeroth broke apart) the war of the ancients trilogy is amazing. If you want something about a specific lore character, my favorite book is Arthas: Rise of the Lich King. And if you want something more horde centric/current there’s lord of the clans and of blood and honor.
---
For Ret they're pretty comparable since they both prevent a healer / OT dying, DI is trickier on main tanks IMO. Gotta remember, though, even though it's a neat trick to avoid repair bills, DI still costs 20s in mats! Warlocks got the Helltap for free.
---
I saw a post how the updates graphics invoked a Korean MMO style and it hit the nail on the head for me.  I’ll play it regardless but yeah I agree they should revisit the style they went with.  Nothing against eastern mmos but I think the distinctive wc3 is too far gone in reforged.
---
It is baffling we haven’t heard shit about this game though, such a missed opportunity not having this out before classic.
---
Get some sand for your tank?
---
Just an FYI, you may find more discussion at /r/Warcraftlore for this :)
---
Cool thing is for every person that goes undead that's 1 more 6 second hammer of justice they eat 100% of the time.  So when they pop wotf have your paladin friend stun then laugh as you burst them.
---
Conversely, I'd always had difficulty getting into a Forsaken character. What appealed to me about them was the tragedy of their existence; what with the Legion machinations and the enslavement to another's will they're basically the orcs 2.0.
---
At least until you actually play as one. I get that there are a lot of folks who enjoy being the bad guys, but there's too much mustache-twirling Saturday morning cartoon villainy in the Forsaken zones for my liking, especially the Apothecary quests. I'm hoping by taking my priest to Mulgore straightaway and leveling in Kalimdor instead of Lordaeron I'll be able to get into him more.
---
Poor multi target, stealth just slows you down, bad at stopping/finishing runners, no regen. Warrior is a lot more fun to level imo, even if I’d prefer to play rogue at 60. It’s more the gameplay than the actual speed/power, I’d rate hunter low for levelling fun too, even though they’re obviously very strong.
---
😢
---
Black Rock depths was the best 5 man dungeon ever made. Change my mind.

THIS IS EXACTLY HOW MY ZINGERS GO IN REAL LIFE!!!

"HEY GUYS, LIKE, GIRLS COME AND EPICS, no, shit, they THEY GO but EPICS are ^soulbound ^^^god ^^^dammit"

Hex does effectively the same thing for trolls except provided the 20% MS effect at rank 1. 
---
Shadowguard scales better than devouring plague. Shadowguard gets 33% of spell damage per orb and the highest tick of ZHC applies to the whole buff. Devouring plague gets only 6.25% per tick. Shadowguard also applies weaving, letting you start the fight at a high octane pace. 
---
A single application of shadowguard will do roughly as much damage as devouring plague once people are geared and have on use trinkets. Shadowguard will outdps devouring plague by a factor of 3-4 in a long fight. If you manage to get BiS, shadowguard can deal half your damage in a 1v1 fight against many classes, especially if both fighters are using bombs and allowing shadowguard's internal cd to tick down.
---
Undead are still neck and neck with trolls once you consider wotf vs zerking. Trolls make significantly better trispec and disc priests, though.
---
good, because I stopped updating my sheet months ago!
---
My best friend i played wow had one of these, was so bad.
---
Deep bro but so true 😓
---
You jest, but by telling the player to ask a guard they are giving them the ability to solve similar problems in the future. Telling someone how to answer their own question doesn’t make you a dick. Fucking Christ people are so god damn sensitive,
---
Maybe there's a third party who wants to make an open source version...
---
Support ends Jan 1 for Windows 7.
---
I don't have the keyboard but I die a little inside any time I play wow on a computer where I don't have my 12 button gamer mouse with me.
---
There's several addons that are already released and for which guides are currently being added/updated.  
---
WoW-pro, Azeroth Auto Pilot and GuideLime. More will be released later I assume, such as Joana's and Zygor, who have stated they will have it ready for launch (at least Zygor, not sure about joana).
---
Gonna main a lock this time around.. Best spec for dungeons? Rain of fire is nostalgia 
---
Also I'm very interested in a demonology hybrid build with soul link. Thoughts on best hybrid ? Thinking 20/31/0
---
&gt;I just saw a guy get his post removed because he linked a badass PvP video of some Chinese warrior on these servers none of us have tried and shouldn't talk about.
---
I mean... This is r/classicwow. It's for **classic**, not some pirated version of the game. Subreddits for pservers exist already.
---
How did you two communicate?
---
I TOO WILL MAKE A NIGHT ELF ROGUE, SEND THEM MY WAY WHEN THEY’RE DONE SUCKING “IT”! SHARING IS CARING.
---
LOL that's pretty funny. I spent the whole expansion climbing the raids prepping for icc... Eventually got into a guild that was farming icc25 and did 9 or 10/11, and lost all motivation bc I didn't have any new goals
---
Phase 1 which will last atleast 2 months will not have pvp rewards(vendors)
---
First person mode.
---
I think I have the insert lying around but not the keyboard
---
Classic didn't appear out of a vacuum. It's always the same people that defend shit like this.
---
[You seem mad](https://i.imgur.com/sFjtIOT.png)
---
Yes, by the time you hit 60 you'll know your class well enough to learn to be decent at minimum.
---
I had the TBC version but it was crap lol, I still loved it though haha
---
❤
---
Haha it was something where like the tank would collect stacks of something and once it got to like 10 the other tank was supposed to taunt cuz if the stack got to 11 it wiped the raid. And I lagged out at like 9 stacks. Got back in and then taunted right away when I still had the stacks. It was also like the top raiding guild on the server and this was my trial run. And I wiped their entire raid Lolol
---
That'll take a hour to turn around.
---
Perfect.  He won't even notice he' being back stabbed!
---
Someone gifted me the keyset one time but I didn't own the board so I never even used it.
---
We cant complain that only a select few got beta access while simultaneously condem private server footage.
---
I value skarms opinions more so than asmongold and skarm only has private server footage currently
---
Holy crap. The owner’s name was Gore, and he only got 4 years of probation for running a company illegally selling body parts form people donated to science. That’s messed up.
---
&gt;What can I expect going into MC as someone who has never healed?
---
What a silly question. You're gonna have 60 levels of healing 5mans plus lbrs and ubrs before you even step foot in MC.
---
Absolutely bought one of those. It was awesome..for the one game it supported lol
---
Wait what? Killing your self doesn’t do durability damage? Do you have to get the kb? 
---
So if a wipe is called just life tap til dead?
---
Finding something that compels you to be more efficient will speed you up if you aren't being efficient.
---
If you enjoy being efficient for the sake of it professions will increase your/played to 60.
---
Keeping skinning and herb while leveling personally, but I'm fine with a bit more /played b4 60.
---
&gt; shellfish quest
---
The what now?

👌👌👌👌

I went extra dumb and bought the keypad version when I mainly played on a laptop

---
I think google is the guy who answers the questions around here. Dude is such a nerd and is always online
---
Yeah. Just churn shadowbolts, maybe 1 dot on secondary or third target
---
Speaking from a low humidity perspective where it can get to around 50c, over 40 doesn't feel too bad.
---
After 38 your body pretty much gives up and just starts pushing sweat out at such a ridiculous rate that it doesn't feel too bad.
---
Now 32 to 36?  That just sucks.
---
This subreddit is kind of frustrating, but in the actual game players naturally stratify.
---
We don't end up stuck in groups with people bad enough at decision making to think this is a grand moral principle they are championing. 
---
And they don't end up in ours often either.
---
Why do you want to rush the levelling?
---
If u wanna do *any* dmg u need 10 points in destruction. The shadowbolt cast time reduction is basically mandatory. 
---
Hellfire for life!!!
---
could you please add 'green dragonscale gauntlets'?
---
yea i said that 
---
&gt;with greed roll priority.
---
The only part I can't remember exactly is the timing of the DE option, it feels like it was added later than the need/greed segregation.
---
I was either thinking that or level skinning and selling everything from skinning then leveling engineering
---
...and then wake up the next morning to find that they are up but going down ever 20 minutes.
---
The progression guilds do run 2 hunters max, and while people won’t blacklist hunters to the extend of what the post said, your mistakes will magnify and get nit picked on because you are a hunter. My advice is unless you are really good, really like the class, or run with friends, it’d be better to roll something else.
---
If a BoP in vanilla vendored for 500g, you’d be a fool to not roll need on it. Bliss would fix it real quick, however. Especially if it was an item someone would actually use.
---
Even if that item was bis for my class, I would vendor it.
---
You’re the one going back to previously discussed subjects. We will transfer. We did it when bc dropped we can do it again. A hardcore raiding guild would take that opportunity to be number one and leave a crowded server.
---
So I can level another alt.
---
Hunter/ Druid
---
Its exactly what you said. Madness on purpose. It's a french keyboard. Its AZERTY...Etc for a reason.   
---
Long time ago old typewriters were using ABCD keyboards , but french typewriters would type so fast that it would jam the typewriter and create a mess. So they decided to change it so it would mess with our brain and force us to type slower and not jam the machine.
---
Buying the 60% mount, then Blizzard reducing the cost a few weeks later. It's probably my only noteworthy "vanilla" achievement. Or maybe it was dual wielding the beast slayer enchant on my swords on my hunter.
---
I waaaaaas. I don’t regret it though. Had a couple other inserts that I used. It was a great idea, just subpar execution
---
Duuuuude I wanted one so bad as a kid
---
I don't see the need to rush why not just play the game and enjoy it . Only a handful of guilds will be good enough for anything end game .
---
I see you haven't heard of melee spell power hunter yet. I wish I was kidding when I say it exists.
---
I didn’t know that zf trick ty. Or the deadmines one but I didn’t do much dm
---
Just pwned ...sorry stonerboi
---
Play blind and enjoy yourself. Everyone that played vanilla did just that, and it’s one of the reason it became one of the most popular moms and popular games of that time. Don’t read guides, don’t listen to people, just jump in and play. Pick and class YOU want to play, that sounds enjoyable to YOU and play it how YOU want to play it. I envy you, I wish I could play this for the first time again, those were days I’ll never forget.
---
Yea I don’t see why not. Just make sure you make an alt with an alternative name that you like just in case someone reports you. My friend got the named Dbag reported after about 100 days played in vanilla because he pissed someone off in game. Haters are always around.
---
Maybe, but never understood why people go out of their way to say they smoke, noone cares lol
---
That's like hey man my druid is Marlboro drooz!
---
Meet my Pally HolyLiverdisease!
---
You can tell yourself it isn't being an asshole all you want, but the instant you do this you're on ignore, I won't group with you again, and I will talk the guy forming the group into taking me over you by telling them the story convincingly via /w. And I don't even care about loot in this game (not *one bit*), I just don't like the drama this kind of behavior brings to the table. Many people feel this way.
---
The hard truth about wow and grinding is that you will have nothing else to do.
---
I believe they will be using the same banned names data tables as they currently do for retail so you could test it there.
---
&gt; FUPA, saggy knockers -- like a witch about to boil a brew.
---
As we all know, the most crucial element of female character design is the saggy hairy boobs and a plump stanky FUPA covered in warts and zits.
---
It's the small details that can make the game.
---
Which is odd cause you can buy a potion in retail that lets you understand the other faction for an hour, but they still rage about it
---
WRONG
---
While I appreciate what you're trying to say, I'm not playing the wrong game. I like the grind, the grind is what makes this game appealing, it's just that in combat it's easier for me to stay focused on what's going on around me if I have buttons to press. I know there's plenty of downtime in wow, it's not new to me
---
Blizzard unrestricted names in 6.1, but the word stone only appeared twice before that in "firestone" and "kelstonebull".
---
I'd be fine with some server names tbh.
---
the real question isn't how much experience you have, but how much time you have.
---
it's just a video game. I'm sure you can learn how to tank well in classic if that's what you set your mind to. but if you take up the mantle of tank for a raiding guild, a lot of people will be depending on your attendance. will you be able to commit?
---
Weren’t some items for professions obtainable at vendors with long respawn timers? I think I remember that being a case but can’t remember which recipes were like that.
---
I have the cats edition and it still works good as fuck some of the keys are crusted together tho
---
Also added bonus for locks...for whatever reason they seemed to be the least played class on pservers and were always in high demand and easily got raid spots.
---
Obviously can't really know for sure how classic will go...but it's worth noting they've been in high demand for around 3 years now.
---
How?  No one is buying that crap.
---
THANK YOU FOR HAVING FAITH IN ME,I SHALL TRY MY BEST!
---
God speed
---
MC should not be the place where you learn how to heal. It'll take a long time to get to 60, so I'd suggest you heal every dungeon you can.
---
looks like shena - will spend your donation muny
---
WE SHALL BE NERVOUS TOGETHER
---
Half naked female dorf = win
---
Yeah it's probably hunter, especially if you have a slow ranged weapon and a 2h melee weapon. Can just hunters-mark, pet tank, then alternate between ranged and melee autos because they don't share a timer. Can generally use Raptor Strike off cooldown like this as well and it takes quite some time to dip your mana down.
---
Yeah, the keystrokes are just getting eaten, leading to crumpled variations on words. It happens when typing quickly. For example, "Robe of Winter Night" becomes "Rb Wn N" or similar.
---
Only mage and hunter can make real gold. Everybody else makes pittance
---
That's good news
---
To be fair, people not understanding how threat works was the biggest annoyance in dungeons back in Vanilla already. I don't think this'll be all that different from how it used to be. Maybe a tiny bit more annoyance in the beginning, but people carelessly pulling aggro over and over again has been a thing for literally as long as the game exists.
---
Meelee abilities are instant as opposed to long casting
---
Dwarf priest everyone will want a piece of you
---
That's true, I think I'm leaning towards hunter though as other people in this thread have suggested
---
Org is better
---
Makes sense.  In theory though, you should be getting something like 2 or 3 scepters based while you're doing the war effort?
---
Yes, if your group expects you to dps effectively. Soul link is a pure pvp talent.
---
I heard him say that on stream a bit ago.  So, unless something has changed, or that is something he's working on pre-release?
---
This is what im hoping, however according to u/hakurai the nodes are so scarce you wont be able to keep your prof level equal to your leveling speed and will have to back track eventually.
---
I think skinning and herbalism will be much easier than mining. mining might be too much detouring in low level zones to keep up
---
I'd love to see how these hanging tits worked with the game's jiggle physics.
---
Probably fucking flapping hitting you in the face whenever you move
---
I DONT WANT LINNEN CLOTH!
---
Trump if he had stitches on his skin
---
FUCK the alliance
---
Where did you get this information about phase 1 being at least two months?
---
Gnomes are the masterrace
---
The AZERTY layout offends me much more tbh

Well, make it 29477482937474819 then
---
That’s my point. It’s not that BoEs are special and the entire group is entitled to roll on them.  You’re deciding that at a certain point gold is more important to you than letting someone have an item they want to use.  That’s simply being greedy about the money, and trying to creat loot rules to justify and allow this greed (in regards to BoEs). 
---
I understand the fear of having the item ninjaed by someone who won’t actually use it and just wants the gold for themselves, but like I said in my original post, let that person be the asshole. No need to create loot rules where we all act like assholes just to avoid someone *maybe* being an asshole.
---
Dot things that will live for the full duration.
---
Sole reason I'm rolling a rogue again. Perditiona blade and core hound tooth 31-8-12. Gg wpvp
---
That’s cool. On my Everquest server there was a PUG raiding group called Ashorty(he was also the raid leader and leader of his guild) and they actually ended up being close to the best raiders in the server. When all the big guilds disbanded they were still going. 
---
It even spread out into another channel called backflag where people could get their characters flagged for harder content by doing the older content most guilds didn’t bother with.

After Rise of the Horde:
---
1. The Last Guardian by Jeff Grubb
---
2. Tides of Darkness by Aaron Rosenburg
---
3. Beyond the Dark Portal by Christie Golden and Aaron Rosenburg
---
4. Day of the Dragon by Richard A. Knaak
---
5. War of the Ancients: The Well of Eternity by Richard A. Knaak
---
6. War of the Ancients: The Demon Soul by Richard A. Knaak
---
7. War of the Ancients: The Sundering by Richard A. Knaak
---
8. Lord of the Clans by Christie Golden
---
9. Of Blood and Honor by Chris Metzen
---
10. Arthas: Rise of the Lich King by Christie Golden (has some WotLK in it, but most of it is relevant)
---
11. Illidan by William King (has some TBC in it, but most of it is relevant)
---
14. Cycle of Hatred of Keith DeCandido
---
That will give you everything relevant to Classic. Note: Though the War of the Ancients trilogy happens ~10,000 years before the rest of the novels, they're much better read *after* Day of the Dragon, which is in the correct spot but deals with time travel.
---
I HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING FOR A GUILD PROACTIVELY BEFORE RELEASE DOES IT MATTER? HOW IS YOUR GUILD ROSTER FUCKING FULL?
---
Many guilds didn't bother with Naxx because of TBC.  Basing your assumptions on that number will lead you to false conclusions.
---
Your comments on Gen Z are pretty speculative, and don't bring much to any conversation.
---
There will, without a doubt, be more guilds to full clear in classic than in vanilla.  At the very least, people will have more time.
---
Feral Druid DPS. The powershifting rotation has a lot going on.
---
I don't know why I don't know what class I want to play
---
The only thing I have stolen since was a Washington Post newspaper from a gas station about 6 months ago. I didn't realize it wasn't free till about a week later. So, don't hate on me too much, I'm just slightly stupid in the day to day parts of life.
---
Mining is work even when you have access to nodes, especially in that annoying gap between tin and iron where you're mining greens nodes for skillups.
---
Joana's pb on retail vanilla was 4d 21h. People will have routes optimized hitting 4d /played at 60, and they will easily be able to hit 60 in the first week.
---
I remember it took me about a month to hit 60 in vanilla WoW. I sure as shit wasn't a hardcore player who played 12+ hours a day and did take my time. I would say I probably averaged around 4 hours a day.
---
this guy has many friends
---
Hey Sal nice to see you
---
Genuine question, not snark: do you think retail LFG players will be able to zerg MC/Ony without any concern for old strats or giving tanks time to establish threat?
---
I only did these raids back in the early days so still have a healthy respect for how easily things could go tits-up if players were undisciplined, but I haven't seen how ppl do them on private servers these days.
---
In the real world, sure, but the time most people reserve for gaming just so happens to overlap with the time in which most would toke up: *their free time.* Big difference in social etiquette between an anonymous MMORPG and the real world, bud.
---

---
Most of the characters I've leveled recently, I've been far ahead on herbing to the point most herbs are green when I move on.
---
troll feet are BiS for foot fetish.
---
Ask for linen when you join quest groups. Tons of people just vendor it. Give them the vendor price. 
---
By the time I was 10 on pserver and again in classic stress test I had enough linen to get to 70 enchanting and make greater wands and sell them for a whopping 50silver a pop(more expensive on AH, but not as lucrative.
---
Yes, its a good starter to use shout. Both b and d. Then tab sunder :D
---
Not at all what I was saying son
---
Has always been my favorite leveling zone since retail, I remember 11 yo me was entranced with the cumulative story going on in the zone
---
You're ignoring inflation, supply and demand
---
+ You have an easy method to earn a buttload of gold
---
+ Everyone else can do the exact same thing (if they can be bothered).
---
+ They've got to spend the gold on something (which is going to be common across everyone) → Then it just becomes a contest of who has the most disposable income.
---

---
Even with the Druid if you're just using the professions for 'cooldowns' you're losing out. I mean you can't use that Druid to craft your own Flasks (needs certain PvE locations, unless my memory is wrong). How much do you intend to 'charge' for your cooldowns to begin with? In (Vanilla) I would get 10g for just zoning into UBRS (open the door, 1g per raid member) and then out of the instance. If the timing was good I'd get to open multiple doors on a single trip. How much gold would you likely make from a multi-day cloth/arcanite cooldown?
---
Maining male troll this time, their walk animation, the cheer with the strong outburst, the way they turn using keyboard, they just crack me up. They are so goofy and funny, they also get ganked less i think.

Hi, /u/IS_JOKE_COMRADE

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to be low effort.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cidbvo/ride_the_commodity_wave_and_level_engineering/). 
---
Because the other class I wanted to play got the short end of the stick for every mechanic in question during beta. No biggie though
---
It's bound, not binded. Proved you wrong.
---
I definitely used Auctioneer addon back then, but I don't recall how I used it as it has been literally a decade. I simply bought low priced items that I knew where worth more and sold them for what they were worth.  I hardly ever made huge profits, it was more about a few silver here and a few silver there that I got rich off of.  I had to work my ass off for a month or so to get my epic mount, so I wasn't making bank by any means back then. 
---
I'm sure I will use the same types of addons in Classic, but I will not go outside of what the experience was like back in the day (for example, if some gear score addon is created, I will not use it and I will shun those who do).
---
Things I flipped on AH...well it's been since WotLK since I played but as I remember it was mostly MATS.  I very rarely sold gear, especially after vanilla (as blues weren't worth much after BC launch).  Being a tailor and herbalist on my mains got me a steady flow of gold.  I mean, everyone needs flowers and textiles right?  So, yeah I did that.
---
With Classic, my suggestion is to just keep greens you get from drops that have decent stats, for a certain class (learn what different classes require).  Vendor sell the trash, but sell the good greens on AH.  If you get a blue drop, always keep that and sell it on AH.  Just compare prices and undercut if there is one one there.  Now I recall that the Auctioneer addon kept an average price sold of every item, so if you find something that isn't listed currently on AH, you can list it for the last sold price.
---
It’s been said before, but just enjoy the game. Be wary readying guides and take recommendations with a grain of salt. Play what faction, race, and class you want. Vanilla was a journey, and someone who is experiencing it for the first time should do so as they please. It will make you appreciate the game a lot more.
---
No. Imp wep totems is a terrible talent, and being so deep in enhance means it's never worth it to pickup instead of mana tide. It's so bad it's not even worth 1 shamy in a raid picking it up.
---
Fun fact, people who used typewriters were called typists!

---
Won’t the faction restriction be alive in classic wow on PvP servers?
---
Pick your class wisely.  It's a huge time investment.  If you want to DPS, just be safe and don't pick a hybrid class.
---
Because you have no short comings? you loser, go get run over by a car, in minecraft.
---
Dwarf is likely maybe hunter because the cinematic lol
---
Their entire AQ armor set is based around spell power, of course it exists.
---
They would probably be fun for the lore side of things but I’ve just always hated paladins gameplay and feel even though I’ve never played one past 20 something
---
I was totally kidding but will you be on NA servers? If you’re on American and PVP I’d love to play together
---
that's like saying you "used to be" a murderer. We can still smell retail on you.
---
depends on the player, but i think those on retail who avoid any content that can't be accessed by a group finding tool probably wouldn't find themselves in a raid, and if they did would either acclimate to the level of the guild or not raid at all
---
people breeze through the content on pservers, the difference is ridiculous with all the extra knowledge, skill and addons
---
I still got a picture in my head of when I first walked out in the wide grassy green planes with my freshly created Lvl 1 Tauren hunter.
---
Was my very first char and I dumped him at lvl 15 but man that was a good feeling.
---
Same reason I picked Warrior in 2005. I like to hit things with a big sword/stick/mace.
---
JUMP ON A PRIVATE SERVER AND TRY IT OUT. THEY’RE INSANELY POPULATED RIGHT NOW. GO TO A BLIZZLIKE SERVER TO TEST OUT A  PVP LEVELING SPEC, OR AN INSTANT 60 SERVER TO TRY OUT PVP.  NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS ITS PTW, BUT ITS DECENT PRACTICE.
---
Sit for a lot a bit
---
fond memory... farming RFD for coldrage daggers to kill Viscidus AQ40
---
This, but seeing as most levelling warlocks won't even have Bane, yeah... you can see warlocks don't have a lot of fun in 5mans while levelling. They're ok, but not a great dps compared to the warriors/mages.
---
Don't worry. His guides aren't the greatest and there are better alternatives out there. You might be better off missing out on whatever addon he won't get ready for release.
---
WF's 20% chance to give you free swings is the part that matters. 
---
The bonus AP is ok, but dropping  22 tallents points to buff the AP a bit is like wow, that's a genuinely impresively bad idea :P
---
The lock/mage/priests would be upset because someone playing a subpar unconventional spec is taking loot over them basically for the memes. It's a waste of time and efficiency, and it's the exact same situation as the "hunter loot" joke about hunters taking weapons from warriors and rogues. This meme spec is essentially wasting the gear. And before I get down voted, I'm not saying not to play it, but simply for this guy to understand why people aren't going to like this and why he will have trouble finding groups.
---
I agree, fuck the bots.  I was there 100% of the time i was gaming it.  The only thing I had was the add on that told me what the last price and avg price sold was.
---
Bro he means female horde has human proportions while male don't
---
I think your still not reading his posts properly.
---
He said it worked on beta and then they „fixed“ it so it won’t work. Which implies their aware of it and decided to do it anyway.
---
That’s all under the assumption he’s telling the truth which I can’t proof.
---
Something I never had the skill or patience to do in wow was play the ah. I’ve always liked the idea but I like half assed it twice and ended up losing money or breaking even when I would try to buy people out. 
---
Idk if I’m cut out for it. Not good with money irl either so idk why I tried in the first place
---
You did a lot better then most of us. A bunch of us unsubscribed after 30 mins - 1 hour in BFA. I will tack on to what you said about mechagon (I haven’t played it). Blizzard is putting out some of the most amazing single player content ever. I was shocked even reading the synopsis for mechagon. But I’d play legend of Zelda if I wanted solo content. I’m here for an mmorpg.
---
Agree to my ass...  you mean u will just say it then ninja the first few items
---
I am pretty sure I am the opposite!
---
DYING IN NORTHERN BARRENS MAKES ME WANT TO BLOW MY BRAINS OUT
---
+1 pfquest&gt;questie by a longshot. Shows you each node spawn individually it’s dope af
---
Why would 3-point 15% damage increase on an ability, that is likely to be 1/4th of your damage at best, be "mandatory" for PvP?
---
Why would 2H Axe/Mace be "mandatory" for PvP if you're running 1H/shield or staves with equal stats?
---
You too!  Still don't know what I'm gonna roll.  Been a mage in vanilla, a priest in BC, and a shaman in WotLK.  May just roll a priest again because I like torture.
---
Go for it!!! Like a few other people said, if you're willing to make mistakes and learn as you go, you can play pretty much any class or spec you like. It's a learning process, but if you feel drawn to it, there's no reason you shouldn't pursue it.
---
Good luck and...Lok'tar OGAR!
---
Some will still take 2 or 3 weeks tho. The people who are speed leveling with a job will probably take 2-3 weeks and the people who havent practiced or arent as adept at it will prob take a little longer.
---
Didn't they break that back in MoP?
---
Lok'tar Ogar! Welcome to the horde.
---
Insight. Sorry to be that guy :)
---
Also I can’t answer your question - but remember the weird event where you could get an item and a weird shadow/ghost would follow you around?
---
I’m still horde deep down
---
I think it heavily depends on the server. Asmongold's server will most definitely crash as everyone will be in one spot whereas on a normal server, there will actually be people in all of the starting areas and some people will get out of the starting zones pretty early.
---
Oh, yeah demo shout too. I meant the shouts in general.
---
Thunder clap slows enemy attack speed so that's not a great idea. Also requires battle stance so no threat mod from def stance.
---
Nice particle density
---
The good news is I know you aren't spying on me.  Because if you were, you'd know I have.
---
Most of the races are similar in horde and human.
---
So bro if Male Orc doesn’t have human proportions but female Orc does that means Quasimodo doesn’t.
---
You're talking about ranged spell power hunter, using the T2.5 that reduces Arcane Shot's CD and boosts your spellpower. I'm not talking about that though, it would make *too much sense.* 
---
I'm talking about *melee* spell power hunter that focuses on running Deathbringer+shadow oil and using the spellpower to boost the damage of those procs. Then again, the same person that was saying this was a good idea was saying boomkins would outdps every mage but the one that has the rolling ignite.
---
Check out countdown to classic episode 38 and 41. Like 3 hours dedicated to wow economy and playing the auction house on classic
---
I think you're downplaying the amount of people with lives that will only play like 20 hrs a week. There will be a lot more on official classic servers than private servers I'd imagine
---
Also, one thing.  When you were selling on the AH in vanilla, people would find you standing at the AH and ask you to take stuff off the listing pay you right then and there for ending the auction.  The community back then was great, I hope it comes back.
---
still try to que for it but the wait time is huge. 
---
2 favorite builds were:
---
warlock ult with venge aura, lycan feral impulse when it was dmg/AS and some other steroid like aura or empower, i was ahead on lvls and with ags refresher and minion buffing aura items my golems killed the enemy team.
---
second build was meepo ult with tinker rocket, maiden nova
---
honorable mention for rearm with clock rocket and tinker rockets or regrowth
---
Man wow has so much untapped potential for fun.
---
Forget about the best city in the game? Also ally lower levels is drastically better and alliance has better BRD access
---
Thanks. I am one of the few who aren’t interested in the Barrens (thought that was the first zone I ever saw the game). I love 1K needles and I’ve never gone back to those roots before.
---
And honestly I’m not looking for pvp more a relaxing leveling experience that I probably won’t actually put that much time into
---
Please disregard the people saying it is useless to spec improved windfury as Resto. While there is some debate on whether improved windfury spec or mana tide spec (and rotating each Shaman to use tide in the healer or Mage group) is ideal, ultimately it's going to be up to your guild and what works best for you. Most high end Horde guilds agree that having at least one Shaman this spec in the tank group for max tps is best. 
---
There is quite a bit of variation to the spec. Some guilds have the Shaman also using Annihilator or Nightfall during periods of low raid damage, which makes talents like Flurry and Nature's Guidance decent to help with uptime. Then there is also whether or not you are primarily a tank healer (and pick up Imp Healing Wave + Healing Way) or if you are primarily a raid healer and instead focus on Chain Heal and reduced mana costs. 
---
Totemic Focus is underwhelming unless you are totem twisting WF with Agi/Tranquil in which case it becomes vital. From my experience totem twisting is not typically done much until BWL levels of gear due to the mana consumption but we still have yet to see how much raid damage there is in classic raids compared to private servers. Less damage might mean opportunity to incooperate twisting sooner. 
---
This was the spec I used during MC: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxi0dVMZEcbz0ea
---
I was a MT healer, didn't use Annihilator/Nightfall and wasn't twisting until BWL (at which time I filled out Totemic Focus). Some Shaman also like to go Healing Focus over Tidal Mastery but I never experienced a lot of pushback in MC and the extra 5% crit is nice for tank healing to proc more ancestral fortitude.
---
The thing to remember is Fire Resist totem is a water totem. Most fights (and trash) in MC + BWL + Ony, you are going to be better off dropping Fire Resist for the 4 melee in your group than dropping Mana Spring for just yourself (which takes 20 seconds to recoup it's own mana cost).
---
How is horde objectively better
---
Lol dude they don't need every single piece. Once they get all purples and bis blues they will get bored of speedrunning mc while carrying a moonkin or something.
---
I thought the same at first, but buffs from other party members will give you a lot of crit.
---
In game you will find that 90% of the time it's the person who just happens to be getting carried in shitty gear, maybe it's their third alt, or maybe they just spend all their time RPing in goldshire... but either way, they are very sure that all the people who invested time and effort in to their characters are morally obligated to hand  things off to their them on account of how they are too new, slow, or incompetent to have gotten it for themselves.  
---
This is Particularly true for the super rare epic barons mount, and shockingly even later the ones in ZG.
---
It never failed that some asshat tried to claim precedence by virtue of their own incompetence if they dropped in a pug.
---
AZERTYWTF?
---
Sorry, I hoped the joke was obvious
---
Holy shit I remember these! We sold them at the GameStop I worked at in high school. They were fucking expensive. Never had one though. Thanks for the mammaries!
---
I love how he asks you all these particular questions then just doesn't even recommend anything lmfaoo Reddit will never not amuse me
---
Imo you should check out rogue! I'm surprised no one else has said it! Druid and Hunter as well, even warlock too (pet classes have that much more to manage) but rogue is crazy how much you're always button mashing especially with strafe bound in there somewhere lol and I recommend this with a heavy heart as someone who only hates hunters more than rogues hehe
---
Let people know you are not familiar with the dungeon and its fine.
---
It always said end of 2019 (or earlier) in the launcher.
---
Why would you think that they would release it earlier, makes no sense to throw it out just like that between or before important other releases. We had some retail patches, the classic beta hype, classic next month and then maybe another retail patch. Nov and Dec makes sense when the hype from classic settled and there is no wow retail content. Then there is room for the reforge hype
---
Remember, Paladins are wearing cloth and almost only used for healing in PvE endgame.
---
Priests also almost exclusively have to heal endgame pve, shadow is good for in endgame pvp 
---
Druids also almost exclusively have to heal endgame pve, there is theorycrafting that feral ain't useless but people will be skeptical. 
---
Shamans also almost exclusively have to heal endgame.
---
BUT, guilds want warm bodies, if you do what you should and listen you'll find a spot almost with any spec. 
---
Most of all, have fun leveling. It's amazing
---
/r/medizzy
---
Ah, a man of class I see. Pointing out a foreign persons small mistake in a comment. I wonder what your english grades are?
---
It is obviously against the tos, but blizzard doesn't care cuz money.
---
Asmongold threw a cross faction pvp tournament, pretty safe to say collusion isn’t TOS anymore.
---
Grinding on the way to and from quests is a worthy use of time.  And sometimes the time to travel to a quest isn't worth it.
---
felt the same way reading this thread
---
This is the classic wow reddit, not bfa
---
I remember having a note pad and writing down mat prices every few hours of the day, every day. After a few weeks, I could gauge the average price of an item and buy when cheap and resell when in high demand. Loved playing the AH!
---
Basically never happened back then. This is more common on the shit pirated servers, because 90% of those people are fucking trash.
---
Ignore the math that proves its worthless...  what great advice Mr warrior.
---
He has has his guide on the website for years. 
---
Joana isn't making the addon. He has a company converting his guide into an ingame addon version. 
---
What joana is doing is trying to make his guide better in two ways, first way is quicker and more efficient, second way is more defined for each class and he has several people helping him with that also, like mage specific tips or quests for a certain staff or trinket, stuff like that.
---
Nah hella people did this back on live I never played private. Once the game was out for awhile and people were paying high amounts for BOE’s a lot of groups started to do this. The money was high enough that even when the class who could use it got it they would go put it on the ah. Gold is hard to come by and getting your first mount can be difficult. Hitting it big with that random drop can help everyone out a lot. As long as the group agrees beforehand I think it’s fine. Obviously just taking it without saying anything would be frowned upon.
---
oh i intend to suck hardcore in  5mans while leveling
---
I still have one but with WotLK keyboard/overlay
---
It's horrible, I don't plan to play with it ever again
---
Man running UBRS (over and over again), BRD, and then doing the MC attunement and Ony attunement with friends was my best memories.  That and getting my priest staff, Benediction with help from just random awesome people on my server.  Wish I could remember my first server name, I transferred to Ysera later in vanilla before BC.
---
i mean. Arcane Brilliance is ~1%, what else?
---
i'm not defending it as a real raid spec, just saying you can mess around for a little while.
---
Definitely in the same boat.
---
I was lucky enough to get in the beta, I played that RELIGIOUSLY to say the least. Tbh, I just had negative desire to play retail once the beta came to an end, but one of my subs from my stream donated some money for me to try it.
---
So on a whim, I went for it.
---
Gave it a shot, started playing in both new zones. The questing was pretty cool. It thought the aesthetics were pretty nice too.  
---
Since OG Classic, I’ve always been an avid WPvP’er (I main Druid) so I was excited when I started seeing alliance doing quests too. This shadow priest opened up on me as I was questing so I took the challenge. I got him down to 10% health 3 separate times, and he still he healed to almost full.... each time.
---
I was baffled but I got my CD’s back up, and went all in. Got him SUPER low (again), and then out of nowhere he just started bouncing away INSANE distances. With my travel form + wild charge leaps I still couldn’t keep up with him. He just kept bouncing and bouncing until he eventually got away.
---
With my frustration, I asked general chat how he was able to do that... someone said it’s an item from one of the world bosses I think? Anyway, I think it goes without saying. 8.2/ BFA seems so silly for pvp anymore. I even watch the arena matches and nothing happens until 50% dampening 8 minutes into the match.
---
I dunno boys... I just don’t see what people enjoy about it anymore. Everything is autopilot it seems like these days.
---
kb yes
---
I thought you were asking where I was gonna bind the Rogue spell Preparation. Trying to figure out how to rebind my mouses sensitivity buttons to give me too more. I like to put Kick, Gouge, Vanish, Stealth, Sprint to the mouse already. Having Prep on there would be nice but not required since it's a 10 minute cooldown.
---
H A R D   B O I
---
It objecively smells worse, that's for sure.  And I say this as a hordesman.
---
LOL I GOT DOWNVOTED IN A CAPS LOCK RANT THREAD!!
---
He's also not even a good player. I cant watch his streams because it's kind of cringe. He has stupid deaths,  controls his character weird, etc. 
---
But he does hold the fastest time and is the first person to put out a leveling guide so you have to credit and respect him for those achievements. 
---
I have used his guide and will pair that with questie in classic. As far as I know he was the only one doing a 1-60 leveling route addon. The other guides are just online and tell what paths to take.
---
&gt; says he doesn’t understand why people put smoking/drinking references in their name 
---
&gt; other poster gives insight as to why people would do such thing 
---
&gt; “not at all what I was saying son”
---
Hell no, Human Warlocks are PVP beasts! With Perception + Paranoia Rogues will have a really difficult time opening on you from stealth.
---
Shortswords were typically used for piercing.
---
On what server? Private servers have massively increased node spawns.
---
Grim Dawn is a better game  (especially with expansions) and goes more alomg the diablo 2 Route.  5€ on steamsale
---
Most bosses aren't attacking with fire.
---
You can also just stand in the corner near that arch under a lower ledge so that you basically don’t hardly get off the ground.  Helps more for casters.
---
I understand where you're coming from. I almost thought about doing the same and making an enh shaman but I just love the alliance leveling zones so much.
---
&gt;And there's the speedrunning community. That community is known to play a game nearly forever because there's always something to improve. Classic means every speedrunner guild is on the same rules, no more different private server shenanigans, so I expect the community being way more serious than on private servers.
---
Sorta, but it also very recently worked for the french and germans. Remember how much people were dreading the unofficial polish or spanish servers? They somehow all disappeared just as soon as the FR/DE realms were approved.
---
So I rolled a hunter back in the day initially because my guild needed one and my roommate really talked them up. Get to shoot guns (I exclusively used these even if a better bow dropped. I just loved the SFX. And I was a troll too), Get to wear the second heaviest armor class and you won't even need it since you get the meatshield pet of your choice and all the kiting. Get to track humanoid and manhunt other people down. I was such a bad hunter that my roommate actually shelved his main and rolled one instead. 
---
Then I learned the magic of rogues and played one for a long time. It cannot be overstated how fun stealth is. I'm maining a shaman this time, but I will still have a rogue alt to funnel drops towards and play when I'm feeling opportunistic.
---
This is the place for official classic. I’m sure you could google the name of an un official realm and they would have info on getting started.
---
That sounds like a terrible group layout
---
Necroing this because I keep seeing this sentiment. Why’s the gold/he for mage over rogue once DM farming is in? Because the time invested(120 hours to be generous) to get to 60 needs to outweigh just farming as a rogue. Are you saying a level 60 mage our farms a 60 rogue so much that 120+ hours of leveling a mage ca 120 of rogue gold farming is worth it? The first 3-5 hours alone account for ~100+ gold you could make on your rogue instead of level a mage in my calculation.
---
Locks tend to be super popular regardless just because SS/summon are god tier time savers in vanilla dungeons anyway.
---
If you can do all that while maintaining a polite and friendly attitude towards people who somehow screw up pressing that button once every four seconds, you'll be considered a decent tank. It's like you're playing a completely different game.   
---
Classic is the first time I won't be rolling a warrior on a new server. One of the reasons for that is because I don't want to spit bile at bads, everyone's gotta start somewhere, but 90 minutes into a run where I've been pushing 150+ apm on every pull because the dps can't get it together, I just don't have the zen.
---
/u/DanTopTier no to both
---
That's absurd Holydiver is a much better name for a Paladin
---
Hunter - My first character in vanilla, I never raided but I always wanted full dragonstalker, so thats what Im gonna do this time around, I dont care much about anything, just want to look bad ass!
---
...so?

tbf I don't think many of them will be expecting to feral right off the bat in raids. otherwise they'll be disappointed
---
I think because the whole idea "can i solo end game final boss" is stupid. Not even hunters can do it
---
I loved sneaking into capitals, ganking the hell out of some dude at a vendor, then watching safely from a balcony somewhere as four hunters zoomed in and started flaring up the joint.
---
Hunter weapon
---
Whack-a-mole
---
Thank you everyone that responded, big help
---
You make a good point! Cheers to that.
---
I believe the idea that HoJ works is based on old posts that pointed out the difference in language. HoJ is "Equip: something something" while a weapon like TUF (which doesn't work for kitties) says "Chance on Hit: something".
---
probably not since everyone can play too.
---
unless you are going for some world records or are hilarious as fuck
---
Like the great Arnold Schwarzenegger once said, “I’ll be back.”
---
You ONLY have 12 buttons? Noob!
---
No, they solo the final boss. Which is also all the bosses you would kill in a normal tribute run.
---
I'm decided on warrior. I love tanking I'm pretty good at it and always needed. Orc or Tauren not sure yet but really love Warstomp and extra reach. But it's look so damn cool in plate and stun resist..
---
Numbers will be big on launch because of a bunch of big streamers playing it.
---
I'd expect it to die off after a few weeks.
---
Streaming WoW is basically a glorified Just Chatting stream. It's pretty boring to watch since most of the end game is grinding.
---
U will be banned
---
Quick I need a mage to remove curse from me
---
Here’s to that!
---
I know this is highly subjective, but I love the class fantasy aspect of warlocks. Warlocks have a lot of flavor and it is clear that the designers and artists put a lot of love into them.
---
And? It was quite obvious from the announcement and footage shown it was still early in development.
---
I just resubbed like a month ago and i'm basically play a singleplayer game. I don't want to raid and there is absolutely no player interaction forced upon me, so i haven't spoken to a single person since i reactivated and i just play it ultra-casual to farm tmogs and mounts and shit, can't force myself to do more.
---
BFA has been a horrible experience for me so far, idk man
---
I'd imagine a 3day 60 on launch is impossible on Classic, 4 days will be doable but up until ~12-18 months ago all the major private servers (Nost included) were using 2.3 XP tables, which put Quest XP 30-60 40% higher than the values we'll have in Classic and i've not seen a sub 4day run since the major servers fixed that.
---
We're talking cutting nearly 21 hours off the current record to hit 3 days 23 hours and on launch some of the quest content that fills gaps is potentially missing because it contains catch up gear / stories related to later raids. Though they confirmed Thorium Point due to it's relation to MC.
---
I live two days ahead of what you consider to be your current time.
---
Its not very big compared to retail.
---
30*4=120 hours. That's 5 days - you would've been just short of the world record at the time - not bad!
---
&gt; simple economics
---
Yea, you messing with supply (you know, the other side of demand) isnt fucked up.
---
I had the same experience. People would (rightfully) call you a ninja if you needed on a BOE that was a upgrade or BIS for another guy if you couldn't use it.
---
Kotor crystal cave :)
---
The shit healer that doesn't need an add-on to heal yup
---
Spell penetration needs listed under spell stats
---
most flavorful class for horde + windfury weapon
---
I actually got the tbc one sitting at my parents, should go find it before launch
---
TRAITOR!!!! I SHALL FIND YOU AND WITH THE GREAT HOLY LIGHT I SHALL SHOW YOU THE ERROR OF YOUR WAYS. REPENT FILTHY HORDE SCUM!!! AS A PALADIN I AM CHARGED WITH CLEANSING THE ONCE PURE LANDS OF THESE HEATHEN HORDE AND SHALL BE KILL ALL I FIND... (with the help of a big strong warrior to do all the damage.)
---
Feel free to provide "the math"
---
I am definitely going horde. Always been horde, always will be horde.
---
Why are you so obsessed with people who want to level up fast? I'm fairly sure we've argued about it in the past and today doing some casual browsing I've seen your name pop up several times on the matter, once again.
---
Is this Sul‘Thraze on your back? Nice!
---
I find that they generally excel in different areas, which is why it's hard to choose. Besides PvE DPS that is, mage is winning that all the way until AQ40/Naxx. Mage also has better AoE DPS for sure.
---
Because is Horde Scum and deserves to be removed.
---
When I first entered Ironforge on my level 10 Gnome and saw a Level 60 Dwarf Warrior doing Blacksmithing on that huge anvil. It was one of the most badass things ever to see as a noob.
---
Yeah, I've always felt that the class flavor and fantasy regarding warlocks was incredibly strong.
---
You can buy Blizzard Gift cards from Gamestop or another retailer, (can be used for game time)
---
Didn't they say there will be no seperate realms for different languages? Or did I miss something?
---
Seeing that 9 fps even out in the world questing hurt my soul. How the fuck did you guys play that shit, holy. I mean my PC wasnt better but I had 30 atleast haha.
---
Oh god.....
---
I got into leet speak, and trying to write fast so I’d abbreviate everything. Come around to writing “come” as “cum” and wondering why it was changed by the profanity filter. Asked everyone. No one would tell me.
---
Female trolls have the goofiest looking run in vanilla, I think. I don't think I could stand to look at it.  Male trolls have much better animations in general. The 2H ones are pretty nice.
---
The absolutely bonkers base duration of sap would make it more viable in vanilla I'd say. If you get someone with no CDs ready, they're just going to stand around for, I think, like 40 seconds.
---
Yeah there’s a pretty big scene for it when it’s poppin! Great idea, glad to have ya back and good luck!! What faction?
---
YOU MUST BE FUN AT PARTIES. JUST KIDDING, NO ONE LIKES YOU GO AWAY
---
I got a warrior to 15 solo in 13 hours. Played with a friend priest and am at 14 on a warrior at 7 hours. Keep in mind the solo warrior was my first time in 14 years and the second had the extra practice but still... quite the difference and a whole lot funner.
---
Shaman are notoriously rough on mana when undergeared so it may be best to start as Mana Tide and then switch to imp. WF when you reach a point where you feel you no longer need it.
---
no, cause its release and literally everyone waits to play. when was the last time someone invented a new sport ten of thousands waited to play at the same time all around the world?
---
not saying you cant stream, just stating that you better have a good reason why people should watch you instead of trying it for themselves right at launch.
---
a few weeks in, sure. at release? expect to be alone in your stream
---
If we are getting a Classic release is, in part, because the game has been alive for years in private servers. I know that there are different kinds of servers with different content pacing, but I'm fairly sure Blizzard has that under control. I don't think the worry should be the initial content, but rather, the post-Naxx content. As I heard, private servers just die after Naxxramas is on farm and a fresh server is opened.
---
&gt;The lack of content at release is the reason why 3/4 of players will quit.
---
The vast majority of players won't make it to 60. That's how it's always been. 
---
Have you played in a private server yourself?
---
I had the battlefield 2 layout...
---
Calm down Kurapika
---
Ive played alot on pservers during the years wow has been shit ( End of Wrath, and forward). So ive grown accustomed to same the binds.  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/CHAELRi](https://imgur.com/a/CHAELRi)
---
Yeah I find it hard to believe.
---
So mechagon is cool? I kinda miss wow. Have not played it for hmm 6 months or more. 
---
I need to read up on that. 
---
I am however a bit reluctwe to play retail now. I don’t want to get burned out before classic.
---
Except Starcraft: Remastered was all 2-d sprites and had way, way less assets than WC3. Not to mention they didnt touch any of the cutscenes or map design in Remastered.
---
Bitch ass alliance thot
---
This had probably been my longest lasting keyboard ever. My brother gifted me one before I even started playing WoW in 2006, and I used it until 2014 or so.
---
Getting ambushed by a rogue several levels above me while leveling my priest in STV and still managed to kill him using gnomish battle chicken and shit. Never had a pulse rate that high before and after that in my life...
---
Sit down, shut up and don't spill ice-cream on the seat.
---
Druid is far from being a noob friendly class. There is a really high skill cap you have to pass if you want to do anything in pvp.
---
Will I be able to gain soul shards in battlegrounds? I know I can on private servers but how about classic?
---
Well, it of course matters only, if you want to make some traffic on your channel or you will be streaming from the pure love of the game, despite the number of viewers
---
sure
---
Still one of my top 3 spots.    
---
I would make a fire and craft up some chow or whatever, great spot to chill.
---
tauren shaman named Moochainz
---
Cool picture. That got me kinda wanted to play a night elf arms warrior again. 
---
But why are they soo tall? And I hate to ride a cat:(
---
Well my chosen classes are Warlock and Warrior. :)
---
I like the fantasy of fighting evil with evil that Warlock has, as well as using one's own health for power. It's an independent class that is nonetheless able to help others.
---
With tank, I'm not necessarily a leader type, it's more about stepping into a role others may not want to do. I also like the aspect of it being a difficult class to level that pays off later.
---
Reading comps low with you. I played all of cata and most of panda. Warlords made me quit and legion/bfa is just utter trash. I’m well aware as are most players by evidence of the subscriber numbers.
---
Hihi
---
He definitely is, though. He has *one* mechanic in Burning Adrenaline. A DPS check is still a tank and spank. Same way Patchwerk is. 
---
I disagree *heavily* with Vael being a challenging fight if your DPS players are decent. Keep in mind that people have learned a lot since the vanilla days, and that technology has improved vastly. It’s not uncommon these days to output more DPS in prebis than people would do in their MC/BWL gear. ‘Purple fever’ isn’t as prevalent anymore, so you likely won’t see magi, warlocks, shaman, paladins etc in their terrible tier 1 gear compared to much more well-statted blues.
---
Gnomer is easier to access for horde than alliance. We get a teleporter in BB that sends us straight into the dungeon. SM is a pain for alliance as well.
---
Yes, thank god. Wouldn't want to let people decide for themselves on something that doesn't impact you one iota!
---
I edited that like 30 seconds after. Whatever.
---
Sure i agree the game is way worse than it was. Obviously. But im saying you personally, don't know what you are talking about. Since you dont know the game anymore.
---
Aside from the other great answers here, I REALLY recommend playing Warcraft 3.
---
It takes place a few years before the start of WoW and sets up most of the characters and factions in the game.
---
Not to mention that it's a great game with a very good story in it's own right.
---
I along with most of my friends from wow tried to replay and just couldn’t. We want the world of Warcraft not some solo bootleg the Witcher 3.
---
You can add click modifiers i.e. alt, shift, ctrl, etc. If you heal using the raid frames or any kind of list it makes it a little easier to just wack-a-mole heals, dispells and such.
---
Tanking is a skill almost anyone can learn to be at least decent at with enough practice. And there are plenty of guides out there to set you on the right path.
---
I am ambivalent to this view.  Pservers got a lot of pretty basic shit wrong, so I don't trust Pserver data.  
---
However on the other hand someone posted a question here last night asking something to the effect of 
---
&gt;what pulls do you remember from classic dungeons that were really hard, and what were your strategies for handling them?
---
They offered the fire elemental pulls on the bridge from the golem lord to the grim guzzler as their example, and said freeze trap and banish were really helpful here. 
---
And I do remember those pulls, and remember them being extremely hard if you didn't have a hunter/warlock. 
---
and then in the next 8 seconds I thought of a dozen ways I could have handled them better based on a more advanced understanding of mechanics and more flexible goal-oriented thinking.
---
You can tank a whole lottle if the thing you’re tanking is a horde rogue or warrior.
---
CAT DURID IS 4 FITE!
---
Keep yer feet on th’ ground!
---
Skinning is about 20g of vendor trash by level 40.
---
Thats fair enough. But that doesnt mean you know what the game can be now if you actually try. Since you didnt.
---
I did the whole Blizzard thing back in the day. I'd finally get in after waiting half the day, see the alliance at at the horde base, and I'd just rally all the Mages and Warlocks to spam their rain spells. Slowly push the alliance back. Within an hour or so, we get to the bottleneck of the bridge.
---
If you both are warlocks, it won’t be fun when loot drops and you both will be /roll on everything. Better off Rolling a warrior to start and while your are playing with your friend.  Then you can pay a warlock when ur friend isn’t online.
---
You new to life or something? What people say they're going to do and what people actually do are 2 very different things. 
---
Maybe you will just blindly believe everything that people say. I don't. I follow their actions. And their actions say Mage will be much more popular Warlock.
---
That cave always gave me a feeling of christmas.
---
Don’t forget... a walrus
---
I know what the game can be. Amazing solo content. Piss poor PvP. A hallow as fuck world. And then challenging raid content if I find a like minded people. 
---
Sounds lame as fuck. I’ll play legend of Zelda.
---
Thank you. But honestly, having trying it (still on the linen farm part...) on a pservers :
---
1/ Okay, without wand I am oom all the time. + the dps may really make a difference
---
2/ But that is a hell to farm... Humanoïds are often packed. I plan on dwarf priest : the first humanoid looting linen are trolls. They are STUPIDLY sitting around their fire in some mountains... Some packs are 3-4 (even not a bad pull).
---
Now I am thinking : it is really a long journey to level in Vanilla. Not use to that anymore (and it is a good thing). So I would better do this wand this, cause it save a lot of time. I hope I am doing a mistake.
---
But If I do that, no reason to not do the Lvl 13 one. I have to check how much ressources it costs.
---
Maybe prepare a group with a friend to farm them. Another priest or mage/warlock who sees the point will have this wand for no "click price".
---
They also don't have 200 other people levelling in the same zone as you'd have with a fresh server.
---
Ah I knew it!! I remembered that the greed/need roll wasnt always there. I remember that everyone wrote in the group chat ”Need” or ”greed” and based on that everyone rolled or passed.
---
This makes no sense. You can vendor BoPs too, which makes money that everyone needs equally.
---
always and forever &lt;3
---
This is correct.
---
I played Classic beta on a macbook 2015, and I sustained 60 fps at low settings. At times, there were 50-100 players on the screen and FPS dropped to 40ish
---
Exactly
---
This is stupid. One can vendor BoPs too to make money.
---
So many things I've forgotten about until I see a picture. I can't wait until I'm actually exploring and experiencing again.
---
Can't tell what they are playing, work speakers fail
---
Yes. Shadowburn as a finisher always returns a soul shard in honorable PvP.
---
How come? Care to explain?
---
Bops can be sold to vendor too as ”cash drops”
---
That's HILLARIOUS LOL
---
So I spent way too long figuring out why that couple was showing their town they were ready for classic before I turned up my speakers and understood wtf was happening in this thread.
---
Great points
---
I'm not sure it counts, but I used to heal farming raids as Ret because no one noticed and I didn't feel like respeccing lol
---
I had one of these, actually used it too lol 
---
Ahhh good times
---
Eh?
---
CoA main target first, then usually Corr same target
---
CoA second target, then Corr second target 
---
Then, usually, wand. Once you get Nightfall you can Shadowbolt when NF procs. Also if you've **just** gotten a new rank of SB then it's probably slightly better DPS than your wand, so you can Shadowbolt instead of wanding. 
---
If you're blessed with a Druid tank you can DoT up all the mobs since they're swiping which should keep aggro off you. 
---
In general: you want CoA to tic as much as possible (because the damage ramps). Having read dozens of guides + classic experience -- even though I know CoA does more damage I still always started with Corruption (once I had Nightfall) because getting a NF proc meant padding my own numbers on the damage meters. 
---
tl;dr CoA+Corruption 1-2 main targets -&gt; Wand/Shadowbolt. Ez Pz
---
Why? On the same logic you can just need on all BoPs and vendor them for gold.
---
Wait what? What potion is that?
---
Please don't follow this person's advice for 2GCDs you get in a bunch of damage. 
---
Those two dots will do more damage than the extra 1 shadowbolt (assuming 2s cast time) over the course of the mob's life.
---
The D20 archetypes follow more like this
---
Fighter (Warrior)
---
Wizard, Sorcerer (Mage)
---
Necromancer, Conjurer, Dark Wizard, Evil Cleric (Warlock, SPriest)
---
Holy Healer (Priest, Paladin)
---
Holy Damage (Paladin 😂)
---
Nature Healer (Druid, Shaman)
---
Nature Damage (Druid, Shaman)
---
Rogue (Rogue)
---
Bard (nothing but shamans and paladins fill this role in a practical sense)
---
Ranger (Hunter)
---
Still got mine aswell but won't use it because it's horrible. Yours is in good condition mine is not.
---
Shaman was the first class I got to 60 and loved enhancement.  Being able to do a good amount of damage and having heals to keep me in fights was awesome.  Then of course..........windfury.  And back when windfury proc'd windfury.  Good times.....good times.
---
wow it's brand new too, im jealous
---
With the WOTLK login theme.
---
Stuff like TSM will probably be in classic since classic is based on the modern client. If you don’t want to use those addons you’ll have a hard time since they’re so powerful an all your competition will use them.
---
Tee hee
---
&gt;Could farm my full pre-BiS and enough gold to influence the economy.
---
Wait, you will do this anyway, even without DM.
---
If you are months ahead of the Majority then yes you absolutely be able to farm things like Devilsaur Leather and other rare mats before anyone else does, put those things on farm, even keep other people from being able to farm them,   and thus have major extensive control over the economy.
---
Adding DM to this fact makes zero additional impact.   The fact that you try to argue with this mentality shows you already are the kind of person who is going to do this anyways,  so why would anyone want to take your advice?
---
Fuckin dumb. I live on a planet full of fucking morons.
---
Good luck, with layering - you are going to be fighting 10x the undercutters.
---
I think that hits the nail on its head. People know it's bullshit, but they try to justify it, because the reward is too great not to be tempting.
---
This is so f***ing beautiful
---
surprisingly accurate
---
My first time walking into brill I ran into a level 36 rogue with the defias mask and both his weapons enchanted. I thought he was so cool.
---
Underrated reply
---
I had one of these too. It was quite good in certain games lol
---
You’re in for a disappointment. Classic is the only version of wow where Alliance has a significant advantage in both pve and pvp.
---
In da club
---
It just covers the basics, without having to script anything. Such as resolution setup, logins etc. Its basicly for the new lazy multiboxer ;)
---
I go druid, because it's legit the healing class that fits my playstyle in pvp and overall. I think priest is better in anyway, but I would have no fun in pvp. I'm not going to sacrifice my own enjoyment in classic for a more powerful class or because it's going to be "easier" to get into dungeons.
---
Screw that. People need to chill.
---
"people have it down to 3-4 days gameplay" yeah - all sub-100 of them...
---
I'd agree with that, Bloodvine set is incredibly impactful for warlocks especially.
---
I was more chiming on the point that late AQ40/Naxx, warlocks started scaling incredibly hard.
---
This is really freaking amazing, If you are open for some suggestions here are mine (nonetheless this is really amazing and the whole community should be thankful):
---
1- adding sorting for the items displayed after or before apply filters in the items window. so if i press on  **ITEM, REQ., ARMOR, TYPE or SOURCE** it sorts them by ascending and/or descending based on the column i am selecting.
---
2- in character page, if i click on an item slot, while the same sorting options that are available in the dedicated item page would be awesome but the sorting is much more needed there with columns like REQ. being a necessity.
---
3- Adding an "unequip all" button, to do the exact opposite of the "auto-fill" button.
---
4- Adding the talent tree to manually assign the talent points.
---
5- Adding a theory-crafting menu for the character and gear created and if that requires too much work, a simple list of spells available to that character with the theoretical damage/healing output of such spell with cast time and mana cost (displaying the highest rank of each spell but allowing to click on the spell to open a window of all the lower ranks and their current effect).
---
6- Adding the character model (also not of top importance)
---
A side note, what is the EP? it felt like it was the scaling numbers of something but i am not certain, could you explain it (maybe add a tooltip on the website too).
---
Please know that what you done is already more than enough and it is amazing. the above are just notes and ideas in case you feel like you want to further develop the tool.
---
Hahaha, this is my favourite response so far 😂.
---
Thrash blade for sure
---
A quick question mate - did you guys run quests or just farmed? :)
---
Just realized once I got home it’s the TBC login, each login screen has their own theme at the start then it cycles in order of previous Expacs through the older themes, at least that’s what YouTube videos of the logins screens suggest.
---
Your English is very good, just remember to use punctuation and paragraphs.
---
BoPs have low gold value vs BoE. But feel free to need on them, just don't expect the community to accept you after a while.
---
Same for you man. Dont expect the community to accept you after you need on the BoEs that someone actually needs for use.
---
They're not expecting casuals to quit, they're expecting mostly people who are just coming over from bfa to level to 20 and check the game out to quit. The balance of hardcore/casual in the overall population will still be there.
---
Who the fuck moves using the arrow keys?
---
Mage
---
* lazy as fuck, could teleport everywhere and make my own food
---
* kite warriors to death with rank 1 frostbolt
---
* teleport to places you shouldn't be in (you could blink through invisible wall in searing gorge and travel to the zone underneath stormwind. If you jump into the big square hole in the ground, you would end up in mage quarters of SW) Practically stuff like this but only in the live version [WoW - Exploration the Movie](https://youtu.be/UWMz7-7SGlo)
---
* spell dmg gear is distributed through your gear so its less stressful compared to e.g. warriors who's wep is big chunk of the dmg
---
Ret is nowhere close to powershifting.
---
Why the fuck  are A and W swapped?
---
yeah its most likely warmonger the zf sword has 2 ballz flying around it
---
so i also think its warmonger (great sword to lvl up with +3 hit is no joke)
---
i also recognize his chest and i think its the epic boe mail ice mail jerkin (or at least thats how it looks like)
---
I know how you can surprise him;)
---
I really like the concept of this dungeon as well as the artwork. I have also been a supporter of the idea of using items to help specs that function poorly in PvE, and think they are an interesting hook for players to do added content in a theoretical Classic+ server option.
---
It’s a cool idea to have the boss’ difficulty be determined by how many other bosses the party slays, offering strong parties the choice of taking him on earlier to get more loot from him. He could be too anticlimactic if players do a full clear and choose to take him last, but then they can only blame themselves. Even on a full clear, nothing forces you to take him last.
---
I suspect the Starfire Idol may be too unreliable. If it doesn’t proc before you run out of mana, which seems pretty likely, you are just screwed. Maybe it could have a higher proc chance and instead proc a small amount of mana or a mini Innervate. Items can always be adjusted, of course.
---
It would also be great to see your ideas for the trash mobs. I think it would be nice to see a lot of non-elementals for contrast to the bosses. Perhaps Kaizer the main forces comprise of Tauren guards, led by shamans who have been seduced by his power. The shamans could have some interesting totems the party has to deal with. And each area could have some appropriate elementals bolstering the more mundane forces. Fire elementals near The Boiler and so on.
---
This was my most wanted item for a while back in 2004 when I bought the official WoW strategy guide. I did not have WoW back then. The keyboard was being advertised in the back of the guide. I didn't even have a pc back then, so I didn't even need this keyboard. But it was the coolest thing ever back then. I was 10 in 2004. Ah, the good old days.
---
I did finally start wow in 2012, though! Read that strategy guide religiously
---
Hmm I also wonder about it. Ofc I wonder what it will look like from looking through a gun sight as it would be killed on sight at every opportunity.
---
I had one, never managed to get it to work though....
---
Murloc playable race when?
---
The world record is currently held by a boomer who
---
a) shaved 2 hours already off his 1-40 time, and
---
b) other players have crushed in 1-40 by 8 hours
---
That world record ain’t shit these days.
---
poweshifting is adequate. but you gotta farm gnomeregan for hours on a weekly basis.  
---
... 
---
to be adequate
---
I'll take my stress test after the 12th, thanks blizz.
---
The above theory is rather vaguely described and applied 2 broadly. It also describes how we all naturally have some of every type. Your choices merely show which ones you favor, so having two is nothing unusual. Am a psychology uni student and it tickles me 2
---
In what Vanilla was the DPS supply too low?
---
Classic will be exactly like other MMORPGs: extremely low number of tanks, very low number of healers, and a truckload of DPS.
---
It doesn't matter how many classes can tank, there won't be enough tanks, ever. Look at Retail. 6 classes can tank (which is damn stupid if you ask me, but that is not the point) yet there are not enough tanks. FFXIV as well, never enough tanks. 
---
I would say that out of 100 lvl 60 players , 10 will be tanks, 20 will be healers and 70 will be DPS. Most 5 men PuGs at lvl 60 will have non-tanks tanking, because there aren't enough tanks, and one of their DPS will have to tank if they want to actually do dungeons.
---
Which is not an issue, because any Warrior or Druid can tank 5 men just fine.
---
Druids are very good at healing, decursing and innvervate.
---
Rogues are very good at dealing dps. In fact it's a top dps.
---
Warlocks also deal good dps and becomes top DPS eventually, close to top in the mid-game but they bring soulstones and banish.
---
Priest, paladin and shaman are all suboptimal dps.
---
Hunters exist because of Tranquilizing Shot.
---
Druids who want to DPS do suboptimal dps. *Allegedly* they do adequate damage if they farm Gnomeregan for hours every week. *Not a meme spec by the way.*
---
Good old TSM scrollwheel buyout
---
Pre-raid content? you are vastly overestimating it... you can be in melee range using Stormstrike... I'll help you with a build shortly once I get home.
---
Got any examples ? I would like to learn from it.
---
So if someone codes an aimbot in CS you shouldn't ban them because they deserve to be able to cheat since they can code?
---
Come on dude it doesn't exactly take a computer science degree to hack together a script for botting the wow auction house, I'm sure many people who can't code would be capable of it.
---
It's not about what can be done, but whether it should be done, it's not really part of the game and if it requires any external modification to the game then it should be an instant ban, just like say having an auto-counterspell script.
---
Phase 2 for honour rewards. You won't get rank 10 lvling.
---
Awh :(
---
Reasons not to allow server transfer ( or not to do so lightly at least, and definitely not paid ones) include but are not limited to the above.
---
So many people will be streaming on launch. Good luck lol
---
Going to meal prep a bunch of chicken/rice/veggies on the Monday to see me through the first few days. Also getting a few treat foods for snacking.
---
I love playing the warrior, soldier, fighter, type classes in every game. There's something so awesome to me about just being a mortal with a weapon, fighting and defeating enemies that should be able to kill you, but your expertise in combat is what leads you to victory.
---
^^
---
Idk i've used to for so many years, cant remember when i thought of it.
---
I mean my guild was called Jokers and Smokers. It was very chill. I was a kid playing a troll rogue, using daggers and believing slice and dice not worth the CPs. We killed cthun and I got to see the inside of naxx before I had to stop. 
---
Casual guilds will get there 2, including with boomkins. They will just take far longer.
---
Unfortunately, as said previously, there are way more nodes on private servers and less people to compete with while leveling.
---
On official, it won't be possible to keep your gathering profs up to date without falling behind.
---
So even though you have done it, you won't be able to do it again during launch. A month or 2 after launch, it will become possible again because you you be competing with your entire server.
---
Being a successful steamer requires your to either have a very interesting personality or be extremely good at a game.
---
Problem with classic is that you really can't be extremely good at it. They leaves the entirety of your stream success on your personality.
---
Haha Yeha i Played 2 pserver launches just to see what is needed and raise with the Time got a Edit Note with (in my opinion)the best items/Mats for it x)
---
Yeah man I love the whole brd/brs area.  Some damn good pvp to be had around there too ;)
---
He didn't have a monopoly on silk, he had a monopoly on farmless silk, big difference in WoW.
---
Not in a million years no. I can only play about 5% of the class/race combination
---
Humans gain more rep, but it's cheating really.
---
Other than that, the height can only be a gameplay advantage.
---
&gt;I also think gnome suits the mage better roleplay wise
---
I'd argue otherwise. For example, Council of Tirisfal was founded by high elven mages; it included humans and gnomes as well, but for gnomes, we only know the name Indus. But it's not to discourage you from playing a gnome, they're indeed a bit of a placeholder race and not much represented in lore - but could a great hero like *you* change it..?
---
So is pure vanilla ice cream but here we are
---
Warrior - Because I like having a damage resource (rage) that scales ontop of itself and is generated by staying in combat, instead of mana which is basically the opposite. Also I prefer to wear plate and I enjoy taking and mitigating damage. I'm a melee-player in all games and I never really enjoyed being a spellcaster or any sort.
---
Seal Fate Prep? Without Improved Backstab?
---
You sound like an idiot. Because someone has the "skill" to create a bot, they should be allowed to? Compare this to literally anything illegal in real life and reevaulate your stupidity.
---
or be a none fat girl and show some cleaveage/tanktop
---
Class would be the toughest, but ye, would be fun to fall in love with shamans suddenly. Name of "Pwndildogodxx" wouldn't help, but then again, it's just a name.
---
Hes letting everyone know that he just came, and he was at work, so it was *inconvenient.*
---
You should be ashamed to even dare to ask. Everyone serious here knows you need at least a bachelor degree in MMO tanking to have the right to dream to tank in Classic. What a scrub.
---
Gnomes can run out the windows of the Loch Modan towers, Human males cannot (Human females can). Saves about 10 seconds each time.
---
Because I suck big time in PvP but as a shadow priest I can still beat 70% of the players in my level range
---
Protection Warrior. I like challenge, and leading a 5 men group or a raid, it's a challenge in Classic. I played tank in MMOs before WoW, and chose Warrior tank in Vanilla. Never changed my main since.
---
I can see myself as a healer (my main alt is a Resto Shaman) because I know when and what to heal, based on my experience as a tank.
---
I could never see myself as a DPS character in WoW, be it melee or ranged. It just doesn't click.
---
You're choosing a faction based on more low level dungeons?
---
I’d still play if I was forced to play with my feet instead of hands. So ya I’d play a random combo.
---
This is totally wrong...care to develop?
---
its just simulating real live, nobody gets banned using stock market bots either
---
should both be punishable by death anyway
---
 Tbh it looks amazing for left handed people
---
I use to love playing auction back in the days, but now it just not the same with all those add-on and YouTube video.
---
TO BE FAIR I STOLE IT FROM R/HEARTHSTONE.
---
How about always roll need on BoE epics in the first place?
---
Don't be a tard in 2019 or someone's going to enjoy buying their epic mount or BiS from the AH at your expense.
---
I like to be somewhat special but not a complete freak.
---
I am rolling feral druid tank.
---
Tyr’s hand is a nice place to farm as warrior/priest. Another place which is really good is the satyrs in Azhara if one of you have mining.
---
There will be a big audience around launch, but it will slowly tapper off.  The WoW streamer base is pretty saturated and established already, so you’re going to need to do something unique in game to distinguish you from all the other established options like master and become the face of a meme spec like Shedo did with feral cat Druids as one example.  I’d STRONGLY suggest you figure out what server the other big streamers are playing on and go there.  Will give you a chance at additional exposure if you’re able to network with them and end up featured some how on their streams.  If you’re really good at the game, doing something like winning a big streamer sponsored duel tournament could get you a boost in viewers.  Or running one of the top guilds in the game.  
---
The other way to gain viewers is if you’re personality is extremely likable / funny / relatable.  If this is your niche, the growth will be extremely slow but can still get you there if you’re willing to keep at it for years and you’re OK streaming for like 5 viewers consistently when starting.
---
If you don’t care about viewers, then just turn the camera on and do whatever you want.  You might end up with a viewer or two here and there on occasion.
---
Leveling cooking opens up some quests. So it is good for leveling.
---
Wait, so what is your suggestion on what should change? Going with a different class on the 35?
---
The alchemy on the druid idea is not just for arcanite every two days. It's also to make all of the consumables I listed in my earlier replies. With me being PvP focused in this game, I'm going to be burning through those as I play. As far as I can tell, then only thing I'll miss out on the druid being the alch are flasks.
---
With flasks (as you can tell in my earlier replies), I initially really wanted it. But then you spent your replies telling me they aren't needed in the raids I'll be doing, and that it would be a waste of a profession spot on either the mage or hunter. That coupled with the fact that my raiding guild will have a guild alchemist and I could just funnel mats to him if I ever got the itch for flasks, and then I'm good.
---
Im definitely open to suggestions here, it's just not clear what it is you're suggesting at this point.
---
Technically that's not being a streamer.
---
Actually i think that would be kinda neat
---
Especially because it's being legalized everywhere. Soon, it's going to be like bragging about smoking cigarettes.
---
the reason we in europe kinda need airconditions these days is probably cause you put it into everything without regard of efficients or isolations :&gt;
---
YOU'LL LIKELY NEED MORE THAN 20, SOME PEOPLE WON'T MAKE IT ON SOME RAID NIGHTS.
---
Shaman, just keep dropping totems for no reason
---
Try to make some friends.
---
I bought one that never worked. I stupidly never bothered to return it cause I was young and dumb.
---
And there is no "I want to play horde yet I want to hang out in SW" problem or vice versa. You can do both without any trouble (even more fun with a little trouble)
---
I believe there's a specific fight in... MC or BWL maybe... where gnomes don't get line of sight over a lip.
---
I have the faintest memory of this, but height may LoS you.
---
I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING YOU'RE HORDE AS  YOUR SPEECH IS SOMEWHAT INTELLIGENT
---
Paladins
---
Mage, warlock or paladin
---
Mage for the sweet leveling consistency and easy monies for food water and ports
---
Paladin so you get to experience the alliance only class experience, get a free 40 mount and cheaper 60 mount
---
Warlock for the pets and free 40 mount and cheap 60 mount but WotF makes them not as good for PvP on alliance
---
Expect to be the first person to each dungeon. Nobody ever wants to walk.
---
Probably. Hopefully the names would be RP names and not meme names.
---
Made me think about what i would hope i wouldnt get and nothing really stood out. Druids maybe. But then i thought i could be a really good hotw healer and flag carrier. Hunter, but i could own melee weaving and micro manage pet like a boss.
---
Tldr, tons of positives about every class. So yes. I would if it was the only way to play classic.
---
I played a Paladin in Vanilla. This time I'm doing the opposite. It's the soul reason I'm playing Shaman.
---
Get a good wand. Level tailoring and enchanting to craft lesser and greater magic wand (or buy from AH). 
---
A good wand (and the spirit tap talent) will save you from a lot of mana breaks. Especially while playing solo. In instances you can wand at the mobs between heals.
---
Yeah! You know it! Fuck these boomers, looking forward to using TSM in classic too, if it's even possible
---
I look forward to more.   
---
You've probably been asked to death, but I didn't see my first pass through: what do you use to make the maps? Just sampling colours and adding textures to replicate WoW's in photoshop? Or is there a tool I don't know of?
---
I never spent a ton of time in the AH, but I always made it a point to hold control over certain items that are frequently bought. It's basically how I made all my gold in wow, and I made a lot of gold back in the day. I remember a week after I dinged 60 my 2 friends did as well....i paid for their epic mounts. I would get mean whispers all the time of people cussing me out for the prices on the AH, and my guildies would call me Boss Tweed. So to answer your question yes.....I cant wait to run the AH again and buy my buddies mounts and whatever gear/consumes their hearts desire
---
Because of shadoweaving + improved shadowbolt debuff your spell power scaling on shadowbolt becomes the highest damage coefficient in the game. In full BIS a warlock spamming shadowbolt will do more damage than any other class.
---
I would be up for that.
---
Pretty cool idea anyhow.
---
It'd be interesting if you built a guild around it.  Get people to sign up on a forum thread, collect names, then use some random generator to spit out Race/Class for each name, and post 'em to the thread, so everyone knows what everyone's sposed to play as.
---
I dropped a big sandwich with eggs shrimp and mayonnaise on mine. I was sooo happy about the removable insert. I just took the insert to the sink and washed it all off!
---
Technically no
---
When I first started playing halfway through WotLK (yeah call me a wrath baby whatever) I went Horde I played a Tauren Druid and Blood Elf Paladin. 
---
Around Cata I switched over to alliance playing a priest main and have been alliance up until Legion where I made a Forsaken Mage
---
I will be rolling Horde-side when Classic launches with an Orc Lock and a Tauren Warrior.
---
Yeah I'm fully prepared to play my home north american server at launch from brasil =(
---
I find that DS/Ruin is better than SM/Ruin for farming Maraudon.
---
If you sacrifice Voidwalker (Fel Stamina) right after killing the Goblin boss you can get full HP/Mana before you reach the Princess and engage the boss immediately.
---
There is also a pack of worms that you need to kill and that's just a lot faster with 3/3 Imp Voidwalker shield + helllfire.
---
Princess also dies faster because Fel Stamina (the DS buff) gives more HP than Siphon Life which means you can Life Tap more often and use more spells.
---
The fact that summons cost 50% less mana and only take 5 seconds also cuts down on waiting time when farming.
---
&gt; is like wow, that's a genuinely impresively bad idea :P
---
You have impressed me with your majestic way of decribing bad!
---
There was a lot more buttons on my TBC one that wasn't directly bound, like party invite, duel, trade and so on. It was awesome for a while :)
---
And try to get lots of mage water before instance, because it really sucks to not get the full worth of the water you have purchased.
---
Random class/race/name? Sure. Random alliance/Horde side? No way!
---
For the Horde.
---
Easier access to each capital, shaman windfury, access to the shaman class, WotF and cannibalize, Orc stun resist, Tauren +2 yard range.
---
And we're comrades + really cool people. Come join the Horde we have mana biscuits
---
Tons of good tips here. Mine is to ignore people that are mean to you. There are people who will flip their shit over the most minor thing. Put them on ignore and move on.
---
When doing group content, ask if you are unsure about things. Most people love to share their knowledge.
---
Shields are even becoming less required.
---
Gnomes don't deserve rights.
---
&gt; Thinking 20/31/0
---
Super OP in duels.
---
I play de gnome to kill de horde
---
Vanilla is actually a very complicated flavor
---
Get him some new equipment maybe?  New ergonomic computer chair or mouse/keyboard?  
---
Small fridge with drinks   
---
Wow posters, tshirts or memorobilia  
---
Piss bottles
---
Sure
---
Orc. The stun resist even deters gankerrogues from attacking you.
---
I mean I would see what I get. If I got certain class/race combos I would not do it though. Tauren druid comes to mind.
---
exactly
---
Healing pug ubrs runs are usually much more challenging than healing in MC.
---
Defcamp &amp; Melderon for the shaman guides and egregious as well - check out classicwow.live it's a site run by a few content creators who are mostly horde folks and thus have more shaman content than would be otherwise.
---
I WANT TO FOCUS ON ONE MAIN AND ONE ALT...BUT I CAN'T PICK BETWEEN PRIEST, SHAMAN OR WARLOCK. I KNOW IF I DON'T PICK SOON,  I'M GONNA GET STICK IN THE 1-20 CYCLE AND QUIT THE GAME SOON AFTER.  
---
SO... I'VE DECIDED MY SOLUTION IS TO DO A WOW-FAST FROM 8-1 UNTIL LAUNCH FOR SOME MENTAL CLARITY.   NO RETAIL.  NO PSERVER. NO MORE GUIDES OR "WHAT SHOULD I PLAY" POSTS... POSSIBLY NO POSTS AT ALL UNLESS FROM A BLUE.    THAT'S RIGHT BOYS,  I'M NOFAPPING WOW UNTIL LAUNCH.
---
Well that's good to hear. Whenever I read up on group composition, they always suggest 5 different classes and no duplicate classes.
---
Nah, warrior or bust for me.
---
Get grid or luna or something like that, and minimize the frame as much as possible, then it is not an issue. You will play «wack-a-mole» though in raids.
---
Any mount you ride that’s not a Mechanostrider is oversized and feels extremely sluggish and slow. It’s actually the main reason I’ll never play a gnome again. 
---
I do like the Mechanostrider, though
---
Being 19.
---
Finding groups as dungeon dps is easy as a warlock. 
---
Of course it is easier as a healer but it's not bad as a warlock. 
---
You'll always have to summon two people to the dungeon. I take it as a luxury so I don't have to wait too long for others.
---
Improved Shadowbolt and Ruin.
---
My auction house toon was named Ebay
---
You'd best be the most unique snowflake in the world, because everyone and his dog will be trying to become Internet-famous by showing others how they play one of the most popular MMO games ever. Why would people click your stream in Twitch?
---
You never ever take lightwell. That talent is the most useless shit ever.
---
TSM said they're not porting their addon over until they *know* there is a demand for it.  At which point if you're waiting on that you can fall behind.  AUX however is verified for Classic and looks and feels similar to TSM.
---
Yep! I'm currently streaming myself doing an Iron Challenge on live (#shill twitch.tv/akaphil) and randomised every part of my character for that. Race, gender, class, spec, looks and name. In this situation I think it adds to the challenge cause I can't be guaranteed a class I know well, but I've also taken the same approach when leveling with friends in the past or playing with new people and helping them get into the game.
---
I've also been thinking about doing this for my first alt in Vanilla. I'm going to be playing a Tauren Shaman, that's locked it, but I kinda want an alt souly focused on PvP and for that going completely random might be fun.
---
Or maybe it's the human males just look like females of every race.
---
Oh ok I didn't know. Thanks for explaining! I'll check out AUX. U didn't know about it
---
First off - WELCOME!!!!
---
I would try to ease your way into the game via maybe checking out some youtube channels dedicated to vanilla wow theorycrafting (theorizing about the game to come) and nostalgic memories (bringing back stories of interesting things about the game).
---
1. Don't ninjaloot
---
2. Do a bit of research into what stats you want to prioritize
---
3. Save your money. A mount will be a 100 gold investment at level 40 and a 1000 gold investment at level 60.
---
Everything else about the game you will learn as you play.
---
Orc is a nobrainer: Stun resist and you don't have to fight Will of the Forsaken.
---
Gotta appreciate Joana and his contributions to the community, but he can't really match the new generation of poopsocking speedrunners when it comes to efficiency.
---
Yeah, I very much doubt this is from 2006
---
It really do be like that sometimes...
---
But at least I've found a nice bingo game
---
Do you want Captain Planet? Because THIS is how you get Captain Planet.
---
I have to do the same macro on my corsair k95 without the artwork. (fr keyboard tu es français?)
---
sounds like a win win
---
Yeah I used TSM a lot on retail and when I saw the news that it wont be in a launch (possibly ever) I was sesrching for something to fill the void.
---
depends on the streaming plaform i guess
---
Only about 30% of your server will reach max level. This has held true in actual vanilla, tbc, and every pserver.
---
&gt;  I just expect a lot of "raiders" are going to be a bit disappointed.
---
Well, if our current private server is anything to go by, after a couple of months a lot of people are still going to level. When people were asking for BWL release, the argument often brought forward was that "the majority is still levelling".  
---
I just hope Blizzard isn't going to "wait" on people, because that actually killed some raiding guilds. However, I am absolutely sure the phases will be released much slower than raiders would like either way.
---
One thing to consider: Someone levelling too slowly doesn't really matter for the people doing content at max level.
---
I had about 12 hard drives sitting around a few months back. I had thought my archives were lost, and got pretty emotional when I found them!
---
&gt; if the enemy team has atleast 2 mages its over 
---
I don't think you understand; in OP's scenario, it's 10 rogues v 10 rogues.
---
So many people mention the fishing; it probably has to happen again :)
---
What about 10 rogues v 10 rogues?
---
Oh yeah... I'm a little slow
---
&gt; Read the quest text
---
Why? Most of them are terribly written, or at least incredibly boring and generic.
---
I'm guessing you also spam Barrens chat looking for Mankrik's wife.
---
Thank you!
---
I've actually seen "waves" form on private servers, it corresponds to your calculations. Wave 1: First a couple of people hit 60, then their guild mates (40+ hours per week) and they start raiding around week 3-5.  
---
Wave 2: Eventually, a second wave of people (30 hours a week) hit 60 and fill the last slots in the raiding guilds or form more casual guilds.  
---
Wave 3: Then more people (~20 hours a week), usually accompanied by the alts of the people from the first wave, hit 60 but usually can't commit to proper raiding guilds due to their limited time available. This often causes the alts of wave 1 people to host pugs.  
---
Everyone levelling after that will have it a lot harder.
---
Because levelling speed often corresponds to how much time you can put into the game it often also results in you ending up in different kinds of guilds. Being "behind" on levelling also means you're "behind" on gear and having limited time available makes it very hard to catch up.  
---
I think that's a huge part of the reasons why people are planning on rushing to 60 so hard. I'll probably hit 60 around the end of week 3 and we'll raid soon after, but I won't kill myself pushing for that.
---
Thanks for the heads up! Should be fixed now.
---
Why are you reposting this?
---
There's SO much wrong shit here.
---
1) the time-cost of gathering is the time spent running to/from, and the time to loot itself... Usually, it's gonna be at least 20 seconds. 20 seconds x 200 skill levels, that's  more than 66 mins added time by lvl 40 where you aren't getting xp. 
---
2) the time-cost of gathering is reduced heavily once you get mount, as you will have increased speed. This means that it's more efficient to level gathering profs AFTER leveling. If you have to kill nearby mobs to get the node, you will be able to do that much faster when you are +30 levels.
---
3) ore and herb nodes are not shared, so the 500+ other people rolling mining at server start will be taking your nodes anyway.
---
It is true
---
You forgot: “The way we used the internet in 2005 is suddenly back.”
---
Too many people believe this will happen.
---
I love the self awareness of the traditional free space
---
They didn’t have shadowmend until much later than bc

"As a child, Edward loved stabbing things. So once he found 2 knives on the same day, his life was never the same. From then on, he was a Rogue."

This photoshop template is a really nice base for making wow maps.  https://model-changing.net/files/file/36-world-map-template/ You draw the map with black and white masks and can get pretty far. I have a lot of custom details for each map hand painted on top. Give it a go. ;)

TRIGGERED!!!!!
---
Love it!!! Now that’s a good toaster!!!;)
---
HAHA NOW YOU'VE DONE IT. NOW IM GOING TO PLAY HUMAN WARRIOR TOO.
---
Oh if we played this in school back in the day while I was playing wow, my mind would have been blown.
---
Also forgot “am I the only one that’s gonna take my time and enjoy leveling??”
---
I’m not talking about a scarcity of streamers, I’m talking about the scarcity of content.
---
When only a few thousand people in the world got in, people will watch the worst streamer ever just because they want to see the content.
---
Some body do me;)
---
hunters underperform in every area even if played properly. Barely anyone will play them properly.
---
Soul Harvester has +hit.
---
That makes it pretty much preBiS if it's out in phase 1.
---
/roll holy warrior it is
---
I accept your challenge sir
---
THANK YOU THAT DOES HELP
---
Truth is we don't know. I agree with you, that Classic (whether it's grinding explicitly or any other content) is usually not great to view, unless the streamer brings something to the table.
---
Goes for most games though.
---
Guess time will tell.
---
The trinket is not useful at all.
---
It will end up in your bank doing nothing. At least you get good use out of the staff because it has +hit.
---
This is from a current pserver, Hexxhaxx is one of the most spastic players I’ve ever met. Constant shouting of twitch memes, omegalul, pepega, etc. 
---
All the Asmongold classics.
---
Almost everyone will use linen for first aid.
---
Oh that one would‘ve been good!
---
Absolutely. Good point about Shadow Priests.
---
there are only advantages :
---
you need less food/ water  
---
you are smarter  
---
you are cute, so the tank will let you ride  on his shoulders on those long travels to AQ or Onyxia  
---
a 16 slot bag works like a 28 slot bag, since your stuff is gnome sized, it can hold more
---
So are locks, thinking they are viable compared to mages ;) second fiddle caster
---
Answer to most of these is no.
---
Wouldn't bother with robe of the void unless you're very hardcore (only 5 damage over robe of winter night). I reckon herbalism would be good to go with engineering.
---
I believe there were be 16 debuff spots at launch.  And I also don’t know the answer to your question.
---
I had the Battlefield 2 one... oh the memories.
---
I've got bad news for you... This is in classic..
---
Thanks guys! And the stun proc will be a help for solo content/ emergency tanking
---
how can shards be *this* much of a struggle that this is actually useful?
---
Isn't Hand of Salv paladins and fear ward priests quite in demand in vanilla?

Btw you're arguing with Shadow Panther, who was basically the OG rogue theorycrafter in vanilla and invested the AEP [agility equivalence points] (what we now know as stat weights) system.

I'm not saying he/she is right or wrong, but just that he/is knows their stuff.

Yeah, I agree with the poster above that 2 locks is probably ideal if you’re going to run 2 casters. I mained a lock and it was pretty smooth sailing.

Pink ponytailed gnome or dwarf female are the go to’s for horde mains.

Just means you prefer aesthetics over gameplay advantages.

Paladin is probably the most braindead class in the game, next to mages. 1 healing spell that you spam. That’s it. Ret and prot are trash specs.

You’re not missing out on anything.
---
Polearms would be equitable to a rifle. A sword would be equitable to a pistol.
---
There are still lots of possibilities but everyone wanted a 5x5 so I had to work with 25 fields
---
This is great but is gunna get removed because it mentions private servers
---
Best one yet!
---
I used to make a lot of many on the AH up to Legion when I stopped playing, but making a fortune in Classic will not be easy. Most people know that they shouldn't buy unnecessary things during leveling. There are some items that can be valuable, but I assume there are a lot of players who knows about them. I assume it will be more difficult this time.
---
On the other hand, this time I will not equip the BoE epic world drop 1h weapon with +Def on my Rogue.
---
It's like if we won't be able to play if addons aren't here all working for the release :o. I think i'll survive few days/weeks without addons.
---
Anyway, good job
---
“WhAt iS tHiS? A bAtTlE sTaTiOn FoR AnTs?!”
---
Nothin wrong with keepin it minimal, but yeah you might at least want something soft for your bum?
---
What are you even saying? 
---
Sure if they deal the damage they promise, thats good and all. That's a pretty big "if", by the way. 
---
Feral dps sucks as a raid class and thats just the bottom line. Unless the person farms Gnomer for hours every week. Then the the damage is okay-ish. *GREAT CLASS* 👌
---
... Like... If you play this way what are you even doing? It's obviously stupid but each to their own.
---
For the story? Blizzard created an entire world with interwoven story lines that can stretch over many zones and take hours to complete. Why do you go into the Deadmines and kill VanCleef? What is he doing down there? Why?...I know what the typical response will be though. "Cuz I needz gear, bruh!"

Well as a hunter I’m tapping into my inner Legolas 🧝‍♂️ 
---
✅ Elves.
---
✅ Beauty 
---
✅ Arrows.
---
✅ Sweet jumps.
---
I think it says I’m a badass. 
---
Also I really like cats.
---
Highly amusing
---
Last time I checked, the *mention* of private servers was fine. They exist, it's a fact. I repeat that this guide physically cannot be used to set one up.
---
Nah evening saying the name of them can get you gassed
---
EU. I am in kenya now and made the switch recently from my old north american account. The latency is less than 1/2 it was consistently (now 145-160ms from 300-600). The game is waaay more fun now obvi
---
&gt; The spread sheet is wrong.
---
Could you please elaborate? I would like to understand why it is wrong.
---
&gt; There is about a 3-5% dps increase with Combat Daggers. Combat Swords and SF Daggers are about the same output. For purely PvE I would go combat Swords before I went SF Daggers, but combat Daggers is definitely dps king.
---
That was a bit fast ... So combat swords = SF Daggers &lt; combat daggers? How so? From what I have (always) read combat swords &gt; combat daggers.
---
And swords is not an option, I am set on daggers (even for pure PvE) and just want to know how SF Daggers compare to Combat Daggers and the reason why either of them is better. And of course, why the spreadsheet is giving me results that contradict everything I have read.
---
No. I tried it, made money off it. Quit it.
---
It's just not fun for me, I'd rather be out in the world either grinding mobs or running a dungeon instead of sitting around looking at cheap 3rd party lua in my RPG.
---
I think I'm just gonna do my scans once or twice a day and then sell stuff I hoard when appropriate, not gonna sit there for hours on end.
---
Blackjack isnt something im in any way good at. I see it as an (expensive) bit of entertainment while I'm having a couple beers at the pub on a friday night. I always put in the lowest amount of money that was allowed (200 SEK/21 USD) and always bet the minimum amount (40 SEK) each round. I considered that money lost the moment the transaction was complete, and then just tried to hang on for as long as possible. I didnt even bother to even try to count cards or anything like that, I was more focused on having a good time and keeping the conversation with my friends up.
---
One way to be the best at wow is to learn all classes.
---
If you are horde you also get wind fury in your main hand. Not sure if this counts though lol

I didn’t look it up it was just my intuition saying this. Warmonger still a great wp though.
---
Random me baby!
---
Mainly because shadow oil + spellpower flask are more expensive than just slapping on the instant poison. Also, I am not sure how strong shadow oil will actually be on classic. Afaik it has only been tested on p-servers.
---
Hm, I edited it slighlty. I still think the concept itself is perfectly legal.
---
Yeah I get that. The thread comments works fine for any extras.
---
This is a pserver lmao. I know like 2 of the players in this image
---
Of course, addons were never mandatory, but some would prefer to get them done in advance and not waste precious gametime :)
---
Lol fucking Voldemort kinda shit right there.
---
I went camping last weekend when it was 43 C
---
Agreed. Classic is dead and stuff
---
This is just so awesome. This should’ve been in the game from the way beginning!
---
That flat reduction is up to lvl 40 on the beta testing, and the graph is going UP with higher crit, which absolutely makes if percentage based, not flat valued.
---
Looking at the data from lvl 40 testing, and the graph, there is a clear path that the more crit you have, the more crit you lose, and it is around 1/3rd of the crit on the tooltip in the Spell Book.
---
Even if it's going to be a bit lower than 30%, let's say 25%, Druids will still lose far too much Threat, because of Maul Crit to threat correlation, while Prot Warriors will be almost untouched by a 25% loss in Crit.
---
A white Shield Slam generates almost (about 90%) the same Threat as a Crit Shield Slam. Revenge crits are irrelevant, a White revenge Threat is 99.99% of a Crit Revenege (because Revenge damage is extremely low). Sunders are Sunders, zero threat loss because it doesn't do any damage. 
---
Heroic Strike white damage or crit damage does virtually the same threat 
---
So, the best 3 Threat abilities for Prot Warriors lose ZERO threat (Sunder or Revenge) and Shield Slam loses a 10% on white damage. With Shield Slam on a 6 second CD, even if ALL the hits will be white, the loss in total Threat for a Prot Warrior, when counting in Sunder (on GCD) and Revenge (5 seconds CD) is around 4%. Adding in Heroic Strike (GCD, replace an auto-attack hit) Prot Warriors might lose 5-6% Threat, if they lose 25% critical of their Spell Book Crit Chance value.
---
Bears , with the same 25% loss will lose close to 35% Threat, because additive Threat is a double edge sword : it is amazing with high Crit, but the loss of Threat per point of Crit loss become higher and higher with each Crit % loss.
---
I'm not concerned. I'll expect the next "announcement" from the Classic team after the world first race is done and the free 3-day-gift is expired on everyone's account.
---
I HAVE LITERALLY 1,729 MOUNTS ON RETAIL AND NOW I'M STARTING WITH ZERO AND HORDE DOESN'T EVEN GET A WINTERSPRING KITTY MOUNT EQUIVALENT BECAUSE IT WAS ADDED LATER, GAHHHH
---
LOK'TAR MCFREAKING OGAR
---
Are they allowed to delay WoW Classic? They said that it would release in the summer of 2019, so surely there must be some law forcing them to release the game on time. Although I could be extremely wrong.
---
The stress test is happening lol
---
That’s /r/wowcirclejerk 
---
A CJ but lowkey mad their retail raids will be totally derailed on Aug 27 
---
You hate to see it
---
I mean, everyone would just make new accounts until they got what is BiS :D
---
Maybe the internal testers can't clear MC
---
I may be overly optimistic, but I can't see them delaying a launch. The shitstorm would be too big, way bigger if there're simply disconnects/bugs.
---
It’s a setup for the eventual subtle-brag about still being a low level a couple weeks in.
---
Reminds me of Cloud Strife. Up the textures and it looks like a poster for ff. Thanks for sharing this!

YOU'RE A MASOCHIST,

WE'RE ALL MASOCHISTS

This is actually kinda sick lmao

Vanilla* Classic isn't out yet.
---
i wouldn't be surprised if august comes and goes and we don't hear anything about anything and then somebody at blizzcon asks where's classic and they like 'oh, we forgot about that'
---
I was aiming more for socially, wow forums and guild chat as the only means of communication etc.
---
Only if you rebind ESC to a skill
---
That’s it. I’m rolling gnome.
---
I HAVE KIND OF A BUSY SCHECULE BUT I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND AND I WILL PLAY WITH YOU.
---
IT'S CLASSIC, YOU'RE NEVER ALONE BUDDY, EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY
---
Really buggy  NPCs who get upset every time someone writes in chat and vote kick players as soon as their dps is 5% under the average
---
I got to say that the female Troll is one of the few race models that I think kept their charm when they added the new models. Other races such as Nelf, Belf and Human just don't look the same to me.
---
The dismounting problem is actually pretty annoying, my alt was a gnome rogue. There are a lot of semi-shallow bodies of water out there.
---
What about the good ol': "3 wives, 5 kids, demanding job oh and bills, don't forget the bills, that leaves me only 2 hours per month to play"
---
that'll do pig
---
Wow this meme is completely incomorehensible because OP called it the wrong word
---
You literally cannot jump as high as other races and can get stuck in certain places as s result. If you plan on going engineering gnome is even more BIS though.
---
Thank you :) I was too young then... I'll however make sure to update it for Classic TBC if it ever happens!
---
The outcry from everyone who took 2 weeks PTO.. kek
---
whY nOt buY a new cHair tho?
---
Damn son, Now you'll never need to scour your keyboard looking for what button to press to open Talents, because you have your very own button just for that!
---
For some people, the rush is exactly how to play the game and enjoy it.  Why do you think twitch is always lit up by speedrun streams?
---
Pretty unlikely. They are more likely to release a bugged game and fix bugs afterwards, like they did with Vanilla as well.
---
I wish classic+ was just increasing the level cap to 70, give us bc talents, but no outland. Like just develop azeroth more, we can still have karazhan and caverns of time. Maybe give us the dragon isles. Maybe give us a pvp zone like wintergrasp. To deal with flight path times, maybe give us a quest chain at 70 to increase flight path speed by 50%, or a new ground mount speed of like 125%. Also never put achievements or dailies in the game and make it so item levels dont jump so much so you can draw out more content without as much power creep. I'm spitballing here but those first 2 expansions had a lot of good stuff in them, but a lot of bad as well, if we could cherry pick itd be amazing.
---
No i did not buy this. I bought the giant tank of a mouse they released years ago.
---
Let's hope not, I mean, it's not even about an illegal *server*, it's just about how to see a bit more of your *client* than the loadscreen...
---
Layering doesn’t affect the total amount of players on 1 server .....................
---
Thanks Dad.
---
WoW, I had no idea those existed.
---
It all depends on gear. Find the average heal without crits and divide it by the mana cost of that rank, this is healed/mana. Do this for each rank of a spell and you will find the most mana efficient rank of that spell.
---
It's called LIFEBOOK, i think that... ironic.
---
Took 3 weeks off work on rather short notice, so if they delay it now, I will be very dissapointed.
---
Normaly I'd be in the "Release it when it's ready" camp, but at this point I'd rather deal with bugs and DCs, than have it delayed
---
I bought a G15 and a G510 off Kijiji for cheap in prep for the return of Vanilla.  Also dusting off the G13.
---
I hate what they did with the female trolls and taurens.
---
How about I have (self diagnosed myself with) BPD, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and WoW saved my life?
---
Might give life to the old saying 'the higher level in game, the lower level in real life'
---
There's no magic but no client modification either. You just launch a program that puts files of the client together to create a sandbox world.
---
I however agree that it is subtle, and would understand if someone treats it as ToS violation (I still think it is not).
---
&gt; 3 weeks*
---
Very good cable management my dude
---
If you actually play on this, i do feel bad for your back and ass.
---
Picking up the quests is correct. Heading straight to echo isles is a death wish.
---
wtf was this shit supposed to do?
---
Wotlk had the most fun class speccs for me. Classic + but with wotlk abilities would be the dream.

pet to harass a caster, slowing trap, conc shot and wing clip to help kite melee and flares+hunters mark for stealthy bastards
---
No, Horde or die. I'm not taking a 50/50 chance on rolling a filthy Alliance character.

But they're still not hunched over monsters like the male trolls
---
If they do that they might as well start burning piles of money.

They wotf you death coil

Since you are smaller people will have to tab target you (advantage) but also your teammates may have to ally tab target to heal you, which happens less often (disadvantage)

Only if everyone on the server would have to do it too

It ain’t much, but it’s an honest station.
---
Played a survival hunter in classic, but luckily i wasnt old enough to understand what dps was.
---
Oooh sweet, thanks.  
---
I'm gonna give it a go manually, and if that doesn't work out well then I know where to go!
---
&gt;I have a soft spot for beautiful females

Dear lord. How many fedoras do you own?

Old, no.

But I bought a razor orb-weaver to replace my old Belkin Nostromo Speedpad n52 when BFA launched and I decided to give it a try, and I'm happy it won't end up being a waste.
---
The best part bout classic, the game is the leveling. Im going to do rogue solo amd when my friend is on level a priest with his warlock. The real raiding starts in AQ and naxx and a casual player you should easly made rank 10
---
I'm pretty sure Auction Houses and Battlegrounds are cross server in Classic.
---
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Titan's Grip ruined warriors for me. Makes arms feel inferior thematically.

I would have the biggest headache is actually uldaman, but that can be alleviated if you just run it at 40 for the disc quest when you have a mount and you'll need kargath anyway as horde.

ME NOT THAT KIND OF ORC

&gt;Hex does effectively the same thing for trolls except provided the 20% MS effect at rank 1.

&gt;Shadowguard will outdps devouring plague by a factor of 3-4 in a long fight
---
You talking PVE? Because SG requires you to be hit and if you're taking enough hits in a boss fight to make SG outdps DP... Then you're doing it wrong.
---
Unfortunately you gotta trust me on this one. Blizzard will get a huge cash influx from the Classic WoW audience, meaning that they will FOR SURE do their best to drag it out for as long as they can. Anything other from a business standpoint would be just pure stupidity. Also taking into account that at todays Blizzard, appearantly activsion does all of the money hungry decisions, hence why this will 110% surely happen. Me being a Classic wow lover myself got no problems with it but I do indeed see your point when it comes to guilds that want faster progression tend to die out or merely raidlog which in turn leaves the world not as "vibrant" with people.
---
I don't preorder anything from anybody, not even cd projekt red.

I’m legit getting less than that some days today.  I think it was 0.32 yesterday.

For every 1 person who’s into speedleveling and optimization, there are like 20 players who could not care less. It’s just a vocal minority, and should have very little effect on how you play the game.

Ew, Vista.

How about, in classic i was still just an adventurer not a hero, just an adventurer adventuring my way through the world having many adventures
---
Wait rp-pvp servers?
---
Wtf?
---
OP didn't say your spec was randomized as well. It's safe to assume once you're character is created you are free to play the resulting randomness any way you choose.
---
How is that ironic?
---
Graphics are great. [this was my awesome graphic skill during vanilla ](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZgNJId3) for depicting a lock picking rogue.
---
Well eh leveling going to be easier than private servers and a lot are taking time off work (personally I'm taking 2 weeks PTO because I can) so who knows I'm guessing around 1)4
---
And Karen made some bad ones
---
Well its the same thing with everything. If you dont put the effort in, you wont reach your goal.
---
I still have my zboard!
---
You need a healer.  Paladins &amp; Priests can dispel/cleanse which is incredibly important but a druid with stealth would pair well with the rogue.
---
&gt; The current thought for classic is that Impale tanking is basically dead with the loss of crit 
---
Those people are wrong, and here is why :
---
There are 3 acceptable Threat tanks : Fury Warriors, Druids and Impale Prot Warriors. The first 2, Fury and Druid tanks, heavily rely on high crit, for their Threat. Fury Warriors need high crit, so they Flurry uptime is as high as possible, and Druids need high crit because Maul threat increases with crit increase. This is a double edged-sword for Fury and Druids, which gain more Threat with more Crit, but lose more threat with less crit. Their Threat scales up with higher crit chance...but also scales down with lower crit chance.
---
The Impale Prot Warriors gain 20% Damage for all their Critical Damage. However, most Threat that Prot Warriors, in general, dish out, comes from skills, and not from damage. Sunder Armor will always have the same Threat, since it is a debuff and does no Damage. Impale or not, Sunder Threat is unaffected.
---
Revenge, which is the best Threat per rage, have almost no damage. It doesn't matter if you land a 50 damage Revenge or a 100 crit damage Revenge, you lose 50 Threat, which is laughable. As Impale, you lose 70 threat, which is also laughable. Revenge is on a 5 seconds CD, which means that you lose, as Impale Prot specced, 14 threat per second.
---
Shield Slam. The Threat loss is higher on Shield Slam. A white SS of 350 vs a crit SS of 700 or 840, is a solid Threat loss (490 Threat), but with Shield Slam on a 6 seconds CD, the loss is, as Impale Prot specced, 81 Threat per second.
---
If your Crit chance, as Impale Prot Warrior, is 50% in the Spell Book (with Threat gear and all buffs), and real Crit chance, (after crit aura suppression) is 35%, your loss Threat will be as following : 
---
\-For Shield Slam, instead of 1 Shield Slam Crit every 12 seconds, you will have 1 Shield Slam Crit every 18 seconds. So, every 18 seconds, you lose 1 SS Crit, hence, you lose 490 threat (based on the figures I used), which translates into 27-28 TPS loss.
---
\-For Revenge, the same, you will lose 1 Revenge crit every 18 seconds, which is a 6-7 TPS loss.
---
\-Sunder retains the same threat.
---
So, a TPS loss of 34 to 35, when Sunder Armor, Revenge and Shield Slam are accounted, which are the highest Threat generators for Prot Warriors.
---
For Heroic Strike, and White Auto-attacks vs HS Crits and WA Crits, the calculation is much more complex, depending on Weapon used, attack speed, buffs, debuffs, glancing Blows, but it is fairly safe to assume that the TPS loss from HS + WA, due to loss of Crit, as Impale Prot Specced,  is less than Revenge + Shield Slam. But let's say that it is the same loss, around 34-35 TPS loss.
---
Accounting for Sunder Armor, Revenge, Shield Slam, Heroic Strike and White Auto-attacks, an Impale Prot Warrior will lose roughly 70 TPS, due to crit aura suppression.
---
I don't see how Impale Prot Warriors in Classic will be "basically dead", with a 70 TPS loss (which is a 3-5% TPS loss compared to pservers).
---
Due the same calculations for Fury Warriors and Druids, and the numbers are a nightmare for them. Flurry uptime 30% lower. Maul crits, 30% lower. 
---
Fury Warrior meta : high crit = high damage output = high Threat. Losses 30% of it's pserver crit chance. Losses more than 30% of the damage. Losses 25-26% of its Threat (because for Fury, Threat is almost point per point of Damage Done).
---
Druid meta : high crit = high Maul Crits = Additive Higher Threat from Maul crits = high Threat. Losses 30% of it's pserver crit chance. Losses more than 30% damage, (but losses less Threat than Fury), around 15-17% TPS loss vs 25-26% TPS loss in case of Fury.
---
When you draw the line, Impale Prot Warrior tanks will lose 3-5% TPS in Classic vs pservers, Fury tanks will lose 25% TPS and Druids around 15-17% TPS loss in Classic vs pservers.
---
I don't know which of the above 3 is "basically dead", given the conditions in Classic vs Pservers. And that is for TPS only. 
---
We still don't know how the glancing blows mechanics are different in Classic vs pservers, we don't know the algorithms for the RNG of Attack Table is working in Classic vs pservers. We know that lvl 63 mobs in Classic will have 14% Parry vs 5.6% vs pservers, which is a death sentence for Fury Warriors, and hurtful enough for Druids, but not so much for Prot Warriors (Deep or Impale speeced).
---
The conclusion is quite clear : 
---
Fury Warriors will lose 25-26% TPS in Classic just from the crit aura suppression (with 14% parry vs 5.6% they will lose even more TPS, while being highly open to being 2 shotted), making the fights at least 30% longer, which will have their healers go oom before the boss is dead.
---
Druid tanks don't lose as much TPS as Fury tanks, but they still lose 15-17% of their pserver TPS, which already puts them on par with Impale Prot tanks, while being pummeled by 14% parry-haste bosses, not being in the same risk of dying as Fury tanks, but clearly receiving more damage and will put a heavy string on their healers.
---
Impale Prot tanks lose 3-5% TPS in Classic, putting them on top of the TPS metters, for tanks, while being uncrusable and uncritable (no damage spikes), receiving far less damage that Fury tanks and Druids (which means less strain on the healers).
---
This is how it was in Vanilla 1.12, and I simply cannot understand why pserver players are UNABLE to realize that Classic is going to be Vanilla 1.12.
---
Impale Prot Warriors will be the best TPS tank in Classic AND having, by far, the highest survivability of all tanks...because we get Vanilla 1.12 and not pservers 1.12.
---
Well nice stealing and Photoshop skills ;-) 
---
But I still like it
---
My dad bought one. I’m not sure if he has it still, but it’s funny to see this keyboard after I almost forgot it excited completely
---
Its missing "which race for shadowpriest" and "what professions should I take"
---
[deleted]
---
Missing "what surprised you about your class" or some other lame attempt at re-wording "what should I play" to prevent getting a shitty low-effort question deleted.
---
If you level fast as a hunter you will always be managing different things. Levels 1-5 the mobs are weak so you can pull multiple at the same time and since melee and ranged attack timers aren't shared you can tab between the mob that reaches you melee and ranged attacking a new one. You also have to be constantly moving between shots from 1-12 to make sure you are maximising damage by getting as many ranged attacks off as possible. Later on you will be managing your pet, using hunters mark, arcane shot, concussive shot, multi-shot, serpent sting, switching between your Aspects and even setting up traps for big pulls. They're also the fastest levelers- you mostly shred through mobs with your pet tanking the damage (and then regening extremely fast out of combat, or with mend pet).  They can also pull off things other classes can't do because they are so versatile with slows, traps and having a pet. Their rotation is one of the more entertaining ones at max lvl too. 
---
If not hunter, I would suggest druid since they are also extremely versatile and you have many different options of things to do during a fight. They also have pretty small down-time between fights because they can quickly heal then switch back into form to continue fighting. They are one of the fastest levelers too and at max lvl, healing has you always doing something during fights.
---
NEIN
---
&gt;Fuck everyone starts even equal but noone has the given birth right to experience everything in the game and getting things handed to him with catchup mechanics or "easy modes" for high end content.
---
If you have money irl you can buy gold and buy dungeon/raid carries from guilds who have content on farm so you can gear up and see endgame content much quicker.
---
WoTLK was when WoW started its journey to the dark side. 
---
TBC just needs flying removed.
---
Which race for shadow priest is a big miss! Thanks for the reminder!
---
Bear druid? Like a warrior but you can also hot your friend while he lifetaps.
---
Druid, if played properly, has some of the least downtime of any class.
---
Druids have the advantage of having three different resources to work with: HP, Mana, and Energy/Rage.  Utilizing all three of these well makes for some of, if not the most, efficient leveling in the game.
---
I wish I had proof :(. Guess you'll just have to take my word for it.
---
12 year old me thought it was pretty sweet though since my first 60 was a warlock.
---
Sure. I like all the classes anyway so wouldn't be a problem
---
Poor comparison because there’s clearly much more value in someone using the gear than someone censoring it
---
Throw some RBG's over it with faction flags and this sub will be jerking itself so hard
---
Reality check here
---
Or even just random race and name, as if you were born and named by parents. 
---
Then you get to choose your class and professions

Classic 2004 wooden lectern replica setup, albeit some historical inaccuracies regarding the use of fairly modern technology. Forgiven by the dichotomy of the inexpensive linoleums dividing the floor. This vintage touch is endorsed by the way the light fails to be broken by the sparse drapery, producing a prevailing screen glare as a result. Congratulations.

This board would bug me if I had it, because I change my key binds and being kind of OCD it would rub me the wrong way to see a button say “action page 1” when in fact it’s bound to bottom left button 1.

Just a theoretical example, so calm down, Reddit police, no need to point out that there’s no such button on the board 😋

I agree druid has a very high skill cap, but that doesn't mean its not noob friendly. One of the biggest problems new players have is coming to grips with all of their skills and finding ways to physical access them at all times in an efficient manner. Druid forms make this problem far easier.
---
Second, in each role, druid is pretty straightforward. Swipe makes instance tanking easier, cat form has far fewer skills and cool downs to manage than a rogue, and healing form doesn't have as much extra utility to manage. To truly use a druid effectively one must work with all of their forms, but the natural separation of skills into roles gives new players an easy on boarding experience.
---
It's more for farming Maraudon where you sometimes run a shard deficit and it's tricky to get new ones in there.
---
Agreed but I’m just using one sentence to summarise someone’s 10s of hours of testing and work, check out the link, depends on your DL rank and dmg vs wand which is best, but the poster didn’t want to have to just wand so this is an alternative that at times is tested to be better than wanding

There is no Vanilla Druid tank data, because Druids didn't tanked in Vanilla. The data of Druid tanks from pservers is WRONG (14% parry for bosses in Classic vs 5.6% on pservers, 1/3rd less crit for players in Classic).The data from Classic doesn't exists yet.
---
So, what source you want?
---
Please provide ANY source that I am wrong, that is from OG Vanilla or Classic. NOT private servers, which is based on extremely WRONG data,
---
I remember when WoW came out and everyone playing everquest called it easymode for casual blizzard fanboys.
---
I recommend druid.  You can stealth wherever you want easily to experience any of the zones, amazing leveling potential, great class quests &amp; lore.  You won't get the Elwynn Forest experience, but Teldrasil is great too.  You'll also get to experience traveling from Teldrasil to Darkshore, taking the boat to Menethil Harbor before running the gauntlet to Ironforge (this is like a right of passage for Night Elves).

Tze Germanz!

How could this possibly matter in the slightest? You're insane.

I'm just gonna block you now.

I got in contact with a couple "vanilla friends" but none of them are coming back. I have 4-5 irl friends who used to play pretty seriously, but we all have kids and jobs now. We've agreed to play casually and see where it takes us.
---
We've now entered a time were typing "Don't like gnome" isn't enough, but "Don't like gnome to be quite honest" is too much

Ohh ok. Well that’s if the first person through broodlord waits on everyone else to catch up.

Legion started off horribly, everyone only remembers how good it was due to the last 1-2 patches. Selective amnesia.

MoP however? There’s our unsung hero.

Didn't you post that on shitty battlestations a couple of days ago on a vista desktop?

Best part is they're not physics, someone manually spent time animating every frame of that night elf jiggle

Just want to give you a bit of insight here. Pally's mostly just spam flash heal on the tank preemptively. They have a toolbox with some uses, and they have buffs which offer some utility, but if you're really looking for a more reactive and dynamic experience priests would be better, imo.

Depends if the tank is good. no wait time is required except for maybe 2 seconds if the tank knows what he's doing. :) (which mostly wasn't the case back then)

Wrath class design was just the best. It was masterpiece compared to the current garbage we have in BfA. Seriously, playing my DK in BfA makes me sick, especially when I remember how fun DK was in Wrath. And this applies to basically every spec I've tried in BfA.

You would.just have to use the random name on the chat creation screen. Scouts honor!

Yep, I do remember that. Pretty sure that was the Scourge event for WotLk. I destroyed mine like a an idiot. Those things sold for so much on the AH.

Hey bud, check out Project Ascension.  Lvl 60 cap, Vanilla zones/raids only, but with Wrath abilities and talents.  Really great mod.

Part of budgeting and living within your means is preparing yourself for the potential of things happening. Having insurance and an emergency fund covers this. However I am not saying that total disaster could not still strike and I am in no way saying we shouldn't have a social safety net to catch those that does happen to but that net should be a last resort and should never be treated as a hammock
---
Druids have virtually no downtime and multiple different play styles to keep you interested from 1-60 and beyond.  
---
Warriors have abilities that are activated after parries, dodges, blocks, etc which means you need to keep on your toes so you know when to use them.  
---
Rogues are constantly generating combo points which is engaging.
---
Horde &gt; Any day. Only women and men who think they are women play alliance. xD

Spoken like a true World of Warcrack addict.

Which keyboard had the screen with your character on it? I swear I’m not dreaming this!

Lmao
---
Ehh 1 button every 4 sec is an exaggeration (likely intended) but I still wouldn't say it's so simple, there's a lot to manage on a rogue 
---
So , you're right that you aren't pressing 20 buttons per gcd , but there are also other things to be managing on a rogue other than pure GCD management. Rogue requires a highly active brain to play well, you have to be thinking about many many different things at once to be a successful PvP rogue. I think it would be perfect for OP, but only OP really knows what will work best for him/her.

Disagree, legion started great with the sole exception of the legendary system, which was only really annoying if you were on the bleeding edge of progression and needed your BIS.
---
Legion was better than TBC, but thats my subjective opinion. Still think Wrath was better than legion though.

#NoChanges
---
Doesn’t really matter. Dots and stuff stack (up to 16) so locks don’t really care.
---
I’d recommend a healer for your group if you have any interest in playing a hybrid. enh shammy, feral Druid, shadow priest are all great combos with a lock since you can minimize downtime (you just rely on auto attacks/wand, save mana to heal your lock) and since you don’t plan on raiding nobody will give a fuck if you’re running 60 dungeons as a non optimal spec.
---
Otherwise yeah go for 2 locks, you’ll fight each other for gear but who cares
---
&gt; hard core players who will mostly be 60 by 3 months.
---
You mistyped 2-3 weeks.

I'd worry more about the constant puntings

A problem for twinks: you can't put head &amp; leg enchantments on twinks because the arcanum quests can't be done obviously, but you can still enchant the items via the trade window.
---
But it kind of did. I’m not necessarily saying that it was a bad xpack, I know I really enjoyed it, but that’s when we got our first real money pets and mount, LFG, tiered difficulties, catch up mechanisms that outdated previous content, achievements, hero class, etc. It was a lot of fun but it was the beginning of the end in a lot of ways imo.

I think I spent over 80% of my playtime in BC and WotLK in Arena, and I played for over 5k hours. In hindsight arena should have been its own thing on a separate realm where you get instant max levels and gear from vendors and balanced separately. Years of asking Blizzard to properly balance Arena when they also tried to balance PvE at the same time was a nightmare
---
I love this meme but MoP and Legion are both better than TBC 💁

Ah, I see.
---
For the druid, I actually wanted to make it a 39 twink (I like PvPing in the twink brackets). So I figured 35 to start, and then I could turn it into a 39 twink when I had the gold later.
---
I guess I imagined the flask thing being a once a month event whenever we're at the alchemy table in BWL. I didn't want to pepper them every time I wanted another FAP or health pot or something.
---
In the hypothetical scenario of just those four characters, do you think the hunter plan is halfway decent?
---
I'll definitely rethink the strategy with the mage. Blacksmith for max PvP sounds like a cool idea. I could always give the druid herb instead of tailoring, but knowing that I want to keep it at 39 means no mount, so gathering will be slower than with a 60.
---
You've been able to buy carries since wow was released you're delusional if you think wow tokens change that.
---
TBC needs quite a few removals.  Daily quests really got started in TBC, and were terrible.  The loot reset was completely unnecessary.  And they should have integrated it better with the old world somehow.  
---
Maybe gradually linking the two together better, with a more even progression, and removal of dailies would work.
---
Love it

Idiots in this sub couldn't get cutting edge even if they paid for all the boes they could get their hands on

That’s the  point I made!! We are soo much more experienced in the game and with all the guides and what not out now the little time we do put in will be 100% more efficient.saving and making gold will be easier! Leveling and knowing where to go and what zones are next are second hand now...it’s not really the time but the priority, most of my friends say they are busy but really they just want to go out and spend all the money their new jobs make them! Dinners and drinks/taking random girls out ( which it’s their life and my friends so I’m not mad) just feel like a lie lol
---
any luck on picking a main?
---
Only the people that have friends playing their accounts as well, or do you expect them to go at high efficiency for the entire week with less than 2h sleep each night? The only ones I could see doing this are Method members as they have multiple people behind each account
---
Yeah but sometimes an evil healer will try and keep you up...
---
Pretty much me. I have about 2 hrs a night to do whatever I want. I'm not wasting it on this shit stain of a game.

Simply “classic”
---
I mean, you can buy a fucking level boost. You can buy gold. Retail is 100% a pay to win game.
---
I'm honestly not even sure how raid progression goes. You can't get into the next raid before you complete the first one right? Or do you just simply need the gear to be able to do the next one?
---
Does Aux still take 5 years to scan the AH?
---
Yup. I'll agree with this.
---
I wouldn't say arena was an economical decision for e-sports. E-sports was barely a thing during burning crusade compared to today. Arena was developed as a way to promote skill instead time commitment for PvP.
---
Furthermore, WotLK was considered the best time for arena PvP and had exceptional balancing.
---
So they fixed it on the beta? Seems strange.. why fix that bug and not the others? Contradicts the no changes thing
---
Maybe 5 mans but if people cant be assed to show up for raid on time they deserve the humiliation of having to run and hold up the raid

The whole thing of having 3 talent trees that could be used for tanking was also nice. Frost tank in ICC was fun.
---
If wrath classic comes out I'll go priest in stead though.
---
A druid somewhere in there wouldn't hurt. Good heals and mobility, plus if your a rogue, 2 people with stealth that enemies dont know are there is an absolute blast. I think this is more so the fact when one of them can stun lock and cc and the other can heal

There was a private server that did just this before they progressed to TBC a few years ago and everyone quit besides like one guild of raid loggers since it's cross faction, turns out TBC with Wotlk talents just isn't as interesting as Vanilla with Wotlk talents and heavily tuned content. They were even able to add back in the Vanilla Naxxramas
---
"The Impale Prot Warriors gain 20% Damage for all their Critical Damage. "
---
Impale only affects your abilities, not your white hits.
---
"Fury Warrior meta : high crit = high damage output = high Threat. Losses 30% of it's pserver crit chance. Losses more than 30% of the damage. Losses 25-26% of its Threat (because for Fury, Threat is almost point per point of Damage Done)."
---
GOD THIS. THIS SHIT IS FUCKING WRONG.  
---
You pretend that a prot warrior gets all his threat from abilities, and a fury warrior gets all his threat from damage. 
---
This is bull shit. A fury prot warrior still casts revenge and sunder armor and heroic strike, just just like a fury prot warrior. They do exactly the same amount of threat as they do for the prot warrior. 
---
Where is your source that says how much damage affects a prot warrior's threat, and impale warrior's threat, and a fury warrior's threat? A prot warrior's threat, still has tons of threat coming from auto attack damage. A fury warrior threat, though he does more damage, is not " Threat is almost point per point of Damage Done". Every  point of damage is threat. But you still have defiance, which means that you get 1.45 threat per damage. So no, not point for point. You still get flat threat from spamming sunder/revenge/HS, just like a prot warrior. 
---
There is NO WAY, you lose 30% of your crit at 60 with buffs. So your whole example is just straight up wrong. 
---
Here is a parse of a fury prot warrior tanking. Sure you hate private server, but you are comparing to them when you make your claims, so here is a real comparision.
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=37263&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=59951
---
35% of his threat still comes from sunder armor. 28% from Heroic Strike, which does scale off crit, but also gives flat threat. So if a fury warrior even did lose 30% of his total crit (he doesn't), your assumption that he loses 25% TPS total is SO FUCKING WRONG. You would actually have to compute how much of his total threat he gets from crits, then recompute again with less crit factored in.  
---
However, impale prot is dead,  basically because 5 points in Cruelty is always more value than impale at low gear levels. It is likely that by the time you get enough crit to support impale,you are in solid fury prot territory.  In order to go impale spec, you have to sacrifice points in Cruelty and waste points in improve rend and deep wounds.  
---
Here is an excellent prot warrior tanking first MC for the server:
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=12148&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=19190
---
Revenge is only 7 % of his threat.  Heroic strike and his auto attack (or his damage) are far bigger components to his threat output.  So stop pretending that prot is only abilities, and fury is only damage. It is not like that at all. 
---
It is not a "quite clear" conclusion. Because you are still assuming a 30% threat loss for absolutely no reason. Because your math is fucking scuffed. 
---
Even if fury lost 25% of its threat, if it had double threat threat of a prot warrior, that would still be an acceptable loss. 
---
You are missing so much information to be able to form a "clear conclusion". You don't know how rage is calculated, you don't know how hard the bosses will hit, you don't know how much crit will be lost, you don't know how much threat from damage a fury prot actually does (you just assume 100% which is not even close to right), you don't know how much threat from damage an impale tank does, you don't know how much threat from damage a prot tank does (You assume near 0% which is blatantly wrong again). You don't know really anything. You are fucking just waving your hands and making demonstrably false claims. 
---
There are so many factors to consider that it is impossible to math it out here without more info. 
---
"We know that lvl 63 mobs in Classic will have 14% Parry vs 5.6% vs pservers, which is a death sentence for Fury Warriors, "
---
How is it a death sentence? It is like 10% more damage from the boss. Again, you quickly claim something in passing that is not true at all.
---
Priest because it tops hps meters
---
I'm thinking The War of the Ancient Trilogy. Of course there is no Time travel in Of Blood and Honor. What I'm saying is that the point where Rhonin, Krasus and Broxigar go back in time is between Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne. So it should logically be placed after Lord of the Clans and Of Blood and Honor.

I have to admit that I enjoyed the game back then more then I do now, wether it was due to the game actually being better or the experience back then was more exciting I don't know.
---
But I've been playing this game for 14 years with the same guild and the alot of the same guildies and they make the game for me, and that's why I do enjoy every expansion alot. Good content is important, but even slightly worse content can be alot of fun when you play with the people you enjoy playing with :)

You literally could do that in Vanilla.

Also how is that even pay to win? Congratulations you maybe got good gear and an achievement. No ones inviting you to a raid because it’s obvious you were a carry.
---
Hunter because I've never played this game and I like pets :)
---
Windfury totem gives an extra attack with 315 additional AP. 
---
Improved WF increases that by 30%, putting it to 409.5 AP, a 94.5 increase. 
---
Windfury procs on 20% of swings, which means your melees are roughly getting a 94.5/5=18.9 AP benefit from speccng into imp WF totem. It’s even lower than that when you consider that melees are mostly dual wielding and that only their MH will have WF on it, making imp WF worth less than the already small 18.9 it’s calculated to be worth. 
---
You also lose utility/efficiency talents like Healing Focus by putting points in the enh tree for better totems.

Current WoW is a whole other beast. Active Blizz wanted to appeal to a broader demographic but just alienated their core player base. They got the new subscribers they wanted and alot of them love the new game but almost all of their core player base left.
---
Legion and pandaria was best for me. Linch king, burnung crusade, classic are fucking joke. Its was good but people who saying its even bettet then bfa are those type who just playing with 4 buttons and still complaining how its hard.
---
Look at osrs. Way higher player base than rs3
---
Oof. I hope you brought plenty of water.
---
Yes. Some won’t, some will. I’m all for the option to tick on updated graphics on the client end, but I realize that would likely open up a whole host of technical issues so it will probably never happen. Personally, I’m fine with the old school graphics because imo graphics do not a game make. Classic wow is just fun.
---
yes, we asked for vanilla not a remaster
---
Trial of the Crusader dungeon introduced welfare epics, to easily gear your chars for current content.
---
So it did, badges of heroic and valor iirc.
---
Cant believe its been long enough to forget stuff like that lol
---
10/10 lolled irl
---
4 rogues and a druid. Stealth groups a fun. Open on a mage watch it melt stealth up. Repeat.
---
Why not both? Why not vanilla with updated textures? What's wrong with that?
---
It was good by the end. Lots of problems early on, though. Legendaries were horribly imbalanced RNG and playing multiple specs was a joke.
---
FUCK YES. You think I want to run around with all these new character animations that make them look clunky and like they have a shit in their pants?
---
Classic will be a nice middle ground between people that want no graphically changes (You can set video graphics to "Classic" settings) or you can use the newer client that has updated water graphics, environmental, and so on.
---
8,999,993 shitty posts until classic
---
The benefit wow has is that it does not aim for realism in it's graphics. This allows more longevity.
---
They may do am updated texture set at some point. I personally have no issue with that, as long as they don't change animations. I would probably use it.
---
Sure. 1 out of 9 chance to be a hunter, so I'm left with 8 good rolls.

My best wow friend from back then doesn't trust himself to not ruin his life with it so he's staying away. Another was a super-hardcore raider that cleared naxx, had Atiesh etc so he's not really interested in re-experiencing it.
---
Another friend is going to play with me after his wife and kids go to bed and before I go to bed- I have an early shift so we get 1-2 hours a night depending on factors. Luckily he isn't interested in power-leveling since he won't have enough time to do endgame stuff so we're just going to take our time with professions, questing in zones we never did etc. Looking forward to it.

Wrath was great until they added LFG.

theres a reason studios keep returning to decade/two decade old games. they are good and have a healthy fan base.

Plus, nu WoW is so dreadful atm that itll get people in just for something to do rather than play gear roulette hopping for a titanforged.

When they started to put the marks, that you only got  in naxx 25, in normal hero dungeons. That was with the Patch they put Trial of the Crusader in the game.

Dude i scheduled a trip to amsterdam from Brazil just to play the release with my brother in the same room while we eat space cake. My pitchforks are already ready.

I don't know, text based games were phone but we've moved on from them. I'm just trying to see this through the eyes of a larger player like my brother's and I think they have a solid point.

Legion is in my top 3 for expansions. I wasn't a huge fan of wrath, after playing nonstop in vanilla and BC I was burnt out so I took a backseat.
---
Legion was very fun, lots of things to do, the end game content was hard, it got me into mythic raiding, invasions were great, I enjoyed leveling alts, etc.
---
BFA sucked at first, but it's better now. It's still my 2nd least favorite expansion. WOD can fuck off.
---
On half of the fights you listed, you’d have to be standing in the fire/at the wrong place on purpose to take damage, and on some of the others, the amount of damage dealt is insignificant. 
---
Only Onyxia and Rag have relevant, consistent, unavoidable raid-wide damage.

does it really say "Menu de Jew" on the top left or are my eyes deceiving me
---
damn feels bad man, as somebody that missed everything from mid tbc until coming back in legion, game was still fantastic in my eyes and then bfa had to come and sully everything.
---
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass! The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass!
---
Level as fast as possible. Gear as fast as possible. If you're not doing end game content within the first 2-4 months, you'll probably never get a chance to do it.
---
I honestly don't see anyone opting for old graphics if you had the option to play the exact same game, with 0 issues, but with better aesthetics.
---
It's possible that the 1.12 itemization may have changed some things but I'm quite certain daggers is crap til AQ bc of weapon expertise
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Imagine being this guy
---
Ahhh... that undead warlock in the cinematic using hellfire, now that IS classic 😁
---
And roots!
---
PvE to PvP wasn't allowed.
---
The concern is less about being powerful and more about feeling good to play. DK felt fun in wrath and cata, and even MoP was ok. Since then they've gutted it and it just feels like crap.
---
You act like old animations are better than the new ones LOL. The graphic settings aren't the issue, I'm strictly talking textures such ad character textures.
---
Sure, but theres a reason you only bring 1 lock in premades, their utility can be done by 1 guy. You gain more situational abilities by having someone other than a lock.  Void sac does nothing if a melee is on you hard, you can only fear spam for so long
---
hey servus! Wir machen sogar ne kleine LAN und ja direkt um 0:00 (ausgeschlafen :P) Priests, Shamis und Warris können wir alles noch gut gebrauchen! mages &amp; WLs wird es langsam voll
---
Legion was the best modern WoW ever was. The class orders were amazing, they should've become a pernament element of the game.
---
"I don't care what it looks like but I care what it looks like"   
---
?????
---
People who play game for graphics wouldnt play BfA either. We are safe
---
&gt; TBC just needs flying removed.
---
And daily quests, and linear dungeons, and the (initial) need to play play pvp for weapons for PvE, and the slavish adherence to player as the only means of progression. TBC did a lot of things right, but if I were to do it again, I would not recreate it faithfully - I would implement quite a few changes.
---
Why would a Horde Warrior DW unless they end up with a Deathbringer, which will take awhile with how heavy on dps Warriors guilds are? You're trading 2% base healing for Imp WF and Imp SoE + Imp Agi.
---
Yeah because that's totally a fair comparison...
---
You're mistake better graphics with realism. I never said that. I'm more so thinking of modern wow textures compared to the old ones. Modern ones are clearly better aesthetically but without realism.
---
Zerging new ICC Heroics to get powerful items that outshine the early raid tiers completely. Oh and collect your Badges to fill the other spots, don't worry about experiencing the slightly dated content like Naxx - just get 4 braindead people and drool your way through some Heroics and before you know it you're equal or more geared than anyone who was playing since the XP release.
---
Would be like putting out a piss-easy Heroic Scholomance when Naxx came out in Vanilla, with gear better than MC-ZG-BWL and on par with AQ40. Many would laugh at the idea of "wasting time" in a raid when you could get equal or better gear from less time and less people interactions.
---
Why are you in the classicwow subreddit then lol?
---
I don't think your bro is the target audience...
---
I would. I still play with box 1999 models. 
---
Google "p99 character models EQ" and then compare to what they got now.
---
Just buy him a bunch of wow game time cards and then give it to him on your anniversary there’s no need to try to mess around with his account. He can just use the card you give to him and apply them to his own account
---
You're confusing gameplay mechanics with textures. People don't hate new wow because of how if looks nut because of how it plays. No one can deny how beautiful BFA is. However, we can deny it for the giant pile of gameplay shit that it is.
---
There are thousands of players who've held off on subscribing for a stress test. What they really needed to do was open it to everyone. There's no way the data they got from the last stress test is sufficient.
---
Food
---
Can you write it down for me? I hate youtube vids on my phone
---
&gt;I remember when WoW came out and everyone playing everquest called it easymode for casual blizzard fanboys.
---
because it was.
---
Not true at all. BFA is beautiful aesthetically speaking
---
Needs more passive aggressiveness in telling other people not to rush. Remember, other people playing how they want and rushing to 60 are playing the game super wrong.
---
I prefer the old textures personally. Hell people still play classic EQ.  The game isn’t about the veneer for these that look forward the the return of vanilla generally speaking.  Its about the experience, old textures and all.
---
Conjured mana cakes. Lots and lots of them
---
Searing Gorge/Burning Steppes
---
Being next to BRD, LBRS, UBRS, MC, and BWL is pretty convenient at level 60 too.
---
But I still think the Horde win
---
Agreed.  I actually enjoyed grabbing some DPS in Dalaran and doing the daily Heroic loop around Northrend.  
---
Some really fun times.
---
Are you unable to read my reply?
---
tbh i think vanilla/classic graphics is totaly fine. tbh i prefer such graphics then the ultra new graphhics other mmos use. i dont think wow will be good with such a new graphics as it is not suited for it.
---
and i think to say ppl wont play the game because of the graphics: look at fortnite millions of ppl play it despite having such an awful graphic. yes it something total different but i think it is awful but suits the game perfect
---
Yes in both.  Guilds bring 4-5 locks compared to 1-3 hunters.  Locks provide more utility in 5 mans and provide more dps.  If there is necessary cc a hunter cannot use multi shot which is 1/3rd of rotation.
---
Do you still play letter games too?
---
US open beta, I’m in eu so it was fun to finish troll starting zone as a mage with some Canadians and seeing the zenjin village and the sea for the first time. Back then, the water was sooooo impressive to me. I’ll always remember that moment.
---
Everyone I knew had cable internet, so this one almost feels made up to me.
---
It really depends on how fast you level. If you level in the first few weeks, I would do engineering after you hit 60. If you are going to be slower, it might be viable to do it while leveling. If you level fast, the market will still be plenty saturated with ore during the first few months.
---
eh maybe while leveling, kind of need to talk in certain levels of m+, but yeah but even for 10s which are what most people do at bare minimum you don't need to talk
---
It’s not vanilla
---
When I first played this game in 04 I was 17 with my whole life ahead of me and excitement for the future. Now I'm 32 working a boring job, old and tired, and the only thing I'm looking forward to is classic.
---
plastic wristrest?  truly a 200 IQ design.
---
You’d have to pay me to read WaPo liberal dribble
---
The old animations are clearly better than the new ones. The running animation on the NE's is fucking ridiculous. Taurens are squashed down to look like midgets. 
---
I'll give you the fact that the character textures do look dated in some regard but the masses wanted Classic. Not remastered. Not ClassicPlus. Not an updated Classic.
---
Looks like you and your brother are gonna have to accept it or risk being banned trying to overlay BFA character textures.
---
I found this little tool to do this for you. Just reroll if you get a race/class combo that doesn't exist in classic
---
I got Female undead destro warlock
---
😓
---
Transfers should be allowed on dying population servers.
---
But those players are gonna take 4+ months to reach max level so if you level up quickly you're gonna have a skewed community of elitists
---
Better, yes. I just think that gap isn't as big when you have non-realistic art styles. The less realism, the less you notice the age of the graphics. That's all I'm saying.
---
I think they might do a graphics update in a few years for Classic. Once they bug fix, it might be on the table. There is a LOT of work that would be needed for something like that though.
---
Your position is reductive.  If Edgemasters handguards dropped they would be of equal value to everyone in a group.  Same as Warden staff or any of the other high value BoE epics.
---
:D nunja Ts3 hat halt immernoch bessere Sound Qualität als Discord (wo ich dauer on bin). Ich bin kein Fanboy oder so.. ich (muss) Discord voice mit meinem UK OW Team immer nutzen. Das soll hier aber keine Grundsatzdiskussion über TS3 vs Discord oder welches tool dir gerade vorschwebt sein. 
---
Wir wollen zügig in 5er ini grps hoch lvln...
---
Alles was danach passiert kann und will ich nicht prognostizieren...
---
Wir haben fast alle schon classic geraidet. Der eine mehr der andere weniger erfolgreich... 
---
Ich persönlich werde mich eher auf PVP konzentrieren, was nicht heißt das ich nicht raidwillig und -tauglich wäre aber das Raiden hat irgendwann ein Ende, PvP hat nie ein Ende
---
The only one I feel like the sheet is missing is the computer specification posts. Despite the game being 15 years old and a mod literally putting together a pretty in depth post about system requirements, people still ask if their computer from 2018 can run it daily.
---
try and be  nice to people
---
Better pvp racials for Horde is a fact
---
Well then you shouldn't read the War of the Ancients at all as the part in the present happens after World of Warcraft Classic as confirmed by World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 3.
---
Naja, wenigstens haben sie von TS2 auf TS3 upgraded.
---
You mean to be accepted as a dps?  If it's a serious raid team they will accept maybe one for buffs if they're feeling nice.  The pool of priests that would love to dps will be large so you need to be lucky, amazing at your class, or have connections to make it far into raids.  Idk about paladins as I played horde, but anecdotally, our guild didn't accept a shadow priest until the debuff limit was raised to 16.  With classic starting at 16 it may be acceptable to bring 1 to each raid.
---
Yeah, i think mages only use wands as a statstick. Spriest at start rely on it complrtely, as a warlock you do have a choice in a way.
---
Yee same here.. they ruined retail piece by piece.
---
Literally any composition of organised people will have great success in WPVP.
---
Most people who find themselves in WPVP are solo or in a party with randoms. If they are with guild mates, they might not be on comms or expected PVP.
---
If you're on comms and there to PVP, the class combination doesn't matter too much.
---
That said it may be advisable to avoid using classes that share diminishing returns on CC's, and bringing a healer is always a plus.
---
Method doesn’t hold a candlestick to the amount of poopsocking the private server community is prepared to do.
---
Just because a few people would have issues figuring it out, doesn't mean other people will. Even if there is a small amount of people that dumb, there'll still be a slew more subscribers to stress test than there normally would be.
---
Besides all that, anyone explicitly resubbing at that point for Classic will know what they're doing, so your points are just moot.
---
The “bag of gold” argument is ridiculous. Comparing a 50s vendor green to a 1500g BoE is just extreme. The 50s will be earned by everyone in the next 10 minutes from mob drops and grays anyway, the 1500g saves someone 30 hours of farming later on. Not to mention the fact that the gold that the BoE is worth can be used to buy en equal item for another class, thus providing the same value in terms of gear.
---
Yes. Yes I do.
---
Except for a grenade stun followed up by CC's and focused damage.
---
i wish you good luck and a lot of fun with classic &lt;3
---
I don’t think graphics of the game will effect longevity at all. Most wow players don’t care about graphics we play a cartoony game and honestly the graphics of classic were kind of satisfying to look at
---
It's your opinion that it's more fun to play against bad players?
---
He gots to have dat ironfoe!
---
I’ll be the slow one in the pack. Probably 3 months or 5 to 60
---
80% of horde eill be undeath rogues it seems 🤣... in truth just start playing what you think youll enjoy most.
---
I played in a shit guild on a pserver. Would consistently take us 4 hours to clear MC because people were morons and kept dying. By the time AQ was out we didn't have enough raid days in the week to clear everything because clearing MC+BWL took us so long. This is why the speed run meta became established. Skilled players sick of dealing with idiots in their raid group slowing everything down.
---
I remember going into Tempest Keep with my supposedly organised guild. 1st set of trash wrecked us. Many months later the same group were looting Illidan, it made us up our game so much as a team.
---
Would have thought Forsaken is best for mage. Gnome is best for Alliance though, obviously.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
I don't think Blizzard care much about peoples holidays.  I think they care more about having a working game.
---
I JUST LIKE THE WAY BLOOD ELVES LOOK AND WISH WE HAD A BLOOD ELF OR HIGH ELF RACE IN VANILLA, REGAEDLESS OF FACTION
---
I HATE HOW OUTLAND MADE MOST OF AZEROTH IRRELEVANT AT MAX LEVEL, BUT REALLY LOVE ITS AESTHETIC COMPONENTS LIKE BLOOD ELVES, NAGRAND, AND THE SOUNDTRACK. EVERSONG WOODS MUSIC IS SOME OF THE BEST MUSIC IN WOW, DON'T @ME
---
Yes.
---
It blows my mind theres no marketing
---
and you think it’ll fail because...graphics?
---
yeah okay kevin whatever you say
---
I am impressed that you played with the same people for 14 years. You must have formed strong bonds. That is what it is about in the end!
---
I'm pretty sure they are silent because they are working on it hard.
---
Speak for yourself. I wouldn’t touch the game with a 10foot stick if it had retail (read: Disney) graphics and animations.
---
Probably overall, though I'd bet many would trade theirs for Escape Artist.
---
Trolls would trade theirs for anything :P
---
How can you rush a 14year old game?
---
Great content.
---
Hope this turns out to be viable. Would love to see footage of the gameplay.
---
Looks nice, but half the posts at r/wow are complaining about art assets clipping and problems with how their characters look. Better off just keeping the OG graphics
---
How will a shaman know whether or not the seal of command they are purging is rank 1?
---
still got 6 hrs to the month
---
&gt; those aren't bad graphics, they are specifically made aesthetics.
---
Same with WoW.
---
Timing it for when everyone will be subscribing to reserve names would get them a lot more data than the 2nd test. I find it extremely unlikely that they will cancel it like this other guy thinks. I think they put it off because 8.2 race to world first was pulling a decent amount of attention and they didn't want to step on its toes. I suspect we will hear something very early into August and we will have a stress test somewhere between the 5th and 10th of August. Followed by the name reservation on the 12th and then launch on the 26th.
---
They do want the game to fail
---
DW frost tank was my jam.  But so many people didn't have a clue... DW tank weapons for defensive stats was such a trap.  DKs needed high damage for threat.
---
If your time is limited, roll a warlock. They are the fastest class to level without being a huntard. 
---
Combined 6 dots plus fears you guys will be able to take on endless mobs. 
---
For dungeons, you guys get two soul stones, one for tank one for healer. Plus in pvp it will be hard to take you guys down. Doo ittt
---
Was Moonrunner a rp/pve server? Think I was there too.  Troll priest.
---
Luckily they did update the graphics. Classic looks way more modern than 2004 Vanilla.
---
Rogue: im basically a dick
---
I don’t think they realize how bad that would be for them.
---
Quick! Everyone wait really fast!
---
I'd been told it worked in the beta, is this definitely not the case?
---
Hurry up and wait!
---
Doesn't exist on EU clients unfortunately, but I suppose you could look up some fantasy name generator if you were to do it on EU realms.
---
WOOOOOOOO *does cartwheel*
---
Female; if I wanted to be a hunchback I'd roll undead.
---
So more office gifs with dogs in Goldshire?
---
Seal, Judgement, hammer of justice...  that's 3 buttons right there buddy.  Don't leave out blessings, heals, bubble, cleanse, lay on hands, divine intervention, consecration, etc...  But yea, only 2 buttons to press... smh while /facepalm listening to warriors talk like paladin is easy or boring.
---
People throw around lots of different ages but never provide any source so it gives the impression they just make them up.
---
When I was looking other sites showing statistics were quoting around 32 for males and 37 for females.
---
As a side note it's hilarious people talking about how milennials won't be interested in classic when it's a bracket that includes people born from 1981-1996 which accounts for a 15 year age band(which kinda makes it a bit of a glib statement to begin with).
---
If you need fancy graphics to be happy then that's you.
---
I'm good with old textures. Dam I grew up in the 90s when graphics went from 2D SNES to the 3D power of the PS2.
---
Pokemon red and blue on a black and white screen was my 8year old jam. Then came Zelda OoT and soulcaliber.
---
I don't need fancy graphics to be immersed and have fun.
---
I also thought not testing 40+ content seemed rather strange. Perhaps they think they can iron out a bunch of bugs before most players reach the higher-end content.
---
Screw that power level to 60 while all these scrubs explore zeroth and enjoy it.
---
I don’t know. I just really hope it does. I’m a really causal player and I use tab targeting instead of click targeting. And I don’t want to tab a million times looking for an enemy player over an enemy target.
---
Im pretty sure it was /me
---
You beat me to it 🙁
---
Theres 2 items from DM and gloves from mc that correct this.
---
I won't lie. Aesthetics are a large factor. Even the concept of being a underdog gameplay wise is appealing.
---
pretty sure if you are mounted it doesn't make a difference it's only while being unmounted.
---
You can also just move Magmadar. Damage is 100% avoidable, you shouldn’t be taking massive damage unless you’re sitting in the fire bombs, in which case you’re doing something wrong. 
---
Only Sulfuron is casting aoe spells (melee stun and fire spears), and the fire spears tend to hit ranged targets, not the melees. 
---
Baron only does “massive aoe fire damage” if you stay in his aoe from start to finish. The damage ramps up and the first few ticks are hilariously low while the later ticks are a few thousand. There’s no reason to be taking more than chip damage here.
---
I'd probably prefer it that way. I'd enjoy any class which makes it tough to pick one at try to focus on getting that to 60 without rerolling in the 30s/40s like I habitually did back in Vanilla.
---
I wanted to off myself after two 60 characters...
---
Void sac is a pretty decent sized shield and you can cast it twice with a long cooldown. 
---
But it’s beside the point, this isn’t a premade it’s a leveling duo and in that respect I still think 2 locks simple have more to offer. 
---
Huge pulls, low threat, self heals, self rez, oh crap buttons, mes, fear, and they can buff each other’s damage via curse. 
---
Warrior offers dps, aoe fear and hamstring. The last 2 are redundant with vw. 
---
Again, op should choose what he likes but there are certainly arguments in favor of either.
---
Yes but if you want to push Marshall/warlord + I believe the meta is heavy in destro and affliction. Could be wrong though
---
I’m gonna do this. Maybe it’ll help me decide??
---
the level of underestimating here is pretty astounding. I have a full time job and played constantly whenever I could and it took me three months to level a rogue last year.
---
With the mace from AQ20, it’s not the worst build in the world. I did it in vanilla and had one of the higher dps in my guild
---
Yeah, honestly what the Hell?
---
Some have come and gone but the core is still here. And yes we've become very good friends also went abroad to visit some of them. And they came over to visit us. It has given the game a whole new dimension.
---
They may have been on mobile, so they saw the image immediately, before they could realize it was a spoiler
---
37.89%
---
Not if my character starts out looking like one of the creepy kid models.
---
if you can only play a hour or so a day id just say do it at 60
---
I had horde alts and maybe I played them later and they changed things but what I remember as a big difference to me was not only easy of access to instances and much earlier you could access them. You could do an instance around 10 in a capital city. More over how much better the quest rewards were. You could get rare blue quality items sooner and easier. Not just gear but you would get quests that gave I think 8-10 slot bags. Plus the one that dropped in WC. After playing Alliance that was easy mode.
---
Laughs in druid
---
It’s wrong because it’s been simmed thousands of times and SF just dosnt compete.
---
You should. I only discovered tanking back in cata and it has been my favorite role ever since. I regretted not starting earlier.
---
*laughs in graduated all schooling eons ago*
---
Hell yes. Learning the other classes is interesting.
---
Story time. I came back for BFA after skipping legion. I've played every expansion for atleast a month, but I skipped legion because blizzard shut down nost and I refused to support them. After the classic announcement I decided to give retail a fair chance. The game I want is coming back, let's see what retail is about?
---
I made a fancy demon hunter. The starting scenario was fun, and the class played amazing. My perspective is probably skewed due to choosing literally the best designed class in the game at the moment so take this as you will. Leveling up was really enjoyable despite the lack of new abilities. I slowly took my time reading quest text like I do when I play vanilla on pservers and it was honestly a ton of fun leveling through the legion zones. When I got to Zandalar I had a blast leveling professions, and questing through the troll capital city. But this didn't last. 
---
I realized all the progress my character was making was literally useless and I was just hurting myself on weeklies by taking my time leveling. This was the first crack in the system. In vanilla/tbc there was no downside to stopping and smell the roses. So I stopped reading the quest text and started just powering through. Very quickly the game became a boring aoe grind fest. Just mindlessly following the quest tracker from objective to objective. It was no longer an adventure.
---
I got to max level and ran M+. Since I played at launch the only difficulty available was M0. My god what an easy faceroll. As someone who loved the cataclysm heroics, this was a slap in the face. I honestly can't tell you any of the bosses mechanics because they barely mattered. And this was on mythic. When the later difficulties got added I couldn't be bothered doing them bc I already saw all the content and the additional difficulty would just be adding stress onto the run. I did try tho, ran a few M10s with some irl friends. It was frustrating losing your key because some pug decided to leave 5 mins in. I really dislike the go go go speedrun mentality retail currently has. What happened to carefully planning your route through a dungeon using cc?
---
Outside of dungeons grinding world quests very quickly made me hate the game. When I finally outgeared them I was so thankful. I joined some pug normal uldir runs and it was alright. Very easy faceroll for gear that was way stronger than it should be. Managed to join a mythic raiding guild and got carried through heroic ghuun. I didn't read any of the raid journals and basically winged it the entire time but nobody noticed or called me out. I never tried mythic raiding because I knew it wouldn't make the content any more enjoyable. The fights just didn't seem like they would translate into a fun but challenging fight and seemed like more of a headache than it was worth. I really dislike how everything is based on addons now. Weakauras plays half the game for you and raiding just feels like spinning plates.
---
Without raiding or dungeons to run I was left with pvp. Warmode was a complete failure. I had maybe one good experience where I ran around an alliance zone just spawn camping noobs. This was cool but quickly my fun got ruined by a bunch of alliance phasing in from another server. I did some arenas but everyone wanted RIDICULOUS achievements and rating requirements and i couldn't be assed trying to carry bad players to get my own rating up.
---
Because of azerite and Personal loot, weekly loot chests, RNg ontop of RNG I couldn't even focus on my characters progress. This left me with nothing interesting to keep me playing and I unsubbed.
---
This experiment with BFA basically solidified what I already know from playing vanilla pservers. What makes wow great is the adventure and the journey. All these crazy systems and requirements blizz puts in at max level to try and keep people subscribed for longer is just hurting the game.
---
This guy is right, and people also pronounce karaoke wrong too. Annoys me.
---
Tanking dungeons before max level is fine in any spec. Basically just equip a shield and a 1h wep and its no problem. For max level is there a mix spec that lets you do everything? The short answer is technically yes, but you would be bad at each role. At the end of the day if you are not in a serious raiding/pvp guild it would not really matter though I would think.
---
Pretty much every sane person tanks 5 mans as fury/arms.
---
Prot brings nothing in pvp. The best you can do is maybe FC in WSG, but even that is done better by other classes/specs.
---
Maybe Activision have them the ok to develop classic with the condition they won't have an advertising budget.
---
Gnome Warrior is bis
---
Doest work on my phone
---
Have you seen the gnome running animation? It’s absolutely horrendous
---
Loot comes and goes but being a douche and making someone wait another 10 minutes to kill the same mob lasts forever, karma baby, karma!
---
Ikr, imagine thinking it actually matters how many people will play either.
---
Blocked for probably being an alt account.
---
Not at the end. Thorium widgets and dense powder is easily 30g.
---
I concur, although it’s sharding too, isn’t it different from layering ?
---
I expect it'll be roughly the same in a raid scenario but more warriors will be willing and used to tanking 5 mans as non prot specs.
---
You cant pre-order classic like with a new game or expansion and most of the people who will seriously play it already know about it, so spending lots on pre-launch marketing weeks ahead of release doesn't make a ton of sense
---
for a hunter though, is there anything good early on?
---
Nah
---
Haha I mean I ask to be introduced as one, that counts emiright?
---
I’m afraid there is increasing evidence to suggest that it does, in both humans and animals. Neuroscience and genetics research are in the process of proving that nature (read: evolutionary coding at a far, far deeper level than we previously imagined), plays a deep role in how we behave and the activities that we would call cultural. Nurture is not the only force guiding how we turn out. It has been proven in mice, for instance, that trauma can be passed down generations.

Most unique place in wow.
---
Cool Idea, will try it.
---
Yes, we're all coming back hard! I cant take the wait much longer!
---
What?
---
I keep logging in to wow every few days to make sure it's fully up to date.
---
My PC runs like a dog but I intend to upgrade in September.

Will resub mid August ready.

Can not wait.

A few months ago, I reached out to almost all of my RL wow-playing friends and invited them to a discord so we could coordinate playing together (about 10 of us), that led me to use online way back machines to find the names of my old guild members and an old Facebook group for a guild I ran, which led me to reach out to about 15 more people, whom I invited to the discord server. This then led me to fully decide to run a guild and began advertising on Reddit, and with a month to go we have over 40 folks ready to go and I'm getting super excited.
---
You can tank dungeons pretty easyily as arms or fury while leveling so don't bother going prot at all for leveling.
---
For raiding if you're an offtank early on you might be able to be arms spec, you won't be able to use MS in raids but you could still nightfall (I don't think nightfall will be in the game for awhile), although I've never seen anyone do this so it might not work well and you might be asked by your guild to adjust your spec.
---
Lots of us were dumb enough at that time and smartened up, but also most of us were too broke due to a 15USD monthly sub to buy anything... and I was in college too.
---
Didn't make them do anything, they aren't entitled to a tag.
---
Yes. I would prefer more decent population servers over a bunch of scarce population ones, with only a few healty.
---
FF7 is only getting a remaster because of the normies who didn't actually played the game hyped for a remaster on countless forums for years. You will see on Twitch how many of these sheeps will spawn once it releases. FF7 is one of, if not, the best game ever made and you don't need to fix something that isn't broken, just like Vanilla. Saying it won't be good for long term because of the graphics is straight up idiotic because the private server scene has been going on actively for years, same for the nostalgia argument.
---
idk why im getting downvoted lol, james allen brack literally said he doesnt want the game to succeed. Im not bashing the game thus why I browse this reddit Im playing classic as my main game and plan to forever lol. bunch of sad mofos in this reddit

Im coming back with a lot old friends and many new ones as well. Heck, I know more IRL friends playing this time than the release of 2005. But our gametime will be max 20 hours a week, because of families and work :)
---
Im super hyped though!
---
Some people use it as a replacement for real life, so there's that.
---
Shadow meld is super underrated for PvP!
---
It definitely got me way more pumped for classic. I know theres not much story in classic wow, but it will definitely be a lot more enjoyable knowing why Durotar and Orgrimmar are called that, why the horde  exists, who thrall is etc.
---
I've heard about it before. Good thing we know this decision doesn't work. To me, all the knowledge gathered over these 15 years will serve as a tool and a motivation for blizzard to make no mistakes, which is awesome.

off you go.

if there only a server with all players who made this thing
---
Yah fairly sure they fired most of the communications people.
---
0/21/30 is legit
---
Wow graphics were specifically stylized at the time and weren’t even close to cutting edge then. Read the book the “wow diary”
---
Yep, on mobile the image and title are both displayed. I’m mostly making a joke about it though if that wasn’t clear :)
---
I have to teach and work and complete research and write manuscripts and complete a fellowship in my respective specialty, you’ll be alright
---
Yes
---
Yeah tsu(つ) != "t-su" or "su"
---
It will always be a thing most people don't wanna tank but rather see big fat yellow numbers or shine in pvp.
---
Then you have the leveling it is the slowest class and most gear dependant you will constantly be needing to upgrade I'm guessing most will switch to another class before hitting 40.
---
So you hit 60 grats, but the guild you are in already have a Mt and ot (guild leader and officer prolly) so they ask you to respec (prolly remain) to dps.
---
Wich is fine cause you can still tank fine in dungeons.
---
But that's not what you want, you want to be at the front of a 40 man raid tanking.
---
So you go to another guild or start your own, all is good but being mt means you have to have a almost perfect attendance and when your not tanking your farming or ploughing dungeons to get others geared.
---
Burned out  tanks was a very common thing.
---
All this and prolly alot more will make sure there will always be a shortage of tanks.
---

---
19-22/23 was kinda standard for the guilds back on my server. 3 times a week
---
HOLY SHIT I REMEMBER THESE!! THERE WAS A MOUSE TOO!!
---
I suspect tanks will still be in short supply on classic because they are not casual friendly. I suspect we will see more hunters and warlocks then private servers though because of ease of lvling with them.
---
Why are we posting about things that are "nothing new"
---
Is it hard to look at the 100 previous threads addressing this?
---
I always had a love for Un'goro for some reason.
---
Pretty confident that is one of the QoL changes made.
---
If you play nonstop after work with proper sleeping you should ding 60 as your newborn is being squeezed out, a moment you two can share forever.
---
I can already picture the flood of posts, for every 3 rage posts there's one with "I'd rather wait for it to be good than get it while its broken" post, the comment sections just filled to the brim with salt.
---
On P server our first MC and Ony was cleared before our 2 hour flasks fell off. By week 3 I think our MC run was under 40minutes
---
No clue how to even start to find them.
---
Argent Dawn, like many, was monopolized by 1 guild. That created tension and the fastest way to corrupt a guild was to pick people from existing guilds to fill rolls. So we were slowly cannibalized as well as being split when Katrina hit and our MT and OT vanished.
---
I have 1 friend from the early days and he would rather take a poker to the eye than play again. The politics were the downside to sole server grouping, but the family aspect had to be solid, much so more than it became by LK, and that created a much better, unified, playing environment. Now people just flake, spend a buck, leave and go at it again. 
---
So, any Laughing Skull clan from Argen Dawn stumbles across this post, message me :) Especially thronk, Muhoobda, even the hunter who never spoke till he got drunk and HAD to be the only person raiding as Survival back then :)
---
Yes, though the one that worries me is the name. I’m not a fan of the auto generated ones and I enjoy getting creative with that
---
In an effort to provide you with an actual response; there are mechanics which we were unaware of until the classic beta went live. The two relevant discoveries being that, if your weapon skill is 11 or more lower than your target's defense skill(less than 305 vs raid boss), the first 1% of hit from gear/talents is ignored, and that there is additional crit suppression applied to the total amount of aura crit(% talents/gear/buffs) you have, currently believed to be 1.8%, beyond the normal crit reduction on mobs of a higher level. 
---
Given that this spreadsheet is two years old, these discoveries are not accounted for. For instance, changing weapon skill from 300 to 305 only causes a reduction in miss chance by 0.4%. Additionally, the spreadsheet does not even seem to account for the normal 3% crit reduction to mobs 3 levels higher than your own, only reducing crit rate by 0.6% when switching NPC level from 60 to level 63.

Depends on the guild, specs, gear and skill. MC can be done under 1h, (Up to 4h), Ony 20-30 min, BWL 1h 30 to never...

---
Yea that seems actually really smart from a business stand point. I’ll admit I left twitch on the wow race since the beta is done.
---
If you're talking about efficiency, just level to 60 as fast as possible ( can be done in 4 days /played for hunter if you plan&amp;practice) then you can just farm enough gold to easily level engineering at 60. I'm not sure if you will have enough gold for mount and engineering if you're going as fast as possible. 
---
If you're going for the enjoyment of the leveling experience, you could definitely level mining/engineering whilst leveling. You can get 300 engineering at level 35, along with gnomish engineering. This will allow you to get the net-o-matic, battle chicken, mind control cap, rocket helmet, deathray and grenades which will be a huge advantage during leveling on pvp servers.

Within 3-4 raids for an average guild (3-4h raids) and within the hour for top guilds. WoW Classic, not vanilla.

I was 12 years old, just hit level 30 and was running around Orgimmar when a random higher level warrior asked me something about the whirlwind weapon quest chain, I don't remember exactly what I told him but I definitely didn't have any idea what he was talking about, I stumbled my way through that game lol. Anyways he ends up running me through the entire quest chain and tells me to pick the whirlwind axe at the end. I was so happy but I didn't quite realize until I actually went into a bg, because that was when brackets where 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 51-60. At level 30 with a Whirlwind axe I was a total god, two shotting players was a regular thing...
---
That's how you get a boy hooked on MMORPG PvP lol I ended up solo grinding rank 11 and exalted all three bgs on that warrior since I could never get into raids being so young.
---

---
But players also hate BFA for the changes in aesthetic.
---
I sadly remember having to change race of my old main because the male troll running animation introduced in WoD(maybe?)  was just too silly for me.
---
Playing Legion specifically I started to miss open spaces. Frostfire Ridge and other areas throughout have still had some of that Badlands charm. In Legion there was not a single are athat didn't feel cluttered and crammed with "beauty".
---
Sometimes less is more and some players still think Vanilla looks better than BFA despite the polygon count. The aesthetic ideal, not just the graphic possibilities, have changed a lot, but I haven't changed that much.
---
Lol now I kinda want to see it delayed so I can witness the shitstorm of "adults" who will have their lives interrupted by a 15 year old video game.
---
It's not out for another month what the fuck do you want them to do, spend millions of TV commercials and roll out Times Square advertisements for a 15 year old videogame?
---
The marketing will kick in with the final stress testing, server announcements and name reservations.
---
I sure hope so! If even 30% more of the dps warriors are confident tanking, I think we'll all have an easier time getting dungeon groups going. I for one am throwing my hat in the ring. I hated waiting around for tanks, and I now know I was the problem lol
---
I used to play vanilla AB premades with a raid geared prof warrior that had a holy pally pocket healer. They’d rotate to defend points and were incredibly difficult to kill/cap flags against.
---
One thing to consider - there will be absolutely no gold on any server. Sales will be slow, and then people have to buy it. 
---
That will come from quests, and killing mobs. Dailies aren’t introduced yet in 1.12 - so acquiring gold initially will be slower. If you’re rushing to 60 - just want to set expectations :).
---
I did say that the spreadsheet is wrong because it contradicts gigabytes it recorded data that says the contrary.
---
It’s like being a flat earther at a science convention.
---
1hr + (memespecs x 0.16666~)hr
---
First clears for normal "ahead of the big pack pre-bis" guilds I'd say 2-3 hours for MC. Assuming little to no wipes. If you don't wipe 2h first clear is totally achievable.
---
After that more like two hours and approaching one when they start getting gear and use world buffs.
---
Ony depends a bit, if you do split runs early wipes can draw it out a bit, but I'd say early on about one hours, later 20-30 minutes.
---
Sorry but i disagree. People arnt playing this game for graphics. They are playing it for its superior game play compared to other mmos

Black desert online comes to mind if you want flash graphics

"Picking a race is tough."  Reminds me of an episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun where the aliens are trying to figure out what race they are.
---
I am going engineering but I'm going to wait until I hit 60 to level it. The competition for nodes at launch will be insane and it will be easier to farm ore on an epic mount a bit after release. I would suggest hitting 60 which is when gold or ore farming is the fastest.
---
Good plan
---
&gt;A job is a job. Stop discriminating.A job is a job. Stop discriminating.
---
Thanks for this. We shouldn't make this into a political debate but nowadays not many people give equal credit to jobs. All jobs are necessary and one way or another, we're all dependent on everyone else. We should treat every job position equally.
---
It depends on your raid group. Are you running consumables, are the 40 people competent. Are they always there?
---
Lots of variables. 
---
Initially, get ready for multiple days and a lot of wipes. It’ll be slow, but it will be awesome :)
---
I plan on buying ore to level it
---
Fuck i thought you meant 19-22 hours, not 7pm-10pm.

---
For one, he isn’t descriminating at all. That would require he does something like not allow someone with a part time job to join his guild due to their low tier employment status.
---
Two, yes there will always be people working fast food as 40 year old adults, and I’ll always know they’re just... obviously not smart or something? Because myself and a lot of people I grew up with came from some of the worst circumstances possible (in the United States) and have been quite successful. It’s hard to feel pity when you know it really is easily doable if you work hard (without any privilege).
---
Now this I agree with. I don’t see anyone pulling that time off solo.
---
However dungeon grinding gives more XP (elites give the correct 250% xp instead of 200% on private) and they are easier to kill. Beta dungeon farm groups with crazy comps (big mage aoe spell cleave etc) are easily outdoing record solo leveling times. Can it sustain all the way to 60? Who knows.
---
But I have a feeling we’ll see a lot of players under 3 days played at 60 utilizing these dungeon spam strats.
---
warrior for life. lotr is probably the biggest inspiration. theres nothing better to watch than a skilled blademaster charging in battle. + a huge fan of knights and crusaders.

No obviously nobody has done that. That's utter insanity

That is some 1984 shit right there

I want to be able to solo easily and use the same spec and gear for both raiding and dealing big dick damage in PvP.
---
So... Hunter or Warlock.
---
Bah
---
Hunter. Ill be in a pile of the largest class, trying to join raids, hating life, but aside from raiding..I can run like the wind,jump kite, FD....I had SO much fun kiting the anubis dude to open the AQ event. Kiting the giant dinos in ungoro...my bow quest. I love jump kiting :) So yah, Im not playing it to "get anywhere" Ive done it all. I did it all to the point that wow became a job. Itas all about fun this time \~!
---
Still no free space?! This is not a real bingo card
---
Exactly. Sounds like doing something with your life to me!
---
I don't think they're interested in marketing it at this stage. They're looking to see how much profit they can make with a bearbones project.
---
3 man dev team, minimum in-game support from Blizzard, single forum, etc - This isn't an arm of Blizzard that they're currently interested in putting any money towards.
---
If it proves its potential then we might start to see marketing for it, but currently Blizzard haven't done anything like this and I can see why they wouldn't spend anything on marketing.
---
Yup. If you choose human over gnome you will get more mana back from evocation, but its not that much and only works, at most, every cool down. So you will be trading a larger mana pool (gnome) for a small boost of mana every few minutes (human).
---
rogue/mage/paladeen/warrior/priest, warlock or hunter. i'd prefer priest(spec doesnt matter but PI is gachi for the mage burst) for more reliable dispells, mc and shields.

Can you imagine the disastrous public image Blizzard will have, if they postpone the launch a FIFTEEN year old game ?
---
I mean, even Bethesda, the laughing stock of the gaming community today will mock Blizzard for such a failure.
---
Worry not, Classic WoW will be launched 26/27th, even if there is no more stress test until launch.
---
It is better for Blizzard to have queues, server crashes, bugs at launch than postpone it.
---
Lots of us will be casual, but there's time for that and fun and life. My biggest challenge to myself after all these years is to READ THE QUESTS
---
It's a trade off - if you want them to heavily market the game, Activision is going to want some heavy rewards. I'd rather keep Classic pure and away from Activision's micro-trans hands.
---
In Vanilla, I don’t really remember many guilds clearing MC quicker than 3-4 hours. Even with great gear. It wasn’t uncommon for guilds to do 6+ hour raids and still not fully clear MC but spend hours on wiping. 
---
Nowadays though many private server guilds have “solved” MC and BWL and can clear each in about 2 hours with the right gear and world buffs. Who knows if they will be able to replicate that in Classic but hardcore guilds that know what they are doing are going to be much quicker than how Vanilla guilds were 
---
As always, it really just depends on your guild. Are people halfway afk? Are people tryharding? What are the specs like? 
---
Lastly, don’t underestimate the difficulty in organizing and cat herding 40 idiots. A person is smart, people are idiots.
---
I follow this sub, but i don't follow any WoW (Classic) news. As it is now, the launch seems to go by silently, but they would trigger my inner-addict more if I saw actual advertising.

Tsunami is originally Japanese word and tsu is how we spell their word for harbor

We had this raid in Molten Core and a friend of mine didn´t answer half way through (1 hour after start).                    
---
He called us the next day and told us, that he fell asleep and woke up after everybody had left the raid. For him he had closed his eyes shortly, but we raided for about 2 more hours with him standing ´afk´ somewhere.                
---
Everytime he gets sleepy these days we remind him of that night and laugh about it.

I'm with you on druids. I've never leveled another class more through most of the expansions. It's always my first max level and it's always what I spend the most time on. You'd think I'd get bored, especially that I mostly ever cat or heal, but nope.

Im sneaky and i only start fights i can win. I got love for my companions and im kind of a coward. I got longhair dont care. Im a shadowmelt hunter
---
- Raidframes are the ones from current retail. (squares looking kindof like GRID or other similar addons).
---
- I dont know about mouseover macros.
---
Personal choice really. I’m also going hunter but I’m going Herb+Eng late game with skinning early for first mount money. Imo engineering isn’t useful until 200++ like you said yourself so I will wait till 60, maybe even after epic mount.
---
On a pserver I leveled with mining and eng on my troll on a fresh server and I got mount at 42 and had engineering maxed the whole way. I also buy every skill yolo. It was nice to have it maxed but I didn’t use anything except the scopes until 55-60.
---
I was 11 when I first played in 04. At 25 now I’m so happy to experience classic with developed brain. I won’t be a noob anymore 😁
---
Leveling Engineering/Mining doesn’t cost anything really but training costs. You’ll also eventually be way overstocked of ore and be able to sell it. The issue is you won’t be selling all of your ore/stones so you miss out there. If you want to powerlevel it and buy ore on server launch that might become an issue but if you mine all the ore you see I think you’d be fine just leveling it up as you go. My mining actually fell behind engineering because some zones just don’t have higher ore types even if they are significantly higher level. You’ll find thorium in level 40ish zones then hit WPL at 53 and see only mithril and gold.
---
You can literally paste your two questions directly into google and get your answers. But retail and yes.
---
Yeah - they're called doctors.
---
I always do this, I want to have an epic mount and 1 or 2k spare gold for some comforts and the AH is the easiest way for me to achieve that.  (I have no patience for grinding cash mobs or farming dire maul)     
---
what I like about the AH play is that I can combine it with social behaviour, a bit of chatting and silly roleplay . My chief bank alt usually is also one of the server 'celebrities' because the character is online so much and meddles with everybody
---
I wonder if he’s paying this company/person he’s contracting to develop the addon. He made a lot of money during vanilla but I’m willing to bet there’s not much profit to be had here. Especially given it won’t even be available for launch when everyone’s leveling.
---
8/13
---
While i think you may be right its not because of the graphics. It will be because there is no change or new content. 
---
People really not gonna care about the graphics
---
Sorry but 10 years of private server success factually defeats your argument.
---
Double oof!
---
I love how half the basic abilities I keybind apparently default to emotes on this thing.
---
Maybe, as long as I could stay horde
---
It's not going to be cheap
---
Welp. I'm sorry you mispronounce "tsu". Considering the pronunciation of this word is determined by its origin.
---
😂
---
To take your own metaphor. Where would you be if you were not lucky enough to find a partner and you did get hit by one of those bullets?
---
I do web development as well but, i feel lucky and I don't feel that I have room to judge the less fortunate.
---
Fighting over gear is so frustrating. Was a witness of enh vs hunter rolls for a long time. Glad I was the odd man out in that.
---
But in raids...
---
Lmao, what a statement... 2-3 weeks to 60 is crazy fast and very few people will do this (1-2% at most). Most people will take several months (&gt;3) to get to 60 and even then, people at 60 will be a minority. Fast levelling has nothing to do with skill, although you could argue that time invested = skill, but that’s assuming everyone who has a lot of spare time is also a skilled player, which is a bit of a stretch. I’d dial down your expectations if I were you.
---
Whoops, bad example. Let’s say staff of Jordan XD
---
They have never delayed a release that they have announced the release date for.
---
They think they do, but they really don't.
---
We can't say any numbers right now, we only got some from private servers and we know they are different in many aspects from what Classic will be.
---
The crowd pummeler is a big deal for the spec, there is a chance Ironfoe, Flurry axe or The Jackhammer might be good enough that farming MCP won't be neccesery, we'll have to wait and see.
---
This is the weakest circlejerk complaint this sub has had (which is saying a lot.) Why would they market a 15 year old game that will not appeal to most modern gamers. The niche audience it hits is well aware of its existence. They got tons of free exposure on Twitch, which hits a much larger audience than the stream man bad crowd wants to acknowledge. In terms of revenue, this isn’t a major release for Activision Blizzard. They’re keeping costs low.
---
Yes, but that's the whole point with having silent letters. They change the pronunciation of a word and removes "breaks" between wovels and consonants.
---
The Chronicles are the definitive lore anthology written by a massive team headed by Chris Metzen that (so far) covers everything from the beginning of the universe up to Cataclysm. But you don't need them to know that the present part of the WotA trilogy happens after Vanilla and just before TBC because in them, they talk about TBC happenings including opening up the Caverns of Time to "adventurers".
---
Surprisingly some people cannot simply
---
Be born &gt; get raised by responsible parents &gt; graduate high school &gt; go to college and start making $50k/yr
---
While this might be your path it's rediculous to assume that everyone can do the same.
---
Step 1. Make macro with "/targetenemyplayer".  
---
Step 2. Place the macro on your action bar.  
---
Step 3. Bind the macro to TAB.  
---
Step 4. ???  
---
Step 5. PROFIT.

---
Seriously though, this shouldn't be necessary as I'm pretty confident that the keybind option which you described are still in Classic.
---
Nightfall is P3
---
If you just plan on doing pre-raid but still want to apply your 100% I suggest this build https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxi0dVZgcLzVxao You can wield a powerful 2h and go melee and hit the mob without consuming mana. Naturally, a few points here and there are dependant on your  gear but the jist of it is 0/20/31
---
Its not a fair point tho. Classic is being made for a specific audience who have been asking for a 15 year old game as it was 15 ywars ago. Blizzard is not making it for people who expect the newest graphics. Your brother and likeminded people are not the target audience. Those people will not make or break the game.
---
I think its more of "Hiyundai" not "day". The 'Da' and 'I' make it sound more like "Die"
---
I told my cousin about classic during a conversation and he kept talking as if I didn't say anything. We are now estranged.
---
I highly doubt they'll delay the game if they didn't even bother advertising for it. They're just going to launch it on the 27th whether its finished or not.
---
Everyone I’ve asked is coming back, with the exception of the person who got divorced from the person he played with during Vanilla.
---
There were plenty of HotW druids in vanilla. If you're horde getting a raid spot might be tougher. The pserver people like to bring 2 druids and stack resto shaman for massive chain healing, they might bring the moonglowers over you. 
---
The output between a moonglow/tranquil spirit and a hotw druid is becomes more noticeable once you are preraid bis + a couple raid drops or when the diremaul buffs come out. Before then, they'll only be healing slightly harder, which is mostly overheal, and their nature grace won't be proccing as much. You will be barely worse.
---
In beta dungeon xp was very high.  With how congested questing will be I think we'll see more tanks and healers than ever before.
---
Hmm that's a strange one. It is there, but currently set to phase 4 because it was added in patch 1.8. It looks like the other two items in the set were not part of a set until that patch. Where they're using 1.12 versions of items, but gating added items I'm not really sure where this one is going to land.
---
Go Dwarf or Gnome for pvp utility.  Gnome mage, Dwarf Paladin, Dwarf priest, and warrior/hunter/lock for 5th.

What's the reasoning for being anti achievement?

here is a website/tool that people are using to find old wow friends: https://www.vanillafriends.com/

[1. General] [Kippingthroughlife]: Did somebody say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker)?
---
Maintaining all core mechanics?? The combat system is 100% different. You are just saying a bunch of stuff you know nothing about friend.
---
Thanks, I'll add that to my todo list.
---
Some 5 man instances can take longer than some 40 man raids.
---
Yep, pretty much this for the vast majority of the player base.
---
No reason for AQ40 and Naxx to be on "how long raid last" list, because most players won't be able to clear BWL, hence, good thing that you didn't even mentioned them.
---
Maybe not specified release dates, but I remember patiently waiting for Diablo II after and thet initially had stated 1999, it came out in 2000.
---
Doubt that’s accurate mate, also 4 hours a day is pretty hardcore, only people who stream for a living play 12+ hours a day and even they would struggle, so you’re talking about 0.0000001% of the population who get these kind of numbers. Most people will average 1,5 hours a day and that’s including longer sessions in the weekends. For the sake of maths, let’s assume people will take 5 days /played (fairly efficient), that’s 80 days played with 1,5 hours per day, or 60 days at 2 hours per day. That’s several months right there, being a fairly efficient little shit too (so not too much ganking, mining, harvesting, fucking about, etc.)
---
Undead tho
---
It’s funny to me cause russian language allows to easy pronounce all those sounds, but you need to train a lot to correctly pronounce “th” sound and even then it turn out as “s” or “z”
---
I mistakenly said karaoke the American way to a quiet mannered Japanese woman and she let out a good laugh.
---
Imagine rolling a Undead Warrior.
---
Can you provide a link to a clip with the correct pronunciation?  They all sound identical, even some of the Japanese pronunciations I've found so far.
---
2-4 hours. Ony is 30 mins.
---
Hue hue hue
---
I don't doubt any of that. I'm just saying that this wasn't the state of the lore in 2006 and shouldn't be applied to WoW Classic which is WoW as it was in 2006.
---
Just read the chapters of the War of the Ancients trilogy and you will see that initially it was supposed to take place after Reign of Chaos. The Chronicles might have changed that as they changed so much other stuff.
---
As long as it took
---
Im pretty sure everyone who would want to play calssic already knows about classic. It wpuld be a waste of time and money
---
I didn't notice it.
---
You can bet the vast majority of addons that existed.. that are still viable.. will.
---
You mean the 0/30/21 spec?
---
Yeah when I first started playing we did one main MC run on Friday night and it was 4-5 hours to clear at a very casual pace. Start late, run a few people short, shoot the shit and take long breaks.
---
Eventually we started doing BWL for 2-3 nights a few hours a night and it almost immediately broke apart the group as the more casual players were not interested in doing that. I think we all learned pretty quickly who preferred long easy-going runs or shorter more structured ones.
---
By the end of vanilla it was common for weekend 3-4h MC pickup groups that you could get into with a decent reference or a lucky invite. These days guilds tend to form with the expectations already set, and nobody is going to be having a rough time in early raids with 1.12 and modern mechanical awareness. So 3 hour clears should be typical for most in MC at least.
---
you don't have to turn it on, you know.
---
You could raid all content with that schedule.
---
But you're a web developer working on computers all day, so I'm not surprised you could watch streams 6 hours a day.
---
Not everyone sits at a computer all day, there are other jobs out there ya know.
---
That sounds fine for an OT/DPS.
---
There's no problem, unless your healer tells you there is a problem
---
shhhhhh, we will get to level up before everyone finds out about the game
---
Sick dude, tell me how the party went!
---
Let's asssume a normal semi-competent raiding guild: MC 1-2 hours, Ony 0.5 to 1.5 hours, BWL 1.5 to 2.5 hours.
---
AQ40 and Naxx are a different story for different reasons.
---
I don't think there's much to market unfortunately. People who played classic and still follow the game already know about classic and are awaiting its arrival. All the other WoW players who came after have no nostalgia for classic and grew up playing a very different version of WoW. Those players will largely be turned off by the difficulty of classic.
---
Thank you for posting this, it's given me nostalgia of my own Night Elf male Warrior I made. His name was Searingbeast, and had a Warmonger that I bought off the Auction House, because I thought it looked cool.
---
I don't think it was worth the price I paid for lmao, but still gives me memories. Especially back then, my friends would congratulate me on getting such a cool looking and unique sword.
---
No, the whole rift in time the bronze dragonflight discovers doesn't happen until the TBC expansion...
---
No its not actually crazy good? Its like an extra frostbolt and super tiny crit increase.
---
Gnome is better for escapist. The int bonus is mostly irrelevant.
---
It does though that's the entire point of it. If there are too many people on a server, the server makes another layer so more people can fit. There are no new auction houses made. If layering is not made so that more people can be on the same server, then why is it even there?
---
If you're in starboard stance though prepare to get hit pretty hard
---
* What about a scientist at a flat earth convention?
---
* Or a pediatrician at an anti vaxxer meeting?
---
* What about somebody discovering the heliocentric view in a geocentric world?
---
Do you see how stupid your argument is?
---
Even if something has been said a million times and there is a shit load of data to support it, one correct model that contradicts it can change the whole theory.
---
now the only thing I can think of is Goofy saying "Hyuck"
---
Ka ra o ke
---
With world buffs SF becomes way more viable. So unless you join a guild who needs that crutch combat will win out for progression.
---
I'm going to get like 700 fps in classic where in the real thing I got like 10-30. 
---
That trade off is enough of a perk I don't care.
---
The day after they announced it, he had an interview where he said "I still think people will stop playing after they install and realize they now have to buy arrows and food and run to dungeons." Not that he wants it to fail, but he's deluded enough to think that it will.
---
Just bring along any support class and try not to have the majority of the group be meme specs, you'll be fine. The numbers are never even in WPvP anyway so you'll always either have the upper hand or be the underdogs.
---
He’s right about the first part. If it’s not a big preorder item, they’re not inclined to market it. Hence why league of legends, dota , and fort nite didn’t spend money on commercials when they blew up
---
Nah, you’re being downvoted for being a fucking douche, and literally saying everyone is wrong except you, because you don’t agree with anyone’s opinions except your own.
---
AV will be out in phase 3 together with WSG. It's AB that'll come in phase 4.
---
Curious how often you were able to get into organized PvP as a Druid. I fee beaten down seeing all the people say that they are useless other than WSG and I won’t be able to PvP heal at all. I just want to stealth around and heal people while saying BOO to hunter pets. Also curious as far as damage whether a priest or Druid could hold their own better in a BG 1v1.
---
Gimme dat karma
---
Sasuke can be pronounced both Sasuke and saske, it just depends on how fast you speak.
---
Without autism levels of buffing MC is done in sub 2hrs in full blues by half decent guilds.
---
You realize the point of a stress test is to push the servers to their limit, right?
---
I would, there isn't really any class I fervently dislike. Out of boredem I just used a random number generator to randomize my race/class and got dwarf paladin, not bad.
---
No marketing and no collectors edition (or merch).  They missed out on two easy ways of getting moolah
---
Xiv is the best current mmo out there. So much to do-
---
 Leveling is slow and adventure like. You can play cards. Raise chocobos for racing. Farm reputations. Crafting is complex and has rotations.  It's just a really well made and maintained game. 
---
I am so amped to play wow as an mmo again. Rather than a mobile bitesized gimmick with raiding.
---
That is *awesome*, thanks a lot. Really wanna use EP/GP for our lootsystem. Can you disable it for certain bosses/certain loot and just assign loot to people? I plan on running it for almost all loot distribution except MT loot, legendaries and stuff like Anathema/Rokdelar questitems
---
I just finished education(university) and don't have to get a job ever let alone anytime soon. You bet when this comes out imma have the dankest life in the world of warcraft.
---
Even if Classic does better, Retail will make more money and is ultimately the experience they want people to play. You have to remember that Retail still gets developed, it by definition IS the "superior product" because it has 15 years of development in it. Classic is only for a specific group of people, and we ***do not know what will happen after Naxxramas.*** If Classic does significantly better and they decide to push it... how? They can't ditch Retail for Classic, if they made new content they'd have to make 2004 quality graphics for it meaning their amazing art team would have to be pushed off into other projects or laid off. Not to mention all the other teams of people that they wouldn't need nearly as much of for mechanics that aren't nearly as technically challenging to create.
---
At the end of the day, they WANT Retail to be the main game, and thus they will continue to push it as so. I seriously doubt Classic will do better, I wish it does, I really really do, I just don't think that is realistic.
---
As My tauren arms warrior would say.. Yous a puss..
---
No he isnt wtf
---
Bit common knowledge....
---
I would say it's unplayable with default settings, didn't try the lowest possible settings. Windows would probably run it better than Linux, might be playable with lowest settings in windows.
---
I thought it was community management and publishing ?
---
I live in Ypsilanti and have ten or so friends in the general area who will be forming a guild on launch. Feel free to HMU on discord: Secret\_Fish#9978
---
Very buggy
---
Ascension wow's season 3 is going on rn with completely random spells and people are enjoying it, I guarantee there would be an audience.
---
 I do too. Plus with modern games, you can always patch in fixes.
---
Livestreamers? None probably, livestreaming a private server is a good way to get your stream taken down on Twitch
---
My coworkers were talking about how much they missed vinalla wow and when I asked if they were going to play classic wow they had no idea what I was talking about.
---
Compared to WoW it is dead.
---
One “correct” model. See the difference? You clearly don’t do I’m going to stop now. We can find proof to support anything we want to support. Finding that one outlier does not make it right, it makes it plausible at very LEAST. Plausibility is far different than probability, which in turn far different than fact.
---
Your asking the internet of all places to support quite possibly one of the hand full of places that state ST Daggers is marginally better than Combat Daggers, even though data miners and simmers have CONSISTENTLY and CONTINUE TO show proof to the contrary.
---
I get it btw. I played Seal Fate in Vanilla and did really well. When Classic was announced I started to do my homework to remember what the build was cause I wanted to run seal Fate Daggers again. I have since found COUNTLESS places where Combat Daggers is preferred over it and Combat Swords is the king.
---
There aren’t any sexy cool downs to combat Daggers and the PvP viability is atrocious. It’s just not an appealing build to play anywhere except dungeons and raiding.
---
Again I’ll state for the masses:
---
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY SEAL FATE DAGGERS PLAY IT. it is not so behind Combat Daggers that your team will notice it much. Play the game the way you want to play it. Just don’t cite one document as proof it’s viable over another and then get mad when people point out that there is literally thousands of places stating the opposite.
---
This is more than enough time
---
MC in under 1h? By then the last raid members aren’t even at the instance :O
---
But seriously, I assume 1h requires massive overgeared and the raid already being long on farm status. I mean 10 bosses in 60 minutes with that amount of trash in between?
---
Yep- I didnt include AQ40 or Naxx because if you're raiding them, you're going to be looking at 3-4 hours twice a week at least during progression. And if you have Naxx on farm and do it every week in 4 hours? Well, shit, you just beat the game.
---
That isnt outside of evil at all...
---
People have cleared it on 19 minutes on private servers
---
No, thats not the reason
---
There’s a reason BWL was a guild killer. You overestimate the skill of players or the underestimate some of the mechanics
---
As a little kid, I wanted to be a knight. The good and brave protector, not the black knight. As a teen in AD&amp;D campaigns, I often played some kind of knight-type - paladin, cavalier, something like this. 
---
Paladin was my natural choice when I first joined WoW, and my first toon got to around 40. I wanted to tank, play that protector role. Well, vanilla paladins weren't terribly great at that. So I ended up switching to warrior.
---
That'll remain my main. Can't wait to be back.
---
I push my mage feelings, way, way, way down.
---
Activision barely considers this a minor launch. It was mentioned for under 10 seconds on their earnings call. They are focused on WoW retail, destiny and COD
---
NOGGENFOGGER ELIXERS ARE GUNNA BE YOUR BEST FRIEND!
---
You should be fine - if you want to try it yourself you download the retail client (its free for everyone up to level 20) and lower the settings a lot to simulate classic. Its not exact but it will be pretty close.
---
Thanks for the reply. Fingers crossed!

Can't stream private servers bro

I failed 3 times thanks to WoW and became a NEET for life.

The launch day audable lol

The best I could track down around copyright on those assets is in their [legal faq](https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/about/legal-faq.html). I believe I fall under these guidelines, but obviously would comply if they reach out and say there's an issue with any of it.
---
Let's ride.
---
*KTERCH KTERCH KTERCH KTERCH*
---
I don’t see a issue just find a guild that runs weekends my man
---
It's basically just my travel laptop, it can do all the things you normally would do on a tablet but it also runs all your normal pc applications.
---
I'm going human and I'll probably be one of the most tryhard warlocks on my server. I just hate the POV of gnomes and how gear looks on them. 
---
5% int increase is next to nothing, they have tested the dps difference and its only like a 2-4 dps gain. The only thing you're really missing out on is escape artist. I leveled a gnome warlock to 35 on a pserver and I world pvp'd a lot, very rarely did I even use escape artist. I'm sure it comes into play more in max level pvp but still it's not a must have.
---
Once I get my human male decked out in that T2 set, I know for a fact I won't be regretting anything.
---
Resent it all you want, it's still true
---
Plenty. MC takes like an hour after the first few weeks
---
Not me: I was a quester questing quests through questzones on my quest. To be the best. At questing.
---
What did we do exactly?
---
There's nothing to pre order at all, doesn't mean you can't market it
---
I'm disappointing there's no space for "Youtube video narrated by man-boy with East European accent".
---
Only time will tell, but there must be some eternal tension inside the company between the two teams.
---
Yep. Very cool lil device.
---
Not a big priority for me, but I have been considering setting up a donation option of some kind. Costs are low right now, but it would be nice to not cover that out of pocket forever. I'm curious, would you be more into a one-off paypal button style donation, or something like Patreon?
---
You don't think guilds take classic seriously??
---
Legion sold over 3.3 million copies in the first 24 hours and that's not including any preorders. The launch didn't even require a server restart.
---
Nope, it's 31 days. Count again.
---
&gt; 1,729 
---
WAIT, FOR REAL THERE ARE THAT MANY MOUNTS???
---
u say that but as a noob healer desperate prayer was amazing
---
Yup
---
You dont have a name generator? Thats odd, any idea why?
---
I've been in 30min Ony where we died multiple times and 1 minute 13 seconds Ony where everyone had world buffs/consumes and they knew what they were doing.
---
It is but they share the same engine (classing using 8.0, without the multi-thread support that was added in 8.1.5 but still pretty close) so it should be close enough for you if you lower the settings. If you have active sub there most likely will be another stress test open for all subscribers.
---
The content in wow classic is before 60. There's no denying it. Everyone can tell you the leveling part is the most fun. Do a quick google search.  
---
The raids are super easy and dungeons are not meant for level 60. There's no BG for at least 6 months and when they release it's only 2. Its just another grind, no real skill needed.  
---
I'm not making this up.
---
Classic will be running on the legion client more or less.
---
I FULLY SUPPORT AND THINK THAT GOOD PLAYERS WILL SHUN THEM IMO, SINCE ILVL ISN'T A STRONG INDICATOR OF HOW GOOD IS A PERSON'S GEAR IN VANILLA.
---
Great video. One thing I always stress about skinning is that people will often do your work for you and you can get free leather as you run through the world. Imagine having a profession where people leave free money on the ground and you do absolutely no work to earn it, absolutely fantastic.
---
I’d still recommend taking LW with skinning as two gathering professions is a boring load out but regardless if you just want cash, it’s not a bad way to go!
---
And a vast majority of people can still be wrong. Take for example 'Forte'. Its pronounced 'FORT'. Yet everyone adds that extra 'AY' at the end. Just because people do it, doesn't make it right.   
---
On another side note: word Origins do not regularly change. \[But if you still have trouble here is a quick vid\] ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mA\_rcuyNns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mA_rcuyNns))
---
Shoot, sry. Deleting post now
---
How ? You don’t market every single product your company puts out. Most games that get marketing are big aaa releases or mobile titles
---
Start your own thread then. Are you new to reddit? I was responding to the original poster who asked for a mouse for healers.  
---
I don't care about you and your tiny hands.
---
Yeah, some did. Didn’t say it never happened. But the vast, vast, vast majority of guilds were not doing that.  Not even close. 
---
If your guild was geared and skilled enough to bulldoze MC, you rarely ever went back, if ever, once AQ dropped anyway.  Only reason to go back to MC was for alts and lottery legendaries.
---
Datamined info from few months ago confirmed that it is using 8.0 client now, which makes sense since they will need to upgrade its infrastructure since it needs to be current.
---
Dude, you really don't get it. I was ASKING if there is something wrong with the sheet and of course I want to know what is wrong with it. Anybody could come along and say "it is wrong", just like you did. That doesn't help anything. And I am not mad for an answer saying that it is wrong, if I am mad then only because you repeatedly behave like a dick.
---
And quite frankly, I don't care whether SF or combat is better, I just wanted to know what actually is better so I can play that.
---
&gt; We can find proof to support anything we want to support. Finding that one outlier does not make it right, it makes it plausible at very LEAST.
---
Exactly! But for some reason your conclusion to this is absolutely bullshit. IF the calculator would have been right, then any other proof to support the other fact would have to be reevaluated. This is how science works, you test something and see how it plays out. If something contradicts previous findings (no matter how many), you dig deeper and find out why. But you don't just say "it must be wrong because everything else says something else" ... this would be exactly like a flat earther: "From where I am standing and how I have perceived the world so far, the earth must be flat, so clearly your science is wrong."
---
STFU, IF THEY DO THAT ILL BE SCREWED OF 2 WEEKS VACATION TIME, THEY CANT DO THIS TO US!
---
Yeah. That's literally impossible in a fresh instance if you kill all bosses. Major Domo/Rag event alone takes almost that long.
---
Oh yeah for sure, as long as people actually loot the mobs they kill, you can get a lot of free leather! Ģreat point, I totally forgot about that 😅
---
Idk I mentioned that I'm stoked to play again and chill and have fun, but a lot of them make an excuse like they wouldn't have time to do anything even though they sometimes spend hours upon hours playing DotA or something else. We're all big boys now, you can say you just aren't interested it's not gonna hurt my feelings lol, fucking dopes.
---
Classic and Retail use the game client, the classic models are just less complex which is why it has lower requirements.
---
You can try the free version of retail and see how it runs with the minimum settings it will give you an indication of how it runs in classic, if it runs in retail it will also run in classic.
---
Def
---
In English it is pronounced Soo-na-me.
---
Maybe if you're pronouncing it in a different dialect like Japanese it would sound different.
---
Nahh... it wasnt that bad time wise. I remember we did MC, BWL Ony, Kazaak and world dragon in one sitting. 5h max. We had jokes about how we've run out of game content ;)
---
I recently came back too. I’m feeling the burn out. Besides dailies and grinding out rep and power there isn’t much to do. PvP doesn’t feel the same. Leveling alts helped for a little, but I find myself logging out pretty quickly. I need Classic.
---
When you spend years working on it, millions of dollars, and you only release a small amount of things each year, yes you absolutely market it.
---
This is a meme picture. No optical drives or floppy drives. For a case that old both were pretty standard. What’s he going to do with that parallel port cable? Hook up his dot matrix printer? Also the CRT that would be time appropriate would be bigger and heavier than all that crap combined.
---
Mage is probably the strongest class, but I have to play priest again, I just enjoy healing and mana burning paladins.  I am going to make myself some warrior’s personal healbot.
---
i agree with not wanting retail to be misrepresented. i think the general sentiment most people are echoing is that classic wow has a pretty solid difficulty throughout the entire game (1-60), but that difficulty is... well, less difficult than modern raids or mythic plus, but those are also limited to a small portion of modern. which one is better is honestly up to the individual, idk if that makes sense
---
If the majority of people who speak a language or dialect pronounce a word the same way, then that is how it's pronounced in their language or dialect. That's literally how language works.
---
And as an IT Tech with far too much time on my hands at work I never watch twitch because I dislike watching others play games, especially games I'm rearing to play myself. 
---
If we're comparing anectodes.
---
25hrs a week and you think you're too casual.
---
I’m just glad they don’t look like centaurs from Fallout 3. I always had to shoot those from far away and wouldn’t even loot them. Gross!
---
World of warcraft had specifically made aesthetics as well just like your excuse for minecraft. Compare eq2 graphics at release to WoW release graphics and they came out a few weeks apart.  
---
Graphics will definitely be a reason some people choose not to play, but at the same time if you updated the graphics you wouldn't capture those same people long term because they're going to jump to the next big thing as soon as it releases.
---
Parry
---
Dodge
---
Miss
---
No, but damn did I want one bad lol.
---
I had that case. It was a steel beast.
---
Carrying an extra 20 pounds of metal everywhere you go isn't THAT bad.
---
What does what I do have to do with anything?
---
You can watch a VOD of an 18 minute speedrun here. The raid splits into 2 separate 20 man groups. One group goes to Lucifron/Magmadar then to Rag, and the other group goes from Gehennas to Major Domo.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxdbQ2mgUfQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxdbQ2mgUfQ)
---
There's nothing to underestimate. Current wow retail players could do the "mechanics" eyes closed.
---
To me drinking is 90% guilt free. But I'm an alcoholic
---
no
---
You have to balance things nothing is healthy in excess.
---
I'm sure I've got a really old laptop that could play WoW until TBC came out.
---
No marketing for Classic WoW and STILL people think there's absolutely no chance of them postponing release due to lack of testing?
---
Maybe I'm just pessimistic but with the stress test being canceled and 40-60 content remaining untested a month before release .... I just don't see Aug 27th happening.
---
If you have bad adhd I was play rogue
---
It's also a repost from like 2 days ago.
---
Not true.  Most guilds went back for bindings.
---
33 days til release? Do you live 3 days in the past or something?
---
I did an auto-fill with only quest rewards for a level 60 Holy priest and it recommends Pristine Hide of the Beast which yes it's a quest it requires doing a raid and skinning the beast. tho I guess one can buy the hide on the AH?
---
Ya, I was a MT in a server first guild for Vanilla to Wrath and now I have a career/family/responibles.
---
Not only have I never watched or heard of Twitch until like 6 months ago, I didn't even know what Discord was until I started lurking this subreddit.
---
You know classic only goes to level 60 right
---
You are in your late 30s and retired, which implies that you did something with your life that was worth enough to create enough value to retire on... working 15 hours a week as someone who doesn’t need to work to support themselves is a whole lot different than working 15 hours a week as a grown adult while your parents meet your financial needs.
---
There's too few tanks to go around for dungeons since everybody needs a tank, but too many tanks relative to how many you need for raiding.
---
Most raids need about 3 tanks until Naxxramas, and then on 4H suddenly you need 9.
---
No, that's how mass stupidity works. That's like saying mass inequalities to education, illiterate rates, etc.. All factor into how a language should work, which is simply untrue (you don't balance from the bottom). A language has rules and structures, it doesn't care if you have a hard time pressing your tongue to the top of your mouth. So let's try it. Catsunami. There, you just pronounced it properly. Now all you need to do is drop the 'Ca'.
---
But at this point the thread is getting to big. I don't literally care enough for this but I am spiteful enough to get my last word before going away. YES language does change and assimilate a lot of crap. HOWEVER when we are able to do so we stick closer to the original pronunciation. ("tortilla" as an example)
---
Hey it goes both ways, pal.
---
I CANT DECIDE BETWEEN PRIEST AND ROGUE DAMMIT
---
No mention of TB?
---
Just research the meta a bit. Like don’t roll shaman if you wanna PvE dps in the endgame. Other than that the less you know the better
---
I got called casual for putting in 4 hours a day into ARK: Survival Evolved everyday. The Tribe Leader's friends came on from Rust and convinced him to start kicking people. I don't know how many but. . .
---
The other Alpha tribes must of caught wind because the main base was fully raided that weekend and the tribe disbanded afterwards.
---
I played the beta and had an absolute blast. Performance was great (40v40 PvP raids with no framerate drop whatsoever), the gameplay was great, I had zero complaints and cannot wait for the game to release. I wish the beta was still around.
---
This. I work in a courthouse and I know a few lawyers, clerks and one judge that are avid DnD players. So I casually mentioned I'm excited for Classic WoW, all of them responded with "What!? Classic WoW!? When!?"
---
Blizzard is really missing out on a lot of people.
---
This exact reason is why most people at the company I work at watch Twitch instead and don’t play anything—especially Classic.
---
thats a lottery legendary
---
I'm an altoholic. This does not phase me.
---
I did this back in the day too. I'd wake up around 5:30AM to go to school and hop on wow to check the AH. I noticed things were usually much cheaper in the morning, so I'd buy as much as I could and would put them back up for sale during peak hours.

I never tried to completely control the market for one item though. I was usually just looking for things that were below market price. Usually bought mats. One thing I noticed is that sometimes people would sell smaller stacks of mats at a price per unit much lower than what they sell for. Buy a bunch of those and put them back up as a stack of 20. Things like that. 
---
My biggest profit margins were actually from gear. I'd always just quickly browse through some gear and look for pre-raid BiS and twink gear that was cheap. With twink gear especially, you could occasionally find some pieces for super cheap. Some people would get a low level BoE and just throw it up on the AH without realizing how much it actually sells for. When I'd find that, I'd buy it and mark it way up. Sometimes took a while to sell and I'd have to post it on the AH again, but it would always sell eventually. 
---
I'll probably try to do it again. It was a fun way to kill some time.
---
I wasn't implying those are the only 2 options.
---
However:  
---
Enchanted Thorium Breastplate will not be in game in phase1, since it was added in patch 1.4 so phase2.  
---
Ornate Adamantium Breastplate requires you to not take Mark of Fordring which is pre raid BiS neck for fury and for threat in phase 1.  
---
Breastplate of Valor is indeed a nice balanced chest but it's one of 16 drops on Drakkisath loot table, and UBRS itself is probably at least a 10men raid at the beginning
---
Amen. I was so bad!!
---
1. The beta has been over for awhile
---
2. We are all well aware of when the game releases. We don’t need “JUST OEN MONTH AWAY!!!?1!11!?1!!” reminders.
---
1/29/21
---
Classicwow and Colts would be next to each other on the subreddit list.
---
I mean, I was in a really good guild in live vanilla (really the only time I've played this game at a hardcore level, something I doubt I'll be repeating) so perhaps my perception is skewed, but at any rate I'm not estimating anything. I believed at the time and still believe that anyone that *actually tries* can clear BWL.
---
The reason it was a guild killer was that it made it clear to the members of raids that *were* trying which members of their raids *weren't* trying. This became frustrating for the former, and they moved on.
---
That build doesn't compete with [the traditional Seal Fate Daggers spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/00532310505105-320305200001-05) which doesn't compete with [Combat Daggers](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005203104-3203052020550100201-05) until at least BWL gear.

lol @ 32 being "old and tired".
---
Like geez if you think you're old and tired at 32 you have no fucking idea bro.
---
Haha! typo :P
---
Most people are down.  I had a few that said, I already played that game.  Which I think they don't know what they are missing.
---
Don't worry, you'll still be a noob.
---
Frankly, yes. Point for point, dual wield spec is one of the most powerful talents a rogue can choose.
---
I thought as much, but then second-guessed myself thinking that maybe it was something I had never known before.
---
Essentially he had enough money to est the cost of cheaper silk to reupload on the ah. He never farmed the silk himself but bought it on ah and resold on tg he ah.
---
As you can see by the flair I'm planning to go rogue, but fuck me the urge to roll mage is hurting me. Mained a mage since TBC and I really wanna play it how it was not what it's like in retail now haha
---
No one said anything about a "rotation".  OP says paladins are too glowy and only have 2 buttons to press.  My point is to show the utility of paladins exceeds 2 buttons by quite a lot.
---
Actually part of me wouldn't be too upset with that.  I have 2 weeks paid leave booked for the august release.  So if it doesn't happen I'll just unbook that and roll it in to like a 5 week xmas holiday starting in late november? :P
---
Yeah undead still have nice racials but they really were carried by pure cool factor being honest.
---
AWW HOW CUTE. HE HELPED.
---
The “T” in Tsunami is only silent if you suck at pronouncing Japanese.
---
I'm going to be tanking exclusively on my Warrior and you already have like double my playtime each week with what you described.
---
You're FINE.
---
I’ve always wanted beastmaster to be a spec where you directly control your pet, and your character either follows (as a pet ai), or you in some way meld with your pet. From there you could tank or dps depending on pet type.
---
what the fuck
---
Everytime I try to play it, my cutscenes speeds up x10, so I have to watch them on YouTube.🙁
---
Seal Fate can absolutely compete with Combat once you reach the ~30% base critical strike chance. It can be as early as Phase 3 with World Buffs.
---
HAVING THE PATCH 1.11 PVP GEAR IN GAME FROM PHASE 2 IS GOING TO BE AN ENORMOUS BALANCE PROBLEM, BUT NOBODY SEEMS TO GIVE A SHIT. EVERY TIME I'VE TRIED TO BRING IT UP, ALL THE RESPONSES ARE FROM PEOPLE TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE TWO VERSIONS OF THE RANKED SETS IN VANILLA, AND THE ONE WE'RE GETTING WAS ADDED WITH THE LAUNCH OF FUCKING NAXXRAMAS.
---
Bingo, silk is literally spawning into the ground, that is the opposite of a monopoly. If you buyout all the silk and charge 1000g per stack people will weigh the time it takes to farm that much gold against the time it takes to farm 1 stack of silk, and obviously choose silk farming. All u/Locoleos really demonstrated was that by the time the AQ event was out people with their roughly accurate perceptions of value determined that it was more valuable to buy 20 silk for 1g than to farm the stack themselves. I agree when you can get gold farming methods of 50-80g per hour there is no reason to go out and try to farm 1000-1600 silk per hour, here's a hint you won't be able to get that much silk in that time. If anything silk didn't inflate properly and he was underselling to move the product quickly.
---
/Mic drop
---
It’s crazy just yesterday it was like 10 weeks until release and now only a month!
---
Yes but be careful because Role Playing hunters who only melee with a staff are their hard counter.
---
Honestly there’s a lot of memes about it but Horde Kalimdor is a pretty smooth leveling ride all things considered.
---
You can disable bosses, not sure about the rest. Both entries at wowinterface and curseforge have contact information for the author of the addon -maybe get in touch with him? Most love feedback and suggestions.
---
Hey man! I would not consider playing OT in Raids when you're mainly playing DPS with your schedule. But otherwise you'll be fine if you're playing at least with a bit effectively. The reason why I say this is the consumables and the time you'd have to put into farming gold/crafting them + getting appropriate Tank-Gear.
---
I do not know if it's impossible, but if you focus on the DPS part you will definitely have an easier time.
---
Yeah I think I saw something as well but it looked like the modern client with azurite weapons and crystal points and whatever dumb currency/point/chase the scoreboard system is in retail currently.
---
The best Warrior on Black Dragonflight US in Vanilla was an Undead Warrior.
---
Eating Alliance in PvP back up to full HP is pretty nice.
---
I like berserk as someone who’s plays trolls a lot? Sorry I don’t understand what your implying here.
---
No one people were so bad in classic. They were advertising keyboard turning and leaving 6 to 0 bound!!!!
---
You do tank the early dungeons as Fury+Prot Arms+Prot, but later it's a Prot build.
---
Too true!
---
So wrong. Watch any vanilla pvp video of a top player they're all throwing grenades
---
Hell yeah that would be the best way. How can we get a server like this???
---
What about ret paladins named "Warrior"?
---
&gt; But in burn phase of say Onyxia, what will a frost mage use? Frostbolt... what else?
---
Assuming they are the cookie cutter arcane spec most mages raid with early on, AP and PoM as well.
---
You don't have to go hardcore until ranks above 10. 10-12 is a grind and pretty nolife but it wont kill you. 13 is a step above that, and 14 you have to be top 5 honor in bracket 1 every time or don't even think about it.
---
Thinking of the same.
---
If you are alright with computers, try Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist
---
Enjoyment is different by taste.
---
Epic underrated comment
---
I still have GearGrip’s. They’re awesome.
---
Tclap has built in threat gen generation baked on the ability though, it's the highest threat 4 target move you can use.  Every ability has a built in amount of threat - whether it's split AOE on all threat list targets, or on each target it hits.  Then there's scaling based on "numbers", like healing vs damage.  So tclap doesn't do much damage, but has a huge initial baked on threat to overcome the bstance vs dstance, and then some.
---
Very good idea. I might look a bit into it, but I have 3 Classic Pros with me on launch so I don't need to worry.
---
Last 2 are reserved for ret paladin seals :3
---
Oh man, I'm so jelous of that. I will miss my old wow buddies  but i will look forwards to making new friends and guild.
---
I still use a carrying harness very similar to that (it may even be the same brand) to move my PC back and forth to college. It works like a charm.
---
No flame intended here, but why would they market to you? You clearly don’t have the time to game like you use to so naturally you won’t prioritize Classic as you once would’ve. The core audience that they would want to hit first will be looking for classic content and will already be in the know. This isn’t like OW or Hearthstone where they are gonna cast a wide net, looking for a new audience. For this, their demographic is known and accounted for. Especially with all of the server issues going on, trying to make a huge grab to inflate the player base temporarily makes no sense. It will grow naturally and if they have a hit on their hands, that’s when you’ll see mass marketing
---
Spell ret is not a PvP build at all, it's complete trash at PvP.
---
Definitely don't play an UD rogue. You will lose all sense of identity among the swarm of other UD rogues and your girl will leave you for some guy playing a troll because at least they're cute. How about you roll a traditional Horde race that respects honor, mud huts and not eating corpses instead of camping my ass in STV for forty minutes.
---
\- Sincerely, an Alliance Warlock.
---
I'd be okay with a server like this existing and would probably roll on it down the line, but no. I specifically want to play vanilla Hunters
---
We've yet to fully announce everyone that is involved with the new Warcraft Radio, but we also didn't want to use Totalbiscuits name so as not to come across as name-dropping for fame or relevance. We felt as though that wouldn't be the right thing to do for his legacy. However, we will be providing links to the archives that Genna has so generously supplied to the community for years.
---
This is absolutely incredible. Will you be doing the WoW idol contests again? I can still remember The Ganker, Strat Story and I'm Just A Druid among other classics.
---
Speaking of which, will you replay or rehost some of those song entries and winners? I think most are very hard to find now.
---
Really its gonna depend on your guild. 
---
Wether it's leaning more towards casual or hardcore and how many members it has
---
I forgot it stacks 5 times, we ran about 7 mages and 2 stayed frost. Seeing now it may have been more optimal to run 7 fire, ty!
---
That is true, but as a hunter (or mage in my case) gold farming is pretty easy. So which one is faster? Grinding out all the mats, or farming gold? I don't have the answer to that, but personally I would prefer to grind gold rather than mining.

28 minute MC pre AQ gear from a fresh instance with 2 meme specs.
---
You never understood any of this because you are like, "this is how I think about things, no one else thinks about it  differently". If you fail to understand how a class with long range, a plethora of cc, portals, free food and water, and high damage is more convenient than a warrior, then I legitimately don't know what to say.
---
I too played Alliance mistakenly. The Horde has since gained my love and trust. For the Horde!
---
I always say Is land.
---
You shouldn't be so quick to speak, aristocrat.
---
haha yeah not a big fan of that either, I've had a quick look for better pictures but I can't really find any better ones atm. If you have or know of a better image of Goldshire in classic anywhere let me know and I'll change it
---
It's not too late. If you want World Boss kills you must join the Horde!
---
Do you have a job? If so, you don't have enough time for warrior.
---
Why do you want this game to fail? 
---
You clearly have no interest in playing this game, yet want to destroy it so other people can't enjoy something they may really be looking forward to. You know what adding a token would do to this game, stop acting like a child.  And don't act like you actually care about Classic, your use of "pirated servers" instead of private servers gives you away instantly. 
---
You may be one of the worst kinds of people out there. I swear people like you were the ones raising their hands first and lining up to run concentration camps &amp; gulags in the 40's...
---
Impressive. I hadn't considered splitting the raid like that, but it makes sense when you are that geared with all world buffs.
---
I'm pretty sceptical about the aggro ranges on those trash mobs though. This time on contingent on skipping a LOT of trash that I don't know could actually be skipped in real vanilla.
---
You can't even begin to comprehend the power of the Light. You will be smitten.
---
They don't consider it a major release and I can't wait until it turns out to be their biggest release of all time. Probably an average of 9/10 gamers that I talk to are looking forward to classic WoW.
---
Warmongers
---
That is disturbing.
---
Don't tell me what to do
---
any bugs you'd like to share? It's not much more than a demo or concept at the mo, but if there's anything that stopped you using it at all you thought could be better let me know
---
Ahahhahahah

Very well, go forth and fret, worry, and wring your hands TO THE BONE, dear Redditor.
---
FeelsBadMan. Yeah ... They have all moved on.  Well, except me.
---
WOOHOOOOO!
---
There's something wrong with people that sign their reddit posts.
---
too long.
---
Probably casual as most of them stopped playing or play casual in retail
---
There is no way I'll be more than casual
---
I’m sorry I upset you :(
---
[https://youtu.be/lUH\_p8NHKG8](https://youtu.be/lUH_p8NHKG8)
---
I'd guess the opposite. If it takes you 30 days /played to get to 60, you are probably on a former twink character. That I'd an insane amount of time to reach 60
---
No upset friend
---
The problem is that it needs to be profitable enough for them to keep it going, if they don't make any money from it then it'll get shut down in a year or two
---
This guy death knights
---
AoE farm is great but you are going to ha r to be seriously ahead of the pack to AoE level.  Mob spawns will probably be competitive even with sharding.
---
Personally, I think I had more free time in school than I do as a fully employed professional.
---
Clearly not making enough money off of your career, seeing as you apparantly live under a rock.
---
I rock that combo, razer naga and razer nostromo (still got my 'belkin nostromo') as it was before razer picked them up.
---
Love this combo to death.
---
What crazy future did I port into?
---
People actually wishing for ads and promos?
---
Oh god, they were some dark times. Fond memories but dark times.
---
I think we’re gonna get some big news real soon. Just gotta be patient.
---
MAYBE BECAUSE NOBODY WILL BE ABLE TO REACH RANK 13/14 IN PHASE 2 BECAUSE ITS PROBABLY ONLY GONNA BE OUT FOR A FEW MONTHS, SO EVEN IF SOME PEOPLE GET RANK 13/14 IT WILL BE LIKE 5 PEOPLE PER SERVER, SO NO BIG DEAL IMO
---
&gt; if they don't make any money from it then it'll get shut down in a year or two
---
Blizzard have said that as long there is wow there will be Classic. So this is not a concern for us.
---
The only world buff timer that was wrong was ony/nef. That's only one. People will still get songflower/dm/zg buffs even if they miss ony buff.
---
All things in moderation. Including moderation.
---
Warrior is the hero class of Vanilla. By far the best tank and by far the best damage. Contrary to popular belief they don't scale and eventually become the best. They START as the best. Even in MC they are the best dps class, and the gap between them and the others only gets wider and wider as the warrior obtains better gear. Pretty much the only thing they're not the best at is 1v1 pvp, where I'd hand that to either mage or rogue with their cooldowns ready.
---
Thanks for the snide reply! You answered 0% of the question i asked!  
---
If you read what i said properly you'd realise i have figured out that i want to take alchemy and herbalism. I was asking if its viable to take skinning in place of alchemy and pick alchemy up at level 60 while keeping all my mats for it on a alts mail and use skinning as i level to make more gold...as ive never sent items to a alt in this way as storage i didnt know the limitations to how it works.
---
It's pretty obvious that Blizzard just considers Classic to be a perk of subscribing to retail WoW. If it's not profitable that's fine because the servers aren't going anywhere until WoW itself dies. It's not like server hosting is particularly expensive anyway, it's development costs that are the issue.
---
Pretty sure whoever refreshes it gets all the aggro from it though.
---
Thankyou, will give this a go!
---
Japanese way: Kah-rah-o-kay  
---
'Murican way: care-ee-oh-kee
---
Classic is a goodwill project for Blizzard. All the money they've poured into its development they're not going to get back. In the same way advertising would cost more than it would bring in.
---
Both are insanely strong classes. Someone who wants to play a well rounded class that's good in both pvp and pve would easily gravitate to either class.
---
All the guns and their ammo - the weapon is an item slot that has most influence on the leveling speed IMO. Having engineering while leveling allows you to keep your weapon up to date and keeps the costs for ammo really low
---
&gt;ONLY 425 MOUNTS
---
Oh man I feel old
---
Stress test is delayed because of the race to world first.
---
Too many nerds took time off work for launch for Blizzard to move the release date (myself included).
---
Had played warlock almost all of vanilla and some Druid in the expansions. Really want to roll warlock again,  but the rogue I never got to 60 still haunts me.
---
What are you, a bugged version of winrar?
---
It's not written Carry Oky But that's what most people tend to say
---
Not me.
---
15 years ago i was living on the other side of the planet.  A 14 hour time difference, and now different regional servers, would make playing together improbable if not impossible.
---
I will settle for making new friends this time around.
---
Mage aoe leveling will be massively worse than on private servers. No dynamic respawns, different mob AI and even mob abilities, different spell resistances and HP values.
---
The only disadvantage to being a gnome is that dumb clattering mount. Gonna be rep grinding on all my Gnomes.
---
TOO SOON!
---
I'm on the fence, I want to play, but if I play I'm gonna want to play like I did 14 years ago, and I can't. Id legitimately lose my wife, and I'm not losing that butt.
---
I almost upvoted you until I read the last part.
---
Do you know specifically which model of 2013 MacBook?
---
This is good. Me like it.
---
What you mean you don't want to live in your parents basement forever?????
---
He should probably do his starting zone(1-5)and then leave to go to the night elf area. Either way I wouldn't count on a gun upgrade or bow upgrade anyway until level 10 to be honest
---
My workplace required me to take my summer vacation in actual summer, in June/July, which are the two months people think of when they think of summer. Blizz releasing the game in what's basically September kind of majorly screwed with my plans to no life the game upon release. Oh well.
---
20s? Try 30s.
---
IT TAKES ABOUT 3 MONTHS TO GET R13 IF YOU'RE RANKING HARD. PEOPLE WILL HAVE THIS GEAR AROUND THE TIME BWL OPENS, AND THE GEAR IS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS T2.5 FROM AQ40. IT WILL NOT BE 5 PEOPLE PER SERVER, IT WILL BE AT LEAST TWO PER WEEK STARTING ~3 MONTHS AFTER PHASE 2 BEGINS, AND VERY LIKELY MORE THAN TWO. YOU ARE YET ANOTHER PERSON WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND AND STILL INSISTS THAT IT'S PERFECTLY FINE. LIKE I SAID, NOBODY SEEMS ABLE TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS PATCH 1.11 GEAR THAT BECOMES AVAILABLE DURING PHASE 2.
---
What is this, WoW for ants?!
---
And, fortunately, in battle grounds (especially in regular premades), me being able to solo someone is not a huge deeal.
---
I will say to detractors that I was in a really unique situation: I had the best PvE gear and I was on the best Alliance PvP team.  I was definitely in the smallest fraction of both PvE and PvP with that.
---
By that logic we should all be playing bless online
---
Yeah I actually see a lot of people that are not aware of classic releasing tbh.. while playing other mmos.
---
I mean, it is still a month away.
---
Yes it will be worse...but AoE grinding is so good that it will still be better than single target leveling. AoE farming doesn't need dynamic respawns to be efficient and many mob abilities have been already been checked on the beta
---
He means like feather fall, portal, conjure food and water. Quality of life stuff
---
They definitely still make them. I just bought one.
---
Yes and no. I'm not sure of the current state of affairs as I have not played WoW in a long time, but rampant price fixing and competition via botting was kind of a big thing when I quit. I'm not sure how much control they'll have over the situation when Classic launches, as this type of botting will really ramp up so long as there is still a means to do so with minimal risk of being caught. I don't think the "innocence" of old classic AH will persist quite like some folks are hoping.
---
Even when getting my moonkin ass stomped, I still loved it. It may not have been great in vanilla but it sure was fun
---
DON'T WATCH IT THEN
---
Yeah, hopefully not but I wouldn't be surprised. We're not teenagers or twenty-somethings with no responsibilities anymore. Full time jobs, kids, and irl commitments take priority now. My plan for now is to enjoy the ride to 60 and PvP mostly. I'd like to find a chill weekend-night raid raiding guild and hopefully get through BWL and AQ20 but we'll see. (:
---
Few of us get attached to druid, but for those who do ... there is no other way
---
I'm going Gnome Rogue solely for ganking.
---
From checking past [VODs](https://youtu.be/_9Lrqf0WjP4?t=5228) I did not see any rarity outlines in bags.
---
That is actually me.
---
Good call.
---
Okay well maybe you could work on reading what you reply to because in case you missed it the first time I said it, I’ll repeat it: I work with a significant number of high school dropouts and felons (that looks way worse on a job application than your speeding ticket and misdemeanor drug charge).
---
Here’s the kicker: almost none of them are white. Maybe 7 guys out of the 200+ at my job are white. So tell me... at my job where *no one* makes less than 50k a year... how all of these black guys, many of which have criminal records and no high school diploma, were able to get jobs when this “failing” system won’t allow black people with no college degree and a criminal record to get jobs that pay more than 50k a year?
---
Let me sum this up for you: My job has 200+ employees, of which 90% are minorities. Everyone makes 50k+. We have maybe 4 people with college degrees, and they’re all in management making 70k (which is actually less than some of the guys that constantly sign up for overtime). Everyone else is either a high school graduate or dropout, and a large portion have criminal records. Yet the system is rigged against all of those people. All those black guys with a less than high school education and a criminal record can’t possibly exist because the system only allows college educated, white people with squeaky clean backgrounds to make 50k+ a year. I’m sure all of my coworkers would appreciate you devaluing their efforts to build a good life for themselves if you said all of this shit to them. Lol jk, we all joke about people like you complaining about the issues that you think poor minorities face. Stay in your lane dude. Your lack of experience in dealing with poverty is making you look ignorant, and quite frankly a little bit racist.
---
You say in your video that people have said AoE farming is not possible- no one in the know is really saying that.
---
What they ARE saying is that it is far less reliable / efficient than it has been on private servers. I wont go into too much of the details- Joker made a video [going over almost all of the differences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky3V7LJunEw).
---
IMO, while some spots still do shine despite the changes due to how inherent amazing they are (tanaris pirates, I'm looking at you), given that your efficiency relies on being ahead of the pack, and the inherent inconsistencies of Classic Beta AoE farm- I don't even expect the top mages to be relying on solo AoE farm for amazing times like they have on private servers.
---
So they do. I couldn't find one for the longest time and I swear it wasn't on their website... But either way, that's good to know. I don't know if I could play without one now lol
---
Run the retail client with a browser window open minimized. This would likely feel more like what classic will be like for u
---
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE THO
---
then you can deal with your negative reputation in the community, lol
---
My belkin n52te STILL Works to this day. Some of the paint on the buttons is completely worn away but it still works
---
Can you link to your YouTube channel?  I’d like to like and subscribe.  😊
---
Idk if this would work because the name could be taken on the high pop realm
---
I already made a spreadsheet during downtime at work since I can't load general WoW sites here. My vanilla WoW key bindings have stuck with me and translated to what I bind in other games/MMOs. I basically recalled all my previous hunter bindings by heart so getting back into the groove shouldn't be too bad. I try to keep keybindings on what each button does similar across characters. Wildstar let me do that near perfectly due to the LAS, but with WoW I'll have to have more leeway on what goes where. I'm an altoholic, so it helps big time.  
---
My hands are small and I've been use to a limited action bar so I'll only bind 1-5, then the rest will be mouse buttons*(1-6 on the side for numpad keys, 2 on top, then scroll wheel left/right click)* and macro buttons on my keyboard for any extra.
---
* Q - Stun ability, but this was always Hunter's Mark when I played WoW. I recall making then Polymorph when I had a mage, always had it as a CC ability in Wildstar.
---
* W - Always a movement related ability that either moves/makes my character faster, grabs/pushes an enemy. Know this was AotC/Pack, Blink, Cheetah Form, Charge/Intercept, Death Grip for whatever I was playing years ago when I still played WoW.
---
* E - Either combo finisher, triggered ability, taunt, or more CC. 
---
* R, T - Long cooldown abilities
---
* Mouse 1, 2, scroll wheel left/right - Short cooldown abilities, mouse over buff/debut or pet management. Geared more to anything with mouseover being optimal for it.
---
* Z - trinket with shift modifier if needed depending on what trinkets I get
---
* X - potion, Wildstar trained my brain to mash x when I need healing so I'll stick with that
---
* \` - Always been my mount buttons even from the start of WoW  
---
Any buff that has a solo and party version I'll put in one macro. Downranked spells I'll shove on shift. I remember abusing the fuck out of ctrl/alt/shift macros when I had a shaman and bound the entire numpad for totems, forms, stances, and Pally buffs. Non-combat or flavor spells I'll try to group together by similarity and toss in a ctrl/alt/shift macro.  
---
I don't like clicking abilities....
---
Really? I used to take huge dumps on rogues as a lock back in the days
---
Dont worry, we all got fucked out of a "classic summer"
---
&gt;Does it matter how popular the game you play is, if it doesn’t have server/population issues?
---
I wonder if a game having low popularity could cause server/population issues...
---
IT'S ALSO ABOUT 0.5% CRIT CHANCE WHICH IS KINDA NEAT.
---
That is my mistake, I was not trying to misrepresent people, but my overall point was similar to yours. AoE grinding is not as good as on pservers but its still really good if you can get a good spot.
---
Did you just assume my gender?

Actual length of raid, whether raid is on farm or not, and guild management are the three major factors. To illustrate the third point, compare a guild that has a raid leader who says "be here at 0800 or that's a 50 DKP MINUS" to the guild that "starts" at 0800 and just kind of watches people trickle in for the next half hour and tolerates it. That's half an hour lost in MC before the first pack of fire giants are pulled.
---
I managed to convince a few. They were very surprised to hear Classic was even a thing. :)
---
I did lmao. He or she or them or whatever the phrases are
---
We are clearly the min/maxers of waiting... the ClassicWoW Redditors (and watching every YouTube video from our favorite content creators possible).
---
I get exactly 7 days of classic before class starts for me on Sept 3rd. I'm soo excited.   
---
Each of those 7 days will have 18 hours spent playing. All responsibilities will be on hold.
---
THEY'RE BOTH SOLID CHOICES, I GET WHY YOU HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING A CHOICE BETWEEN THEM.
---
yes that is the conundrum for tanks, you can get 5 mans all day and are super in-demand, but for actual raids suddenly you're one of the least in-demand and the spots in most guilds will already be filled
---
But does that affect your experience? If it's your friends that you want to play with, you can just tell them, no?
---
I DON'T WANT VANILLA+, I WANT THE ORIGINAL EXPERIENCE. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN SOME NEW SHIT THAT WASN'T PART OF THE GAME BACK THEN. THIS ENTIRE PROJECT IS LITERALLY ABOUT ONE THING: RECREATING OLD WOW. VANILLA+ HAS NO PLACE AND WOULD CHEAPEN THE EXPERIENCE. ALSO I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY PLAY TBC AGAIN ONCE VANILLA GETS DULL.
---
I played the ah game a lot starting in wrath. I would scan the ah for a couple things. 1 was greens and blues that were posted below what chanters would pay to d/e them. Just cod to them easy money. 2 was undercutters looking for a quick sale. And 3 was people that just made a mistizke on the listing like forgetting a zero. That happens a lot. I made a stupid amount of money just doing this for like 45mins a night during a play session.
---
Herbalism might slow down your leveling quite a bit.. Dependign on spawn rates. U could always skin until lvl 40 then start herbalism at 40 with ur mount and less players in the starter zones. Then swap at 60 to alch
---
Did you go to google and type in "classic wow addons"
---
That's quite the mantra!
---
It's a monthly sub, it doesn't matter if he plays 1 hour a week or 100
---
Hunter, Rogue, Druid as you can swap forms and regen mana while in form
---
TROLL IS THE BEST PVP CHOICE. HARDINESS SOUNDS GOOD, BUT BERSERKING IS OP.
---
YOUR POINT ABOUT THE GEAR BEING OP FOR ITS TIME IS TRUE, BUT I DO NOT THINK PEOPLE WILL BE GETTING IT. 
---
SIR THE HONOR PATCH IS BEING RELEASED IN PHASE 2 YES BUT BATTLEGROUNDS AREN’T BEING RELEASED UNTIL PHASE 3.
---
I HIGHLY DOUBT ANYONE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GRIND ENOUGH HONOR TO GET RANK 14.  I WOULD BE IMPRESSED IF A LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN GOT TO RANK 11. 
---
IT’S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO POWER FARM HONOR IN WORLD PVP GIVEN THERE ARE NO HONOR BONUSES LIKE WINNING BG’S GIVE AND HK’S HAVE HIGH DIMINISHING RETURNS. 
---
MOREOVER, WORLD PVP IS GENERALLY UNRELIABLE FOR THOSE WANTING TO GET CONSISTENT FIGHTS TO POWER FARM HONOR. PEOPLE RUN OR LOG OFF. IF YOU RAID TOWNS OR CAPITALS YOU RISK GETTING DK’S.
---
Oh yea forgot the weapon expertise!
---
This is true, and my understanding is that it is because of how their disputes with private server admins have played out in the European courts. The decision to do Classic appears to be driven at least in part by the fact that Blizzard doesn't want older versions of the game to fall under European abandonware laws.
---
It'll be the same as it always is probably like 10 to 20% of the whole server with the rest of the population stuck in the leveling process. And there will be spikes every 10 levels of where lots of characters stop playing i.e. 20 30 40 Etc
---
i'm going herbalism and mining until i get a epic mount. One of the few perks of being a druid
---
Obviously, maybe i should rephrase the question.
---
Whats the best place to download these? Or the most updated place? Or is there like a classic version of curse?
---
It's just about Blizzard making the most out of it.. trying to get the biggest playerbase they can get (more money) which makes sense.. Classic launch would just be played by people in the Blizzard community which would be a shame.. it's good to see completely new players.. I think it's very important and that also made classic so fun back then people that had no idea how everything worked and figuring it out.
---
Right, but the 1 hour a week player will not pay to play as long(not gameplay hours) generally. Building a game around the 1 hour a week player is what got us to retail
---
Yeah, young people don't know what's up with crippling dept. Anyhow, classic is gon' be great!
---

---
If you take 3-4 hours to clear Mc in 1.12 your guild sucks. Even a pug would be quicker. Even in blues you can clear it in two hours tops.
---
How do people make it through life without knowing how to google
---
Also pservers are not all the same, some could have higher armor/proccs and some have lower armor/higher proccs or lower/lower etc.  
---
Pservers =/= blizz servers is the only fact
---
There will be too few tanks for dungeons, too many for raids. Just like Vanilla. Tank role is usually the de facto babysitter for whipping groups into shape and that's not for everyone.
---
Football and classic wow? NICE
---
willitclassic.com curseforge.com
---
Yeah, Horde have easier access to Dungeons but I'm going to enjoy dragging my pocket tank all over Azeroth to do all the dungeons and tame all the pets I need along the way. c:
---
Getting people to subscribe is the point of advertising though. If they would subscribe how would it not be worth to market them?
---
We clear it on our private server in blue gear and one consumable in under 2 hours.  You don't need gear and works buffs for that time.
---
When was it announced, like 2 years ago?
---
FFXIV is actually doing the best right now
---
&gt;There’s a reason BWL was a guild killer. You overestimate the skill of players or underestimate some of the mechanics
---
You underestimate the power of high latency and low fps on Razorgore.
---
Any class that relies on a resource based on damage dealt is gonna be the best imho.
---
That’s actually a phenomenal idea. You can’t choose who and what you are, deal with the hand you’re dealt. Just like real life. Could be even more immersive honestly
---
I cant seem to get the command to pop up, keep spamming the down arrow. Could you add a command that shows a list of available commands.
---
Prepare the poopsock.
---
Did you miss the part where I talked about legendaries?
---
or on-est...
---
Don't forget to level an alt for that sweet rested xp.
---
If someone is in school than hunter is the best class by far.
---
Full 8/8 Tier 2 hunter with Chrom x-bow can take down tier 3 classes with ease. 
---
No way in hell I would aim for Tier 3 if I was in school.
---
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN'T GO DAGGERS WITHOUT THE GLOVES.
---
EMS been called yet?
---
NO SHIT JUST ROLL BOTH
---
The only class I might not want to play is Priest, I'm fine with all of the others. Not because the class is bad, but I've never really liked Priests aside from Shadow priest in wrath.
---
I think outside a very few selected fights the complexity of Vanilla raids is on par with LFR.
---
Classic marketing = 100,000 viewers on asmongolds stream + multiple asmongold reacts to classic hitting 1M+ views on youtube
---
What you're paying for is retail. Technically it's just another menu option.
---
AW MAN, THATS TRUE. GET EM' BOTH TO 60 AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
---
I played warrior all my life, for classic i decided to make a caster either lock or mage.Just to have a new experience.  I was set on one of those untill my gm asked to go dps warrior anyway. So, yeah its hardmode but most rewarding ofc. I will make a mage just for farming.
---
CALL ME A FILTHY CASUAL BUT WHEN I PLAY ROGUE I DONT BIND SINISTER STRIKE TO AN EASY TO REACH KEY. I CLICK IT TEN TIMES A SECOND TO HELP BALANCE OUT THE REPETITIVE STRESS BETWEEN BOTH HANDS
---
^^^/s
---
I kind of did that for my main back in 06. The first computer I played WoW on was so old it would regularly crash. So I'd keep re-rolling until I got my older brother's computer when he left for the Navy. Even the name was randomized.
---
Yes, in ackhtuality. Not treated as such.
---
WOW
---
HECK
---
If Engineering is your top priority, then yeah, I'd pair it with Mining. You should be able to get your Engineering up to a high enough level to use most of the cool stuff just from the ore you mine while you're on your way to 60. Also lets you save your cloth for bandages (and Warlocks really like bandages).
---
You can drop Mining for Tailoring @ 60.
---
What does that mean
---
Druid says I'm indecisive and noncommittal
---
Sorry, I don't know of any up-to-date spreadsheets. Your best bet is probably to ask around on the [Rogue Classic discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/mkfKCBB).
---
That's a 52 point talent build if I've ever seen one.
---
Remember that you can't track both mining nodes AND herbalism flowers at the same time in classic.
---
BECAUSE ONE OF THE DESIGNERS WAS FUROR PLANESWALKER, AKA ALEX AFRASIABI, WHO WAS THE BIGGEST CRYBABY IN EVERQUEST AND CONSTANTLY DEMANDED THAT WARRIORS GET ALL KINDS OF INSANELY BROKEN PRIVILEGES. WHEN BLIZZARD HIRED HIM FOR VANILLA WOW, HE LOBBIED DEVELOPERS TO MAKE HIS DARLING CLASS THE BEST IN THE GAME. THIS IS WHY IT'S THE ONLY CLASS FOR WHICH ALL THREE TALENT TREES ARE THE BEST IN THE GAME AT EACH THING THEY DO.
---
Apparently we’re standing in two sides of a fence and making the same argument. Have a good day.
---
Tasty disconnects
---
Lol which radar are you going to use
---
He will need to go back at level 10 to learn to tame pets too. Just a thought
---
Same here, It's been many years since I'm been this excited for a game to release. I started playing WoW when I was 13 and I'll be turning 25 in September. Classic releases almost a week before my birthday, so it'll be a early present for myself. I already bought a subscription card, just waiting until August 26th to activate it!
---
Technically it's not an expansion.
---
HONESTLY THEY PROBABLY WON'T. I THINK THEY KNOW HOW BAD THAT WOULD BE FOR PR.
---
SMASH that like button and dont forget to hit that bell too
---
Especially us guys in the southern hemisphere
---
Other thread replies posted as new threads confuse me.
---
Everyone... except the people who don't enjoy leveling and would rather be max level...
---
Thanks for telling everyone how to have fun, I'm sure they appreciate it (not)
---
How is that a fact? That’s anecdotal. The fact is that you heard about it without blizz having to spend a cent on marketing towards you. Your story is more evidence of my opinion than your own
---
Technically, they are far from their most powerful state throughout Wow's history, but I agree because of their play style. I enjoy them best in Classic because they are a true hybrid. Their best builds in pvp are hybrid.
---
Allowing each form to be competitive alone was the destruction of the Druid.
---
At 60 3 hours for raiding is fine. It's getting to 60 that will take a while.
---
It defeats the retarded logic of OP
---
YEAH I AGREE. FUCK THAT GUY.
---
Look at the parses from the best guilds on ND and tell me no locks use corruption. There are even shadow word pains up there.
---
KOS gnomes
---
It's because they won't be releasing the game in August. You heard it from me first. Also our streamer boiz will do all the marketing.
---
I can only be human, sad :c
---
Anyone know what to do with the guard?
---
I have tried Talk to, take the quest etc... but nothing
---
They market to demographics not individuals.
---
You're assumption that adults with families are not a demographic worth marketing towards is what I disagree with, considering that this is an age group of former Vanilla players and nothing indicates that they wouldn't pay for a subscription, even with limited available playing time.
---
True, reworded it
---
2% extra crit for one phase is hardly worth leveling an entire profession for.
---
RESTED XP IS TOO DAMN GOOD TO NOT HAVE TWO MAINS EARLY IN PHASE 1 UNLESS YOU ARE A POOPSOCKING NOLIFER THAT WILL EITHER EARN A WORLD FIRST RAG KILL OR COMMIT SEPPUKU
---
No. I dislike warrior and rogue. And I hate the visuals and animations of : dwarf, night elf, troll, tauron, orc.
---
Chances of rolling one of those is just too high.
---
I'm a bit speechless at this comment. I'm not sure how to even tackle that absurd logic.
---
Because I had no time for gaming + keeping up to date with the gaming community means I don't make a lot of money?
---
I make good money because I took a handful of years and focused on my career, family and side business instead of playing games, watching Twitch or browsing Reddit.
---
Now that I have a home and a good paying job, I've paid my dues and am ready to enjoy gaming again with all the funds I could ever need to afford what I need.
---
I feel like it's unheard of that some people took a break for paying attention to game releases/news for a few years to focus on real life.....yes I didn't know what Discord was, or Fortnite or *Insert any streamer name* instead I bought a house, a cottage, a boat and had a family.
---
All what you've said is correct except the first line. They, will make money from classic. Tons of people who don't play retail will play classic, which means that they get money that they currently aren't getting. Unless I'm not getting something from your post
---
It's a private server.
---
Hi, /u/Resistz

---
Someone just logged on their mage for the first time that day
---
I believe that Blizzard, at this point, already knows classic is gonna be a success. They just don't want launch to be too crowded, that's the main reason for not advertising.
---
Wait....so you're saying they aren't aiming Classic at people who grew up playing Vanilla? Where does it say I "clearly don't have the time to game like I used to"? Most people who played Vanilla don't have the time to game like they used to, in fact I'd say the VAST MAJORITY of those playing Classic don't have the time to play like they used to.
---
Ya, sorry, no flame intended here but nothing you just said makes any sense.
---
Not sure if I remember right but he used to spell reflect the shit out of casters and I think that was a prot talent before it was a base ability. Might be wrong though. Anyways, I’m vanilla it was fun to have him in our premades. Not sure it was optimal but having skilled players to fill slots mattered more sometimes.
---
Guild was second to kill rag on the server in vanilla(I think. horde got it first, guild only just started) we never had an MC over 3 hours. We ended up taking lock outs of other guilds to skip the shit bosses during later raid progressions.
---
 Onyxia took longer to run to than it took the guild to clear to her and kill her. BWL was always less than 2 hours when we ended progression(and server first) 
---
AQ40 was ages because we only ended up killing c'thun twice before the guild fell in so it was like progression the entire time.... and the run back before teleport was fucking horrid. 
---
Obviously with experience, the use of world buffs (we always had a head hand in buff), consumables, 15 years of mix-maxing, any organized guild will clear everything within the hour easy which should be no surprise to anyone.
---
you dont have to scatter to feign and frost trap
---
Blows my mind that MC can be done in under an hour. Doing it for transmog runs, where you can oneshot everything and ignore a lot of trash, it can easily take nearly half an hour!
---
I'm excited to hear y'all are back!
---
Walk south

Arrive at stone cairne lake or w/e and there's 5 murlocs.

Walk North from there and Ur at storm wind gates

YEAH SERIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE HERE ARE LEGIT MENTAL. I HONESTLY CANNOT STAND THE "HELP ME PICK A CLASS" THREADS THAT APPEAR EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHENEVER I TELL THOSE PEOPLE TO USE THE WEEKLY CLASS PICKING THREAD I GET DOWNVOTES. ITS REALLY ANNOYING. I UNDERSTAND THAT QUALITY CONTENT IS TOUGH RN BECAUSE THERE IS NO BLIZZ NEWS AND NO GAME TO PLAY BUT SERIOUSLY; PEOPLE SHOULD HONESTLY  FUCK OFF WITH THE CLASS PICKING QUESTIONS. LITERALLY JUST GO TO THE LIFE AT 60 THREADS AND DO SOME READING. JEEZ LOUISE
---
"You won't have every Lock using it" - you're saying the same thing that I am. 
---
Regarding SW:P - again, that's exactly what I said.
---
Now I don’t know how LFR in BFA is, but at least in legion RFA was still faceroll through the raid.
---
Already razorgore is not facerolling.
---

https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2vp216/comment/cojnxc5

Multiple tanks/groups, multiple players kiting mobs through the raid, and fairly easy full wipe.
---
Maybe I’m remembering it wrong though
---
Mmmmm okok now i can at least move xD ty
---
One thing about mage T3 is that the shoulders are actually not BiS for mages, but they are for warlocks and priests. So you will be last in line for T3 shoulders and first in line for the Gluth shoulders which look like level 58 greens.
---
My first class this semester literally starts the same day and time that Classic launches.
---
I already let my instructors know I have prior obligations that week and won't be in.  Not like its a big deal, its trade courses at my local CC, the first class each semester is literally worthless and spends more time getting the people who aren't actively working in the field oriented to what they'll be learning in the class.
---
I'm a third year industrial electrical apprentice, I'm not particularly worried about an advanced residential electrical course when Classic is being released the same night.
---
Why you have so many. A few may die, but that's a risk I'm willing to take.
---
Not at all. I don't even see where my comment would possibly imply that. I just am genuinely curious how one goes from a Warrior to a Mage as I have tried a few times to play caster and I genuinely disliked the playstyle so much.
---
I'm not saying "Mages suck Warrior good, me like Warrior and Mages are bad."
---
Hi willing to take., I'm dad.
---
Hi not saying "mages suck warrior good, me like warrior and mages are bad.", I'm dad.
---
Do you think this 37 year old guy in his mom’s basement is less fortunate, though? I mean he has a free place to live still. I had to find my own place as a teenager.
---
He sounds pretty privileged, honestly.
---
HA. GOOD ONE
---
Here's a way to understand it:
---
Prounce kiss
---
Prounce kits
---
The ending sound difference is the difference between tsu and su. The hard part for English speakers is that we find this consonant at the end of most of our words, where Asian languages use it widely throughout the language.
---
I dont think the T is silent
---
2 swords from SM quests you can get at like 36ish I have mine till I was into my 50s Vanqishers Blade and Serenity Blade or something
---
Think ill be taking skining then and just transfering everything over, thanks for your reply!
---
DUDE, NICE CHOICE.
---
You can get maximum rep with any race. The only way to get maximum into is to be a gnome.
---
THAT RULE ONLY APPLIES IN 5 MANS
---
You're saying even using corruption is a waste. It's actually the highest dps spell in the game even without NF. Its dps is so high you only need about half its duration to be worth casting.
---
It takes into account buffs does it not?
---
I’m honestly not planning to go super hardcore. I’m going to complete entire zones at a time and read every quest text. I’m in it for the long haul. I really enjoy the feeling of progress. Knowing there won’t be an expansion to worry about, I have all the time in the world.
---
Thats not a bad idea i might do that then. To be fair im not going to be speed leveling so dont mind going out of my way to get a few herbs but i do like the idea of just getting the 40 mount then swapping. thanks for your reply
---
Yeah I feel like you'd basically have to be ignoring the internet completely to have played vanilla and not known that classic is coming out by now.
---
Nope, we'll actually got at least a partial classic summer in 2019. All of December is summer.
---
They do a whooole lot more damage than a paladin, but their survivability is a lot worse, even though it's still way above average. (Basically they're the second highest armor class, just behind plate + shield).
---
how can we be 30 days from release when there are 31 days in july
---
A really simple way to catch the difference is to pronounce those words:
---
Kiss
---
Kits
---
The difference between those two is the difference between tsunami and sunami. English speakers just struggle when there is a vowel after ts.
---
See that little (t) there? That means you can say the t and it is still correct.
---
Yeah wait til he gets to 33. That's when it really starts to kick in.
---
Balance is brutal in pvp tbh. Hits so damn hard.
---
Yeah will do that then, it works out to roughly 757 mats needed to get to 300 which is around the 40 bag slot mark. might have to leave some in mail transit at the lower levels but will for sure be storing it at a bank alt. Do you know what storage you start for a bank with a new character? havent played in years!
---
My parents were drug addicts who went to prison. I ate out of dumpsters. I didn’t even go to school for years during the elementary school age bracket. I lived in a broken down bus with no power. I had to pay my own way, entirely, from my teenage years on with zero parental or familial or any other help. My first job paid minimum wage. I worked hard and now I’m way out of that shit.
---
If anything, it’d make sense for me to be a drug addict or have been in jail/prison etc, but I’m not... because I made smart choices. I don’t come off sounding privileged, I come off sounding the same as many people like me - those who were given nothing and still made it, and yet hear people complaining who have everything we dreamed of as kids. Like a free place to live when you’re 37, and a family that still exists or cares about you.
---
Nobody cares about maximum int except extreme min-maxers
---
Same here for school
---
HEY BRO I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS. THAT LOW EFFORT SHIT CAN EAT MY ASS.
---
Yeah! Classic already made be fail out once, can't happen again!
---
&gt; You're in your enemies back ranks disrupting their casters and healers, causing them to focus attention on you
---
How? With what skills?
---
You have Shield Bash, Concussive Blow (45 sec CD), Intercept Stun (30 sec CD) and AoE Fear on 3 min CD.
---
You might be able annoy 2 warlocks for a couple of seconds, assuming you can even get close to them.
---
&gt; causing them to focus attention on you, even if for a second to CC you
---
You have no extra defenses again caster other than a slightly bigger HP pool. They'll blow you up before you can get anywhere near them, just like any other melee. And even if you do manage to get in range, you're just going to tickle them a bit. Whereas an actual MS warrior can 1-2 shot a clothie.
---
&gt; You're protecting your healers and casters and peeling for them. You're assisting your melee by applying slows and CC to help them secure targets.
---
Same things can be done by MS warrior while also being able to destroy people instead of "annoying" them. 
---
And you don't lose that much suitability either, because as a warrior your survivabilty is your healer and the best way to protect your healer is to kill whoever is attacking them, which you're not able to do as prot.
---
It is a waste for a brand new Warlock who hasn't been raiding with the same group for months/years. It's not practical advice to tell someone to use it on a forum like this. 
---
A new Warlock will do more damage if he focuses on Shadow Bolt spam and then learns to pick his spots with Corruption, rather than trying to keep up Corruption in a new environment with potentially questionable debuff management.
---
I think they're missing out on a massive opportunity to get young gamers in. Most of us were young when we started, a lot of kids don't have any MMORPG experience. It would be a great way to grab them.
---
I love that song!
---
Actually no, the true hybrid class is shaman. 
---
You can do great melee damage (windfury procs) , while also relying on spell damage (shocks), and regardless what spec you go, ele or enh, you still benefit greatly from using both melee and spell. The talent trees are even designed with this in mind.
---
Even gear wise, you can heal and be a spell caster while holding a shield and heavy armor. That is like a permanent moonkin buff without the restrictions of casting healing spells. And not to mention, you got both RANGE, and MELEE. Regardless of what situation you find yourself in. The true hybrid class, folks.
---
I am also planning on taking some personal time. I’m telling my professors beforehand and trying to get ahead of the work. Thinking maybe take off Th-Fri and have a long weekend to get it out of my system.
---
 There are boars to slay and mnt dews to drink!!!!
---
Typically you want to set aside 3-4 hours for raid night. This isn't for the min maxers and speed runners, but for what a typical guild might ask for.
---
Spell reflect was added in TBC
---
Not everyone.  No wife here (but a long-time gf who doesn't give a flying fuck about WoW), no kids, my own house, and a dead end work-from-home job that pays well.
---
I will also play this game and enjoy every second of it!  The old crew is getting back together, but they do have wives and 2-3 kids each.  Man, that must suck!
---
I sure as hell will be. If I'm not level 30 after 7 days of launch I'll be upset.
---
Amazing to hear this. What you guys did back then was very special. People forget or aren't aware of how difficult it was to have online radio back then.
---
Started playing when i was 9, i'm 22 in september. Can't wait to play the shit out of this game and experience real late game.
---
That actually sounds pretty fun!
---
Im still between priest and druid and every damn hour I switch between the two. Or if I read a guide. Im so confused now
---
They're behind the dedicated DPS, yeah. I'm not sure what you expect, like of course they are. They bring stuff that a dedicated DPS doesn't in exchange for damage. Obviously if you replace every rogue with a feral, you'll lose damage. And there's very a critical mass (generally between 0 and 2, most guilds opt for 1 that flexes between tanking and DPS) of ferals per raid before their utlity becomes *really* redundant.
---
Where pure DPS especially shines is that there's no such thing as having too much DPS. But there's definitely such a thing as having too little utility. You have 40 people, so there's a lot of wiggle room to tailor your comp.
---
&gt;No I never understood it because both classes have their own conveniences.
---
We are talking about overall convenience, obviously every class has their own convenience. This proves nothing. 
---
&gt;I find Warriors just as convenient as a Mage. Just in different aspects.
---
Cool, remember the whole "everyone else must think like me" thing? 
---
&gt;But thanks for not only assuming how I think but the assumption you made is basically just what you're saying about Mages....
---
You've literally provided no reasoning for anything you've said, you've just reworded "I think otherwise" ad nauseam.
---
IF YOU DONT RUIN YOUR MOUSE LIKING THIS VIDEO YOU DIDNT LIKE IT HARD ENOUGH
---
YEAH I TOTALLY AGREE BUT BASED ON THE STRESS TEST I PLAYED THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF PEOPLE KICKIN IT IN DUROTAR.
---
You should probably stop tabbing out to reddit if its taking you half an hour to clear MC at level 120.
---
24 slots
---
Druids are far better FCs, even a rogue with sprint up would be a better FC.
---
Your "longevity" only matters if people have a reason to attack you, which they don't.
---
People are seriously over estimating just how tanky prot warriors are in pvp.
---
Extra 1-2k hp and being able to block melee attacks doesn't do much against casters.
---
You do if you are already in combat with other enemies.
---
You chose points in setup over blade flurry?
---
Oh what the hell ill comment here too.
---
Fuck yeah !
---
The memories of listening to total biscut and the spanish inquisition at 1am while leveling alts in the barrens lives on !
---
I will see you in classic.
---
I understand it.  I'm looking for an audio clip of it.  But I suppose it's more of a pedantic thing than something you can actually clearly hear?  I certainly have heard no pronunciation remotely close to the "ts" sound at the end of kits when someone says "tsunami" -- but maybe the pronunciations online are incorrect.
---
Look up a YouTube video on how to climb the hill by gnomer, into the mountains and jump down into wetlands, then rez at Menethil Harbor. So much faster then running to Loch Modan and running all the way through wetlands.
---
I understand why they do what they do BUT those old school Mr.T and William Shatner commercials are so epic lol
---
It's more then worth it for any raiding warlock.  Bloodvine is a must for the hit, no reason to miss out on the crit.  At that point you should have alts for professions.
---
One of the better "my battlestation" posts hehe
---
Yeah, it's all good. I was just sharing my experience. It's also possible there were regional differences for this. I.e. you might have different roll culture on German servers compared to US or Spanish servers.
---
Because most/many people who are doing this are leeching off of someone else, likely their parents, in order to make it work.
---
I'd love to hear how you retired in your 30s, especially if it involved working 15 hrs/week and playing video games the rest of the time.
---
Skran.. no significance it was just randomly created on my first WoW toon but it has stuck.
---
Tsunami bothers me, but I'm currently learning French and half the damn language is silent
---
My farming alt might be a feral druid, and luckily for them you can DPS and tank with the same spec. 
---
Warriors CAN do that as well, but to a far lesser degree IIRC.
---
There are some far more informative replies in this thread already, so I'll just state my opinion: there will be more tanks, but not more prot-specced tanks. People are likely to try new ways of tanking this time through (not everyone,) so us healers will need to remember the good ones who aren't insane. :D
---
Not gonna lie: If you're fine with the other options then yes.
---
This is what I planned also^^
---
That's because most people in the us pronounce tsunami incorrectly.
---
The proper pronounciaton is the same as kits. Most English speakers  pronounce it like kiss which is incorrect.
---
Since when do you need to be a tailor to wear Bloodvine?
---
Last private server I played on I had the 3 main pieces and didn't need to be a tailor to wear them.
---
No he can do the hunter quest in teldrassil I’m pretty sure
---
Feral was straight broken damage wise lol
---
Maybe just a guild:)
---
&gt;yep, I don't think OP has any idea what he's talking about. or they're a troll.
---
I think he's undead
---
I'm suspicious about the possible time advantage vs questing / grinding. What do you have e.g. any estimates?
---
yea it was a lot of either it was a good enhancement shaman that 3 shot you, or the paladin was likely to get them to 5% / force an anhk in wPvP.  
---
I did play Holy paladin and knowing my dps was going to be trash either way just doubled up SoL/JoL to make most shamans question if it was worth fighting me for 3+ minutes.
---
You’ll be all good man. I have the same MacBook Pro and have played wow (med graphics with like 40-60 FPS) league of legends etc
---
Jesus Christ what is this post
---
it didn't work in the last build of beta. I've been told it was unintentional though, so they might revert that.
---
Blizzard and TOOL both need to get their acts together and give us some informational! With releases in August we need to know more at this juncture.

Tell me why you want marketing. I don‘t get it

Mages are great alts for gold making...just saying
---
If you just want to dick around and have fun learning the game as you go, don't worry about it. If you're more interested in being good and getting to 60 for endgame content, I'd read a guide because there's a lot of good info to know ahead of time. One thing you should do for sure, save the meat you loot off beasts you kill. At level 10 you'll do your class quest to unlock your pet, and you'll need to constantly feed your pet until it's loyalty raises up...otherwise he's gonna straight up run away. That's not a joke.
---
I think it does
---
Ah yes. Suppose making potions is pretty decent too.
---
Wenn ist das Nunstück git und Slotermeyer? Ja! Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!
---
Yes, BWL is pretty easy with a decent guild. The hard part is getting that roster to 40-45 decent players. People have friends and crews they want to raid with and usually you will have a few fuck ups. The guild is still somewhat casual so they get carried and you pray they get better and they usually get slightly better but not enough to keep BWL from being a challenge.
---
And that’s the game we know and love.
---
My guild was at one point clearing MC in less than an hour and BWL in 60-90 minutes.
---
Enhancement is awful in 1.12 though. After all the Windfury nerfs.
---
6 hour ZG sweet mother of holy moly... are you still seeing a therapist? 
---
I’m guessing the tank had zero idea what was going on and let those trash smashers melt the raid over and over. Kinda funny but at 6 hours.... YIKES
---
Yeah 5 man's will be tough if you're not friends with a tank.  I loved pally tanking in tbc forward, but won't be doing it in classic as its just two slow and the lack of ranged pull and taunt just won't make it fun but tedious.  I'm not really interested in warrior tanking.
---
Doing heroic speed runs, and 3 man speed heroics once geared in tbc with my pally was the most fun I had in wow.
---
mages dps was worlds higher than warrior by the end of vanilla though?
---
People were also horrible at wow raiding back then. I gaurentee if blizzard doesnt tune this correctly thesexraids will be obliterated
---
So hamstring kiting is still the preferred way to level a warrior?
---
YOU THINK ITS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GRIND FOR R14 IF I HAVE TO TAKE 5 HOURS OUT OF MY DAY JUST TO RELAX IF I DON'T WANT TO GRIND MY LIFE AWAY JUST YET? I THINK I CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLY
---
A lot of them did use the same data.  Most Pservers didn't invent their own data.  But yes there were a couple versions and some that suped up difficulty on purpose.
---
&gt; If I remember correctly, you won't have the required reputation with Darnassus to be able to accept the quests in the starting zone.
---
Rep is not needed to quest. My human route does 5-9 in Teldrassil with 0 Darnassus rep at the start.
---
[Watch this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rsx2ARJyXY&amp;t=2s).
---
I didn't make this video or test this myself, so I cannot answer specific questions.
---
Thankfully I never lived in the basement.  And I didn't live with my parents at all after 18.  But I was fortunate.  It's fine to spend time living at home building some wealth and experience before moving out.  Renting is basically just pissing money away.
---
Spent less time getting those buffs and doing the raid than the people slogging through MC calling people who get world buffs tryhards will spend.
---
I'd rather log in to get buffs, log out of my raid character until raid night and go clear MC and BWL in ~1.5 hours total than be able to dick around on that character all week then waste 4-6 hours wiping, wasting time and gold in a raid that thinks getting world buffs in cheating or something stupid like that.
---
That's going to be interesting to find out!  Pservers have admittedly got a lot wrong (though some of it like armor of bosses makes it harder on pservers) but aggro range and pathing are things they could totally have wrong.
---
The transition is fine for the hunter, but I still doubt you'll have enough bank slots/do-enough-gathering to fuel Engineering on the others before you swap over. That being said googling the gold/hour of the various farming methods, they seem rather low, compared to what I could/was doing in Vanilla (Note: What I was doing was still subject to AH prices, so I won't comment on it here, my server could have just been an anomaly). I'm personally torn (my own characters) as to whether I want my Hunter to be Engineering/Blacksmithing, or Engineering/Enchanting and I'm literally planning to level up every class.
---
Druid's have travel form so you don't need to worry that much about not having a mount, additionally they have aquatic form (which is useful when you're looking for stranglekelp on the shore-line).
---
Given what we know about the Vanilla/Classic landscape and what consumables people will be willing to use (i.e. FAP, Grenades) I'd be seriously questioning why you'd want to make a Mage your PvP character, especially by the time ZG rolls around and classes (like Rogues) can pick up Renataki's which doesn't share a CD with Thistle Tea. FAP/(BoF: Paladins) nullify all Mage Slows/Freeze effects and it's not practical to do 'long casts' due to interrupt and pushback (not to mention Grenades). You might be fine in group PvP if you have an ungodly screen of meat-shields in front of you, in addition to a very on their on their game healer, but otherwise Hunters (which will out-range you) as melee will eat you alive at 60.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Engineering/Blacksmithing + FAP's (and just the game mechanics in general) more or less render most clothies impotent in a 1v1 scenario and much weaker in a group scenario, that's not even considering if people just carry a specific set of resistance gear to counter you, just because they can. If you're willing to flask and use consumables in all likely-hood your opponents will be as well. Are there any match-ups that you can envision where a 60 Mage comes out ahead in PvP if your opponents are willing to burn just as many (if not more) materials as you are? The type of player who wouldn't even blink at throwing down something like an [Arcane Bomb](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16040/arcane-bomb).
---
After you get your epic ground mount there's very little to spend your gold on, aside from respecs (I used to chew through 200g/week in respecs, but since I'd make that back from 'tips' it was a trivial amount to me). The more surplus funds you have, the more trivial item consumption becomes. If you're on PvP servers (and world dragons/bosses are a thing you can jump people on) it's pretty much a staple (Arcane Bomb) that you'll want to have at least 1 on you at all times (and with twitch/youtube/memes/viral videos the way are these days it only raises the incentive to drop one on a raid, causing a wipe).

---
Feed your Pet (you'll regret it if you don't).
---
It's not about skill or mechanics. It's about having 40 people who actually play the game. In MC you can have half the raid slacking all the time. In BWL you can't. When 20 raiders who don't slack wipe all the time because the other half doesn't do what they need to do (like not stay in fire, press Frostball on repeat), they start looking for other guilds and that old guilds disbands eventually with only slackers being left.
---
There will be another stress test.
---
You can't specify that everyone went back for the legendary drops juxtaposed next to the statement that no one went back after AQ.  Those statements can't both be true.
---
Haha, I'm actually working my way through your list right now!  Is there any chance you could update the top of the spreadsheet to include a link to the site to help drive traffic there?  It would really help :)
---
Hell yeah
---
Being a tailor gives 2% spell crit while wearing the set which is a huge free bonus better then anything another profession can give.  At that point you would be tailor / engineer.
---
&gt;do you think we'll struggle as much to find tanks for raids and dungeons in Classic as we did in Vanilla?
---
Yes, because the problem is the people in the groups. Vanilla tanking requires the party to control their own threat and to not be idiots. People are idiots. People won't control their own threat. Tanks will inevitably quit the game.
---
And then you'll be left with tanks like me, who won't put up with your bullshit and will kick you from the group.
---
To an extent yes, but looking at some of the races, the males are very not conventionally attractive in comparison to the females. Like male Orcs and Trolls are very not attractive, but you can make some straight up attractive looking female Orcs and Trolls.
---
Are you playing on a chair with a hole cut out the middle. Then you wont have to go anywhere. While you are at it make it a recliner if you dare sleep.
---
I dont do the streaming thing I find it pointless to watch someone play a game .but I understand some people just like to rush through content I guess as long as you have fun that's all that matters
---
we use ZQSD instead, ti's the same
---
not true, you can still kite with only taking one hit
---
This makes me very worried that the launch date is going to get pushed back. You don’t have zero communication when good things are happening behind the scenes.
---
Its still possible
---
Only the mage with ignites rolling, not every mage will be able to pump 1000+ dps on every fight only can have the ignite stack at a time
---
Well, it really comes down to what you enjoy. If my only goal in WoW was rank 14 in PvP, I wouldn’t be able to do that with my current time constraints. When there’s just not enough time to achieve your goal, working towards it just becomes a waste of time. If I need 8 hours a day to achieve it, but can only play for 2... then it’s just going to be frustrating to see myself coming up short every week because I can’t possible devote another 30 hours/wk of my life to a video game.
---
I think it shows more apathy/incompetence on their part rather than malice. I get why it bugs people here.
---
WC Radio without John won't be the same to me, I was a big Blue Plz fan. Still I only wish you good fortune :)
---
Current people manage to die on raid finder.  Fucking *raid finder*.  Shit literally does less damage than 5 man dungeons.
---
Then most likely the guild will take what it can get when it comes to raiding.
---
I know. It's an obvious question to see if they can do it and hope to not get caught.
---
Kinda seems like it...
---
Prioritize agi and stam and a little bit of int while leveling. 1-10 is rough but after that you’re golden. End game it’s pretty easy to gear, pre-bis is complex but I think your tier sets (besides 2.5) are pretty close to bis. Lot of resources out there for you.
---
Do NOT roll beastmaster spec for leveling. Yes it is the easiest way to level but it will not teach you how to be a good hunter. 
---
Take a hybrid MM /Survival spec like you would for PvP. 
---
Have you pet growl turned off. Learn to kite. Learn to trap. Pull multiple mobs at once. Die and learn from it 
---
Being a DPS turret behind your pet tank will not teach you good habits. 
---
Learn your optimal DPS rotation that you will use at 60. There is no point playing for a few months only to rewire your reactions later. 
---
Learn about clipped and non clipped rotations. Practice them.
---
Have all of your pet commands key bound and use them. Have all your abilities key bound (40+)
---
Aspect switch regularly. Use all your cooldowns.
---
Leveling to 60 on a hunter is easy. Do it in a way you can learn how to be a good one.
---
Druids can tank, dps, heal, stealth, and change forms. That's pretty hybrid.
---
I know right?  Some dude actually told me the other day, "Good luck finding a guild to take you as a night-elf holy priest".  What?
---
Or quit really early for the same reason.
---
Mindnumbing compared to retail WoW. While a lot of things in retail are much more simple and easy than vanilla, healing went the other way. The downranking requires a bit of effort to set up but not to actually play/use.
---
Sul has two green balls floating around it, this is warmonger but still beautiful nostalgia nonetheless
---
My biggest beef is when people say Saki instead of Sake....
---
Entertainment. 
---
I have 2 screens one for gaming and one for netflex/twitch/youtube.
---
i had wow sound mutet since tbc when i startet to play melee/tank specs, then i had to find some other sorce of sound. 
---
im not relly watching twitch for the games, more for the entertainment of the steamer
---
entrance
---
Yes. Very much so.
---
This is what I’ll be doing, though I may give up on leveling herbalism and just go back when I get a mount (or travel form since this is for my Druid). 
---
Even if you’re mailing it to an alt or banking it I’d recommend just waiting til you get a mount if you’re playing a class with bag space issues and don’t want to go crazy. Herbs, skinning, random greys and shit you need for your class (food, water, offspec shit if you’re gonna do a dungeon soon and want to heal/tank) take up a loooot of space, and the last thing you want to do in the middle of a questing spree is haul your slow ass back to the town 5-10 minutes away. Try to save your relevant level cloth and make friends with a tailor if possible for extra bag space, or use that skinning gold to buy some bags off the AH. 
---
There are a lot of inventory management addons floating around that can help with keeping your herbs away from the shit that needs to be vendored. I don’t know any off the top of my head but they’re not hard to find, I’m not sure if any are classic ready already though. 
---
Good luck!
---
So it isn’t as a big deal as people make it out to be. It is a contributing factor to why ally warlocks are more rare than horde. But in general warlocks are a rare to see class compared to mages.
---
And it’s kinda hard to say warlocks beat casters or whatever because of their build diversity. It is more accurate to say Sl/Sl beats melee instead of saying warlocks beat melee.
---
If you have grenades and if they pop wotf just chuck a made at them and then re fear them once it runs out.
---
Really good players will pre use Wotf to prevent fear from death coil. Like rogues will use it before a stun lock falls off if they know it won’t kill you so the kill is guaranteed. But imo your dead anyways if that happens regardless of WOTF.
---
Even then if your skilled and have a build for the context, warlocks can beat any class 1v1 assuming BIS gear on both sides and optional play. But the stars have to align in terms of your strategy.
---
Casters really don’t become broken op early game. Melle is the meta in early game because the gear they do get it 200x better than yours. Not until u get naxx gear you will struggle with better geared players.
---
But if you get T3 and ur good. You will be unstoppable.

Tauren are why I started playing WoW. I liked the cute cow people.

Vanillaguide is nice as long as you keep in mind it has xp reward values set a bit high so it will outpace you. The addon itself is really solid but knowing that you may need to jump to a zone not on the addon to keep up.
---
I use a dual monitor setup as well.  I don't really need background noise.  As I like to hear in game sounds and music.  I do have a decent amount of friends that play with all game sound off though.  Don't know how you folks do it.

I was this way too, but a couple of my friends talked it up and I got caught in the memories and feels bad enough that now I'm waiting for release right alongside them.

I’d go mining-engi then drop mining for tailoring for bloodvine.

Im like 95% sure im gonna go priest, but I have the feeling that when im in the loggin screen the shaman in me will call

Eh, tryin to price it together on mobile is harder than it seems
---
You can tank dungeons just fine as a DPS spec. Just throw on a lil extra threat gear.
---
It is though. Given that your rotation is spamming one button ur dps increase includes 
---
1)+ spellpower
---
2)crit, the more u crit the more dps u will do compares to someone who isn’t critic as much.
---
3) spell hit
---
4) spell rank.
---
Ze I believe is the new gender pronoun people are using.
---
How do you know at the beginning?
---
Warrior is a real chore to level. But you can rather easily tank all the 5mans until level 60 with a dps spec and a sword and board. You don’t need to level as prot to tank dungeons.
---
&gt;I’ve done like 15 corpse runs so far and I’m only level 7. 
---
You really shouldn't be dying that often, especially that early.  
---
&gt;you won’t be able to do the hamstring kiting in classic either. 
---
Yes you will be able to.
---
I kinda want to level as prot so maybe I’ll have to do less corpse runs.
---
Might have more issues than the class if you really died that many times by 7 lol. Paladin isn’t all that fun to lvl either, although I guess you’d definitely die less.
---
Lost touch with everyone from back in the day over the years, making a new group with some current friends and coworkers who used to play or always wanted to play.  I'm sure some will drop out before 60 but we almost got 40 people.
---
Don’t they take turns on the ignite to control aggro? I didn’t play vanilla so I may be wrong.
---
Ehh on fights like loatheb you HAVE to, or you'll die.
---
On other fights, you're gonna have to snipe my ignite if u want it ;)
---
