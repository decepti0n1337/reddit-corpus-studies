Druids are a major pain to play against if they learn to use all of their tools. Their utility and adaptability is unmatched.
---

---
Druid has one of the highest skill caps so there's a pretty big disparity between the good and bad ones. 
---
---
---
I guess it depends what your shit talk consist of. If it's racist or telling someone to kill themselves or threatening to kill them that will probably get you banned, but if it's just saying they suck shit at the game and they were too easy for you it'll probably be fine.  
---
What will interesting is if mass reports for spam with right clicks will auto mute the person as people will probably use that to grief.
---
I know right?  FUCK muru.  That shit was fucking impossible.
---
A hunter played well can top charts all day.
---
Pure beauty.

I think Wrath and TBC are at their core classic wow. I started in TBC raided in Wrath. Now I’ve been playing classic on private servers for 2 years. There are differences but they aren’t huge. I do Agree they introduced features that started its downhill slide. 
---
Out of curiosity, how were they handled?
---
As a gamer myself, I cannot wait to hurl slurs at women and minorities!
---
Naw. Back in the days people just knew how to do it right... and I assume they will lay off the people who can keep it in good taste.
---
The reason these companies have to crack down is because this gaming generation can't JUST talk shit... they have to be as edgy and vulgar as possible. They feel like they have to push every button they can.
---
This forces moderators to babysit since they can't trust the playerbase to compete aggressively without it resorting to throwing their poop at each other. 
---
Can you add fire to the bag and place it into a dumpster?
---
Holy shit!
---
You don't go either for raiding. Riposte is for leveling and it costs like 10 energy and disarms for 6 seconds. Hemo is for pvp. 
---
Nostalrius is closed so this forum link should be fine. Oto's Rogue guide. Pretty much all you will need to know for raiding. If it doesn't cover it, you also want a mainhand swing timer so you don't clip autoswings that can proc sword specialization. Press SS right after mainhand is done so you get more sword procs. Also you play around with the sword spec a little in BWL if he doesn't cover it and get 30 percent backstab because it's good on one boss. 
---

---
Now as far as Hemo for PvP there are lots of variations depending on what you are doing. Solo queue, premade, wpvp.
---
I would start with this spec for starters. There are a lot of variations but this should be safe to learn on and also provide some utility in premades with improved kidneyshot and help with rogue rogue mirrors. No spell batching in Classic  might make improved gouge worth it over heightened senses, 3/3 kidney. We will have to see if restealths happen in Classic or not.

---
Once you get all that down you can work in daggers, ambush talents and drop stealth talents if you are comfortable with it. This will help you vs mages. They should still beat you if they are good. On servers with lots of mages you go another spec with improved sprint, but you don't touch that until you get something like Perdition's Blade or the Rank 14 dagger. Learn Hemo first. Walk before you run. Some people never like daggers. Most rogues stick with hemo as it's the best anti rogue spec/mirror.
---
This is my favorite spec for wpvp solo queue (Mage killer spec) but like I said, don't touch it for a long time. It's much more gear dependent than Hemo. You can kill people naked with Hemo if they are mediocre.

TBC started to kill of wow with the dam flying mounts -.-
---
Lmao. Havent played wow in a long time but i remember link items with "anal" in front of it
---
What? WarCraft figures? I want some!
---
OP kinda has a dumb question, but if your first impression when you hear the term "shit talking" is racism and "slurs" against women, that's your problem.
---
The shoulder and legs from Nax and ZG made the item sb. That's why you had to use it on a white.
---
&gt;Kaplan flat out said that pvp is where "you can show what you got  
---
like in every pvp activity?   
---
&gt;Every game before that had PvP from Blizzard. Warcraft? Was Dune II with PVP 
---
Irrelevant. WoW is not a PVP game and completely different genre from their other games.  
---
You also seem to forget Diablo 1 and (more so) 2 which is pretty much exactly like WoW, where main content is PVE and pvp is side activity.   
---
So you are wrong there as well.  
---
&gt;Delusional people like you 
---
You are the delusional one, considering Kaplan is one of the people responsible for raids.  
---
Your fanboyism and ignorance is pretty funny.  
---
WoW is a PVE game with a pvp as a side activity. Always was and always will be.  
---
I feel like people that thought it was a dull raid never actually got to kill any bosses in sunwell..Kil'Jaedan pre-nerf was crazy hard
---
Sense you couldn't ask in a polite manner I'm going to be vague. It's all about timing and using the trade window.
---
Didn’t even know I still had them. Top of the closet in a box I found a treasure. 
---
Let's reverse that shall we!
---
Mage was my first class when I started in 2007. Made a warlock, hunter and warrior and played till 2009. None of them came close to the fun I had with my mage. Don't know what it was exactly. But the gameplay felt snappy and direct. 
---
Per the Classic AMA, PvE was the primary/sole focus for the class development team, and PvP balance was an afterthought if it was even considered. That not every spec was viable in raid was a failing due to lack of time, not some enlightened design.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9fb2bo/john_staats_ama_author_of_the_world_of_warcraft/e5v4lum/
---
Ya .. true
---
And for that you missed out on Ulduar, arguably the best raid that has  ever been released
---
I pretty much followed the exact same path. I only started playing once TBC was out. Then I reached 70 and couldn’t get raid invites due to poor gear so I just pvped an insane amount and did arenas with Stormherald and shit.
---
Then WotLK came out and I immediately quit my annoying guild that wouldn’t let me raid and changed servers to a higher population one, and managed to get up to spec to the point of doing good Fury Dps. Then from there I excelled in both PvP and PvE and ended up in ICC with an Orc warrior.
---
I was the raid leader for a modest progression guild of adults but we weren’t insanely focused on beating content like the top guilds, we’d just drink beer together and have fun clearing half of ICC per week. Eventually my gear got so good, I was an Orc Warrior mainhanding the 2250 arena 2 handed axe and offhanding some 25 man ICC 2 hander.
---
Anyways that is why WotLK was my favorite WoW experience as well, but Classic will still be a blast I’m sure.
---
Haven’t played since WOTLK, has it really gotten that bad?
---
I wonder if there is a "Prince Arthas, Paladin"
---
Stormwind : )
---
Congrats, but as 11 year olds (like myself) at the time, we had no idea what we were doing. I rolled a Dwarf Warrior and used the best two-handed axe I could find just because I really liked Gimli. 
---
100% agree
---
Mage : Zarthustra 2 - Overman - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlxx4R3qyE
---
I agree! 
---
for sure if both games were single player then retail would be funner, but they aren't, and community in an MMOrpg needs to be actually there. 
---
I agree with your first statement but not for classic, maybe a wow 2.0 later down the road that keeps classics ideals but with more current tech for the mechanics and complexity, although i don't want the graphics to be too crazy as that's usually pretty pointless and only serves to limit your audience, go for good looking not pure detail.
---
Late summer probably. Like september so not really summer.
---
/u/ggalpharaptor has the right outlook. When I played in Vanilla, I also absorbed a lot of feral DPS gear as well as securing extremely strong pieces intentionally (Boots of the Vanguard, Guise of the Devourer, Gloves of Enforcement, Mace of Unending Life, Etc).
---
When your gear gets good enough, you can actually mangle people in cat form with a bit lower gear / PvP skill and have a really fun and flexible time in PvP. Also, if you bring your healer gear, you can snap it on and quickly go to being a badass healer if the situation calls for it. 
---
Once your gear sets are good enough, you can use just about any feral/resto hybrid build and be quite competitive. When you only have one good set you may be somewhat stuck, but trust me, Druid’s always pick up gear, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly, always surely.
---
&gt;Seems like if the grind to 60 is the main point
---
It isn't. You pick a class you'll enjoy playing at 60.
---
We don't want him!
---
# WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT BOOMKIN SHIT?
---
Someone has to take him. Maybe he will go to a PvE server... 
---
Spot on. I enjoyed wrath more than you it seems, but this expansion was where it changed. Ulduar for me was the height of Warcraft. In Ulduar they peaked, and it's never reached that level since.
---
I was wating for this
---
Everything else in TBC I was fine with (I even liked the progression/attunement diagram), but Flying mounts I hated from the first day I saw one.
---
Im on my phone and i suck at it so ill keep it short. Your average player on a private server is much better thsn your average player in vanilla.  Sure. Private server players are willing to go to the nth degree.  Definitely.  Its the culture there.  The bar is raised. 
---
But lets not make it seem like there is some super secret ingredient that has since been discovered. 
---
Im not pvping or raiding ever again. Although i did do mc for kicks.  Arcane power and greens lol. can't comment on pvp but if what you said is correct the bar has been raised.  That's really all it is. 
---
Id just like yo point out your usage with the word we. Thats your generation. You were not the core audience. Mine was. 
---
I wouldn't even argue that. From a guy who's even studied game design as well as played through Uld when current: It's the single best mmo raid ever designed, genre wide imo.
---
Pretty sure that's a resto spec. We're talking about a dps casting spec here.
---
&gt;Seems like if the grind to 60 is the main point then just play a hunter or warlock?
---
That is a **BIG ASS IF**... Personally, the grind to 60 is like 5% of the game. The slog I have to get through to experience the good parts of WoW.
---
You should check out this YouTube channel great 1.12 druid gameplay https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCo4Fn7tCjnFSBATOE0lEekA
---
It was only for a week i believe but the white numbered auto attacks were just as large as our finishers. It was not a huge drama like it would have been these days, just a good chuckle and another reason to rib a huntard.
---
Whenever someone is equating moderation to safe spaces I think there's a high chance the guy just wants to call someone the n word without getting banned.
---
Not having crossrealm for BGs and arena would have completely destroyed the PvP scene on a lot of servers.
---
Imagine arenas where you're getting matched against the same team over and over because they're the only ones near you in score and you can't win against them. What do you do? Well you stop playing and dodge them, which is very easy to do because you can see when they're online and extrapolate if they're queing.
---
I get that not having cross realm makes server fame a bit of a thing but ultimately the health of battlegrounds doesn't come from recognising names but from having shorter queues and people not dodging each other. 
---
Lolwtf
---
Classic is on the 7.whatever client. Yes. You. Can. Don't believe me? Just go look at the armories of the twinks on xpoff. vanilla items with cata leg and mop shoulder enchant. It's a abusable glitch that was been around and still doable sense cata. 
---
Bit of a long video but to summarize: Preach goes over why gear stopped mattering and became nameless as time went on. The old gear system was much better as you could build a BIS list and would actually know the names of items.
---
I really miss the old system, when I still played BfA I could barely remember the name of any of my gear pieces as they are all interchangeable as compared to when I could plan out what gear I wanted. It something I am really looking forward to experiencing in classic.
---
Yeah, TBC was amazing and a good expansion but you could see some of the things that ruined WoW start to appear like flying mounts and daily quests.
---
They can be a nightmare 1v1 and very useful in battlegrounds. Go check out Swifty's incredible warrior tricks video from vanilla and check out the part where he duels a druid.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; Your average player on a private server is much better thsn your average player in vanilla.  Sure. 
---
This was my main point. A point you originally contended with saying that you knew how to play back in vanilla...
---
&gt; Private server players are willing to go to the nth degree.  Definitely.  Its the culture there. 
---
That culture will shift... In vanilla it was originally frowned upon to use bandages... As the game progressed bandages were accepted as a norm but potions were frowned upon as was engineering. Eventually engineering was widely accepted but using potions was still frowned upon... Culture changes based on what the majority of players are doing. What the majority of players are doing shifts based on influencers like high level PVP players or content creators. The culture will not be the same as it was.
---
&gt; You were not the core audience. 
---
I was the core audience of 18-35 year old males during vanilla retail. I will fall within the core audience for Classic as well.
---
Unfortunately, Priests are treated to a rickety wooden tower in Orgrimmar. What's worse is our neighbors are mages! Can't jump off the tower because of the invisible walls, so you have to run down. But yeah, doesn't feel like "home" there. And I almost never go to Undercity for priest training, but it feels more like home there.
---
Of course that will be a thing, why wouldnt it be a thing. Everyone is fair game, and that includes women and minorities. This coming from a latin american, if a gringo starts shitalking me, ill just shitalk back at them, no need for some white people with a saviour complex to “protect me” form words said through a game.
---
If Dire Maul isnt out when you hit 60 you guys could farm Winterspring JuJus to sell, there will always be a market for raiders. Bringing Mining/Herb will increase G/hr too with Rich Thorium all around Winterspring.
---
I didn’t like it but at the same time I didn’t hate it, Ulduar had so much thrash that ToC felt like fresh air for a while, the thing is that it was featured in a major patch and released alone. Didn’t they had plans for a bigger raid instead of ToC? I forget right now.
---
Will be apparent with a lot of time management and efficiency stuff as well. You will notice Pserver players surge ahead of the pack, they will set market prices and norms just as they have for years on pservers. The longer they stay on the top of the pack, the more they will influence. Then when it comes to gearing, they will gear MUCH faster, focusing on itemization and gouging the market where they can. When raiding starts I assume content will be timegated (I hope it is) and the edge they have will wither away as the main group catches up. By the time BWL comes out private server players will be at the same point everyone else is and that will likely remain the same for the duration of Classic. In BG's they will have a massive advantage for a very short period before their patterns are released by content creators and then the winning pattern will simply be replicated by retail players/new comers. At that point we will see new BG comps and raid comps emerge, likely due to changes that werent present on private due to inaccuracies or simply new changes that Blizz decides to implement on classes (ie. the nuances of certain spells and effects and how they will work in Classic).
---
Holy wall of text.
---
Would be cool to have three stages of Arthas. Paladin, Deathknight, and Lich King side by side
---
There was an old pvp video of a hunter or mage maybe that would use mind control cap on pvp opponents and force them to use cooldown abilities at the start of the fight screwing with their rotations. It was really clever
---
Most questions are answered in this thread already really, so I'll just pick one that hasn't been.
---
If you go for a prep build you have to go either Hemo or Daggers. You won't be able to reach deep enough into the other trees to support SS properly, and moreover Hemo is just really strong in PvP because of the CP generation. SS builds in PvP are more or less relegated to Adrenaline Rush builds.
---
1) I understand why some people haven't agreed with the direction of retail but it has been chugging along fine with some ups and downs.  I've been playing through the years and have always had fun with breaks in sub time here and there.  However...
---
2) Battle for Azeroth really is a dumpster fire.  For the first time in 13 years, it's not that I'm burnt out.  I just don't want to play it.  I'll probably check it out again when I resub for Classic, but I don't have much hope.
---
Does she have a Discord/Reddit? I'd like to commission as well.  
---
Regarding the part about dead communities: Even cleared tier 6 content except for the final two in sunwell pre 2.4.3 with random groups, many people on the server knew each other and had some reputation to their name (although the mentality of today where only achievements and/or gearscore count started slowly), people mostly were friendly towards each other and I´ve never met as many people in wow as back in tbc. The community only died down towards late wotlk, that was when on the server I was on most people decided to either quit or only go with their guilds.
---
I agree on the rest though, although I didn´t mind the leveling part so much.
---
What? First of all.. he got realm first Highmaul Mythic when he casually returned to WoW thanks to his Twitch stream (which btw had 8k+ viewers every WoW stream), but got so bored of WoD that he quit. Secondly, the game will never be too hard for people like Kungen, he's a fucking min-maxer to the highest degree when he actually plays.
---
The difference is that he actually wants to feel accomplished in the game he puts time into smashing the hardest raids. He wants to be one of the elite characters standing in the capital that everyone looks at in envy while passing by, you know.. having the feeling of an actual RPG game. What did he do when he got the mythic gear in WoD? He stood in his singleplayer Garrison because that's what Blizzard designed the content around.
---
It's not hard to understand what Kungen is talking about.. but you claiming that the game is too difficult for a guy like Kungen and his old guildies is just flat-out stupid. Not to mention that he "couldn't stay relevant" when he had 8k+ viewers every WoW stream he did..
---
I played the game non stop since release up to ICC patch, when i got bored and started taking breaks to play other games. I semi quitted about 2 months into cata, and since then i usually only play 2-3 months per expansion.
---
avatar ong
---
This exactly. From my experience on private, where content is releasing TWICE as fast as on retail, you will have PLEEEEENTY of time to play casually and still catch up. The players are the top will spend time camping rare spawn pets (if its valuable), rare spawn mobs to get very rare items like the Tidal Charm, farming gold etc etc etc... I have a friend who plays private with me and can only play about 20 hours MAX per week and usually only shows up for raids. He hit 60 about 2 months after us and found himself inside MC with us and is continuing forward through all the content. Keeping up is not an issue if you are focused on one character and can play 1-2 raid nights per week. 
---
Straight up assumed it was like Runescape and didn't realize I had a choice of class. Made it to level 34 before someone pointed out talents. Used a staff like some warrior monk. Good times. 
---
Doing raid content in a raid group = raiding.
---
Everything else is just No True Scotsman bullshittery. 
---
&gt; Depends on how accurate they are. 
---
They arent 100% accurate, but they are 95+% accurate and thats all that really matters... The individual numbers are less important than the gross amount of experience and knowledge players have about the game. Was a bosses health off by X% or was his phasing timed incorrectly? Possibly. But that is peanuts when considering ALL that these players know... Especially when you consider the ease with which they are crushing PVE content. The bosses could be 25-50% more challenging and they would still surge through the content. Everything pre AQ is laughable with proper knowledge, ability and itemization.
---
Oh, that makes sense. I saw a lot of white gear enchanted for alts but I thought it was just white for convenience's sake, greens with +2stam doesn't really matter that much and you can just buy white gear from vendors. Thanks for the info. 
---
Best part about wrath was it was well designed for travel and flying mounts and such. At least I thought so. The area you had to patrol to get the time lost proto drake...I loved that area. 
---
But it was certainly the last good expansion and the writing on the wall was becoming clear. 
---
instead of just being a difficulty setting, they were triggered by in-game interacions, like pushing the big red buton for mimiron or dpsing the heart for XT.
---
You know the devs admitted that PvE inbalance was not what they wanted, right? 
---
It is a text based forum... And I type 120 wpm... And im chatty...
---
Could you just hit enter a couple of times? I literally can’t read what you typed.
---
Yup, yup, yuuuuup. They are also in tight with most of the higher level streamers so their influence will affect most/all of the content creators who will in turn affect the entire playerbase.
---
I wish I was this edgy.  
---
It shouldnt. Take it as an opportunity to improve. I think many people were anticipating an authentic Vanilla Retail experience, where they could walk into the game completely oblivious and explore an untouched world... I mean... Thats the EXACT opposite of "NO CHANGES". We asked for the same puzzle, that we can solve the same way, that weve already solved, that we know how to solve... We are not going to have any surprises (that we know of).
---
When I see some fucker doing something stupid I'll call them out in public chat every time. I'm tanking and that idiot of a mage pulls the enemy off of me with Arcane Missiles because he doesn't have the Arcane Subtlety talents? You can bet your ass I'll give him a lecture in front of everyone.
---
I dont spend much time formatting my posts on reddit. Its a pretty casual text based forum. If its too much of a pain youre not obligated to read it. Though I sure would appreciate it if you did =)
---
I was pretty experienced at RPGs/MMOs so I was pretty good.  Won 3v1s frequently and such.  My only issue was that instead of using W to move forward(along with the mouse) I bound W to autorun.  I can't tell you how many embarrassing situations I got myself into because of that.  Thankfully my embarrassment forced me to change my muscle memory.

Ever slightly different style from Finalflash but still super skilled.  
---
I always loved the climb up to the top of the fire totem stone in Durotar.
---
The first boss "corridor" has four towers signifying 4 natural elements.  depending on if you destroyed all 4 towers, the boss would be normal.  If you left 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the towers remaining and engaged the boss, there would be multiple "Hard Mode" mechanics activated.   Most of the Bosses in Ulduar had Hard Modes that engaged in different ways.
---
 There was a "Bonus Boss" Algalon that was only available for one hour per week after you pull him.   Which means it may take you weeks to learn the fight.
---
Also memorable was the final boss who you engaged various forms of Hard Modes by asking 1-4 Heroic Spirits to not help you with the encounter.
---
On all of the 25 Man Hard Mode bosses, there was special loot that only dropped from Hard Modes. 
---
Tbh it could be much, much worse. Remember during the announcement all of these retards posting about they wanting dual spec and rebalancing etc. Even such a thing as the debuff limit and mail delivery time shows me that they want the authentic experience as much as possible.     The loot trading thing is bad and all however we must acknowledge that it affects quite a few people. In most cases you'll identify the player as a ninja anyways and on closed servers they will be ostracized just like a normal ninja. The only place it would work is if the friends can use the same item but one of them already got it, so he unequips it and rolls anyways as if he needs it, but intends to give it to his friend. Even there you can't do it mid-dungeon because it has a 15-minute duration which means he has to get out of the dungeon and trade the item before that time is up. If he trades it immediately it'll look fishy that he doesn't equip the item, and the old item doesn't have a timer on it so we can easily see which is which. 
---
It's a hassle but imo a small price to pay for the convenience of correcting a loot mistake. 
---
&gt; I will eagerly await this and enjoy it more than I can describe. 
---
Just as they will revel in bullying an incompetent player and asserting their ingame dominance. Haha. I know enough to get me by and be at the top of the pile and then coast, thats my gameplan. 
---
I still see people using the leveling experience as a metric to decide which class to choose, and in the same breath talk about how their top goal is hardcore PVE.  
---
It's amazing how people will change their class for a one-time problem that makes up a lower percentage of their play as time goes forward.  
---

moves in closer to make comment
---
&gt;That wasn't true in vanilla and TBC
---
This wasn't really the case in TBC already. I also wouldn't really call that a fault of catch up mechanics, but more so loot quality and quantity. It's not like you could get a full set of gear powerful enough to get you into Black Temple or ICC straight away, but it was just fine to be lower geared because you'd get geared quickly anyway.
---
Anyway, returning to TBC, Karazhan was something that you'd frequently see run throughout the expansion. It was an easy entry-level raid, getting 10 people together was easy, people liked it, and it dropped good loot for alts. But SSC and TK were phased out pretty much the moment they removed the attunements, and those were removed fairly quickly. Even before the removal of the attunements, people kept the SSC/TK runs to a minimum preferably. The problem was simply that BT/Hyjal dropped more loot than 40-man bosses did for almost half the number of people.
---
Furthermore, as Blizzard had figured out itemisation by then, there really weren't that many items from SSC/TK which were BiS even in later raids. The fact that most items dropped were good, as opposed to the quantity of crappy items in vanilla, also just further worsens the whole plethora of loot problem.
---
By making raids drop a lot of loot, and ensuring that each raid has items better than the last, you're essentially cutting off your own content. Truly, itemisation is an area in which Blizzard would've been better off staying clueless.
---
Stormwind Park, for my Druid Trainer. (RIP)

Another reason vanilla is great, if you have no social skills and struggle to make friends you can just play an in demand role like tank or dwarf priest and people will tolerate you anyway.

Classic WoW is the best gaming experience I've ever had, hands down. It's worth more than what it costs. Finding friends is easy in classic as you'll be interacting with other players a lot. This sub is a good place to find friends as well!
---
That’s entertaining stuff, hadn’t seen that before 
---
I think you might be looking for /r/WoW or maybe /r/WoWRAF/.
---
/r/ClassicWoW is for the original version of the game, without any expansions, which is currently being rewritten and expected to be released in "summer" of 2019, probably around July.
---
-
---
I can't speak much for the current version of WoW, I stopped playing it many years ago.     
---
I rarely hear anything positive from it these days.    
---
The game has changed so much from what it originally was and is almost unrecognisable.    
---
But as a new player you'd likely have a different view.
---
If you're interested in checking out Classic at all when it comes out, it should be very easy to meet up with people and make friends in game.
---
Apparently the current version of the game isn't that great when it comes to the social aspect of things. Due to the game the game has now been designed.    
---
But this is one of the many things that Classic does very well.    
---
You will be drawn together with your fellow players all the time.
---
Great option for PvP and solid for PvE as well. Great class, why not?
---
No, current wow is not worth playing at all. Classes feel bad to play and everything is both tedious and easy. Nothing feels rewarding. Leveling is a total chore. 
---
It might take you awhile before you realize how much it sucks because you lack the fatigue and experience with the game but you're going to hit that point well before you should. 
---
this has nothing to do with rogue
---
First character I leveled was a tauren druid. Got him to 24ish.
---
I ran WC so many times under the assumption that the blue mace stinging viper was exactly what I needed to level faster.
---
I finally got it. I never used my spells. Never used my forms. I just melee auto attacked with the blue mace...smh
---
So, this is a subreddit for Classic WoW. Classic WoW is not released yet. It comes out this summer. Classic WoW is basically like a re-released version of the very first World of Warcraft game that originally came out in like 2004. This 2004 WoW is no longer available to play. If you want to play WoW right now, you will have to play the "retail" or modern version of the game. We here on this subreddit really really like the very first version of WoW that came out back in 2004 and we're excited for it to be released this summer. The current version of WoW is under heavy criticism right now because a lot of people think that it has devolved from what used to make the game so great back in the early days of WoW's life. 
---
Dungeon finder didn’t come in until the end of wrath my dude. Mostly agree with you, but there was no dungeon finder until the ICC patch. And the dungeons released in that patch were fairly difficult iirc; they got a lot of backlash from the ToC 5 man being a joke so they ramped it up for the next round.
---
The turning point was the popularity of the GearScore addon. Blizzard saw it and everything else followed.
---
I didn't even know there was a classic WoW, When I thought "Classicwow" meant like the vanilla game. I didn't know it was a different game entirely... 
---
Is it that bad?
---
Will I have to play a fee every month or so to play Classic WoW?
---
Yeah. The standard WoW subscription will cover both BFA and Classic.
---
The game is undoubtedly in the worst state it has ever been and I honestly don't see how they come back from it. We're all here because we just want the game from 15 years ago to come back. 
---
If you're wanting to play an MMO just pick literally any others, current wow isn't even an MMO anymore. 
---
Ah ok. 
---
May I ask what made Classic WoW such a great game? 
---
I was so bad and so poor I didn’t learn 100% mount speed until BC.  I just played the whole time with the shit slow speed mount until BC.
---
I also remember not understanding need/greed and would constantly get fussed at for rolling Need.  My thought process was I needed it for gold.
---
I have no idea what I spent my money on. 
---
Still sucks that you're forced to wear cloth as a Paladin at max level. Blizz could have made some craftable plate healing gear at least for blacksmiths 
---
Blizzard has been cracking down on "toxic behavior" like crazy. I don't even play blizz games and I hear about it all the time. Changing rules, banning people, etc. I'd be careful tbh.
---
Yeah, you have the right idea. But yeah, WoW originally came out in 2004 and they've added a bunch of expansions over the years. Each expansion basically overrides and adds more content on top of the previous expansion. But you can't just be like "oh I like this expansion, so I'm just going to play this one and not get the new one". But the developers have finally decided to allow players to return to the vanilla game with Classic WoW's release 
---
Keep in mind this might not even be the question you want to be asking. If a class is countered by one other spec of a class that is absurdly rare, it shouldn't count nearly as much as losing to something common.
---
I agree its probably mage or warlock. Warlock beating mage, and Rogues beating warlocks. UD mage seems like the best bet to both play on the faction that faces less warlocks and to get a fighting chance with WotF. 
---
Except displaying pretty rogue like character traits
---
Warlocks get wrecked by hunters in group pvp, mages to a lesser extent as well.
---
What i mean was, wich class has most chance at winning any 1v1 encounter. #1 is mage u say? #2 warlock?
---
From what i understand mages &amp; locks are better at 1v1 them hunters against most classes?
---
He sounds real salty 
---
mage and rogue are 3 tiers above everything else
---
Yeah #1 mage #2 warlock. UD mage in particular, but the extra benefits in 1v1 would be at the cost of Blessing of Freedom/Blessing of Sacrifice and Gnomes in group PvP. 
---
This really says a lot about society, and the fact that we live in it
---
who?
---
It also introduced welfare tier gear. You could buy tier helm with badges.
---
Are you on a US realm? Then there’ll be loads of racism, yes.
---
Been playing full resto in BG's on a private server. The mobility is absolutely unrivaled. If you know what you are doing, you can definitely carry a group to victory. You dont get top killing blows, but you *feel* your contribution 
---
Good find! This is worth at least $11! ... I dunno. But awesome anyways!
---
Itemization for hybrids is very weird in classic overall, probably the saddest part about it.
---
Rogue better then warlock? Sure?
---
i'd call it a balance spec kill people with wrath and moonfire. a typical resto spec would have swiftmend.
---
MAGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Balance druids are craaaaazy good in world pvp. Incredible mobility with travel form, bear charge, shift out of roots and slows, cat form with stealth etc etc. Good cc with bash, pounce, and entangling roots. They also have very strong healing if u have decent gear. And the dmg.. omg if you pounce rip, Insect swarm moonfire.. entangling roots and wrath and or spam moonfire people will definitely die. Con for this class. It's probably the class with the highest skillcap, and you have to utilize everything in your kit to make it work. If you wanna see how to play this class near perfectly go watch "Stormx 3" on youtube. 
---
 Nice try, name-squatter.
---
Im not saying i like loot council,  just that it worked without drama in this one case. The council also wasnt made up of that "inner circle"..id only call those 5 that because they were my 5 man mythic + team and we played wow together 6 nights a week.
---
Give me a loot system that gives loot out in a way that most benefits the raid team as a whole without me having to vote/dish out items and I'd be all over it. Loot council was a hassle more than anything. 
---
Depends on gear, mages work pretty well with nearly no gear, warlocks are much more gear dependant.
---
Do rogues do ok without being all geared up or are they dependant.
---
If you do raid content, you're a raider. That's the only criteria. Doesn't matter if you're clearing everything, doesn't matter if you do it late. Go away with your misplaced elitism. 
---
[Read this](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/37110-new-loot-feature-bop-item-trading-updated/) , more specifically:
---
Q: Can enchanted or gemmed gear be traded if done within the two-hour window? 
---
A: When you attempt to modify the item by applying an enchant or gem, you will receive a confirmation box informing you that the modifications to the item will remove the trade timer and permanently bind it to your character. Once confirmed, this item can no longer be traded. 
---
No you can not trade items after they are enchanted. Never have been able to never will be able to.
---
They do very well at low gear, evicirate doesn't go off of weapon damage.
---
When will Classic WoW be released? Summer of 2019?
---
Daggers is very gear dependent and Hemo is less. Daggers has a much better chance vs. mages at the cost of every other matchup. Rogues in general are better when the early raids are released (MC &amp; BWL). 
---
Dib and Dibi?
---
Probably not, with nublizz offending somebody is grounds for a ban.
---
This one you mean: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIp9bKlQMLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIp9bKlQMLM) ? Or did he make another tbc video? I know he had some random short videos that was cut out, along with some guest appearances with another mage, i think it was Noone or something. He was apparently gonna make a video with him during tbc i think, but it never happend for some reason, might be mistaken tho.
---
I really, really want to get Rhok'delar on my (eventual) hunter main. I've been fascinated by it and the quest chain for literal years.
---
Godspeed on your goal
---
You’re not factoring in Lupos’ attacks ignoring armour And getting shadow weaving damage buff. So you have two scenarios; one where no hunters are using Lupos and their wolf/cat damage is being mitigated by boss armour but the warlocks shadow bolts are being increased by 20%. The other being multiple Lupos’ in the raid consuming the debuff and ignoring boss armour. 
---
With the increase in pet dps and little to no improved shadowbolt overlapping (because of frequent Lupos attacks) you will find that scenario 2 is higher raid dps and less chance of warlocks going over the tank threat.

---
Did you read what I wrote? It's a glitch. Meaning not intended. Those glove reinforcements have a level 60 requirement. How do you explain  a level 29 getting an enchant that has a level 60 requirement on a BOP? Those leg enchants also can not be applied through trade window.
---
Yeah this pretty much sums up most of the vanilla community lol
---
Get out of here Alliance Filth! 
---
You sound like a fun guy to be around.
---
I just told you how if you read the comments of the enchants you can see how. The glove reinforcements can be applied via trade window. The legs are a boe so they can be applied then traded.
---
You are daft dude. Really fucking daft.
---
&gt;you pounce rip, Insect swarm moonfire.. entangling roots and wrath and or spam moonfire people will definitely die.
---
You have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about.
---
I played a Druid. Here’s the lowdown. You can own rogue/warriors/mages in open world. Locks/Shamans/Paladins/Hunters/Priest own you. 
---
Yes.
---
You're a fucking idiot. You have no clue about any of the items you're talking about. Here is a very old post from when the glitch became more apparent of twinks sharing the glitch with each other on how to get glove reinforcements on a BOP. It's the same glitch for the leg/shoulder enchants.  
---
https://xpoff.com/threads/questions-answers.49328/page-174
---
"I need to put it on BoP gear tho
---
you can only put it on gloves which is in your bag. thus the only possible way in adding it to bop on low lvl is :
---
- to do a dungen with high lvl player
---
- get item you need
---
- let high level get it and enchant it
---
- exploit trade while enchanting it at last sec before trade. (if it hasn't been fixed)
---
Note that some are not dumb. ppl will see that you got bop item with enchant it is not possible to obtain as low lvl. 
---
Several people got bans and item removed for exploiting gem slot on gloves this way.
---
Also may wanna tell what item u wanna enchant for lol? as ppl said already there is not a item that worth the effort."
---
The items you linked don’t fall into that category. The glove enchant can be applied via trade window. The legs with the enchant on that character are BoE. Meaning that anyone with the leg armor can apply it and send it back.
---
So tell me where am I wrong? What am I missing? Nothing I am missing nothing. You have poor reading comprehension and are blaming an old glitch for two items that I just explained how they got the enchants they have.
---
Depends on if you're solo or group. Rogues and mages are generally tough to deal with...
---
You're right i don't. I have just watched tons of druid pvp videos where this has happened but yeah you right you right. How about you enlighten me oh wise Archdruid. Tell me your ways.
---
Here are two examples of a PvP fight:
---
Druid v Priest: 
---
yes, finesse classes are always superior to tank classes
---
What would u say is easier for a noob to learn or do well with, mage or rogue.
---
&gt;I decided to melee as a hunter because arrows cost too much money.
---
Already enough to be top comment.
---
Alliance mage towers, both as quest hubs or to go deal with rogue mages who stole secrets, or recover knoledge for mage towers that were invaded by something.
---
Also the big mage tower in SW.
---
Mages!
---
Solution: merge dead servers together. Blizzard refused to do this despite eons of fans begging for it.
---
The weak should fear the strong.
---
No like I literally can’t read what you said. I have dyslexia. 
---
The question was **What classes have the least counter classes in pvp?** 
---
A priest is not a counter to druid. No one dies in a druid v priest matchup. Druid has the least counter matchups to any class.
---
I was responding to a different thought.
---
But I do agree, druid is low on the totem pole in regards to who it has pvp advantages over. Other than rogue, there isnt a single class that I think druid is a counter too.
---
Just like you, 2019, I had a warrior "tank" in SM Lib, who never used defensive stance and didn't even use sunder armor. He had no ranged weapon. He would just charge in and face pull everything, and didn't even wait for people to drink.
---
I was being the extremely nice and patient OG that I am, explaining to him the basics of tanking. He seemed to pick up a little bit. But it was just a lost cause. After maybe the 9th wipe I called it and we disbanded. It was sad. We had a good laugh though, since we were 4 guildies and this 1 random warrior.
---
He answered a LFG call again in the future. He wasn't invited to the party.
---
You're missing the part where all the twinks are talking about exploiting the trade window?  You're the fucking one who can't read. I'm the one who has literally done the glitch myself. You run the dungeon. Get your BOP to drop, pass to 60+, open trade window and places item in normal trade(NOT ENCHANT TRADE), then he enchants and clicks trade at 98% bar. Here is a video of a twink using the exact same glitch to give a level 19 twink wrath cobalt frag belt enchant. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OHsxyLMN2M
---
What do I know? I'm just following what our Naxx progressed RL/GM said.
---
Oh yeah from 4 years ago. Yeah that’s relevant you moron.
---
Leveling mid 40s got ambushed by 2 undead mages (was a mage myself). I was tailor/ench so I was very well geared and just finished my class quest wich award me my wand.
---
Since it was 2v1 it was really hard but I won. The last 2 minutes of the fight were just 2 mages fighting with stick since we both ran out of mana, the final blow I jumped and critical hit the hordie. Damn when you have more fun with sticks than the literal ashbringer, smh.
---
I was being conservative. It's really, really hard to tell what Classic is going to be like compared to pservers.
---
I really don't know, but I feel like the noob factor is going to be turned up to 11, despite all the knowledge available today.
---
&gt;Unholy shit!
---
It's just that druid has so fucking much in their kit to work with they can't be "countered" per se except for maybe a warrior with insane gear. But yes they don't really counter any class either, but they are super good when you utilize their kit properly. Since they can't really one-shot or have heavy cc they can't really kill healers, but they can whittle down dps classes very effectively. 
---
Got it. You can’t back it up so it probably doesn’t exist. Take care. 
---
WotLK is 100% my favorite expansion. Even above Classic. I don't know what it is about Northrend but I felt so connected with the community. It was the perfect intersection of streamlining the rougher edges of classic, but not being SO easy mode as to remove the fun parts. It was perfect. The raids were all unique and relevant to the story. The dungeons were fun. Gear wasn't totally monochrome yet but still felt like cohesive sets. It's the perfect MMO experience, at least in my book. 
---
here you go cry baby. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OHsxyLMN2M. It's the same concept different enchant. 
---
I’m not the one crying.
---
It's more like 30g/hour. Very rarely will you hit 40g/hour, and you'll never hit above that. This is as an MM hunter in full T1 with Rhok'delar.
---
Boo hoo. Just thank me and move on
---
Died for me on my first “new Naxx” run, where I realized that even the raids had become an aoe-fest.  
---
There’s a comment from three months ago that says it was patched. 
---
Why are you crying about it and insisting it still works?
---
Reading is hard. 
---
Yeah your GM and everyone else on this sub lol. Anyone can clear Nax, I’m strictly talking about min max raid damage, just play any class let your hunters play with any pet it is irrelevant small amounts of damage difference. Some people want there warlocks to look good on a dps meter I guess 
---
Again, you're not in the scene. Like always blizzard fixed the symptom and not the disease. They patched the cobalt nade. Not the glitch. Just like they patched the gem sockets. Not the glitch. Why can't you accept someone knows something you don't? You obviously don't play retail. So why does it matter to you?
---
I do play retail. 
---
You’re pretty fragile. Just admit you’re wrong. The glitch is fixed. It’s not in the current client. They will be using an updated client for Classic specifically so bug fixes like this will be automatically incorporated. 
---
Stop ranting and throwing mud at everyone here for disagreeing. It won’t be a problemm 
---
While this topic is an over-saturated one on this subreddit, I thought I'd still offer my two cents and see what you guys have to add. Pumped for Classic.
---
This comment is such a parody unto itself.
---
I will admit. I thought you were someone else so the retail part was not the correct thing to say. My point still stands. They did not fix the glitch they did band aid fixes on specific items that the glitch made OP. My whole thing with you was you came out swinging instead of asking for help. So do you want my help or not? I can tell you how to do with out wasting gold.  
---
Its the reason I never saw ICC. I just couldn't hold on long enough. I un-subbed after a month of ToC.
---
I’m not asking for your help. I responding to you stating that this will somehow be a problem in Classic. 
---
It won’t be. A glitch that requires you to exploit lag, in order to trade an item that has already been enchanted won’t really be an issue. Especially since most enchants in Classic can be applied to anything. 
---
In the case of what the OP is discussing, e.g. Naxx enchants ending up on twink gear, it’ll get reported and the accounts involved will get a temp ban. Then blizz will patch it.
---
That’s assuming people want to waste Naxx or ZG enchant materials and potentially waste them, if their timing isn’t perfect. Since both of those categories of enchants are stupidly expensive.
---
So I don’t really see it being a problem. Even if it’s possible due to exploitation. It’s absolutely not possible if you play as intended. 
---
Thrall liked to keep his shamans close in his great hall. Walking the back way deep down into Orgrimmar was always great whenever I could, seeing the guards become lv60 elites was always so cool and I felt important to the horde.
---
TBC was my favourite but tbh the story of wc3 ends at wotlk so i think everything after that is dumb
---
This guy made a 1-3 of these videos back in the day. Worth a watch. It addresses how rogues can get buy with minimal gear. Think in one of the vids he kills a Grand Marshal warrior while being naked and using starting daggers.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw)
---
lol no.
---
warlock is the hard counter to a hunter.
---
This is even more effective on mage because you can spam poly on whatever they're attacking, and sure they can break poly, but it often gets a tick or two of healing off and if you do it over and over you can pvp your own faction with mobs
---
There is no other content to post here. Informative posts are the only reason I'm on this sub even though I know most of what I need. Much more interesting than backseat amateur game dev posts or shitty memes. 
---
There is a way to practice with out wasting expensive mats. It only takes about 5-10 times before you master it and get 100% chance rate. They also don't ban for it. The last time action was taken was in cata when the gear was taken with no ban. reasoning "clever use of game mechanics."
---
This whole time I have been trying to say. There is a way. It's the oldest advantage glitch. Blizzard hasn't done anything about it in 9 years. So if you don't want it in classic maybe start telling people about how a current glitch can give a level 19 player 15+sp with hit/int or 24+AP with crit or hit 
---
Literally all we can do right now is talk and plan out what we are gonna do. And with this much hype building people tend to want to share and research things about classic. I sort of agree that discovering things on your own is super fun, but if people want to have a gameplan then let them. It's up to the player to decide their playstyle.
---
Ultimately if I had to guess I would say it's not going to really change anything. They're going to treat it as millions of people are nostalgic and want to revisit the game and that will be it. Ideally they would take away from that that the game used to be more appealing, but I don't expect that's going to be the case and I don't think they're going to change wow in any significant way in order to try and bring back the appeal of classic in the current game. This is made evident by the fact that in the interviews the executive producer of wow stated that they were surprised by the demand of classic considering the game was still being made. Clearly they have blindfolds on and their fingers in their ears and they're trying to appeal to a different modern audience with current wow and all they pay attention to is data and metrics and ways to get people to play and pay more. Their design Focus has shifted from good gameplay from a human perspective into what's mathematically most likely to get more subs or playtime, and even though it hasn't worked they're oblivious to that. So yes I think they will realize that a lot of people want classic but I don't think they're going to make that connection that the reason they wanted is not just because they want to revisit the game out of nostalgia but because of it's appealing MMORPG aspects and difficulty.
---
Agreed. Leveling also lack any kind of challenge.
---
Lord Farquaad?
---
&gt;We are looking at a revival, a Resurrection of gigantic supernatural proportions here, the likes of which could rival or surpass league of legends, fortnite, or even convince some companies to make "Classic Clones".
---
Nah. Vanilla was like 5 million players and WOTLK (at its peakj) was 12 mil IIRC. Fortnite and LoL are both quite a bit bigger than that as far as i know.
---
Omg mate how much time have you got?
---
I was bad with money and I didnt get my mount until my mid-40's, when a guildie gave me a loan of 20g IIRC so I could afford it. I managed to pay him back within maybe a week or two.
---
At 60, i wasnt that bad. I could heal UBRS and the 5-man dungeons (they were 15 and 10 man when i started, which made them way cooler in my mind) but my raiding guild was absolutely atrocious. We raided MC for 4-5 hours 3 days a week and we got to one of the big giants. I never saw Rag or any other endgame boss.
---
As long as you got a row of numbers and an F-key row, thats completely fine for raid healing.
---
I played a druid in vanilla. I can say that I was never ganked by another druid, and I never ganked any other druid either. It was sort of an unwritten rule, druids just didn't fight eachother. 
---
Haha, I thought he looked like Prince Charming from shrek.
---
First 60 (this will take months), then clear as many raids as I can (I never saw an endgame boss on a Live server and I have yet to kill one in Vanilla. Its always been a goal). Finally, EPIC MOUNT.
---
Warlock and Rogue for sure. 
---
You have to pass tests and traps just to get through the cave to the manor, one of the most flavorful places in the game. 
---
100 million lost subs? Where are you making up these numbers from??
---
Anyway what'll happen is the majority of people who think Classic WoW is the best will play and/or resub only to give up on it shortly thereafter. Maybe if it was remastered with some current day bells and whistles like multiple raid and dungeon difficulties, dungeon matchmaking, etc.. I just feel like OG Vanilla WoW didn't age well. TBC was better, then Wrath was better, etc...
---
Who knows, maybe spending an hour in trade chat trying to make a group for UBRS will be more fun than I remember. Afterwards I can spend all my time collecting mats for the raid in which my class will be pigeonholed.
---
&gt;they're going to treat it as millions of people are nostalgic and want to revisit the game and that will be it.
---
This is true for the vast majority, absolutely correct. But what I stated was that even with a significant drop of subscribers, the initial subscriber numbers are likely going to be in the millions here, and that's just those who are excited/preparing for classic, not those who will hear about Classic in the months thereafter. 
---
&gt;I don't think they're going to change wow in any significant way in order to try and bring back the appeal of classic in the current game.
---
They would likely be forced to do this if Classic was hitting those milestones though. The embarrassment of having a 14 year old game have more subs than the current game can't be fixed with the continuation of the status quo. 
---
Yes, I also believe modern WoW developers are blind and uncaring of game and design by committee and spreadsheets. They're woefully unprepared and are disregarding Classic as a serious product with a longevity that could surpass the current game; this only makes Classic even more powerful. 
---
The answer to all your questions is Mage/Rogue/Warrior, except healing.
---
I was eleven when I started playing. I thought ghost wolf made you go invisible so I would run around “taunting” alliance in the barrens. Of course they would kill me and I would be left wondering how they saw me. 
---
I think you deliberately didn't read my post. 100 million players have quit WoW over it's lifecycle. Those players have their own reasons for quitting. Whether that's moving on because they don't have the time anymore or having a growing dislike of the game. 
---
Even if a tiny fraction, 1% of 100 million players came back to the game, which isn't realistic at all, the game would have 1 million players. 
---
Let's not forget, the current game has anywhere between 2-4 million subscribers. 
---
"Play the game the way I want you to!"
---
I feel every expansion slowly added to the downfall of WoW. Some examples:
---
\- TBC added flying mounts and arenas. And arenas required much more homogenisation of classes. [Even Rob Pardo (a WoW designer himself) stated arenas was a mistake](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/678756-Rob-Pardo-Arena-was-a-misake). I know many people like arena's, but they have no place in an MMO as far as I am concerned, unlike battlegrounds. Also I feel it'd have been better if horde didn't get paladins and alliance didn't get shamans. I don't like the "manga" blood elf design either.
---
\- WotLK added Dungeon Finder, achievements. I also don't find phasing is great, at least not in the way it was used in WoW. Phasing could be cool if it was used for the destruction and conquering of cities and objectives in World PVP I guess, but not sure if Blizzard ever used it in this way. WotLK also really started the welfare epic craze and made Heroic dungeons easy mode AoE spam (with some exceptions).
---
\- Cataclysm added LFR. And pretty much ruined (simplified) the whole low level questing experience. The questing experience became a theme park and I believe the exp gains were much increased as well. Many old dungeons were simplified as well to become a 1 corridor experience IIRC - or that might have been a later expansion. 
---
\- I didn't play much Pandaria and any expansion afterwards, but I am sure it added some bad things as well. One of the things I thought was really crappy was the addition of all the pets and mounts, some to be paid for with money. 
---
\- As Kungen stated (and I agree) every expansion destroyed old content, made it worthless. So that in itself is bad game design as well. Perhaps it'd have been better if TBC and every expansion afterwards didn't raise level cap, perhaps only slightly increased gear quality. Perhaps then people would still play old raids after the release of every new expansion.

Right-click to report will censor everyone.
---
Hi, /u/Atheist_n_fkn_proud
---
That is very dishonest. What Im talking about has nothing to do with how you play the game, just how a small amount of people ruin epicness of the game by doing stuff outside the game(especially youtube)
---
Trial accounts aren't lost subs. I made an extra account for one of those recruit-a-friend promotions with the bonus XP and mounts. I also made a trial account for reasons I do not know.
---
Gold sale spammers used trial accounts for a number of years until more restrictions were placed on them.
---
I'd say the number of customers lost is actually much lower.
---
Let's be generous and say that 75% of the 100 million(+) accounts were owned by gold sellers or were trial accounts. 
---
25% of 100 million is 25 million players. 25% of that would be 2,500,000 players at launch. 1% would be 100,000 players at launch. 
---
What if it was "more epic" to have more competitive players? People keeping their private server info/experience to themselves is just going to cause more blowouts than otherwise. I don't think watching a premade roll over a pug is very interesting, premade vs premade on the other hand...
---
It was ICC. It was delayed, so they threw out ToC real fast.
---
My main goal in classic is to progress raids with our favorite builds and not focus on meta gaming. 
---
I love the little notes attached it really brings the feelings of exploring these zones for the first time back.
---
&gt;For the people who have nerded private servers for years, you have a responsibility to somewhat contain yourself about the teaching and guiding.
---
Nah.
---
&gt;Guilds figuring stuff out on their own and having their own style is a lot more fun!
---
Perhaps for you. Other people like different things.
---
Man, so many people really thought that WOTLK was the best version of WoW. It really made me stop playing the game altogether. Classic is king, imo ;)
---
No 100 million people have made accounts since wow's inception, vanilla had the lowest sub numbers anyways, it skyrocketed in Wrath. 
---
I totally get what you're saying, I just have a more cynical or perhaps pessimistic view.  In an Ideal World they would understand why classic is doing so well and they would modify the modern game to appeal to those aspects once again, but considering it's not blizzard anymore it's Activision Blizzard and they are not the same company as they used to be I really don't think that's going to happen I'm sorry. At this point I've just lowered my expectations and I'm not even that excited for classic because I don't know if it'll ruin it or not. Sure there's a chance they will turn around and start designing differently but I would not count on it. Hell, if you notice they've even admitted that what makes classic appealing and special is the community aspect and socialization and they've even said why sharding is bad for that. So if they have that knowledge then how come they don't use the same logic for modern wow? Because it's not the same game and it's not appealing to the same people with the same goals.
---
Activision could lose Blizzard right now and it would change nothing. They were already destroying their community since Wrath. 
---
Lot of allies in here... (yes yes, SW is grand and all).
---
Org warlock trainer (and by extension; rogue trainer) is kinda cool. Down into the caverns below, tucked away by the mouth of Ragefire Chasm sporting a purple glow. 
---
Activision will never lose Blizzard though
---
You mean like everyone else bashing retail? Unfortunately we live in a time where nobody can enjoy anything and place blame on everyone but themselves. Everyone is going to look at each iteration of WoW with rose tinted glasses which will affect their outlook on the game as a whole. Some people prefer retail to classic, I personally rank classic below multiple expacs being wrath and TBC which were massively superior in every conceivable way. That's not going to stop people from bitching and complaining about why the game isn't the way it used to be. 
---
Even Nost wasn't 100% blizzlike, and it didn't come close to active retail players during Legion. 
---
Of course not, but ****IF**** they did, it wouldn't change a thing. It would probably get worse. 
---
Trollololol
---
100 million? 
---
wasn't it 1 billion? or 6 trillion? 
---
last I checked the subs peaked at 70 quadrillion subs 
---

I was so bad I use to keyboard turn and jump around mobs trying to get them to “miss” me on pve lol
---
That is a good point, but I dont think it quite works like that. The correlation between players getting spoon fed information that would have been semi hard to obtain otherwise, and the increase in competitive players. I dont think these two and linked very much at all, as competitive players would have figured out stuff anyway. I think guides and stuff have more of an impact on the game as whole, how interesting it is for x amount of time. The faster people learn "everything", the faster it will "die".
---
There are many good online games today as opposed to back then and tons of them are free  
---
most people don't want to pay for subscription (*one* of the reasons wow sub has been going down steadily) in age where you can play great games for free  
---
There will be a ton of people that's for sure, but lower expectations, sub game can't compete with LoL or Fortnite  
---
if classic was f2p then perhaps  
---
Refuting objective information isn't a smart thing to do. 
---
Too bad they never did anything w ghost. 
---
R.i.p ghosts
---
I think the history of WoW supports my position, the game was best when it was hard to learn things and know what to do all the time. When raided Gruul's Lair for the first time, and figuring out the maulgar fight, it was one of the most fun and memorable moments for me, that goes for many other bosses aswell, and I dont know any of my wow friends who doesnt agree with this. If I was able to go and watch a guide on Lady Vashj in TBC retail when my guild was progressing on it, it would be very much more boring.
---
If you like to be hand held through everything thats fine, I just dont think WoW history agrees with that approach being good for the game.
---
Yes, 100 million players have made accounts since WoW's inception. 
---
Classic World of Warcraft is being released. a fraction of those 100 million players that are still aware of the existence World of Warcraft and interested in Classic will return to the game. 
---
Vanilla World of Warcraft and Wrath of the Lich King did NOT have 100 million previous players that left the game based on changes. 
---
And let's not forget the easy leveling. Nerfs everywhere and removal of elite mobs.
---
Don't even get me started on the easy epic gear and deprecation of old content. 
---
I really wish they never continue to TBC. All that is good in it (which tbh are Vanilla features transposed to Outland) does not outweight what would be lost. 
---
F
---
Even if everyone collectively forgot everything about vanilla and all the information online about it was magically deleted Classic would still not be the same experience as vanilla; most people play video games differently now.
---
Soon ™
---
&gt;100 million lost subs? Where are you making up these numbers from??
---
Didn't you know 31 BILLION people played wow at some point???
---
Although you are absolutely correct in sating that a subscription based game would never reach the heights of League of Legends or Fortnite if this were a natural emergence of a brand new game; as stated, 100,000,000 previous players, a large percentage of whom paid a subscription fee at some point in the past, may do so again in 2019. 
---
For a subscription based game, Classic World of Warcraft will be dis-proportionally successful if it remains true to the original game. 
---
Based on absolutely nothing at all I’m going to say March, but don’t take it as gospel.
---
Keep dreaming. I have no doubts Classic will do well. Even exceptionally well. However, it's not a "resurrection of gigantic supernatural proportions." That's just not going to happen. 
---
Aye, but it is still an execute style attack regardless. 
---
You have no objective proof to state otherwise. 
---
100k players sounds like it's possible. 100k *returning players*, that's a different story. Time will tell, but in the meantime, please stop sucking vanilla's dick so much. It's one thing to like a game and be excited for its release, but some of you guys are just crazy. Also please stop flinging numbers out of your ass. You have no idea what percentage of the old wow playerbase will return. I have no idea either. Let's not throw random percentages and numbers to try to make a weird point that makes no sense.
---
Maybe Classic will be the OSRS of blizzard. Maybe it won't. We'll see. Next time you feel like sharing your stupid thoughts with the world, think about it for a second first and consider that they might be really, really dumb and that no one actually cares about butthole digging, numbers flinging dumbasses. 
---
100m people is not vanilla only, its throughout wow's history  
---
and its accounts made, not players, very big difference  
---
game was very hype for many years so many people tried it for a very brief time   
---
the reason classic will be financially successful is because past porting it to new tech, they don't have to make anything   
---
free money for blizzard  
---
I know its not Vanilla but the blood knight area is one of the coolest for sure.
---
Yeah they are.
---
It's a little late in the evening to get out the crystal ball. 
---
In 1v1 maybe, but in a group situation viper sting and ranged harrassment make a warlock's life misery. Fear and seduction are a pain in the ass though.
---
I agree with the "Blizzard doesn't exist anymore" sentiment.
---
But even someone who didn't care about videogames in the slightest seeing the disproportional release numbers for Classic and the natural hype generated from Classic with little hard investment of capital is bound to raise some corporate eyebrows. 
---
In my opinion, when observing that Classic is naturally generating hype and naturally growing and naturally hitting targets then many elements from classic will be transplanted into BFA for experimentation to see if that success is transferable.
---
Blizzard would likely transform BFA (or the expansion after) into a weird Hybrid of Classic meets the current game whilst experimenting. 
---
Truly, I don't see it happening, but I hope you're right.  If anything, as long as we can get good and faithful classic servers, and even TBC servers, I'll ne happy because I can always go play those.  But it would be nice for the main game to be good again.  I just think we're too far gone.
---
It steadilly climbed through vanilla, tbc, and wrath, then steadily falled from late wrath onwards, there was no skyrocketing.
---
I stated clearly that in a worst case scenario where a tiny impossible 0.25% of the previous overall playerbase returned to the game; Classic would have 100k active players. 
---
This was the worst of worst case scenarios. 0.25% is very small, when 10% or even 30-40% could happen.  
---
I refuse to reply to the rest of your comment since you resorted to ad hominem's when presented with objective facts. 
---
I think your numbers are way off. I'd expect about a million in classic at most, and I honestly don't know how accurate that prediction is because it's really hard to gauge.
---
It will be like it has always been. Some people will casually play and don’t want to look for any guides or info, some people will tryhard use any info they can get and most people will be in between. The only difference is that more info is out there this time arround.
---
Now for raiding this will ofcourse be a big deal. The perfect strats are available online in a quality way.
---
People will or won't choose to learn things for themselves regardless of how many guides are posted here.
---
Surely you're not implying a Player and account don't have a 1:1 relationship as this would break the terms of service.
---
Secondly, yes, let me state the point a second time. Over the entirety of WoW's history 100,000,000 players have left the game. Although the reasons may be numerous, including things like death or these being trial accounts, or bots, even if 75% of those accounts were excluded, 25% of 25,000,000 players is still 250,000 players on launch day. 
---
Close your eyes, turn the volume down.
---
March-April seems realistic
---
Somewhere before launch, I'd imagine.
---
He cant win with facc; so he chooses to attacc
---
Mages are more convenient to play but especially on alliance there will be more of them; however, what matters more is which class you enjoy playing because warlocks have a playstyle which you'll likely either love or hate.
---
Just find a guild thay accepts your behaviour and go nuts in discord :p
---
&gt;Surely you're not implying a Player and account don't have a 1:1 relationship as this would break the terms of service  
---
Multiboxers, trial accounts, banned accounts, other region accounts, multiple accounts same person  
---
nothing in tos prohibits any of these   
---
I believe there will be way more than 250k concurrent
---
I would say above a million. So many streamers will be promoting it (biggest ones), its given.  
---
But I also think that most of the people that try it will be retail players.  
---
Judging by the comments on all the guides I've watched, I'm getting impression that all these guides are watched by the same group of people who already know pretty much everything there is to know on the subject of a guide but who just want to check if guide's author's knowledge match their own. 
---
Its intentional. To keep the subs rolling through the dark times of BFA. They will time it so the launch of classic is between content patches for BFA, after the initial hype A LOT will quit classic, and then they bring new content for BFA to keep them going.
---
I highly doubt more than 200-300k players will keep playing classic after the initial 1-2 months. But that should be fine, as long as we dont have deserted servers, even 10k people is enough for me:P
---
That is a strawman. No on ever said anything about having the same experience as vanilla, that is impossible indeed. Im talking about what I wrote in my post, not that.
---
Well, we know for certain that: Shroud, Lirik, Sodapoppin, MitchJones, Asmongold and numerous other large streamers will be playing the game on launch day for many many hours. 
---
This is a large enough push to send Classic over the edge in terms of appeal and hype. 
---
I remember mere hours before Cataclysm launched I decided to do one last LFD group just to give Wrath the AoE slaughter fest sendoff I felt it deserved since I knew Cata dungeons would actually be hard as hell again. I queued on my DK tank in top-end ICC gear, waited about ten seconds, and got my random heroic LFD - it was Violet Hold, the one dungeon you *couldn't* AoE steamroll sprint all the way to the end.
---
Well I didn't want to be a dick and bail so i figured what the hell, grind it out, then do another. After the second trash pull the shaman healer lay down to take a nap in the middle of the room since I wasn't taking any damage at all. I said in party chat "too easy, taking pants off" and proceeded to take off my pants and tank. The shaman didn't bother to wake up because I still wasn't taking damage. A couple trash pulls later I said "still too easy, tanking naked" and took off every piece of equipment I couldn't hide. I was wearing helm and cloak, both hidden, my rings, amulet, weapon, trinkets, and whatever death knights used in their "wand" slot. An icon? I dunno, whatever it was. The shaman stood up but still, no damage so he went back to sleep.
---
At this point the troll hunter had done the same and was DPSing naked, followed by a rogue who did the same. Then the heals, though now instead of sleeping he was dancing naked in the middle of the room. We cleared the rest of the place with zero effort with everyone naked. It occurred to me that our stats, just from the pieces we still had on, were much higher than the combined stats of all items worn by someone who would be just starting heroics. That's how crazy the power creep was over the course of Wrath. I didn't bother to queue for another dungeon, I felt that was an appropriate enough sendoff.
---
I continued to play WoW after that, and though Cataclysm was a big ball of shit with a few bright spots, I really enjoyed Pandaria. I had more characters at max level during Mists than I had in any expansion before or since. But after Mists the game just took a nose dive straight into the shitter. WoD was a complete shitshow, Legion was a big better but it still wasn't good. And BfA is just a complete pile of feces, I quit just before it launched and have had no desire to return.
---
At least I'll always have the fond memory of the naked heroic Voilet Hold run.
---
I can agree to that, but It wont stay that way once Classic is released.
---
?
---
Mining is better early, herbalism is better later.
---
Mining gives arcane crystals, which turn into arcanite, which all the new warriors need a bunch of (for arcanite reaper and other gear) 
---
Herbalism gives black lotus, which are used for flasks which are not really needed for MC/Ony, so the demand goes way up once BWL comes out.
---
Thats kind of a cheap point I think, over time it will make a pretty big difference.
---
[Sunken Temple](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=8257)
---
Actually I dont think "info is out there" as much as people think. Its starting to build up now, because of the last year or so. But Classic is a game with so much depth that there is a lot of info that is just not out there as much as people think, hence my post to tell people not to make it so.
---
From what ive researched/seen black lotus aint really a thing, i mean its really hard to get, heavily camped and so on, sadly i wont have the time to compete into that.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer,very usefull, so you would say for the epic mount gold grind mining is a better choice yes?
---
( I was kinda thinking the same, also taking into account the fact that for the initial launch content we dont have bgs so i think the pvp potions/elixirs etc, will have much less demand?maybe)
---
I don't think Ensidia was #1 anymore when Kungen quit, Paragon had taken over already, and i think even Method had already passed them.
---
I you mean that Kungen was the best tank in the world, i think thats highly debateable also, maybe he will become relevant again in Classic, but on his various streams he was making so many mistakes that its hard to regard him as "best tank".   
---
doesn't seem to actually be there though. 
---
I played horde mostly during wrath. A tiny bit before cataclysm, I started the human that became my main. For stupid reasons, I was not able to level in elwynn... So I did so in dun morough, got to 15, and used dungeon finder to get to max level.
---
One of the first things I want to do is something stupid I never had a chance to do in the original game: get ganked by hogger.
---
also the level is 40 which doesnt make sense for being in ST.
---
On the other hand, vanilla guilds occasionally brought people to MC before they were even level capped
---
I think so. It's hard to know what's going to happen with lotus, on private servers there was some camping until they added more spawns. There was also 10k+ pop, which I'm not expecting for blizzard classic. 
---
Certainly arcane crystals are more reliable - you will get a few every hour but they are \~10% of the price of a lotus, which you will get every few hours.
---
There is also the flipside, that thorium tends to be worth almost nothing while dreamfoil/icecap/plaguebloom/gromsblood/ghost mushrooms all have decent value.
---
Is it the one from the bag that drops from trolls in the Hinterlands? Ooze covered bag I believe?
---
I don’t get all this talk about people being shit in the past. Yes a 8 year old was probably as bad in 2005 as they are in 2019, but a normal player in 2005 vs a normal player in 2019? Why would there be a difference?
---
It’s not like SpawN, HeatoN, elemenT and other legends of Counterstrike were shit compared to today’s CS:GO standards. So why would the same be true with World of Warcraft?
---
Sure with time we get more theorycrafting and we might figure out some new things. But that’s hardly the definition of player skill. 
---
Personally, I leveled as a Fire mage back then. That was probably not as efficient as doing Frost. With that aside I cannot come up with any other weird thing I might have done. 
---
While this sub loves to complain, there are a number of strong critiques.
---
Class abilities have been heavily homogenized and pruned. The writing feels subpar &amp; "power levels" are crazy high. Server communities are relics due to automated cross-realm group finders, artificially splitting larger local gatherings of players (sharding), and name/realm swaps.... Legion (2016-2018) was well received, but the current expansion is quite loathed.
---
Thats is great, but Hunter is still so much easier to solo
---
I selected a Druid, a mage what can heal, it must be a great combo, and did run around, cast spells on mobs and hit them using my staff. 
---
Did hate the gut out of bear from becuse it did change the camera angle, it did give me a light vertigo then runing in bear from, so I barely used the bear from.  
---
Then peopel start to wisper me, do you want to come to a dungeon, me sure, next question was can you heal, yes druid can heal, and then I start to DPS the mobs, and peoplel did say do not attack the mops, I was totaly confused, did not understand the Tank/Healer/DPS configuration.
---
Did change to a real mage, and I did hate it then I was interrupted/stuned by all enemy rogues that I did try to burning them to ash, yes I did try to PVP as a fire mage. 
---
Then I did change to a Warlock, they have dots, they cant be interuppted, was so proud of myself then I did curse of exhaustion the evil rogues and kit them to death.
---
I have found my call as a alliance Warlock, it was easy mod, and I become slayer of Onyxia, banisher of Ragnaros, crushers of Nefarian, the doom of the Twin Emperors, the killer of Anub'Rekhan.   
---
Now in reflection I cant understand that I did not understand consumable, and still raided at that level, why have that? I can lifetap to get mana, and I have healthstone insted of healt-pots. But atlest all my gear was proper enchanted. 
---
Then I did have some evil addon in PVP, as long you did press the button repeated it automatically dot all enemies within reach, in my full BWL gear, I could in principle break a enemy attack alone in Arathi Basin, by using the addon and runing/jumping aroudn.
---
It does make sense. They are just trash mobs that are easily handled. The level span in vanilla can be huge. See Mauraudon or Uldaman for example. Or even BRD.
---
&gt; I played a balance Druid.
---
You to? 
---
That was 12 year old me!
---
If you want a bit more realistic gauge, just look at the Reddit subscriber numbers for r/classicwow compared to r/wow 50 thousands vs. 920 thousands.
---
Of course not everyone who'll roll on a Classic server is subscribed to r/classicwow. But not everyone who is playing WoW is subscribed to r/wow either. But at these kind of numbers, it's quite a good indicator. Certainly much better than your "100 MILLION!!" number (which is the number of accounts created? certainly not the actual interest in the game right now...).
---
So I predict that around 5% of WoW's user base number of people will have a serious interest in Classic. This doesn't mean 5% of current players as most people interested in Classic don't currently play the game. (There was a poll, which wasn't scientific but for ballpark figures we can use it. Around 70% responding didn't play WoW currently.)
---
This of course doesn't count "tourists" but those will only come from the current player base. Blizzard will certainly won't do a big advertisement push. :) (I don't see them doing any kind of advertisement, apart from their regular channels for announcing stuff, which will not reach those who currently don't play.)
---
So, all counted, I think there will be around 100 thousand Classic players and around 900 thousand additional tourists (I presume 2M current players). The tourists will mostly leave (even if they don't like BfA, they'll like Classic even less). Of course the number of current WoW players is a very rough guess. But in the end I don't expect more than a few hundred thousand Classic players, even if I'm very optimistic. Classic will have a very healthy player base. More than most MMOs, actually. But it won't change anything in the gaming landscape. :)
---
There can always be more info out there sure. But for now there are optimal guides for:
---
- all quests
---
- Speed lvling 
---
- class builds for all situations
---
- gear and BiS pre/post raid for every class
---
- all raidbosses
---
- professions
---
- skill rotations 
---
- ...
---
So I kinda disagree. For 95% of progression           -relevant- content there can be information found.
---
I think it’s the wrong way to ask people not to put information out there for something their passionate about. That never works. We got the information out there and everyone nowu has the freedom to decide for themself if they want to use it.
---
I never had a massive issue farming Black Lotus for flasks. Sure it was rare, but once you knew most of the spawns for it, you could get some. I never saw many people camping spawns on my server at all.
---
I was gonna say that by the floor style 
---
IIRC, they announced the BfA release date around march last year (pls correct me if I'm wrong). So march/april seems like the right time. 
---
Nah, blizz is a goddamn mess right now.  
---
  They will find a way to fuck it up like they've ruined all their other games recently, for classic to come out, be well done and maintain a good number of people it would take modern blizz to basically abandon all the things they've done to self sabotage super quickly, a full 180 in a short time span.  
---
  I can't be optimistic about this when every single other part of the company is on fire, there's basically no way it doesn't spreads.  
---
Mages are great in many perspectives, but yes you are right that they are kind of boring in PvE. All you do is Frostbolt, Polymorph and you are also one of the few classes that can provide AoE in raids. 
---
So if you want to be one of the most sought after DPS classes, wreck people in PvP and be on top of the DPS meters then go ahead, but if you want to feel challenged and require focus and responsibility then maybe it’s not the right class for you. 
---
I'd say herbalism, but that really xomes down to either heading off to WS or Azsh and farming MSS, or getting your hands on Black Lotus. Mining nets you thorium and arcane crystals and while they're reliable income they're not as lucrative.
---
Selling Tank-Heal duo service
---
I left retail for GW2 for these reasons. It’s nice being able to take a break for a year and have a bunch of content to play when I get back but still have completely viable gear.
---
Yeah the Gold solution is horrible, money in Vanilla means a lot.
---
100 G is not some spare change you can throw out.
---
Tell me one Item that would need to be bound.
---
&gt; the area from the Purple exit of Maraudon to the Portal entrance of Maraudon
---
I'm lost already.
---
Holy shit you're such a fucking baby this is why people think retail players are idiots
---
Yeah, we just /wave'd at eachother in Moonglade or in the open world. Was pretty awesome, felt like seeing buddies in Moonglade when leveling up. 
---
&gt; I don't think you understand what you're advocating for.
---
I get that you think that. However I understand it better than you.
---
&gt; The only way to normalize the difference is to take the retail route and squish all stats to the point where they mean nothing and everybody ends up losing.
---
You are just making the perfect the enemy of the good. There are lots of ways to hamper twinkers without harming any normal levellers. Limiting enchants to appropriately levelled gear takes nothing away from anyone except twinkers, for example. Giving a tiny amount of xp from battlegrounds, and giving people the option of locking their xp in exchange for being quarantined into a twink PvP division takes nothing away from anyone except twinkers.
---
&gt; If someone doesn't have the social skills to participate in endgame with people who fight back and instead wants to sit in a queue for hours just to annihilate the same helpless baby deer, who am I to tell them they can't.
---
If the only defence you can think of for bad behaviour is "who am I to *say* it is bad behaviour"? you are admitting there is no defence for it.
---
Gearscore is a player made issue though. 
---
Sharding wasn't in Wrath, Phasing was, but that was only a issue during leveling mostly, as phasing only kicks in if one player is more progressed on quests than the other. 
---
No I love tbc.
---
Fight me. 
---
Doubtful... if the company split the publically traded stock would also. The split would most likely reduce the value of the stock. This could give the more control to a CEO to make better decisions more align with players wants, rather than just please share holders. But you could be right and they could still tank it, they would just have a better chance to redeme themselves.
---
Loved that park. It made Stormwind feel more welcoming to the other races of the alliance rather than the human-centered stuff we got in later expansions. I kept hoping they'd put in some more NPCs and make it a place for Draenei and Gilneans as well, instead they leveled the place. :(
---
If Classic really does take off, I dont find it inconcievable that Blizzard goes  completely off the wagon with retail.
---
Having placated all the people that liked the old wow better, why bother trying to make retail anything like it ever again?

It spawns from a larger, saturated ooze. They are around the top circle where you activate the pillars. 
---
Market for arcane crystals tanks somewhere around late bwl, and none of the other ore is worth shit.
---
Lotus is a far more lucrative farm, and most of the other high end herbs are actually worth money even if you're unlucky.
---
Probably will get downvoted, but for me as a casual i cant justify 15 bucks a month to maybe play an hour or two some months. Sure i will play 5-10h some days but most of the time it will be just an hour here and there. Would rather have a pay by the hours system.
---
I played a mage and didn't have any +damage gear until well after I hit 60 because I thought it meant how much +damage monsters inflicted on me.
---
chicken
---
Rogue for sure
---
1. Nobody cares about gear that is going to have an xmog applied over it.
---
1. The only way to make something interesting is unique spell effects, animations, summons
---
1. The 30 item level jump in tiers is a result of heroic and mythic difficulty. The jump in item level between difficulty settings must feel significant otherwise you run into problems of people feeling that it's not worth running the new content and would rather run heroic Uldir than Normal Daz'alor. 
---
 Mythic Antorus dropped item level 250 gear and at 120 dungeon blues are around item level 300-320. So even this gap isn't that significant between expansions.
---
1. The gem slot bonus goes against what is being said. It was convoluted to figure out whether putting the right gem color in it was better. It's convoluted to know whether a lower item level boot with a gem slot was better than another pair. Yeah it goes back to the same thing as now. Sim the best option. The sim can do the calculations for you.

1. There should be clarity in what secondary stats are good for your spec.
---
1. Getting people to fixate on one M+ dungeon for an item might be a good thing as they might learn the dungeon better.
---
1. The game needs unified loot names. A pair of item level 385 boots with a specific name should drop from multiple places like M+, raiding etc.
---
1. I don't think going back to tank gear and DPS gear is a good thing.
---
I always feel a bit sad for flying mounts with the hate they receive.
---
 I totally get how in practice they did kill a large part of the game, however unlike lfr and lots of the other features which we hate for catering to casuals, flying mounts were actually a really awesome thing that blizzard tried to give us. It just didn't quite go to plan. 
---
&gt;We are looking at a revival, a Resurrection of gigantic supernatural proportions here
---
Maybe. Or it might be a dead cat bounce. Time will tell.
---
I know I’m late, but I want to say I completely agree with where you’re coming from with the dungeons aspect. I’m gonna be honest, I didn’t come early. I was born 2001 and started playing at MoP, so when I started it already had queuing.
---
That’s what put me off to the game, and why it’s so hard to find an MMO that is “more serious”. Deaths actually have a consequence, requires skill to beat bosses/raids/World bosses, max leveling doesn’t take &lt;10 hours, and no god damn insta ques for dungeons and raids.
---
Well not really, that's assuming they have to come up with their own ideas. They can literally copy BC and wrath patches with zero effort and have a clear path to go forward. That's still a good while before they have to make decisions on it 
---
Bitch
---
Make a Pvp video with the class I decide to main (I have 0 idea and have played all at lv 60)
---
they already reached 100 million accounts at the end of 2013. See http://media.wow-europe.com/infographic/en/world-of-warcraft-infographic.html
---
And out of Vanilla, TBC and Wrath actually actually had the lowest gains in subscriber numbers. Only going from around +- 11 million to +-12 million at the end of Wrath. Subscriber growth in Wrath was mostly a flat line. 
---
I see. Well i just try to decide on this for the initial gold farm (epic mount beeing the big one obviously), most likely ill switch the profession out with something else once i have that covered. So till BWL is released hopefully i wont need it anymore. Would you still consider herbalism a better choice?
---
A company needs stable and predictable income to continue maintaining its services. Pay by the hour sounds like a very bad idea.
---
ahh, thanks for the info!
---
I loved GW2, but it took horizontal progression a bit too seriously for my tastes. To the point where it barely felt like there was any progression beyond cosmetic. 
---
I'd say a good aim would be a 15% power increase in gear from new raids, always based on the original, in Classic's case, MC. So in that case, even after 10 raids, you're just 150% stronger. After a hundred raids you're 1,500% stronger, but that's still not enough to solo MC, not even close. 
---
I see, makes sense that they spawn from other oozes. thanks!
---
U should consider skinning too if you want it as fast as possible, devilsaur is very needed early on and is worth a ton
---
its really not a big deal. having cloth doesnt matter in raids its pvp and you get a seperate set for pvp that is plate and has stam 
---
The trash started with WOTLK. BC and Vanilla for life.
---
a really good point.  my favourite solo play time was using the (raid) gear I obtained with the standard min-max build in other situations trying out all kinds of crazy talent builds.    I collected all kinds of niche raid gear that usually would get disenchanted for this. 
---
Always felt like Hunters got a little shafted in this respect - thrown in next to the Battlemasters in IF, some weird little tower arrangement in Org/Darny/TB.
---
I like to think it's probably a reflection of the class fantasy though - Hunters don't have a permanent home, they're just passing through to grab supplies or a nights sleep before heading back out again. Their home is outside in the wilds, not in a city.
---
Even when they added class halls into Legion (which in concept are a cool idea) the Trueshot Lodge was just that - a Lodge in a secluded grove on a mountainside. Sure it was cosy, but it never felt like a home - just a place to rest before you head back out again.
---
Agreed. If I knew that every hour I played was money drawn from my bank account it would be a constant stress on my mind. Having a flat monthly sub is the best option.
---
I think devilsaurs will be overfarmed and heavily camped on any decent pop server, and rest of leathers dont really sell for anything :(
---
In dungeons with low tps gear. Maybe? But if we are talking about naxx content. Dodging bosses attacks is huge when it comes to raid sustain. Imagine dodging patchwork’s 6k attack. 
---
The later in the game you go. The better night elf tanks are. With shit gear your better off with humans because they will generate more threat. 
---
And because night elves have a higher chance to dodge, they have an easier time respecting to flury spec which gives higher tps. Due to the fact that they won’t become as squishy compared to humans.
---
i think you overeact when you say that :D You need to remember a few things - Pop will be lower then private server - People will be less knowledgeable then on private servers about what is worth a lot 
---
Atleast my plan as a rogue is going skinning/enchanting and then later removing skinning and taking engingering instead :p 
---
But i guess rogues are better at farming devilsaur too
---
Many companies including Blizzard work with pay by the hour or similar models without a problem, loot boxes in Overwatch for example. They never know how many they are going to sell every month, yet they continue to develop free heroes and maps. After a short while you can predict income. Its not like Blizzard at the end of the month will have to shut down because low income.
---
If thats the big issue you could just have a minimum of lets say 100 hours that you can buy and spend as you please. Sounds like a better idea now?
---
Have both?
---
Epic
---
You can't go wrong with either.
---
Yeah and I think gw2 took away class identity too much as well. Post HoT there was a great moment where some classes were excellent at condi, some were excellent at booms, etc. Now every class can do everything which is great if you have one character that you play exclusively, but bad for class identity imo.
---
I agree that they needed a bit more progression, however now they are on the right path with progression tracks for raids, fractals, etc. GW2 would also benefit from leveraging wvw better, which they are finally doing by adding in real gear progression outside of pve.
---
Most people here grew up with TBC and Wotlk, that's a blessing
---
Spot on. After Ulduar, things declined rapidly. It was at this moment i stopped putting an effort into the game.
---
if you have enough disposable income, yes  
---
if you don't, no  
---
simple as that  
---
You don’t want loot boxes or something similar to keep Classic going. Better to not play then.
---
For the Alliance!
---
I was a clicker until Wotlk :/
---
There will never be 10kk players in Classic, even at launch. That's just not realistic. 2kk maybe at max, but that will drop to a quarter after a month or two.
---
LFD came out with the ICC 5-mans.
---
MIddle of spring.
---
I dont know yet :/
---
I have always played alliance, so I was thinking about going horde now to get a whole new experience. But I feel like horde doesnt suit me. At the same time I am worried that the horde numbers will be lower than the alliance, mostly because I am thinking about going for a pve server. So I would have to switch to a pvp server to get a better chance of some big horde numbers, which isnt the worst thing. I also wanted to roll a paladin, but my choice has already changed like 5 times in the span of 4 weeks.
---
So, please, what should I do? Make the case for either horde or ally ;)
---
One of the best parts of Riposte is that disarms don't have DRs in Classic, so you can lock down meleers' offense in PVP for a surprisingly long time if you're lucky.
---
Except retail WoW has a sub + box cost + expansion cost + cash shop, selling gold, cosmetics, super expensive characer services etc
---
A sub didn't prevent Blizzard from adding any of that.
---
If they get reworked into the new api for classic, not sure how much the code will change
---
Played a shaman, I remember he was LW and when I reached 40 and started wearing mail, spent a bunch of time chain killing turtles on the coast in Onyxia's zone (dont remember the english name sorry!) until I could craft full turtle set, was so proud of it!
---
Replaced it right after with SM drops :D
---
Neither do you, you pulled 100 million out of thin air
---
I have no idea where you read that i want loot boxes. Could you point out so i can clarify?
---
you don't have to. you choose to.
---
in PvE it doesn't matter and for PvP you get your free PvP tier sets. 
---
Oh, it's risen allright
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/) is a more in-depth survey that also covered faction preferences. 
---
Yeah or just solve the real problem there and merge realms. Its really that simple.
---
actually flying mounts were completely fine in tbc. You still had world pvp at resource farming locations, world pvp areas, daily quest areas. The only thing you lose with flying was ganking on the road, which, lets be honest here, is the least impactful wpvp, and was rare in vanilla as well... On the other hand there were some cool locations that you could only reach/was optimized for flying. If anything it was flying done well. It is funny how history is rewritten, because back then nobody hated it, and it was a cool feature. I think it was like cata/mop maybe that it started to get hate.
---
I started really bad, having only really played rts games and stuff like that before. I did improve quite a lot through my time in the game though, could fairly comfortably tank dungeons towards the end of vanilla. Never really got to end game though, BC came around when I got to 60. 
---
Not sure when I stopped keyboard turning and clicking on spells. But definitely started out like that. Also remember what you mentioned on one of my first characters, would only look at armor value, not what stats it had because I didn't really know what they did. Think I read through the game manual at some point though (when the family computer was taken) and figured stuff like that out. 
---
&gt;  instead of engaging with people to form a group hurt the game almost as much as arenas
---
OK, i get it you don't like arenas, and I understand the argument against arenas, but you must be exaggerating to say they are somehow worse than dungeon finder???
---
Yepp, made me rage when they nerfed them 4.0.6 i think. and 4.2 was just as bad if not worse. 
---
If only cata didnt put flying in Azeroth and used attunements and nerf alot of class identity and remove so much content from the game, Cata would have been amazing with its amazing PvP and PvE content and interesting spells. I played through Cata and even i forgot how many spells there are in Cata.
---
Firstly, that's not a solution for dodging in any capacity.
---
Secondly, in terms of arenas and/or battlegrounds which are purely instanced content, what is the difference between having a batrlegroup and having just one server besides making it easier to dodge?
---
Thirdly and perhaps most importantly. This would not have happened on "dead" servers only. It happens on highly populated private servers too for vanilla. Before AV comes out, what happens is you have one premade team on each faction which dominates. They go on discord and they dodge each other. The result is that if you pug or if you have an inferior premade, you will get matched against the dominant ones 90%+ of the time. People don't like the feeling of getting wrecked over and over, so they stop queuing.
---
Batrlegroups made it possible to have player pools larger than even the most popular private servers, and harder to dodge because you can't see when people on other servers are online. At the same time because the content is 100% instanced, and not somewhere out in the world map where you actually go. It detracts nothing to have a larger pool. 
---
Why would you need autoshot on your bars? sorry if im missing something
---
That's not the real problem. Even large realms have rampant dodging which is made easier when you're all on the same server, and even the biggest private servers (which are bigger than any classic retail server ever was) don't have as much population as a Battlegroup does. 
---
You have literally no evidence of this.
---
When I watched a WoW vanilla conference way back in 2005, one design goal they mentioned was "to simplify MMORPG", since the genre deterred many people due to its intricacy at its time (EverQuest for example). Vanilla might be entirely different from modern WoW, but their goal to simplify MMORPG certainly succeeded. 
---
Good luck convincing Activison-Blizzard of that in 2019.
---
im guessing around 700k players if its done right and the hardcore players like it. for example if people play it and hardcores go back to privates because they think it emulates vanilla better then i think the casuals will leave too 
---
I never made it past level 35 because I hated dustwallow marsh with a passion. I just alted a lot, loved the low level experience and the AQ turn ins. And all that was playing with 250-300 ping because Australian servers were located in LA or something
---
I didn't even hit Max level until BC with a 70 BE hunter and even then I only did kara and gruuls. People asked my dps and I just listed the white number in my character pane, I had zero clues. I was a noob until LK because I never really had a guild or mentor to teach me. And then when wrath hit I made a paladin and never looked back. Tanked and healed from ulduar all the way to heroic ICC 25. I love LK and I just want it back to how it was.
---
Super stoked for classic, I've not felt this excited about a game for a long time 
---
Guild Wars 2 is a major example of this. It gets a set of new, often very well made weapon skins every month or so, but instead of having to earn them with ingame means, you get them with tickets from lootboxes. There haven't been any new dungeons since release, and they manage to squeeze out 1/3 of a raid every 9 months.
---
On the other hand, I also think subscriptions are too expensive. Do some maths on how much they made with every subscriber every year in WoW's high times and you'll get ridiculous numbers that are in no relation to the development costs.
---
Yes you are probably right, pop cap will make a big difference and might not be as bad as i think.
---
Just curious why enchanting? From the stuff i read seems a subpar choice unless the dedicated guild enchanter i guess
---
&gt; but a normal player in 2005 vs a normal player in 2019? Why would there be a difference?
---
In WoW, a big difference. Two main reasons. In 2005 no one knew much about the game, no one had really played it for any significant amount of time. In 2019 the "normal" WoW player has played the game for years already. There is also a general difference in access to information. The average player in 2005 would not be looking at videos of other people playing the game, listen to what others were saying outside the game on the internet, and would not look up guides how to play their class or boss strategies or stuff like that. The internet was much more primitive back then, while that information did exist in some shape on forums and such, most people didn't look for it. 
---
Nowadays it's normal to be looking up class guides and stuff on icy-veins for example, or look up or even simulate what the best stats are for you, stuff like that. A whole lot of people also watch youtube videos or streams of better players, and catch up a lot of stuff that way. 
---
That movie is completely changed in a Theater experience 
---
 "But SSC and TK were phased out pretty much the moment they removed the attunements, and those were removed fairly quickly."
---
What? Removing the attunements to enter didn't phase them out. I'd say it rather increased participation, there was nothing to skip ahead to anyway.
---
And BT/Hyjal attunement wasn't removed until 2.4
---
My first character was a holy paladin and I leveled  to 44 in all cloth gear. To be fair though I never got complaints about my healing although I got a few questions as to why I was wearing a dress lol. I also clicked all my spells and I did not fully boot that habit until Cata😞 
---
It's the logical consequence of maximizing profits, and it works only because there are motherfuckers out there daft enough to pay for stupid cash shop shit.
---
Do we usually have a confirmed release date before beta hits or does it come later?
---
Pretty cool idea! It'd be a bit of a hacky thing to implement though, as there's nothing exposed to APIs that allows you to identify one item from another. So the addon would have to keep track of which bag slot correlates to which shard, and attempt to track the shards through any bag operations, which may or may not always be possible.
---
lmao what makes u think classic will only have \~nostalrius playerbase????
---
My goal is to try be one of the few enchanters with all the recipes, if you are that you actually get a big profit (if a lot of people add you to friend list cause u are "the enchanter with everything"
---
Warlock is pretty simple. People like pets and dots
---
That's counting every trial account, farmer, spammer and person who quit after one month, I believe. It's not anything like the number of people who ever played WoW seriously enough to be likely to come back.
---
My guess is Classic will see tens of thousands of pirate server players, and hundreds of thousands or maybe one or two million returning players or current retail players who decide to stay.
---
The people who post here are an unrepresentative minority of serious fans. There's simply no way that the bulk of people who ever played WoW are as enthusiastic about Classic as the people here are, and I think the idea that ten million people might seriously play Classic is wishful thinking. I'd be very happy to see it, but I do not think it will happen.
---
100 million accounts created is a statistic you can google?
---
It drops from most high level oozes. I got one feralas randomly without knowing it even dropped at that time.
---
dont talk with this guy lmao. "100k player sounds like its posssible" thats 75% of nostalrius playerbase hahhahah. classic will have atleast a million at launch
---
I don't understand this logic. The monthly sub should be much more stressful according to your way of thinking since you lose money every hour you don't play.
---
He said 100 million players not accounts. They were giving away accounts left and right with the warcraft movie and plenty just bought cheap accounts for RAF mounts too. It's not an accurate number 
---
&gt; Herbalism gives black lotus
---
Apart from that, herbing also gives, well, all the herbs, which, depending on how active your raiding scene is (and how lazy your raiders), can also add substantially to your wallet.
---
Adding to that: It can also be quite profitable to take up Alchemy for the Transmute (which miners usually do not have, because apart from that, it has absolutely no synergy with it) and certain potions/flasks, and since Alchemy naturally goes well with Herbalism, it tends to be my go-to combo for both a nicely padded wallet and self-sufficiency; Keep in mind that certain recipes in Vanilla are not trivial to come by (e.g. the one for the Major Mana Potion), and that certain classes are a really good pick for herbalism (e.g. rogues or even better druids can solo farm Maraudon for the Ghost Mushrooms, which are an ingredient for Ghost Dye, one of the best healer chest pieces).
---
#Lok'tar Ogar!
---
I miss the time before the major talent system change and before cata changed a bunch of zones. I liked old thousand needles. And actually going to trainers.
---
I started right at the end of vanilla. I was never 60 while 60 was cap. I think I got to 58 just in time for burning crusade release. I thought BC and WotLK were great. 
---
I'm of the same mindset. I love the graphical and technical updates WoW has got over the years, but it's become rather dull in other aspects
---
Ah ok yea thats true, nice :D
---
It is, though 
---
I was ok with the phasing in wrath since it was predictable and you just needed to sync main zone story to be on same phase
---
The huge thing that started ruining the game for me was the talent system change. I miss my trees.
---
In what world were the encounters boring? The Alliance fight was imo one of the best encounters thet have ever done. The Valkyr were highly original, they others were alao good.
---
Although this was from a dps PoV.
---
From what I've read in Asia WoW uses (used?) a pay-by-hour system. Since most people play in internet cafés and the like.
---
At the end of retail vanilla, I was a better WoW player than I am currently. I have improved in some ways though. I have my buffs and my mount keybinded instead of clicking them now (doesn't really make a huge difference though, but it saves a bit of time). 
---
Honestly i expected this to be so much worse. Solid rhymes and solid cringe.
---
I'd kill for a large poster of the classic WoW map.
---
My mindset has always been "15$ is what I'd spend on a boring night out, this game keeps me in the house for more than that". Wouldn't that work for you? 
---
Mad as your rap skills are this has been removed as it is not related to Classic. 
---
I love vanilla but I'd take heroic raids over vanilla raids any day. I want difficulty, anything pre naxx isn't.
---
I don't care much about having flashy looking gear when playing an MMO, so selling cosmetics works fine by me. Especially mounts and pets which I don't care about at all. 
---
I also don't mind WoWs current token system too much either. We have always had gold sellers, so why not make it official and make the company earn money that way instead? Making it possible to pay for you sub with in game gold is a great addition too. 
---
This man gets it!
---
Companies want to keep people playing their games, for as much time as possible. Pay by hour would be horrible, since people would try to minimize their play time.
---
Even from the player's perspective, you pay a flat fee for countless hours of entertainment. I doubt many Netflix subscribers are stressing out about losing money when they're not watching. The customer evaluates if the flat fee is worth it considering the time they put into it, and make the decision to subscribe or not. 
---
Grab your sword and fight the horde!
---
The only thing that kept me going was how stupidly fun it was to play a very well geared enh shaman who stacked haste with all the on hit fist weapon and trinket procs.
---
 Then they changed haste just before I completed full hc 25 icc gear :(
---
* Intended region: EU
---
* Intended server type: PVP or PVE, not decided yet.
---
* Intended faction: Undecided
---
* Intended raid/play times: For me times I will play could vary due to work/school. But in general I will be available in the evening around 19-24 PM CET.
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild: I am mostly looking for a guild that does a bit of everything.
---
I am not a hardcore player. I am mostly looking to play for fun and have a good time while doing so. I played retail from TBC to MOP and couldnt stand the way the game was changing. So when I heard this summer classic wow is coming our way, I got excited again. I have watched dozens of videos about classes, races, leveling, etc. So far I have shifted between classes and horde/alliance about as much as can be. I want to be able to heal dungeons, raids and BGs, but also have the possibility to spec into damage and do those things. Sadly hybrid classes in classic basically means you have to heal or be ok with sub par damage. So I am sort of undecided in my faction and class.
---
I am looking for like minded people who want to play casually and eventually clear some raids aswell. I am open to arguments about which class I should play, which means I could be suited for most groups ;). I would like guildmates to do stuff together. Like question, dungeons, BGs, and in general just help eachother out in any way they realistically can.
---
You guys must be on crack if you think the release date is March/April 
---
Only the flying mounts? 25 men raids vs 40 men raids splintered the community. Arena splintered the community even more. Paladins and shamans available for both factions started the faction identity removal. Easy leveling removed the need for a main (player-character identity) and playing multiple characters. Cheap spec, again, affected character identity. New professions implemented badly, gems and sockets, gold inflation (daily quests with too big gold rewards), no reliable gold sinks, etc. etc.
---
TBC was the expansion who started and implemented the mindset toward smaller, splintered communities and single player game (25 men instead 40, later on in Wrath 10 men raids / MoP with scenarios / arena being more popular than BG's, heroic modes, dailies in Wrath and later being a gold mine, WoD garrisons).
---
All the shit that is in the retail WoW today started in TBC.
---
Where did I say a private, illegal server with 0 advertisement or marketing came close to the population of retail wow? 
---
What I said was it began overtaking retail viewership on twitch, which was the point it got shutdown by blizzard.
---
Blizz let tonnes of private servers exist, they shut down Nost because it was beginning to rival retail in terms of attention. This statement is directly at odds with the post I replied to, since blizzard clearly saw Nostalrius as getting too popular for their liking. 
---
Like I said how can people be this delusional. IF you are looking for someone that is carried and comes from a selfish place, try someone like Towelliee. Former guildmates from Deathjester's (he stole that guild name from Ultima Online btw and he wasn't in the guild) have gone on record saying he's the worst Mythic raider they ever raided with and by far the worst tank and that he is 100 percent carried. The guy is someone that legit would not see a Mythic without help and sits there acting like Mythic raiding the be all end all. Kungen had great parses any time he came back and he is who did strategy in the old raids. **Selfish is not attacking what makes you money. He could have continued getting meaningless world firsts that no one cares about anymore. Btw the reason no on cares anymore is that everyone is on different content.** In old WoW kids, adults, grandma's, grandpa's all did the same content so they were all interested in seeing world first. They could apply strats etc. They could all do the raid if they took the time.
---
You are basically saying Wilt Chamberlain sucks at basketball all because you have been brainwashed by sellout Blizzard influencers like Towelliee. It's actually funny. Why Wilt is an apt comparison? ESPN can't bring him up or stats or Kareem, because they have to sell the current product (Lebron) as the best ever. The only reason they bring up Michael Jordan is he still has current merchandise and a brand bigger than Lebron's. Towelliee is just an unethical salesman so he has to do the same. WoW is awesome NOW, old WoW BAD. I will bet 10,000 dollars that Towelliee attacks Classic with revisionist history by claiming that Tier 1 and 2 are how it was (dumbed down/nerfed) when boss fights were nerfed as will all the unethical streamers whose job is WoW, and you want to attack Kungen as selfish? LOL NO. 1.12 talents make "Classic" tier 1 and 2 a joke, wrong itemization makes it a joke, no spell batching makes it a joke. It's like when Nihilum went into WOTLK and cleared Naxx 25 with like 10 people in the first week...
---
I'm not saying it even matters (unless they accelerate the time frame and then Classic is ruined and 4 patches just might do that), because raiding is not what vanilla is about.
---
Nerf raiding in TBC? The expansion falls apart. Want to know why? Cus it's a bad MMO. Raiding is all it has, just like modern WoW. Brack's WoW is the "rose tinted glasses" and it's sold by unethical people who don't want to get real jobs or be honest with people.
---
Get rank 13 or 14 if i finally play warrior
---
I was in the same boat, I’ll probably go for a 30 hour so I can log off in the 30s, but it’s probably not a big deal anymore cuz of the sharding they plan on doing for the first few zones/weeks or phasing whatever it’s called. Either way what’s worked for me in the past is to just get halfway through STV before I log off then log in and you won’t have any aids to deal with if your quick. 
---
It was the peak because Vanilla and TBC players playing it. If you REALLY look at the numbers, Vanilla was the peak, at 8 million. TBC added only 3 million more and WOTLK added only 1.4 million more. 
---
If I want to play a warlock on classic, and I've never played one (nor anything pre-Legion), should I level one on retail or will it affect my enjoyment do you think? (have much more experience with melee than casters in retail, like 8 to 1).
---
Completely delusional. In raiding you use one button 99 percent of the time on many classes. In PVP on the same class (Mage is a good example) you use the entire spellbook and PvP is harder that modern WoW classes after Celestalon butchered them all in WoD playing WoW on a stencil tablet. 
---
Raiding was meant to be accessible and social. That is the point of old WoW. You are supposed to be able to progress with people you actually like and FRIENDS. Not theorycrafters and abusive people who everyone hated and that they then designed the game around. That is why the WoW community is trash now.  
---
Modern WoW rewards players for leaving friends and family behind, that they are forced to leave behind to progress or even see content. It's the worst game design in history and why subs have fallen. Old WoW locked progression behind gear accumulation that the best players could bypass with consumables and strats to get a few months ahead. Those encounters were never supposed to be beaten quickly by the average player without slow accumulation of gear in that tier. Or be too difficult to clear. Only Naxx forced a ton of consumables because it was the last raid and "beating the game".
---
It's like claiming that playing basketball against toddlers is = to playing against high school kids. There wasn't one nerf to the old raids by then. There was like 10. 
---
Not today. But 10 years ago?
---
They already confirmed the release date its coming out in summer
---
Yikes
---
Oh, I don't mean with players, I mean with NPCs and general in-game things to make it seem like a real lived-in city. 
---
Ironforge certainly had the most players there for me too but Stormwind just felt more like a breathing city and less "gamey". The RP server thing probably helped too though - the players that WERE in Stormwind would often be contributing to the aliveness rather than just shopping at the AH.
---
dont give blizzard money right now game is shit and they dont deserve it
---
Well, it is less stressful because it DOESN'T FORCE you to play. With an hourly payment, every player will be STUCK to the computer for the time he alloted to play.
---
With a monthly fee, I can log anytime I want, do anything I want, including TALKING with other people. On an hourly fee, the players will NOT talk, because they paid to PLAY the game...right?
---
If you are unable to understand that monthly sub based games are superior to ANY other form of payment...you are probably born after 2000.
---
And after Wrath of the Lich King, WoW turned into rubbish and its numbers plummet.
---
I think you are massively overestimating how many people will return. I'd guess 75% of the people who left either dont game at all or wouldnt consider playing an mmo a worthy time investment due to rl constraints. Most of those people are probably proper adults now.
---
Full T2 undead rogue alt with ivory raptor 
---
It was, not for at least 2 years now. Its all monthly sub today.
---
What if WoW ends up being the WoW killer?
---
MT? ToC?
---
To play the game its no big deal in general. However for individual players it can be a big deal as it doesn't line up with their fantasy they want to play. 
---
One of my friends back then actually was a pretty avid role player and a lot of role players didn't really like the fact that to be able to raid optimally on for example paladin or druid they needed to use gear that didn't fit in their RP story at all 
---
&gt; to make people want them companies will make lacklustre earned gear and sell good looking gear, and in an mmorpg where earned gear is a sign of status no one will really buy it or people won't respect those who do, for the most part.
---
GW2 in a nutshell. The supposedly most prestigious, hard earned gear from completing multiple raid achievements look worse than cash shop items coming out every second week. Plus Anet allows raids and PvP "boosting services" from other players so a lot of people just straight up bought the skins with in-game gold or weekly paypal transactions, nullifying any status or prestige tied those armors.
---
I don't even know if I can stay up for 30 hours anymore lol. What kind of substances should I get my hands on to aid me?  
---
Not the release date, but the release date for the actual release date ;)
---
It's one reason Mike was pushed out as CEO. It's why Brack and Ion have tried to sabotage Classic with accelerated time frame, extremely nerfed and dumbed down tier 1 and 2, complete laziness and not even having interns punch in the right itemization that Nost already did for them.
---
This is going to end with Brack and Ion fired. Book it. All their attempts to sabotage the game will fail and then the audience will turn on the influencers who they no longer trust and that are obviously just unethical selfish people who don't care about the game or community and never did. Influencers will lobby for things like cross realm BG's because they are on a PVE server and they need content. People will turn on them and fast. It will be a beautiful thing. Hope they are ready to work fast food jobs again.
---
I'm sorry wise old man. Forgive me for being curious about other people's opinions and logic behind them.
---
Activision.
---
As a max lvl human Warrior i was a master of both Skinning AND Tailoring :)
---
Wotlk was garbage and made the game way too easy.
---
Alright. Hour payment would generate a lot more accounts. Which means a lot of short term players, bots, gold farmers, trolls etc. A monthly fee to one account will be better for the community overall, as people invest more in their accounts.
---
My gut says they won't announce a hard release date until the beta is already underway. I think they'll use the beta as a tool to gauge interest to get a better idea of how many players there will be. And maybe to gauge player acceptance of the stuff they left unfinished. If they go to beta and they mostly get mixed reports and the occasional bug, they'll release sooner. If they go to beta and people absolutely freak out about stuff that they didn't even think about, they'll delay and release a bit later.
---
What if devilsaurs dont skin for devilsaur leather until a patch later on? I dont see how having devilsaur gear available as pre raid gear from day 1 is a smart move. Surely that will be gated wih a patch.
---
And by that I mean devilsaurs would skin for regular leather until a late patch 
---
Maraudon?
---
Honestly I’m the guy that needs 8 hours and doesn’t stay up past 11 pm. Once in a while though a game comes out and the adrenaline and or hype is good enough to where I can go 20 hours easy. Vanilla? I’m sure the hype and the adrenaline and the people etc etc will be enough for me to go decently ham.
---
Seems VERY unlikely + we will know this from beta.
---
But so far it seems like they wont even do item by patch changes. They will just do 1.12 with raid releases as far as we know right now.
---
For sure devilsaur skin and similar stuff like that is lower prio then raid gear and instance gear comming out at the right times, or atleast it's equal prio. So if they do that we will know it beforehand anyway i imagine, since the beta will be the "first patch"
---
I can imagine 2-3 million new subs for Classic's launch but anything more than that would surprise me. In a good way of course. Ultimately I hope that this Classic project will have enough success to trigger the making of TBC and LK servers as well, because those are the real WoW era that I wish to play over vanilla.
---
Unfortunately I have no faith in ATV-Blizzard anymore. I expect they will launch Classic during a BFA content drought, precisely 31 days after a small BFA patch because they love those scummy moves recently to make people renew their subs. I expect retail players to whine massively over the difficulty of the leveling journey and quit within a couple weeks. Then a couple months after Blizzard will ship a new raid to BFA along with a few catch-up-gear instances to appeal to the Classic subs and bait them into trying BFA.
---
At the end of the day I'm afraid it's all just another marketing manoeuver to keep the stock prices on life support after the massive crash following the BFA and Blizzcon debacle and it's very difficult to be optimistic about any Blizzard's intellectual property despite how much I loved their games before.
---
More like a sub didn't prevent Activision from adding that
---
I dont really get this.  There were always boss guides available unless you were on the bleeding edge in vanilla WoW.  There were usually videos showing how guilds did their world 1st kills (usually released a bit after the next couple of guilds killed it) and there were still addons available that shouted that you are indeed THE BOMB.  The only difference now is there might be more misinformation because people are taking it all from private servers which may or may not have the correct values as opposed to from live servers.
---
you shouldn't be worried if it gets down-voted. you should worry if you say something hateful or undocumented or if you cant present proof to sustain your initial claim.
---
anyway, the thing is 15$/month proved to be a viable business model on 4 continents so it is you, the individual that's is kinda below the line here.
---
also studies prove that the interest on this game varied according to content and not to the cost.
---
What do you mean with box cost?
---
He's rapping about Classic Wow 
---
The initial wave that I see its between 4 million (most conservative figure) and 15 million (most optimistic, but still realistic figure).
---
When estimating how many players will play Classic, most people have this stupid idea that no child have been born in the world in the last 30 years, and ONLY those who played back in Vanilla are the one who will play Classic, this leading to the another dumb idea that "most have families and jobs, hence, they won't play Classic". Another stupid idea that those people have is that nobody OUTSIDE WoW will play Classic.
---
There is a very comprehensive study about games (all type of games) from Princeton, spanning for 10+ years. Today, the AVERAGE age of the player is 36 years old. In other words, out of those over 130 million WoW accounts created since 2004, not even 3 million (and that is a highly optimistic figure) are playing BfA, the last iteration of WoW.
---
Where are the rest of 127 million? Since the average age of the gamer today is 36...clearly, those 127 million FORMER wow players are most likely playing other games (any other games, not only MMOs).
---
Since the population of Vanilla private servers is around 1.2 million people...that still leaves over 125 million former WoW players NOT playing WoW (be it on private servers or BfA).
---
The reasons why they stopped playing WoW are various, including jobs, families, etc., but not limited to. BfA is a dumpster fire, and the reasons why the former WoW players are not playing BfA are crystal clear : BfA SUX BALLS.
---
Now, why aren't they flooding the Vanilla private servers ? Well, simply because the vast majority (I would say at least 90% of them) do not want to INVEST time on a private server that will close in 6 months. Or because the lack of security. Or gold farmers.  Or simply because they can no longer afford to spend time outside their jobs and families.
---
Out of those 125 million people, let's say that 90% of them hate Vanilla, or simply have no time to play an MMO. That still leaves over 12 million people that are NOT playing on private servers, for various reasons I mentioned before.
---
Will those 12 million people play Classic on launch? It is possible, but highly improbable. Still, a percentage of them WILL at least try Classic at launch. I think a 1/5th of them will try Classic at launch. And that is around 2.4 million players. Add the 1.2 million players from private servers, and you get 4 million people at Classic launch.
---
And 4 million is a very, very low figure. It is going to be far more than that, because there are, potentially, 12 million former WoW players out there. And that is if 90% of the 125 million are somehow unable / unwilling to do it.
---
How about people from outside WoW, people who, like us, have seen their MMO butchered and/or killed? You, know, those old gamers, that are hungry for a CLASSIC MMO, even if its WoW, and not their old game.
---
We could, potentially, see over 15 million people trying Classic in the first 2-3 months (staggered realm release), but most likely it won't happen.
---
The real numbers will probably be in between 4 and 15 million people. I do not exclude 6-8 million Classic players at launch. How many will stay?
---
That is something nobody knows.
---
Join the Crimson death and bring pain to all alliance scum
---
Going for Core hound tooth and Perdition Blade
---
Main tank and Trial of the Crusader.
---
Vanilla had 8 million at peak, all new players. TBC had 11 million at leak (so, added only 3 million new players compared to Vanilla). WOTLK had 12.4 million at peak (so, added only 1.4 million new players compared to TBC).
---
Vanilla was the GIANT. All other expansion after added far less players compared to Vanilla, making ALL OF THEM, far less popular than Vanilla.
---
This is how you look at numbers. Not the way you do it.
---
What the... Why not roll on an European server if you live in Europe? There are no "UK" servers...
---
I hope so for me but I can't be 100% sure haha. I know I can go at least 16 hours. The two things that prevent me from going super hard are eye pain and butt pain. I've done two things in preparation for this so far. I bought blue light filtering glasses to reduce eye strain, and I bought a sit/stand adjustable desk with a motor so I can switch to standing mid-gaming.  
---
I'm trying to think of other things that will hold me back so I can plan against them also. I will be attempting to simulate a 16 hour session soon to find those problems.  
---
This is a fantastic cosplay!  That staff (Glowing Brightwood) is my favorite in game, to boot!  Very well done!
---
Trial accounts are NOT considered in this statistic. Only subbed accounts, which is basically PLAYERS. Sure, some might had 2 accounts, but 99% didn't.
---
And 100 million figure is AT THE END Of 2012. Add 6 more years.
---
Most likely, over 130 million people played WoW as subscribers, since 2004, 100 million of them BEFORE 2013. Which is why this is the number that was chosen.
---
You are in the same situation I'm in. Which I know isn't helpful but least we're not alone, lol. 
---
I'm pretty set on playing mage or hunter really at first. If I go heavy into raiding (Which would take a significant life/ gf choice) I'd probably main mage but as for race and faction it's so hard to decide.
---
I've always played alliance too so been thinking horde but not sure about undead and troll races.
---
I agree with what you have had to say. But blizzard are doing the other two you mentioned Cosmetics and P2W they even do PFG. The need of classic is massive hopefully take it back to the old proper MMORPG roots 
---
Who dared you to do this madness
---
Pay for the game upfront as well as the sub cost. 
---
I’m on crack
---
So instead of opening a ticket and have GM's watch how many times people dodge BG games which would solve dodging, we should just have dead realms and ruined server communities because... maybe they will dodge bg's?
---
If you really wanna challenge yourself and learn the most about the class, I would suggest waiting until classic comes out. You'll learn the most about the class, and have fun doing so! 
---
Don't listen to these people. Just go and play it and see how you enjoy it. I love classic wow and I'm enjoying current retail wow too.
---
It works because they had no real competition in the genre. When you have a monopoly, you can basically do whatever you want and get away with it.
---
Best Warrior professions? The goal is end game. Grind out to 60 as fast as possible, join a guild, raid raid and raid some more. 
---
You willing to bet on that? I would love to lose such a bet, because I’m planning to do exactly that...
---
The Cathedral of Light in Stormwind. It's so cozy and pleasant and serene. I love it so much. 
---
I'd go Kopp's over that, but both are far from optimal compared to what people have managed since. If you really want to level fast, then killing mobs efficiently and not wasting time with professions etc is actually more important.
---
Every class I played in vanilla feels wrong if I try to play it in retail, specifically the mechanics.  I'm not sure it would happen the other way around but why take the chance?
---
Even with ''the pile of shit that BfA is'' 5 million subs is still 75 million dollars a month just from subscriptions.
---
And the OP clearly was comparing overall revenue troughout wow's history with development cost don't know why you even brought up BfA?
---
&gt; the likes of which could rival or surpass league of legends, fortnite
---
hahaha this sub gets delusional sometimes, but this is new peak for sure
---
A lot of the reason why they got rid of talent trees was because it took up a lot of resources to maintain, update, and fix 30 talent trees (10 classes in game by WotLK). That and now that people can level to 120 (80 was cap in Wrath), talent trees would be 3 page documents that you’d have to scroll up and down to find anything. It would be stale and cluttered in the current game. 
---
The new talent system isn’t perfect by any means, and certainly takes away the individuality of character building, but they baked in a lot of old procs or stat boosts to classes. Creating hundreds of individual talents, each different than the other, for whatever little change to your character, a lot of which will not be chosen by players... it’s a lot. A lot of work and resources spent when they can be saved by baking the talents in. 
---
Just my 2c ofc
---
Same. I know this sub has a boner for classic, i'm in the same boat, but saying wotlk sucked is so dumb. It had the highest sub count for a reason. It certainly didnt suck. It's my favorite expansion ever. But doesn't mean that classic or tbc are bad. Those are just as good. But wotlk is just a tad better. Mainly because classes and raids are so much more fun. 1 button rotations were never fun to me. That's where wrath wins over classic.
---
Can you point me to a better option?
---
I wont be using it, because it sucks
---
Probably joana'a guide that he's still updating. He's the world record holder for speed levelling in vanilla. 
---
Ban them for what? Not joining a BG? 
---
I dont see how it could generate more bots, gold farmers and trolls. Maybe trolls but its a stretch? Bots and gold farmers will loose alot of money with an hour sub since bots can play 24/7 and gold farmers share accounts.
---
So with a montly fee there will be maybe less trolls but more gold farmers and bots, maybe we should only have sub by the hour to eliminate bots and gold farmers.
---
If you set food in nax during vanilla or at least progressed further than the easiest bosses you    -were-  on the bleeding edge. Also the difference in information quantity depth and quality of content has increased a lot during all these years of private servers.
---
You never have to grind for a single second if you don't want to.
---
There are FAR more quests available in 1.12 than you need to reach 60, provided you're prepared to travel around to eliminate the lowest level quests and not just stay in a single zone doing everything you can.
---
Yeah but they will also loose some of the market with only a monthly fee. However, nobody will decide not to play if they have both. I dont see any negative impact by pay by the hour since it would probably be more expensive than monthly fee.
---
The class plays so much different in retail it might.  You might get used to things or build muscle memory in an ineffective way.  If you want to familiarize yourself with the class watch some classic warlock pvp videos or read up on class skills/guides.
---
discord breeds cancer just as much as streaming does
---
i guess i just kind of liked it. it was easy to get plate healing gear in raids because a lot of people didnt want it and thats what i would wear in pvp. it also sort of worked as a balance that you would do less healing in pvp but become much stronger and it was worth it. but i get why some people dont like it if they want to look badass when raiding 
---
We had Teamspeak/Ventrilo back in the day and it was fine. This won't be a big deal. Some will use discord, some will not. 
---
Where can i read this data? Its interesting
---
If you're not going to pvp much you don't have to do engineer.  Herb enchanting is really good for getting your own pot/flask materials and enchanting your own gear.  If you tank you can say you want the blue drops that no one needs from dungeons at 60 and get a lot of extra money/materials.   The odds of getting top end blacksmith recipes are very low and most of the good things are boe.  
---
6 months™️ is too hopeful. My guess is a release date in April/May for it to go live in August/September. 
---
&gt; It's like claiming that playing basketball against toddlers is = to playing against high school kids.
---
Even ignoring the fact you're vastly exaggerating: no, it's not. It's like saying it's not equal level of play, but it's still playing basketball. 
---
Raiding is raiding. Casual raiding is unequal to hardcore raiding, but it's still raiding. 
---
As I said: stop using No True Scotsman argument, it's bullshit. 
---
&gt;I feel like it was mid WotLK where things went south
---
Almost as if something [big happened](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-merger-official/1100-6193580/) to blizzard around that time
---
Does accounts mean unique bnet addresses, or the game accounts atrached to each?
---
Guides or extra resources (eg Elitist Jerks) have existed for such a long time. If people want the info they're going to look for it. 
---
TIL Activision partnered with Blizzard in 2009
---
yeah my plan is to be a main or off tank. they told me cooking is good as well for the buffs
---
If there was one thing that I thought I wanted but didn't was flying mounts.
---
I remember being ecstatic about getting a flying mount in the outlands. Then I thought about how PvP would work on mounts and  then noticed how everything was empty as fuck since everyone was flying... the realization of flying being a big mistake slowly sunk in.
---
You forget replace you with your evil twin
---
it will probably not be fun imo. from my experience people need to start a lvl 1 on their own and play otherwise they need like a partner to do quests for them. i would make her play on her own at least to lvl 20 
---
Its probably not bnet accounts as B.net integration for WoW came a lot later than WoW release, also there are probably a lot of b.net accounts that don't have WoW. 100 million unique ppl probably not, but that was also never implied or said. However do see that this was 5 years ago. The number of accounts will be a lot higher by now ofcourse. 
---
The actual infographic explicitly states that it includes trial accounts
---
What? Do skills cost more at the Moonglade trainers?
---
Joana's is a horde guide.
---
No I can't. I'm going to be using Kopp's as a reference myself tbh.
---
you dont need to practice. you will learn the class fine just by leveling. i suggest going affliction though because nightfall/siphon life is amazing for leveling imo. you can throw tons of dots up on mobs to siphon their life away and proc a ton of nightfalls from corruption dots
---
2008 actually.
---
&gt;In raiding you use one button 99 percent of the time on many classes  
---
bad design, lack of time/resources; one or both of these, I would just go with bad design personally (debuff limit, balance issues, mana etc.)  
---
&gt;In PVP on the same class (Mage is a good example) you use the entire spellbook   
---
Yea because player is susceptible to all spells unlike bosses. You can use the entire spell book in dungeons tho, if situation within that dungeon calls for it.  
---
&gt;and PvP is harder that modern WoW classes  
---
Citation needed. Its definitely not btw.  
---
&gt;Kaplan designed the raids so Grandma's could do them  
---
Whole of WoW is designed like that, that's why it got popular. The most casual MMO of every aspect when it released.  
---
&gt;CLASS DESIGN WAS ENTIRELY BASED ON PVP and not raiding  
---
Nah. You can use all your spells in the world and dungeons. Very few spells were pvp specific. There is a reason you are cherry picking "raiding" instead of just saying "PVE".  
---
&gt;Raiding was meant to be accessible and social  
---
keyword "meant". They saw that they failed for the most part and later on reduced the size and introduced multiple difficulties in order to make it more accessible. 
---
&gt;That is the point of old WoW. You are supposed to be able to progress with people you actually like and FRIENDS  
---
You can do the same even more now with multiple difficulties.  
---
&gt;Not theorycrafters and abusive people who everyone hated playing with in the first place and that they then designed the game around  
---
Sounds a lot like vanilla private server community. Makes you go hmmmmmm doesn't it?  
---
&gt;That is why the WoW community is trash now  
---
"Old good. New bad" lol nice   
---
&gt;Modern WoW rewards players for leaving friends and family behind, that they are forced to leave behind to progress or even see content  
---
What does this even mean? Lots of people did the same in every expansion. If your friends suck dick and you want to progress you leave and join the better guild and get rewarded. Always happened. Man, you are just straight up delusional.  
---
&gt;It's the worst game design in history and why subs have fallen  
---
Oh we got a aspiring game designer here. And not that's not only reason why subs have fallen. Its because game has competitors today unlike back then.  
---
&gt;Old WoW locked progression behind gear accumulation that the best players could bypass with consumables and strats to get a few months ahead. Those encounters were never supposed to be beaten quickly by the average player without slow accumulation of gear in that tier. Or be too difficult to clear. Only Naxx forced a ton of consumables because it was the last raid and "beating the game".  
---
You are really trying to make yourself sound like you're shit at the game. 
---
What exactly are you trying to make a point about? That PVP was harder than PVE? Of course it was. This is the case for every expansion. Non-scripted vs Scripted, obvious.  
---
That doesn't mean game was designed around PVP or for PVP. No battlegrounds at launch. No competitive mode until TBC and Cata (rated bgs), barely any new content for PVP for every game version.  
---
Wow wasn't my first video game but I did start playing vanilla back in 04 when I was like 11 or 12. 
---
I'm sure if I can figure stuff out and enjoy it at that age, your girlfriend with her vastly higher IQ can manage.
---
It was definitely my first MMO and PC game with that kind of keyboard layout.
---
I didn't even use key binds until mid to late TBC. 
---
It's worth a shot.
---
Anyway, what's it gonna cost to set an account up for her? 15 bucks? (Assuming you're in the US) or like £10 UK? 
---
why not let her play on your account for a while? 
---
okay mate. thanks. 
---
I reckon a more valuable number would be whatever the population of the private servers is/was ±20‰.
---
I watched a warrior roll on the 6int 1 agi ring from Deadmines because he could use the agi. The mage and priest were not happy
---
Or what about the one that came with d2?
---
I recently caved and opened a retail Diablo II box, and was pleasantly surprised (and reminded) that it came with it.
---
yes, you need cenarion circle rep for them to be cheap too.
---
They shouldn’t do that if they are going to call Wow an RPG. Taking away the Individual choices because it’s convenient for game development is a major sin in my eyes. I don’t care if it’s hard on the developers I care about being able to do exactly what I want with my characters. Taking away any player choice It is the root of a lot of the problems in the current game.
---
You really think vanilla wow sold 100+ million copies? 
---
Cooking is a secondary skill, not a profession.
---
5 million subs? Try 2 million
---
And post #38262638484 with the same statement here.....it gets boring.
---
I feel like they understand the deal quite well here. They will waste a lot of money and time on the product if they try to fuck with it. I don't like classic / private server community that much, but i know for a fact that people ain't gonna play on classic if it's a shittier version of vanilla.
---
IIRC, they had to run them through BRD to get them in or they had to be attuned first. While I get your point and agree to some extent, there are differences.
---
If you're at all worried about how Classic will turn out, I urge you to watch the Classic team Blizzcon panel or read the recent German interview. Regardless of what's going on with the rest of the company, Classic is in good hands.
---
Story behind this is that I worked at Circuit City (age 17). I had already played both beta's and coming from EverQuest, I knew I wanted to play this. When. The shipment came in, I "forgot" to stock one of them on the shelf and then later purchased it once I got off my shift.
---
Played a female NE Hunter during betas (of course) and then later formed a all Dwarf guild on Earthen Ring (RP) named &lt;The Longbeards&gt;. In that time, I raided Tauren Mill with bags full of ale, held an in game wedding in Elwyen Forrest, marched on Ogrimar, and made many friends along the way.
---
It's a fine choice for a first game. What an adventure she has to come!
---
It really isn't though cause that also means that those vanilla players didn't quit. A new game will always bring in more players than an expansion of said game.
---
You are simply trying to make your point the "correct" one when the truth is that both are equally "correct".
---
Hopefully June 21st, first Summer day. 
---
I won't use it, I'll just stick to /2 and /4
---
The lowest numbers I saw were 4 million estimated , cause blizzard doesn't publish these numbers anymore.
---
So everything is speculation.
---
That is a very harsh statement! Streaming will no doubt have a huge effect on the servers where they go, and this effect is one I dislike and aim to stay away from, I can agree with that.
---
But Discord is not streaming, at all, not even remotely close...
---
Besides, as Nyxze said just a minute after you left your comment; things like Teamspeak and Ventrilo which worked more or less the same as Discord does, was perfectly fine!
---
Streaming will in my opinion be bad for classic, but Discord? Nah, that's a-okay.
---
Wow, okay then. To each their own, I guess.
---
In PvP pallies shouldn't be in the cloth gear anyway.
---
Honestly I think having some items that fit across multiple specs makes them more iconic.
---
Just go horde and raid as 2-handed arms, really. With Windfury Totem, your DPS will be fine. Not great or anything compared to the 2handed fury guys, but fine.
---
Either is perfectly fine. Not being on discord or anything that offers communication in that way, will make the game way more immersive, when the only ones you talk to are people within your proximity in-game (Unless you are in a Guild). For things like raiding however, getting to have communication could be a crucial aspect. Not just raiding either, if you are questing with someone else in a group, then being able to talk in voice with one another would be extremely helpful.
---
Is Rin'wosho the Trader (the guy who sells the Bloodvine Patterns among other things) going to be in Classic at launch most likely or only at a later stage?
---
I would love to hear this explained in more detail.
---
That is the sunk cost fallacy. You aren't losing money that you already spent. There is no difference in your bank account if you playing the game or not so there really is no reason to worry about it. If you don't think it is worth your time then just don't pay them the next month.
---
Well, Blizzard said some time ago that most renevue comes from services and not subscriptions. Depending on the influence that Activision has on Classic, they'll certainly try to add services to Classic.
---
On the other hand, after Classic is launched with all its features, they'll not have more development costs, and the subscription from Classic players will be enough to keep the game giving some money. The problem starts if players stop playing retail to play Classic. That would be much less money from retail services, and in that case we should see they taking some actions and adding cash stuff.
---
I liked how the warlock trainers were always hidden away in dark corners except for the Undercity, where they're presented just as obviously as mage trainers. 
---
Truly shows the different moral background of the Forsaken compared to the other races.

If what you are saying about a server wide Discord, that would be horrible. The answer to avoiding that however is very simple: Just don't join it. If everyone are reluctant to join, or alteast many, then their experience won't be "ruined" and they can spam tradechat with "LFG Need Tank and Healer for Deadmines" as much as they want!
---
Thing is, if enough people stay away from using Discord, then the people who do use Discord, won't get that much out of it, as the more people who stand against that idea, the less populated those dicord servers get, and the less desirable it becomes to the ones who want to use it.
---
To the ones that do still use it, they may get more close, as they are few in number, and instead change the alleged Server discord into thier own Guild discord as time goes on.
---
That is just a theory, and the chance that it would go down like that is slim. People using a Server wide discord to get what they want easier will probably happen, but ignorance is bliss, so as I said, just don't join and you won't have to care!
---
What the hell are you talking about? Are you trolling or just high? Nostalrius had 200k ACCOUNTS. Accounts mean jack shit. Accounts mean shitton of chinese botters, multiboxers and all sort of irelevant crap, especially on private servers where it doesnt cost you anything to make a bunch of accounts. It had peak players around 6-7k, that translates in somewhere around 50k active players overall MAX.
---
I wouldnt mind in the slightest wow classic beeing a huge insane success and me beeing wrong about the numbers, but do i believe it will happen and after first month of hype will be higher than 500k max? No, because there are no arguments to believe that. I think you highly underestimate the level of spoon feeding the majority of players are used to in this gaming era.
---
Also the amount of rose tinted nostalgia the players who miss classic but havent played in 10+ years due to staying away from private servers. Some will stay. But definetely a minority in my opinion
---
This. If I was working an mmo would be a waaaay too big time investment.
---
Remember, someone who was 12 in 2004 when the game came out is now turning 27. 
---
Don’t forget that wowhead consists for 98% of retail players.
---
She could punish me till I saw the light..
---
Lag wont be a problem on EU english servers , for sure. In US it might be, but theres no reason to do that if you are playing from europe.
---
It highly depends if you really wanna communicate in your native language or not.
---
High level oozes, kind of first seen in Hinterlands 42-48 the cave around them is pretty nice if you’re an herbalist too. Ghost mushrooms spawn with Sungrass being around the area too. Ooze pet is pretty damn rare tbh
---
Seems like extra work for blizzard. They’ll just decide what’s best and implement it, they don’t have unlimited resources to please every player 
---
You can already see the modern game shifting towards classic. Things like anchor weed in BFA has an insanely long respawn time making them similar to black lotus in rarity. Things like bringing back the cthun eyebeam for a mythic mytharax. The new M+ affix is stolen directly from the nefarian boss battle in bwl. They kept the reward acquisitions for island expeditions a mystery like how content used to be a total mystery in classic. They don't do flying mounts anymore. They're definitely taking small steps in the right direction it's just they've changed so much at this point it's not like they can flip their morales overnight. The change needs to happen slowly over multiple expansions.
---
Sharding is needed, as well as 2019 graphics innovations and some other minor features. 
---
Problem is I dislike Horde in every aspect :/. Sure, them racials are pretty op but the races and architecture just put me off completely.
---
If nobody takes me to raid as arms on the Alliance side then I guess I'll just have to settle for the best gear I can get my hands on outside those but I'll probably get stomped in pvp hard like that. Rank 10 gear won't hold up forever (and I have no chance of getting rank 14 with a job xD)
---
&gt; unlike lfr and lots of the other features which we hate for catering to casuals
---
It's like you don't even understand the problem. Stop this "omg Vanilla was hardcore, now it's for filthy casuals".
---
The problem with LFR is how it trivialize finding groups where before it required more social talking. It has *nothing* to do with being casual or hardcore, it is about community strength.
---
As for flying mounts, I agree somewhat. They are not a big problem compared to other things. What it did totally and utterly destroy was world PvP.
---
That's true, it's still an important distinction to keep in mind.
---
While we don't have actual figures anymore, it was estimated a little while ago that even the success of legion saw a pretty small spike in players relative to the game's peak in wotlk. I don't think the number will be that much higher. 100 Mil is still an impressive number either way.
---
No changes community is pretty annoying. I went through the same shit with OSRS and those players did not help the future of that game. Had no changes happened OSRS wouldn’t be at that x15 player base as it is right now. 
---
Changes need to happen and will happen. Whether it’s sharding, balancing, quality of life updates or future content. 
---
Teamspeak and Vent didn't have the community/chatroom features (at least they didn't when i last used them). I think OPs point has more to do with the chat in discord and not just using it for comms. Discord chat is just like twitch chat with the memes, emotes, trolling, ect.  Unless it's heavily moderated I can understand the minor concern one would have with discord. 
---
stretch every flight path
---
I’m not sure if it has been mentioned, but if you plan on playing holy priest - you’ll probably end up farming lashers in Dire Maul: East a fair bit with holy nova, and in that room you regularly find Gromsblood and dream foil (both are used in elixirs/flasks), so having Herbalism can significantly raise the profit from farming DM:E.
---
No, because with a monthly sub you know you cant affect the cost of the sub by constantly trying to log off to "save minutes on my sub costs". With monthly sub you always know exactly what you pay.
---
I doubt they are going to have multiple servers with different solutions. My guess will be sharding in the starter zones the first weeks, the fact that there is no items on AH and a fresh economy is part of the fun, starting equal with everyone else. Hopefully sharding the first week upto lvl 10 before removed. That should help plenty with the launch problems and still not destroy peoples experience.
---
Well you could probably get away with being an Arms off-tank. 31/4/16 is great, even gets you Iron Will for pvp.
---
I somewhat agree, but on the other hand,
---
&gt;arena being more popular than BG's
---
If people enjoy arena more then it's not a problem. I get the impact it had (along with a lot of other things) to the community, but honestly I don't get why people say arena was part of destroying the game. If anything it kept PvP alive for the following xpacs.
---
&gt; The decline was MORE VISIBLE in the last part of Wrath, but let's be honest...it started in TBC.
---
Of course. This was their first xpac and they saw how many people played the game yet how small a percentage got to actually experience most of the content they made (especially with Naxx being fresh in memory). It honestly made sense to make everything more available. The whole "only a select elite will get to this content" is cool for the select elite, but if a majority of players will never get to try it then it is objectively a stupid design. Ulduar in WoTLK is a perfect example of a raid done right. Most players got to experience it, but if you was part of the hardcore playerbase you could activate extra mechanics to make the fight harder and gain better drops. It was catering to both audiences. It is never a good design to say "fuck casuals".
---
I'd disagree with you there. 
---
Sure vanilla raids wasn't mechanically complex but they had very specific gear checks that you had to pass which made it feel like both you and your character had to progress in order to beat the encounter.
---
TBC did away with some of that but I'd say that for the most part we had some really challenging encounters in all the raids. I can't remember any of the end bosses being particularly easy.
---
The beginning of Wrath on the other hand was a shit show. The only challenging encounter was the hard mode version of Sartharion and that was completely optional. It was however the first tier, it was supposed to be easy, maybe not that easy but still easy. With Ulduar it seemed like they were back on track. The base version of the raid was quite challenging and the hard modes were a great way of sticking some more challenges in there.
---
With TotC it was like they gave up. They wanted a simple version and a difficult version but for some reason everyone had to do the simple version even if they weren't the target audience.
---
I don't mind multiple difficulties at all. What I mind is having to start off a new tier on a trivial difficulty because the reward structure says so. If I could go through an expansion at my chosen difficulty I wouldn't have a problem with it. 
---
The 10/25 split at the beginning of Wrath was a pretty good way of handling multiple difficulties since there was no overlap. As a 25m raider there was no incentive at all to do 10m Ulduar because it held no upgrades so we could continue our journey in 25m.
---
In BfA as a heroic raider I have to start off the new tier by doing fucking LFR because it drops the same iLvl as heroic Uldir. I then have to go through normal and replace all my gear I worked on for months in Uldir and then finally I can continue my progress in heroic.
---
Progressing through difficulties should never be a thing. Mythic raiders should only have to do mythic, heroic raiders only heroic and so on
---
You dont understand what a monopoly is.
---
Maybe this game isn't for you. 
---
Does priest's Power Word: Shield scales up with +healing power?
---
If you can speak english decently i highly urge you to go on an english server and since you are asking for german or french i am just going to assume you are from europe so English EU will be your best choice for a good population.
---
Im kinda afraid of WPvP. I used to play holy priest but on a PvE realm (wasn’t my choice).
---
Which classes will make people pass on ganking me besides hunters ? I don’t want to be an easy target while leveling.
---
There's very few players queuing for battlegrounds already, so making up ways to split them up further will just make make queue times exponentially longer. People play twinks exactly because it's an uneven playing field and because the gearing process is actually rather interesting when the game isn't dictating what you can and cannot do.
---
Not being able to lock your XP means you can actually fuck up so first you need to figure out how to obtain your gear and then hope you're lucky enough for them to drop before you level up. What if you figure out something else is better later on? Too bad, level another character and do it again. Many of the PVP factions and Ranks grant significant rewards but take absolutely forever to grind while you're low level. We're talking about thousand of gold being spend on niche gear and consumables while also having to run around the world collecting world buffs if you really want to go ham.
---
If someone is bored enough to go through all that garbage and sit in a queue for hours just to plow helpless noobs then I have absolutely no problem with it, nor should you. Don't confuse genuine bugs/oversight with someone being mean. The retail game got exponentially more terrible with each expansion they decided to start forcing people to play the way they intended rather than letting people figure out their own adventure.
---
He's not wrong. Caring about gear and your character is the most important thing to get you invested. When everything is replaceable then guess what, so is the game.
---
He is working on an alliance guide that will be ready by classic.
---
It was not mentioned, thanks a lot for this! It is indeed an important point.
---
Not to mention if leveling in classic is too much of a grind for you then you are not cut out for "hardcore raiding". You can certainly raid, but hardcore raiding requires hours of consumable, gear and rep farming. If you want to be able to keep up with hardcore raiders you better enjoy grinding/farming with your class. 
---
Alliance pve. Horde PvP.
---
This has been obvious for quite some time. People are stupid however and refuse to believe anything other than it running off of 7.3.5 because that's what the demo did.
---
Both Classic and retail will run the same client version, when it gets updated both games get that update. They don't want to manage two separate clients for the same game, they want them to share the same client.
---
There's also a cave in EPL with oozes that drop the bags.
---
Hopefully not 
---
Arena was more popular due to gear. You had to play it to get pvp gear. On top of that it was the only option for ranked or competitive pvp due the lack of ranked bgs.
---
A lack of alternatives and requirement to enter does not mean arena helped keep anything alive. It was so bad due destroying the epic feel of combat, homogenising everything and shitting on the RP aspect of PvP.
---
~~M~~MO~~RPG~~
---
This is why i'd love it if they do something other than tbc classic if they decide to add on to classic wow.
---
I think the best thing they could do is re-purpose the expansions with classic wow philosophy.
---
You don’t understand what a monopoly is.
---
&gt; Regardless of what's going on with the rest of the company, Classic is in good hands.
---
That's my impression aswell.    
---
The folks at Blizzard must be aware that people would just go back to playing on private servers if they mess this up, but they went ahead and green-lit the project anyways.
---
From everything I've seen/heard/read of the team responsible for Classic so far, I got the impression that they are really passionate about the whole thing and know who their target audience is - they actually seem to "get it".     
---

---
I love achievements, nothing wrong with collecting they added a huge amount to do.
---
I would strip down all the title rewards though, the system to unlock flying in WoD was actually briliant imo far better than 'just buy it'. 
---
The one issue with achievements imo is the whole 'link or no inv'. 
---
I dont think pugs will do voice because of Discord. Raiding perhaps. Guilds will likely use discord.
---
Either way, I dont think it is an issue whether people use it or not.
---
It was undetuned and it spoiled the whole thing. Ulduar was perfect, difficult on normal mode but doable. And hard modes for better players.
---
Shame they didn't come up with that idea in Naxx
---
I just got off work (second job over night) and I stared at that sentence for a long time trying to figure out what you meant. "Stretch every flight path...? Like make it longer?"  
---
Finally figured it out. TIME FOR BED. This is why I can't play WoW for 30 hours straight.  
---
Vanilla WoW at its peak had 8 million users, and you honestly think that classic at launch is going to have 2 million more than that because of a random 100 million users statistic and some percentages you pulled out of no where? That number includes gold farmers, trial account, people who started in expansion and don't have vanilla nostalgia. 10% of that number returning is WAY off, and would probably be closer to .5% at most. Now that's still a lot of users since its not even counting new people and people already subscribed trying out classic, but this post has way too much hyperbole.
---
What's wrong with achievements
---
Ok I'm 100% sure you didn't even read the post
---
When I played on pservers, Discord was only used for raiding and premades. Don't see why classic would be any different.
---
I didn't know english very well when i started playing vanilla, i didnt understand quests or the RPG genre at all. Still I had loads more fun than any other game I had played before, even with just running around trying to figure out what to do, thats part of the adventure. There is also addons that can help her, quest indicator addons to show her where to go if she is struggeling with reading quests and understanding them. Vanilla is much more slow paced and slowly she will start to learn mechanics and what the game is about, the movement will come natural after a while, gotta crawl before you walk :)
---
I have been saying that they should make it so that you pick your difficulty when you pick your realm. That could potentially fix so many problems with retail. It's the getting there that would be difficult. 
---
At your side m'lady 
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with the Activision merge. At least at that time Activision had nothing to do with Blizzard games. It was purely Blizzard who did those changes in WotLK, and as I remember they were not ill recieved by the community. Many of the features pre-cata were things the community had asked for.
---
Elitest jerks was pretty cool. These youtube guides are literally only an attempt to milk a cash cow though. Every single one of them have ads 
---
Careful, you might actually summon a good Blizzard game. 
---
F for Ghost.
---
Would bang
---
If arena wasn't balanced around and wasn't the main source of gear it would have been great. As it was they took huge battles against the Alliance or Horde, fighting for domination in Ashenvale, Arathi amd Alterac, and turned it into 4 people from the same faction having a scrap in a big sand pit with no ties whatsoever to the outside world.
---
Then made it so it was the only source of the good PvP gear and the fastest mounts. All the best stuff from PvP came from fighting your own side rather than War with the enemy. Considering the name of the game that was a wierd decision.
---
Now that I do get, and I also fear it. However I'll be playing on an RP server, so likeminded people would hopefully stay away from making something like that... hopefully!
---
Rogues can sometimes get away with a blind and vanish. Druids are pretty good too. But really if a high enough level wants to kill you you are pretty much dead. If you get away from a high level player it's most likely luck not skill.
---
I agree that Arena did get a ton of popularity due to ranked and the gear connected to it, but people people still played it a lot when they had their conquest gear.
---
Still, if you look at modern WoW we now have ranked BGs and alternative ways to get the same gear that arena grants. Still, arena seems more popular than ranked BGs. 
---
Honestly, it makes sense. People love running in to kill something. Just look at random BGs, people run around like headless chickens with no other goal than to kill people. The arena grants you just that. No other objective than to kill the other team and it's 2, 3 or 5 man so more intense combat depending on what sized group you want.
---
As for destroying epic feel of combat - if people choose arena over a long BG that shows people would rather have that. Sure at the time there were no alternatives for gear, but why didn't people abandon arena once they got their gear? Because people enjoyed it. Like they still do with alternatives.
---
As for keeping PvP alive, I think it did. Partly due to wPvP being destroyed, so BG's were all that were left. Honestly I don't think PvP would work with only that as a platform for PvP. That's why I say Arena kept it alive. Especially the ranked part, since competition keeps a gamemode alive.
---
I don't think this is gonna happen, didn't on private servers atleast. Most people use /2 and /join world (/5).
---
Discord will mostly be used guild based, atleast that's my guess
---
sounds good  
---
they are doing some heavy engi work to make wow run better and look better   
---
People choose the path of least resistance. Thats why people use heirlooms and LFG. Doesn't make them a good thing!
---
YOU FACE JARAXXUS EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION
---
HAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA
---
&gt;  I picked weapons off of top damage alone
---
Funny enough that part was right. As a hunter you want high dmg since it affects you abilities like Aimed Shot better. 
---
As for me, I leveled as balance on my night elf druid and I didn't know what quests was. I don't even know what I did with gear, but I'm pretty sure I didn't exactly stack stats I needed. Probably went for cosmetics and level of the item.
---
&gt; It's easily the worst raid spec in the game.
---
Ha! Jokes on you. I just didn't raid.
---
Don't mistake resources like sound files, textures for client. Even if it did it wouldn't be an issue IF servers work right with the virtualization. It's still unknown if servers will be as bad as the BFA client and won't be known until a BETA. WE don't know if it's BFA, server infrastructure virtualization or what. 
---
You can do anything under the new clients correctly except maybe spell batching. It's just hard to balance that around old server lag, internet connections vs now. When people attempt to emulate it, it often turns out bad. The new TBC "fresh" is a joke with it. You have double abilities that happen often that aren't supposed to etc.
---
It might never go past 7.3 though. 8.1 would be nice for DX 12 optimization though. Multithreading actually works pretty well in it. We also know it's gonna have a DX 12 backend from QA. 
---
TLDR don't worry about that. Worry if the servers can do this instead of crashing or coming to a standstill with 100 people on screen.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-jv1orcCVQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-jv1orcCVQ)
---
This will also likely include the multi-threaded improvements that were implemented in 8.1. Classic WoW already runs better than BFA and Vanilla, so I'm expecting Classic to run better still once it moves to 8.1+ patches. It's going to be the dream game for low-power or older PCs.
---
While you raise some valid points, don't forget your competition on weapons with hunters. That competition is equal on Alliance and Horde sides, but it does exist.
---
Yeah I'm more than willing to bet on that. But I don't think it's easy to set, we'd have to define what exactly is an experimented player, and only look at people playing still quite fast (maybe one dungeon if you have the quests, no professions...) 5 days /played on a hunter who knows what he's doing means he had quite a few dungeons on his journey.
---
Fuck that addon, hated it with a passion
---
How hard is it to find a raid spot as a hunter?
---
T minus ~5 months til release (re-release?). We’ve reached Peak Delusion. Send help, food, water, Onyxia Scale Cloaks, whatever you’ve got.
---
Bad design that was also present in TBC? Locks pressed one button. Hunters had a one button macro for dps. That was the top two dps lol. Rogues were the  exact same spec basically. Healing got even EASIER where downranking was not as important. Tanking was pretty much the same.
---
Also LOL at you think modern WoW PvP is hard. The last time classes were difficult in PvP MOP. Celestalon ruined all the classes. I don't need a citation either. It's obvious because people now multiclass every melee, every caster and ever spellcaster. That didn't happen in the past and the FEW multiclassers that were great on multiple classes at the top ratings were considered gods. AKA people like Jahmilli.
---
BTW the jokes on you if you are playing a PVE Server in Classic. Tier 1 and 2 have been nerfed and dumbed down below LFR level. Enjoy your dead server with no people playing on it when they realize Activision sabotaged everything until AQ because Ion is somehow the lead on this with Brack in charge and they are protecting their jobs. They will both be fired after Classic is still a success after all their attempts to break it though. I am going to laugh at them and you hard. Raiding was never the big draw. Raiding is what killed WoW.
---
Wait is this real? I didn’t even know it existed.
---
I was 14 in 2004 and played WOW.  We played for like a year and a half and loved it. We were never really “gamers”, we played sports throughout high school and college. Me and my bro heard about classic coming out and started back very recently (1 month ago) on private servers, mainly for old times sake. God damn forgot how addicting it is. Both have gf and full time jobs but we manage to play a few nights a week. I think we will play classic.  
---
Comparing how WOW and BDO aged, i'd say wow aged better
---
WOW got less p2w/cash shop features in 15 years then DBO in 3 years
---
I think I'm going to level both at once and then drop mining after I've bought my epic mount, pre-bis, and can afford 300 eng.  Its not that hard with a toggle macro.  You just have to not get too anal about spamming it all the time.
---
I did not but id say its a good game for a newbie if she avoids pvp like a plague,only if she gets interested should she start participating slowly cause shes gonna be completely hopeless.So if she starts on a pve server or if shes interested in rp itd be a decent choice of a game and a ton of fun if she likes the idea of it and the fantasy.just let her play at her own pace and maybe later on play together cause you dont wanna rush her,just watch as a spectator and explain the basics to her slowly assuming she asks,always try to keep it fun.
---
I think we can cover it in about 8 days /played.
---
's all about that min max, my man!
---
Engineering/Mining.
---
Engineering will give you great AoE threat with [Force Reactive Disk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18168) and [Goblin Sapper Charges](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10646), and there are other niche benefits like [More fire resist](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18638) for tanking Ragnaros.
---
Mining because generally the best way to make money as a warrior is to do DM E jump runs with a healer, which are only worth it if one of you has Mining and can mine the rich thorium veins at the end.
---
none of this posts ends up meaning anything because OP closes by saying classic wow could be as big if not bigger than LoL or Fortnite...
---
everyone just keep in mind, world of Warcraft was created out of the love of video gaming and community, Activision’s ‘classic wow’ is made out of the love of money... stay hopeful, but name the last time Activision has left you satisfied, not as a customer, but as a gamer; have you had fun playing wow the last 5 years? did overwatch kill wow?? has there been anything fun to do on diablo 3 since it’s release in 2012?? just keep these things in mind. i was a major optimist for this game but recently my faith has dwindled and i personally don’t think activision’s classic wow is going to be a good game whatsoever 
---
Not only does it slow your rotation down by delay your first autoshot, it meant I wasted constantly by breaking the 5 second rule. 
---
Your numbers are way off. But I di think that Classic will get between 500k and 2 million subscriptions. We'll see. Private Server players constitute around 150k if I remember correctly.
---
He will be available when ZG launches later. Even if for some reason he was in the game earlier you need to raise Zandalar rep to buy things from him, which you can only do if ZG is available.
---
Yes, but poorly. It has a healing coefficient of 0.1 which means every +1 healing stat increases the amount shielded by 0.1. Here is a [list of spell coefficients](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/)

You whippersnappers, back in my day we logged into Teamspeak uphill both ways, and we liked it.
---
Context. 
---
Toc was a filler raid in between 2 major raids, Ulduar being arguably the best raid ever designed in wow's history, and ICC a top contender as well. It was depressing as shit to leave Ulduar and go to ToC, it felt like leaving a gourmet restaurant to go to a vulgar fast food instead. To me it felt ridiculous and absolutely out of place to be able to obtain better gear from ToC and the Heroic dungeons than from Ulduar. Ulduar's HM encounters were harder and by far. Anub Arak HM was the only fight in ToC that could compare to Ulduar's HM imo. 
---
The problem of ToC wasn't the encounters's design, it was how it was positioned in the release schedule. Most casual guilds couldn't clear ulduar in time before Toc was released,  and decided to skip Ulduar entirely.  Toc was released too early, offered an avalanche of upgrades easy to obtain particularly for casuals and instantly made Ulduar irrelevant. 
---
I hope to God there's a quest add-on like *immerson* in retail, where it shows the quest giver talking to you and creates a more in-depth feel to the quest.  
---
  
---
That and I hope they make druid Mana bar an innate thing, because every druid should really have the druid Mana bar anyways.  
---
Besides that I specifically will not use questie or decursive. Something like atlas loot is nice for dungeon maps and loot but don't really want to use cartographer for the main maps.   
---
I wonder what kind of totem addons they will have as well.
---
Djarii wore it better 👍
---
/2 and /4 will still be used as you reach the biggest ammout of people through these channels. Sure there will be some people that demand you being on discord for groups, but there will be loads of people that dont.
---
Subscriptions “tank” after each Xpac as well.   These “tanks” are preceded by growth spurts.  Blizzard is using Classic, just like X-pac’s to keep Players subscribed.  2 years after Classic debuts, they’re going to re-release The Burning Crusade, and later, WotLK.  
---
I’ve unsubscribed 1-2 months after each of the last X-pacs.   But, I am very certain that I’ll continue subbing to WoW for a long time with Classic.   It’s a long term thing for me.  And I think that it’s going to be this way for a lot of other people who have not yet experienced the community aspect of Vanilla.   
---
I played the game for like 14 years and I only discovered that one a couple months ago. 
---
Hunter raid spots are the most contested of any class since it is a fairly popular class but guilds ideally only want 2. Many will take 3, maybe more in early months before they know they have a few reliable hunters who probably won't randomly quit the game, just so they don't have to worry about not having enough tranquilizing shots because a hunter couldn't make the raid night. Which is still less spots than other classes usually get.
---
0 bucks for frostmourne!!! That's a steal!!

&gt;Bad design and lack of time and resources when the SAME DESIGN was also present in TBC?  
---
This doesn't contradict itself at all like you think it does for some reason.  
---
Its very well known that TBC was rushed. Terrible dungeon muddy textures point at that among other things.  
---
Everything you said afterwards stands to the point. Same people in charge of WoW mostly, same bad design.  
---
&gt;Also LOL at you think modern WoW PvP is hard. The last time classes were difficult in PvP MOP  
---
Define "difficult". Because WoW is a very easy game minus the hardest of its content (top pve difficulty or high arena ranking).  
---
More buttons more difficult? This is the pattern that I see coming from you. More buttons to press does not game more difficult.  
---
If you talk about pruning, it had to happen at some point. Too many spells added over the years. But they went too far in BFA. Legion was fine.  
---
&gt;BTW the jokes on you if you are playing a PVE Server in Classic. Tier 1 and 2 have been nerfed and dumbed down below LFR level  
---
How do you know? We don't have access to classic yet. Even if that were true, what else is there? Grind same bg over and over again with no MMR rating or mmr queue?  
---
&gt;Activision sabotaged everything until AQ because Ion is somehow the lead on this with Brack in charge and they are protecting their jobs. They will both be fired after Classic is still a success after all their attempts to break it though 
---
The levels of delusion you are on is very high lol. They are not going anywhere, especially Allen.   
---
&gt;Raiding was never the big draw. Raiding is what killed WoW.  
---
Imagine playing a PVE MMORPG to play PVP game LMAO   
---
Go play some actual pvp game where skill matters instead of grinding shitty battlegrounds.  
---
And you are wrong, raiding is the core of WoW. That's where the story was always told and finished and that's where most development and players went to.  
---
Also love how you decided on what server type im going to play on. Very amusing to see you break down slowly with each comment.  
---
Can be pretty hard as hunter is a very popular class, along with rogue, warrior and mage. The other classes will scale better with gear and guilds will often want more of those classes if they are focused on progression. Overall hunter is strong in the first tier content. Just find a guild and be active in the gchat, help people out and you will have yourself a raid spot most of the time.
---
Also time zones. 
---
I first was convinced to make a hunter as my first character. I thought I had to repeatedly spam SerpentSting as I didn’t know what a DOT was. That about sums it up.
---
Then he's double counting something.
---
You only need to have a sub + the latest expansion to play.
---
You're free to disagree with me on this - I don't necessarily want to convince you or anyone else of my point of view, but here goes ...
---
I don't like if people would ask me to link some kind of achievement to get an invite. Let's say I completed a raid on my main and now want to do it on an alt and some people don't want to invite me into the raid because my alt doesn't have some achievement. Without an achievement system in place, people would just have to take my word for it and to me that feels better.
---
Additionally it feels like it's a way for a game to give you something particular to do, while I feel in an MMO the world should feel open and one should feel free to choose his own directions. Of course one can ignore achievements, but still I feel it's better if they were never added in the first place. 
---
To use a comment from someone else in another Reddit discussion on achievements:
---
&gt; The achievement is your gear. If you got an epic from BWL then that was your BWL achievement. Just making it to 60 was an achievement, I didn't need someone to tell me that. Or getting Warlord title. The achievement already exists, it's just not displayed in some dinky little interface of hand-out trophies like some people want.
---
&gt; In Vanilla especially I can tell from just looking at someone what they have achieved. Just one look. Gear score and achievements are trying to solve a problem that was already solved in Vanilla. They later un-fixed it, and added gear score and achievements as a band-aid.
---
Here's another opinion on how an achievement can ruin battlegrounds: http://www.brokentoys.org/?p=3744
---
I do understand that for some people achievements are fun. I know some people are completionists and they derive fun by completing a game as much as possible and achievements are a way to give this feeling to these kinds of players. 
---
mage, rogue and hunter will be the least attractive gank targets. Hunter and mage can easy beat a 60 melee as lvl 45+ with kiting. Rogue can vanish and greif you while you try to quest / grind, so ganking a rogue can be a bad idea if that rogue has time to kill.
---
yikes
---
Can talents//items/effects that increase resistance to interrupt effects be bypassed with enough spell hit (for spells), or is the lockout mechanic a separate roll?
---
god damn yes! stop making hte game so fucking cookie cutter and let hte comunity min/max their own shit.
---
Bag this isn't new. Every month there's a new post about how classic is going to surpass fortnite and completely shatter the gaming universe or some shit. Which is so delusional it's funny every time
---
i really did like LK. it was just simple enough for casuals to not be left out of raiding and just hard enough to let the hard core guy deal with hardmodes. ulduar was fucking epic, ICC was loads of fun. the world was amazing. i remember my first time leaving the coldara and walking to scholazar basin, standing on the cliffs and seeing the amazing vista, my tauren prot warrior holding his shield from VoA... my gf at the time running over with her tree druid... so many good memories that im not even sure id want to play it again as it might not live up. 
---
BC had some great times too
---
Yes as Fenral said cooking is a secondary skill along with first aid, fishing, and riding.  Secondary skills do not count towards your 2 allowed main professions.
---
Battlegrounds destroyed world PvP... 90% of world PvP is just high levels ganking lowbies or raid gangbang sessions... If you like PvP you do BG's or Arenas. Yes I'm generalizing some things, obviously not everyone is like this but the majority of it really do be that way.
---
Is GW2 worth checking out until classic comes out?
---
I remember I pre-ordered it, played the beta, then cancelled. Haven't played since then.
---
Classic wow isn't going to surpass Fortnite. Fortnite is multiple times more popular than wow was at its peak.
---
I do, however, expect classic to be more popular than retail, similar to how OSRS eclipsed RS3. Wow classic could very well end up killing retail wow in 2 or 3 years.
---
It's not quite easy math like that.  Subs work different in some countries like china so the (majority) of subscribers aren't paying $15 a month.
---
Not for Vanilla, if you look for guides 2 years ago you wont find too much. Now you find more every day because Classic makes ppl churn out info about literally which brick you should stand on in any boss fight
---
One thing I haven't liked about Blizzard is that you can post in the general forums and beta forums about the direction, game design, gameplay, etc. as many times as you want and the commentary there is simply ignored or casually explained away...until the light finally goes on for someone at Blizz and they are in a window where they could make a change.
---
Being a pvp'er I feel like many suggestions and feedback made were implemented 2-3 years after. 
---
Since beta feedback would be ignored, you'd post in general about some colossal bug or issue affecting balance. Then it would be ignored or fixed in a future content patch. Or it would be fixed in the next expansion (since they are all focusing on new content) but that expansion would have reworked/broken a hundred other things.
---
I disagree with sharding. Just do a queue. People have waited for years and they can wait a couple of days after release or a few hours to get through the queue to experience a single Azeroth.
---
Graphics toggle would be great as would barbershop. I think gbanks could affect things too much so I'd avoid them.
---
You have to buy the latest expansion though.... It's not included in the sub. That's what he means by box price.
---
When classic is released you'll have to pay for the game. 
---
If you have a wow sub already you'll have to pay for classic like a normal expansion on top of your current sub. 
---
By that point every moment you're not using any subscription service you're wasting money. Do you watch Netflix/Am.Prime 24/7? 
---
Even it could be used for stuff like a car (since even without using it there's taxes, insurance costs...) or a house...
---
This is a fallacy. 
---
I agree with every single point, but don't forget that TBC did do a some good things, one of them is they slightly pushed the nodge of tanking paladins and druids, and dps priests, among 
---
 others. Also, most lvl 70 talents added RPG and mechanic depth to classes, they felt very cool. 
---
You’re in for a treat.
---
The 100 million statistic is from before the release of the Warcraft movie. So, yeah. 
---
Thanks! Is this coefficient same for + healing and + spell power? 
---
It's true, black lotus is insanely rare. It doesn't matter though because you'll still be making tons more from Dreamfoil, Plaguebloom, and Gromsblood compared to Arcane Crystals which you only get some of the time you mine  a Rich Throium Vein.
---
Yes, those coefficients are for both damage and healing. +1 "damage and healing" will have the same effect as +1 healing on heals.
---
Discord during PUGS is like the add-on that a lot of n00bs used that used to /y 'HEAL ME, I NEED HEALS!'
---
There are some people who use voice appropriately, but TBH, I do not want to hear about your girlfriend's lack of a sex drive, your grades at school, your political views, and especially your finger-pointing and screaming at another player because *you* think he/she isn't playing the way that *you* would / do play the class.
---
What I want to hear is friendly chatter, laughter, maybe some chest-beating, but for GOD'S SAKE, you are NOT the BEST MAGE, TANK, WARRIOR, HEALER, ROGUE or HUNTARD on the server, and you really need to realize that playing WoW requires teamwork, especially in a dungeon, raid or BG.

As already said, he's doing both. :)

You're retarded dude
---
&gt;Being that the client will be based on 7.3.5 will the Classic addons need to be updated with every Retail update or will it remain static?
---
It will remain static obviously. Retail is currently on version 8.1. 
---
&gt;Will addons capabilities be based off of what was available in Vanilla or based off of modern WoW?
---
​We don't know yet. Blizzard has not told us. I think most people are guessing it will be a modified version of the 7.3.5 api. So mostly like retail but with some functions removed/added to line up better with what could and could not be done in Vanilla. 
---
&gt;Also, I am very interested in writing an addon myself but have never done it, so if anyone has any advice on how to get started I would be very grateful. 
---
I don't have any specific getting started guide to recommend, but I'm sure if you google for it you will find something. You can also just start by modifying an existing addon or stuff like that, depending on what works for you. They are written in LUA, and you can probably find API functions and such by googling. 
---
yes, but if you keep playing you pay for every expansion on release.  I quit at WotLK, but a friend kept playing, he now has bought 7 or 8? ,  I lost count,   full retail expansions + all the monthly fees. 
---
My prediction is that addons will absolutely FLOOD the market at launch. Either the original developer will come out of retirement to remake them (likely because they are playing classic) or copies will be made. And why? Money. The vast majority of these will ask/beg for donations and you can be sure they will want to take advantage of this huge influx of new players to make a quick buck. 
---
I would not worry about the state of addons. 
---
As for making your own addons, the best bet is to subscribe to retail and join a group or forum that details how to make them. Since classic will be using the same server tech and foundation of retail, best you learn that then going to a PS.
---
The 100 million figure came years before the movie. 
---
IIRC his 60-66 video had a lot more footage captured, but he lost it all. 
---
You know what also proved viable years ago? Music on CDs, the zipdrive for a short while, renting physical movies. We shouldnt throw ideas away because "its always worked that way"
---
I am asking about the studies. I would like to see what kind of test groups they asked and what the answers were. Not number of subscribers a few years ago.
---
This is so rad
---
it's good thing to be curious , young padawan.  always keep asking questions  and one day you might be wise too! 
---
Five raiders barge in, slinging spells and swinging swords to slaughter everyone in the place. A mage picks up her chapeau and places it on his head as he calmly walks out amongst a littering of bodies. Someone speaks up, “anyone wana do armory?”

I can certainly see how certain ones are inconveniencing, i would have preferred the current system to be a little cut down. Things like Loremaster, Conqueror and exalted faction achievements are great. What I find strange is the raid achievements. They didn't make in raid hardmodes after Sarth and Ulduar despite being popular due to how hard it would be. But then they came up with raid achievements for each boss which is almost the same..
---
Adding dungeon achievements is the only reason to go back once you have the gear.
---
A balance is needed!
---
What are you talking about? Using the abilities in the right way? As a frost mage, spam frostbolt and decurse. Use Blizzard to AoE. Don’t stand in fire. 
---
It’s an incredible casual and simple game compared with things like Starcraft, Counter Strike, Warcraft III etc.
---
Yes maybe some one came up with some unique talent built, or someone brought a shadow priest to their raid. But honestly how much “better” does that make you. 5%? It’s minor optimizations that have a small impact. It’s NOT enough difference to claim that people were useless and “knew nothing” in the past. 
---
About researching. I’m sure anyone who was semi-serious about raiding back then spend time on forums, played around with talent calculators, read boss review articles etc. It was mandatory in every PvE guild that made any kind of significant progress. 
---
Maybe we didn’t watch videos, but we sure did spend a lot of time reading and studying outside of the game. 
---
Anyway. I think it’s INSANELY exaggerated to claim that people were shit in the past and now others are way better. Small improvements, sure.
---
Significant changes (e.g., QoL changes) do not need to happen and will not happen in Classic WoW.  
---
If you want changes, there is a game for you. It’s called Current WoW (BFA).   
---
Otherwise, Blizzard’s Game Director has made it clear at Blizzcon 2018 that they intend to make an authentic recreation of WoW as it was in 2006 and changes that alter the game as it was in 2006 are outside the scope of this project. 
---
“Before we began any of these decisions, first and foremost, really is authenticity as our goal. We want to create an experience that feels just like 2006 WoW.  If someone was playing WoW in 2006 and they lay down and took a very, very long nap and woke up in 2019 and sat them in front of WoW Classic, it shouldn’t feel like an immediately different experience…it should feel like the game that you know."

WRT sharding, IMHO, it is a (cloud infrastructure) QoL change that will have a negative gameplay ripple effect and diminish community by turning us all into basically anonymous NPCs - just like we are today in ModernWoW - where no one cares about me and I don’t care about anyone.  
---
They claim it will be temporary but I can’t see how it will be, since any zone that has load (e.g., cities) will also have load and therefore use sharding for the same reason they want to use it in starting zones (load balancing).   
---
Appearing/disappearing like anonymous ghosts is definitely not authentic 2006 Vanilla WoW.  
---
That's completely fair, the complaints at the time where huge. Our guild had only managed a few hard modes when ToC came out and just replaced everthing
---
5 million subs? You are dreaming. Its 2 million or probably less. China's WoW market is basically dead, since WoD.
---
They always cosplay humans and nelfs. It's discrimination against gnomes I say! 
---
Maybe that was their plan. But its their fault, everyone who played the Alpha and Beta knew that the Game sucks ass and we all told Blizzard that - they just ignored it!
---
You will be able to do almost all of the quests he can, if not all of them. There may be a few right at the start that only Tauren can do.
---
I don’t think there are any race-specific quests in classic, so go for it. Mind that class-specific quests still exist in classic.
---
Which I'll probably hit level 2 with travel experience anyways. Thanks!
---
wow, the guy that priced that knows his shit.   my local store would put that at 0,50 or 1,- at most, being a old looking random plastic toy 
---
I know this is a shot in the dark, but any chance that somebody has a picture of one of these signed collectors editions to share with everybody else?
---
You definitely can and it’s quite simple to do. You literally just stay on the main roads and you can make it to Mulgore in a short run. Mulgore has very little traffic as well due to only Taurens starting there.
---
I don’t even recall any quests being Tauren only, but if they are, it can’t be more than one or two.
---
Oh yeah, to be honest I can’t remember which effects were vanilla and which ones were TBC except that falling to your death was gnomish, burning was goblin, getting turned into a chicken was gnomish TBC and races change was goblin TBC. 
---
During vanilla gnomish was clearly the way to go but this was made up in TBC where goblin was clearly better, not least because gnomish polymorph could easily kill you as a horde player, netherstorm was just a more useful location and to cap it, the goblin engineering trinket could be used in arena where the gnomish one could not. 
---
Note sure why any would downvote you, this is a legit problem for ppl in school etc (at least it was for me back in the days)
---
But when i look at my pile of shame steam library (games bought but never touched) I have come to terms with video games like that: for every hour I put into a game I am okay spending 1€. Thus if I pay a retail price of 50 bucks I consider it worth the money if i get to 2 days /played. Same for subscription, if i play 13 hours a month for 13€ s i consider it worth. Your “break even point“ might be an other if you dont have regular income but still everyone can find some number that works for them.
---
Agreed, but the way blizz releases content 31 days after a patch is a bit ridiculous...
---
Specifically why I aim to do mulgore instead of durotar, less people. Thanks!
---
I love the troll/orc earth stone. You walk up this little path and think you're gonna end up in some enclosed space, but then you get an amazing view of Ratchet. Must've been magical for people who just started out. 
---
Sharding is still an open question, but sharding has little to do with how you might enjoy the first 10 levels or so. I've leveled a troll and I didn't much care for Durotar, so I might make the run regardless of whether early zones have sharding or not.
---
"Some" is an extremely small share, and likely not worth the effort to support. It may be a good idea to have a system like $2 hour rate capping at the standard $15/mo. That doesn't mean its worth supporting the very few that system would draw in. 
---
I haven’t played in 5 years but when I did it was  fun. I played non stop for about 3 months and then got bored. With whatever content they’ve put out since then, I’m sure it would last you 6 months until classic. 
---
Bfa bad
---
Yes, I love mulgore regardless too. Even if I was ud warrior I'd make the travel
---
&gt;As a frost mage, spam frostbolt and decurse. Use Blizzard to AoE. Don’t stand in fire.
---
It's a bit more than that in PvP. 
---
&gt;Yes maybe some one came up with some unique talent built, or someone brought a shadow priest to their raid. But honestly how much “better” does that make you. 5%? It’s minor optimizations that have a small impact. It’s NOT enough difference to claim that people were useless and “knew nothing” in the past.
---
If we are talking PvE. The fact that rogues and fury warriors had a hit cap they should reach was not common knowledge back in the day. The average warrior probably just tried stacking strength, or crit if you were lucky. It makes a massive difference. Same can probably be said about spell hit for casters, although I don't know how much that affects damage. 
---
&gt;About researching. I’m sure anyone who was semi-serious about raiding back then spend time on forums, played around with talent calculators, read boss review articles etc. It was mandatory in every PvE guild that made any kind of significant progress.
---
We are talking about the "normal" or "average" player. Not serious raiders. 
---
But even the top raiders did not optimize nearly as well as the top raiders today does. Although in that case, yes, I agree it's not a big difference. The big difference is with the average player, who back in vanilla was pretty damn shit. Today they are still pretty shit compared to the best players. But the reason they fail now is because they play badly (ie. just spamming frost bolt and not standing in fire is not enough any more), not because they don't know what they should do, at least not most of the time. Or if we are talking about private vanilla servers, then the average player is actually pretty decent in PvE. PvP is another story though. 
---
Oh wow, did they delete his channel outright? Damn
---
Comparing the server load of capital cities to starting zones at launch is not accurate. Launch day will have tons of players who won't even make it to a capital city.
---
Go for it, you can run south west out of the valley of trials to ratchet and then always stay on the road. Mulgore is most likely less populated and there are no race specific quests i am aware of. Be sure to get the flight points in ratchet and XR on your way
---
Are you sure about that?
---
My understanding was that for classic will be included in the sub. No "Classic Expansion" purchase required.
---
It didn’t immediately become terrible at the mid point in Wrath. But that is when the decay began. It was still largely the same game up until the end of Wrath. 
---
It's still an example of such a number being inflated and inaccurate. How many of those accounts are owned by singular people. Multiboxing? Banned accounts being replaced? Cheaters buying multiple game copies/accounts? People buying accounts for RAF mounts?
---
They all serve to bloat and inflate the perceived player base, just like you can't count total active characters today to estimate the current sub count because there's no knowing how many characters individual players have.
---
Anyway OP, your working is grossly inflated and I doubt classic will hit the numbers you're expecting. It'll be surprising sure, but I just don't think it'll be that insane 
---
I raid primarily so I can get better gear for PvP. 
---
&gt;  I can't shake this feeling that something is going to go wrong.
---
Good for you! This is healthy and it means that you cant be very disappointed ;) I try to have reasonable expectations myself but it's hard. I'm super hyped.
---
For me its +-100%. And I think that number was 150k, but I don't remember exactly
---
My guess is that they will use the same core but branch after that. There are many systems baked deep into the engine that are vastly different between retail and classic, its not like you simply dont show the dialog for lfg and stuff like sharding is more than an entry in a config file.
---
The demo was based on the legion client since that is what they had at the time they made the demo, nevertheless they will make changes to the server logic both clients need to “understand“.
---
Even assuming that number isn't an ass pull, it bet it also doesn't count the people who have quit every expansion and come back just before the next.  I have personally quit retail about 8 times.
---
I'm not sure where you're getting your ideas about mmo demographics, but the people who have studied these demographics have come to very different conclusions. The typical mmo player has been/is an adult with a full-time job; teenagers and the unemployed are the minority. 
---
https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130552/unmasking_the_avatar_the_.php?print=1
---
I'd also be curious to know how you came to the conclusion that general video gaming has an attrition rate of 75% over a 10+ year period. If that were true, expanding the gaming industry at the rate that it has grown probably would have been impossible. The Entertainment Software Association reports that nearly 3/4 of gamers are over 18, and the average age is 35. I've never seen any data that suggests that huge numbers of people just suddenly stop gaming as they enter adulthood.
---
http://www.theesa.com/article/2017-essential-facts-computer-video-game-industry/
---
They still developed classic with 7.3 as a base. Just because you launch it from the same window as you launch 8.whatever doesn't change anything. 
---
PTR is a different version of the game than live, you know. 
---
It's not just building your character. Everything is so streamlined by now. When you level a character there is basically no point in exploring. You enter a area and get directed from one quest to the next and most of these quest a designed in a way that requires a very specific solution. 
---
Sure the presentation is better and maybe the quests are less repetitive but it almost feels like the game is playing itself. You basically only have to run from one map marker to the next and do whatever basic task you are expected to do. If you do not diverge from that path there is also little risk in dying, let alone failing a quest. 
---
NO, 100 million ACCOUNTS have been made. 100 million unique people have not made one account each. Hell I’ve made 7 myself.

Alliance priests got it way better with the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus.

Telekom, monopoly of German internet architecture, is dancing while doing *nothing* at all in the country. They aren't laying down more fiber and instead push their vectoring crap that doesn't work reliably, their support is horrible, they own almost all of the wires going through the country and other companies basically have to buy those off of them for ludicrous prices.
---
When the goverment gave them *billions* a few years ago to "improve" the internet, they *meant* to lay down fiber. They didn't specify, so Telekom took the money and didn't do anything out of the ordinary.
---
Dancing on the government's nose as a german saying goes is pretty much as "whatever you want and get away with it" as it gets. That's precisely why monopolies are an issue. 
---
There's many more examples. Comcast in America was notorious for doing pretty much the same thing, Intel didn't do anything to advance the CPU market for a long time because they held a monopoly and are only now starting to see competition by AMD, the list goes on.
---
I’m at the age where I’m upvoting almost any “back in my day... uphill both ways” comment. 
---
You're missing my point a little. I was just using that as a quick example that came to mind. I am fully aware what the problem lfr is, and I agree with you on that. However the feature was introduced to serve more casual players, who claim they don't have time to find groups for dungeons or whatever. A change that was blatantly going to take the game in the wrong direction. Flying mounts on the other hand was just an awesome feature which inadvertently took the game in the wrong direction. 
---
Incredibly well articulated video, best explanation of this issue yet.
---
you never know. smash melee still has a robust, dedicated competitive scene due to the quality of its gameplay. 
---
Why would they do that though? I'm not entirely sure how this shit works. But wouldn't that require them to do extra work on the classic client every time they update retail? Which seems excessive since classic doesn't ever need to be patched except for potential security issues. Why not just keep it locked on whatever version they started development on (ie. 7.3)?
---
&gt;There haven't been any new dungeons since release
---
There have been several new dungeons released with LWS1 episodes, but they were temporary and were revamped as fractals (5-man dungeons with random affixes) later. Starting from HoT, fractals mostly replaced dungeons as endgame content and they regularly add new ones.
---
You can go to addon's page and send a pm to creator or join discord or w/e else they have, suggesting/asking to port it    
---
I checked out Consoleport discord to see if its getting ported and there was already a sticky saying it will be no problem porting it  
---
How does that relate to MMORPG's and microtransactions, lol wtf xD
---
There is no phone in that picture, don't you have a phone? 
---
Lol bro chill tf out on this
---
There is nothing stopping you from grinding for more gold. Your character isn't frozen in time. Does it suck? Yeah, but the character is still fully playable if you want to come back.
---
You have 28 bank slots and 7 bag slots with 18 (I think) possible slots per bag.
---
You could bank 154 of any item, plus 16 from your backpack and a maximum of 72 from your bags, meaning you can carry 88 and bank 154, for a total of 242, although it is unlikely you would have literally no other items.
---
This means if you filled one guildie's bank with boe epics, which vary in value and I'll assume they average 5 gold vended and you can't AH them for more (even though you probably could, at least in the very early days of TBC) this means that this inventory would be worth nearly 1250 gold in TBC on day 1, which could then be given to every guildie.
---
Part of the problem of estimating worth here is that you'd want to AH the items and in an environment with this much duplication it is difficult to predict the AH value of anything.
---
It isn't really a fear of any single item being too valuable, so much as the bulk of semi-valuable stuff that could be duplicated.
---
Lol dude chill out. We all love classic and I’m hype too but it’s not going to blow the fucking world away
---
Well, I'm all ears. So what made classic WoW so great 
---
I agree to most of this. WotLK had his up's and downs, but it was the last expansion i enjoyed. I quitted shortly after cata pre patch, used my 3 days trial to every expansion but never came back. I liked Naxx, Ulduar and ICC (we don't speak of that tournament). The reasons why they killed it are discussed often enough in this sub.
---
Something definitely did rise...

TL;DR: It's a very fun game in its own right, very different from the other big 3 - namely FFXIV, WoW and ESO. Raids aren't everything in it, and it's more story and overworld focused, and there's no vertical gear progression, but still loads of content and fun classes. I recommend it for sure.
---
If you can get past the cash shop having lots of cosmetics, it has tons of content, both single player and group based. World completion is tons of fun IMO, the mounts are awesome and actually provide gameplay, classes are varied and thanks to 1 baseline and 2 elite specializations basically have 3 very distinct playstyles and the world is beautiful.
---
While the raids don't get lots of updates, and Fractal releases aren't that frequent either, there's tons of other stuff constantly released. It's *not* a WoW clone at all, and if you treat it as a Raiding PVE Themepark game you'll be disappointed, but in its own right it is a fantastic game that shows that you can still do fun things with the genre.
---
There's also almost no vertical gear progression akin to WoW. A raid won't drop Tier 1 loot to prepare you for the next raid, which drops Tier 2 loot. There's Exotic, then Ascended gear, which you can get fairly easily in theory, and then you're pretty much done. Legendaries also exist, but they're minor stat upgrades over Ascended gear, but they have the advantage of 1) looking fantastic and 2) allowing you to swap the stats on them to suit your current build.
---
Common criticisms of the game are that Raiding is very hit or miss for people, as you only have 1 real difficulty and thus people are afraid of getting into it (GW2s community is as casual as it gets, with people claiming that needing 1 hour of playtime to complete something is *ludicrous*. You're free to form your own opinion on that.), Fractals are *very* short dungeons and the traditional dungeons the game has were pretty much abandoned as content, with no new ones being added, and the content releases are, as mentioned before, not focused on hard endgame PVE content, and more on story and overworld stuff. Crafting also isn't all that useful anymore sadly, as most people make gold otherwise, but you *can* for sure craft gear yourself if you're so inclined, even Legendaries.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Do we know if Green Lens of Stamina or Green Lens of Agility will be available to be crafted? They originally became unavailable to be created after patch 1.3.0, but my future 39 twink would love to have one once vanilla re-launches.
---
I clicked ALL of my spells, and moved with the arrow keys. Made it to about level 45 as a druid, and was mad I kept dying to everything. I never used feral form, and mostly just Entangled rooted + moonfire + auto attacked it with my gray staff. I didnt learn about WSAD until quite awhile after playing. 
---
Well, BG's impact on world PvP doesn't change the fact that flying mounts is a bane to wPvP. Being able to fly is just too handy an escape.
---
As for BG's, then we are talking during Vanilla. Yes, there was the "epic" world PvP before BG's, but that was just because it was the *only* form of PvP. Adding BG's (and later systems) did of course take away a lot of wPvP, but then you have to consider if it is a problem. If people play BG's rather than wPvP it means people like BG's more. It sucks for those who hate BG's and only want to wPvP, but it is a player choice. That is, of course, ignoring that you can farm honor in BG's which means some people just do BG's as a way to farm rank, but I'd say the majority likes BG's. 
---
Personally I never liked large scale PvP battles. Spamming stuff is boring, the fun part of such battles are the organizing and following a commander. I did do it in GW2 for a while, but it gets old pretty fast imo. This leaves the only fun wPvP (which I do love) as random roaming and ganking, the later not being super fun to me. BG's allows me to queue and relatively fast get some PvP action, especially nice for people with limited time to spend on WoW (and you already have a lot of other things you "need" to do in order to progress your character).
---
Let's calculate a "player" then. 
---
I'm pretty sure you can have up to a maximum of 7 WoW licenses on a battle.net account and even trial accounts do count as "world of warcraft accounts" so 1 player can own 7 accounts, or 1:7 (worst case scenario, since we all know most players would own 1 license) 
---
Now, the 100,000,000 number, lets be generous and say that only 1/4 or 25% of those accounts belong to players that actually paid a sub fee. 
---
With that being said, 25 million / 7 in a worst case scenario would be 3,571,428 real players in a worst case scenario.
---
Now, with a more reasonable ratio of players to accounts (not unrealistic like 1:7) and instead using something generous like 1:3
---
25 million / 3 = 8,333,333 players at launch. 
---
Lets see here, if everytime they get a pop against for example your team, and every time they dodge your team. Then its not that big a leap to conclued they are intentionally dodging to avoid your team, which you can then ban them for.
---
Its not hard.
---
&gt;I just want

As the president of the USA said: Sounds good, doesn't work. BFA is so riddled with problems that only fixing 1 thing wouldn't work. While I do agree that talent trees were fun and allowed for hybrid builds, niche builds and just interesting decisionmaking on top of giving you something to look forward to level per level, BFA has many more issues on top of that.
---
It's buggy (Used to be that at the beginning of BFA every single M+ was bugged and most raidbosses were bugged, too, some even so dramatically that you couldn't complete em), classes are pretty much as simple as they get, they also all play eerily similar to one another with a few standout examples that were also simplified because we can't have players actually have fun with more compelx playstyles, now can we? Not speaking from a Vanilla PoV but compared to even Legion and in Vanilla classes atleast had unique toolsets, whereas with BFA they were simple and not even unique. Great.
---
On top of that, the RNG bullshit was increased, with titanforging *still* being a thing, Azerite being a horrible mechanic, Tiersets, Artifact weapons, netherlight crucible and Artifact Traits on top of Legendaries all being stripped away from you at once in its place which is a horrible trade off AND the GCD change rubs a bit of salt in the wound that basically now covers the entire surface area of this game, it's not even funny how many problems this expansion has.
---
And the devs are being greedier and greedier, with them releasing raids 1 month after the actual content patch under the guise of them wanting you to *have time to experience that content*. Right, funny that a sub lasts 1 month, so that if you subbed for the patch, and wanna raid, you'll need to sub a month earlier basically.
---
Leveling got made a bit slower with Legion which I, for one, am actually in favor of since leveling is a part of WoW in my opinion, but with the class design that basically stops giving you *any* sense of progress past 80, that kind of just sucks all the fun out of it once you reach that level.
---
Can you source your numbers? Thanks. 
---
Wow cool, an illidan toy! 
---
You are telling me to "chill out" on a 10 hour old post. Who's the idiot here. 
---
Lol obviously not me, this thread is all you spouting your momentary hype. Also you’re acting like my comment is time specific, have a good day man.

---
There you go. You could've found it if you had the reading comprehension to look at the thread first. 
---
&gt;You dont understand what a monopoly is.
---
I answered what a monopoly is. It does not relate to MMORPG's and microtransactions directly, correct. It answers to *your* message. 
---
You can't do queue in this age, you are out of touch with reality  
---
people would be furious  
---
Those say that 100 million ACCOUNTS have been made, not unique players. Please source THESE numbers, "...lets be generous and say that only 1/4 or 25% of those accounts belong to players that actually paid a sub fee.
---
25 million / 3 = 8,333,333 players at launch."
---
Just anecdotal from my peer group. None of us play games like we did 10 years ago. The odd game or 3 of battlefield perhaps but not 6 hours of wow a night.
---
I think I understand your point, I just used LFR as an example too. I'll try to elaborate a bit, I might not have been fully clear myself.
---
The point I'm making is that having limited amount of time to play and being casual are not the same thing, at least not in my eyes. Sure they are related, like how a really hardcore gamer will spend a lot of time playing, but just because you have a job, family etc. and can't play too much doesn't mean you are a casual. If you raid high end or you do super well in PvP I wouldn't call you casual regardless of "only" playing 2 hours a day.
---
So with that in mind I'd say all those features we talk about does *not* cater to casuals, but to people with a more limited time for WoW. This is great for many people. Personally I can't wait for Classic, but being a university student I do wonder if I will even be able to progress much with the time I have. It sucks to for example know you can do well in PvP but you get stomped because you haven't got time to farm raids for gear.
---
And as for the flying mounts, I agree they are a cool feature, but you cannot deny the impact on wPvP. it didn't single handly destroy it, but it does mean if you have the mobiity to get just enough distance to mount up you are fully safe and it did mean people couldn't jump on you when you were on a mount like if it was on the ground. Especially the last part means you can only attack people who are doing something like questing and thus aren't flying up in the skies.
---
i didn't said that wow is gonna last for ever. what ideas are thrown away? 14 years for a subscription based game is more than music cds :).
---
you're not asking about studies. you're grappling on conflict. you don't need to see anything, the result is right there, 14 years price unchanged.
---
you can clearly see over the years that population fluctuate based on content and not money. after years of being used to disappointment, subscribers still come back at launches and then leave because they don't find what they want not because the price is too high, low, whatever. and furthermore, despite the fact that the game disappoints, is still [cashing](https://massivelyop.com/2018/05/03/actiblizz-q1-2018-financial-report-wow-is-actually-outperforming-expectations-time-for-a-fourth-yacht-or-no/) [in](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-third-quarter-2018-financial).
---
also i don't think you can handle the kind of test groups they asked and what the answers were.
---
another bad news is that you're getting down-voted. damn, sad sunday, huh?
---
&gt;So I predict that around 5% of WoW's user base number of people will have a serious interest in Classic. 
---
Now who's being unrealistic. 
---
Yeah talentTrees  won’t fix BFA. I just chose to mention Talent trees because they were an early casualty of blizzards attempt to stream line the game. I don’t think taking out talent trees is a minor thing. People say “what’s the big deal? They are just taking away your ability to decide the way you want to build your character, and making decisions for you.”Taking away a players ability to customize their character in RPG is a Huge fucking deal. Individuality, making your character unique to you, is a pillar of RPGs. 
---
Didn't you know? Once a post hits the 10 hour mark it's immediately immune to criticism. 
---
TIL once a post hits the 10 hour mark it's immediately immune to criticism. 
---
I’ve been considering starting in another zone as well
---
Mainly for reputation / mount purposes!
---
Well, no, it's just kinda stupid to continue to add new replies to someone that has very clearly made many many replies in the thread previously. 
---
This is a good write up. Thanks for the information. I may check it out. I think I'm so used to the mold of tradition holy trinity style MMOs.
---
sitting in city and wasting time spamming instead of playing the damn game is just bad design or made on purpose to prolong "play" time (sub time)  
---
Its miserable experience, no wonder people want to avoid it with discord and alike  
---
they should just implement the group finder that was introduced in WoD, best of both worlds and a golden middle. No shitty /2 spam nor shitty RDF  
---
Don't think it will be problem for people that dont use VC because vanilla is just tank n spank for the most part  
---
You need to settle down bud lol
---
Wow that's one heck of a generalization. Everyone was keyboard turning and didn't have key bindings???? And vurtne was not the biggest mage trend setter. Just one of the names that came out of vanilla.  
---
There was no or little youtube back then. We downloaded everything. 
---
Damn didn’t notice that, lame :/
---
The 7.3.5 freeze might just be a development thing. It's not uncommon for developers to freeze the versions of 3rd party software they use while they implement their own systems. That way they know that any bugs that arise are likely a result of their own code; not from a transition to a new dependency. Once you have your system in decent shape, you often start integrating 3rd party patches to your own code for security, performance, and new features.
---
Depending on how closely coupled the clients are. We might see the occasional patch alongside a modern update. And even vice-versa if Classic requires a back-end change.
---
They probably won't be available. According to what Blizzard has stated, they don't have complete game data backed up from very long before the final patch of vanilla, 1.12.1. So currently they don't plan on doing progressive itemization, which means all items will be as they were in patch 1.12.1
---
I'm gonna say something that I shouldn't -- but this was one of my experiences on a private server.  There were players on these servers who had alts in almost every single guild on the server -- not to play with the guild members, not to raid with the guild members, but to sometimes login and create havoc; and/or to broadcast the attempts at bosses in BWL / ZG / MC /AQ and NAXX.
---
That was their gig, their fun, and the way they played WoW.  They didn't take the knowledge that a young tank or dps didn't understand the fight and to offer to help the guild learn / change techniques -- they did it for the laughs and giggles.
---
It actually wasn't done to help the community or to help the guild(s), it was pretty much a malicious attack on those players, broadcast to those of the guild who logged into listen, with laughs, sarcastic comments, and later taunts about 'failing' to members of that guild.
---
Don't worry, I can be as cut and dried, sarcastic, and brutal when I need to be to another player.  But it's not done in public, it's either done in private chat, in a private room on Discord / Vent -- but it's never done in public.  It's just not good business to call out the short-comings of either another guild member and/or community member in public.
---
So I began to do a little exploration, and found this to be happening with more than one guild -- when joining the guild, the password information for voice communication is passed out -- and it's never changed, and/or housekeeping of inactive players isn't completed, meaning they could log in, grab the changed password and log right back out with no questions asked.
---
A lot of you will say... "I don't care!" because maybe you think you won't be on the receiving end of this type of gamesmanship.  But I've seen it happen to ONE of the Vanilla streamer guilds, a few of the EU guilds on Nost, and on a lot of guilds who were just experiencing BWL or AQ for the first time.
---
I'm not asking for the spirit of competition to be taken out of raiding; I'm just worried what this type of gamesmanship might to do server communities.  Dirty laundry used to be aired out on the server forums, and many raiding guilds use the "no drama, mama" enforcement.  But now instead of on the forums, it's being broadcast -- not only to the guilds, but sometimes on Youtube and in several instances, Twitch.
---
We've all laughed at the published fails of "Moar DOTZ!" and seen the "Rag Fail @1%" video, and shared the heart-attack / loss at that attempt.  
---
If your guild uses Discord, clean up the guild membership and change the passwords often.  When our guild went to Vent for raiding in AQ40 and Naxx, the password was changed weekly.  Now, when we PVP'd and wanted to have old guildmates join / and/or listen to the real sounds of the Alliance players as they were PWND on the battle field, it was open and friendly.
---
But just a warning.  Nothing defeats a guild faster than having several failed attempts; and knowing that many others heard it happen and laughed.
---
Go both but save the herbs for later.
---
Hah oh
---
Lies!!!
---
There is no objective source which details the breakdown of what "World of Warcraft accounts" means anywhere on the internet or that has ever been released by Blizzard. The information required to make objective figures would be a battle.net account breakdown. Which has never been released; therefore the best anyone can do is make an educated guess by factoring in obvious facts such as "Trial accounts will vastly outnumber subscribed accounts"
---
Taking away 75% of all accounts like this was generous. Unless anyone is assuming that 75%+ of all World of Warcraft accounts prior to 2014 were trial accounts.
---
...If 95% of all world of warcraft accounts created were trial accounts, and the ratio of player = 1:7 = accounts still applied. 
---
5000000 / 7 = 71,000 active players at launch of Classic WoW
---
...But an educated guess would tell you that in the current game, most players will own 1-3 world of warcraft accounts. so 5,000,000 /3 is 1,666,666 active players at the launch of Classic WoW
---
If you have any more things you'd like to factor in; or if you can find an objective source from Blizzard of battle.net account breakdowns that'd be nice information to use; but as far as I'm aware - it does not exist. 
---
As for the personal attacks, you do you. 
---
I'm very settled; thanks.
---
No way these chicks actually play this game on any kind of decent level. Cool costume and all though.
---
Yeah, just saw that other thread here. Still don't understand why it would be easier doing it that way, but doesn't matter. It's the same effect, we will have retail addons ported to classic, not vanilla addons. So if you are going to develop addons for classic, you should practice on retail, not vanilla or whatever. 
---
I'm really curious how long the population will last, how many will take the nostalgia for a few months then quit.
---
I don't feel one was worse than another. I feel like they were two sides of the same gold piece. Dungeon finder killed the community, while arenas led to the death of class identity, and a general homogenization of all the classes.
---
Ok, I predict that the number will be r/classicwow subscribers divided by r/wow subscribes multiplied by the number of WoW subscribers, *at the release* of Classic WoW. :) (Because the numbers will surely change until then.)
---
It still doesn't change the "few hundred thousand Classic players" after the tourists have left prediction, which is what will happen.
---
Of course you are free to believe whatever you want. I'll just play the game. :)
---
&gt;I don’t think taking out talent trees is a minor thing
---
Me neither, I guess I just wanted to rant on BFA a bit as it just has *so many* issues, even if you fixed one of the major ones there'd still be oh so many left, even if you enjoy the modern ideas of WoW.
---
And I do agree on taking away customization being a big deal, absolutely. Yes, there will *always* be a best build, but just because you *can* min/max doesn't mean that you should get rid of ALL customization, that's just lazy and obviously why Blizz went this route: It's easier.
---
Talent choices allow for fun, weird things to happen. There's 5 ways to play Warlocks well in Wotlk, not 3. All of them offer *something*, either support, good DPS or fun, weird playstyles. Is 1 of them the best? Absolutely, but besides the fact that you can absolutely balance this stuff properly, it doesn't even matter.
---
People forget that games are, beside optimization, allowed to be **FUN**. Everything *needing* to be balanced in a PVE scenario is just such a weird concept to me, and I hate the idea of every class being perfectly balanced. You know what perfect balance would be like? Only having 1 class with 0 customization. That's when balance works. Even now in BFA with its basically non-existant customization, numbers still don't magically balance out:
---
[Uldir DPS numbers for mythic 75th perc.](https://i.imgur.com/03b9bOW.png)
---
This is not perfect, it's a 10% difference. That's actually pretty good balance wise, but players will *always* complain about balance, even if all the numbers are almost identical. 
---
As such...Might as well have some fun. Have unique mechanics, fuck the notion of "Bring the player, not the class" and give us some RPG in our MMORPG if you're already making the first part of the acronym as optional as possible, thanks a lot.
---
When a mechanic has to be disabled for the majority of an expansion you know there's something inherently wrong with it. I think developers should have found some middle ground for flying mounts somewhere between "Nonexistent" and "So overpowered they can't exist."
---
Who started the personal attacks? I could've sworn it was you when you said I lack reading comprehension! Which is ironic considering you either willfully or ignorantly ignored my original question.
---
This is ridiculous lmao look we're all hyped but this is just retarded. You're 'educated' guesses don't factor in a myriad of important statistical data that is a google search away. It doesn't factor in any literal numbers except 100 million ACCOUNTs (not players) and it's, at best, a grade 7 math exam equation. It's embarrassing tbh.
---
Do you account for the economic differentiation between 2004/2006 and now? Did you account for job growth? Job decline? Economic mobility differentials? Free-to-play game markets? Mobile markets? PC gaming hardware trends? Like, you literally just took the number of accounts made YEARS ago, said 'lmao let's make low guesses so I can't get called out on shitty data' and spewed this garbage.
---
Morons like you give this community such a bad wrap. Please fuck off back to retail where you don't have to use your brain, I think Classic is far too much for you.
---
After watching a lot of pvp videos on youtube I have determined they never fail!
---
In that case, they might as well copy the whole server. Srsly. Would be less of a headache and no one could cheat the system.
---
And you could progress and return to an forever Vanilla Server without any form of punishment.
---
Spell hit doesnt affect damage. Just your ability to hit. Resistances diminish damage. There is gear for lowering spell resistances in later raids (aq onward)
---
Actually I'm not sure anymore cause spells always hit, spell hit might be for raids only since they're level 63, let's hope someone who knows comes in for both our sakes
---
I thought you couldn’t stream Pservers on Twitch?  
---
Well as I have done in literally every other reply, we know that 100,000,000+ accounts have stopped playing WoW. 
---
We know that a high percentage (such as 95%~ (+?) ) of those accounts were owned by bots, were trials, gold-sellers, players that don't want to come back, players that don't care about WoW and never did. 
---
We also know that 1 player can own multiple world of warcraft accounts within the same battle.net account, excluding in the time period prior to battle.net. 
---
If each player owned 3 world of warcraft accounts, then we could say that 5,000,000 players (5% of 100m) /3 =  1,666,666 players at the launch of Classic. 
---
if then, the tourists did leave in 2 months. the Classic sub numbers would fall to around 416,666
---
You could factor many other things into this equation; but the "real numbers" haven't been released by Blizzard (In the form of a battle.net account breakdown) So all anyone could do is make a logical factor-based equation. 
---
Basing the total population on Classic as a facet of a WoW subreddit isn't logical. 
---
I really have no sympathy. They know they can't do it, they do it anyways and **most importantly they aren't doing it low key and list themselves under freaking WoW**  and then are surprised when they get banned.
---
Big difference between streaming for a small group and cutting into what Blizzard sees as lost profits and Blizzard has let a lot of the people they KNOW are streaming get away with it when they are under the radar.
---
To be honest these people are morons. North could make a mage guide on youtube with leveling tactics, talents, pvp stuff and turn that into a streaming career when Classic comes. Instead he sticks Blizzard with a stick and is surprised they stuck back. MN could do the same, but instead these people waste their lives ranking on servers that will have a dead pop in a few months.
---
This is coming from someone who likes North, likes MN and who is super critical of Blizzard and who calls out everything they are trying to pass off as no changes that can ruin the game as BS. I'm no Blizzard shill, but come on man. Be smarter than. North should say you were right, I'm sorry and maybe they will lift it when Classic comes. If people attack them over the ban? Good luck with that.  
---
You've got levels 1-60 to practice. Go in blind and around level 30 look up things on youtube to optimize! Talk to other warlocks in your guild. Dont sweat it! 
---
Preach makes good content in general. He's got some classic videos that, while not perfect, deserve a watch. 
---
you can't, hence the bans. Now people are angry they cared enough.
---
They aren't going to change server logic. They will translate vanilla into retail pieces. Square peg, meet round hole. What we get isn't going to be vanilla or pserver. It'll be classic. 
---
Yeah as I said somewhere else. BDO got really greedy and wrecked their own game. Greed is killing the entire industry atm. I don't think there has ever been a bigger divide between the suits at the game companies and the fans. It's sad to see. With Blizzard I think it hurt more because they used to be gamers that made games. 
---
Totally disregard literally everything I said after I put you in your place and reply with a one word comment? Yep, just like I thought lmao 
---
I’m in Total agreement with you. I was just highlighting talent trees. I can’t understand people just overlooking that, calling it minor and about balance Nothing needs to be balanced perfectly, perfect balance is the enemy of fun. However every class need to be viable In it’s own way. I think that is something that was done best in TBC and WOTLK. 
---
Honestly much better and far more accurate interpretation than Waifumane (what I called her) from HotS.
---
Does this anime spank bank shit have anything to do with the original NPC? [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/28/fd/a2/28fda2012d0293f41803967cedb77fcf.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/28/fd/a2/28fda2012d0293f41803967cedb77fcf.jpg)
---
Middle bottom was Nostarialious' last moments before shut down. I've heard that was the first **real** private server that was blizz-like and bug free.
---
Try watching the video without shedding a tear.
---
You should be able to do all the quests except for the main storyline leading through all of mulgore. (might only be the last one that is tauren only but i am not 100% sure)
---
This point about nostalgia being the only reason people want to play vanilla again is off the mark. 
---
WoW was a an industry redefining game, the most successful MMORPG of all time and at the time of its release this success wasn't because people were nostalgic. It was because the game itself was a fantastic experience, made with love by gamers for gamers. 
---
Many folks playing again want to go back to that. And I forsee many new players trying the game out as a "why not" only to become absorbed in the world  like we all were.
---
Hold on. Just because we were relying on forums and video downloads  instead of youtube doesn't mean the exact same info wasnt out there. 
---
Also take some things with a grain of salt. Its a private server. 
---
Sexist much?
---
Salty that an abusive person in my life threw mine out. Would have been novel memory to hang up somewhere. Spent the best days of my childhood on that game. Pff who needs sentiment anyway.
---
If you live in EU you'll be better off playing on an EU server or lag will be a serious problem.
---
As for language, English servers are always the most populated, what to play is up to you.
---
I live in EU too and I'm not English but I've been playing on English servers for many years. You'll meet people from all over Europe, that's a big plus for me.
---
Your English doesn't need to be perfect, many people speak it as second or third language, you just have to be able to communicate decently.
---
You'll also meet people from your own country and sometimes there are also non-English speaking guilds if that's what you really want.
---
arcane/frost mage if you want to be able to blow up a group of players. Warlock if you want to just dot people and get damage that way, but people prefer mages for AOE bombs in battlegrounds and the quick group pressure a mage can provide.
---
WoD baby spotted
---
How the Mighty have fallen 
---
Nostalgia is a meme, no one is on Private servers for nostalgia. Classic WoW was made at a time when companies weren’t obsessed with catering to retards. The game is just properly made. 
---
Ban them for what? Dodging is toxic but its not illegal.
---
If you choose not to join a BG you are free to do that.
---
It would be like banning someone for tagging mobs you wanted.
---
The only way to fairly manage dodging is by changing the mechanics that allow you to dodge, bit by punishing something perfectly permitted within the mechanics. 
---
2019 is gonna look a lot emptier than that when they phase people out :/
---
Yeah i have no doubt it will work out well for Classic, just that all the arguments against pay by the hour is easily dismantled. It seems like there really is no argument other than "always been like this", and im fine with that. Then its just your opinion and i dont really care about that at all.
---
 Yeah, "news" to be downvoted on wowclassic sub when you bring forth a new idea about payment method.
---
I see your point, maybe its not a viable thing to develop such a feature if the income is small. Great point.
---
They’ve basically said they don’t want to maintain two separate MMOs. 
---
So yes. I would expect they would use the same core client. 
---
I wouldn’t be shocked if they launched on a slightly older client and used dev time in the first few months after launch to get their version equivalent to retail. But long term that really is the only sane option. 
---
Based on recent changes to the WoW install folder (they added a “_retail_” sub folder and moved *everything* for the retail client under that) I don’t think both games will run on the same binaries and will have separate executables, wtf folders, etc. 
---
Damage isn't tracked in the vanilla wow BG panel. Only killing blows.
---
im done
---
nostalrius had over 800k accounts and 150k active players.
---
it takes 2 seconds to google something in 2019 btw.
---
The 2019 blizzard vanilla will be no where as nice as nost was. I really want it to be good (not perfect) but some what good... but the blizzard today is not the basket I’ll be putting all my eggs in..:( 
---
Yes, it's not technically a monopoly. Yes there were other MMORPGs, but none could even come close to WoW's success to threaten it or pull a significant portion of Blizzard's costumers. So in practicality it is a monopoly. The competition is insignificant, so Blizzard was free to set the rules for themselves.
---
Ohh kk ty, but there might be some sort of pannel from an addon right?
---
To bolster your point I had 5 accounts, prior to the Bnet integration. 
---
1 for me. 1 for my own RAF shit. 1 random one that I bought on sale to help someone get RAF credits. 1 for RAF shit with a woman I was dating (who I know for a strong fact will *never* play again.) Then finally an account I picked up for a friend who then abandoned it. 
---
So that’s 5 accounts for one guy. Yeah there were two kinda unenthusiastic people besides me that temporarily played them. But still. 
---
If every person is magically like me, then that 100 million accounts is more like 60 million players total, of which 40 million hate the game and would never consider playing it again. 
---
Which would leave about 20 million actual players, that acutually were invested enough to maybe come back. 
---
To me that feels more accurate than 100 million accounts equating to 100 million people that all actually played, became invested, and would come back. 
---
My guess would be yes, but my experience in classic itself is nigh nonexistent.
---
You have world/global for LFG/LFM spam. Only use I see is for the communication between factions. Which might be good or bad depending on the situation. Cross factions mafias will be a thing.
---
Yes there is a lot of competition. However, since tanks are usually sparse, you will easily find groups and might even have the luxury of reserving items for yourself if you form your own groups.
---
Why did it shut down 
---
Classic is going to be very small.
---
Worst Case Scenario: 
---
Blizzard completely fuck up Classic.    
---
We waste $15 for a month's subscription.    
---
We all move back to the private servers, which now have updated data and are even closer to Blizzlike.
---
Or, since you're creating the group, just don't invite any rogues or hunters.
---
In raids, depending on your guild it might be more or less fair. 
---
Over legal threats from Blizzard &amp; the team agreed to fully shut down after closed doors meetings with Blizzard executives (and allegedly helping to push for retail classic).
---
Without future content or QOL Classic will be dead at naxx just like every private server that has been made. Yes let’s wait almost two years for a game, wish for no future content and be done after 1.5years.
---
This is a chance to take the game to an entirely different direction. They can reboot their game, admit their fuckups and take us to an entirely different direction. I’m not saying updates or any changes will happen right away, of course there won’t be a need for that. But for a future with the game.. yes updates will have to happen. And BFA or current live wow is dead and will be replaced with classics future.
---
Ive debated with plenty of players on the forum.  Blizzard is doing exactly what Jagex has done. Like many gaming companies, they’ll follow the same method that is working.  They are here to make money and keep players subbed. 
---
man that hill in the barrens, right in between ratchet and xroads..
---
What patch was nost on?
---
I agree. Anyone playing retail, that pays attention, has seen the change. TBH the GCD changes came from a similar philosophy imo. 
---
Legion was really fast paced, and due to the number of proc abilities that were off the GCD rewarded twitch reflexes over careful planning. 
---
It really seems like they made that GCD change to move the game closer to its RPG roots. 
---
Overall gameplay has a slower pace, but as dungeons are now often more complex, one can utilize that slower pace to craft better strategic decisions. Said slower pace also makes it easier to then execute said strategic decisions, as they aren’t interrupted or disrupted by a proc of a higher priority ability. 
---
There’s a number of other little changes like that as well. But I agree with your sentiment. There’s clearly a drive, inside the dev team, to have retail reintegrate certain systems and philosophies from Classic. 
---
You can go to mulgore at level 1 and do all quests there like a Tauren 
---
The only race specific quests are Hunter pet ones, if you roll Orc/Troll you will need to return to durotar at level 10 to get your let 
---
Suppose I may as well... I played right before and right after Cataclysm. Looking for a community to play with and friends to make. I'm of the working adult group but I have no other real commitments other than work at the current time. 
---
* Intended region: **NA**
---
* Intended server type: **Any** (Not a lot of PvP experience though)
---

---
* Intended raid/play times: **EST after 7pm probably**
---

---
* A preferred form of contact: **PM**
---
My previous experience in the game was being a glass cannon mage who eventually picked up on don't pull the boss to yourself and that red burny stuff - yeah, it burns. Since I don't have the experience that most players have in Vanilla I lean towards wanting to do the content without all the guides and videos but at the same time, I don't think I, or many of us, will have the time allotment to dump into the game for that sort of thing. Planning on playing a mage, race undecided since I can't play blood elf. Other wise, if the guild needs a class for something, I'd be up to playing through a different class - just don't ask me to heal, you won't survive. :)   
---
With all that said, I'm torn between wanting to be one of the 'hardcore' types or more casual. I guess it will depend on the guild   
---
It was far from bug free with some adjustments that where not blizz-like. The adjustments where mostly to handle the big population. It was just the first private server that became insanely popular with 10k+ online at all times the months leading up to its shut down. 
---
I guess you could say it was the first server that wasn’t corrupt, aka making money behind the scenes. I just think it didn’t live long enough for those issues to become public.
---
&gt; Edit: oh wait sharding lol
---
There's still going to be an ass load of people.
---
There will be a lot of competition for gear, especially for a dps warrior. First of all, there will be a lot of warriors used for the raid, expect 4-8, possibly even more in some scenarios. Secondly, you will have to roll on the same gear as rogues (I wouldnt count hunters, competent guild leadership wont give an item like Drakefang Talisman to a hunter), and you already have a lot of rogues in the raid on top of the warriors. Another thing is that the tier gear that rogues cant roll for is specifically itemized for tanks, so unless you want to tank a lot, those items will go to other warriors. 
---
In general (not just raids but also dungeons), your main competition will be rogues. And due to how popular those classes are, I wouldnt be afraid to say warriors are the class with the biggest gear competition in the game. However, you see this everywhere and mages+warlocks and healers as a whole are not that much easier to gear. You will have 40 people in the raid and only handful of items dropping (and half of them will not even be good), so the gear competition is usually all over the place. I'm pretty sure druid healers are the easiest to gear.
---
I used vent and teamspeak back in the day and have been using discord on the progression servers in EQ. I imagine it will be the same with WoW being that it is used for guild functions and just do tells in pugs.
---
Why do you assume that everyone who stopped playing (besides bots/multi accounts ect.) will return?
---
gearing from dungeons will be kinda easy but not in raids
---
they will give the good stuff first to the raiders, not to you for the pvp set.
---
First one was battle tanks on Atari 2600, first online was UO then EQ. 
---
While horde racials are very strong for pvp I wouldn't get so hung about them. Play something you enjoy and work through the strengths and weaknesses. Both sides have them and most classes have clear counter classes. 
---
Classic isn't an expansion, they were talking about retail WoW.
---
good argument  
---
chickun
---
Then you consigned yourself to having shit gear, unless you did the R14 grind.
---
You'll get downvoted because in almost every country most people regularly spend £15 for a single takeaway or a single evening out with a couple of drinks. Even if you only play 1 hour a day (and by your own admission some days you play 5-10h) you're getting 30 hours of entertainment for $15.  
---
$0.50 an hour for entertainment is a pretty good deal and let's be honest, that's on the low side of value.
---
I imagine it will eclipse the retail player base. We didn't call it "World of WarCrack" back then for nothing. 
---
Lul, you probably worship Jeff Bezos. 😂😂😂
---
Well it is against ToS, so No reason to be upset.
---
15k people online at China primetime..laggy af but still miss it &lt;3 
---
Buyable cosmetics ruins the atmosphere and feel of the MMO because when you see players you should recognize what they've done and how powerful they are from what they're wearing. When you see something cool you should think "wow! how do i get that!" and the answer should never be "go out of game, go to the website and spend £10".  
---
WoW tokens are just straight up pay to win which is incredibly stupid.
---
&gt; Sharding is needed
---
Sharding might also provide a more realistic "vanilla experience"
---
Vanilla had 100,000 peak players on release. On 89 servers. So peak was just shy of 1,123 players per server.
---
187 players  spread out between the 3 starting zones through level 20 or so.
---
But that still means that 20-50 players in Northshire Abbey / Valley of Trials, etc as new players come in on a consistent basis.
---
So sharding limiting a subzone like Northshire Abbey / Valley of Trials to 20-50 **IS** the vanilla experience.
---
It is sort of a problem. A good example is UBRS, there are about 5 prebis pieces you need and you will be competing with other warriors/rogues/hunters (so probably around 4 other people you will have to roll against on average I would say). If you are tanking you probably can get away with reserving an item per run but people might not want to deal with that unless you are geared. The only way to get around this problem is to do lots of runs, I know some people that will have to do 30-40 UBRS runs to get all their prebis they need just because of shitty RNG.
---
You're going to be hanging out in lvl 1 zone the whole time?
---
Yeah I’m not sure what he’s talking about. 
---
On every server I raided on the removal of the attunements for SSC/TK just increased the number of guilds that would at least do Lurker and Reaver. 
---
Even the worst guilds would then move on to down a few more bosses once they’d farmed those two for easy look for a month or so. 
---
Plus anyone progression raiding was still going in there as it was a required step for the Hyjal/BT attunement, which as you mention, wasn’t removed until well later.
---
So. Yeah. I don’t know what that guy is rambling about. 
---
Of course she can do it, remember that a ton of people started WoW as 12 year olds that never tried anything like it before. Surely your gf can do it too then!
---
I actually got a somewhat relatably experience, I got my gf into GW2. Before she never played anything but The Sims. In the start she didn't want to fight, so she just explored and did non-combat tasks (you can level that way in GW2). Then as she got more comfortable with her character she tried to battle some animals and loved it. She doesn't play anymore, but she does have 4 max level geared characters on her account and loved to do some big dragon world bosses at the end. She never got to dungeons or raids, but they require a lot of mechanical skills in GW2 with fast reactions and a lot of movement compared to WoW.
---
There were one problem for her even later on; keybinds. I learned her not to click and she used her main attacks, but she often forgot her utility and never really got comfortable with keybinds outside of numbers and Q / E. If she got more used to remembering her utility she would probably have learned better reaction with keybinds, since she could do Q and E where she had some essential skills.
---
Something I'd *really* recommend to start her with is a pet class. Always having a pet really helped. She felt more comfortable with a companion, especially since it could tank and not stress her out form getting attacked. Secondly, being ranged was comfortable, no stress from a mob hitting since you were far away and could kite away. When she got pretty good at the game she went on to elementalist and loved it despite being squishy and not having a pet.
---
It wouldnt surprise me if they phase people in other areas too. Just gotta wait and see
---
&gt; WoW tokens are just straight up pay to win which is incredibly stupid.
---
You can't buy all your gear with gold. And gear doesn't matter too much, you can still be a shit player. 
---
Many will barely chat in public channels outside of sterile statements like "lfg", let alone shit talk.
---
You're liable to get right click reported and sanctioned by Activision Blizzard.
---
1.12.1 
---
"Hold on. Just because we were relying on forums and video downloads instead of youtube doesn't mean the exact same info wasnt out there."
---
i agree, a lot of information that is out there today has been out there back then. my point is after so many years the quantity depth and quality of content is much higher and way more accessible. back then not a lot of people went for that in any extreme form at least from my experience whereas today you get everything served on a silver platter. if you want information its realy easy to get in a often much more accessible way for the average player.
---
"Also take some things with a grain of salt. Its a private server."
---
this is true ofc. There are def. some boss mechanics and other stuff that worked a bit differently in the actual retail version like onyxias breath for example.
---
The face on the HotS version makes her look like a JoJo character
---
Streamer: I’m going to do this thing that breaches TOS

The post being replied to was claiming you'll have to buy Classic like a normal expansion. So far we've seen nothing to indicate that this will be the case, as far as we know you should just be able to activate a subscription on any WoW account, new or old, and log right in to a Classic server without any additional hoops. 
---
I’m sure there is, but other people would have to be using it otherwise it wouldn’t really give you the answer you’re looking for.
---
I might note two other things:
---
1: AV is the only BG where you can get a lot of use out of AoE damage which would probably be the best for running up the meters. Otherwise you’re really looking for high single target damage.
---
2: who cares how much damage you do? I’m not trying to be flippant and I guess you also care, but I would think in BG’s the main goal is winning, not running up damage meters?
---
Do hunters in Vanilla benefit from plain + attack power or it has to be specified that it is RAP?
---
Someone already answered your question. Tank and form your own group. Do not invite classes in which you compete with. 
---
Highmaul was the first raid of the expansion. 
---
Historically, those are much easier, even on Mythic, than later raids.
---
I didn’t raid Highmaul Mythic myself, but I do not recall the community acting like it was a hard instance. 
---
So it may make sense to take that in context.
---
If he got an anything first on Mythic Tomb, I’d be praising him. As a Tomb was a guild breaking, legendarily hard, mythic raid instance. 
---
But Highmaul? No. 
---
I like how everyone always shits on pservers but literally all nostalgia screenshots posted here are taken on pservers.
---
I doubt it. There will be a server pop cap so the only reason for phasing is for the starter areas so people don’t get frustrated and just log off trying to get to lvl 5.
---
Still wish there wasn’t any though.
---
Pretty sure they shut it down when Blizzard decided to develop Classic and then contacted the team about it.
---
Yeah i understand it in starting areas but Im not getting my hopes up blizzards current track record.
---
Hopefully it's the classic we all want
---
I would assume in May with an offchance they announce a delay in April
---
Horde can potentially have a wpvp advantage and Alliance is better in bgs &amp; raids. I wouldn't worry about choosing faction or race for a minor advantage, especially if you already know what you'd actually enjoy
---
If i were to choose a rogue, would that 25% stun resistance really be minor? There will be a lot of orcs i reckon.
---
It's even worse on horde; lots of old meta DPS items like DFT and Accuria are actually MT priority now because of threat generation. On the other hand on horde you don't have ret paladins to steal your gear in dungeons and horde DPS warriors in general prefer axes over swords because of the racial, so somewhat less competition from rogues in raids. Also, you can go 2H fury for raids on horde because of Windfury totem, so you get priority over good 2H drops that you can use for PvP as well.
---
I liked BGs Arena and WPvp. I’d it all and I did slot of it up until the end of Wrath 
---
Druids are less intuitive than some other classes to achieve their win conditions, but they’re very effective. I love having druids on my BG teams, for a variety of reasons. The combination of roots, buffs, mobility, heals, and damage. I legitimately lost against Tauren feral Druid in 1v1 in Warsong as an equally levelled Warrior earlier, as he could use roots and racial stun, heal up, get out of hamstring and keep fighting in his feral forms. Resto can be incredibly hard to kill for similar reasons, and are an asset to their team.
---
I'd love to hear your explanation for this.
---
Dwarf Rogue is probably the best rogue racial in PvP. Rogues simply have counters on both sides. Dwarfs can immune blind/slows bleeds and a dwarf hunter is a nightmare for a rogue. Humans deny openers and see you in stealth. You simply have to learn to deal with the counters and they are bad on both sides. 
---
Gnome Mage is very good in PVE and PVP which is something undead aren't (trolls quite a bit better in PVE). Blessing of freedom and cleanses on melee hard counter mages pretty hard. Mages DO beat Shamans but you have to learn how to fight them first and bad mages struggle with them.
---
Racials were never why Alliance were bad in real Vanilla WoW, especially on US servers. Ret Paladins played by little kids and morons who never used their utility and blessing of freedomed themselves instead of warriors was. The class was a magnet for the worst players in WoW. Will it happen again? I doubt it. Reckoning is the single most OP ability left in patched Vanilla. I don't think they can F up the spec this time with so much information out there. Add to this many  people will be rolling undead rogues due to old PVP videos. Rogues are pretty bad in BG's to begin with. The more you have, the more screwed the BG team is.  Ret Paladins also counter the heck out of rogues. Especially Dwarves.
---
Theres 2 no changs categories.
---
The first is WoW launch no changes, which was just normal spawn rates. This was alleviated by the fact that the servers would constantly crash and it was too laggy for most people that people were able to sufficiently seperate.
---
The second is for every subsequent new server that was launched had increased spawn rates for the first week or so. This is the vanilla experience that most people will remember if they liked rolling new servers and it worked fine. Given that these will just be like new servers opening up, i dont see why they wouldnt just maintain the same solution they had in 2005.
---
Ya and i have to agree with you. Blizzard has been known to say one thing and do another. 
---
I pray its the Classic we want as well. 
---
I doing the same thing i want to play human rogue in classic. The horde do have a advantage in racials for PVP but the alliance have a huge geological advantage in AV and also the alliance have a better leveling path so a lot of alliance players will be slightly ahead gear wise for BGs and remember there will be a lot of squishy undead mages so just avoid orcs in BGs lol.
---
Orc’s stun resist can be a real pain in the ass, I’ll tell ya. I would not call it a ‘minor’.
---
Since you're going Alliance, warlock isn't a bad choice for a spread pressure damage approach, as Horde only have a single class that can dispel your magic DoTs. Just be aware that UD rogues will be the bane of your existence.
---
Boomkin is not really a thing in Vanilla. It's probably, literally, the worst spec in the game. Folks only really go above 11 balance for 28/11/11 (hybrid pvp) or 24/0/27 (raid resto). It's bad because it's terribly mana inefficient and has poor survivability.
---
Shadow is arguably the best 1v1 spec in the game. It is what I main. Shadow runs dry in bgs quickly, for two reasons: (a) Viper Sting and (b) no natural mana regen mechanic. (a) can be offset somewhat by Jungle Remedy, Poison Resistance Potions, and the Poison Cleansing first aid thing. Friends can dispel it too. However, the trouble with all of that is that 80% or so of fights I get into in BGs I have a Viper String on me. It gets terribly expensive to remove it every single time. Plus, shadow's DoTs are easily removed and the best shadow priest race is undead because of the priest-specific racials they get, which is on the faction opposite that you're playing.
---
Mage AoE is the best in the game (imp Blizzard is tits), but rarely do players clump up enough to use it well. It's used more for chokepoint denial in AV in that sense.
---
Overall, I'd recommend warlock on this one. Prepare yourself to survive undead rogues.
---
And you are so naive to believe Blizzard won't crank down on those private servers?
---
Thats good enough for a movie. Amazing work, sexy af too.
---
There's not a great deal that Blizzard can do if they're hosted in the right counties.
---
This sub is full of people who hold on to the idea that private servers were full of bugs. In reality, noticable bugs were pretty much nonexistent. Maybe certain values weren’t 100% accurate, but that isn’t something anyone could notice.
---
On the other hand we have retail where I repeatedly tried dueling my level 6 Rogue friend as a Mage at level 6 and my frost spells had a 99% miss chance while fire blast did normal damage. Way to introduce players to the game!
---
&gt; On the other hand, after Classic is launched with all its features, they'll not have more development costs, and the subscription from Classic players will be enough to keep the game giving some money. 
---
Activision will certainly add services regardless. Those services generate an obscene amount of money for very little work. Believing anything else is naive
---
Classic isnt really classic. It brings back most of the mechanics but leaves a few out like BG jumping. I'll check it out regardless.
---
Would a human mage do well against most classes? Considering the racial
---
This whole thread is about how people sucked when they first player vanilla and you are talking about getting raid geared and grinding R14.
---
I think the joke and this thread flew over your head, mate.
---
it's not "always been like this", it's "it is working fine like this and it has been for 14 years".
---
and your idea maybe isn't new and isn't a viable business model.
---
can you point out  mmo that has a "pay by the hour" model?
---
how long it has been on the market, how many users etc?
---
i mean, you don't actually think that no one ever thought of this before, right?
---
I’d like to get a Zulian tiger, I was farming it 2x a week prior to Cata, but never got it to drop. So it’d be nice to get my hands on one in Classic. 
---
Going to raid through all of the content. Never got to do that as my main ding’d 60 about a week before TBC came out. So while I did see all of the content later at 70, I never did it at level. 
---
Going to have at least 2-3 level 60s. 
---
Going to go back and do “In Dreams” and that questline again. It really resonated the one time I was able to do it, and it would be great to revisit. 
---
Mostly I’m just going to go out and enjoy exploring my favorite iteration of Azeroth. I’ve missed it since Cata. 
---
Yeah the numbers are ridiculous, perhaps maybe 500k - 1M?
---
God I cant fucking wait for TBC Classic
---
Atleast we got a somewhat decent campaign based off of it in Starcraft 2.
---
You just gave reason after reason for why it is P2W but you find it acceptable, it should never be acceptable.
---
If you go Dwarf Rogue you can also take away blind. Which makes it a  bit more fair vs the orcs and you are still stronger vs the trolls/undead then.
---
Also if u don't wanna do that Human is atleast the strongest in PVE
---
&gt; so the only reason for phasing is for the starter areas so people don’t get frustrated and just log off trying to get to lvl 5.
---
If only. Many people (including me) are afraid of Blizzard goijg back on their word like they’ve done so many times. 
---
There’s one big reason to implement sharding outside of starting zones in Classic for acti-Blizz, and it’s saving money on server upkeep.
---
Nostalrius was amazing. I hope The upcoming classic will be how it was.. which I realize is weird to say. Since blizzards original wow was how nost was trying to be. 
---
I find it acceptable because people were buying gold anyway and now I don't have to deal with gold selling spam and shit like that. 
---
If you could buy more than a few pieces of good gear then I would have a problem with it as well, but right now it's basically the same as killing a couple of bosses on mythic, which pretty much anyone can do. 
---
that 2019 pic "I was there", the TipsOut classic demo duel tourney
---
People cheating shouldn't be rewarded by implementing official cheats.
---
It sucks. I’m not going to lie to you, but it won’t be a big enough deal to make you reroll.
---
It should be noted vanilla WoW itself was full of bugs and we loved it all the same!
---
Edited my post (sorry, bad habit). They are not cheats any more if they are official. 
---
You can buy (with gold) gloves and wrist slot items, that's it. I really don't give a shit about that, me just raiding one week will likely get me more armor pieces than that. 
---
Moonglade. No other class has a true cross-faction town dedicated purely to them.
---
weird enough he didn't talk about rarity  
---
its boring when everything is purple  
---
Only few items should've ever been epic imo. Characters should never be fully epic geared.  
---
Attack power counts as both RAP and melee AP. Agi is 1melee AP and 2RAP for hunters but some melees get no melee AP from agi. There’s practically 0 ranged AP items in the game outside of 2-3 ranged weapons. 
---
It doesn't matter if you give a care or not, it doesn't change the fact that it's directly pay to win.
---
There's extreme competition for the few good caster items in MC. I'm not even gonna bother to raid on my mage until BWL is out.
---
Yep thats what I was stating above. Hopefully they stay true to their word. 
---
What blizzard has going against them is that when they release the retail servers for classic, they can be easily emulated to a private server, and they already know how strong the vanilla pserver community is. 
---
So if bliz wont give us what we want they will lose us to the pservers again. 
---
you are just overreacting lol
---
i remember i installed the game after not playing for a bit and thought my game glitched out when i teleported to the dungeon in looking for group
---
No, it's literally impossible to transform modern WoW into something as appealing as Classic, it's too far gone and core systems that can't be replaced exist like Achievements and the pay to win/gold inflation it's caused.  
---
One of the biggest reasons classic is appealing is the fresh start prospect. If they take anything from this it'll be in a new game.
---
I never said it wasn't some form of "pay to win" (depending on how you define that term). I'm saying the little bit of advantage you get is small enough that it doesn't matter. Being a top tier raider is not really made easier in any significant way by buying gold. And definitely not being a top tier PvPer. 
---
I seriously doubt anyone in this game has felt that they ever "lost" in some way because the other guy had bought his way to power or something. 
---
If you are willing to tank and more importantly if you are good at it, you will have the luxury of forming your own groups and reserving items or completely filtering out classes that could roll on the items you're after. 
---
Warriors refusing to tank, rogues and hunters will have a much harder time getting their pre-raid BiS.
---
Guilds in MC might take up to 4-5 but guilds usually run 2-3 at most in AQ40/Naxx, and it isn’t too uncommon to see guilds running 1 hunter in these raids either. 
---
I’d say hunters raid spots are pretty scarce at all times. Early on, everyone and their mother rolls a hunter and competes for a raid spot. Later on, established guilds already have their core hunters and aren’t recruiting. 
---
From my experience on pservers, hunters are right behind melees in terms of competition for raid spots. 
---
To make sure you get a spot, bring consumes, don’t be late to raid, be smart, know your rotation and don’t fuck up. 
---
For 5 man dungeons, you could always just chose to not take any hunters / rogues / dps warriors along and only inv clothies I guess \^\^
---
Ahh, the Horde will never know the pain of wanting to link up with a friend on another continent.   
---
Going from the NElf starting area to the humans or vice-versa was a rite of passage.
---
Alliance has holy paladins. 
---
Alliance premades do better on pservers than horde premades. One reason being, it's easier to play a Hpally than it is to play a shaman.
---
Spriests are #1 in 1vs1.
---
If you are UD you'll get to level 4 or so IIRC. 
---
I'm actually always alliance! My friend is a die hard horde fan.
---
Other way around
---
Oh then you're good, dude. Going from. The troll start to mulgore is a cakewalk, go forth and have fun! Think of my gf and I corpse crawling across the wetlands to elwynn lol. 
---
The totem cleansing quest item requires Tauren race to use, so that (rather long) Mulgore quest line will be off limits
---
You need 5% hit for PVP. I’d assume if you have 10% hit from talents and someone has a 50% chance to resist your fear, you’d end up with a 40% chance to get your fear resisted. 
---
It will be when Retail WoW is done promoting their new patch. They don’t want to distract people from their other products until there’s a gap of releases. Know what I mean?
---
There's actually a trick where you kill yourself in the water north of ironforge in the bay. It makes you spawn at ironforge when you die. You should look it up!
---
Take my upvote! I'll check into it thanks! 
---
Back in BC, after several months of playing together, my lock arena partner revealed to me that he was a clicker and keyboard turner. We hit 2k though so idfk. I feel like that dude would have been the best lock on the server if he had used keybinds.
---
Id love to look like shit...thats what made some of the game fun.
---
Why not June 1st, the first day of winter?
---
Do you guys not have consoles?
---
The fact that you consider your information as contributing to an “educated guess” is hilarious. The people who upvote this kind of idiocy is the exact reason this subreddit is a massive circlejerk for retail haters. Until you can provide concrete numbers, then your “educated guess” means absolutely nothing at best. 
---
You know there was a whole other generation of '"normal players" right? Not everyone was a pimply faced teen. 
---
&gt; People want classic WoW as it was in difficulty and it will remaint hat.
---
Glad to see this - so many people forget that vanilla was hat.
---
Soon™
---
Don’t see how people try to make Horde racials as a clear favorite for PvP...? Stoneform, Expansive Mind/Escape Artist, Dwarf Priest racials, and Paladins in general are definitely as good as anything offered from Horde side. I’d say for anything group related Alliance has an advantage even in regards to racials. Coming from someone who doesn’t care to play Alliance at all if I have the choice.
---
If you want PvP gear you want plate and two handers anyway, so not much competition with others there. It's only really in PvE dps that you will be competing with rogues and hunters, and I think mostly in dungeons and maybe early raids. I know itemisation for fury got better in AQ and Naxx at least. 
---
There is a possibilty that they release classic just to get an underatanding of how much we really want the old game principles back because wow rn feela like a shitty single player game that you occasionally have to group with some nameless AIs
---
I thought paladins werent that good of a class in vanilla? Basically if i choose ally i should go gnome or dwarf then?
---
I think youre overplaying discord i imagine people will still use ingame chat a lot more
---
I know. I was not a "normal player", was way shittier than most. But all the "normal players" from back in the day that I've heard from on this says what I'm saying. That's what I'm basing this shit on, not just making it up in my head. 
---
Dungeons:
---
Yes you have a lot of competition with hunters and especially rogues. Yes they need baron cloak, yes rogues need cadavous, yes they need dal'rends(HUNTERS TOO!), yes they need truestrike, yes they need HoJ(some would say hunters too if we start without dm).
---
So you are gonna have a pretty hard time farming prebis. One thing that's very important though, is that you can TANK. Being able to tank not only makes it really easy to find groups meaning you can spam dungeons to get loot faster, but it also allows you to control the loot. A lot of people dislike reserving loot, but I see it as a free market, you have control by being able to tank, that puts you at an advantage that I see no reason for you not to exploit. Reserve loot smartly though. You need to set the limit so people actually want to join your runs. Do stratUD with first boss of living so rogue/hunter can get mask of unforgiven and join for that(and them knowing you won't need on it). Reserve truestrike but allow dal'rend to be rolled etc.
---
Another thing: You have a lot of purchased prebis. You get helm, legs/gloves(devilsaur/edge) and boots purchased. Wrists are easy, neck and 1 trinket is quest, mara ring can be bought with boost, belt from quest bow from DME can be 2-3manned, so really you don't need thatmany pieces, but the ones you need can be pretty hard. 
---
Raids:
---
fury warriors really don't have that many upgrades:
---
MC: Magmadar bow, Qstrike ring, onslaught girdle, brutality?, and maybe a 2hander. That's it. 
---
BWL: DFT, chrommatic boots, CTS, nef ring, trash cloak and maybe a 2hander. 
---
There's a good amount of competition though, rogues will want 1handers, DFT and such, but because you have so many items from prebis, you will honestly do a fuckton of damage even without these upgrades.
---
I am in favor of subscriptions for MMO's, but cosmetic micro transactions don't bother me that much.
---
If all it effects is the status symbol game then I could care less, if it does bleed into the game development and take focus away from that then the problems are larger, but typically those teams are total separate and the development of one doesn't effect the other.
---
There is something to be said for paying a subscription and knowing what you are getting for that fee.  I like knowing how frequent updates will be, what will be added and what to expect down the line and subscriptions allow that to be possible.  The bar is high for subscription games though, so it makes sense some companies opt for micro-transactions as a way to attract more people initially.
---
Definitely the latter, I played rdruid myself with a hunter, we got to rank 6 in 2s on our battlegroup, that whole time I was keyboard turning and clicking everything... imagine if I hadn't, then again everyone was
---
**hardest** of **all time**
---
Holy Paladins are ridiculously good in group based PvP.
---
And I’m not trying to insinuate that a particular race is must have for any class, play what you like (60 is a long journey and if you’re going that far I’m assuming you’ll put a lot of time in after that too).
---
You use the world objectively a lot more than I think you actually mean to. Either that or you don't quite understand what objectivity (or impartiality) is. Something to think about, would make your arguments a little stronger.
---
Holy Paladins were amazing. Best PvP healer easily, and a top PvE healer. Just no taunt so tanking is dicey, and ret DPS is like chucking a handful of dice weighted against you.
---
You heard wrong. There were many before, even for newer expansions (mostly TBC and WotLK, Cata and beyond is much harder to make but there are good Cata servers by now and MoP is being developed by them too).
---
Nost just got really popular, became flooded with people who had absolutely no previous knowledge of private servers and started claiming how "Nost was the ultimate private server, the first one that was good".
---
I guarantee today, on the 1/20/2019 a brand new player subscribed to World of Warcraft for the first time.
---
This means, obviously, that the player numbers *objectively* increased by 1. 
---
Therefore, the statement that "100 million is incorrect" is correct, because it far surpasses 100 million accounts. 
---
Let me rephrase. "best vanilla private server".
---
Also, I find myself wondering how many trial accounts it took to write susanexpress across the org back &amp; AH in level 1 orc warlocks for like 3 years. The number of trials was probably waaaaaay bigger than we think.
---
For PvP gear warriors doesn't have all that much competition, aside from other warriors. You will probably have a ton of competition for trinkets, rings, necks, shooters though, but I don't think it's much worse than for clothies. 
---
For dungeons you will also be able to form your own groups with as little competition as possible as a tank. 
---
In raids I really don't know, mostly depends on the competition in your guild. Hard to say overall. 
---
While this is true, GW2 doesn't \*deprive\* players of good looking skins or cosmetics through in game methods.  
---
The base game offered players a HUGE selection of skins earned through drops, achievements, vendors, etc.  
---
The pacing of new skins slowed down with the expansions though, but they do still add new skins with each season of content.  
---
I personally think it's a very healthy balance. Sure, they push out new weapon skins on the gem store often, but I personally only find myself buying them maybe a few times a year because of my personal tastes. Even so, the skins you can obtain through the black lion chest tickets can be sold on the Trading Post, meaning that players can buy these skins for gold.  
---
I think the only cosmetics that you MUST buy with gems are mount skins. The majority of weapon and armor skins can be bought through in game methods, and these methods don't feel like you're being pushed towards breaking out the credit card to get them 'faster'
---
Afaik mages are really good but struggle against locks/priests. No idea how they do against shamans but they do pretty decent against everyone else. 
---
Perception is a pretty bad racial because you need to know when there’s a rogue around to use it. I wouldn’t say it’s too good on mages either because you can unstealth them with blizzard/arcane explosions. 
---
Gnome has better racials for PVP (escape artist and more int) but you need to remember that racials matter a lot less than skill. 
---
Yeah people need to realize that 10k pop was never blizzlike and classic servers would lock and require login queues at certain thresholds. 
---
What tilts me about upcomming classic will be the spectre of phasing. If theres phasing in classic rerelease all my optimism and desire to partake is gone 
---
Does pay by the minute count? In that case WoW china, and im guessing 14 years?
---
Everything is sort of single target oriented in vanilla battlegrounds (aside from AV). If you want to deal a ton of damage, play warrior with a healer backing you up. 
---
Yeah ofc winning is the main goal but by pressuring multiple targets i feel like i can contribute a lot to winning. In retail at least it seemed really strong to have shadows afflis and balance druid in ur team and overwhelm them with multi target dmg. Imo the dmg meter can be tied strongly with winning
---
I'm sure that they have plotted classic to release sometime in a patch lull for bfa. This decision was probably made way back before retails player base tanked.
---
Yes Blizzard shut it down claiming copyright, Nost started lobbying blizzard to re-release classic. I think they have one of the nost members on their current developer team too?
---
If you mean they homogenized classes to balance arena, i heavily disagree, it was more to balance PvE I think, "bring the player not the class" as they said.
---
Ah, what a shame:/
---
zygor addon will be available for sure at classic release or soon after aswell.
---
I thought I could dps as a Paladin.
---
Nobody from the Nostalrius team is working for blizzard 
---
Vanilla itemization is less class based as it is armor type based. As a mage you’ll be competing with everyone that wears cloth, except for +arcane/frost/fire gear, which is rare
---
Classic is a cash grab at nostalgia. I'm hyped to the moon, but no one I know could care less. They will get cash from me and I'm ok with it. I come to this reddit for the hype and nostalgia. This game is not going to fix a corporate governance problem that stems from obligations to shareholders. It's cool to dream and hope, but we all need to come to terms that we are the target market, and our hype doesn't reflect the mass market. I'm looking forward to building relationships with you all in the game, and hope some of them result in real life relationships. See you there!
---
I do not miss 2-3 hour queue times. I was so glad when Blizzard opened free realm transfers off those servers
---
Yeah I think WoW will be easier than let's say a FPS game since that puts a lot more pressure on having good eye to hand coordination and understanding the movement in a FPS can be challenging at first (my gf have real trouble playing Halo). 
---
The only difficult part for her as far as I can see would be the mechanics and where to go and how items work etc but she has you to help her right so should be no problem at all.
---
&gt; Blizzard needs to man the fuck up and say loot trading isn’t a thing and we’re not giving you loot from making a whiny ticket 
---
FTFY 
---
I found Menethil Harbor the best place to set you HS as alliance
---
Eh, I still have almost all my screenshots from vanilla, but like most things done as a teenager they're painfully cringe inducing to look at. The captioned ones are the worst "Why fear death, when even death fears me" as I'm standing on top of a bunch of lowbies I ganked.
---
Let's all take a moment and appreciate the fact that someone took the time to strategize, plan, and implement something as trival as where and how to place class trainers... 
---
There was once a time where people cared about what they were creating and did not care about how it was going to make money.
---
Hopefully this one drops more than her hat.
---
That was kinda my thought as well. Maybe the 7.3.5 freeze was for the development, once it gets closer to launch they would update it to 8.1 (or 8.2, or w/e) and then keep it up to date with the retail client from that point forward. Otherwise they would have to maintain two entirely separate clients from that point forward, which is a huge waste of dev time.
---
&gt;Certainly arcane crystals are more reliable - you will get a few every hour but they are \~10% of the price of a lotus, which you will get every few hours.
---
Arcane crystals are not 10% the price of lotus. Depending on the server I'd say they would be about half as expensive.
---
Phasing on release for the early zones makes for better end game servers. Either you're going to have multiple dead servers and a massive clustefuck of broken and unplayable servers and I mean literally because of queues, or phasing with none of that with a bit of an annoyance to start with. Choice is pretty clear for me. 
---
Do both. Herb and mining supply is limited by the server with established respawn rates. Demand will be at all time highs at launch.
---
Even when AQ and Naxx are out lionsheart is BIS and there will be a good demand for crystals.
---
Honestly no. Ghost was scrapped because it wasn't meeting quality expectations. What's too bad is that they stopped that practice and started churning out crap.
---
Cant wait to be back
---
comrad, they were forced to do so by the particularities of that zone not because they wanted to.
---
also it was [cancelled](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4vh409/chinese_server_just_announced_the_change_of/).
---
Or people will notice queues on certain realms and simply start on a non-queue one. Just like they did on release. 
---
Super Mario Bros. 3 was my first vidya. In like 1994. It's been a while.
---
Yes, however with population dying out after a few weeks at best when the hype has died out for those who've never played it or haven't in a long time and they realise how grindy/unbalanced/not for them it is, most servers will end up dead. You either pick a full realm or a dead realm with no guilds no auction house etc. And with no server transfers, no boosts, no heirlooms and mounts being 40+, people won't want to reroll.
---
So like I said,  phasing at the very start for early zones is a non issue compared to what it will be without it. 
---
I haven't played it in 10 years. I did start in Vanilla, few months before BC, I never got to lvl 60, but I did play it. I will give as much advice as I darn well please, lump. 
---
The quest chain "A Humble Task" through to "Rites of the Earthmother" is Tauren only as far as I recall. 
---
Jesus Christ this cracked me up so hard, now I really want you to share your most cringe inducing ones. 
---
Thank you for sharing that, that’s amazing.  Please post
---
1) something being objective is not related to it being true or correct, but rather it being represented as fact without personal bias. You've used it correctly maybe 10% of the time in this thread. That was all I was saying, but since you brought it up.. 
---
2) the number probably (definitely) does surpass 100 million, but number of accounts created is not the same as number of players. We have absolutely no data to differentiate between the number of active unique players vs bot accounts &amp; trials over time, so everything you're saying here is speculative at best.
---
Lol.  Keep drinking that koolaid.  
---
I haven't heard of Immersion before, I just looked it up and I think it looks awesome! I sent a message to the creator if he is planning on porting it over to Classic. I'll let you know what he responds with.
---
Druid mana bar would definitely be useful. I will look into that.
---
Youre making so many assumptions out of thin air this conversation isnt even worth having. 
---
Fact is this game was released without phasing and did just fine. Thats the end of the conversation. 
---
Correct, I merely referred to crystals trending down over the period and lotus trending up. Both are valuable all through vanilla, only the ratio of values changes slightly
---
That wasn't my experience, if arcane crystals are half a lotus def get mining.
---
He did not.
---
Another one (dj khaled)
---
You saying "end of conversation" with zero rebuttal doesn't end the conversation, you know that right? You just look silly. 
---
The game released with far less launch players and was going to grow. It didn't need things like phasing when more servers could be opened. 
---
This release is going to be a lot bigger, and will have a sharp drop off too once people have had their nostalgia fill or whatever they will quit. It won't grow in the same sense as it will have originally, those who want to play it will be from the start.
---
Sub models actively hurt mmos imo. It's a barrier to entry. Look at bfa right now...if consider jumping in and checking the game out at each content update if i didn't have to pay a sub fee for it. 
---
A monthly sub makes it feel like if you don't play for the month you're wasting your money. So I'd rather just spend that cash on a different game that i can play whenever i want rather than just for 1 month. 
---
It's what kept me away from wow for 5 years when i quit at the start of cataclysm...it's what will likely keep me from every going back after the train wreck that is bfa.
---
that is precisely what I mean.
---
it attracts a certain kind of "humor" and mentality
---
I hope you are wrong, sincerely. It is just the gameplay that I want, not the graphics from back then. Vanilla had 5 pixels which everybody had to share. 
---
"Dylaaaan, get off, mom said it's my turn on the left pixel" 
---
Kill Kel'thuzad. Cliché, I know, but I've replayed classic on privates and stuff always comes up or the server gets shut down before I make it. This time, this time it's gonna happen.
---
Lost it at ‘become disabled’😂
---
&gt; I would just go with bad design personally (debuff limit, balance issues, class design, mana etc.)
---
Debuff limit were due to technology, not a design decision. Even retail has a debuff limit but it's just so high you never get near it.
---
As for the other, I agree. Having spells with no CD being the best damage per mana while also giving mana limitation means that you spam that one spell. As an example mages Fire Blast has a CD, so it should have better DPM to make it worth using on CD, then fill with Frostbolt / Fireball. DoT classes like warlocks are more difficult due to the debuff limit.
---
As for the rest of your (many) points, you are right.
---
I mean Blizzard contacted the Nostalrius team about it, like Blizzard shut Nostalrius down.
---
This is the easiest way to do it, only clothies
---
I will use discord only for guild business, raids , pvp and guild meetings.  (and personal friends) 
---
I won't use it for pugs and if people expect me to, I'll find other players to group with. 
---
It's clear to me that you dont know what you're talking about, because they're not going to run bare metal infrastructure any more. That's not how it works. They will have scalable architecture that allows them to hot add resources as needed.
---
You're thinking 2004 infrastructure but it's nearly 2020. That's not how it works any more. Source: am literally systems engineer, this is literally my job (but not at blizz) 
---
Guessing 12 years then? 
---
and that is the reasonable and good approach to that problem. sharding isnt.
---
the biggest reason is that you felt attached to your character and your gear.    
---
the community build arround that and the largest driving force from it was peer pressure.  
---
the game felt more real as none of the goals in it were artificial.  
---
it is this sort of attachment that makes you login every day with the hopes to get a little bit further with your characters.  
---
sure, sometimes you would take breaks and goof arround, but in the end you always strived to improve your toon. 
---
And it kills every effort to make guild forums work.  back in the day guilds all had forums with member only parets, for me that was a big part of the community building.  guides, tips, banter, personal backstories of guildies etc etc.  For me that was better quality than the average discord channels 
---
Paladins are usually more trouble to kill than they are worth. Not to mention you have bubble hearth to avoid high level gankers. Sure it’s not ideal, but it lets you skip several minutes of being camped with ease.
---
He’s not making assumptions, Blizz said they were going to have some phasing in starting zones for the first few weeks. I do not want phasing either but, if it’s just for the beginning I’m okay with that. It’s probably the best choice too like that other guys said. 
---
No, it was the constant real battle between the horde and alliance on the forums...real feuds, real fun, real conflict... 
---
Attached to character and gear were secondary for me...
---
The game felt like a living breathing thing...now it’s just stale af...
---
still missing the fact that we talking about communist china?
---
guess all you need to do is go back in time and live there
---
Dun Morogh is a lvl 1 zone
---
drama  in the months before, during and after the Opening of the AQ gates was the best gaming experience of my life.   We were just a  medium sized EU server, not world first stuff, but it had Everything (good and bad) 
---
Trump, is that you?
---
It was alive...the game now might as well be single player...
---
you cant feel any nostalgia if you enter servers that have sharding, because vanilla didnt have sharding. the reason people are even asking for classic is because they hate the idea of shardinf in mmos in general. your argument is retarded.
---
I'm pretty sure it's in classic at some point if not  always. i did most of my "warlocking" in vanilla and distinctly recall the VWs "I don't like this place" and "send me back".
---
Logic is strong here 
---
Black Desert is popular? Almost never hear the name 
---
Is there any point to throwing weapons? I feel like warriors or rogues will just equip a bow or gun to pull since sometimes those have stats on em. Are there any special or cool throwing weapons that have stats or special effects?
---
This is exactly what I used to do as a warrior. Also hated it when I played as a hunter and no one would invite me lol
---
It is totally possible if you are willing to show her without getting frustrated. 
---
relevance of that is...?
---
i dont know man, im coming from dota and there, if bugs exist for some time they just transition into features.
---
They're always quick to brigrade the subreddit when ever it hits too close to home.
---
Thank you for your replies. European English realms will work just perfect for me!
---
Everyone who didn't suck is being downvoted. I guess classic is going to be filled with scrubs. Keyboard turners and clickers, just like the old days.
---
Sorry,I was already an adult and was pretty good. actually I wasn't that good, but since I happened to be the 3rd lvl 60 warlock of the server (warlock was very unpopular at launch, many gave up before reaching lvl 40)   I got 'conscripted' into what would become a leading guild.  I had no clue what raiding was, but it sounded fun, so I said yes.  anyway I could not say no, they were very clear on that.   I was an orc and I they NEEDED me , I had to fight for Thrall, my duty etc etc.   Next thursday, 19:00 MC be there!     So I got whipped into shape  (although it would take some time to get onyxia attunement)  and a few months later I was a seasoned raider, and was loving it.   I played pretty hardcore for almost 2 years, something I had never done before in any game, but then just before TBC I needed more time for work, so I quit the regular raiding and just played a bit more casual.
---
 
---
This is quite easily googled
---
The game is rather popular...but holds all the core values of wow minus the pay to have convenience...
---
Experiencing Nost in its prime is what will make me choose the most populated server come Classic.
---
Nothing beats logging into 10k+ online and the absolute shitshow it is.
---
Having to avoid trolls in STV or learning to level while dodging 60s, constant faction wpvp, competition for farming, discovering lesser known quest levelling routes, utterly packed auction house.....
---
 I never thought I would enjoy it so much and I worry a regular 2k population server will seem dead to me now
---
I have been a raid warlock for many a year and never had trouble getting consumables.  
---
Ghost mushrooms for greater shadow power potions were the biggest bottleneck, they only grow in a a very limited amount of spots in the world. 
---
I never did much solo farming,  just group dungeon runs, for Righteous Orbs,  Large brilliant shards etc , and I was tailor / herbalist, so I could gather my own herbs.   Sometimes I would farm some felcloth (sell mooncloth)  and stuff like essence of water, that was always enough to use 1-2 flasks a week and all the lesser consumables needed.   (we usually only used flasks on 1 highest tier raid night, and not on the easy raid stuff)
---
I couldn't find exactly how much gold per hour you get form DM farming as a lock.
---
The problem is back then most people had never played an MMO and the internet were different. Now everyone knows about BiS and "meme specs". The biggest problem is most people don't know much about it themselves aside from what they read on forums like here. This means most people think it's mandatory.
---
I'm afraid BiS and right spec might become a real thing in Classic.
---
I hope they realize that.
---
Blizz has been super out of touch recently. I can see them fucking up Classic and the community splitting between to pservers and actual classic
---
Googled vanilla warlock farming and there is a video right there saying 50-100g/h
---
You can farm  lashers about as good as anyone else, and even after you hit the instance cap you can solo pretty well with enslaved demons/banish. The nice thing is no specific spec is required to do either.
---
adblock takes care of that (haven't seen any youtube ad in years on PC), but I agree that the content usually is very low quality, and even if it's decent, a simple text window would present the same information much better and faster. 
---
That is amazing. Im going to need to see more.
---
nice thank you.  I watched all the videos a year ago but It didn't carry over to the private server nighthaven which nerfed the gold farming methods.  I hope this isn't the same in classic wow.
---
I wish this sub had more content actually talking about classic wow instead of just "DAE THINK RETAIL SUX?!". I play retail now and it's not horrible, it's just different. I enjoyed vanilla, tbc and WotLK more but whatever, I'm entertained. This whole sub just seems to want to circle jerk and I'd bet half the people dont have a clue what they are in for when classic launches.
---
We have no way of knowing until beta. Just relax. Any class can farm gold.
---
Where’s the community interaction in that?
---
I disagree.  the information back then was BETTER than it's now.  Not right at the start, but after a year or so when the best strategy websites got up to steam (elitist jerks etc) the info was top notch.  Endless pages of serious theorycrafting and discussions on mechanics and minor details.    Less video material, for sure, but in written form the info was GREAT.  A video is not needed to explain a concept or a fight in great detail, but it seems the young generation has lost the ability to process information in older forms. 
---
In comparison most of the content released in vanilla is sub par lol. The gates of Qiraj was a pretty shit event. Too fucking laggy to do anything and the two raids that came out of it were pretty damn bland. The whole thing was a giant time gated event with some of the most ridiculous rep grinding I've ever experienced. The only saving grace was that it felt alive at the time because every level 60 was running around Silithus doing shit.
---
You will wear a blue cloth dress and you will like it damnit
---
Alright thanks. Maybe that server is just missing them.
---
If they nerf dm east similar to nost you can easily solo Mara for great gold warlock is just behind hunter for best Mara solo
---
The succubus speaks too, no?
---
I don't like sharding either but it sure as hell beats getting to 60 and realising your server has no one left. 
---
Pay to win*
---
My worry is that after the initial surge (whether it be 3 weeks or 6 months) most servers will end up as ghost towns
---
its nor like sharding would be the only solution to that problem.
---
What else would you suggest to ensure minimal servers, and thus higher populations later on once it has calmed down? Transfers and server merges are off limits for obvious reasons.
---
Rather take the 3 hour of sharding in the starting zone instead of 3 week server downtime cus people crashed the server.
---
Exactly. I dont have any burden to prove why we dont need sharding. Its classic wow. If its not from classic then you need a damned good reason to change it. Server transfers/migrations will still be an option.
---
Sharding is ultimately for blizzard's benefit. Its a software solution to a hardware problem. Blizzard phased out the old style server blades that could support more players at once because they could instead using multiple smaller ones to accomplish the "same" thing through sharding. But its not the same. 
---
If its to blizzards benefit, what would stop them from utilizing the same tech for their own benefit at other bottleneck issues. Capital city raids are problematic, cause lag, and server instability. Shard em. Congregating around the AH/banks, also causes the same problem. God forbid they devastate the whole AQ opening with sharding because of its server strain.
---
I want wow classic. Not wow semi classic, not wow sorta classic, not wow blizz shortcut classic. Its not in my interest as a consumer to want sharding, so for me its a total nonstarter for consideration. 
---
Mining: not only for arcane crystals (20-35g per, on average), but once the server has established itself a bit you'll be able to make a lot on iron and heavy stone due to people that use engineering but dont have mining. Iron grenades. And iron veins are aplenty and easy to farm in high volume. But definitely wont be profitable at launch, the economy needs time to establish itself. 
---
Nah it’s not pay to win... can’t buy gear... don’t have to pay anything but little quality of life and there is no sub model 
---
Kill the mobs in the camp just south of the entrance to Timbermaw Hold. Each kill gets you rep, you have to kill to Unfriendly for the mobs to not attack you.
---
Don't kill the mobs in the tunnel and don't kill the ones in Azshara, they're part of the Timbermaw faction and will reduce your rep.
---
Killing furbolgs of opposing clans (winterspring and I believe felwood) will increase rep from the timbermaw. 
---
&gt;Debuff limit were due to technology, not a design decision  
---
Resource issue then (as they were clearly able to rise it later, just didn't have time for it).  
---
I just hope they decide to continue making updates down the line like OSRS and bring the gameplay from newer expansions  to it, for pve. Or alternatively they could improve retail :)  
---
idk about retail, but it isnt in vanilla.
---
I can't help but wonder why you would want to do this? The absolutely most important ability for a dps warrior is Mortal Strike / Bloodthirst. Look at the wording of each. MS is calculated on weapon damage, so it does several times more damage with a 2H. BT is based on attack power so it doesn't matter that you DW.
---
Honestly? If you want to DW in PvP you should go Fury. You can still get 17 points into Arms, meaning a Fury spec will only lack Sweeping Strikes (not useful in PvP most of the time), Improved Hamstring and The debuff of Mortal Strike.
---
On Fury you get additional Death Wosh (dmg, but also imune to fear), lower CD on intercept, Flurry (nice for dmg) and BT that as I've said does far more damage than MS if you DW.
---
All of this assumes that when you spec either you also get some points onto the other, something like 31/20/0 or 17/34/0 specs.
---
To make it more simple, what use is MS debuff if you can't deal any damage anyway? BT / MS is your absolute prime damage outcome, DW MS means you don't have any real damage.
---
Community is one of the reasons wow was good but certainly not the only one.  For me the game (mechanics) and the world design were more important.
---
I would rather look at your funny screenshots than the 3253th thread of MUH circlejerk
---
They've been slowly removing RPG elements for years in order to better streamline the experience and now we've gotten to a point where everything has become so arbitrary and convoluted, the game just feels hollow. 
---
If they have any humor, they'll announce a release date on April 1st, so that none of us really know if they're being sincere or not.
---
It’s actually a good way to level if you wanna get the modo mount too. Always liked getting the modo quickly as a troll or orc. 
---
Hi, /u/meekerdeekers
---
Yep, that's what I'm planning to do.
---
&gt; oure making so many assumptions out of thin air this conversation isnt even worth having.
---
If you're talking about the inevitable population decline, it's not an assumption. Every vanilla private server since Nostalrius has seen the same development: explosive start fed by hype followed by a steady decline in the months that followed. Nostalrius' biggest rival, which at the height of Nost's popularity was often touted as the better scripted server despite a vastly smaller playerbase, was the destination of a lot of Nost "refugees" after they got shut down. They had an explosive population increase to peaks that rivaled Nostalrius, yet by the end of the year only 8 months later that peak was in the low hundreds divided over two servers. After that followed the Nostalrius reboot project, which had a peak population of over 30K players at launch, the biggest in private server history. By march that population had halved, by may it was only a third. In november 2017 the remaining  players of that server switched to server, the result of a coup from one of the admin server manager copying all character data and deleting the backups, essentially stealing all of its player while crippling the competition. This reboot of a reboot managed to get peaks of 10K at its launch, which had halved only a few months in. By spring 2018 their average peaks ranged around the 3K. This was when I stopped following the private server scene.
---
These are only the big projects, there were a bunch of smaller ones that went down similar roads. And these are already players that are actively looking for classic wow options. The official classic servers are going to attract a lot more mainstream attention.
---
*Repost because the original comment contained the names of the private servers, which are blacklisted by subreddit rules.
---
WC3R will come out near the end of the year, after blizzcon most likely. They still have a lot of work to do.  
---
Going by their release schedule for content and raid tears, there is 5 to 6 months between each raid.  
---
Battle for Dazar'alor releases in 2 days. Meaning we add 5 months to that at least. So we end up with June release for the next tear.  
---
They definitely won't release Classic in April or May and they don't want Classic and BFA to compete for sub $.  
---
So they are most likely to release Classic in September (right at the end of calendar summer), after the Naga raid has been played out for few months.   
---
Then they will have "drought" between Naga raid and next raid which is 2 to 3 months long, perfect for Classic to come in and bring the sub $.  
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought that first.
---
Imp says some funny stuff, like "Is this reeeally necessary?" when attacking for example.
---
Though Blizzard also hasn't increased sub cost since release.  $15 in 2004 with inflation is comparable to $20 today.  Really what it comes down to is that Blizzard thought it would be more beneficial to expand on the cash shop vs increasing player sub costs to keep up with inflation.
---
As far as I can remember only the Volkswagen Blueberry and the Succubus had spoken voice lines when summoned.
---
During BC they added a bunch more of them to every one excluding the doggy, such as the imp giving you lip instead of just cackling.
---
You only need to buy the xpac to play, and there is literally nothing on the shop that is in anyway necessary.
---
Really it is: xpac cost + sub.  Which has been the case for every other subscription MMO that actually got far enough to create expansions.
---
If I had to guess sometime between March and May.  That being said I still won't be surprised at all if this gets pushed back, it really seems like they still have a ton of work to do.  Please don't misunderstand, I want to play tomorrow, I'm just not sure it's going to happen this summer.
---
Is there a way to build a true hybrid out of shaman?
---
Assuming I have pre-raid gear:
---
1. If I go with 0/20/31, some crafted two-hander and melee gear, would I be able to kill mobs with decent speed?
---
2. Are there any melee oriented staves in end game content? What about all-stats gear (str, agi, stam, int on 1 item)?
---
3. Will it be useful to "weave-in" lightnings in between slow two-handed attacks?
---
4. If there's no way to build melee healer, then how good is caster 30/0/21 at farming?
---
No, they eventually added a combo point finisher skill for rogues (Burning Crusade I think) that required throwing weapons, otherwise they were pointless
---
same here, Moonglade was basically my home, and the Slaughtered lamb was AMAZING to discover. I found it completely random with my druid, didn't even know before that it existed. It was such a unique experience.
---
Damn.
---
I really loved Wotlk and maybe its because I was in a semi-hc guild. I didnt really have to ”explore” the bad parts with stupidly easy content, LFR and other bad stuff and for thats Im thankful.
---
I rememer the days we all got together, progressing for weeks, competing against the opposite faction for server firsts in argueable WoWs best designed raids. The feelings, I miss them. 
---
Feathers drop from them and you can gain rep fast by handing them in. If you plan to go for exalted you should save every feather and then some for when those mobs stop giving rep.
---
&gt;Any suggestions
---
Standard advice: tell people _where you're located_.
---
Nobody wants to join a server two time zones away and be stuck with lag.
---
"So in practicality it is a monopoly." No its not, its market dominance. And there are MMO's wich are more played than WoW in asia. For example Dungeon Fighter Online, or Lineage 1, so does DFO or Lineage 1 have the MMORPG monopoly? 
---
What is the point of having more than 1 stable spot as a hunter? I understand learning new abilities from taming higher level pets. 
---
Do people bring out pets with certain abilities while leveling for certain situations? Or could I just tame a cat and teach it new abilitie as I level up? Or just tame a new car and feed it? 
---
Wtf, i told the other guy he doesnt know what a monopoly is, why you post me the definition, i know exactly what a monopoly is and market dominance is not it.
---
I'm pretty sure the Voidwalker and Succubus have always had lines. The Imp got their later, probably during TBC. Before that they just made the regular imp noise.  
---
" A monopoly (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) μόνος mónos \["alone" or "single"\] and πωλεῖν pōleîn \["to sell"\]) exists when a specific person or [enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company) is the **ONLY** supplier of a particular commodity. "  
---
How does blizzard have a monopoly on MMORPG's again? 
---
What faction will most streamers play?
---
i'm not talking about people who may or may not play, i'm talking about the games quality itself, which would then eventually draw people in. Reread the post with that in mind and you can see where i'm coming from.
---
I have hopes for an addon that might be a bit difficult to make, but I'd love to see a guild group finder addon integrated with today's smartphones, so that I could receive real time updates when people hop online and are ready to run an instance.
---
For example, say I'm currently offline, doing other things, and my phone buzzes, it's my guild dungeon app: "2 dps lfm dead strat". I think "hmmm, maybe I should hop on and help my guildies, but damn, I really need to finish this report for work". I keep plugging along with my work, but I get another buzz a few minutes later, "Just need 3rd dps have tank n heals let's go". "Whelp, screw the report, time to fight some undead with muh guildies!"
---
I think as the original player base has aged and seen a loss of free time due to work, family, etc., being able to use their limited time efficiently would be of great interest to many. 
---
Toss in some check boxes for instances/group quests/world pvp you'd like to do, and keep it all within your guild, and you'd have a great way to help maximize your playtime.
---
The only guide I'm using is the original Bradygames guide
---
That's what is officially said, but imo Blizzard has been thinking, perhaps in active production of, their own version of Classic WoW for a while. Probably before they shut down Nostalrius. 
---
whats so scary to you about server transfers?
---
The one thing that makes vanilla servers actually good - communities. They die the second transfers and such are opened. It's one of the big reasons people don't want sharding. 
---
I enjoyed my 29 twink Druid so much that I decided to level a second one that ended up being my main. This was very late vanilla though. I think I hit 60 like 3 months before TBC dropped. It’s really very nice being a god flag carrier, and in any battle ground you can be a huge difference maker as either feral or resto.
---
If that’s the case I’m going to guess July. 31 days post the next raid in classic. 
---
That's still way too early I would say.  
---
&lt;pet&gt; Pet’s pet
---
yes
---
server transfers dont kill communities, server transfers are the result of dying communities.
---
I'm in that middle picture.
---
If you're talking dps, go mining/blacksmithing &gt;weaponsmith &gt; make your Nightfall axe/whatever weapon suits your build, for early tasty dps, then drop blacksmithing, grab engineering &gt; gnomish, make your fun items (mind control helmet, etc.), drop gnomish and relearn engi as goblin for the explosives, you'll still be able to use the gnomish items you've made AND you'll have the extra boom from the goblin schematics.
---
Most guilds will have a Discord - just create a chat channel for looking for group and join that :-)
---
unlikely. “you think you want it, but you don’t.” statement came after nost was shut down. it wasn’t until reboot projects kept showcasing a large core fanbase that blizzard’s eyes turned into dollar signs.
---
You only need to reach Unfriendly reputation for them to stop attacking you. Also be sure that "At War" is unchecked in the reputation window to avoid accidentally attacking one
---
As in the discord server? Sorry for not clarifying.
---
Warrior tank
---
Priest healer
---
2x Mage
---
Warlock.
---
Perfect* group.
---
I know its a touchy subject but will there be balance changes in the future? Some people argue that 1.12.1 was the most balanced patch, even though it only saw live action for 4 months. Others state it lacks variety when it comes to class specialization. (raids consisting of 65% Warrior/rogue dps as opposed to anything else). I would also like to know if they will fix any of the exploits in main cities that let enemy factions glitch in and kill people unnoticed, etc.. 
---
Thank you for your response, even though that dashes my hopes of having another ungodly 39 twink. 
---
pre patch 1.7 hunters had 3 spots because they had a variety of choices for special animals with distinct actions. After they "balanced" this out, its just up to you. 
---
Considering most streamers will probably be pvping and horde has always had a strong PVP presence in the community, they will probably roll horde. When it comes to WPVP, prepare for stream sniping because only an idiot would broadcast your location to the whole world. 
---
I don’t want to be the same faction as them.  Stupid imo
---
I was in a great social guild, no one knew anything about the game, we all learned as we played. I rolled a warrior, leveled prot to help the guildies always run dungeons, and had a blast.
---
 Not long after finally hitting 60, a friend who was in a hardcore guild got me an invite to some raid thing, he said it was like 'melting core' or something, and I needed to tell everyone in the raid I was a "tank", because he had told them I was a really great one, whatever that meant. I said, "er...what's a tank? Like, I have treads and a big gun?", and he laughed and said "just hit things". So I showed up to MC, supposedly as some amazing tank, with my cool dagger equipped. And no CTRaid addon. And on the second pull, when a patrol got accidentally pulled, I was told to "grab the adds", and I asked on Vent "what are adds?"...
---
/shame
---
I just don’t want to play same faction as sodapoppin asmogold etc.
---
There are two quests in Felwood - one bottom and one top, by the entrance (bit higher level). Doing the bottom one + few extra mobs and you got the rep. The top one needs few extra levels to do (or team).  
---
I can't tell which is worse. The video which contains a total of 3 pixels and a shitty music overlaid instead of the game soundtrack, or the video of the guy walking while choosing which pet he wants out, after which he teabags Mograine. Nice. Real nice.
---
Are they starting with 8 debuffs or 16?
---
Originally Blizzard announced that World of Warcraft would be a subscription + the original retail price because they were going to use the subscription to fund FUTURE CONTENT (remember those expansions we paid for.... that future content was supposed to be covered by subscription cost) and server prices. Basically, the sub was like pre-ordering DLC that hadn't been made yet and putting it on layaway to pay monthly installments on. Only to be forced to buy said content that was created with the money you had already paid for. Insane imho. 
---
&gt; As in the discord server?
---
No. You're doing this because you want to make a guild in Classic, right? _Which time zone_ will that guild be in? Let's say you personally are on the US east coast. Since you're not _telling us_ that, that means that random people from all over the place are going to join your chat, and then six months from now, what happens? You make the guild on a US east coast server, and then anybody on the west coast who joins ends up stuck with 300ms latency.
---
Nobody wants that. So _tell people where you are_.
---
This is day 1 crucial information in any "join my guild" post.
---
No one knows. Roll Alliance to reduce the advantage melee DPS have in early raid content, melee aren't quite as good without windfury and when casters have salvation.
---
I think you're right, if the community isn't fun, the game isn't fun.
---
Obviously, there are many unique about Classic WoW which allowed it to cultivate and hold onto such a good community. (It also made interacting with them fun, interesting and necessary.) But that's not what this post is about.

This series has been helpful so far for getting me started. I haven't finished the whole thing though. You can just skip the stuff that's obviously skippable as an experienced programmer.
