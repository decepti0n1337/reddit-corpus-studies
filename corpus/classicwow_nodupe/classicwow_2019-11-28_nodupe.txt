&gt; There are 8 zones to level in 50-60. And all of them are camped to shit because there are 7000 hordes on at a time.
---

---
That's not what I am talking about. On the journey from 50-60 you have to touch all of those "eight" zones because there's not enough quests for you to do in one zone to get you to 60, or even close to that. 
---
As I said, even if the population was lower, you'd still be fucked because you'd have a lot of people completely crushing other players in zones that they ***have to level in*** in order to progress in the game. You could pick two or three end game zones say, Winterlands, EPL, and WPL and completely shut it down with Vanilla Pop. Cap players. 
---
Because you have an educated player base that is highly mobile and organized playing a 15 year old game that is a known game. There's no secrets. No hidden shit and all the "routes" are common knowledge. 
---
Not to mention there's also a psychological effect going on here too! 
---
&gt; [Learned helplessness.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) is behaviour exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated aversive stimuli beyond their control. It was initially thought to be caused from the subject's acceptance of their powerlessness: discontinuing attempts to escape or avoid the aversive stimulus, even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented.
---
That's why I keep saying that the "population cap is too high!" argument is pointless. That's a moot argument to make because it wouldn't change the outcome of your experience even if the cap was pop caps in Vanilla. 
---
Think of games like WoW as amusement parks. What's the best way to "soak up" guests and get them to a certain part of the park, or spread them out? 
---
***Rides***.
---
That is why Blizzard is pushing BGs ahead of schedule. That should ***hopefully*** soak up some of those excess wpvp that are looking to do some damage. 
---
Other than that your only other option is to do stuff like Layering or Realm Mergers. There's a reason why Blizzard used that tech in retail. 
---
However, Blizzard doesn't seem to want to do anything to change how Classic feels and runs. 
---
And while it may suck ass that you got your shit pushed in all the time, the opposite faction is also having fun too. That's the risk you took to play on a pvp server.
---

World chat is just a user made channel.
---
sHOulD oF RoLleD on pVE SeRVer
---
Thought that was going in a different direction.
---
So clearly not worth the gold/hr. Was curious.  Thanks.
---
BGs don't give experience until some time in cataclysm.
---
Possibly they are today to prevent filthy criminals like me from taking advantage, but they werent in 2005-06.  They had the activation code on them ready to be used.
---
Haven't they said that bindings were actually in the loot table and just didn't drop for anyone by chance?
---
MC has probably been cleared more total times now in classic than it ever was during the entirety of Vanilla.
---
On my server the ally camp and farm the horde by a huge margin even though the populations are reasonable close.
---
HEY EVERYONE I AM RIGHT HERE
---
HEY HOW DID YOU FIND ME NO FAIR
---
Fuck, it's Goldeneye on the N64 all over again.
---
Hey man aren’t you here too? Back up off his nuts.
---
All of them should be like this and I wish you could be banned from trade too. If you are looking for a group post in LFG, the clue is in the channel name.
---
&gt; I have a shadow reflector.
---
Yeah he's bad. 
---
&gt;Honestly all he could have done to help his chances was sac his pet before the duel started
---
That's standard for SL warlocks vs warriors. You get no rage and get to impotently white hit me through a 2x 2.5k shield.
---
Whenever lvl 60 Hordes aren't camping on the roof of the inn and every inch of the road, you mean.

&gt;twitch bad

This sub is a fucking salt mine, lol

Show me that smile again! Don't waste another minute on your cryinnnn!

A source in BRM had 250 (max?) on his spy
---
I know, but really.
---
Is there a parse log somewhere showing that HoJ causes bears and cats to hit twice? I've never heard of any effect on anything doing that to natural weapons
---
Theres a rogue that spends all day every day following Payo around and sapping / ganking him - literally have not seen a single Payo stream that he hasn’t done it. The guy really has something personal against Payo and seems to have a lot of spare time. Thats the guy who needs a ban (from WoW).

Me and a buddy are druid/lock. Hots and dots all the way
---
If used, it's also curse of agony in particular. It ticks away til it just starts *slamming* and that can make threat changing at that point harder. In my experience warlocks seem to be one of the classes to pull aggro the most, though it could just be who I've gone with like DoTing up EVERYTHING with tanks that can't quite manage that.
---
Somehow this feels accurate.
---
I was almost offended, but no guild leader sounds like too much work.
---
Well the inverse is true for Gnomeregan, oh wait...
---
That’s fine - it’s apparent that your opinion on what’s happening in Hong Kong doesn’t hold much value to you either.
---
There is a store in my area that has a sign advertising their sales on "1000's of items."
---
Every time I see that sign my blood pressure spikes 50 points and I want to spike a baby.
---
Yeah, seeing if the prices spike on release.
---
Naw, it's not that I'm thick, it's that you're of THAT type, u/RussLynch46 -- your comment history is just you going around telling people they're wrong because you're desperate for recognition and validation because deep down? You know the reality is you're a boorish cunt with nothing to say.
---
Like, sorry Mom didnt hug you enough and Dad make you take baths with him, but don't come chirping to me looking for attention by being a contrarian, mate.
---
Using the fist weapon Eskhander's instead of a sword or axe (with Edgemaster's if necessary) is roughly a 50 DPS loss, when compared to easily obtainable alternatives like Thrash Blade. However, without Edgemaster's, the fist weapon is slightly better than Thrash Blade for those without any weapon skill items. But a DPS has no good reason for not getting a weapon skill item - if they can't get edgemaster's, they at least should run the Expert Goldminer's Helmet or go daggers with free dungeon drops like the Distracting Dagger or Mugger's Belt. This makes it a niche weapon for non-human/orc tanks who don't want to give up armor to wear Edgemaster's while tanking.
---
Last I checked those two channels were taken over by a guild and passworded so I've never seen them
---
What does "world" give a clue about? That its all everywhere? That its not trading? 
---
The owners of the channel changed the rules from 1 day to anyother without warning.
---
You sound mad, are you mad?
---
not sure how long this is good for but heres a discord link https://discord.gg/w2Mt25
---
Faction specific queues would be a start imo.
---
Cry me a river
---
Too vague, what server and where?
---
Depends what I sell twink stuff for. Also, I caught up on all my shows so totally worth.
---
Doing it before the duel starts is generally considered bad form, like the warrior bloodraging then battleshouting and deathwishing, bandaging up, and starting the duel. It also never happens in world PvP if you get the jump.
---
The point of the reflector isn't to catch actual reflects (though that is always a good laugh when it does) - it is to deny all spells for 5s. After the fear that lock is either in execute range or dead - it clinches the deal.
---
The best attempt he had was when he gave up on the void and used a succ, managed to deny the fear. He actually hit me before he died!
---
I always shackle in scholo. But then I'm not an idiot and always let the tank pull, then shackle after. If there was a paladin tank who can't help break the shackle, then yeah nevermind I'll do without.
---
I thought they were mainly on Horde territory? If you're flagged for PvP you can only blame yourself. Alliance don't have a choice.
---
Reading and actually being able to understand all the quests.
---
As I said, happens to us horde on Felstriker all the time. I get it.
---
I get more satisfaction from having to put more time into doing everything, makes it more nostalgic so not really
---
Horde have a teleported to it, and it’s literally 1 dungeon, not 7
---
These people were toddlers when vanilla was out, so it's no surprise the participation trophy generation can't handle PvP.
---
This reminds me of all the idiots who would bitch about getting ganked in BFA and had warmode on, then eventually got a fucking handout from blizzard because of all the crying.
---
You wont consider replacing it until serpent shrine cavern in tbc.  Even with the nerfed threat it still was insane.
---
Honestly levelling with a voidwalker teaches you about threat management so well compared to other classes. Even hunters don't care so much if the mob aggros on to them with all their kiting ability.
---
Considering there is a post about a warlock tanking onyxia!
---
I’ll be ordering a steak from the labour club in like 55mins.... I’ll have to come back here for the seasoning.
---
If your tank is geared to use a dagger ie 305 daggers from equipment, then your mt should get it, no point in having your dps overgear your tank and have to not do max dps because he can't produce enough threat
---
Point out on the doll where the horde touched you.
---
Don't generally keep logs myself, but it's fairly well known among druids. Things like, say, Frost Oil don't work, because those specifically target the weapon, but things that happen on attack generally still work. 
---
There are some individual oddities like Counterweights that don't seem like they should work but do. Druid gearing is strange.
---
Imagine moving the goalpost so that no matter what anyone says you come up with an excuse to justify your childlike mentality.
---
Me and my buddy fought a skull level alliance player last night and beat him, then he called 3 more of his guys to come stomp us. It’s just part of the reality of open world pvp
---
Depends on your pop and active PVP participants. We don't have that much participation (I placed 78th with 12k honor). Our top 20 were mostly IF camping rogues.
---
Lol please, list your server
---
cs bs thistle tea bs cb evis. this ends anything other than plate.
---
My friend used to play games with a mouse and a wii knunchuk might be something to consider if you had one around
---
In terms of pure gameplay such as fp locations, zones, and inns, you're correct. In terms of player experience, not so much. Horde will typically kill and leave whereas allies will camp and grief for extended amounts of time. Not saying it's 100% of the time, but a marked difference between the factions. This is from personal experience leveling both factions on retail and multiple "freelance" servers.
---
False, he never said that he is sniping. Check his conversation with Staysafe the other day, he said that he used to do that before he started his Twitch channel and "reformed" later. He also showed how easy it is to find anyone, pretty much what I explained in my previous comment. Just pick an opposite faction player, use these methods to find them and see for yourself.
---
No, we don't have a hub from where we can get to any point on the map in 5 minutes.
---
The title nochanges is more than likely referring to the fact that this classic hunter trope is still alive today. Thus the dynamic of hunters rolling "need" on less than ideal gear hasnt changed
---
It's because poly has a different cast time and they're used to doing it like that with sheep. In fact, often an experience tank will ask the mage to start sheeping one then immediately do his ranged attack after he starts, and the tank will get first aggro still. Doesn't work with shackle, obviously.
---
The first time around, hardcore alliance raiders on my server rolled horde alts to help out. It was a coordinated effort outside of the game itself between the top horde and alliance guilds.
---
Was he a mage?
---
Have you had any good experience farming lashers in DM with warlock?
---
the STV one is generally what they prey upon. That flags you the second you switch over and hooo boy. Do they go to town like a drop of blood in a pool of piranhas.
---
 ofcourse I'm orc! I got to experience the bre in vanilla. It was an amazing sword. But deep down i always wanted to have a spinal reaper! Got it 2 weeks ago, and it has been living up to all expectations!
---
True, and yet the game has decided that half of my raid's MC loot will be warlock tier and the other half druid tier, every week since launch.
---
Felnarion is alive and well.
---
Got to admit, even up till 57 as Fury, i often tank with a 2h in berserker stance.
---
This isn't truly vanilla, i was doing 20+ dps at level 20 and the list is endless of the changes but long story short;
---
As long as your healer is reasonably geared, they can heal you tanking with a 2-hander in berserker stance.
---
If they try to tell you otherwise just kick and replace them for being lazy.
---
Maeve he lost his patience
---
Wpvp for a rogue is like a sushi bar, you just wait till a good piece comes by and you ambush it.
---
No he is a druid and said he has threatplates and it showed him what buffs i have on
---
Yeah, if he did that I'd have an issue with it so I guess it's a good thing he never did anything of the sort? You can't seriously be comparing willingly donating to streamer for entertainment with actual scams involving lying to people?
---
They don't have any. Only consecrate, which needs a tick to happen. Enough time for mobs to run out of it again or even kill the healer.
---
In my experience with classic so far, there's a disconcerting amount of WoW players who play while intoxicated. Maybe he was blackout drunk and scrambling for the frostbolt key.
---
Thanks for sharing! I feel a bit of that as well. I was a tank back in the day and certainly moved slower than we all do now. The point was to kill things and have fun together. However, there were certainly people back then just as focused on min maxing and taking runs way too seriously. 
---
I think you’re describing something very real. The desire for achievement and to be making progress is how we ended up with retail. Many people want it. Hell, to some extent I do too. It doesn’t feel great to run an instance and leave with nothing more than a big repair bill. I’m not sure how we tread a fine line between the two. What I’ve settled on is finding guilds and friends who are fun to play with and going on adventures with them. I’ll go help someone farm mats or run for their BiS because getting them a drop is fun and exciting for me just like seeing someone level was. I’ll form groups on the fly to push back the enemy faction (I’m trying to embrace pvp after hating it).
---
Hope you regain your enjoyment or find a new game that you enjoy!
---
BettervendorPrices works perfectly, thank you very much!
---
As someone who also played multiple "freelance" servers with larger populations, none of them felt like this personally. But I also have 2 ally 60s. One on a 4/1 server I don't touch and another on a 3/2 server
---
Now imagine being pvp flagged no matter what, and 20x more gankers and that’s the life of alliance. You can at least afk in town to become unflagged but alliance can’t
---
thinking of trying classic wow, is it still worth starting now? Like is it still fun to play classic wow after a few months? Not sure if its gonna be worth my time. How fun is the leveling experience so far?
---
Nice, same! 
---
Hope to see you around one day.
---
I wish you guys had something like that. The honor farm we could do on all the people AFK in the inn. Oh lord. Let me tell you. There is like a group of at least 15 flagged AFK 60s not near any npcs you could aoe the heck out of in Kargath inn. a few mages sneak in with invis potions and they could reap like 2k honor in a minute flat.
---
[removed]
---
Rez so we can gank you again
---
how do you afford the 100g a week for respecing?
---
Why didn't you roll on a PvE server?
---
How is this reply in any way related to what I posted?
---
Spriest on flag carry / flag room defense is t1 with a rogue.
---
PvP is one thing but an Armada of Alliance/Horde constantly nuking every person of the opposing faction 24/7 in every PvP zone is fucking stupid.
---
Both, ideally.  I think it's kinda nuanced when to use which (or both).
---
Depends on nearby mobs and nearby allies.
---
You think everyone here in this sub played vanilla? Get real. Honestly, you can tell who plays horde by the snark toxic attitude they immediately have with no input into the discussion whatsoever. It's actually comical, this version of classic has more 60s than original classic. You have no idea what you're even talking about but thanks for the PvE is the answer to every Ally on a PvP server response. Super original
---
Only people who could think this are other horde players. Since you can’t talk cross faction.
---
I don't see your point, he hasn't talked about Taliesin literally since the drama months ago, it's not like he brings it up every five minutes or something. At the time he was upset over it, sure, but that was for a day or two and he's moved on.
---
so?
---
Oh gee, I don't know, because Asmon is one of, if not, Twitch's largest streamers and has massive pull with them. So even though Advertise had stopped ganking him, Asmongold was still a butthurt little baby and got Twitch to ban him.
---
Then how come he saw an enemies dire maul tribute buffs while in ironforge?
---
yw, shield  slam is also ok dps, and  if you need  further control use concussion Blow. Enjoy.
---
OP has died from Natrium Chloride poisoning and chosen to haunt this subreddit :p
---
Because Blizzard didn't have the foresight to realize where players would camp. They were also atrociously biased in favor of the Horde.
---
"Hmm let's see. Menethil harbor, the main transportation hub of the Alliance, nested in a contested zone. A couple of level 39 guards on the corner of the dock ought to do the trick!"
---
"Zeppelins for the Horde. Both hubs in Horde territories. No PvP flags for hordies. Let's give them a massive tower garrisoned with several city guards! Can't have those pesky Allies ganking Hordies freshly arriving from contested zones!"
---
battleshout buffs your ap and does nothing for aoe threat
---
It’s clickbait. It’s a video game. You obviously have never watched a stream of his for a prolonged period of timez
---
I'm no min/max'er but I'd definitely go with the gutgore and combat daggers over dal'rends
---
Imagine thinking he's serious when he posts things like this
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exCdO2lKEHQ
---
Just go give Asmon another 5 dollars so you can whimper as he says your name.
---
Why because he’s not an idiot? It’s clearly harassment lmao
---
Pretty sure Advertise made sure to not stream snipe and instead used alliance spies etc and other information. There's not any proof of him actually having his stream open. Pretty sure asmon and esfand also told their followers to report him. Which I'm pretty sure is against tos

---
This is hilarious, I'm a 60 gnome mage on a 2:1 horde imbalanced server.

You keep getting frustrated and making these absurd claims, but you should take a step back and realize not everything is as black and white as you paint it to be.
---
&gt;You have no idea what you're even talking about but thanks for the PvE is the answer to every Ally on a PvP server response. Super original
---
Sure thing, but you really should learn how to adapt and overcome instead of complaining, it's a rather bad mentality to have.
---
Google says end of 2005 was the first oceanic.
---
Do you currently play classic?
---
That’s a video game. We’re talking about REAL LIFE harassment. How is making content off other people’s content harassment.
---
Man this world have such weird priority.
---
asmon doesn't get camped like that when he doesn't stream though
---
a lot harder to find someone when they're not streaming even if you know what zone they're in
---
Thanks!
---
For someone new to the game, you're doing just fine. There's a lot to learn, and you get better over time of course. Enjoy the learning and leveling experience. What realm and faction?
---
Why fast weapon for tanking?
---
r/woosh
---
At that point ur just having threat issues. If you cant time a conc tic as a mob is running towards you thats on you. Plus literally any action causes more threat than a cc. My faerie fire is enough to pull a groups attention off the mage that poly'd. In the end communication is key and a tank should be the one calling the shots on how pulls start IMO. But to say this is not a proper way to pull because you havnt experienced it or know how is just narrow minded
---
Shit I play while stoned as fuck and I'm definitely casting frost bolt as often as possible
---
Blizzard knows the type of crying this shit would bring.
---
They already catered to these idiots in BFA by giving them welfare 400 gear because they were too dumb to turn warmode off and somehow felt entitled to the same rewards.
---
This is why I'm so glad that they're bitching about a game state that cannot and will not be modified. Eventually the problem will sort itself out.
---
Every single crying post I see about classic PvP being "broken" brings me comfort in knowing how badly this all backfired on them.
---
Asmon also has a burden of proof and neither he or Esfand could prove it.
---
I also imagine there were a lot less of these kind of guys around 15 years ago.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFXcHC2xDQM
---
Listening to that, as well as those clips from that jokerd guy ninja looting among many others, puts a voice to all these tryhard spastics and griefers I've encountered or heard about.  People that constantly go on about their gear or some gank..bragging about some raid.. posting damage charts all the time.. they have this gogogo mentality and care only about their loot/score/efficiency or whatever and not the actual real people behind the avatars helping them.  These types are so prevalent now in all online gaming. 
---
Watching that video all I could think was I'm too old for this shit.. should prob go back to singleplayer games.
---
Why are you wasting your healer's mana standing in melee range with aggro from the pack when you have 2 mages?
---
Depends on the pull
---
If it's in scholo, for example, I can do that assuming that the puller knows the los the pull to bring them back to me.
---
It also means that I have less rage to build threat with since I can't charge in if I'm put in combat (irrelevant in the previous example of course).
---
It's not that I can't get aggro back, it's just tougher.  
---
It will be a more relaxed dungeon experience if all dps focus fire on one enemy and let the tank pull. I think that's pretty much all that's needed
---
The issue with that idea though is that you really can get away with a LOT with the easier soloable content. It's entirely possible to be slightly more reserved in your DoTing while sending a voidwalker into a pack a three, tab targetting to use torment for a bit of extra threat on each, and then just mopping up the last bits of health when the voidwalker just completely loses aggro. Fear can effectively CC one of a pack, and a couple of bursty abilities (even those that generate extra aggro because who cares at that point) can you down to just managing "one" mob in your face, which is doable if not dealing with it for a long time. If your target is one prone to fleeing you don't even have to slam them as hard and can just let them run and die from Dots.
---
Thanks guys I'll probably switch over to the warlock and have some fun. I'm not sure I can stick to a class with the premise of maybe I'll like it later on. I am playing a game to have fun after all, might as well do what I enjoy!
---
I'm guessing he's talking about instances. In theory you could just level in RFC, WC, SFK, RFK, SM and RFD and never have to leave a non-contested zone.
---
Even Staysafe is a fucking idiot. There's not many classic streamers that aren't absolute spergs
---
They? The player that became the channel owner is named in your screenshot. He did this to be an ass, happens every once in a while on every single server.
---
When I was in Goonswarm there was a meetup and one player showed up and stabbed another player in the parking lot.
---
You don't get that kinda drama in other games!
---
Playing the game is  not harassment. You're the biggest *b-word* imaginable. 
---
Go hug yourself and cry for a safe space from the bad man on the internet.
---
This exactly why 39 is popular though. It changes the meta. No mounts. No lvl 40 class abilities. No plate armor. And that’s entirely the point. 
---
It’s not about fighting 60s. It’s about dominating battlegrounds and other players in those battlegrounds. That’s the purpose of a twink. You have a huge advantage against non-twinks in your level bracket . Most twinks aren’t made to kill 60s. Though surely some can.
---
A disc priest will struggle to keep up with DPS in raids, shadow is really the only way priests can keep up with some of the dedicated DPS classes.
---
You'll still have good healing though, which is always nice.
---
Lmao this is so true
---
I went for world drop BOEs like flurry axe first, before anything else, because I expected the price of them to go up over time. So far this has been true on my server. Since the epic mount price is fixed in gold terms, I am not worrying about it. I don't know whether it's too late to take advantage of this phenomenon, but it's certainly possible (or likely, to judge from vanilla) that the prices will continue to go up on things like flurry axe.
---
Raid drops can be weird and you might yet end up using some swords if you see a lot of them in raids. Being the raider with edgemaster's makes it efficient for the group to give them to you, especially if you've already got a lot of orc warriors. Not every drop can be perfect bis, so the gloves can still be useful for improving raid dps.
---
As someone who primarily enjoys questing and leveling over endgame (call me crazy), I really dislike the idea of bonus xp. One reason I can't stand retail is how fucked up the flow of questing through old zones is.
---
Like other said, ignore how long you take. You'll learn as you go, don't be afraid to ask questions but be prepared to ignore the trolls and assholes usually you'll get a couple of dumb replies but some pms from people who will help you out with stuff. If someone is helpful add them as a friend and hit them up if you are stuck on what to do or unsure of something.
---
Last time I heard a story about two broken arms on reddit it didn't go as one would expect.
---
Alliance with Aged Core Leather Gloves (+5 to daggers)  
---
Perdition's Blade / Distracting Dagger - 764.4 dps  
---
Perdition's Blade / Core Hound Tooth - 764.0 dps  
---
Perdition's Blade / Core Hound Tooth / Mugger's Belt - 761.6 dps   
---
Seems like it factors it fine to me.  It knows that +10 weapon skill is worse than +5 with a better belt.
---
it doesn't matter if a carrier pidgeon dropped the location IRL, he's still harassing another streamer. Twitch the company has no way to tell how he's getting the info, and isn't going to just assume he's getting it himself when another, more profitable, streamer is being inconvenienced as a side effect of advertises existence. It seems fairly simple to me, either gank asmon all day and don't stream, or stop ganking asmon and stream.
---
Where was I making excuses for the  behavior? Moron.
---
You could've had that but you were half a second late on your keyboard turn -&gt; back peddle combo. Close though.
---
Be the first one to log in and join world chat after a reboot and it's all yours.
---
a mage has detect magic
---
He should get good or reroll pve
---
Nothing.  Asmongold just bitched about it nonstop.
---
After seeing this I feel like I really dropped the ball on not doing this.
---
He was a druid not a mage
---
Don’t build a ton of threat on your kill target. Let DPS rip it off you and taunt it back and then hold it with 1-2 sunders until it’s dead. Taunt shouldnt be something you hang onto. Use it to generate threat by taunting mobs that you arent trying to keep aggro on. This lets the DPS generate threat for you. You’ll have to be a little quick to snap it back before it runs too far, though.
---
Spread out your auto-attacks and sunders by changing targets frequently. Auto attacks are excellent threat.
---
Never use thunderclap in 5 mans. It’s threat-per-rage is not good enough, and you’ll be rage starved a lot.
---
At &gt;=6 mobs, spam Demo shout. Otherwise, only use it once on engage at &gt;=4 mobs to stabilize threat against the healer.
---
Shield Bash (yes the interrupt, not the talent) is good threat per rage (no, it doesn’t matter if it actually interrupts something.)
---
Talk to your DPS if a pull goes badly die to poor targeting. They can wait a bit later to start. If they don’t, keep talking nicely. You’ll know its them and not you, and so will everyone else.
---
Post content is trash
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
heading is true though, I've leveled enough of both factions and yeah the general questing experience and paths you follow are easier and faster for the average leveler than alliance.
---
I don't watch either of these people, I just hate Twitch and the way they enforce their ToS. Want to link me said video?
---
Faerlina and alliance
---
Should’ve not rolled on a pvp server, no?
---
Yeah literally no other streamer does this /s
---
Not according to the warrior discord that I've been gleaning information from, but I haven't personally tested it.  I have seen it mentioned in a few places (but I still rely more on demo shout for aoe threat).
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Threat-Mechanics#threat-values
---
Yeah I’ve tanked Onyxia like 4 - 5 times for all of phase 3. If you don’t get a threat wipe from fireball you’re gonna be tanking, so you want to lip to avoid the initial fear to get in position before aggro (or fear ward).
---
Once you’re in position Boss will transition off warrior, you should have already given your healers the heads up in comms, with healthstone ready and ideally at as high mana as possible. You don’t want to life tap at all unless you must, in which case do it after a breath and you’re healed up.
---
As for how you hold aggro, shadowbolting is fine. She’s immune to fire, so don’t bother with searing. It’s likely if your warriors aren’t shit, they’ll pull back off you towards end of fight, that’s on them to handle it appropriately.
---
Source: Asch, 99% parse multiple times on Onyxia even tanking
---
Anyone who has ever played on a PvP realm should of predicted this.
---
In WoD alliance reigned supreme because humans had the best PvP racial. Many players have no true affection for thier faction, they just want to be on the side with greater practical benefits 
---
Plenty of people such as rifkin and alexsensual rolled drawf even though they despise that race just to get fear ward
---
Random Alliance do this what's your point?
---
What a dumb comment. Making a career of playing video games 18 hrs a day isn't utterly pathetic? Ur probably watching asmongold all day aswell.
---
Is there any word on paid server transfers (I.e. To servers with a higher pop)? I understand they are not a thing as of right now but may be
---
Well, it does looks better than the original. But if you look closely, there is some of that eery artifacting going on.
---
No, its a whole clan called "mount reserved" that pass leader along them.
---
He didn't say at once.  He said 2 groups.
---
Why did you even roll pvp server?
---
To be fair, the neck from SM can be kept till 45-50's, without seeing a huge upgrade. It's a real nice one!
---
Still, it's not worth getting that upset over lol.
---
The hell????He did nothing against Tos he just played the game!This is bullshit , streamers even threatened him with ban and it worked. 
---
Barely watched him but this is seriously making me pissed off!How is playing the game bannable????
---
Guessing he's referring to itemization problems and the related ninja looting issues (a hunter needing ravager just because he can technically use it, for instance).
---
i bought 7 of these , but i'm getting really bored of leveling alts XD
---
What I said has nothing to do with faction imbalance. People have been camping zones that have characters lower level than them vanilla launched. Everyone wants to stomp stomp someone with shittier gear than them in wPvP.
---
3 raid nights a week semi casual? O.o
---
I turn 360 degrees and walk away.
---
Blizzard hasn't said a word about them.
---
Advertise is actually a good streamer. He will be fine after the ban if he plays it smart and leaves asmon out of his titles
---
Maybe message the guy who banned you? It's player owned lots of other servers have likely had randoms banning people and being jackasses on it.
---
tanks get tons of rage so faster weapon = more heroic strikes
---
People complain about anything. They're literally complaining about a situation THEY are helping to create... Why not complain about plastic while throwing a water bottle in the river while you're at it?
---
Yeah it's pretty weird... 
---
and even if he's using a second account (which is shady at best) the twitch harassment ban is still the right move.
---
Honorless targets should be dishonorable kills.
---
So happy my guild gave me a Deathbringer
---
Yeh! It's not like you can run mc again!! Grow up! /s
---
But he didn't stream snipe!!Where was the fucking proof??
---
Blizzard punishing you for not rolling undead (WotF), *and* not staying in berserker stance to avoid sap/fear/reckless charge.
---
It's almost too good
---
Yeah, there is. Horde has faaaar more of the scumsucking players than allies.
---
Just imagine for one second, rolling into a class to purposefully drag out every fight into a one sided slow button rotation for about a minute just for a few points of honor, and then get killed anyway. HAAAH thats what you get!
---
This. I couldn't agree more. If I run with guildies I can chain pull almost nonstop the entire dungeon and we clear fast, never wipe.
---
Replace them with a fury warrior who wants to charge in before I even put one global down on a big pack and all the sudden I can't get aggro on anything and people start dying because I don't have enough rage to build threat.
---
Rattlegore? This is my brother!
---
There's a hybrid disc/shadow spec where you keep up shadow weaving to buff the warlocks but primarily heal that would be nice to have if there are no shadow priests in your raid. But you aren't really doing much dps yourself in that spec, it's purely to buff warlocks and add in some heals on the side.
---
Eysilum PS was just as imbalanced, I stopped playing thier because most alliance I meet where not willing to coordinate and fight to survive while horde only appeared when they thought thier chance of success was over 99%
---
This.rest of servers don't care lol
---
The shaman is just griefing, but the hunter pet - that's a good troll right there. I bet he was a troll.
---
Ironforge?
---
The joke is the warrior wants the hunter to not roll on a weapon that is not particularly useful for them, but may be a solid upgrade for the warrior.  Every weapon is a hunter weapon is an ancient meme from 2004 when hunters were stigmatized as less than intelligent players and would roll on any melee weapon they saw as a minor upgrade (whether it was or not) vs passing to one of the classes in the group it was more appropriate for.
---
No changes in this context is the op, possibly a hunter, making the joke that if we truly support no changes, then this aspect of the game should continue in classic.  As previously mentioned, this scene from Full Metal Jacket shows the recruit not giving his weapon to the sergeant, even though he sternly requests it, just like a warrior might address a hunter for eyeballing a weapon more suited for the warrior.
---
This concludes How to absolutely ruin a joke by explaining it thoroughly theater.
---
To be fair here, ravager is actually a pretty damn good weapon for hunters
---
People are having a hard time realizing WoW =/= twitch.
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Yeah that's a no from me dawg.
---
What gets me is people who played vanilla wore it like a badge of honour for how broken it was. Now that classic is out it's the same broken imbalanced bullshit and everyone is like \*pikachu shocked face\*
---
its a whole clan, they are banning EVERYONE that types stuff like that. They also for a prief time had it password protected.
---
For leveling its whatever does the most dps. 
---
At 60 slower tends to be better so you can weave your abilities in during the downtime of your weapon.
---
Just because you keep repeating yourself it doesn't make it true.
---
You sound fun in a dungeon!
---
He didn't stream snipe and him playing the game isn't harassment ..this is fucking brain dead by Twitch!
---
Reddit is coping too hard because they where too dumb to roll on a pve server and now its everyone elses fault
---
Found this while browsing EPL.
---
Too many pve players rolled on pvp servers, if you don’t want to get fucked you gotta fight back
---
My theory is that people just hoped for the best and deliberately ignored past experience that showed the future
---
It's not for ganking but for talking shit and harassing another (partenered) streamer, it's against twitch TOS
---
At some point they will all be offline and somebody else will be the owner of the channel
---
Please don't ruin a PvE server with your characters. It's like becoming a millionaire in America, and then moving to a backwoods part of Africa: you will fuck up the economy and the culture, and then NO ONE will be happy.
---
Me too, like 15 years ago...
---
Random alliance do what? track and camp a specific opponent all night long as they move zones?
---
Random horde do that, whats your point?
---
It doesn't take a trained chef to know when food tastes like crap.
---
The fact that horde have such a clear and obvious advantage when it comes to PvP means that the servers could never be balanced IMO. Think about it, if the population of 1 server is 60 horde 40 alliance, and they give free transfers over to another PvP server specifically for horde members, where will the horde go? Because the PvP advantage is in favor of horde, there will likely be the same problem on all the other PvP servers. You will never have a perfect balance of 50/50 on PvP servers because its impossible to balance it equally like that. Just my 2 cents, inb4 the pvp nerds downvote me as usual
---
Probably an old private server grudge.
---
what even
---
You're fighting very undergeared warriors, it sounds like.
---
Warriors are autowins and Hunters are also pretty ez if you've got ingi to close the gap. Viper sting costs them more than you and they can't loose you once you're on him.
---
This.They just went to save crying Assmon cause he has way more viewers..Fuck Twitch.Also Assmon said he will stop streaming/playing classic then just do it instead banning good streamers
---
Dunning-Kruger effect, WoW Classic style.
---
are you a wizard
---
No, there isn't.
---
There are simply more horde dominant servers currently than there are alliance dominant servers. Any time either faction is dominant, its just particularly shitty for the other side.
---
You are kidding yourself if you legitimately think either faction is this game isn't pulling from the same damn group of people.
---
&gt;Look at heavyweight "professional wrestling" FFS
---
you don't understand the problem if you're making this comparison
---
You do past the first fear or if they catch you outside zerker.
---
He didn't snipe or cheat...
---
is he or are you?
---
That's hilarious
---
Yup, with a good group I can solo tank it. With a bad group, we barely scrape by with 2 tanks without wiping. I get tanks taunting off of me while another mob is running towards the healer or beating on dps.
---
Or they'll just quit because the reaction to that will be forums flooded with horde mad about how they are being punished for playing horde
---
&gt;Now imagine being pvp flagged no matter what, and 20x more gankers and that’s the life of alliance. You can at least afk in town to become unflagged but alliance can’t
---
IF/SW are in Alliance territory....
---
Nokytn (warrior) on Archimonde of guild Nurfed got it.  Nurfed had an in with blizzard back in those days after Indalamar's famous warrior video in beta, after which Indalamar was hired.  Indalamar eventually moved to work on Diablo 3.
---
Yeah it was funny for like a month
---
Me from Old Boys is the best.
---
Even on a server as Hydraxian Waterlords (EU PVE) dropping the head is an issue and it's a small server compared to most others.
---
This is one of the issues that we all knew was coming if it was #nochanges.
---
Berserk rage doesn't say it can be used to break fears etc only make you immune to them.Wotf clearly says it can break em. So warriors using it under fear is fine ?Was it like that back in vanilla can't remember that
---
I wonder if he turns off names in game if he can feign ignorance.
---
NANI?!
---
I have a feeling you're the type that say «go back to retail» when you gank a 55 with a 40 man raid. Try playing on the minority for 24h, and you will see how cancerous it is.
---
Hope you like salty popcorn
---
What else are we there for ? Whispered secrets is so nasty
---
Poison cleansing totem.
---
it's fascinating that you've genuinely gotten everything wrong, wow.
---
Thats when I generally intercept or, rage and totem choice permitting, int shout. If neither's an option, nade.
---
Warriors actually have a very solid interrupt rotation past pummel - you can keep someone from casting for a good while, it just is a damage sacrifice.
---
Lmao!
---
Players will choose whats best for themselves, its blizzards job to give proper incentives to achieve a semi balance. You can't just tell people to spend more, you need to drop interest rates to incentivize spending. How can so many people not understand this simple concept baffles me.
---
Conversation that has to do with the topic. Not something from the past.
---
&gt; Doing it before the duel starts is generally considered bad form
---
You do it when they charge of course, still should at most get one auto in.
---
&gt; After the fear that lock is either in execute range or dead - it clinches the deal.
---
Which goes back to my original point, that's a bad lock. There is no way a good SL lock is in execute range after 5 seconds against a fury warrior at this point. Unless you have the most insane gear imaginable youre not doing 10k+ damage in 5 seconds.
---
I wish I rolled Ally regardless of all this.. all my friends wanted to be horde so I'm stuck being here or being alone as an Ally.
---
Are you on Sulfuras!? We have an orc rouge named Me as well!
---
Dude what Arron takes your right bars and stacks them on top of the main two rows?
---
I will admit, I'm not fund of it either, as a male might elf. It just seems off lol....
---
Yeah this is how I have felt leveling up.  I used to grab random things from the ah.  Minor upgrades, fun pets, profession recipes, you name it. 
---
Now I just sell everything and try not to buy anything if I can avoid it, and I don’t see myself farming Tyr’s hand for months this time around.
---
Why do people keep spouting this shit as if everyone playing Classic tacitly wished to have no quality-of-life changes added to the game. We've had plenty of changes that negatively impacted QoL to begin with (server size, layers, etc).
---
Top panel are people who lucked out and randomly got on a good server. Middle panel are people who waited asked around and made sure to get on a good server. Bottom panel are people who have been on the very worst severs since day one who refuse to reroll or take free transfers.
---
This doesn’t work though, damage even through shields breaks the channel
---
No kidding? Dope, thanks.
---
Maybe in a different game, but WoW is designed to keep players out in the world and interacting with each other.  You do have the option to change how those interactions play out, for example you could change servers with the free transfer service or play on a different realm type.  Choose your own destiny!
---
I was the same as you. First time playing WoW and it took me like 5 straight night of playing a couple hours a night to get to 10. Didn’t really notice cause I was on discord exploring the world with my brother and cousin. 
---
Just enjoy the scenery and slaying boars. Levels will come
---
&gt;I really do not want to start from scratch, wiping out the past 3 months of work.
---
If you had fun doing it, it's not work.
---
I dunno if they released the server restrictions for classic (the did eventually in WoW) but I swear I hear something about adding in paid server transfers within free next 6 months
---
Or maybe it’s because Advertise’s entire career started and continues to revolve around harassing another streamer.
---
He literally got banned for harassment. This is ridiculous. 
---
It’s not some conspiracy. His entire stream is built around breaking the TOS lmfao.
---
Thanks for the walk to wetlands.
---
If they trinket the first 5 point kidney, how do you respond after that? 
---
As a resto druid, I trinket, abolish, nature's grasp, and start kiting. NS if I'm low (he crits everything), Swiftmend if not. How can I bait the rogue to use a potion other than a FAP? 
---
When they fap/prep I've been having trouble getting away, with my only success coming from faking out a kick.
---
Rattle Rattle
---
Lol. Quit if you think it's the right thing to do but don't tell others to quit then crawl back to wow to make your guild happy. Im sure the people in Hong Kong appreciate your honesty and integrity. But hey it's an anonymous website if you wanna play the hero card go ahead.
---
Wait but ravager is good on hunters. Definitely not as a priority over warriors, but still good on them. Hunters need weapons too....
---
What addon is this?
---
this is only in your heads. in reality those big groups are running around looking for other masses of enemies. but they arent going to pass up the quick kill however they arent thinking anything of it.
---
Nobody:
---
You: Reeeeeeee game is perfect, no criticize
---
Bruh. We aren’t talking about real life harassment. That would be a legal issue. We are talking about the twitch definition of harassment.  Think. Please.
---
Honestly leveling was amazing on my mage. I enjoyed 1-58. Warrior was good, but by the time I got to around 50 I stopped enjoying it. I got my leveling fill and really just want to do some end game content.
---
Read the post dumb ass
---
In general the people who are playing and not being griefed aren't going to come here to post that experience it's only the people having a bad time who will post.
---
No honor for them... so why complain? Rez and fly away.
---
Actually, he does get camped like that when he isn't streaming. I'm part of a raid group that actively search for Asmon, his alts and Pinksparkles to gank all day.
---
Yep, it goes both ways. My friend and I got attacked by a Paladin-Druid combo when we were lvl 54, and actually won the fight. We had about 10 seconds to enjoy the victory before a party of 60s with requisite Hand of Rag Warrior, 2 Frost Mages and 2 healers roll in and delete us. No point crying about it, though. Part of the game.
---
Twitch is what exactly?  
---
I gather it's like Youtube for kids who like to watch other kids play video games?
---
That sounds very sad.
---
When they were stigmatized? I think they still are.
---
You won’t even use a curse word and you are calling me sensitive lmao.
---
He broke the TOS. He got banned. And you’re sitting here triggered.
---
oh fuck no. old itemization was a big pile of garbage lol. also dont play on one of the "big" servers and youll have a way better time in the game.
---
Then yeah, I've seen others here mention world chat being taken on their servers too. It's a player created channel, not much you can do. I don't think it's really used on my realm.
---
*Fortunate Son intensifies*
---
Yep. Correct on all accounts.
---
Agreed, people are already doing 500+ dps with pre raid and a few raid upgrades gear.
---
People are seriously underestimating the power of 15 years of bis research and simulations.
---
Playing on a PvE server is like staying in 1st grade for twelve years and then saying you graduated.
---
I went engineering on my rogue just to have that 5 sec shadow reflect trinket for you bastards
---
Why would you be prioritized for 2handers in the future? You already have hand of rag lol.
---
The only thing that beats it is viskagg/x or BRE.
---
Nope.   
---
They're pulling from the same group of people, sure. But, if you don't think the horde side is pulling extensively more players who want a direct advantage over others, want to PvP more and is more attracted to the idea of punishing the other factions players, you're straight up kidding yourself.
---
While there is opportunity to shackle in scholo, I don't like the risk of some patrolling mob passing by it and aggroing. The place is real claustrophobic, and I'd rather just deal with the LoS pulls, myself.
---
And lose a massive timesink?
---
This gif displays Menethil Harbor, which has boats to Theramore and Darkshore.
---
Free transfer service is not a thing for everyone, seems like you're just going to ignore the problem this is trying to solve?
---
Fair enough, just keep in mind that Battlegrounds will be released in 12~ days and a lot of people that are after PvP will migrate to BG's instead of world PvP so this pvp-intensive period is only temporary.
---
My suggestion would be to try level an alt on a PvE server in the meantime, or keep your mage/warrior logged out near instances/raids that you want to attend so you can avoid the constant swarm.
---
Got it. You're straight up delusional. Thanks for confirming.
---
So if I am a human with edgemasters and deathbringer/mirahs
---
Third base!
---
It does good dmg in the current phase. Also good in pvp. Wep drops are all luck. If eye drops and you can craft then why not.
---
Nobody forced Asmon to roll a PvP server and divulge the names of his characters.
---
He shouldn't get any special protections from his own fuck up.
---
If he doesn't want to be stream sniped, he must roll a PvE server or not ever display the names of his alts.
---
It's common sense. If you give up an advantage on a PvP mmo, people will take advantage of it.
---
Camp the channel for 20 hours, unban them, ban "Nemeye".
---
&gt;so in 2019 harassing means killing in a video game. 
---
No that’s not what this is about at all. This is about him centering his twitch content and community around harassing another twitch partner, has nothing to do with killing in a video game.
---
Because I do more damage than the mages and that way they dont have to drink for every pull?
---
&gt;I'm glad were all able to find our safe spaces and act like adults
---
So you rerolled on a PvE server then? Great stuff! I'm sure it will be the environment you've been looking for.
---
&gt;Have a good day, friend :)
---
You too!
---
Battleshout is actually more threat than demo shout (since they fixed it) if you buff 4+ targets so in a pt with hunter and your shout buffs pet, but nowhere are really worth spaming I've found.
---
You are clueless bud, give it up. I'm sorry you are bad at warrior and have bad warrior friends.
---
Because not everyone takes part in PVP so 60:40 doesn't equal an automatic PVP landslide.
---
I have an alliance toon on a second account that I use to spy on positions of players 😉
---
I think you mean 10v1
---
i was planning on taking a break until the pvp frenzy slow down, now that i enjoy other games i will most likely don't come back at all
---
I, too, believe everything I read on the internet.
---
Asmon has more subs and makes more money than twitch. It's simple.
---
He gets a special privilege pass so the mmo can revolve around him
---
I feel like I saw a stormpike emissary in IF the other day, they were only present during the bg weekends right?
---
At 100 I believe you still get gains from smelting ore, so mine/smelt as high as you possibly can.
---
After that, basically just roam around zones and mine anything green/yellow/orange.
---
The +5 mining enchant is quite useful too.
---
When you get to about 225 mining~, you'll be around the level expected for your lvl45 character.
---
Yeah... My dumb as a rock (as far as WoW goes) Paladin likes to throw shade my way like I am a dummy for playing Hunter (Survival, guild asked me to, we were out of melee), while himself sits in melee and takes up the space of 2-3 melee with his terrible/greedy positioning, but nope, I'm the dummy because Hunter.
---
&gt;It isn’t true pvp.
---
Lol, yes it is
---
They're talking about moving from one continent to the other.
---
Rules are clear : Stream Sniping while Live is valid for sanction, he can have been at least less obnoxious.
---
Im currently tanking 5-mans as warrior, and gearing for Ony/MC. I used to be arms-prot, but with picking up Mirahs Song I noticed sweeping strikes/WW wasnt as effective and switched to fury-prot. I do wonder, should I spam Sunders or Bloodthirst when I use a shield? And do I also sunder when DW? Tried looking it up, but just makes me more uncertain. I also want to know, how bad is deep prot in solo content compared to fury-prot?
---
I dont expect 4 server crashes within an hour three months after release.
---
You did this.
---
&gt;WTF is "encouraging faction balance" supposed to mean?
---
It means "I want more people to help me since I can't handle PvP and need others to fight my battles for me"
---
The quest is available but you cant craft elementium.
---
fckn screen looker!
---
Curious as to how that happens in raid because for my guild as warlocks we're always relegating our curse slots to raud utility if some sort (Elements, Recklesness, Shadow, Weakness)
---
If you'd have just said "Summon me" instead of having someone else arrange it for you
---
Trash talking doesn't mean it's ok to harass.
---
Indeed you don’t want to taunt mobs that you are already on the top of the aggro list of. That’s a good point.
---
Taunt is an invaluable tool for generating aggro by planning for a ranged DPS to take aggro, and taunting it back. Ideally you can focus on the mobs DPS arent killing while using taunt in conjunction with the 130% aggro threshold to prevent you from needing to commit significant threat to the kill target while tanking multiple mobs.
---
You cannot loot a black lotus until at least level 35
---
I can only hope to meet you one day in game friend, maybe you can teach me how to hit glad again! But I'm not sure you actually play the game with how much you thoroughly enjoy reddit /new postings lmao
---
They can because any class can use a noggenfogger elixir. another way is to train engineering For a parachute cloak.
---
So real, Drood + Rogue are making shit ton of damage and are so hard to found / flyoff, there is no point in that  
---
genuine PvP does happen, its fun and all, but 3/5V1 is to often, if you are not 4 or 5 people traveling this happen.
---
It has always broke fear.
---
I'm not sure it's possible in currently available gear, especially since wearing plate usually means dropping a lot of damage stats.  I imagine phase 3 will make it a lot easier since you can pick up some good plate dps pieces in BWL. For now I'd run it 3 man.
---
To be fair, SM is lvls 28-42 for the majority of players in the "leveling meta" and 1/3 of the dungeons people do while leveling.
---
Haven’t seen Talisman, Mageblade, Staff of Dominance or Choker
---
ofc you did ;)
---
That's fine that you're leaving PvP realms, that is 100% what you should do if you're not having fun, and I encourage it. What isn't good, however, is bringing all of your stuff with you. Reroll as soon as you want, but just don't transfer your PvP character to a PvE realm, it's not fair to the existing PvE players.
---
Because alliance tend to be little babies who need to be coddled all the time.
---
There's a pattern here.
---
Nice, I got mine for 400g last week and water was around 17g, but since  idiots rule the ah the price dropped already &lt;14g...
---
I love idiots ruining prices....
---
Points at Arathi Highlands.
---
It's people who rolled PvP knowing exactly what it entails.
---
Was in Mags one time in TBC. This shaman's name was "Crooshal" and we all kept hearing in vent "This is crucial, I need wisdom" and my friends and I just found it oh so hilarious because the organizers and pallies kept asking for their name for a good 30 sec.
---
Best meme ever lmao
---
it's ok mommy is here to rub your tummy. such a big strong boy!
---
So trashtalking, in response to harassment, makes it ok for the guy to obssess over asmongold? ok dude.
---
&gt;I can only hope to meet you one day in game friend, maybe you can teach me how to hit glad again
---
I can honestly say there's nothing I'd enjoy less than meeting you in the game &lt;3 
---
&gt;But I'm not sure you actually play the game with how much you thoroughly enjoy reddit /new postings lmao
---
Or maybe I'm at work where I can't play. But keep making these assumptions, so far pretty much all of them have been completely wrong and I can't wait to see what the next one is.
---
Its easier to shakle and los. Also, scholo is low dmg. You don't need a tank just some one that can hold agro. You shakle because of silences and push backs. Much easier.
---
You just ignorant. It's waste of time. Good luck
---
He literally said why in his comment, nimrod.
---
I have two alts one is "Overthere" and the other is "Overhere" since its two words its a bit harder to pull off, but still funny in my book.
---
Literally lolling here. The only thing missing is stuttering but I'm sure he'd have if it wasn't written.
---
ally idiot lol
---
The reason I got hand of rag is because no one else wanted it.
---
GM almost had to force it one one of us before I offered to take it. After that he don't want to deal with that shit again so he wants a dedicated 2h warrior.
---
Hand of rag isn't that good tbh and a lot of later weapon surpass it in PVE damage. That's why I'm asking.
---
Without using thistle CS BS Gouge Kidney BS BS Blind Sap repeat but with an Evis
---
Let's see. There are 3x as many pvp servers as pve servers and every server had horrid login queues for a month.
---
This is not a player made issue
---
I don't think you can say a twink has any sole purpose that isn't subjective to the person playing it. I make my twinks so I can fight higher levels and surprise them with how hard I hit or how tanky I can be.
---
Typically, highest floor means even if you suck, your floor (i.e. you playing the worst you can) is higher than that of other classes. A bad rogue beats a bad shaman, for exanple.
---
Oh right so its only a problem because its between islands?
---
Maybe it's a massive issue effecting the game greatly?  As in it's actually, genuinely killing off player populations.
---
By obviously pretending (couldn't keep a straight face through it all) to be upset over not getting a name in a video game? Oh, yeah, some real Nigerian prince level manipulation there. People donate to streamers all the time, something cool or dramatic happening (he got lot more donations/primes first time he cleared Deadmines) increases that. 
---
Also I like how you immediately went to callimg me delusional.
---
Do you think you're an above average complainer by chance?
---
Cry me a river bitch
---
That sounds wonderful compared to currently a 45 min walk into an instance. Dying 10+ times.
---
30 min rant? he talks about that shti for atleast 2-3 hours
---
ok zoomer
---
What you just said is what a hunter would say.
---
Maxxed out with 200% res scale
---
You're a real above average player right
---
Its cause advertise isnt a big streamer/partner and Twitch is biased against small streamers
---
Same here. I have a super hard time mining thorium.
---
Merriam Webster disagrees with you, bud.
---
BG rewards just cause BG afking.  
---
It was one of the worst mistakes they ever made.  
---
Honor from BG kills works, bonus from 'just being there' is abusable.
---
Serious, do you have any credibility for coming off so smug for no reason? Lol
---
Ah yes, victim blaming.
---
It's very good given we're in phase 2 lol
---
Locks gnenerate more threat than prot paladins
---
how is that different from that orc rogue in vanilla that had an entire blog about ganking people and keeping track of them?  
---
people looked back at that as fond memories of the interaction between the players and so on, but now that is happening right now they dont like it, youthinkyoudobutyoudon't
---
You seem to believe that PvP realm characters have some advantage over PvE characters? Or am I missing something?
---
No one takes it because prot is a pve spec and stun resist is meh in pvp. And I’d skip over that with an arms spec because it’s nice but not something to make a build around. Orcs passively have more than double that too.
---
There's literally 1 alliance dominated server and like 3 balanced servers.  While it's true it's just the majority faction, when 20+ servers are all horde dominated, there's much more room to complain about horde.
---
Horde are just incredibly sensitive about it and whine about it.  They seem to think people are personally attacking them for 85% of servers being horde dominated.  That's not the case.. people don't really care about horde in particular, it's all just shorthand complaining so people don't have to caveat literally every single post.
---
Oh yeah for sure!
---
Don't get me wrong I'm excited af. Never thought I'd get a legendary :)
---
id suggest doing ungoro right now. Perfect for lvl 52 with 15-20ish quests. Will get you a whole level, and isnt as much gold at 60 as epl wpl ws.
---
After that just dungeons i guess
---
They are spies.
---
Only issue is with tryhards having a stigma against it.
---
With competent players on the same skill level, the Spriest is on par with the lowest pure dps class. However, you do contribute to locks getting a dmg boost, so part of their dps is "yours".
---
And you do bring some versitility as an extra dispeller, emergency healer and resser.
---
You are actively partcipating in a community centered around a kids game..
---
I know of this lol
---
Man you'd have to be nuts to spend money on HS, its a f2p game
---
wonder if ive ever vendored this
---
Why would you assume banned has to be permanent? Nowhere in the definition.
---
Pedantic for no reason and not even right.
---
Sure, I play on a PvP server and don't complain about PvP when PvP happens.
---
Do you have any credibility for rolling on a PvP server and complaining when PvP happens?
---
If you're old enough to know Rush Hour, you have no excuse for not knowing Abbott and Costello.
---
Found you, u/dumpsterthroaway. Here's some attention from u/QualtingersBalzac. u/QualtingersBalzac sends his regards. He does not like incorrect grammar, so watch out! He might get triggered and come after you!!
---
Head meet sand. Lmao
---
Are you trying to tell me they recycled jokes in the epic rush hour saga?
---
I've never seen BRD not be one sided. Its either a alliance camp ganking small groups, or massive zerg of horde
---
Winterspring + Western / Eastern Plaguelands are worth around 400g from quest rewards. (Not counting Dungeon quests)
---
yea, afk-valley was soooo much more fun in TBC....
---
&gt; Horde are just incredibly sensitive about it and whine about it
---
you mean alliance right? the only ones i ever hear whine and complain lmao.
---
Get over it, botjh factions are the same and you not being able to get that in your brain of yours isn't my problem
---
Its actually one of the better ways of farming honor, if you have no competition. There are a few ways of getting around the honorless target buff
---
make sure to downvote
---
Is all of your experience exclusively fighting warriors in greens and blues or something?
---
I currently steamroll SL locks. Back in vanilla, with my AQ40+ gear + dual deathbringers, I could kill them before they finished their dots. Shit, I could literally just push bloodthirst to burn through the sac bubble at that point.
---
You're either severely overestimating the value of EHP in the complete absence of control, or severely underestimating the damage output of a fury warrior that has hit the point in gear he starts to snowball.
---
Or maybe you just started playing in TBC? Once resilience stacking became a thing, SL drain tank could beat warriors. It did not in vanilla, far from it.
---
honestly its a zoomer thing to associate bans with suspensions. Back in the day if you were banned from a website or forum, you werent coming back lol
---
Priests can dispel that honor less debuff and ice block removes it same as bubble
---
I have to explain to Paladins DI on a nearly daily basis...
---
It’s painful.
---
Why yes, i am a lvl 60 horde. How cluld you tell?
---
I dont do this, however there may be no honor for the kill when they land but they either have to res or log out so its basically a stream of free honor if they choose the res
---
This is the way to do it, at least while tanking 5 mans. This is generally my exact opener. After whirlwind I'll usually switch into defensive, do a demoralizing shout and then toss a dynamite/bomb. While WW CD is ticking down I'll try to get a few shield blocks/revenge, maybe a sunder armor if I have a lot of rage. If I want to further reduce the damage I'm taking I'll pop into battle stance to drop a thunder clap for the attack speed debuff.
---
If the damage is really a problem I'll just switch from 2H to 1H+Shield mid-combat but the opening pull is usually done with a 2H. If I'm playing aggressively in a high damage scenario I'll even swap into the 2H just to get a WW off, then switch back while on CD.
---
Where's Thunderfury???
---
Hand of Rag sucks
---
For huhu you need 20 people with high nature resist to soak. If you aren't one of those 20 people, you don't need it. Huhu blasts the closest 20 people with nature damage regularly. So you get 20 people to stand closer than the tanks with major NR. When she gets to 30% iirc she goes ballistic and you need to kill her pretty fast or people start dropping quickly. If one of the soaks dies, the tanks can end up included in the "closest 20" and start getting blasted hard.
---
This was one way to do it that worked for us so many years ago. I don't know about other stats that may be comparable or better.
---
Applies to both sides, buster
---
Make my year and man up for once in your life,  link your armory my special beta friend
---
That has to be the loosest interpretation of harassment I’ve ever seen.
---
I saw many more people going into advertise’s channel and harassing him for ganking  Asmon than I ever saw in Asmond’s chat. 
---
But you didn’t see advertise whining about the Asmond spergs in his channel causing trouble. Most didn’t even get banned from his chat. 
---
Asmond has already made it clear in the past that he’s not responsible for what his chat does. 
---
So, advertise uses his stream name in his titles. Pretty sure it falls under fair use. 
---
So, did advertise actually harass anyone besides killing them in game? Did he send any messages to Asmond or his gf? In game or otherwise? No. That is what harassment is. 
---
While I don’t necessarily agree with everything advertise does, I’ve also seen him NOT gank Asmon just to be nice. 
---
I honestly can’t because that with all the shit Asmon talks that he did this. All because someone put him back in his place and he got butthurt. Well, don’t talk shit to thousands of people and be surprised when they hang you for doing it.
---
Don’t you worry baby. It’s only a 7 day suspension. He’ll be back in action soon baby!
---
wHaT sErVeR?
---
I'm a 60 druid, and like 80% of the times I get ganked, I just get stunlocked to oblivion by a rogue or paladin. Funny enough, mages loved to gank my ass while leveling, but I haven't been ganked once by a mage at 60.
---
Well, not by a lone mage, at least, 20 man groups are common. /shrug
---
You played a rogue?
---
I’m reasonably sure I removed all those , but will confirm. Thanks for the suggestion
---
You need *pvp* prebis gear, not pve.
---
There is no official world channel for looking for groups outside trade (have to be in a city) or general (have to be in the zone).
---
19 twink section was my favorite
---
got killed by xivia too, did ya?
---
I'd also highlight only strong at early leveling - the poor scaling already begins impacting you from like level 35-40 on wards. Level 40-55 Enhance struggles to kill two same level warrior-type mobs at once unless you blow through mana.
---
Gasp 6hours without a rule 7 smack
---
Okay defiantly don't try using your priest friends to dispel someone's buff that will never work it doesn't take off ai fort mark or any buff from opposing factions
---
You absolutely cannot compare private servers to an official server. Those are two completely different things.
---
I've done both and it's way better for horde. STV is waaaay more convenient. SM is way easier. Felwood is better. Burning steepes is better. Basically at every major place in the game, horde have a convenient FP and Ally are running, sometimes, from a different zone.
---
Sorry, I meant the current classic wow server you currently play on; that pre cata shit was just a general assumption that was correct not a discussion.
---
The most likely failure point for duo jump runs is the healer. You can have a fairly average geared warrior if you have a great healer, but a poorly geared healer will struggle badly. It also takes a LOT more experience for the healer to learn how to handle the fights.
---
The "weakest" duo I've done was on my Warrior (who is pre-bis, with zero raid gear) and with a half-raid geared Shaman, and it was a breeze. So your gear should not be the source of the problem. On the other hand it took me a good 10-15 runs before I was completely comfortable healing it on my Shaman, even with a bunch of raid gear.
---
Feels good to see this before a mod deletes it, the most interesting post i've seen all night
---
Streisand effect unfold!
---
Want me to play my tiny violin for you?
---
And neither of those are on Heartseeker as Horde, right  ?
---
Again, on a ganking is server "Horde or Alliance" is way less important than "Majority faction vs Minority faction".
---
Exactly the same failure cascade happens on every ganking server, and for the same essential reason - being on the regularly losing side isn't fun.
---
There's absolutely no evidence he stream sniped him though, and he's shown himself tracking him down and ganking him when he's not streaming with ease.
---
That's funny,  I actually did main a Troll Rogue in vanilla/tbc!
---
If you can show me a video of killing a good geared sl lock before they get their second sac off (requires you to do over 1k dps btw in the time frame youre describing) in this patch ill believe youre not lying.
---
What youre describing is simply not attainable unless the lock misplays in the current content.
---
Same way BGs seperate levels, in brackets of 10.
---
Pretty sure twinks in wow originated as 19s solely to dominate BGs. That’s what the majority of twinks are and what they do. They stay at 19, 29, etc. and play BGs. Maybe duel. 
---
I reckon you’re in the minority. Most twinks won’t go into the world so they don’t accidentally gain xp. Just cus you claim to do things differently than others doesn’t change anything.
---
Yes, we would easily be looking at 2-3 patches and at least hiring 20-30 more devs. Not counting the fleet of arithmeticians that would need to be flown in.
---
You probably just want Shadowlands.
---
&gt;Not sure what this has to do with anything, but I'm sure you'll make some more terrible assumptions then move the goalposts when you are proven wrong.
---
&gt;Sorry, I meant the current classic wow server you currently play on;
---
Welp, I'm out.
---
If you play on a ganking server, you do it because you like ganking.
---
And there are few things better if you're a ganker than a target who is unaware of you being deposited into your combat range.
---
u sure post favoring alliance a lot from the perspective of a horde player
---
u sure ur not roleplaying buddy
---
"small streamer"
---
You mean the place with basically zero loot that people run once for quests then never go back? Yeah that's totally the same thing.
---
I probably should have picked a more ambiguous title tbh
---
Maybe biased, but not in my experience.  Outside of raid night, allies seem to hold searing a lot of the time.  Burning seems to be about balanced, more horde with small group but fewer allies with big groups.
---
Instance portals are almost always ally in my experience trying to zone in with my alt.
---
But Who's on first!
---
No, I was ally on Skeram, being which is worst because its HIGH population compares to heartseeker. Again, no other server is relevant to heartseeker so great example. So I repeat, what server do you play on currently
---
I checked last night, no Sword of Zeal for sale so i cant give a price on that but id say itd be higher than krol  due to its rarity in the server and its slightly better overall dps isnt it?. 
---
No UBRS key, can i lockpick? Im 300. whats an avg Rend run time wise. Im still away for another week and my thrash blade just isnt cutting it anymore
---
Skip thunderclap. It has a threat bonus on it, but it doesn't anywhere near make up for the huge rage cost, lack of defensive stance bonus, and the battle stance penalty. Defensive stance gives you 130% threat generation, Battle stance gives you 80% threat generation. This prevents Thunderclap from generating meaningful threat, even with the built in bonus.
---
Charge -&gt; Demo -&gt; Defensive Stance -&gt; start sundering targets. Gets you going faster, avoids wasting 20 rage, and allows the mobs to hit you more for better rage generation. Reducing monster attack speed by 20% = reducing rage generation by 20%.
---
Perhaps a war/Druid tank and a resto/ele shaman?
---
Holy shit I forgot how doodoo paladin t3 was hahahaha
---
Leveling to 60 as horde there was 2-3 times where I ran out of quests and had to grind for a level or two. Not awful but I'd rather be questing. Problem is I've leveled enough characters between vanilla, private servers and classic that I year too efficiently :(
---
Happy cake day
---
You're right but it's absolutely a problem now and Blizzard knew it was coming. They made the server capacity like 10x what vanilla was.
---
Shrug, continue thinking what you want to, just don't run home crying the first time you run into a capable fury warrior.
---
I already told you how I kill locks before they can even land a spell.
---
good dmg?
---
i mean, you still do shit dmg on basically any class that isnt an enhance shaman with it
---
2h is underwhelming overall, ret dps is trash, and warriors arent that hot compared to casters in raid gear
---
Are you seriously afraid to post what realm you currently play on? This is classic wow subreddit incase you forgot beta friend
---
It was a problem, just smaller in magnitude. People also really sucked back then. Like really sucked. If you really wanted to escape a situation, you could if you were good enough, which today is 95% of the population.
---
People bitch and moan about not being able to level in peace - well why did you pick a pvp server and not hit 60 before the pvp phase? Vanilla was always about you-snooze-you-lose
---
If you want a more vanilla-like experience, you would have transferred off of your high-pop server the first day you could. Which for all the biggest servers was months ago
---
You can tank in this gear, hit would help with threat issues. Voones vice grips gloves, satyrs bow, rune of guard captain over black hands breadth, Brigam girdle. But you should head into MC ASAP no reason to wait
---
Imagine being this edgy
---
But then no one would kill them
---
With every passing week, it seems like the Krol blade is dropping in price. My server is down to 280g. I’d personally just farm the gold and advertise wanting to buy it for 280g every now and then.
---
You dont really gear too much differently to be honest, for a lot of pvp you want stam over spell power.  I'd just swap any shadow dmg pieces for generic spell power or stam.
---
Yeah I’ve seen those emissaries around town too which suggest to me we might see the holiday weekends but haven’t seen it confirmed.
---
because they killed the guards you numbnuts
---
&gt; Players will choose whats best for themselves
---
I chose to play alliance on an imbalanced server, probably wasn't the best idea but it makes pvp fun when you stomp a group of 8-10 horde with a group of 5 alliance.
---
Advertise was doing this before he even got paid for it. This will change nothing. And fuck twitch for bowing down to people like asmongold. He put himself in a position to be stream sniped by refusing to add a delay.
---
That wasn't my experience, on forums on the internet, as early as 2003.more realistically that opinion just comes from personal experience which doesn't make that the official meaning.
---
&gt; Also, I'd throw BShout in there. It's better than demo shout at generating threat.
---
This is not correct, battle shout is only better than sunder with 5 total targets, and on a single target. With multiple targets the threat is split across all targets, demo shout -&gt; start sundering is vastly superior.
---
https://youtu.be/nfaE7NQhMlc
---
Anecdotally, I've heard that Alliance zones were created first and the boats were supposed to be the main method of transport between the main cities which had port-areas. The idea was the Alliance would defend their areas and repel any potential horde invasions would encourage the faction combat. 
---
When it came to horde, because it wasn't as easy to make everything near a port, they added the Zeppelins and the guards were added to protect them since they weren't inside towns.
---
Not sure if it's accurate or what, but it would explain why the Menethil guards are like level 40~ while the Zeppelin guards are 50+ with knockback.
---
I was commenting on the stv pvp in zones comment. Guess why this got downvoted so much. The title wasn’t clear enough?
---
Ours has only one.  I wouldn't say the *average* has two, but I can see how it's going to be maybe more common early on than before.
---
Which as a warlock I'm okay with, having to wait on threat is zZz...
---
Nah, getting another pet which has minor difference towards broken tooth that is only really good vs casters is the only option.
---
While leveling, some hunters go melee to not use up ammunition for solo questing.
---
It's for sure not a good "stat-stick" for ranged dps, but if you're looking for melee dps for solo questing as beast master, it's pretty good.
---
Sure you want everyone to know that you fiddle with your game files bro?
---
And the bosses can have twice the number of debuffs
---
Lol. I'm sure all this crying is helping 🤣
---
Don't let the door hit ya!
---
it is. Because at the beginning Blizzard opened server after popularity. If more people would have rolled on PVE servers they would have opened more.
---
I’ll miss you Advertise. Get rank 14 and gank Asmon for us
---
See this comment is a perfect example of why "data" isn't always accurate, even when it's factually correct.
---
If 2000 of those alliance quests were for levels 1-10, your information would still be correct, but the point you're trying to refute (that alliance lack mid 40's quests) would not be backed up with your 'data'.
---
What levels and zones are the extra 200 alliance quests? Are they quests you'd expect players to do in addition to their other quests? And so on. Having "more quests" does not equate to a better leveling experience and using "sources" they way you have done so is an extremely poor way to make a point.
---
&gt;Are you seriously afraid to post what realm you currently play on?
---
Another terrible assumption.
---
I've posted it before and have had no issues sharing it. I just didn't want to talk to you anymore, but calling you out on another stupid assumption was too tempting.
---
I was talking about the exp for winning. I believe one of the other comments answered my questions. You receive double rep reward for a victory during the battleground weekend. However, I now remember that you only receive exp from the 3xtoken turn in. Which as it is a quest, I don’t imagine changes given the double reward weekend or not.
---
It's absolutely doable. I duo it with a priest, arms spec with plate gear and Demonshear.
---
Alliance do the exact same shit as horde
---
Yeah my thoughts exactly, the gold isnt to much of an issue anymore because i can knock out 3-4 pick pocket runs nightly while at work. I just cant commit to a long dungeon run as my time while away is very scheduled
---
I'd say you're a dummy for such a confusing comment.
---
So much this. You don't get to be a public figure and then demand special treatment when people interact with you in a way you don't like on a pvp server.
---
I find Alliance gets more...civilized people. 
---
Just compare the fantasy of Horde vs Alliance and you'll see.
---
I tried to stealth onto the Zeppelin from Under City to Org as Alliance just to cut time off instead of trying to fly from a 10+ horde camped WPL FP, the guards can see a mile away.
---
no, it doesnt explain it
---
as you can see, camping alliance towns and cities is exponentially easier
---
it was done to favor horde faction
---
if the goal was fairness, both methods of transport would have the same lvl of protection
---
So you're afraid to state you play on a PvE server, I think I'll see my way out now that I decimated you on reddit. Be thankful it's not in the game.
---
I'm pretty sure he did nothing more than chase him in a game, nothing to do with any harassment for a grown man.
---
Now take a moment to realize what a shitshow would be a tbc server with the same population size of classic servers .
---
What? Just run dungeons. You're silly.
---
Which server out of interest?
---
At least wait a couple levels and get the polearm from uldaman. Good melee weapon and stat stick.
---
Geez... reroll pve my man.
---
Cheers
---
were you 60? i haven't done it in classic but in vanilla i used to use the zeppelin stealthed
---
Is there we ask what Asmon's dick tastes like?
---
&gt;Time to shine my beta book worm, point out how I'm wrong and in what regard.
---
Simply refer to any of your previous posts.
---
&gt;Keep changing the subject though on how you're afraid to state what server you play on. Its cute
---
I've posted it several times. But keep being wrong, it's cute.
---
&gt; Bottom panel are people who have been on the very worst severs since day one who refuse to reroll or take free transfers.
---
That just accentuates the issues for everyone else.
---
&gt; I'm not trying to PVP
---
You um. You know there are PVE servers right?
---
It really takes a special kind of moron to play ret in vanilla.
---
So now you're admitting defeat by repeating the same thing? I expected so much more from you, sad.
---
20% reduction from MD isn't terrible at least, costs a decent chunk of damage, so really its even more!
---
the special proc ability is way more useful later on than Whirlwind
---
\^
---
catch em on the rez
---
&gt;**deliberately contrary to what one expects**
---
Not true on horde.
---
Who cares? He's an honorless target
---
Let him die, repeat until he gets in line or kick and replace
---
If it's profitable for me, it's not being an asshole. Don't forget it's enemy factions.
---
Why? If you're struggling to maintain rage generation, you are directly working against yourself by using Thunderclap. You are spending 20 rage to reduce your rage generation by 20%.
---
I leveled 2 horde toons back in Vanilla, and then when BC came out I rolled Ally. Duskwood was my absolute favorite zone, made so much better by the rep grinds that came with BC
---
As a Horde i can safely say this is true
---
As I said, from my experience. Buster
---
10-year-olds
---
Wow... way to cement the role of you guys being dicks with such a shitty response!
---
Bringing up 'past' guild, alleged, transgressions that are completely unrelated to this specific situation shows you fail big time as a GM. You should've scolded your boy and taken it on the chin and apologised
---
Bo Burnham: a song from the perspective of God "You shouldn't abstain from rape just because you think that I want you to. You shouldn't rape because rape is a fucked up thing to do."
---
The guards for both factions are annoying and do the same thing, who the fuck cares.
---
Projecting much?
---
Wtf so unfair unban him.
---
Telling everyone how to do it, and making work in practice would take longer then finding a healer.
---
Funny, I expected nothing from you and I wasn't disappointed.
---
I see, I looked over it when I was going through SM and just told myself that it wasn’t much of an upgrade at all, if not worse so once I got the helm on the first run I was done with armory.
---
Wow that pathing for the second boss... how did I not know that? I can skip that water ele now. Thanks for this.
---
I have a new hero! Keep on killing him!
---
This happened to our main tank early in classic, only person really FR geared at the time.  They contacted live chat support and got it fixed.
---
Then it’s not giving it to whoever wins by luck, but rather who was the fastest. If that was how it worked, it would be mandatory for everyone to have a macro. I’ve never heard of this and I hope a Raid leader never pulls that.
---
I'm rooting for the gankers at this point
---
25 for gathering profs iirc.
---
&gt;fair 1v1 
---
literally has never happened in the history of WoW
---
Yes that definitely happens to Horde in the high 20-40 range. You can definitely alleviate it with some good questing habits like just killing efficiently between quest areas pre-mount some or doing a dungeon here or there but it is a very real thing to run into on Horde.
---
Are you done yet? You've said so much and look how far you've come to contributing to the subject, keep it up!
---
What’s the cc the horde guards have? I played alliance back in the day on my priest and remember occasional nets that rooted you?
---
They definitely didn’t do it cause of faction balance. Horde had a very healthy population on most vanilla servers.
---
I'm definitely jealous of that 83 dps.
---
More like PvPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
---
And when Asmongold starts a raid to camp Advertise and asks people where is Advertise and people pass on info from his stream then does Asmon get banned too?
---
I don't acknowledge any problem with the game.
---
Jesus, what a pathetic post. If you get this angry about getting ganked, drop the damn game for a couple of weeks.
---
Cool music.
---
Level 2 probably walked there, summoned ones are usually lvl 1. It's usually not *that* bad, if you use spirit rez to your advantage.
---
The guy formed a community with a focus on hating another partnered streamer. The guy didn't mod his chat and it was literally filled with people shitting on Asmon which is something he almost encouraged. The guy is obsessed with Asmon to a point it's a little disturbing.  
---
If anyone did what Advertise did they would be getting banned, what Advertised did was funny at first when it was done in the game and it was only camping. The drama went much further than that and what looked like 2 streamings butting heads for content turned into malicious harassment. This goes much farther then simple stream sniping if it was just simple stream sniping then...who cares right? 1 day of camping Asmon and giving the guy a bad day woulda been A-OK and honestly Asmon would deserve that after talking shit about the horde, yea good one advertise.  
---
Literal months of this though, the guy made a stream and cumulated a community dedicated with hatred, the guy formed a raid and made a DKP system except instead of points earned through raids, it was points earned through camping a streamer. The guy hosted a youtube channel filled with videos "exposing" this same streamer every single day as well as shitting on the guy constantly and encouraging his community to go after him as well. I mean come on guys I get you all dislike Asmon and enjoy seeing him be put through this bullshit, but let's not be delusional here I want to believe you all aren't as stupid as this makes you look.  
---
What Advertise is doing is against twitch ToS. forming and farming hate and using it to grow his platform which would build a safe space of people who probably get off at seeing Asmongold going through the bullshit which didn't just affect his game, but affected the quality of his stream.  
---
tl;dr If you really think this wasn't against ToS you are delusional. Advertise was banned for breaking it, anyone doing what he did would be banned for this.
---
Do you play? Do you watch the NBA? Do you have any products made in China? By your definition if you say yes to anything above then you are doing the people of HK no service of your own.
---
Imagine being so obtuse that obvious sarcasm eludes you.
---
go orc because pvp trinket breaks fear
---
Rolled a PvE server yet? Or still complaining about PvP on PvP servers?
---
Free will is always the bane of those who avoid accepting any amount of responsibility.
---
Why does everyone think this game needs to be 100% even 100% fair 100% of the time? 
---
Read the lore of the game you are playing and the bigger picture of the whole thing rather than tunnel vision focusing on (Run___Get____Press____ and repeat) 
---
One side is stronger. 
---
Even the fantasy concept of a mystical war between humans and orcs there is going to be IMBALANCE. 
---
Its a game about a **literal war** between two different civilizations plus the entirety of the game is focused on fraction vs faction pvp and taking raid point and bosses for better gear. 
---
Like imagine playing NBA2k or something similar and demanding that the game needs to be focused around only playing **All star west vs east**.
---
He won't for the next 3-4 times he'll die there.
---
Sounds like a change to me.  What you don't seem to understand is that r14 is heavily correlated with skill, you can't go winning only 75% of your premades and hit rank 14.  It's just a combination of skill and an absurd amount of time.
---
All that for no honor too since you had the honorless target buff.
---
Make a stealth macro that equips the dagger, and SS equips swords and or slice and dice equipping swords
---
good
---
I just rolled a warrior, any source material I can read?
---
You seriously think they're going to catch everyone account sharing?  No they won't.
---
the idea was "what constitutes harassment and what doesn't "   
---
so its ok for a player to kos any other player vs a player trying to kill another particular player? in that case people should be ok with every horde camping fp because is not targeted, i know its against the tos of twitch but that doesn't make it right imo, if youre streaming you should already know that some players might snipe you, is just what it is.  
---
You also mentioned youtube, not only twitch, so i guess were talking about harassing in different plataforms so blogs and websites should be noted too.
---
dude fuck off lol. literally go and play retail, it was made for ppl like you.
---
Yeah it's a small change, just as they nerfed the Spy addon.
---
Play a newer game with modern systems if you don't like old games with antiquated systems.
---
Never want to thunderclapif you have threat issues, less rage generated and therefore less threat generated.
---
assmongoloid should be camped
---
You think a gaming company that revolves around money is going to limit the amount of time a customer can play? It’s a nice thought at least.
---
It's an okay weapon if you dont want to farm dal rends.
---
If you actually believe in something like limiting time played you're either a troll or.. yeah.
---
Either way, neither deserves an actual response.
---
Mate if you were any good you wouldn’t make that comment. Payo is one of the best rogues in classic, but it doesn’t matter. If a hemo pvp rogue opens another rogue and he has blind and cold blood, its an auto win no matter how good the other rogue is - unless the first rogue goofs up or a stun gets resisted or something. 
---
So the guy waits for his follows him sapping Payo to annoy him, then jumps him when he has his cds. And that continues every hour, every day, for months. Its kind of ridiculous how committed this nerd is.
---
I am simply asking for proof here. You shouldn't just throw accusations around without proof.
---
So you don't have an argument beyond insulting people, gotcha.  Just as I suspected.
---
What makes you think I'm upset at all? Wow, I can't believe you! All of these assumptions all of a sudden? When did you become so wrong and assume I'd PM them on this account? Are you okay? Please take a deep breath, we can get through this together friend
---
it doesn't need to be 100% perfectly balanced but my problem with the faction imbalance is that it's not fun. it's not fun to be the majority faction, there's not enough people to fight and no sense of danger. and it's even less fun to be the minority obviously.

It's still accurate.
---
Dagger rogue is your answer
---
How long does your actual run take?
---
Also you don't need to actually jump on the ledge for Zevrim, simply hugging it is enough. Maybe if he gets too close it won't work though, I never let him past the pillar because I need to LOS the sacrifices (priest).
---
I'm not the above poster, calm your shit.
---
That being said, this thread is a meme.
---
The first kill is just to get them to respawn at a guaranteed location without the honorless buff.
---
Took the words right out of my mind. 
---
If OP literally can’t even have the self awareness to see the own fallacy in his thinking I doubt he will be intelligent enough to grasp why his idea is bad.
---
100%
---
On the imbalanced servers, it takes  30 to 40 minutes to corpse run to brd. Add in the time it takes to create the group and the chance of people dropping out during the corpse run and it's just not worth trying after a while.
---
Its bis for feral druids too.... talisman of evasion on the other hand is bis for feral druids and feral druids alone. 
---
Its not like HOJ doesnt drop pretty often and is extremely easy to get to. Shit i even have it on my priest.
---
Rogues are Best ?
---
As a priest I can run past almost anything in there and do one quick pull to finish the first floor. 
---
Not to mention the rest of he dungeon in like three or 4 pulls. Do rogues have an aoe I don’t know about?
---
Should be fine to move on to dire maul, start grinding there for a bit!
---
no ur are
---
I'm not sticking up for Advertise here but I've seen clips where people straight whisper Asmons location to him or others in his circle.
---
Menethil Sentries are lvl 40. Even if they were tk aggro on 60s ganking there, they wouldn't sot anything.
---
great counter point
---
This is definitely an issue, classic PvP is absolutely not about anything else than how much free time you have, but this isn’t a realistic solution. Rather removing the honor decay and increasing the required honor, so people can afford to do breaks and have a bit real life.
---
“Remember to take all things in moderation (even World of Warcraft)” and giving us the this PvP system is one of the best jokes Blizzard did.
---
Argument: It's a competitive video game, and if you can't beat the people playing a lot for it, you don't deserve some of the best items in the game.
---
Ended up going gnome mage. Cause I figured I can stil burst and also cc and take on more than one
---
Most important thing is just doing all the dungeons once. Each dungeon is about a level with its quests.
---
That ensured I always had quests to do.
---
I get a big dick when my group outnumbers 2:1
---
I get a big dick when I'm outnumbered 2:1
---
Different strokes, I guess
---
If it reduces a targets armour from 2.1k to 0 then it's a 35.7% dmg boost, but it varies on remaining armour/overcapped pen, or stack number.
---
Do you think they're going to catch me riding two accounts to bypass the limitation you suggested?
---
I'll get my 16h WoW fix and there's nothing you can do about it!
---
What’s an affordable &lt;500g dw warrior setup? 
---
When I hit 52 (currently 51) I will have Bloodrazor in main hand and assassination blade in off hand. (Booth with fiery weapon enchant on it)
---
I think it’s pretty strong for now. I have managed to dw tank a coupe of dungeons. Also 1v1ed a level 53 warrior he was 2h axe. 
---
But I have been told I have to be well geared as a dw fury warrior to be useful. And I can definitely tell I’m still weak against other classes in 1v1 fights.
---
I'm a 2h fury. You'll have to work harder to keep up with the dual wielders but it's definitely not a meme. I'm usually middle of the fury warriors no problem.
---
Why? Why is it good? Do you hate streamers? 
---
Why do you hate them? 
---
They dont impact you unless you make it your business to be impacted by them.
---
Is this a troll? I can’t tell sometimes.
---
I doubt you can get R14 on 16h anyway.
---
K. Why?
---
Doing God's work.
---
We know, we've had 14 years to learn this system.
---
What makes you think this has anything to do with PvP participation?
---
Guards are the biggest difference, it's actually such an insanely bad design decision that it just has to be on purpose
---
For me the only interesting part of Classic is leveling, experiencing the world and doing non-max level dungeons. After the first time I literally couldn't care less about MC or Ony's lair.
---
Competition should be mainly about skill, not grinding the most hours played time.  Limiting everyone to the same playtime therefore makes efficiency and skill of upmost importance.
---
A couple of days late, but thank you. I decided to stick with the lock.
---
I HAVE KILLED ANGERFORGE 230 TIMES AND STILL DONT HAVE IT
---
I agree for the most part I just think if they want to ban people over naughty words they should have it specifically stated in the rule set. Does not feel okay otherwise
---
I have an even better solution - let players just queue into a dungeon from any location! And make a system that would find you required roles automatically because why not! Oh wait a minute I’ve definitely seen this and it’s called garbage retail.
---
That is exactly what I was chasing out of WPVP. I see classic more like an event that I don't expect to mean much longer term so I'm playing casually,  but that means I can't really play at all.
---
Blizzard did realize that the ranking system had its flaws, and they deviated from it as time went on. They aren’t going to make any changes to it because they are determined to keep classic as authentic as possible to vanilla.
---
That drastic of a change is unpalatable to most people, which is why I am suggesting this idea as a compromise solution.
---
Lol change parts of the game to try and fix the fucked WPVP 
---
Still leaves the 80% of the game unplayable and dominated by one side..
---
Pretty cool idea, but only to cover up this huge mess, witch won’t fix the problem.
---
No that's Flynn.
---
Where as elemental works all of the time.
---
Access reddit via a PC, on the right side of the screen tick the box that says something about a flair and you can pick your icons.
---
Nope.
---
holy shit. how many hordes were there?
---
Why do I have to know this? Imagine if everyone starts keep us updated on their progression it’s not facebook come on bro
---
You guys realize the next thing in that sequence is Pvt Pile blowing his own brains out after killing the Gunny. Does that mean the hunter kills the warrior?
---
Christ horde players get so  baited by a simple meme
---
True
---
is there any horde that was streaming inside that?
---
Yes
---
he literally has a video explaining how he is cautious about how he finds asmon or esfand because theyre both crybabies who threaten to report him for stream sniping despite him not doing it you troglodyte
---
Zinger!
---
Not every single player in classic knows what Twitch and streamers are. There would be plenty of people on that server who are completely innocent victims.
---
Because getting FP camped or killed by the opposing faction is PVP.
---
Sorry I like to go quest and kill mobs while you stay in IF for hours selling shit/ looking for enchants. 
---
Just literally classified everyone who leveled fast. Wow your smart.
---
Surely walking all the way to Silithus would give more than a single level though?
---
This is about he level of intelligence I expect from someone who enjoys asmons stream.
---
They should also give epic mounts to those who dont have the time to farm gold because they only get 4 hrs a week to play.
---
Also a piece of raid tier a week because its not fair that those who spend the time farming prebis and doing attunements will get it eventually anyway sincr they play all day.
---
[You need to solve riddle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7ZrKehQ_xc&amp;t=1243s)
---
I'm not saying those bis twink items that are worth hundreds of gold, just single digit gold stuff that is better than what you usually would find in that level unless very lucky.
---
This is also my experience as well. An alliance will basically never attempt to 1v1 unless they have an obvious win.
---
This in turn makes me out right aggressive towards Alliance players. 
---
All anecdotal but most of my guild attests to the same
---
This is the kind of player tormenting that drives me to PvP
---
actually yes, speaking ill of twitch users as a streamer is against twitch ToS
---
The risk for a lot of people transferring off was that the pop would be so low that forming raids for BWL would be significantly harder with a much higher risk of a dead server.
---
My warrior is called Cannonfodder but i'm dps af.
---
They never know what leatherwearing warrior crit them to the outland 🏥
---
Check for sword of zeal, skip krol. I got lucky and snatched one up for 100g (think it's only one on server). There's times where I literally have a minute of straight procs from it
---
the issue is lockout, it can happen where IIRC once you zone in you get a lockout and if your guild is on separate lockouts not doing this.... can be an issue.
---
both are against ToS
---
He can trinket out.
---
I don't play or watch the NBA but my point stands that you previously bashed people who played then started playing again cause you didn't want to miss out. Don't drag me down to your level.
---
You never see me playing but tell me I'm bad. You must be special lol
---
As an original wow player and the person who reverse engineered their ranking formula (fyi I reached rank 10 before I stopped), it was indeed abusive and imo eventually was changed to a currency system.
---
I personally don't see the allure of the classic systems remembering all the problems and pains that came with it, this was one of the most jarring memories, the grinding for PvP rankings.
---
Found him!
---
You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.
---
Cheers mate! :D
---
Why are you going to Astranaar?
---
Except that poster isn’t the one who openly declared they would boycott those things. Stop trying to deflect because you can’t handle people calling you out on your own lack of resolve.
---
Get it. You won't regret it.
---
Its not that i dont want to farm it, i just dont have the ability to for 2 weeks every month and if it doesnt drop my coming off swing, im stuck fsrming gold with thrash blade for another 2 weeks
---
Not sure, walk to blasted lands only put me to level 2. It's somewhat shorter, but you tend to skip a lot of exploration if you follow the roads either way.
---
It is good for hemo but not good for raiding since the sinister strike speed is normalized. Vis'kag or brut would likely do better in main hand
---
I only play prot, so can't help much build wise, but just wanted to point out that warriors are very weak in 1v1 scenarios, so don't judge yourself too harshly based on that.  Group pvp is where you will shine.
---
They warned everyone. I don't even know who the guy is but that Blizzard bro said clearly "You don't want Classic."
---
&gt; You never see me playing but tell me I'm bad. You must be special lol
---
Your words expose you big time champ. You're obviously clueless.
---
I'm a fan of advetiose baby, what do you mean? I'm ready to catch the next stream on facebook gaming
---
no, it's bronze.
---
username
---
Technically correct. But you'd be surprised how many of them die without unmounting. If you notice all of that is happens within 2.5-3 seconds from out of stealth.
---
No lockouts until a boss is downed.
---
what
---
&gt; I have never run it more than once for quests on each character.
---
Look at mister gets-enough-bandanas-in-one-run over here
---
I’m a priest and I get wrecked by undead rogues. Stun locked to near death and then I can’t even fear to get them off me for a second to heal due to OP WoTF
---
So I changed my mind on something, so what? What does that have to do with the thread? Why are we having a discussion about me?
---
have you tried killing him more times than that?
---
Congratulations, glad it is working well for you buddy. However it seems that the other thousands of people don't seem to be sharing your experience bud.
---
Quote exactly what I said it's wrong.
---
Are these mutually exclusive?  I follow this sub and haven't had a retail sub since WOTLK!
---
Oh damn you got me. I probably have run it twice for that reason before, but on my most recent character that level I actually said fuck that and abandoned that one.
---
Gotta get that agi enchant on your mages gloves for the dodge
---
Wait, I thought the entire point of classic was a close-knit community? Are you saying the community wouldnt let them know and give them the option to transfer? 
---
Sounds like a shitty community to me.
---
where did he cheat?
---
Sure it is.  I said it was and that makes it valid.  Oh, you thought because you're the OP that you get to decide what's valid for everyone? HAHAH 
---
Your argument is that you don't have enough time to get Rank 14.  Well, MMOs are all about time investment; so like I said, maybe MMOs aren't your thing.
---
A ticket would do nothing here, Blizzard would not interfere over one action... But their faction can, because no matter how bad of a day you've had you cannot excuse what was done in the above video.  Bad day at work/school so you camp a few people of the opposing faction for a while?  Sure...  Kill the rare spawn someone of your own faction is trying to get, as they BEG and PLEAD for you to stop?
---
Fuck that.  Let 'em be known for their actions.
---
Lol when bgs drop those items will fall in value as well since the market will be flooded with them. I don't think the prices will rise as much as people think. Shadowfang is already pricey
---
this was a problem neat end of vanilla
---
People are pushing more honor in world pvp than you're likely to get in battlegrounds, so it's not really irrelevant.  And you can choose to remain ignorant if you like.  There is massive competition for rank gear, and it sounds like you are unable to compete for it.  You can't get em all.
---
At the very least, if your alt is a warrior/rogue/paladin/shaman, you should be buying blue weapons off the AH every 6-8 levels, if you haven't gotten one from a dungeon or something. There are plenty of cheap ones.
---
Blue armor, ehh, if you feel like spending the extra gold, but a blue weapon will have a massive impact on your leveling.
---
If you are a human I would do either one of the following :  
---
Buy Krol Blade  
---
Farm Dal'rends
---
They are BiS for humans and definitely worth it. I would try to get a slight deal on it possibly, I just recently got mine for 260gold which is about 80 gold cheaper than my server average on Incendius. You can try whispering the people with it up for auction and offer to buy it for them for a slight discount, because of listing fees and how long some people sit on these expensive items you will probably find someone willing to give a discount.
---
Nice comment + flair combo. 10/10
---
In BIS armor with consumables and raid buffs, the large majority of the weapon's actual DPS (shown on your character sheet) comes from attack power. After you've checked a few boxes - get +5 weapon skill, get 6% hit, get Hand of Justice, and use a slow mainhand - attack power and crit chance by far are the two most important stats for overall dps.
---
Thrash blade is sexy for the same reason as HOJ, which has only 20 ap - getting another chance for an extra attack scales up the value of all the other attack power you already have - and you already have a lot of it. The extra swing benefits from that other attack power and also generates rage, which is spent on abilities that benefit from your attack power. The better your gear, the more the weapon DPS increase would have to be to consider upgrading from Thrash Blade to another sword.
---
A lot of people don't properly evaluate the dps that can be done with a Thrash Blade; they're incorrect.
---
Awe I zoomed all the way in and started there :(
---
Are you going to make more?
---
Ranged guards now knockback when they shoot. It's to prevent people from griefing up on rooves up in places like Gadgetzan arena.
---
This gnome had multiple guards shooting him so he got knocked back all the way to the other building. Pretty hilarious too see!
---
Proof of streamsniping? Players gave his location. That isn't stream sniping, You have to actually snipe the stream to do that.
---
&gt; pre launch it was an instant downvote if you tried to explain something based on your pserver experience.
---
as it should have been. It's been demonstrated time and time again that Pservers got shit wrong all the fucking time and the experience on a pserver doesn't mean shit.
---
It wasn’t though. It was only major areas, not everywhere. You could go fuck off the BFE Azshara, Feralas or Winterspring and it was pretty much the same as always. Yeah, Burning Steppes, WPL, and Southshore has a 20 man raid and groups running around. But that would be quaint compared to this.
---
Mages and dps warriors took their place, hardly any hunters around to stigmatize any more.
---
No stream sniping if people tell you his location.
---
Yes, originally it was meant to be an equippable item, but they didn't want players using it as equipment instead of completing the quest, so they turned the bindings into regular quest items.
---
That's...crazy.
---
Where, when? People told him where asmongold is. That isn't stream sniping, that's information.
---
Throw Undead into the wind too: only fair.
---
Why is that? I thought the sword skill wasn't as good for PvP as PvE
---
Thanks! I'll do that, real curious about how it looks like.
---
How come Alliance are always talking about the Horde? We Horde literally just do not talk about the other faction at all.
---
How do people here deal with the mage bubbles? I have a cocky mage friend who is an absolute cunt and want to know how I can get the bubble off him as he always pops it before the duel starts
---
There's so many amazing Goon stories across every game they play. They're huge assholes but the shit they get up to is so funny.
---
Eluding is BIS I think?
---
It's hilarious that my friends convinced me, someone who swore off PvP servers back in Wrath, to come to Skeram|Alliance with them for Classic. I took the fast transfer off to Heartseeker after all the "PvP happened on a PvP server!" responses to my complaints and calls to aid
---
Now in phase 2 they're the ones complaining, and yeah they're lookin like that last Pooh right now
---
Everyday for a month? Lol
---
Agreed!
---
Not really solely focused on that; you still have to choose it from various other options
---
Here are my usual ways to level weapon skills to max and what I have done:  
---
1.) Kill the rats in the Ironforge tram, they spawn in the exact location about 1 second after the previous ones death, so you just keep hitting away.
---
2.) Going to a low level instance and just clearing it a couple of times.
---
I only got into WOW with classic (loved every second of it up until Phase 2, now I login about few times a week). Everybody is obviously aware of the issues with Phase 2 and there has been a number of suggestions to fix it (in terms of adding Battelgrounds,no idea what that is, and trying to balance out the factions etc).
---
My question is, why is [Warmode](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20763436154#post-2) for retail so despised? I mean on paper is sounds pretty reasonable but what were the real world end-results from it's implementation?
---
Before anybody crucifies me, yes I'm a casual and no I'm not calling for it to be implemented here, I'm just curious and after a history lesson.
---
This was a reasonable and unbiased post. Yes I play alliance, how could you tell?
---
If only you had a bubble...
---
While his solution may not be the best, the idea of changing the rank 14 grind to be a little healthier is not a bad one.
---
As someone who has done it before in the past it is not really something anyone should have to go through.
---
I’ve only watched this advertise/asmon thing unfold via YouTube clips but this is a PvP server right? Isn’t this just part of the game?
---
As someone with a 50 human war, 46 human rogue and 60 orc lock. It's just assholes on both sides evenly. Players will always want to take the easy pvp fight, when you outnumber people like the horde does that happens a lot more frequently for them.
---
I'm pretty sure the one rogue has Thunderfury. Which means this is not classic wow. Probably an old clip from a private server or the original game. Either way, camping the flight masters has always been a thing... It's just exacerbated with high population servers that are very bored... And frequently unbalanced.
---
It was originally designed this way, as an equippable item, but Blizz didn't want people using it as equipment instead of completing the quest, so they removed it and altered the Thunderfury questline so that you only need the binding items, and not the talisman of binding shard.
---
Tailoring is cheap and fast to get 300, just drop tailoring, get another prof, then pick up tailoring again for Bloodvine set
---
Big masses of disorganized players; not another pvp raid
---
Most gaming mice have software to create macros.  You could make a toggle macro set to a side button that simulates left+right mouse held down.  So 1 button press to toggle it on and a second press to toggle it off.
---
You mean they would if they could, sure. But on a 35/65 server you don't really get the option.
---
I've hated almost all priests that I've had heal me in dungeons so far. They usually rely too heavily on power ward shield and I don't know how many times I've died while they wand things with full mana. 
---
Hopefully some I come across some good priests to break this cycle.
---
Fuck it, it's Friday. Have my updoot.
---
Eh that's not how software dev works even if conceptually simple
---
You can rez at other spirit healers. When lhc is too camped I've rezzed at the gy south of service gate.
---
Horde would rage so hard.
---
there are thousands of people watching him daily, thousands of people who play, hundreds with two accounts. All he needs is one person to PM him.
---
lmao it got removed
---
At 1st I thought this post was about me. This was ours last night aswell.   https://imgur.com/n1M2e92
---
Me and my priest duo do it. I don't wear any leather, have full pre bis and a few raid pieces as well. My priest duo has half pre bis/half bis. So it is doable. 
---
Watch guides on it, learn what they are doing. You have to both bring explosives for the adds on the last boss. The healer has to learn how to LOS properly the mana burn. There are many things you have to make sure you do properly, or it will be a wipe. 
---
Also since they are 59, I would say they need more gear. Get to 60, farm some pre bis and try again. If one of you has enchanting and wants to know a gold farm you can do together RIGHT NOW for about 35g/hour EACH, so 70h/hour total, private message me. It's in instance and only requires enchanting.
---
Ideally servers would be faction balanced, but ignoring that, most would choose to take any advantage against an enemy.
---
TRUE LULW
---
^^^ plays horde
---
C’mon dude... “biggest B word imaginable?” 
---
You’re either trolling or begging To be trolled.
---
Few languages indeed use natrium for sodium and kalium for potassium.
---
Fuck gnomea
---
Took me about 30 seconds. Good job though. :)
---
Vanilla wasn't like this. Sides were more even, maybe even slightly Ally favored, and people didn't roam around trying to gank in death squads 20 hours a day.
---
PvP on PvP server bruh.
---
Dude the guys whole channel was just trashing this one person, why are you defending someone like that?
---
I have ran 2H fury and it is about the same DPS as 1h fury with Krol blade/Mirah's Song BUT this is with Bonereaver's edge which I would say is BiS 2h for humans. Hand of rag wont be as good as BE, and also if you aren't a human it wont be as good for the 305 weapon skill. 
---
But still, MC is easy, so do what you enjoy.
---
Prove that he was stream sniping
---
Just an unbelievable marvel. The sound effects and their placement and usage is on a level I can’t even fully appreciate.
---
This man is an absolute legend.

Pretty sure they're still only able to drop off a few select mobs.
---
Well i'm Twitch Partener, so i can tell you StreamSniping can be juge in different way, especially if hate speech or harassing / abusive negative attitude / langage are use
---
but i can't say to you if its legit, as the clip is not available, also i'm no more than partner, i can't access or ask for that information.
---
Without a healer, he shouldn't have been able to do that unless he's massively overgeared on you.
---
They're just too vulnerable to CC.
---
That's pretty funny, I'll work on that next.
---
Omg U did actually put him in rofl
---
Besides the point, the guys whole twitch existence is to trash asmongold. Just.. why, he’s leeching off his success for views and money can’t you see that?
---
A good rogue wont let the SL warlock play the game. People who think SL beats rogues haven't ever fought a rogue with 2 brain cells.
---
Can you summon someone level 2 ? seems legits, that make it way easyer
---
Imagine being able to have fun even if everything isn't compartmentalised into a box.
---
It was a valid strategy, especially against oddjobs.
---
This has nothing to do with me getting R14, it's about what is reasonable, healthy, and moral.  Truth is I do not have 12 hours a day to commit to this game, nor would I wish to do that again (yes I am a former Grand Marshal BTW, so I understand this on a level you likely never will).  I have no wish to put myself through that again.  And I don't want others to have to do the same thing I did.  MMOs are not just about time investment.  As someone else said, pvp is about competition, and the heart of competition is a skill check.  If a system doesn't embrace that, then in essence it is anti-competitive and therefore not real pvp.
---
This fuckin guy, I’ll tell ya h’what
---
You really are oblivious to sarcasm lmao
---
Prolly, I would assume it would work in a similar way the spy addon works
---
The problem there is that yes, they can drop their own aggro, but they can't drop the aggro of the healer who has been building threat during this time.
---
If I'm given *any* time to build threat it shouldn't be an issue, it's when it happens early that's when things get messy.
---
My PvP server felt fine until the moment killing other players became worth something, then it became a worldwide death trap for both factions. You can't really play the game in today's modern PvP server at the moment, it's much different than what I experienced in 2004.
---
That's an excellent point.  And the proliferation of discord has made it very easy to game the system cross-faction.
---
This is the only account I've used for 7 years now.  So even if JayOSU is an alt account of RussLynch46, let the words come from me instead: Holy shit dude, go get yourself a beer.  You obviously need it.
---
Need a troll/Orc version of waldo and more of this xD
---
it's literally everything, I can try though big guy.
---
&gt;killed him a few times
---
wrong, whole channel based around doing it.
---
&gt;why should advertise have empathy towards that
---
that isn't the conversation
---
&gt;Why is it advertise responsibility to control his viewers going to other streams
---
this part doesn't matter. When the entirety of your reputation is killing asmon, and then that leaks outside of the containment twitch channel, it spreads issues. Doesn't make it his fault, just reality
---
&gt; there's like 5 or 10 youtube channels that clip asmon DAILY that make money off it
---
these people aren't harassing asmongold and getting in the way of his entertainment. 
---
&gt; he fucked up and followed his buddies to a pvp server knowing he wasnt going to measure up to the sweaty nerds that play classic the meta way and is getting ripped apart by any coordinated group.
---
him complaining about this has nothing to do with advertise specifically. It isn't about matching up to classic meta nerds either, it's about being outnumbered by them at virtually all times, making it boring and frustrating to participate
---
&gt;Asmon talked a bunch of shit before pvp got incentivized then got shit on
---
see answer above
---
&gt;That's why hes mad, poor baby isnt getting free rank 14 like he can get free pve gear
---
he never said he was going for r14 as far as I'm aware.
---
&gt;I cant believe anyone can defend asmon on this one
---
that's because you're dumb
---
&gt;Biggest leech on twitch
---
biggest consistent viewer on the platform is a leech, see answer above
---
&gt;watches other people's youtube videos taking views away while getting his alts leveled up by guildies while having the audacity to bitch at his guild mates that they arent 60 yet or full bis yet
---
so? Leave it to the people that make videos to complain about it if they're so buttwrenched about losing views. it's not his problem, nor is it against the twitch tos. And, if youre not 60 by now, you're not playing the game with any kind of seriousness and can never be counted on to perform in any meaningful way. Why not bitch at useless players?
---
&gt;Does gake anytime to be a good gm and help anyone other than his close group
---
you're going to hate hearing this, but his time is more valuable than that.
---
&gt;But hey it's a video game who cares anyways LOL classic ain't gonna be around forever anyways.
---
I stand corrected, this is the one part of your entire post that is correct.
---
Aye, Menethil being contested always bothered me. They did end up fixing it with the stormwind harbor in WoTLK.
---
Gnomeregan is probably the worse dungeon in the game. it's utter trash.
---
Do your research before you comment on stuff like this. There is a load of evidence behind all of this and he deserved every bit of his ban.
---
I got R14 as well, this isn't about me wanting to do it again, it's about not wanting others to go through the same anguish.  This is not a moral system!
---
"It's fun for me!" - The guy with 100 faction members helping him take out the level 54 guy trying to complete a single quest for hours.
---
R14 was never about skill.
---
It's not.  You knew what the product was before you bought it.  Makes it difficult to take your point seriously.  You also had server census player counts and didn't see the red flags for your server.  That's user error, go down with your ship captain.
---
I hope so
---
I would heavily reconsider rolling on a PvE server man. You are on a server with extreme que times and once you’re out of your 20s you’ll be a walking target!
---
Given battlegrounds aren't out yet, I believe you are making assumptions that are probably invalid.  Provide proof?
---
Not everything has to be BiS.
---
What a dick head
---
There are a lot of things about retail that are a huge improvement. Warmode, the looking for group system, the talent system, loot distribution, and more. Classic is great also. I find myself playing them about 50/50. If you haven't tried Battle for Azeroth, it's on sale right now. It's worth a shot. You may find you like it better.
---
Nah the insult is that I'm geared out and you're not when this was the version you fanboi'd for.
---
Probably when you play for 16 hours a day that 200 hours is only 12 days of playing.
---
Lmao now I’ve seen it all.  Horde were and AFTERTHOUGHT that were rushed into the game at the tail end of development(The WoW Diary: A Journal of Computer Game Development).  Not only that, but are we seriously forgetting the disgusting history of AV and alliance favoring?  Lawl
---
Money changes things.
---
Beforehand, he was choosing between gank asmon for free or gank someone else for free.
---
Now, its gank asmon for free or gank someone else and get paid.
---
Thats extremely shitty. I watched As and Esfand lie about him over and over, and it looks like they got their way. Sad.
---
He said ideally. I think he means in a situation where he's with a group that doesn't make him fret over rage efficiency, he'd like to make things easier for the healer.
---
Nah because even if you tell them to continue drinking while you build aggro, that mage with 600 mana left is gonna hop right up and start fighting the moment you pull.
---
But it can be if you limit time played in battlegrounds.
---
This will never be actual PvP.
---
This will always be 3 scrubs who can't handle anyone at their own level trying to feel powerful.
---
This isn't PvP, this is just legal murder.
---
Literally any response: ...
---
200iq redditors: LOL U MAD?
---
Good job they have that higher level priest with them
---
I mean sure, but everyone ends up tagged anyway if you're going there to fight
---
Fuck those anklebiters
---
U mad doe
---
as cool as thunderfury is, the neck is more amazing to me... bis raiding neck with FR for MC and NR for AQ
---
He got outplayered
---
Awesome! Found him. That was fun.  Thanks!
---
how do you do into non UD rogues
---
From my experimenting slice and dice is really situational. 
---
A lot of time I end up lower on dps chart using SND then just using eviscerate every 5 stacks. I am playing a swords build and have good but not great gear. I think value of SND is very gear dependent if you crit a lot it prob has more value. In short fights it is almost always worse than eviscerate.
---
I've found optimal time to use SND for raid bosses is right after using thistle tea to build up 5 combo points fast. That way you minimise downtime on eviscerate.
---
Using this method I managed to top dps on a few of my guilds mc boss fights - magmadar and lucifron, The week before I was way lower in the charts and was using a different approach which was periodically keeping up snd using 2-3 combo points to refresh it.
---
I would actually kinda wanna see how it is for horde on Gehennas cus i play alliance there and what you described felt exactly like my experience there. Sounds like both factions on our server are suffering from the pvp a bit haha
---
Why are you asking Reddit? Shouldn't this be in an email or support ticket to blizzard?
---
Pre war.mode, it mattered a lot more than now.  It's basically an irrelevant distinction now.
---
Pretty sure that's a human alliance that was killed on a flight master. Very, very easy to escape.
---
I play ally and I agree with it. Everyone should have expected FP camping on a pvp server.. 5:1 faction imbalance and massive roaming death squads preventing questing in entire zones for days at a time is one thing, but being surprised people are camping FPs?
---
I would like to read about this, too.
---
F
---
Asmon is a tool, but this guy is also riding on Asmon's popularity for clicks.
---
The demand will only increase, if not for a short period of time. Expect them to go up a significant amount as twinking in classic is going to be bigger than retail imo.
---
Again, the Mage is using FAP in response to your FAP, so that won't work.
---
It was actually quite satisfying when I found him, it took me probably 5 minutes.
---
Lost it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
What's the ballpark figure on performing the maneuver? Seems like an expensive way to win one skirmish.
---
If you want cheap gear for lvling look for level 20, 30, 40, etc and gear ending in 1 or 2. They are all useless for twinks so are likely to be significantly cheaper.
---
"PVP" is a pretty broad term.  BGs are different than WPVP, and a class will be better in some BGs than others.
---
As in the cookie cutter pve spec.
---
Onto YouTube live he goes
---
I prefer a fair fight, but if people had to wait every time an enemy was full HP and mana, 80% of wpvp would never happen.
---
feel free to provide damning evidence of advertise 100% stream sniping.
---
My only concern though is going into it 15 years behind, how will I catch up in terms of gold, items etc and would there be any other players levelling up alongside me for dungeons and quests etc.
---
Main reason I got into classic was because I saw it as a 'new' MMO that I can get into and therefore not be hopelessly behind 99% of the player base.
---
Doesn't matter got honor
---
I play both, faerlina and herod, both factions and I think it doesnt matter what anyone thinks there is a fact, the fact is wpvp is a shitshow.
---
Bg's wont fix the problem, blizzard needs to make alterations or more subs will be lost.
---
Might as well just play 30 Feral / 21 Resto at that point. The only reason to go tri-spec (IMO) is for the extra range on your spells, but your build doesn't get that.
---
Funnily enough WoW was actually designed to be able to be played with one hand. Internet cafes are popular in Asia and often people smoke while playing games. Learned tbis from one of the documentaries
---
Wow great advice with the ghosts. Thank you.
---
Hunter
---
&lt;No reason provided&gt;
---
Am alliance on Gehennas and we literally never control any of the zones. We managed to hold BRM for 30 minutes the other day just 15 of us agains 47 horde, but then it was backpedaling to BRS and portal home. As soon as horde hears there's a smaller group around they'll gather the masses and hunt us down. We had a small 7 people group, won a few skirmishes, then suddenly got the 30member zerg treatment.
---
I tried to enter DME today at 1am, guess what, menethil/boat camped, feathermoon fp/boat camped, dme camped by zergs. And actually I did record.
---
Are you sure you playing on Gehennas?
---
Eh it's alright, but the trees always get in the way camera. Not nearly as bad as Dustwallow Marsh, but still highly annoying.
---
I play horde on this server, it's honestly amazing the coordination that the alliance has here, numerous massive guilds that all seem to work really closely together. Meanwhile we can barely support another guild for a world boss kill. Really has me considering rerolling
---
I woulda loved to run wailnig caverns
---
no they dont. horde have tons of 55 guards in good spots, alliance either have literally none, or level 40s/20s (yes 20) in horrible spots.
---
From what I gathered he was stream sniping asmon. Also having his viewers allegedly going into esphans stream and harassing him. Both if I am not mistaken are against the TOS. Personally I find it entertaining and he should not have been banned. However it is understandable. 
---
This really has nothing with ganking but the actions of advertise. I hope this sheds some light.
---
Sure and that sucks and I support alliance wanting transfers to more balanced servers or more alliance favored servers.
---
But game mechanics saying that you are getting ganked too much and telling horde that they can't play the game are two very different things.
---
How does it work?
---
This has happened to me several times. You just rez and fly away, it's not hard. Then you come back with your squad and get revenge.
---
&gt; their time playing as Roseanne Barr in a dress.
---
okay that made me laugh.
---
Where is he?
---
I never said that you should not powershift. You should. But you should also use your other spells. Personal DPS is not important - only raid DPS.
---
Ironic that you would say Rebirth is only used while your raid is failing. In my opinion, your raid is failing if a Druid is in the top 10 on DPS.
---
Okay so hunting a player down in a world-based pvp video game is harassing...?
---
That’s you op isn’t it?
---
Im not 100% sure but I’d assume there are 10 black lotus spawn points in silithus so he/she has the toons parked at each spawn and then when a black lotus spawns the ride in on their 60 and grab it.
---
Obviously can’t deal with a pvp server KEK
---
/s
---
I understand exactly what the problem is, I just think your solution is unacceptable.
---
But why? 
---
That’s how you want to spend your time ? 
---
Just seems like there’s two types of people. 
---
People who have empathy. 
---
And people who thinking grieving others is fun. 
---
It’s a bit sadistic and sociopathic TBH.
---
But it’s totally understandable that we would have a much higher concentration of mental/personality disorders hooked on this game. And likely EVEN HIGHER concentration in these forums.
---
Show some empathy people. 
---
Just cus someone is a deusche canoe doesn’t mean it’s OK for you to be one too. 
---
Turn the other cheek. 
---
Treat others how you would like to be treated. 
---
The community would be so much better if the majority could play this way.
---
Long ass post. But well enough written that it was interesting to read. Felt like a short story.
---
no idea, dumb balance
---
If only Alliance could pvp as well as they meme.
---
I'm not surprised people in PvE gar don't even try.
---
So you are against the free server transfers that have been offered for a long time now?
---
Most big streamers are just cancer and probably also one of the reasons retail became so bad because Blizzard listened too much on the shit they talked...
---
&gt; (looking at all the +spirit crap on blacksmithing armor)
---
+spirit is amazing for leveling. It significantly decreaed downtime on my rogue.
---
Where is the proof that he stream sniped Asmongold? Provide it please.
---
So im a nelf with DB mh and Viskag oh. (Got edgemasters). How good is that?
---
Honestly, I don't think so. Remember, back in the day of WoW Vanilla, we had really dedicated people greifing themselves to make names for themselves.
---
I don't really see a problem here. He is targeting a streamer, yes, but he is also targeting the guild leader or the biggest guild on that faction. It isn't unreasonable to target this person. You see Olympus everywhere on that server, so you want to naturally take down the guild leader to cause the most havoc.
---
Yeah I know lol. People arrive at both from grom gol still tagged and the people trying to kill alliance will just tag themselves. That's what I mean by everyone ends up tagged
---
You mixed up the Horde and Alliance :S
---
That was nerfed almost immediately so ally could keep winning.  Nah I mean enclosed capture points, chokepoints where archers rain death down( and are in the top ten NPCs that killed players), graveyards right next to capture points, horde bases that can be utterly skipped.
---
For los pulls shackle is an excellent way to initiate. Shackle, run los, Pally consecrates, mobs run into consecrate. 
---
For non-los pulls then the priest should mindblast after consecrate to pull the mob off the aoe then shackle. Or just dont shackle. Fade will get rid of the aggro once the shackle breaks.
---
You just repeat Asmongold's fake news he spread. Where is the proof that Advertise stream sniped Asmongold?
---
Rogues are ez until they do that.
---
Are jump runs worth it on mages? Or is zf more time efficient?
---
Nethergarde-keep is 70-80% alliance, yet it's easy for groups and horde has 4 guilds in top 10 speedclears MC for the server.
---
If you want to play the game, then don't stream. If you want to go to work and get paid, you deal with the shitty work environment and ow through it like every other fucking person who lives and breathes. **Fuck streamer privilege**
---
I loved world pvp back in Vanilla, but I knew this would be terrible due to the population and gamers being more competitive than they were in 2004. I rolled PvE in classic. If I want PvP, there's always a massive battle in Southshore 24/7. I feel like I made a good choice.
---
Umm.. I thought demo shout and tab shield slam/sunder/revenge was like... THE way to tank? What am I missing here 😂
---
Of course they don't have any proof, but Asmongold's fan boys will just repeat the fake news they were told by their god.
---
That’s really slow, but since you’re new that’s to be expected.
---
Make sure you tip your hat a few times. Rank 14 wont be attainable without account sharing on most servers.
---
The best part is how that one rogue strafes around like he's at in the blizzcon arena world chamionship finals.
---
Temp bans have always been a thing it's not a "zoomer thing".
---
Maybe they were rarer in the dawn of the internet (yes I was there too).  But they certainly existed.
---
Then post me the link to the video which provides evidence and name the exact timestamp.
---
The point of your thread was to cap battleground playtime, so the response for every ranker is to get as much as you can out of that battleground playtime and wpvp for the rest.  What do you mean there will not be wpvp when bgs are out, you're literally asking them to keep it in.
---
I mean if twitch banned him they probably have his logs for what he was watching lol. They don't have to publicize it.
---
Yeah, there is actually a Warlock tank spec that isn't that bad. Deep DEMO with a VW pet, high armor cloth pieces and Demon armor. Have a PAL hit you with CONC Aura to avoid pushback and spam Searing pain.
---
You know what's even better than slightly regenerating faster without food? Killing stuff in shorter fights, therefore taking fewer hits and requiring fewer hit points healed. Especially true for rogues with their gameplay focused around damage avoidance from their target.
---
Lol why would you talk about the other faction when they dont exist on your server kek
---
Same on Sulfuras.  Having no "twitch streamer impact".
---
It's a good weapon, especially if you can't commit to farming DR MH which is an insanely low drop rate and took me 35 runs to get. Kroll Blade and Mirah's Song will do you just fine.
---
&gt;Can't have those pesky Allies ganking Hordies freshly arriving from contested zones!
---
Except Rogues park themselves on the hills outside Orgrimmar all the time, when the Zep from Grom'gol arrives that's where you drop to get to the city quicker, rogue then just stuns you and takes the other 20-30% of your hp
---
Yes but if you were in a duel as a horde against a horde and ended up mind controlling an alliance player- it would cause honorless target to be removed from the alliance player. It’s a bug/categorized under bug abuse. There was a post on the front page recently that showed a GM whispering a priest informing them that mind controlling the enemy faction while in a duel is a bannable offense as it’s not intended.
---
Which is exactly what you said- there should NOT be a way to remove honor less target.. and the only way to do so is 100% bug abuse.
---
I mean, why? Answer the question instead of looking like an complete moron.
---
"you're smart"
---
Flight masters being hostile like neutral town guards and boats getting their crews back would solve a lot of this I think.
---
What doors/vaults etc can a Rogue NOT open and thus need to get the respectvie keys?
---
You're suggesting that in the same thread that people are talking about how their death run strategy to the Menethil boats can be done with only two deaths and the swimming into Theramore to avoid those docks.
---
Mages are just the new hunter.   Everyone knew hunter was the quickest and easiest way to level through questing back in the day hence there were a shit ton of "huntards".  Mages getting that role isn't really a new phenomen isolated to just twitch.  Word got out in more places than twitch streams about the aoe grinding in dungeons and world.
---
This thread is gold. 
---
I’ve never heard of either of these two deusche canoes before reading this thread. 
---
They both seem like jackassess.
---
So many fanboys in this thread blindly defending their hero and deflecting accusations while simultaneously throwing back LITERALLY THE EXACT SAME ACCUSATIONS AT THE OTHER GUY.
---
YOUR GUY HARRASSED MY GUY.
---
WELL YOUR GUY SAID MEAN WORDS WHICH IS HARRASSMENT.
---
NO ITS NOT. MY GUY DIDNT HARRASS YOUR GUY BECAUSE SAYING MEAN WORDS ISNT HARRASSMENT. STREAM SNIPING AND GANKING IS HARRASSMENT. 
---
NO IT ISNT. YIUR GUY IS A HARRASSSER.
---
NO HE ISNT. YOUR GUY IS A HARRASSSER.
---
You are all SO invested in your favorite superstar ASSHOLE twitch streamer. 
---
THEY ARE BOTH ASSHOLES FIND SOMEONE CHILL TO WATCH.
---
They are CLEARY both assholes. Jerks. Selfish narcissists.
---
Why is it always complete jerks who are the most popular?
---
Jup they would blow all mana on pom pyro and blastwave the second you pulled if they could and than start wanding, mages be weird
---
Which others would be valuable then at that point?
---
I was the only person on my vanilla server that fished azshara and I made obscene amounts of gold as a holy priest.
---
THEY
---
Burrrr
---
On Grobb I can't even remember the last time I've seen a solo Horde questing. They always do easy to solo quests in groups of 2-4. Really makes wpvp boring when you can't even get enjoyable fights over quests because you get zerged there too.
---
There are Twitch streamers that have been doing it for awhile without any issues.
---
Yeah it is, it does suck though as asmon literally just gets ganked whenever he streams. 
---
But that's why advertise banned on twitch and not wow yet
---
Huh? How is farming honour sad? It's the main activity of the game at this point and was always a huge part of Vanilla.
---
I hate to say it but yes, anyone can put in time for rank 11.  Rank 11 is nothing compared to R14, for which you need both absurd time and skill.
---
Rank 11 is a great feat, it is super hard to do.  However, imagine everyone that pushed into rank 11 like you did.  You can rank 11 off of bracket 4, which has 10 times as many slots as rank 14.  To be in the top 10% of everyone that has the time to rank that high takes -you guessed it- skill aswell.
---
I mean wow does and always has banned for you for excessive cursing despite the filter. I'm literally perma bamned in LOL for it as well.
---
As we so eloquently call it in our language, "top kek".
---
OEB is an amazing weapon and can easily be better dps than everything you've listed, assuming that you're getting the hang of the 2h fury slam rotation. It falls behind in fights where mobility is important, because of slam in the rotation, or if dealing with latency or otherwise clipping the swing timer with slam.
---
So the best option is probably to raid with a guild and build up some kudos to get bigger and better options in later phases... IMO... by letting others kit out. Possibly just putting a Flurry Axe in the bank for a rainy day when you might eventually get a kickass 1h axe, like Nefarian's or the AQ axe.
---
The phases are going fast and p3 will be here before you know it.
---
Yeah but if you're a Druid who doesn't want to heal you're fucked for loot inside raid, there are literally 3 items for feral in both MC and Ony combined.
---
DKP on another player? That is next level!
---
GRATS OP! I'm a professional kickboxing space alien and astronaut marine who just hit level 20 on Classic as well! It was hard to find the time between fighting Nazis on the moon and curing cancer back on earth, but I did it!
---
Yup never been corpse camped ever
---
The #nochanges gang always does, conveniently
---
"Exactly as it was." With 12k people on a server instead of a 3k like it used to be.
---
The real issue is that then roaming raids of level 47 'gankers' would be untouchable by 60s. A better solution would be for honorific targets to not be pvp flagged.
---
Cool, can you level my priest from 47-60? Thanks
---
There won't be massive amounts of people out in the world actively seeking out wpvp opportunities in battlegrounds come out.  That would obviously have a negative effect on how much honor you can farm in the world.
---
I'm on a PvE server, and just having the option to pvp if I want to is a god send. Those who want some pvp action goes to hillsbrad and try to snipe  a horde player camping Ott.
---
I play Horde on Heartseeker and the ally 100% do this lol. Took 38 mins for my 5 man squad to zone into BRD.
---
This post literally made me pee my pants 😂
---
I'm curious why this was removed, but I thought someone might have asked and found this when I searched.
---
I contacted the creator and discovered the site registration has expired.
---
The guide is still available at https://wickstjo.github.io/vanilla-questing/.
---
Furthermore, you can download it at https://github.com/wickstjo/vanilla-questing and run it on your own computer using the instructions there.
---
Its more just problems with server imbalance, Like heartseeker being Alliance dominated 85/15 in a more extreme example and Faerlina being Horde dominated by 60/40 I personally play on Faerlina and can tell you that its pretty horrible when it comes to the horde owning every farming spot most days and anytime you want to do lvl 60 dungeons you have to go through a 1-2 hour corpse run to get there.
---
I too want to be an officer of breakfast.
---
Ubrs
---
Onyxia
---
Hit the nail on the head
---
Blizzard would have to be smart enough to realize making the server pop 10x larger would be an issue to know something was coming. It would not surprise me at all if they looked at 10x servers numbers and went "It'll be fine, what are they gonna do camp every FP and graveyard all day? pffff, relax they wouldn't do that to themselves"....
---
Eyyyy Raheem my boy!
---
I mean it's still against ToS, which is still a joke.
---
The problem with the current wPVP is that 99% of the time, there is a side that wants to wpvp and another side that was just passing by getting ganked. There is no battle. There is a single sided massacre
---
I was around for it too.
---
People also didn’t/aren’t considering how ramping up server sizes increased density. There are only so many zones and quests and farms. 
---
Increasing the server sizes with the same sq. yard zones and mobs, then stacking on 3:1 faction imbalances.
---
That’s *nothing* like vanilla. Anyone who was around knows it’s not.
---
I PvP isn’t the problem. Pops and imbalances, they absolutely are.
---
It's slightly above Krol in DPS actually, at least for rogues.
---

Hes gonna start a new guild, not join one
---
&gt;DB mh and Viskag oh
---
DB is the best mainhand right now for you. Brutality Blade, Core Hound Tooth, or Felstriker would be better in the offhand. If you're using dense sharpening stones (these give more DPS to fast weapons), then even Bonescraper or the Flurry Axe would be better in the offhand. Bonescraper is relatively easy to farm and doesn't really cost anything. You can switch to Viskag OH if you're using some elemental sharpening stones or keep it for the purple. Unfortunately DB and Viskag both play the role of hard hitting slow mainhand.
---
In p3, there's a clear upgrade path to the Doom's Edge offhand, which drops off trash in BWL, because of less competition for axes than for swords and daggers on alliance.
---
Elemental shaman. No question.
---
Unlucky with boss drops or shitty loot rules?
---
It's more damage total, if you just spam shadowbolt you'll be life tapping while others are getting more efficient use of mana with dots only being a shadowbolt behind.

Perhaps you've already seen this, but he's set it up to run on github now:

Oh I'm sure it does take an absurd amount of time, I've never alluded to it not requiring that time.  I just think it's unjust to say it takes no skill at all.  There are more people with the amount of time than there are people that can hit r14, so there's competition.  It will always be a competition of skill between those that have the time to play.  Without the time, you're not in the race, but you still have to be good to win the race.
---
And I 100% agree with you as far as not trying, I have no intention of ranking to 14.  For where I am currently in my life, it's not feasible.  But everyone is living under different circumstances.
---
was there a limit to server population back then ? no ? then they just gave the exact same thing , for sure what u got wasn't the same and anyone could see it wouldn't be thanks to private servers that is.
---
Rogue is the best, every class has a counter. Rogues have to option to not fight them. Vanish away and fight something else
---
Sword of Zeal is still better.
---
yeah the bosses dropped nothing druid
---
our boomer did get staff of dominance tho
---
Says the guy who wrote 2 paragraphs defending a streamer from an obvious joke
---
You will not learn the tricks to tanking by levelling 1-60, even if you tank every instance in the game. You'll have to dive pretty deep into guides and theorycrafting to get there.
---
Warrior is also the only hard class in vanilla.
---
I really dislike when people say this since it's such a meme but this really seems like you should have rolled on a pve server instead of whining about pvp when or how you don't want it when you play on a pvp server.
---
aw didn't see that

Yeeeeah.  His YouTube videos mention Asmon for the likes and views, but his TWITCH world did not revolve around ganking Asmond.  Even Asmond boot lickers that ventured over to Advertise's channel to view (see: harass, QQ) content would agree that he didn't "harass" Asmon any more than any other alliance on Faerlina (PVP server, 'Alliance owned'l
---
The whole ban stems from QQs that should've rolled PVE.
---
The clintons killed him sorry
---
Oof.
---
what raid frames are those?
---
I thought bandages didn't work in BGs aren't there special bandages you can buy from the BG-factions?
---
Everything looks fun with rose tinted glasses.
---
There are reasons to be out in the world other than pvp.  The AQ/pre-Naxx consumable grind is very real, there will be no shortage of players to find in the world to kill for honor.
---
Yet all the complaints on reddit are coming from alliance
---
Nope, all you had to do was scratch off the stuff to reveal the code, and then enter it on Blizzard's site.
---
Since asmon is going to retail: If asmon ignores advertise entirely, it's extremely likely that Advertise's popularity drops dramatically. A 7 day ban for someone that doesn't have a long term established viewer base can really tank their viewership.
---
haha we got someone on our server named Mom who makes outfits/clothes :D
---
I keep hearing this over and over but I guess I just suck. I’m a hunter and no matter what class I’m Fucked.... 
---
Warlock, fear and dot = ded
---
Rogue, cc perla stun = ded
---
Warrior charge can’t get range, =ded
---
Pally... most of the time even fight bubble hearth=live no honor 
---
Mage, if they dead one me ded... sometime even?
---
Preist, ya know I never have 1v1 pvped a priest, but I hear sPreist are strong so idk 
---
Druid, lol you can’t kill a Druid silly...
---
Other hunter, even
---
No shit einestin, thats literally what my entire post is about lol. I should have rolled pve
---
Lol what a terrible correlation
---
Jesus Christ, is farming black lotus worth $165 a month?
---
Doesn't spy work through the combat log?  I don't think that'd do anything here.
---
Thanks alot:)
---
Basically the way honor in classic works, is that you're put into a certain bracket of all the players on your realm who qualify (15/25hk, depending on honor per kill), now the people pushing for rank 12+ pretty much need to be in the very top, like 0.5%, to prevent the weekly rank decay from eating all their progress.   
---
Usually PvP cliques form, with groups of tankers pushing extremely hard trading of who gets the nr 1 slot for the week, to get rank 14.
---
Basically, you *could* do what you describe in the op, and fuck over someone at the top.
---
In theory.
---
In reality, unless you're planning to play 12-16 hours per day, in an effective premade that smokes the opposition in sub 5 minutes, it's not going to happen.
---
To be in those top brackets, you've got to play genuinely obscene amounts of time.
---
I'm not sure whether or not the statement "You can only gain one pvp rank per week beyond 4" is true or not. If it is, then yes you only need to gain 5000 honour + your decay to gain one per week. Keeps working until pretty high in the rank board.
---
But I've heard people say this isn't true, so I'm don't know.
---
*laughs in feint and vanish*
---
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS
---
I know what ad hominem is, are you sure you do? You are literally calling them assholes just for playing the game how it's ment to be played. Complain to Blizzard for designing the ranking system. They "act this way" because that's how the honor system works. Not only that but you are generalizing literally every Horde player, even those who don't do any pvp, because hey Horde players don't deserve shorter queues because they are all "irredeemable assholes". You are just mad for being farmed for honor and spewing insults because of it.
---
Wait how is he describing himself
---
I mean I dont know the cost of gold, but if it's something like 10USD per 100g, then basically every lotus you get is 10 dollars. You only need to secure 16.5 lotus a month to have it pay for itself.
---
&gt; Advertise’s entire purpose was to target asmongold. 
---
my problem is that if he wants to do that, he has all the right to do it, classic wow is a more sand box game and people have to have the right to do those kinds of things. he will probably keep doing all that stuff regardless of his twitch / youtube ( and probably harder ) and thats where i have conflict.  
---
what constitutes a harassment? because seeing this situation, its seems that harassment is when somebody streams it or makes a video about it, not the action itself.
---
Nice of him.
---
they gonna lose them without balanced populations anyways being camped from the start of ur login till the end is not what i subscribed for this is not like vanilla was they should put layering in again because this is double or tripple the amount of ppl in the world it's not gonna work out like this bg's will not fix this since horde have to wait longer in queues
---
oh, i'm not leaving herod.
---
When you can effectively get together a "roaming raid" of lvl 47s, I'd actually consider that a problem. But I don't think anyone's going to go "oh shit we're getting killed by lvl 60s camping every last flight path. Quick lets all spend 50+ hours getting to exactly level 47 and never progress past it."
---
kargath at high tide
---
PVP to PVE transfers happened in vanilla.
---
What WASN'T in vanilla was servers with higher than 2.5k player caps. Where's the *\#nochanges* crowd on that.
---
When you shit yourself while doing bgs, you have enough honor for that week.
---
You're not fighting vs. pugs.  You're fighting vs. the other premades on your server that want to get more honor than you.  There are probably 4-6 br1 slots on your server, and a whole lot more than that who are willing to play 16+ hours a day for r14 items.  When everyone's playing like that, the only way to get ahead is winning more premade vs. premade than they are.
---
What are the dungeons I should run as a lvl 50 warrior? 
---
ZF is easy xp and can do it pretty quick. Ulda doesn’t give nearly as much xp, also nobody runs Mara. I know that would be the best for the stonehearth ring or what ever it’s called. But in all my hours I have spent between 48-51 I have managed to get into one princess run and that’s because a lvl 60 guildy invited me. Not a single full Mara run. 
---
Can I get my guild mate to trade me the summoning crystal for Mara? Or is it not tradeabel?
---
Does castsequence macros work in classic?
---
Nope. I beta’d and played classic up till around BWL, through P2 on a high pop PvE server. Population matters. It’s not hard to understand how if you put 3x the number of people in the same size box, it increases interactions and decreases space where you can get away.
---
I could always fuck off to BFE Azshara or a  dozen other spots and it was like P2 changed nothing. That’s not at all true now. It’s got nothing to do with information or “player nature”, it’s more people in the same size world.
---
All of those other things are relevant, but to say pop size is an excuse or irrelevant is beyond absurd.
---
Dwarven guards use the npc version of thunderclap, which is an aoe slow. Very annoying.
---
he probably walked while he was dead and used the spirit rezzer in Silithus anyways.
---
The point is that he scammed a bunch of people out of money, and more importantly time. The quality of the weapon has nothing to do with this being a shitty thing to do.
---
Worth noting that whilst equipping a weapon causes gcd, you can equip a weapon during gcd. So you could Ambush, and immediately equip your sword, effectively not losing any of the gcd.
---
er.... it was the original name dude ! (definitely not a typo)
---
Thanks for the chuckle friend
---
I don't know I thought I'd ask ya
---
Interesting that at one point, Gnomeregan had a level requirement lower than Deadmines. I guess they figured giving all the new players PTSD on their first dungeon run was a bad idea. I still hear those alarmbots in my sleep.
---
I thought someone took his name? I could be wrong tho
---
this pains me. think of the world buffs expiring. *think of the world buffs*.
---
I still don't see the correlation here man.
---
How would that stop anything?
---
I'm sorry you made the mistake of selecting a ganking server.
---
If you like the game, just re-roll onto PvE, and flag up when you want to PvP.
---
#  HEELLLOOOOO EVERYY BOODDYYYYY

"Oh hey let's give alliance an underground passage way between the two largest cities that can only be accessed by running deep into the capital!"
---
enjoy being camped all night!
---
THIS IS WHY I PLAY CLASSIC WOW! The drama is second to none!
---
A random mage could have casted detect magic on him and the addon picked up the buffs.
---
Rogue tears. This does put a smile on my face
---
You mean apart from Badlands, where you have to run through STV Duskwood Redridge Mountain and trek across Burning Steppes and pass through Satan mountain which is always Alliance controlled on Razorgore and then Searing Gorge before having to corpse walk the last 400 yards to Kargath as there is always an alliance raid parked outside.
---
But I do agree that the alliance have it worse
---
Yeah a random mage must have casted it on every alliance in the city then
---
Seems my ganking has been effective lmao
---
Time to return to Gnome slaughter

More like over the age of 30. Golden eye was released in '97, making it over 22 years old ATM.

Get to the flight master only to realize it's dead and is being camped by a 15man raid group.

What I'm trying to say is the ban is nonsense. Like you said, these are game mechanics.

I bet a large percent of players dont even stop to read the quests or books provided for the quests. The story to Morgan Ladmoore is superbly sad.
---
Not sure that's the same guy.  I think you are remembering the rare mechnostrider guy.  He tried to sell his account on eBay and blizz caught wind of it and took it away.  If I could find the armory I think I legion the warrior was still wearing the necklace.
---
Also, I want to add... for his "off spec", he is auctioning them in AH.  https://imgur.com/oYHcn8P
---
The answer here is play as much as you like.  
---
Dont limit your habits because you are in essence doing better than your competition.
---
The guys aiming for r14 arent going to do you any favors, theyre out for themselves, if you wanna play bgs all day every day do so.
---
I’m in a situation as well. I bought a krol blde today for 330g but I haven’t equipped it yet. Not sure what to do
---
Can I join your pug ha? Been 4 weeks trying to down Rag in our guild. So much melee dying before phase 2 and feels like our DPS isn’t enough.
---
Was Ony this weird back in the day? I feel Ony is so RNG that if not even one of your tanks picks her up you’re f’ed.
---
52 years 😂
---
Actually the main problem is the server size. When you have a world designed for like 4k to 5k people and them you cram in 15k people... well this is going to happen.
---
#nochanges is already broken by changing server caps.
---
Still think its even?
---
No,  it's not.  Every dps check from the warrior discord has sword of zeal a few dps behind.  It's cheaper,  not better.
---
At this point they should just make honorless targets immune to pvp damage and cc. Shits fucking stupid.
---
Can you send mail cross server in classic?
---
I was told that the +100 hp legs enchant wasn't in the game yet. Is that true?
---
I treat my girls right. She gets popcorn and buncha crunch
---
I had this happen to me several times today, trust me between 5-8 of them they can attack faster than you can right click the flight master, click the option to show flight paths, and click a flight path no matter what.
---
I think dragon islands were supposed to be where Magister’s Terrace ended up being.
---
A simple meme someone gave gold.
---
Depends on what you plan to do. Are you looking to be DPS, tank, heals? Will you be primarily raiding or doing PVP? Playing mostly solo?
---
/spit on them then /dance
---
Omg fucking tryhard. Slow down and let the casuals have some fun too. Stop acting like the game is a job.
---
Sounds like OP got schlonged by horde lmao 
---
Stay salty boyo
---
Your link seems to be broken. Says the video is private.
---
The guy's a bit of a knob but the more serious question is what UI are you using?
---
Not quite. If you picked a specific number ahead of time, the odds of two people getting that number is 1/10000, because the odds of one person getting that number is 1/100.
---
If you remove the requirement for a specific number, the odds of one person getting ANY number between 1 and 100 is 1/1. The odds of the second person rolling a specific number (whatever number the first guy rolled) is then 1/100. 1/1 x 1/100 is 1/100.
---
And lead to a flagged Menethil while Horde have either both points on their territory or one havily guarded by goblins.
---
It literally isn’t that though lmfao. I raid with him, I’m in his guild, and we voice com. He does it for fun and still does it cus he thinks it’s funny to see him rage.
---
No it fucking doesn't. As a shaman you have no idea how hard that quality farm guides are to find. Please do explain how a box off to the side cheapens this video at all.
---
More like Un-fairlena
---
There's a lot more than 3...
---
Quick strike ring, wristguards of stability, firegaurd shoulders, finkles lava dredger, band of accuria, dragons blood cape, onyxia  tooth pendant, and aged core leather gloves are solid after your dagger players get it. Oh, potentially heavy dark iron ring as well. Maybe more I'm forgetting
---
...really. come on man. It does happen, maybe not often but to say literally never. Is this how you muck up solid issues, with a ridiculous comment?
---
Very close-minded of you and u/KrimsonWow 
---
You two are obviously fan-boys of this person that got banned. My comment said that the ganking and the in-game pvp was all a game mechanic, putting asmon on blast in all his streams and building his community around the bottom feeders that love drama and hate Asmongold and using the Twitch platform to harrass him outside of game is cyber-bullying and against twitch TOS
---
Your ability to selectively read my first comment is astounding and even as I write this I'm certain you will do it again to this comment.
---
&gt; forced
---
Yes, PVP servers mean PVP may be mandatory.
---
Where is he? Someone PM me
---
I maybe use greater heal like 10 times an entire MC raid.
---
If you are a priest and using greater heal and flash heals....you are not playing correctly.
---
I've got a 60 Hunter. To supplement the other reply I would say that you can do what you say here but you have to feign immediately after the early multishot. You won't actually pull aggro since the shots land as you're feigning. But, as he said, if you pull the mobs away from the tanking zone you're causing problems.

QuickTime, accrual, not head, 24 STR BRACER, DARK IRON, steadfast might

By my research it is. Kombucha is a druid on Fairbanks according to warcraft logs

I thought I was the only one. Whenever I mute someone, the entire chat is gone. It's weird. Next time I'll try reloading my UI.

That's why we need dicks. Because dicks fuck assholes.

Not entirely accurate, our 2 warriors do very well 2 hand Fury.

I read this response when you posted it. And this is the bug reason why to not do this.
---
My job sucks. I manage a "Luxury Doggy Daycare &amp; Spa" - what this really means is I clean piss and shit off the walls and floors and occasionally get bit. This part of my life sucks...
---
But, when I'm rolling around in WoW - decked out in full blues and greens, I'm invincible.  I fly into Booty Bay at level 45 and head out into the jungle, knowing that my insta-crit chain lightning will delete those two level 35 questers without a second thought. 
---
But no, not this time. A level 50 Paladin (who has no business being in STV) drops some terrorist level bombs that stun, bend me over, and open my ass for a rude awakening on the "Deliverance" level... it's over in the blink of an eye. My night ruined. Fists clinched so hard my nails are digging into the skin as I rage quit. 
---
But, then I remember... I have an exceptionally large penis, and all of a sudden, balance is once again restored to my life.

Are you saying that Asmongold was asking for it? Was he wearing a too revealing dress or something?
---
Yeah, all 10% of them.

Major mana potions

Back in the day I had no clue how to get them and dreamfoil was stupid hard to get. I just do lasher runs and get a million dreamfoil and spend 45 min picked up tons of icecaps in winter spring.

Name of the model changing addon? How likely it is to get banned using it?
---
Damn...
---
Farming 3000g is still easier than farming dalrend main hand
---
There are always 5 rogues in gromgols flight tower
---
&gt;oh fuck no. old itemization was a big pile of garbage lol.
---
Yes, and that was the point. Starting with 1.7 to compensate somewhat for the 1.12.1 class design and talents to make the initial content somewhat more difficult and more in line with early vanilla.
---
&gt;also dont play on one of the "big" servers and youll have a way better time in the game.
---
Bigger servers are better. If you don't want to play on them most high pop servers have free transfers to unpopular realms.
---
Because I have seen many subs loosing their bliss because of that and it is saddening for our community
---
ehh, not all guild use the bis raid comp.  My guild has 5 druids for some ungodly reason.
---
Which helps menethil harbor or dustwallow marsh exactly zero. Compare Morgan’s vigil - zero guards, to kargath - tons of 55 guards which spawn and protect the town. Everywhere you look horde have the advantage
---
You some kind of idiot?
---
Red flag #1: This person was impatient to craft Hand of Rag. Why take out a loan when you could just spend weeks gathering the mats. What was the extreme hurry getting it crafted?
---
Kudos on you for trying to pay off the debt. I hope the Eye drops for you again and that lucky person takes their time crafting the hammer. :)
---
Opposite on mograin
---
The difference is for normal travel you can remain safe, alliance cannot. If you do fight, you have 55 guards nearby, while alliance have level 40 or level 20, and not even that close by.
---
Oh im not calling it unfair, i was wondering why people do it instead of getting actual honor. now I see why lmao
---
Somebody, copy+paste this as a donation message to him and watch him try for an Olympic gold medal in mental gymnastics.
---
Mail Enhancement
---
My soul, ow
---
No, but it would basically be a massive nerf to every class (especally casters) early on, and make the initial 60 content "more in line" with what it was in vanilla early on.
---
1.12.1 classes are much more optimal and better designed than how they were in earlier patches, and thats why pservers likes to nerf the items early to somewhat compensate.
---
And for warriors that may well be true, but every sim from the rogue discord puts it ahead of Krol.
---
Almost like you can't fucking compare two different glasses mindlessly.
---
Gotcha
---
For a combat rogue is thrash blade and mirah's song better than thrash blade and dal rend OH?
---
Get good, obviously
---
30 percent of any pvp battle is who jumps whom. This is even more so depending on class.
---
As a rogue for instance you have a big advantage attacking first.
---
As a hunter it is really easy to avoid having other people catch you off guard. Once battlegrounds come out if you can keep your head on a swivel you'll feel like a god. You can out range every class I  the game and also have a higher movement speed than everyone else.
---
My rogue hates you.
---
Yup. Look at posts from 90+ days ago compared to now and it’s just a memefest now.
---
So your comparison to a horde raid taking over every boat is "if I jump off early I might get killed"?
---
Right.
---
Meh, I play on a horde dominated server, and it still feels like its alliance that's rolling through zones crushing everyone in a death ball.
---
Wow, so brave.  Thoughts and prayers.
---
Wouldn't that just respawn him in the graveyard closest to where he actually died?
---
But why would that be good? Molten Core is an entry raid. It's not supposed to be overly difficult.
---
0 evidence of steam sniping, if so show me.
---
Thanks for the info
---
think you're very unlikely to get any dps ring in MC as a feral druid
---
The servers were still hosted in the US with the same ping, though it was like 450 in those days. 
---
Oceanic servers hosted in Sydney didn't occur until 2014.
---
they still bested you tho
---
Nature is druids, Shamans are the Elements.
---
Shaman better pleb.

Then you have to factor in the fact his time is literally worth nothing for any of these calculations to work. But you can also factor in that this is actually really fun for him and it's priceless :)
---
That’s the island I was thinking of...so it was left completely scrapped
---
&gt; some people play for fun
---
Lies!
---
Awesome, thanks for that.
---
I remember winning so many 1v2's, and a few 1v3's. Ive won a total of two 2v1's in classic that was completely 100% fair, and it wasnt me bombing two people killing mobs. 
---
People know there stuff.
---
Oh?
---
Oh
---
Ooooooooh

👈😎👈

^idiot
---
Run to dungeons as a group. Meet up nearby beforehand.
---
Shhh Don’t tell anyone but grind timber maw hold rep and get transmute earth to water, ez 10-12g per day on my server
---
I dinged to 51 in ZF, 52 in Mara, 53 in ST and 54 in Felwood. I've done searing gorge now and a single run of BRD up to emperor (but didn't kill, 54 is too low to hold aggro). I'm one mob away from 55, and planning to get it during a BRD prison + arena run if I can find a group.
---
Maybe I'm an odd one, but Sulfuras just struck me as always a very weird weapon. It was hard to craft in classic, and frankly stupid to useless in PvE. Across almost every class that could use it. I played a ret paladin for a bit in Vanilla, don't understand how anyone could love the spec it was such trash. But that that aside, it wasn't that good. It was a meme weapon. 
---
I'd have held onto it and maybe waited a few months, but I mean Ashkandi is almost as good and easier to get come the next phase for Paladins. Besides the holy grail for every Paladin was the Rank 14 weapons.
---
stay mad ally
---
Molten core would be managable anyways, but people probably wouldn't get away with spell cleaving SM for instance, as everyone would be doing way less damage due to generally shittier stats on items.
---
I just think the initial content would have been a bit more fun that way, but either way I am fine with the current state as well.
---
&gt; Where in the rules does it say we can’t say certain words
---
[No hate-speech. Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and other discriminatory speech will be removed. [...] This is the one rule that usually results in an instant and permanent ban.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/rules#wiki_2._be_civil_and_respectful)
---
As for the other words you referenced, perhaps the mods don't think they're hate speech - or should be held to the same standard.
---
Fwiw, when you want to ask the mods a question, [sending them a modmail is better than making a post](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fclassicwow). Not that making a post is wrong, but you are gambling on them seeing it.
---
Damn, you live and you learn. Eve online taught me not to trust anyone lol.
---
I wish I could take 3 - 5 corpse runs going from TP to BRM
---
My advice is don't rush through the game and play it at your own pace, that's what classic is about
---
This is true. Very very few people know how to pvp well especially since they just bee lined to 60 and avoided low lvl pvp at all costs. Now they only excel in greater numbers which is why a 2v1 is common (no matter the faction).  
---
  
---
So while they may be wearing a lot better gear than back in the day, majority of them are just *terrible*. Oddly enough the skill floor hasnt really improved and you run into bad players every day.
---
why is everyone trying to make cunt a taboo word?  I am betting you wouldn't censor dick, which is the same thing.
---
&gt; I am not someone trying to white knight for Asmon
---
Okay buddy, whatever you say. If you wanna call it something else, whatever makes you feel better about spamming reddit posts to defend your favorite streamer.
---
You get ressed at your original spirit healer no matter where you click it in Classic.
---
in that case asmon should have been banned a long time ago then
---
Just curious, what are the restrictions?
---
Stick to arguing over tree species instead of lording over people about global cultural impact as if you're an authority on it amidst incorrectly identifying tree leaves over the internet.
---
Dude, Ace is just a stoner trying to kill monsters. No "Twitch Behaviour" from him to speak of. He's got a dumb name, but I attribute that to the dope.
---
Haha I agree. I hear it all the time from horde and see it.  But it goes both ways. And my server is very balanced on pvp and how active people are. Its horde areas one night alliance areas the next. On tuesdays with horde raiding the alliance sit 3 groups in BRM to camp. It’s always a fun time.
---
That sucks, both pugs I’ve been in downed rag.  Second we wiped three times before getting the kill.  Both groups were Saturday clears in 3-4 hours.  
---
The key to rag is greater fire protection potions and lots of them.  Bring 100 of them to your raid and charge people who didn’t bring their own.
---
I was in ubrs with a gnome mage called "iamgnome"
---
There was another mage who is also a gnome. 
---
When the leader issue order "gnome this gnome that" it get a bit of confusing.
---
I’d drop both honestly. Tailoring is good for your robe of the arch mage and then drop it like it’s hot. It’s too easy to relevel to justify keeping for little money. Go mining engineering till phase 4 for money and pvp. Drop mining when phase 4 comes out and buy your way back up in tailoring.
---
For most, it doesn’t. 
---
I’ve seen one on my server now for sale from the same person for weeks and no one has bought it.
---
This wasn't the reason for the ban though, apparently it was harassment of a twitch partner. Most of Advertise's content has been centered around Asmongold in some shape or form that has been entirely negative and that's against Twitch TOS. Don't think Twitch cares about ganking.
---
I'm actually not surprised by the amount of whining and flaming that came out with phase 2. Majority of WoW player base never was tough enough for wpvp.
---
How would you even know? Ya'll don't speak the same language.
---
 " I also try to kill hunter pets before the hunter so it loses happiness. "  
---
Forgot about that !  
---
Good tip.

meanwhile on /r/wow:
---
&gt; Blizzard writing is so bad! Why would they force multiple factions when it's clear we should all be on one team!
---
Ooo okay, thank you!
---
Better than complaining all the time and doing nothing
---
Yes.
---
and everyone on pagle thinks vicious is bad lol. sorry this happened to you
---
We kick their ass until they bring a 60 and we run away*, at least in my past experience as one of those twinks.
---
Love how you thought me bitching would backfire, now its been heavily nerfed. Thanks for the help
---
I just quested with a "refugee" from one of the pvp servers. He left behind a 60 pala and druid. Apparently getting to BRD with his druid required 18 deaths so he figured it's faster to just reroll.
---
I am on a pvp server, I am still questing and I am loving it.
---
I definitely find the coa/corruption on adds to be quite a bit higher. Its good for those 100 parses
---
Quit crying you rolled on a pvp server! /s
---
Hahaha Shhhhhhh....
---
You chose this life.
---
Kill all 3.
---
Like that OP referred to him as male through the whole post?
---
He is healed now
---
For me it doesn't happen like that, I'm standing or even sitting eating and I'll command the pet to attack a target and I'll enter combat too the moment the damage is dealt.
---
I get that, but I hardly ever play with anyone outside my guild, and this one time I decide to, i do what i do in guild runs. we greed unless it was a legit upgrade.   
---
Not the end of the world, but just letting people know, they scummy.
---
&gt;I would like to note that at no time did I incite anyone to go after him.  I just want them to know what he did.
---
Shitter
---
Look at his comment history.
---
There’s a reason he is using a 10 day old account.
---
Some guy in my guild was complaining about getting ganked by a death squad repeatedly and someone else just kept saying “you need to get better” and “you’re just being outplayed”. It was really cringe listening to someone honestly say that they would’ve played it better and come out on top
---
Are those players not ashamed? I couldn't do this all day long it would just feel unfair and boring. Do those guys truly feel like they are beating someone in a fight?
---
ehh, not all guild use the bis raid comp. My guild has 5 druids for some ungodly reasons.
---
Caverns of time was lit
---
nothing wrong with that, i was just poking the dude as he lacked coherent thoughts.
---
gl with ott, we all have our kos targets
---
nah m8, you're an asshole
---
What would be a good place to farm gold for a Warlock? I keep seeing posts for warriors, rogues and mages but nothing really for warlocks.
---
Well asmongold and advertise dont try to hide or deny it. Its not much different from following a sports atar. And tbh its pretty entertaoning.
---
I've been talking to some horde that are 48+ and they cant quest anymore. Only takes 1 or 2 to camp you to ruin your time. Recieving honor for anything more than a 5 level cap is absurd to me.
---
Oh wow, they were in uncontested territories killing flagged players the other day?  
---
My experience has been horde parties camping flight paths to our boat towns where we're flagged by default every single day.  
---
At this point I don't take boats, which is a major hinderance. I either have to buy a portal or keep my hearth somewhere inconvenient in Kalimdor.
---
Feels good man
---
... why
---
Ironically they just care about the "honor" lol
---
It's not at all. Terminal-nerds in their 40s are going to mash out some eye-watering cringe in defence of it, tho. 
---
To maintain perspective, remember that these people LARP.
---
Death coil, fear, corruption, shadowburn, shadowbolt = dead
---
/laugh
---
Wowhead.
---
Everyone knew this going into classic. If you were a Druid YOU WERE GOING TO HEAL. That was it. It was well known and established. All these people thinking but I'm a dps paladin! No you're a benched paladin.
---
Check the wowhead realm populations. I think you will find out of pve, rp pvp and pvp horde is only ahead in just the pvp category by like 10% 
---
And if you look at all realms they are even in terms of horde/alliance dominated realm.
---
Points at Thorium point
---
Dude... the amount of merciless, unforeseen ganking in that game is insane. You're just doing a couple of your every day, low-sec gate jumps in your miner packed with minerals and a bunch of faction missiles to sell. You're not even paying attention really. Next thing you know, you're jump locked and targeted. You see three different missiles leave stealthed ships and they insta-kill you. Without even blinking, they are already locking onto your escape pod and you manage to jump right before the missile hits that destroys the countless weeks of training you for some reason did not decide to back up. 
---
Fuck Eve
---
I dont think anyone is having a good time if I'm being honest. Ita so boring being the dominant faction as well.
---
No pvp fights for hours and then you just stomp them. It's no fun at all.
---
Kurinaxx slaps. I love it. Feels real close to 50/50
---
bbut what about the dps meter
---
look at the other proc.
---
&gt; Whenever someone tells you that things change and we do stuff differently with time
---
$500 says that if you went back and checked out a Roman barracks there would be frequent displays of legionaries holding a pila between their legs saying "Hey, Fabius, look at how big my dick is."
---
There is a video somewhere posted about some hordes ganking goldshire inn while the horde runs in to rock music and the alliance are doing that stupid backpack dance.
---
I think a lot of people are drawn too this dark and edgy lifestyle of the horde and truly believe alliance are snowflake childs.
---
It's really cringy.
---
Can you imagine them in a real pvp game?
---
I genuinely keked
---
Only your friend rolled?
---
Just sounds dumb.
---
You can’t trinket a stun
---
Yeah, and I image that all of them are "walk across two zones / fly across the continent to get story exposition, the actual quest and 200 xp".
---
I wear Finkle's on Geddon, Rag, and all of the trash around Geddon/Shazz/Sulfuron. It's a good situational item.
---
DM E jump runs.
---
But honestly, it's just crap for what it costs. Like it's min/maxing to a complete extreme. The investment and reward aren't worth it. 
---
There is a good reason Sulfuras was only really seen on Enh Shaman in pvp.
---
Haha that's what makes the game fun though, without the risk the game would be quite boring.
---
only way pretty much anyone truly feels like they have won a fair fight, is  in a duel in front of a major city
---
I wasn’t really making serious commentary on the subject :p
---
People have been playing this game for 15 years and nothing has changed in that time. So the price of items is determined by basic supply/demand principles. Idk I’m high
---
Auctioneer addon
---
what? are you not doing dps? it offers no dps
---
They didn't originally have guards at the zeppelins until alli relentlessly attacked horde there during vanilla, in the days when alli outnumbered horde on most servers.
---
A ton do actually. Some reach out to me when I salute as they gank me. I would say anyone who is seriously aiming for pvp rank has 2 accounts.
---
You unfortunately answered your own question.
---
Sorry, I thought we were talking about for pve. it doesnt offer any dps stats.
---
I'm gonna gank a lowbie so he can be just as salty as you &lt;3
---
This made me laugh
---
ur lying
---
Well is there a disc build where I can at least win some 1v1s and also still heal dungeons?
---
Your chain of toxic &amp; salty comments in response to people voicing their opinions about your terrible ideas has been hilarious. Do me next!
---

The absolute butthurt on this sub every single day since Phase 2 started. lol

Ehh most of the quests feel copy pasted for the horde.

Currently farming ZF solo runs on my mage, and using my second monitor to browse reddit during ice block cooldown timer.  
---
I never said I wasn't a fan of asmongold otherwise I wouldn't be posting in his subreddit or even bother looking at these drama reddit posts. I am stating to you that I am not here to defend asmon because he is Asmon but to try and fight back against the waves of people who seem to have no problem defending and supporting someone who is clearly in the wrong and showing signs of an unhealthy obsession.  
---
I am not sure what you are trying to do going from calling me a white knight, then to "Why aren't you okay with being a fan of his?" when I claim I am not a white knight. If I see something I disagree with, I will argue against it. You can clearly see that with my post history since you are already scouring through it. I have nothing to hide friend nor am I trying to hide it.
---
Playing as Horde on Blaumeux (US) and while censuses say it's roughly 50/50, I swear it's alliance heavy.
---
Some fights are relatively even and I got into a good organic scrap in Felwood near jadefire run where 10-15 hordies were fighting 10-15 alliance, but overall I feel like I'm constantly getting flight path camped and ganked in any high level zone.
---
I basically stopped playing my 54 undead priest (with the exception of grinding dungeons) until battlegrounds release.  If the server truly is 50/50, then all the hordies must be off doing raids or something because world PvP feels dominated by Alliance.
---
Gotta find the right play style for you. I like hunter for PvP but despise it in PvE. I loved playing feral Druid in PvE but hated it in PvP. 
---
Love the idea of playing a mage but hate actually playing one. 
---
There’s soooo many things that go into what class you should play you just gotta play around until you figure it out. ALSO, watch some videos. When I couldn’t decide on a class I would basically fall asleep to guides on what class to pick before I went to bed 
---
IMO mages are the “best” class in the game with great damage and cc, free food and water, and portals. Also great farming class
---
Is that an actual path people take?
---
There is one that will help you survive a bit longer, that’s about it.
---
False, what dictates that is your max weapon skill, thats why getting the last 5 levels always feels like it takes forever when youre leveling a new weapon like say to 205 or something. Mob level doesnt matter one bit. You could easily get 1 level per hit on rats for example all the way up to 250 or something if youre max weapon skill is 300.
---
Man some of the old goon scam stories on gsf forums.... Any other game and they all would have been banned haha
---
I'm stoned. I was thinking of OEB.
---
RattleGang 💪🏻
---
try using /emotes
---
Agreed. In fact most people just move on to do something else or log for a bit. Just saying it's impractical af to assemble a group everytime you want to fly somewhere, especially if you're not a lifer that plays 8+ hours a day in mom's basement.
---
Approximately how long ago did all of this transpire?
---
About 24 hours ago a female human paladin with the Hand of Ragnaros showed up on Windseeker under the name of Lynnia and joined Diplo and Friends.
---
Warlock literally has the most popular one in Mara
---
Thanks I’ll try that!
---
It has to be another account taking the name. So this trick works if you have two accounts, otherwise you need a friend to help you.
---
Man you needed a different corp. Scam everyone and anything, but corp mates are off limits. Do that are you are done, even in goons
---
I wish we got enough staff and mageblades to satsify the casters to give one to a druid.
---
And it sets the ceiling lower so that they don't have to spend 1000+ hours chasing the best possible gear
---
You don't understand why I'm making the comparison if you're making that statement.
---
If it's on twitch, it's bullshit. The personalities. The rivalries. All of the drama. None of it is real.

The whole WoW Team was lowkey Nurfed at one point.

Apples and fucking bowling balls.

All the talents are visible to you. You just mouse over them and read what they do

Of course you did. You’re pathetic and can’t win a fight that isn’t 30v1.

Thanks haven’t tried that yet

Some people are just takers, don't let them abuse your general human kindness to this degree.  He's a dick for sure, but you guys let him be one.  Recognize the pattern, and be glad you encountered it first in a video game.
---
Sounds like someone’s mad about PvP on a PvP server
---
You can heal up to UBRS easily as Shadow/Disc if you have a healing set.
---
The answer is different depending on whether you're talking about "fair" 1v1s, solo open world PvP, group PvP or battlegrounds. 
---
For solo PvP:
---
In a straight up 1v1 SL warlock is unquestionably the strongest if they have the right pet out. Shadow priest is a close second, followed by rogue and elemental shaman.
---
The kings of solo open world PvP are rogues followed by hunters and mages. Honorable mention to druid. Open world is all about being able to choose good fights, get the initiation and escape bad situations. These classes have the best tools to do that. As good as warlocks and shadow priests are in 1v1s, they have zero mobility which hurts a lot in the open world. 
---
For group PvP the main thing is that warriors get way stronger and rogues way weaker. Warriors are very underwhelming as a solo PvP class, but completely broken in group settings with a healer behind them. Rogues are the exact opposite. They're squishy and very easy to kill if they can't disable a target. Obviously in PvP that's very bad.
---
For future content, Warlocks are the best scaling class in the game and have the best gear in the upcoming phases. Hunters and druids are the weakest scaling classes. For hunter it's because your pet will never get stronger and for druid it's because there's really no good PvP sets for them. Every other class is somewhere in between, and they all scale well for the most part
---
You realize you can say this exact same thing about alliance, right now, except they *are* being punished, as we speak.
---
Time to spread it around a little until.
---
Lol this is so stupid. There’s a billion factors. Some groups won’t kill the the first boss, others are going to down rag 1 shot. 
---
Or were you looking for answer like 78% of the way through.
---
Took me 2 weeks to farm enough arcane for lionheart (12 arcane/roughly 500g) during non peak hours. Out of those 2 weeks of veins I got exactly 1 blue sapphire. That was before honor system too. I'd say it's worth not having to worry about ganks, playing at non peak times, or going 20 min without a single node.
---
There's one thing that horde will never be able to take away from alliance players: their virginity.
---
If thats being a Boomer, then sign me up.
---
Post your evidence
---
Get off your bad horse. You should never equip the Onyxia key nor the UBRS key for resistance.
---
Blizz understand, that if they allow transfers, before BGs release, they would loose more ~~players~~ gankers, because suddenly thouse would have nothing else to do in their full T1 and other BiS. First month after phase 2 release would show, how many players of oppressed factions would really unsuscribe. If that number will be critical they would open transfers, returning thouse who lost hope of getting any open world content into the game, while overcrowding PvE servers. 
---
That may lead to many PvP servers becoming PvE de-facto as faction in minority would completely abandon em, forcing ex gankers to focus on BGs, where they would be farmed by premades at some point.
---
We do this every week. I fury/prot tank garr and our prot tanks all adds. It's really easy. 
---
Have prot tank pull--if you have engi shield, use that. Throw dynamite, then just do normal threat. We tank them separate, then when garr is around 50% we stack them all for cleave/aoe. 
---
Keep demo shout up. It really isn't that bad if you have the gear and a couple of dedicated healers on you.
---
Rogues level fast and easy, get the strongest main hand dmg weapon you can get for you level (or close to it), go combat spec, spam sinister strike.  Mobs die fast.  Riposte at lvl 20 is a 10 energy sinister strike that isn't affected by global cooldown.  Blade flurry at lvl 30 will allow you to kill 2 mobs at once every 2 mins (super strong when you consider how many hours and mob kills the journey to 60 takes).  Orc you'll need to bandage frequently, and stop to eat at times.  Could reroll undead for cannibalize to boost leveling speed, I **very rarely** had to eat while leveling, bandage and cannibalize combo is effective to 60.    
---
Anyway rogues can be ez mode leveling and stealth is totally tits.
---
You need imp gouge
---
Pretty sure this rogue was just completely clueless about how to play and just did random shit. Either that or it was some next level griefing where he intentionally did a lot of really stupid delay shit.
---
It’s at 420 likes, don’t fucking ruin it

Phase 2 is just a bunch of mediocre Horde players wanting to be PvP gods standing in a circle with hands on each others’ dicks zug zugging each other off and when a lone Alliance arrives at the flight path, they kill him and then climax and just scream Lok’tar and For the Horde! 
---
The one thing I will say is that it is nice that the Horde has some faction pride, even if some of that goes to their head. I see a lot on here that “the Alliance are pussies and don’t fight back.” Which imo is pretty true, even in scenarios where it’s safe for them too. (The argument there is that any time you fight back and win, Horde *always* calls for back-up when they can. So you have to leave the area after a win if you’re Alliance.) so maybe Horde are the pussies that can’t deal with losing a fair fight, heh.

Substitute the “N” word for the “F” word and then see if you understand why the ban exists. If they are too stupid to realise that F is the new N in 2019 then they deserve their ban.
---
Context is irrelevant, the slur was used. Period.
---
Don’t blame me, blame the woke left, they are the ones who think words hurt more than bullets.
---
Right I fully agree. But one user was describing what someone said to him in game and it appears he got a perm ban for it. He said someone said something about the horde being “f*****ts”. That isn’t hate speech. It’s uttering an offensive word but it wasn’t used in an offensive way. Unless the mods here simply do not want to have words used regardless of how then I simply ask that a list of naughty words that can never be said be added. Why is cun* not bannable for example but the other word is? I am a woman and that word offends me greatly. I will send the mods a link to this then. I attempted to discuss this with one before and he was a condescending jerk but every other mod I have talked to was respectful. 
---
as I said above do not mistake my post for someone being unhappy they can not insult people. I am glad that rule is in place to keep this place civil but I simply ask if certain words are off limits what is the harm in making a list of them then so we know rather than banning first?
---
This 100% lol. PVP servers are not playable as intended for Alliance.
---
It is.
---
3% contribution point penalty and increased standing decay, and 1% gold drop, vendor price and xp penalty for each point over 55% of a server until people self deport and balance.
---
People are intentionally exacerbating the disparities to increase their advantage and reduce their risk - time to put a cost to rolling ez mode.
---
He's proud of himself, but wants to be modest about it
---
Stalagg or Skeram?
---
It's the same here. Already got camped by dead squads and ganked a lot. But yeah, I've chosen a pvp server. I just go somewhere else or log off if pvp gets too much.
---
Asmon really does not think this through at all. All this does it create a massive come back stream for advertise. I for one will be watching
---
r/gamingcirclejerk
---
Coordinate with your group, healing priest are needed in pvp just don't go in alone.
---
Also NTA.
---
Warrior is good fun. You never need to look for a tank, you can go arms or fury to do good damage while you tank, and stance dancing makes the class really interesting.
---
What?  Get a high dmg weap and spam sinister strike.  Shits ez mode from like lvl 15 or whenever you can buy your first blue weapon.
---
The same type of people play WoW. Both factions have the same type of people.
---
But a lot of posters in this sub are too stupid to realize this and act like one faction attracts all the superior morally righteous players and the other attracts scumbags
---
Like no both factions attract WoW players, maybe you just have an issue with the whole player base? Nobody here calls out their own faction just "aww he started it!"
---
Ikr!?  Let's get out of here before he thinks we're a space alien
---
Unfortunately not an option on my server
---
15 years of lore rape. They're absolutely right in the current context of WoW.
---
I killed him on my Ele just doing the hug routine. No mana pots needed, but more use of flame shock. One thing I'd like to see is if an Ele can actually kill the final guy. I watched a spriest do it, obviously sw:p is a much better dot, but its that mana drain poison that really gets you even with poison cleansing. I only tried once though, I'll have to try it again.
---
We always called it ”ghosting” 🤔 Even back in GoldenEye/PD times :p
---
I was horde on a 55/65 server, back when horde was minority. 
---
Anything past that starts getting bad, at 60/40 you start getting a feedback loop that pushes towards dead faction servers.

Flattered, but American. Gobbless

---
*laughs in Normal sever
---
you just dont know how to pvp. Take warlock for example, your pet's spell pushback doesnt let them easily cast spells, meaning that they cant get a fear off for free, also if youre BM, you literally win for free. use intimidate then Bestial Wrath = dead warlock. if you arent BM then you simply FD 1 fear, scatter shot the other, they arent going to get a third one off because they should be dead by then. Warlock is one of the easiest fights you have as a hunter in fact.
---
This subreddit has taken a sharp turn in the last couple days lol.
---
Check out his post on this sub from 3 days ago lmao
---
idk if someone mentioned this yet or not but ony is immune to fire, making searing pain worthless
---
he held aggro due to boss mechanics + warlock not having a lick of threat reduction + prob no shaman tranq air totem. any decent warlock knows its one of the easiest things in the game to pull threat on ony lol
---
This. 29 is the easiest to level to with both AB and WSG and the cost and farming of the gear is easier than making a 39 twink. Level 19 twinks only get wsg. Love AB myself.
---
First off
---
EVERYONE ALWAYS ROLLS NEED ON A BOE EPIC TO ENSURE NO ONE NINJAS IT
---
And second, don't post names, look at rule number 3:
---
"No witch hunts or brigading. Don’t encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community. Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light."
---
TIP: whenever a rogue ganks you when you are at half health fighting a mob, try to finish off the mob first so you don't get durability loss
---
Always kill the hunter pets first. Even if you let the hunter free
---
I’m not making it political, I’m merely commenting on why using that word resulted in a ban. Like it or not it is a political issue. The politics of the west are such that the word used is protected as “hate speech”.  Other words that describe a persons genitals are not. 
---
The context is totally irrelevant. Not understanding that this IS political is your friend’s downfall. 
---
Educate yourself, it’s 2019. You have no excuse. It’s simple, never ever use a word in an online platform that can be considered “hate speech” as hate speech trumps free speech every time now and to continue to use it will see you deplatformed.
---
You could join his guild, but I heard he has super aids (maybe able to transmit over internet) so I would wear a condom.
---
I'm the GM of Diplo and Friends. After reading this it's answered a lot of our questions about how he was able to grab a hammer, and leave a server so easily. It also explains his friend's coming over to our server too.
---
I'd love to have a conversation with some people from The Scarlet Dawn and/or Pagle about this Vannessa, now known as Lynnia on Windseeker.
---
Tmugsy is streaming now at least. It's been pretty cool.
---
well, as long as your locks pvp its great they are getting a lot of t1. its BiS for pvp and just amazing in general/compared to other pvp gear.
---
can always sell the bracers/belts too, i think on our server bracers go for around 300-350 and belt around 450-500
---
it is not perma camped by alliance in fact horde are camping brm right now
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Adding that to my next "what to expect with classic+" YouTube video. Smash that bell
---
Big Wowie when they have FPs connecting them. You're acting like Horde can't travel between their capitals.
---
He was griefing Asmon, and using proxy stream-snipers.
---
this is true im on earthfury and horde and alliance is equal from what i can tell in fact brm is camped by horde right now
---
No. And also no.
---
Our guild has only seen one in 2 months of raiding. And 0 Sulfuron Ingots
---
only with BRE, else go dual wield. every time.
---
can vouch, this man tanks ony more than our warriors. if anyone knows exactly how to do it, its him LOL
---
i'm also pretty sure it isn't by choice, he just does so much damage no tank has a chance in hell to keep higher threat than him....check his logs if you want proof.
---
But you wont even be flagged coming to org because I camped that spot myself as ally and half the people jumping down aren't even flagged
---
Yeah I meant skinning.
---
He meant for feral dps and he was right. There's the str bracers, Accuria ring and ony neck for us and that's it.
---
I play Fury 2h slam spec, and I got BRE on my second Raggy. This spec isn't optimal,but I am close to dw warriors,so everyone is ok with it. Plus,the queue for 1h swords is clogged af,so getting a 2h helps both the player and the raid.
---
If you don't like classic, retail exists.
---
It is a permaban ofc!
---
Warriors are incredibly fun in pvp with stance dancing, decently fun in dungeons (which you can get into super easy as a warrior), and mindnumbing to play in solo pve. I have had more fun on my warrior, gameplay wise, than any other class by far in WoW, so if you're after intense rewarding moments I would suggest them but I'm not going to lie to you: Outside of stance dancing for situational abilities, warriors don't really have a 'rotation', you just autoattack things until you have enough rage to cast your 1 rage dump ability (heroic strike for 1-40, mortal strike for 40-60). Since almost no mobs have abilities that require you to swap, be prepared to just hit stuff and wait patiently to press one single button when grinding.
---
Perfect post. This is what the subreddit has become
---
No multiboxing is not against anything and they're free to do as they please because they pay a sub for each character, they've been doing it for a very long time and it doesn't break any rules
---
&gt;Other option is get a lot of guides to mass report your name, also free name change.
---
comes with a 24 hour ban sometimes.  happened to a guy i know.
---
It seems strange that they can’t copy it and instead just remove a chunk of chat.
---
Where's any proof of him doing that? It's pretty easy to locate the most popular player on the server at any given time.
---
That’s what I figured, but it removed mine and the general chat as well
---
Or we can make classic less bad.
---
Population doesn't lead people to be ass hats though. I've always been a pvp guy but I don't kill lowbies and I don't camp flight paths. Actually, I've never pvped for the honor grind or to gain anything, I pvp because it's fun. What these folks are doing is not fun. I don't see how it could be fun. I'm just gonna blame zoomers being sociopaths.
---
yes, the previous GM personally. not the guild though, they did not agree or even know about any loans
---
This. But people like to think they have somehow our theorycrafted a 15 year old game.
---
Personally I would take points in camouflage instead of master of deception. And as pointed out before you really want improved gouge.
---
You're an idiot.it is so easy to get to tram stealthed.even then there are zero guards in tram.Also tram is only from IF and SW.No one needs that anymore other than the first time.If and SW are on the same CONTINENT.you are actually dumb for saying this.
---
What servers were on offer to transfer from your server? That'll help us narrow down where they went.
---
1. Don't even try accusing a successful tank as giving 'awful advice'. I've tanked pretty much everything up to Heroic ICC in wotlk and rolled warrior for Classic as well. I quit alongside 3/4 of subscribers are cataclysm release, because Blizzard made the game too easy/boring.
---
2. If you want to prove a point, go by actual ingame mechanics and not a wiki. Wiki and class guides are always "easiest to use, not best for results" scenarios. With the raid debuff limit at 30, you don't go deep enough into arms for stance dancing, you only get the parry so you *must* dump your rage before switching to defensive stance. Thunderclap does that - and causes the most multi-mob threat.
---
3. I said macro cleave to your *instant* skills e.g sunder, shield slam. This way you will always *use* sunder, shield slam etc BEFORE cleaving. If you don't have enough rage to do both, you will still sunder/SS and fail to cleave. My advice is not wrong.
---
As for your whirlwind advice, it's plain bad. Try that in LBRS/UBRS in all dps gear and you can easily get instagibbed by 3 or more lucky crits as soon as you pull. 
---
As for your argument of "wasting globals" over SS/Revenge etc.... you are just derailing with that argument. Nobody said to cast Demo/TC more than once, just to use it as an Opener since you have the rage to do so and frontload some threat.
---
I need to see this please
---
This is actually a strategy. Catching people at 1/2 health with no buffs is easiest to kill.
---
I know that makes a difference, but I still think the difference in guards is the bigger factor.
---
Easy to spot people like this guy who didn't play classic, or TBC for that matter.
---
This is always how it was until sharding tried to balance the factions within a zone.
---
Multiboxing is totally within the rules as long as they aren't botting.
---
Ok so who volunteers to count? ^^
---
alliance salty tears, tasty.
---
Damn, I’m gonna hit the guild up that was doing it, maybe I can get my alt into one of these groups to level while I’m at work.
---
People saying pvp happens just want all the complaint posts to stop whining about everything.
---
This isnt gonna be like vanilla WOW more people are intrested and ofc early phase 2 is gonna be crazy.
---
What annoys me the most is all the complaining when there were solutions to the problems like not rolling on the big servers or transferring when you got the chance
---
I've always enjoyed wpvp and the risk involved in going out into the wild. Also battles back and forth in Hilsbrad. Whatever this is, this is something different. Some people are complaining about standard shit, but this flight path camping and roving marauders in searing gorge are ridiculous.
---
this has probably already been mentioned but it comes down to a couple of things, mostly skill and info/resources
---
first off, warrior isn't an easy class to play well let alone at a high level. it takes time, effort and learning/practice. 
---
second off, there is a lot of complicated/weird shit about warriors like unique builds, IE fury/prot DW tanking with "threat generating" gear instead of your stereotypical "mitigation armor defense dodge" gear is the current "meta" because the threat generation is so high (and it has to be, because DPS is so high now....unless your DPS sucks, then it isn't a problem), and current bosses don't do much damage, making the need for a beefy warrior with mitigation gear and a sword n board more or less useless (there still are times when they wanna use sword/board and mitigation gear though)  
---
on top of all that, warriors, esp fury tanks/dps are very gear dependent. if you don't have full pre-raid BiS you probably won't do much for damage compared to others that do. And then once you start getting some of your BiS raiding gear you'll really see a spike. Some of our best geared warriors are pushing 1.3k+ DPS and i don't even think they are fully BiS'd yet
---
join the warrior "fight club" discord (gotta google it i dont have link), they should be able to help you out with any questions and im sure they have resources on what the best spec/rotation/gear etc is for everything.
---
TL;DR if you see a deep prot warrior with a sword and board just run the other way LOL
---
1 on 1 in BRM
---
:0, monster!
---
4 playable factions there, and factions dont even matter
---
is the sword worth 300g? i personally don't think so, seeing how you have a few options for weapons pre-MC
---
is it worth for you? well, that depends. how long does it take you to farm 300g? is that longer than it would take you to get the other weapons? don't forget crusader enchant. 
---
its not a bad sword by any means, i just personally couldnt see myself buying it with the other options available, at least for more than 200g.
---
I mean if were throwing that in, I just can't believe he got to 63 without learning any new abilities as a paladin. Obviously no talents is feasible but I'm sorry that's just unbelievable lol. To see every other players not only riding mounts but just using abilities and to never even wonder how to do that yourself... nah.
---
I do it on lava packs sometimes. It's saved my ass as a priest on back to back Fire Blossoms a few times
---
I thought this was r/destinycirclejerk for a second lol
---
We don't think it's harassment. If you don't want people to gank you don't post where your character is online in real time.
---
i think krol/mirahs dual wield will beat your dps. so you should let other warrios get BRE, thats huge. i passed also on hand of rag bcuz its only good in pvp.
---
I played when people still did raids to farm gear in Strat. You are a clown if you think most people farmed honor all day in classic. Most people raided and did dungeons all day, because not many people know what was bis, and raids took 2-3x as long as they do now.
---
Also, world PVP was really only a thing for a month or so until BG's came out. There wasn't enough time for people to figure out how good engineering was, or the best places to camp ( like we do know 15 years later).
---
Again, you are a clown.
---
You can hear his stream in the background lmao
---
Like i said, i was just wondering why people did it instead of getting actual honor. I have learned that there are way to legit dispel the honorless buff for some reason, so its actually a smart way to do it. If I wanted to go make friendship bracelets with the horde id go on a pve server, no thanks
---
Ok, how about looking at it from a different point of view. Do you enjoy PVP? Do you realise that the toxic behaviour you're describing above will kill PVP (the outnumbered faction will leave or stop playing)? Will you still play with no pvp, and probably even no BGs as the server will be so imbalanced you'll need to queue for hours... If you enjoy playing the game then it seems logical to not do the thing which will kill it?
---
You care enough to post here looser
---
Roflmao, /cheer and keep riding,I don't kill gray targets. Also,they might be bait for people to stop,Hordes are cunning like that.
---
I will be honest. I got banned on my WoW gamer reddit account for a week because I described a situation where someone in game harassed me. I simply repeated the words that were used to me as I shared my story of playing WoW as a “girl gamer” in the thread. I was furious. This was a month ago but I did not want to post on that account for obvious reasons and I keep it separate from this one as it contains my in game username. I see the same thing happening time and time again such as with the bread person I referenced above. I have not messaged him yet but I will after this to see if he did get a permanent ban or what. 
---
My request for the list was because I personally would have never used those words if I knew saying it was forbidden entirely. I understand if you do not believe me but I am being honest here. I just wanted to share a vile story followed by an uplifting one with another WoW player on here that day and I got banned for literally sharing my experience. Thank you for your replies and for being nice. 
---
ps I did not post here to escape a ban if someone thinks that. my one week suspension on my WoW sub account ended three weeks ago. I stream and I do not want to be harassed there for posting my complaint here.
---
If you leveled on an 80 20 server instead of a 20 80 server, that's your choice. Can't fix stupid.
---
Picking high pop servers hmmmmm
---
Not transfering hmmmmmm
---
It's kinda their own fault tbh
---
Hope he joins Method
---
A spec that is countered by a trinket on a 5 min CD is not the best
---
  This is my main problem  there is proof  of Asmon saying, because he is big a Twitch streamer RULES apply different to him  THEN turns around and says "your breaking Twitch TOS, ban him "
---
Why is this getting down voted?
---
Those are some awful awful players.
---
It can also turn on a dime once another outgroup is introduced. These same players at each others' throats will happily band together to attack players from other MMOs (including retail WoW).
---
Much horde. So skill.
---
Why? Do you kill people 10 levels below you? What do you get out of it? What about it brings you pleasure?
---
Thankfully I started playing WoW 80 years ago so I’m a few levels highers

Hi, /u/Eazy_E28

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e2u06p/so_i_asked_blizzard_for_a_birthday_gift/). 
---
But in BGs you have an equal amount of enemies, so people like that are out
---
Wrong. You think only good people join alliance and bad people join horde? Are you a child? Because that's a childlike mentality.
---
Oooh, it gets better!
---
That's why smart folks knew classic was a bad idea. This is how the game was. In TBC even there were multiple times I just logged out because I couldn't play due to world pvp. Even in BGs, the total population is fixed, but zerging different nodes is the strategy.
---
"Overwhelming numbers is pvp" - some guy 15 years ago, still true
---
Lol nice
---
Well... Yes. That’s what all of us had to do in vanilla. I started out on a PvP server and got fed up when reaching STV. Many of us on Normal servers said this would happen.
---
I'm not sure, and trying to track him down would be a witch hunt, so I just want what transpired to be known.  No harassment, etc.
---
Druids and Shamans were obviously going to be healers since they were healers in Everquest, but Paladins were a tank class in Everquest. They got totally shafted in vanilla.
---
With that in mind, it's pretty funny that Druid tanks ended up better than Paladin tanks in Classic.
---
Yeah after p3 you will, gz
---
If you try to tell me that the Forsaken were at one time not edgy, then you’re either an idiot or a liar. And I don’t think you’re an idiot.
---
This seems to be the best way I've done it on my attempts so far.  I have mostly blues and was able to kill the pet but went oom and was unable to kill the demon.  I can see that summoning her at her patrol spot close to the lake is of utmost importance, because if you don't then you are having to kite 2 level 60 elites through a minefield of mobs.  Also important to think about is that you can't just rely on jumpshotting your arcane shots.  You have to drop in as many autoshots as you can to conserve mana.

Make sure you use stone skin on the imps. They wont do any dmg.

This is why earlier mmo's had consequences for bad behavior. In UO originally there was a reputation system that kept you out of cities if you got too dastardly. Later on it was replaced by the murderer system but the result was the same. Kill too many folks and you can't go into town anymore, you're an outcast and KOS for any law abiding citizens. In wow unfortunately there are no consequences for being a douche.
---
After spending Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK as Horde I am looking forward to having the AV bridge in Classic as Alliance.
---
rogues might just be the least helpful class in pve
---
Someone get this to the Clinton foundation!
---
youre not kidding

They were so bad it's amazing....

The VERY VIDEO where he tries to show he wasn't targetting Asmon, his proxy stream-snipers whisper him they have found Asmon.
---
You can hem and haw all you like, but Advertise has been investigated now for many days, this isn't some off the cuff response by Twitch.
---
The only problem with this is the game was super fun during phase 1. I think BGs will vastly improve the game.
---
I've stopped playing

And if you don't let us fuck this asshole then all our dicks and pussies will be covered in shit!

I went with Puptrash.

I only get to look at reddit for a few minutes a day thanks to having a wife and kids. Id love a chance to see more memes since my time is limited.
---
yeah he was the only one that needed it
---
Looks like there might be a happy ending after all
---
Anyone aiming for PVP Rank probably doesn’t have time for second accounts unless they’re sharing
---
Nah it’s bugged. My guild has gotten an Onyxia ID+lockout from clearing the 3 trash mobs before her. As in, we were ready to pull her and could check our raid ID. 
---
I haven’t seen this happen in MC (nor have I bothered to check since we full clear every week and I’m busy raiding so I don’t check the raid tab), but I wouldn’t be surprised if this bug can happen in MC. It is a valid concern.
---
They work, special bandages are basically discounted bandages only usable in BGs, their purpose is to not spend too much gold on consumables
---
Epstein didn't kill himself, his healers forgot to watch his health
---
If you're playing in 2019 and expected the same experience as 2004 then I don't know what to tell you.
---
You can't get first aid above 225 before level 35 either. But you can get 225 before 20
---
Rogue has a ton of panic buttons that keep you safe while leveling. Gouge. Blind. Dodge. Potions. Bandages.  And if it’s that bad either vanish or dash. 
---
This can help you do quests you shouldn’t be doing yet. Minus the poisons quest. That just sucks. It’s not long or challenging, just too much for the level you get it at. Bring help. 
---
 Gougespam plus slow poison offhand can keep you safe until your bandage or potion comes off cool down.   Starts to come online 10-20 and just gets better from there. 
---
Idk that the melee is super interesting. Spam sinister strike. Eviscerate or slice and dice. Kick casts. Repeat forever.  You can make it a little more interesting with riposte, or backstab, or engineering.  What’s interesting about the class is staying alive, and picking your fights and tools for the job you want.
---
Dire Maul courtyard door
---
I mean twinking at 49 still has its own BG bracket, and I too have to prevent exp gain so im not sure what you're trying to tell me regarding that fact. One of the earliest twinks I remeber was a level 1 and he stacked Dodge% and was over 100% dodge and could kill pretty much any melee class.
---
2 point snd lasts like forever with improved snd (which you should have for raiding)  there is like no reason not to have it up
---
K so rankers will just go back to ganking like they’re currently doing after they hit their “BG time” cap. This idea wad terroble the last 50 times it was suggested and will stay just as terrible for the next 50 ones.
---
Come to rattlegore and run to BRM.  You’ll see

I bought one of these off a guildie for 25g... I've just been flipping the essences for quick cash.

Well worth.
---
My proudest moment was in Feralas on my then level 45 human paladin. A 46 orc warrior was there fighting ogres, and at one point I saw him fighting two mobs at once but let him be. He repaid the favor by charging me after I finished up killing an ogre myself. We fought, but I came out on top after a very close fight!
---
Typically means it's a post about the sub.
---
Can confirm I am 30 in a couple of months and grew up playing that shit.
---
Twitch is bad in general.
---
This zerg style of PvP has always been around. It's literally how Tarren Mill vs. Southshore was born. (It was also on Rallos Zek once upon a time.)
---
The difference now is the populations on high-profile realms. Large groups of players organizing ended up designating specific realms for one faction. That sort of "mob" organization wasn't around for Vanilla.
---
Try shadow priest. 1 bis forever item you actually get a chance at in MC and Ony.
---
Fellow pagleite, one of the few on horde side. Hate to see it for you guys :(
---
horde fag lol
---
Dude, I never thought of that.. In world PvP situations,  a priest can literally Mind Control a lock &gt; Hellfire him to death.
---
One gank on the way to BRM and that's all she wrote. Personally I don't think world buffs are necessary unless you really want to flex your Dpeen on warcraftlogs.com. If everyone brings elixirs and food buffs, you should still be able to clear MC in less than 1.5 hours.
---
[Getting a little hard to breathe in this sub lately.](https://youtu.be/3KquFZYi6L0)
---
Thank you for your insightful and constructive perspective.
---
Yeah, gonna have to agree here. It's not a matter of making another game of thrones, it's a question of why game of thrones wasn't a 2 part film. It's because you simply can't get all that story telling into 2 movies.
---
Warcraft's tale needs far more than just 2 hours (or even 4 if it's a 2-part film) to tell us all and to develop characters well. Despite that though, I loved the movie and watched it three times in the cinema :p
---
Lol. That third face cracked me up. Thank you
---
Its my understanding that bshout is 50 threat to each target PER person/pet buffed. .. and not that the threat is split amongst targets.
---
That's only for the Horde though, Alliance 225-300 is in Theramore Isle
---
There is no meaningful difference between 8 weapon skill and more than 8, beyond that weapon skill is a wasted stat on a warrior. There is a meaningful difference between 5 weapon skill and 8 weapon skill, because of the difference in glancing blow damage. There will be times when going for other stats will be more valuable than closing the gap between 5 and 8 weapon skill, and times when it might be slightly better to get to 8 weapon skill.
---
Judging that is not always easy, and the "stop at 5" rule is not really any better than relying on the spreadsheet. It's possible the spreadsheet is overvaluing the stat, in which case it goes from slightly better to slightly worse. It doesn't flip between being much better and much worse. The difference is not dramatic either way.
---
Here are some of those times:
---
If you get C'Thun's dagger, Death's Sting, it has +3 dagger skill and is amazing with ACLG.
---
If you *don't* have the Onslaught Girdle, and you use 2 daggers, then you *certainly* want Mugger's Belt (which has +5 skill and +1% crit) because that 3 weapon skill (or 5, doesn't matter) really is more valuable than 15 strength (Omokk's). That belt along with the ACLG will let you use any two best daggers you can find, until you get Death's Sting.
---
The hidden fact in the OP is that the alternative is BIS gear, so it's comparing Mugger's Belt to Onslaught Girdle and saying that you *might* want to keep the amazing Onslaught Girdle for now and can sacrifice a bit in terms of your offhand dagger, on alliance, to get the glancing blow improvement (or let someone else take CHT). The reality is that most people have situational access to raid gear, so you should probably just equip the CHT or the Onslaught Girdle, whichever you get first, and gear around that, if you're going daggers.
---
One plus to the distracting dagger is that you can make the argument that you need the Onslaught Girdle (and be nice enough to need only one of two really good daggers in Molten Core, between Perd's and CHT), and you have a very clean upgrade path in p5 to the Death's Sting dagger. Given that the difference is already only slight, you can also get an offhand before then (Dragonfang in BWL or Fang of the Faceless in ZG).
---
This sounds very similar what happened to &lt;Nomads&gt; with a ret pally taking the Eye of Sulfuras then quitting the guild. At least they didn't server transfer like Vanessa did.  
---
Sorry about what happened to you guys of Scarlet Dawn. This is a prime example of why server transfers shouldn't still be going on. Great job to those on Windseeker to finding out their new identity!  
---
Parabellum of Tilted Gryphons stands with you during these trying times.
---
ok so its a question of duration then? what specifically is the cutoff for acceptable vs bannable
---
/pat 
---
/cast hellfire
---
Nobody who has read ancient Roman graffiti would take you up on that bet.
---
Streamers are trying to make money from their stream.
---
&gt;They explain away what they can't understand or comprehend with insults and ad hominem. I didn't straw man. 
---
That's what you're doing though. You just pretend like you're not guilty of it.
---
Since you didnt specificy anything, then I suggest the french server Auberdine.
---
Virgin
---
Thanks, this was my best guess. I think I will start without the FR as am most worried about dying before Garr dies.
---
Yeah I can see why someone would summon themselves in another scenario, but this warlock is a bit silly summoning himself. Why would anyone request that?
---
Just stand next to the guy that teleports you, then log off.
---
when you are doing MC log in, get invited and jump out the window, this will teleport you into the instance.
---
I have little time to play this game because I got two special need kids.
---
Can I still get a pvp title on a PVE server? I probably will take more than a year and never get decent gear. Will I just be slaughtered in a battleground?
---
You're right! NA
---
Objectively the warning signs were there from the start. After all these years if someone is maining a ret pally in raids they're unequivocally a very selfish person, definitely not a team player. From a decision makers stand point they're a cancer I would avoid at all costs. To let someone like that be in a position of power over a group of people is just asking for trouble. Repaying the debt is the right thing, what a shitty burden he left you with. Hopefully your story serves as a reminder to the rest of the classic community that by in large people who play Paladin's and don't heal are people you should just avoid. If the GM of your raiding guild is a ret pally or enhance shaman gtfo out now, they're just using you for the hand of rag.
---
Agreed. I've never read LotR but from what I recall apparently they STILL cut some stuff that was in the novel anyway (and despite that, each movie was STILL four hours long (the director's cut, with EVERY scene included)).
---
That isn’t what exponentially means. 
---
Also it’s very likely that the above explanation was just how it was designed. Back in the day, it’s very likely that Blizzard handcrafted every mob. More different mobs would just add more work to an already extremely rushed launch.
---
Thanks, this is more or less what I how I pictured it would go. I just would hate to have missed one key detail and die. Wiping on a boss you kill trivially (although more slowly than I would like) is a good way to never try that strategy ever again...
---
If watching twitch is against the twitch tos, perhaps the government should close twitch down.
---
That's just how desperate we are for HKs over here. It's ok, though, BGs are less than 2 weeks away now.
---
Cant. Fucking. Wait. Popcorn ready and my god damn sides are in space. Whats the problem Horde? Not getting enough pvp on a pvp server? Yeah that sounds like it sucks. Oh me? Just you know, instant queueing into wsg for some 10 on 10 fights.
---
Okay see ya next phase
---
yeah ur white knighting pretty hard man
---
u got an asmonboner
---
because a HOMELESS person would not be paying $15 / month for a game
---
These characters aren’t looting it.
---
To be fair, apparently they were still engaging in this behavior even BEFORE the honor system dropped :p
---
(I'm on a PvE server, so I only have what others have to say on the matter)
---
Wow, you live that long?
---
Paladins have a "Protection" talent tree, class enchants from ZG that give defense bonus, armor trinket from Dire Maul, etc... 
---
Blizzard definitely intended for Paladins to be tanks, but half-assed it because they wanted Paladins and Shaman to be "equal".
---
You can totally expect one similar in spirit but that's not what Blizzard have delivered. Allowing massive servers and then opening nonfaction specific transfers is part of why the game doesn't feel like vanilla.
---
&gt; Asmongold LITERALLY RAISED ADVERTISE while he was creating anti-Asmongold content
---
that eminem line about turning a molehill into a mountain or whatever sure is relevant
---
Oh jesus, every guild has one of these PVP Gods who "would have just fear bombed them off and then intercept/MS two shot and dead boom, just snare and kite man what are you doing you just suck."  
---
Then you see this kid in real pvp and he's keyboard turning.
---
BShout is ~50 threat to every incombat target, PER friendly target you buff with it.. so 5 party members +1 pet = 300 threat to every target.
---
Damn, when you realized you were being called out for your 5th grade reading level you immediately defaulted to calling people pussies and cunts?
---
That's a good look, a child's temperamant to go with your GED.
---
Are pve realms actually dead though? Feels like you could just be leveling and actually out in the world, you know, playing the game.
---
Last I checked plants don’t use the combat log.
---
Only when Mom lets him use the Internet

his stream persona is an act, undeniably. you can argue over whether or not it is based in authenticity, but you cant argue that it is dramatized for the viewers.
---
I dont even play classic at the moment but these stories are always juicy as fuck. Same with the "guildmasters girlfriend gets all the loot and cybers with main tank" - kinda stories
---
Lets hope this Vanessa-person gets kicked out that new guild on windrunner lol.

Probably. I play on it too.
---
It’s really unfairbanks. 
---
Jokes aside it sucks
---
The protection tree was centered around getting critical strikes. Didn't provide sufficient threat generation or methods of dealing with tanking. Like you know A GOD DAMN TAUNT! They didn't have one. No fear immunities, a bubble that was worthless as a tank. They were god awful tanks. For fucks sake most tanks weren't very much in Prot anyway. They were mostly Holy/Ret back in the day. Since Prot offered next to no threat, which was what they failed at most of all.
---
You could always xfer, carebear
---
projection much? Giving a group member water/food will help the group thus also help me. If you dont see the distiction then thats your shortcoming.
---
Blizzard did their part in releasing the servers in the same state as patch. 1.12. Faction imbalance was always there, along with the other imbalances of Vanilla. They gave us the servers for Vanilla, the way we played the game is what makes it feel like it's not Vanilla. I'm still having fun but I know it's not the same as before, that's just not possible. People are going to play like min/maxers regardless of faction balance. 
---
That being said, the massive servers are totally at fault of Blizzard. Vanilla was never as crowded as Classic is and I think that is the main cause of many problems people are having today. At this point the best they can do is allow server transfers but the faction imbalance will always be there.
---
 Problem is there are no guards at all for alliance boats, while horde zeppelins sit right outside your major cities with elite guards. Boat from wetlands to theramore is always camped by 15 hordes. Have you died on the boat? Yeah, if you dont make it back in time you'll just respawn on the boat. Standing on 15 hordes.
---
Blizzard should definately add more guards to alliance towns and hubs. The reason horde has so many is because alliance was more in vanilla, forcing blizzard to add more guards to horde to make the game playable. The roles are reversed now. And nO cHaNgEs is not an excuse.
---
Good use of macros clears your space up enormously. You can have all 4 weapon buffs on one button with modifier macro.
---
You can also have a heal or lightning macro depending on what you are targeting, also for chain heal and lightning. You can get a totem add on which gives you 5 interchangeable binds for your totems, then you bind tremor, grouding, earthbind seperately to this. Plenty of ways to minimise the clutter!
---
Such is life
---
downside though is at this phase of the game, a warrior w/ sulfras will be lucky to see a high 300 white hit on a priest that is doing 300dmg w/ dots and then over 1000 dmg non-crit mindblast in MC lvl gear
---
really feels like sulfras should have 3-4 more dps and 20 or so more strength
---
the proc alone on it isnt really enough to give it legendary status
---
Miles below? Umm, yeah. Why? If I put those two items into 60 upgrades with my EP, Lionheart is 133 points and Judgement is 128 points. Considering the hit on Lionheart is often wasted (eg if the wsg leggings release next month, onslaught + sentinel + lionheart already overcaps you), Lionheart ends up below Judgement. 32 Spelldmg and 23 Int are a lot better than 1 Str and 2% crit.
---
He said "Druid who doesn't want to heal" and "feral" Feral is bear &amp; cat, you don't just do one or you're not doing it correctly. Bears are excellent tanks for some fights and for others its better to go cat, a lot of the BiS gear (Especially later) is shared between cat &amp; bear, all the more encouraging a dual role.
---
With that being said, if you're talking about JUST cat, you still missed Quick strike ring, and pvp gear is still relevant, even if you plan on pvping as feral (such as finkles lava dredger)
---
Horde players are predominantly more die-hard on my server, like we're fairly balanced (Mograine EU) most predictions put us about about 40-60 but in 3am-8am when i play you'll see 10+ horde in the open world for every 1 alliance you see in 60 areas.
---
It's honestly worse trying to do stuff in the AM on Mograine for me, because there's less ally to help you out when you get caught and since there's less ally more horde come when they get the shoutout that they've got someone to camp.
---
I didn't play Nost but I played Lights hope. 
---
It was more fun.
---
Well, you'd be wrong. It's both weapons. Otherwise the dual wield penalty would be pretty pointless.
---
Dismiss all your totems at once (to hide your presence or prevent accidental pulls):
---
    /run if not UnitAffectingCombat("player")then for i=1,4 do n="t"..i CreateFrame("Button",n,UIParent,"SecureUnitButtonTemplate")_G[n]:SetAttribute("type", "destroytotem")_G[n]:SetAttribute("totem-slot",i)end end
---
    /click t1
---
    /click t2
---
    /click t3
---
    /click t4
---
Make sure your interrupt goes off, even if casting or in wolf form:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /stopcasting
---
    /cancelaura Ghost Wolf
---
    /cast Earth Shock
---
GTFO, or as I like to call it "Shaman Pally Bubble". Use it when hurt badly and you will recall in just a few seconds (Troll+Engie only):
---
    #show Astral Recall
---
    /use Gnomish Harm Prevention Belt
---
    /cast Berserking
---
    /cast Astral Recall
---
Mouseover Easy-Healing:
---
    /cast [target=mouseover,help,nodead][help][target=player] Lesser Healing Wave
---
Lastly biggest tip is to use the addon Clique. You can set it up with macros like the last one above and do easy healing on unit frames. Basically I just click on your name in raid/party and it'll Lesser Healing Wave you, Right click is the slow heal. Middle Click is Remove Poison.
---
They should just merge the imbalanced servers. They’re probably low population anyway due to the imbalance.
---
You got the magic!
---
If you're going daggers you want imp back stab
---
I feel your pain. But at begin of december BGs will come out. I hope that ftom that point it will be easier to farm honor in BGs so that the PVP world squats will spend their time there..
---
tbh there both wack. i dislike asmon for many reasons, and think advertise making bitch and whine is great, but it's also cringe to be all over someones dick like that. but on the other hand faerlina is the truman show of wow so yea
---
This looks like an unfinished post and sent out by error.
---
To make that concept clear: take 4 groups doing ubrs until the portal.
---
First group hops into bwl other groups disband and gets invited into bwl raid and hop into the portal.
---
Other way is having one 40man raid. 10 ppl clear ubrs to portal and hop into bwl then next peopme join the cleared ubrs. This takes a bit longer as u cannot run the 40 ppl in parallel through ubrs.
---
And as u need to clear ubrs anyway to get attuned u are always walk paat the portal. Bit u save the camping for the questguy and you save 2 rooms and drakki.
---
It's just not fun man. At least not in WoW classic. There are plenty of games with open world pvp that just do it better than this.
---
Well that
---
No, i just like pointing out when people are straight up lying pretending this is the same game.
---
Why does every rogue sidestep like crazy? Looks so ridiculous
---
Omfg im laughing so hard. My weed made THE single most funny thing i have read all week. Have some poormans gold. Bravo! 🏆
---
Thanks bud, new leadership in the guild is a TON better.  Believe you me
---
One minor thing my guild does is we lay on hands the tank before pull to get the long increased armor buff, it usually lasts way longer than the entire fight. Also as a priest myself I usually use flash heal on the tank in hopes of fishing for Inspiration procs, but it doesn’t always work.
---
Thank you.
---
It was a PVE server then
---
/dance with them
---
IDK about the stripping though, I rarely have enough inventory space to take off all my gear.
---
When I say "balanced" I mean groups with Paladins are stronger than groups with Shaman. Alliance raiding is easier than Horde raiding.
---
Shitty to play / not fun is not the same as unbalanced. This game is very balanced.
---

meta stands for: Most Efficient Tactic Available
---
It’s just that most people have jobs so they can afford food and shelter, which usually requires your attention from 8-5.
---
it's no worries, never had a problem with the guild itself, just that one person
---
I've been told by someone this is patched but i've done it for 3 of my mates and 2 people on reddit, as recently as 2 weeks ago.
---
They delete their char.    
---
YOU create one with the same name.    
---
They recover it, to be prompted to name change as theirs is taken.
---
Yeah. The new "go play tetris noob"
---
It is though. Just delete your character, have a friend make a character with your name, restore your character. Boom free name change
---
It’s fine. 
---
Just play from 2am-8am.
---
ye, pretty much the only way we could do RFK - had to run through every warrior/paladin/druid at our level and eventually even had to bribe one warrior to come tank for us. i'd imagine it's even worse now that a good portion of the players are 60
---
They literally admitted to designing Alliance to be better at raiding and Horde better at pvp. From racials to class balance to paladins/shaman to priest racials. They literally designed it this way just to create the single worst idea they ever had. The stupid Horde v Alliance bullshit they keep thrusting around.
---
Yes and OEB right afterwards.
---
This is because you lose a lot of rage due to glancing blow damage (because of weapon skill) and you lose 3% hit.
---
Spinal Reaper also has higher topend damage (after calculating its AP in).
---
If BWL bosses have more armor than MC bosses this will change.
---
&gt;that 1.12 was too easy
---
lol just get bad
---
We used to call it "screen hacking" when we'd play at local PC bangs. They'd supply everyone with large bits of cardboard to slide either side of your monitor during intense CoD 2 LAN sessions. Oh the days.
---
Yeah, you dont become very rich idling in town. Thats your problem right there and probobly the reason why you feel a 1g tip for a portal is a great deal, because your not doing anyhting with your time anyway.
---
Yep
---
Check out this guide: https://www.wow-professions.com/classic/mining-leveling-guide-classic-wow
---
Install a gathering add on and basically just do loops around the outer boundary of the relevant zone.
---
Me when some nagging female asks me what race I play
---
Na i've been farming the spot for over a week with no luck so two of my good friends were like screw it we'll come help since it's your birthday.
---
About 30min later we were all laughing like crazy in discord. I hit enter a few seconds before we killed the mob. Unreal.
---
Sounds good, doesnt work.
---
It does not unfortunately. That would mean we could actually learn and speak the other languages in game. If I were to type "regas" back at that horde character, he would not see whatever word he was typing.
---
The only issue with passing on something is if it gets sharded or given to someone for OS instead of being someones MS upgrade. No problem with passing to wait on their preferred combo, the chances that there is only one mage is ridiculous!
---
you have to play better
---
Will do.
---
but mah monies
---
:)
---
Sweet! Happy birthday my dude
---
Man I never got to use that ability because either the healer isn't alive anymore or they would have been too close to the mobs after using DI.
---
wasnt asmond the one to declare to his minions he wanted to whipe out a whole species to the point of being endangered? how is that not making money of hate
---
Macros, have all your wep buffs on a single bind which you modify with shift, alt cntrl.
---
Macros to modify depending on target, heal a friedn, lightning an enemy.
---
Get a totem add on, only ones you need to bind individually with a good keybind (reaction) is EB, Groudning and Tremor. Sammys totem addons, I set as cntl 1-5 and you just pick a setup of 4 totems.
---
How much are black dragonscale chest/shoulders/boots on your realms? The set seems pretty nice with the 3 set bonus on my fury warrior. I'm on ashbringer EU but the price on your realm might give me an idea how much it is. At work so can't check myself and not patient enough to wait! Thanks a bunch :)
---
how do you end up with 3 half leveled chars like that? don't start the third before the first 2 are 60 and half your problems are gone. if you like leveling this much you really should have just started on a pve server.
---
Or multiple accounts
---
Druid's are okay tanks, especially if you lean into being your guild FR tank.
---
If u don’t wanna pvp dont join a pvp server
---
Icemail Jerkin is one of the worst epics in the game. Not even worth 5 gold
---
Ah, you're one of those.
---
If you get the jump on them you can kite at max range and drain all their mana. If they open on you, shadow reflector and trap them to reset at max range. Warlocks are hard to beat as hunter.
---
So we do this strat and a fury prot takes garr and a fury prot tanks all the adds.
---
 You the add tank will walk in and body pull as you're running in pop greater stoneshield. As soon as they all clump on you aoe taunt and garr tank taunts off you to pull him off. 
---
Dps goes ham on garr. All the while you're backpedaling to the wall you'll sapper and oil of immolation right after the aoe taunt. If you have good reflect pieces use them but dont sac good pieces of gear. Flask is nice but not required... 
---
During the backpedal spam shield block on cd and hold down cleave while tabbing through for the rest of the fight. After garr dies ranged aoe and melee keep all the adds health relatively even once all are about 10% we blow shieldwall on add tank. Melee gets out and range pop them all during shieldblock duration
---
Granted your raids dps needs to be good to down garr quickly and your healers need to be stop casting
---
Random tip, there are certain abilities that are considered an "instant attack" in some sense by the game, and will this contribute to weapon skillups. For example, using Sinister Strike as rogue can skillup whatever you are using in your main hand.
---
=
---
More usefully, you can be Hunter with a slow 2-3 sec attack interval two-hander, but spam lvl1 wing clip for like 15 mana (or whatever it is) and skill-up at basically triple the speed you would be otherwise.
---
Yeah, Maraudon is the basic gold farming spot. You can easily kill all three bosses in Maraudon in 12 minutes, giving you 5 runs an hour. The average gold for all three bosses combined is around 7-8g I think.
---
You also get on average 5-7 Blindweed and 1-2 Ghost Mushroom per run, which is an extra 5ish gold. So thats around 12-13 gold per run with Herbalism leveled. That ends up being around 60g an hour. If you have to reset yourself, I'd say its around 50.
---
When I want to buy something, I always think of it as Maraudon runs. "I really want that 30 SP enchant, It'll cost me about 4 hours of Maraudon runs, doesnt seem that bad" etc. Not the best, but easy and consistent farm.
---
It does a lot more than that. Every time I report someone it just clears most of my chat log. At least a couple minutes worth of messages. It’s kind of annoying but it’s been happening since first patch of legion so I usually don’t mind it anymore
---
It's still more efficient to gangbang, even if your honor per kill is much lower. #1 reason is that solo you can actually lose the fight and die, and waste 10+ mins ressing and buffing. When you steamroll lonely players and small groups, you are guaranteed your honor + the fights themselves take seconds, so you can mount up and move to the next spot. 
---
It will all be fixed when BG's roll out though.
---
After having a brief discussion with our officers, it's come to our immediate attention that we cannot support his decisions nor toxicity.
---
He has since been removed from our guild.
---
Hahah, the fact that at least two of your chars could just be 60 right now and avoid the mess cracks me up.
---
Standard blizzard ui
---
Speedrun lol
---
How tf do I beat warlocks in pvp as a shaman?
---
Accuria is a tank ring too.
---
My wishlist from BWL and MC include:
---
MC: 
---
Accuria 
---
Heavy Dark Iron Ring
---
3 Piece T1 (It scales to 39 with improved thorns, amazing for 5 mans.)
---
Essence of Firelord (Amazing with 5 mans)
---
Fire guard Shoulders (Resist set)
---
BWL:
---
Malfurions Blessed Balwark
---
Nelth’s Trinker (lol forgot name)
---
And the Boots from Netharion. 
---
The thing is, the Feral tank gear is limited but amazing. The Bulwark gives about 1.7x the armor of the warrior T3 breastplate
---
My experience with bandages is you tend to want the best you can manage anyways simply because the HP per tick rapidly becomes less impressive even one tier down, with only the "correct" tier for your level actually giving a good heal.
---
&gt;!Upper right corner, on the right side of the palm tree!&lt;
---
DM East jump solo
---
Thank you, "horde/alliance man bad" gets pretty old to non-casual players.
---
On most PvP realms, theres enough Horde alone to likely force a queue. They're not the ones being locked out of the game.
---
I'd be fuming if staff of dominance went to our druid
---
&gt;! Upper right corner, on the right side of the palm tree !&lt;
---
This is an amazing tip! I'm going to try it right now. Thanks mate.
---
Tell that to the raids running around the 50s questing areas camping quest hubs. The only way to get to 60 right now is dungeons which means death running to BRD
---
Makes sense since its in a starter zone. It could be an alliance mirror for RFC
---
Well a lot of people that tank are DPS specced so their threat is bad because of that.
---
Not everyone wants to take the easy way out and be carried both by the population and their racials
---
Are you sure you weren't watching the zeppelin from Undercity?
---
Lol what..maybe dont be bad and lose the 1v1? Plus very rarley is 1v1 im finding myself having to 2v1 3v1 which is fine thats 900 honor right there. My honor still higher then these 9 man gank squads and i aint even out to pvp. The word "efficient" get thrown around a lot like people know what theyre talking about..but i find that its just what that popular streamer said or a video they seen so they think its efficient. My numbers still higher my honor still higher but im not efficient.
---
Given that this is pretty dishonourable I would say these should count as "honorless kills" xD
---
Youre not gonna have more fun levelling a warrior, instead of spamming sinister strike you basically just autoattack with some sunders or heroic strikes
---
Lol except Druids are tanking Ragnaros and taking less damage than Warriors. There is literally 2 fights in Classic that show the difference in classes, and that’s why you have a tanking core and not one tank. There’s also a few fights that Druids do better than Warrior. Onyxia comes to mind as the primo example.
---
Same here, have been levelling from 47 to 59 on alliance almost exclusively in Brm and Alliance controlling the mountain seems to be rare at best...
---
I count myself lucky the times alliance holds entrance to Brd or Brs saving me from 2 more deaths, but thats after the whole zone of searing gorge, the door and upper entrance area being held by the horde.  And thats players specifically there just to farm honor off people corpserunning to dungeons. Also nice when a flight to TP isn't insta death upon landing.
---
There's plenty of alliance around PvPing however, no arguments there so it would be interesting to hear from the horde how Brm in general is for them.
---
You for my vote! I want the same.
---
I was honestly mad that the horde raid left a second before I was in position to take a screenshot.
---
This is mostly true, but hunters scale very well in PVP. Its only PVE where they fall off.
---
Is this... fun for people? It doesn’t sound fun.
---
Please do that and let me know how it goes ;)
---
Damn straight, especially if you're shadow
---
 *cackles in stuns, silences and fears*
---
Obviously the 10 mil people don't play at once, what a ridiculous sentiment.
---
You dont
---
When 4 alliance is online on the server*
---
&gt; Hunters will give you an insanely hard time, don't even bother. They will viper sting the ever living hell out of you and kite you until eternity.
---
Umm, what? Hunters are basically the easiest class to play against, if you have a tool to close the initial gap (engi items, swiftness pot). You can cleanse viper sting and applying it costs them more mana than it costs you cleansing it and once you've closed the gap, they are pretty much defenseless.
---
And not everything has to be completelly wasted :D
---
Their is plenty of proof, I don’t even watch his streams.
---
The good tanks (fury) dont spam useless spells like thunderclap and shieldblock which all the prot tanks do in dungeons.
---
Have a warrior or rogue pay to come with you for their bis ring and you can probably bump that number up by a few gold.
---
perfection !
---
What kind of gear were you wearing for this, and spec.
---
Problem is that it's simply not feasible. The horde outnumbers so massively that it's hardly worth trying.
---
Well, if you are god, go for it, 1v3 everything. I'm not, and many people aren't either, and i still want honor. For me and lots of average players, it's way easier and safer to gang up and farm a location. Guaranteed honor is better than random.
---
Are you pretending that it's hard to take a zeppelin between Undercity and Orgrimmar? Because they're effectively the same thing, regardless of being located outside of the city rather than inside.
---
Eh it's not about bis raid comp, it's about there being a huge lack of druids.. My guild would happily take one or two more each raid just so we could actually distribute the loot instead of disenchanting it.
---
What'd my flame imp ever do to you??
---
Fair points on many regards however some of this has to do with if you're gunning for PvP or not. At the moment World PvP is horridly slow and boring. Maybe once BGs come out I'll push for ranks. 
---
However as it is there are several viable ways to play this meme spec of ours right now. The gear I'm using, and gunning for is good. The gear you're talking about using, is good. Check this out. 
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=dps&amp;class=Paladin&amp;spec=Retribution
---
The top two people. One is in my style of gear, the other in yours. It's as simple as that right now. In later phases things will change but right now there are a few good ways to go.
---
What gear should I have for it? I have around 260 sp, mostly prebis stuff and 2 t1 pieces.
---
Curious about this answer. Every lotus i have found sofar has a angry owl standing on it or the undead
---
There's good and bad players in every game. But in Classic, tanking is all about threat and therefore being hit-capped.
---
Most tauren warriors will be nowhere near hitcap and have terrible threat, but orc warriors with 5 axe skill get 3% free hit chance and will have better threat out of character select screen.
---
Ancient post I know, but hunters can solo farm it so yeah, gtfo my group.
---
On the verge of unsubbing because heartseeker is so bad. Nothing like what I was expecting, pretty much ruined my classic experience so far because I’ll go to a contested zone and not see more then 1 or two horde to the dozens of alliance I see :/
---
I have suggested this solution since long before launch. Community generally opposed the idea back then. That suddenly changed with Phase 2. Now everyone blames Blizzard for not doing it. Well, maybe they would have if the community had not been against it.
---
10 MC Clears and 21 Ony Clears i still have Dal Rends...gz though
---
More like P&amp;P&amp;P&amp;P&amp;P&amp;P&amp;P&amp;P&amp;P&amp;P&amp;PVP
---
Yes, the undead guards can see you from 10 yards
---
But does that first (honorless) kill not count for the max 4 kills per 24 hour? Or does that mechanic only count actual HKs?
---
400sp is really good gear. I have mostly prebis and 2 t1 pieces amd I have 260sp. Maybe I should get the shadowreath gear that just adds spell power?
---
Do it again but in a cell in the Stockades.
---
Nah, even when battlegrounds launch in 12 days erasing their 'arguments', they'll find something new to cry about.
---
49 Ret Paladin here. I just picked up [Gatorbite](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17730/gatorbite-axe) but it seems my [Bonebiter](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6830/bonebiter) with +5 dmg enchant is giving better damage overall. Do I just look at the Damage range in my profile or should there be other things? Is there a calculator for these things?
---
I wouldn't doubt that they thought of a leveling system like Diablo 2 when in early development.
---
How is someone whispering advertise asmons location breaking the rules?
---
A 60 warrior tried to get me outside BRD entrance about a week ago - I somehow feared him into the lava underneath the steel grate. The taste of justice was sweet as I watched him burn up.
---
Tremor totem and earth shocking the fear Amap helps
---
Warlocks are squishy and do a ton of threat.
---
Paladins are squishy and do next to no threat.
---
Which one would you rather use as a tank?
---
Memes aside though, Onyxia hits like a wet noodle. Like 1,5k on Cloth.
---
What? And they don't verify that the name is actually offensive??
---
It isn't the dots that are dangerous, it's the 2500-3000 shadowbolt crits on top of the dots. WTB soulshatter.
---
Pvp titles are available on pve, you won’t get slaughtered in bg’s unless your whole team is being murdered in general.
---
Wouldnt get fixed today. A GM now would just go "Well too bad, try not to get feared next time"
---
But he was able to change his name no questions asked??
---
Oh, im not a god. I just think ita funny people like you who are going around as a 9 man blowing people up farming and trying to level up thinkin that your goin somewhere and using the word efficient like you know wtf your talking about. The fact is those people are bad and ruining it for other people. You fools werent even pvpin before honor came out. Why? You gotta get somethin to do somethin?
---
I died so much today, i just wanna hit 60 lol. Release bgs already.
---
You can try scholo runs for dark runes.
---
wow
---
I'm 99% sure they can not. I think they can ride the wolf, but that might be me missremembering
---
Not to mention the graveyard for Menethil is like a mile away from the docks...
---
Wail-nig will never be unseen.
---
Blackhand's Breadth is BiS for both PvP and PvE irrespective of spec. 
---
HoJ is BiS for swords for both PvE and PvP for both combat and hemo respectively.
---
HoJ is good for pve daggers but nowhere near as good as it is for swords.
---
Would never use HoJ as dagger rogue in PvP tbh. Blackhands on 1 slot and then anything from: Barov, Death Ray, Shrink Ray, Reflectors, Insignia, Chicken, Dragonling, even Timbermaw rep trinket if you have it depending on situation.
---
But yeah. Even if you re hit capped, the DM trinket isnt bad in raids and someone needs to do the math for the 2% hit trinket when hit capped vs HoJ for dagger rogues (lets assume perd + cht for weapons with +5/crusader).
---
I suspect it will be negligible but i could be wrong. 2 other dagger rogues in my guild have 2-3 epics more and yesterday it d fluctuate which of us was ahead of whom each encounter (ofc combat spec cds play a big part) and 1 definitely has HoJ, think the other does as well but we were all consistently top 4 dps.
---
Personally i m a PvP focused player but i ve been enjoying raiding with my guild cause its people who know what they re doing, its organized and efficient and not corrupt .
---
If you're considering Ragnaros as any bit of a challenge you're proving yourself to be an idiot.
---
" I also feel like you made the choice to join a high pop PVP server so you should be stuck with your choice. "
---
A lot of us transferred to new low or medium pop servers when the option surfaced because we wanted to get away from our then-current faction imbalanced, high-pop servers which were low/medium pop when we rolled there. Then those servers became high pop servers all over again with the same faction imbalance. You really aren't getting the whole idea by painting with a broad brush.
---
" If you're given a easy solution you can pay through or just get it you dont really learn anything from the mess up "
---
What are we supposed to learn? That we deserve to pay for a bad experience because we couldn't see the future?
---
That just raises further questions!
---
I don’t see the problem.
---
It sounds like they've been giving it to you pretty hard, soooo they're probably the last ones you want to have AIDS...
---
It is miserable.  To rank up I need to sit in some area that ally will walk through and just spam moonfire non stop.  It's literally the worst system I've ever seen for a ranking system.
---
The fact that he didn't bandage or eat during the blind/sap was p cringe.
---
Deviate delight , RP pvp . 
---
Balanced factions , great community, alot of people taking it slow
---
And unfortunately this is why they won't allow these services anytime soon.  They don't want the pvp servers to die.  I'm sure things will get better with BGs as long as the qs aren't too long for horde.
---
&gt;  but you tend to skip a lot of exploration if you follow the roads either way.
---
I don't think you get xp for discovering subzones, just xp for the whole zone at once.
---
He’s a no honor kill cause of he just got off fp?
---
Ok boomer
---
This guy farms FPs
---
what don't you understand ?
---
Is it a decent mouse?
---
Just let people move to PvE servers and leave the toxic gank gangs by themselves on dead servers.
---
Rattlegore is a fairly balanced server with good population. Come join the fellas 😎
---
I hate that kind of names. Simply because every time someone says "you", "me" or similar ElvUI displays the name in the toons class color. You is always pink for a paladin. Me is yellow for rogue.
---
I could probably blacklist those somewhere though.
---
Source?
---
zul'gurub you mean ? ZF is in tanaris.
---
Great idea! The reasons you are mentioning are exactly the ones holding me back from transferring.
---
&gt;warriors arent that hot compared to casters in raid gear
---
Uh, no. That’s just flat out wrong lol. If this were true, why do guild speed runs fill half or more of their raid with warriors? All they care about is maximum possible dps
---
Esfand has turned to a cunt in Classic. Don't remember him being total twat during pserver days.
---
Duskwood is basically a series of horror novels and murder mysteries.
---
I'm multiboxing on classic with 7 accounts. Never played retail. I think of it as a hobby.
---
It’s true that it wasn’t as big of a problem in Vanilla for many reasons (less players, people still leveling and fewer lvl60, no one had finished PvE content, people wanting PvP not knowing how to optimize and just spending time in SS-TM or raiding capitals because they thought leaders grants large honor, etc)
---
However it was clear that we’re in 2019 and people takes advantage of every flaw of Vanilla to their advantage, people have guides, add-ons and a gaming philosophy that is way different than back then and it was obvious that without changes, there would be problems.
---
So again, #nochange we’re just unable to get the idea that to get a Vanilla e perience some tweaks were needed. (Like it’s stupid to have 1.12 talents and item and not having a slightly higher difficulty in PvE)
---
That kill.  The subsequent corpse camping he won't have that buff.
---
Wat.
---
Go read your people magazine elswhere, nobody gives a fuck.
---
Sure, there are always plenty of ways to play ret paladin, as we can make use of so many stats and currently a lot of items come out equal. 
---
But the way I see it, if you make bds you spend roughly 350g on it and the enchantments and get at best a single digit dps increase from it, if even that. But make it much harder on yourself to upgrade from it, because you simply must replace the entire set at once, as only using 2 pieces is utter crap.
---
Fastest i have been able to do is 21min lol but my half afk ones are around 25-30min not too bad 😂
---
I saw he kinda bugs out if i stay down there, feel safer hoping back and forth lol
---
You're directly between them and molten core, they are going to raid...
---
I am 26 and I can 100% relate to the n64 comment.
---
The reflect damage is kinda cute. It's fun to stack stuff like 3p druid T1 Thorns, Essence of Pure Flame, Naglering, etc and just run through a lowbie dungeon and let stuff hit itself to death on your mighty body.
---
Hell, I'll kill a man in a fair fight... or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight, or if he bothers me, or if there's a woman, or if I'm gettin' paid - mostly only when I'm gettin' paid.
---
fair enough, never played wow either but have experience with some korean mmos and this always happens with world pvp. next time stick to one char and get him to max level, makes gearing alts easier as well.
---
Was this done before or after they removed wall jumping? Significant detail😉
---
Cant use skills from the mindcontrolled player.
---
I play Classic and I am in Olympus, I find Asmon's character entertaining on stream, and the guy is a pretty decent sort off stream. I know about that stuff because I was in the guild and online playing the game while the drama was going on lol
---
He’s tik tok’d, is too late.
---
you wont always die, and you can sometimes manage to jump onto the bridge in front of the keep by doing the same trick but then getting on the building roof from the castle wall
---
But thats where I'm saying you're exactly why Jay said, "You think you do, but you don't". That mentality is anti-classic. It's fundamentally the mentality that will cause Classic to die off. This retail mindset of over-analyzing everything and min/mazing shit that was never hard. 
---
You are why people are starting to leave classic in droves.
---
Well if you actually join a PvP guild and organise it is fun, the world turns into a huge open battlefield
---
Instead of downvoting him explain why it isn’t?
---
demo is good for threat but I'm just trying to pump as much damage as possible. If it's 5+ I might demo shout.
---
Ah, yes, thanks. Brainfart on my end...
---
Cool idea: do you understand this is exactly what they have pulled off with layering aside from things like shared AH?
---
Was done a few hours ago.
---
He won't be honorless once he respawns. Or the time after that. Or after that.
---
The chat lag is the killer for me.
---
Can't use a boat to EKs.
---
Takes 15 minutes for a whisper to a mage for a Darn port to go through.
---
The mage is AFK
---
You are slightly better in AoE situations and PvP. On single target you are a little behind but still middle of the pack. I am just rocking barbarous edge, since we only had 1 single 2hand drop in 4 MC runs I still find myself in the top 10 usually. It is getting harder tho since anyone else gets geared af while I am desperate looking for a 2hand drop.
---
Dogs in MC. 
---
Garr adds
---
Sulfuron Harbinger
---
Majordomo
---
Lucifron
---
Gehennas
---
Plenty more in BWL n AQ.
---
I know, but I was thinking once you hit MC on the player, you run them as far as MC allows, and then enter a duel with another priest and have them MC the player away from you, and then you mount up and ride further on, and MC the player back, and so on and so forth until you walk them into BRD or BRS.
---
You use the deep run tram like once. Otherwise it’s quicker to use the FP.
---
This isn't even efficient though 20+ man groups camping an fp is pretty much fighting for scraps. You're better off either rolling in a 5 man group through questing areas or finding out where a large skirmish is currently going on between factions.
---
Ah.. I thought it's a vanilla screenshot
---
All of your major travel routes start in uncontested territory with high level guards. Alliance is forced to go into contested territory to travel between continents and have either level 40 or level 20 guards on our docks.
---
It is not even fucking *remotely* the same and it is far, far easier for Horde to disrupt Alliance travel than it is vice versa.
---
Ask a guildmate for a portal to Darnassus and fly from there to Theramore or wherever you're going. This shit is not hard, just gotta adapt.
---
I mean I'm one of the core tanks in my guild and MT rag every week, and I'm going to be continuing as Feral for the foreseeable future. When doing cat form I'm about middle of the pack in terms of DPS. Resto might be more "optimised" but Feral is far from useless
---
No.  Its more like...  very shitty and not very vanilla style gank squads cover every inch of the world and it isnt fun to be a level 48 and die every 2 mob kills
---
Because hes talking about a fictional faction IE the horde...  
---
He didn't build his stream off some irrational hatred either, and he doesn't direct his spergs to put their focus on an individual player.
---
*constantly feints*
---
have to take the good with the bad, communicating across multiple guilds, fun, getting ganked into oblivion by raid geared gank grps, not so fun.  
---
can't imagine it is fun to gank people like that either, but i guess they have to farm their honor somewhere.
---
mechanically outplayed.
---
Honestly mining if you ever plan to farm dm e jump runs, but that depends on if you have good goldfarm on ur other classes
---
This is what I did.  Was an easy run, other than the part where I ran into 4 alli crossing over Thandol Span. :)
---
Mortar is the best.
---
Ah.. I thought it was a vanilla screenshot
---
We usually roll with 5-7 people.
---
Thats less than half of what you get in dmeast on warrior
---
You cant kill bosses, but you can run around and pick herbs without killing anything
---
I wouldn't mind it as much if it weren't so constant. And the only server they offer to transfer to are a completely dead one and one that has an even worse ratio.
---
ha found him! Well that was pretty entertaining.
---
Nah, no need for dps spec. You will be slower but it's perfectly fine.
---
Yeah it sucks I don’t disagree. I’m horde on a alliance server. But it does not seem to be super crazy for me yet. I’m still in thousand needles
---
cough Carebear cough
---
A while back there where these crappy wand controllers for the ps4, no one uses them but.. there was a ofhand controller for your left hand.. now this one is a single hand controller.. you can use this and bind the keys in windows with a ps4 controller tool. This way she can use right mouse left hand comfertable with that controller.
---
PSA: please don’t do this. Getting random whispers asking me to tank dungeons every 10 minutes is not fun.
---
That seems like a lot of work for 1 boss' loot and 2 thorium veins.
---
At lets generously say 3 runs an hour you'd get ~6 swings of thorium (6 ore, 2 stone, 0.25 arcane crystals) per run plus the boss.
---
Since the ore/stone probably just pay for consumables, you're looking at 3 kills of the sacrificing boss + 0.75 arcane crystals an hour.
---
Depends how bad your slowest runs are, and how often a reasonably skilled player will die doing this. It's really neat but I'd still rather just do fairly safe/reliable 2-3 man runs that gets 2 extra boss kills per run and takes less time.
---
I agree. We moved from Gandling to Dragonfang and it has been great. People are questing, mining and herbing without getting killed. I picked 4 black lotuses so far...even they are 17g on auction. PvP is max 5v5 on daily average. And we have big organized PvP events every week where it is big.
---
Move to a better server if you are not happy with yours guys ;)
---
I like to pour the buncha crunch into the popcorn. Gotta wait for the popcorn to cool off so the chocolate doesn't melt tho
---
more like
---
&gt; constantly faints
---
* I put on my robe and wizard hat *
---
It's funny because gandling eu is weird compared to other servers it seems.
---
Our alliance is somewhere between 43~47%. We have a guild called aim who seem to rally the entire alliance side to places every other day. Even though there's much more horde, alliance is the most dedicated to the pvp.
---
Yep I was referring PVE wise
---
We gave accuria to a feral druid because the poor bastard shows up to raid every time and he sure as hell isn't getting much out of it.
---
Sap - CS without breaking SAP - Restealth - CS again - CB evis - Blind - Prep - repeat
---
You heard me.
---
Most people justdont give a shit anout rp even on rp realms thats the truth.
---
Dark runes only drop in scholo. If you mean demonic runes you can farm dme for them depending on ur class
---
Ahhhh
---
We were looking for pvp
---
I just don’t understand how people want to play on a server with 4000 players and not expect to be overrun; like the world isn’t big enough for that many people.
---
You'll last now. You seem to fail to understand you just can't do the next raids. It's mathematically not capable of happening. As part of core Classic class design flaws.
---
"as the young folks call it"
---
How old are you and what is the other name for stream sniping ? Lmao
---
Power in numbers.
---
These players probably have similar values in their everyday lives.
---
You could offer it, it wouldn't harm anything. I really doubt it'd fix anything. Even if you get some form of guarantee, your optimal condition is to swap into a 55:45 on the losing end of that.
---
Why would you transfer from a brimming full server in your favour when A) BGs are cross server, there is no benefit being the loser in Wpvp and B) BGs are coming out reasonably soon. Queues at this point aren't super insane for most servers, I'm on a transfer option server and our queue peaks at 10 minutes.
---
I hate to say it, but this is an inherant flaw in vanilla wow when knowledge is available beforehand. We could, *maybe*, have prevented this. How without either splitting up friend groups or being draconian about forcing players around servers I don't know. Maybe an immediate implementation of faction queue.
---
But I feel like the cat is out of the bag and we're more or less doomed at this point. We tried faction locked transfers, as reddit demanded, but unsurprisingly it did nothing.
---
Nah there was no hidden rogue. We went in peace
---
Sounds like RP didn't happen on an RP server.
---
But yeah I agree. Zandalari Tribe got taken over by hardcore PvP'ers who thought they could get an easy ride without any other hardcore PvP'ers there. Except now every zone above 48 is instant death.
---
&gt;That's why we're not jumping to, hey, let's just open up dozens and dozens of servers. We have the ability to do that. This isn't about limiting costs or available hardware or anything like that. We could do that easily if we wanted to, actually much more easily than having complicated tech like layering. 
---
But where we would that leave us down the line is with underpopulated servers that we have to start looking at merging or offering transfers from them to other servers to get back down in population. That's tremendously disruptive to communities and something we really, really, really want to avoid.
---
Also it's kinda important to understand current servers are roughly 3-4k players online for Full servers and roughly 6k for "you had it coming" streamer server. Nowhere close to 15k.
---
lol, on herod no one except pally with a bubble survive longer than 5 seconds through that corridor.  People without instant range damage skill can't even tag people before they die.
---
That's one of the saddest things I've ever red.
---
It could help to know, if you don’t already, that using ‘taunt’ puts your total threat on a mob above whoever is highest in threat level. So there’s no point using lots of threat generating moves, like heroic strike etc. Only to then use taunt. 
---
I found it easier to tank multiple mobs, by generating “organic” threat on one mob, sundering away, then with enough extra threat generated I could simply Taunt the other mob, dump a load of extra threat onto that one, and therefore be very unlikely to lose threat on either mob for the rest of the encounter.
---
Feral Druids get more useful items from BWL than they do MC and Ony. Our damage mitigation is not THAT far behind Warriors and we can generate more threat (if they don't have Thunderfury), what makes you think Ferals will die out?
---
I kinda expected it, but not at this scale, yesterday there where 3 alliance raids that camped the searing gorge, badlands and burning steps flight master. Blackrock was unreachable for horde players on my server.
---
Atm they can keep up yes. They don't scale well though and have extremely poor itemization for later raids.
---
So when you hit BWL and AQ gear, you can't keep up on dps unless you bring 15 crowd pummelers to each raid.
---
In naxx, you are just a mascot for your raids team basically.
---
Molten Snore is pretty funny. I can’t wait to hear the BWL play on words when it’s time to move the goalpost yet again.
---
The problem is they rewarded that with ranking and botched itemization. Original honor gear was pretty dogshit. It gave you a boatload of stam and that's pretty much it. But they decided to release honor with the 1.12 versions of honor set instead of releasing the shit one first and updating it later. It means that people actually have a reason to do all of that, and in practice it' not much of difference than let's say, farning mobs.
---
I never played WoW before so I went on a pvp server to have the most authentic classic experience and this is the first time I regret it. Our server is 70%+ horde and 
---
alliance is getting quieter everday, people quit or transfer away. Some areas of the map are basically closed for hours each day. All you can do is corpse hop forward because even in IF or SW they roll over you every 2 hours. It's no fun.
---
Out of the two servers OP mentioned, both have the same problem, but inverse of each other. One is horde dominant the other is alliance dominant.
---
The obvious fix would be to move horde from the horde dominant server to the alliance dominant server, and vice versa. But, nobody wants to make the move because they are afraid of ending up in a bad situation.
---
What about entering a duel WHILE MCing a player? I don't know if accepting a duel breaks MC, but if it doesn't, couldn't a priest enter a duel with a fellow priest and then THAT priest MCs the MCed player?
---
Accuria is a terrible feral tanking ring.  Like garbage, there are multiple pre-bis rings that are better.
---
i mean they dont care about the honor tho he still had the honorless buff
---
I mean the writing was on the wall, this is not 2004. The internet has dramatically changed, and it made a lot of the potential mystery that vanilla once had irreparable. 
---
Honestly it's been bugging me a ton since launch, the amount of people in general chat requesting for all the pro streamer strat runs, the constant layer hopping (gone now ofc), so many people are emulating what they're seeing elsewhere and I'm not even on a streamer server. In a game that relies so much on getting social group experiences, I'm definitely having a far worse time on Classic than I ever did on private servers.
---
Horde take zeppelin to STV, and run 1 minute north and they are in Duskwood. Alliance is auto-flagged here, can’t tell you how many times rogue’s and feral’s sit in stealth in the graveyard and gank you when you’re low
---
Profits before faction! The blood of goblins runs through my veins!
---
Get good noob
---
I gave you this idea ;) awesome!
---
I solo jump runs as a fresh 60 resto shaman. 
---
I don't kill last boss, just imps after 50%.
---
My runs do take some time though.
---
They’re the same people that rage irl when they get killed by people who shut up and put their money where their mouth is instead of telling everyone how great they are.
---
Super funny that a lot of them (including people in this sub) think this is legitimate and fair PvP. I don’t have issues with world PvP but don’t call these situations real PvP lol
---
Anyone here able to consistency kill warlocks? Or are they just a matchup for us. I almost always loose versus them. I use cheap shoot, hemo and then kidney. Then they at 40%life. They do that sacrifice and get that stupid shield. Death coil me and dot me. Then i am dead
---
So many blatant lies. AQ40 is a pug raid on private servers.
---
It's called input broadcasting and it basically syncs your clients so one press on w makes all clients go forward.
---
That way you can control as many clients as your pc can handle. It's not bannable, as it's not 100% automated like a bot.
---
Not really shamans. T1 is elemental pvp, T2 has an amazing 3 piece healing set bonus and is great for ele pvp.
---
Enhancement shaman gets shafted, but we like to pretend those don't exist. The two enhancement shamans finally gave up and rerolled healer and ele respectively last week.
---
And 4 really good levelling dungeons right by one of their capitals, that they can get to in a few minutes and without PvP flagging.  In return Alliance have... Gnomeregan
---
The druid in my guild for our first raid was the only druid. After clearing up to domo. He got 5/8 tier 1. 🤣😭
---
you’re a pickle
---
&gt; he/she 
---
for sure it's not a she
---
4 hour queue into 1 hour of getting ganked trying to get from thorium point to brm, group disbanding because of ganks. And then realize i dont have time to start a new group so i just give up for the night.
---
Ah i see, so it's a solution for specific examples, not like a broad solution to the imbalance. I was thinking of it as being applied across the board, not just fixing a few servers.
---
Makes sense, thanks.
---
I know for a fact you can't do most of BWL as a druid. You just lack the skills and threat. Which is why a lot of warriors went more fury. Threat is a big deal. But then again, all of you miserable basement dwelling autists are exactly what ruined classic. Jay was right, You think you do but you don't.
---
Good advice. For Hydrospawn I keep my whirlwind ready when he gets close to 50% and instantly kill the adds with whirlwind + one or two cleaves.
---
Zevrim is a no-brainer on horde with the benefit of a shaman.
---
At Alzzin, make use of the thornling seeds. They are incredibly strong. When the tunnel opens, run a bit inside and pop a seed, then use challenging shout to bridge the time it needs to spawn. You usually get more than enough seeds. 
---
With less gear and no seeds I used to switch to sword and board with Skullflame Shield, spammed demo shout and the adds killed themselves while I kept damaging the boss. 
---
Reflect gear, buffs and aoe items can also help a lot (probably Fire Nova Totem too if it's not getting killed instantly). Some gear and buffs to consider aside from engineering - starting with easy to get options: Oil of Immolation, Crystal Spire, Razor Gauntlets, Ramstein's Lightning Bolts, Heart of Scale, Naglering, Demon Forged Breastplate.
---
Perfect example of all greed fail.
---
is there any way to get the southwest tome from dire maul east on the [lower floor](https://www.almarsguides.com/AlmarsImages/WoW/Instances/Classic/Diremaul/Dire%20Maul%20East%20Book%20map%20Locations%202.png) as a lone paladin?  
---
finally saw one today while farming lashers, but i can't kill the death lash near it, with cooldowns i can barely get it to 70% hp
---
can't loot the tome while bubble is up, can't loot it in combat
---
only way i figure i can get it is, to run up, loot it before the lasher attacks and then pray to the gods that it misses every attack
---
Number 2 not absolutely required.
---
Hey, that's not true, we have an enh shaman in our raid! And he... ummm... is DEFINITELY present on the meters!
---
I guess so, at first the plan was for it to be in northernd if i recall, since there was a cinematic with Northrend
---
Try 13.
---
I'm actually in the group that doesn't like Arena, I think battlegrounds are far more interesting than deathmatch.  It's another layer of strategy on top of deathmatch, you have deathmatch fights in the AB initial LM/BS pushes, you have deathmatches in mid for WSG, and on defense/offense getting flag back.  Deathmatch is just so simple.
---
Yes, he offtanks really often and main tank is otherwise already stacked.
---
&gt; If you attack him it becomes a 1v1.
---
Then, in 3 seconds, an undead rogue opens on me from stealth, orc warrior charges me and 3 undead mages blink in and start blasting.
---
Because versus implies a proper fight with semi-even odds. This is just a massacre.
---
Given your situation, have you considered making a ‘twink’ instead? Might be preferable.
---
or all the dumbass clowns in general or trade who spam their shitty twitch link like people want to watch it
---
Yw mate
---
I mean, I remember this. And I remember it from private servers too.
---
Its literally exactly what I expected when I decided to roll on a PvE server.
---
I legit don't get why you guys imagined these mystical honorable 1v1's where everyone waited for buffs and equal competition before engaging.. What in your entire history of PvP based gaming made you think that was going to happen? I just don't understand.
---
Haven’t ganked anyone, the characters who were reported were my level 1 bank alts
---
Horde quest be like *the earth mother needs you to collect 25 kneecaps from  some sonofabitches so I can brew this potion to cleanse the well or whatever.
---
No steering wheel in the car? The madman has doomed us all.  
---
Shout out to all who rides on the right side of the road!
---
He says at the end around 70
---
If the only goal is to win the fight, there is no good reason for it to be "fair".
---
Yes, Mi Lady, my apologies. Next time I’ll just use a randomized name “Naelekk”
---
yep
---
Lol.
---
No, you spec disc. You can pvp and heal dungeons/raids.
---
Just have the appropiate gear.
---
Imagine telling someone to mature up while playing a 15 year old game literally made for teenagers
---
Yes, you could do that I think. Dueling doesn't break world PvP. The tricky part would be the distance allowed for duels to continue to work, but I suppose it would make the cross-faction player constantly an enemy, allowing for chain MC. So yes, I suppose this could work...
---
Bro I *wish* I could be hit by the Menethil Harbor boat because right now I get about two steps onto the docks before I'm obliterated by Horde no lifers.
---
Just buy mount honestly. It's going to be your biggest time saver. You'll earn more gold as you go along, 100g is not that much at level 60 and can be earned in a few hours..
---
Any thoughts on using ww as a tank? I’ve tried it and think it’s helps generate a lot of aggro but have never been too sure
---
Use this link. Not sure if temporary or permanent:
---
this is it dog, this is the master opener right here, literally what i do too
---
real recognize real, my friend
---
stance macros can save you some key presses
---
I keep repeating this, but the core issue is not population or the PvP by itself. The problem is that the ranking rewards based on 1.12 are available. You cannot offer gear that's THIS good (many blue and purple pieces are BIS, even in BWL, some even in AQ40) to an extremely dedicated and hardcore fanbase, then not offer any efficient way to farm honor other than to corpsecamp people until they give no honor anymore.
---
Blizzard is completely dropping the ball on the Honor system. The ranker rewards should be the earlier, patch appropriate versions and the problem would disappear overnight. And before someone says duh 1.12 gear, no itemization, please note that the gear came out in __parallel__ versions and did __not__ get changed over time. They instead offered a 2nd set and took the first one off the vendor. The items themselves are not progressive. You can look up both sets in the database.
---
The biggest hobby of the alliance on our server is to kill the Horde flight master and wait there for arriving Hordlers. Sometimes for hours. 
---
It's the greatest game i've ever played! :D
---
Hmmm, not sure. Maybe it did. But can you safely land in thorium point or light's hope in peak hours. I still don't regret us moving. Still enough people to have fun and not that much to ruin it
---
Just swapped to disc from shadow, can heal great and have super fun survivability while also dealing pretty decent damage. Almost 60 now
---
Got a paladin to 30 but it's so boring to level
---
Exactly what it was. Guilds band together on Gehennas to escort each other to MC.
---
According to Shadowpanter - Zeal &gt; Krol
---
https://shadowpanther.net/swords-pve.htm
---
Post low effort complaining about pvp? Get low effort responses
---
Is there a list over faction ratio for each server?
---
You did get corpse camped till 48? Wow your pretty lucky. I was getting corpses camped at lower levels before honor came out.
---
For threat? Doubt it.
---
For mitigation, obviously.
---
This is such BS
---
The nerf to spy was already pretty effective. I don’t think we can really complain about it’s current state too much.
---
Staff of dominance? I wish! Have to wait till all the locks get it (and mages depending on mageblade luck) but hopefully my time will come.
---
My eyes have been opened
---
CHT MH, Distracting OH for PvE CHT MH Skarlet Kris OH for PvP.
---
Pre-raid daggers are absolutely terrible and "farming" Felstriker is the worst way to spend your time in classic.
---
Every so often you can hear a faint scream going "my chickeeeeeeen"
---
Exactly -you defenitely do
---
At last you're having fun. Right?
---
I think mentality like yours is anti-classic. Min-maxing, saying stuff like ret palllies/ enhancement shamans/ feral Druids suck!!! Is very sad. Why are you so concerned about what people are playing? As long as people are enjoying playing the game how they like - what’s wrong with that? And if they make it work well all the power to them. 
---
Ppl who have fun playing their class &gt; ppl who play by the numbers. Stop trying to rain on their parade.
---
So which horde toon is your main?
---
I honestly never run out of quests as horde on kalimdor. The trick is to not skip any quest in any zone.
---
Experience and wits - and addons can help tremendously. Still, you have to have some knowledge on what's worth buying and for what price, otherwise addons will probably do more harm than good if you use them to buy "low" and try to sell high.
---
Should have rolled PVE scrub, get good
---
They can’t prove that he is stream sniping though as he has shown evidence that other people have seen asmongold and reported back to advertise
---
"Wow you stupid idiot, you should have read all the forum threads and watched all the YouTube analysis about exactly what was going to happen in phase 2 without any doubt whatsoever so that you would have known to roll Horde and not Alliance so you wouldn't run into these problems. Honestly, it's just on you for not doing your research instead of wanting to have 'fun' or whatever. Fucking casual, l2p."
---
Not using the app myself, but no issues with my manual installs.
---
Jesus the air raids would be worse than WW2.
---
I wouldn't hold my breath for transfers to high-pop servers anytime soon, at least while many of them still have queues in peak hours
---
I hope every Horde on the server nonstop ganks Assmond now when he decides to crawl back to Classic.
---
You're not down with the thiccness?
---
If you absolutely want to go swords stick out for a sword of zeal.
---
Otherwise your options are UBRS which isn't really worth it.
---
I've always been a daggers kind of guy and daggers are much easier to get prebis for, have you considered that as an option?
---
I haven't visited those places yet lol. Gadgetzan is still a clusterfuck sometimes when I login and 60s have a gank party inside the town but it's getting less and less frequent.
---
&gt; that cap in vanilla was like 2k players to a server 
---
Based on what people who worked for Blizzard back then and cached census addons pages for back then it was more like 2.5-3k per realm.
---
Current census addon data shows it being 3k for "full" servers with some exceptions like streamer server.
---
It's technically BIS for druids and mageblade is better for casters, so it does happen. 
---
Realistically most casters are happy with the staff and too impatient to wait on mageblade, and druid healers have blue alternatives that are more easily attainable.
---
yOu ShOuLd HaVe KnOwN wHeN yOu RoLlEd On A pVp SeRvEr
---
(i mean how could you not know that "pvp" means "pvpppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp")
---
If no sword of zeal is on sale, I recommend getting assasination blade. It slightly less dps than krol but still 2.8 speed sword with 1% crit and 3 str. Underrated and only 30-40g
---
I don’t have a horde account, Alliance only !
---
I would put it on a Jokerd.
---
I +1 this.
---
The Chance that this individual is a female is smaller than the Chance that reddit is not going to q.q when Blizzard does something.
---
this is the real answer right here
---
Gatorbite is better. It's faster, but has significantly more dps and a decent proc. However, your best option right now would be princess theradras scepter. Overall the weapons in the high 40s and low 50s are pretty bad.
---
Wow really?
---
Faction queues. Problem solved.
---
Just wait for BGs to release
---
After seeing Asmongold get every piece of loot he wanted for multiple characters in every raid i dont think its even a conspiracy anymore. Its obvious.
---
Your other DPSers are shit then. A shaman shouldn't challenge any DPS in any encounter.
---
This is plain wrong. Its soloable as 2, theres plenty of videos of people doing this.
---
nothx
---
You can loot the tome without aggroing anything, just walk up to it slowly and loot it at max range.
---
just go oomkin and make the mages/locks cry
---
Fairbanks here. Just hearthed from ZF to Gadget, got camped 3 times til I had to spirit res, teleported to ironforge, got killed by 7 rogues. Sounds like my Fairbanks alright!
---
On our pvp server the problem is that people that don't do 20h pvp sessions each day started to become raid loggers. Sure, we've already burned through most comtent content but people would still get on to farm, run dungeons, help low level guildies and just chat. It's as if the wpvp is straight up cancelling most other parts of the game for the weaker faction.
---
As the title suggests. It’s a PvP server. He agreed to this
---
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Those high level spots are always full. Makes it a stressful experience playing endgame. But there is a place for everyone I guess. I find it okay in a less pop server. BGs will be the same as they are cross realm and we can fam matta in peace
---
Blame the people being better at this game, not the addon, especially since addon was nerfed heavily already.
---
The only fair fight is the one you lose.
---
Still mostly is last I checked
---
In kinda plays into the class fantasy (though it was probably unintended, but who knows). 
---
Mages can cast for ages, doing consistent damage, due to their discipline in the magic arts, etc.
---
Warlocks can cast, like, 5 shadowbolts before going OOM and have to tap. Those spells rarely hit for their full power, but when the dark incantations align, they hit like a truck.
---
In gameplay terms tho, it kinda sucks, yeah...
---
Minus the Pve part. Oh, and add in the roaming horde ganking at most of the heavy quest areas.
---
That first shot of him in the shiny new armor was cool as fuck.
---
yeah you would think with that many stealthies they would be in a main city picking off people outside the portal room, fp camping? wuss tier.
---
It’s nice to feel wanted
---
can confirm
---
&gt;an complete moron  
---
r/feic
---
This R14 system encourages people to play an unhealthy amount of time (10+ hours a day, 7 days a week). As such, there should be a limit on the number of hours a day someone can spend in the battlegrounds (like 5-6 hours is reasonable).
---
That's cuz both cameras stoped working that night
---
Why not put a Cap on the Alliance to Horde ratio for PVP realms.  Make it so that once a faction % (based on account, not character) reaches below 40% of the server, then the opposing faction isn't able to roll new accounts on that server.
---
Arcane Intellect
---
Blasted Lands
---
Mob that can't die
---
???
---
Profit
---
RPers are straight dicks they deserve to be PvPed every time I encounter a RP group and I attempt to give them a wholesome random act of RP I always get a shoo or they break character and tell me to F off. RP is dead in this game.
---
people that think some how classic will be different to vanilla, it was like that because blizz fucked the loot for hybrids suck it up and keep healing buttercup
---
Funny, we've gotten 3 staves in 3 weeks.
---
&gt;If 2000 of those alliance quests were for levels 1-10, your information would still be correct, but the point you're trying to refute (that alliance lack mid 40's quests) would not be backed up with your 'data'.
---
Did you actually check? Even from 45 onwards, Alliance has slightly more quests than Horde.
---
&gt;  Having "more quests" does not equate to a better leveling experience
---
Is literally irrelevant when the question was "Do the Alliance have less quests?" The answer is no.
---
Levels 45-50 has Alliance players run Feralas, a quest run of Uldaman, Hinterlands, Tanaris, and optionally, STV.
---
&gt;Having "more quests" does not equate to a better leveling experience and using "sources" they way you have done so is an extremely poor way to make a point.
---
The only other "sources" would be high level players who compete for 60 firsts, since easier levelling is important for speed and player skill difference is less of a factor between both factions at higher levels. They skew Alliance.
---
You get that debuff when you spawn, no?
---
You solo DM east on your freshly dinged warrior farming for your Epic mount?
---
Predict the items that people will need, buy cheap and post higher. Funny thing is 1 copper ore went 25s a piece in one weekend when they've announced P2 was coming. Next week it was 10s. People got bamboozled.
---
If you've spent more than 1-2 days to earn 100g, it's pointless to risk it in AH. Random 60 hunter can easily earn 100g with just doing level 60 dungeons for 2 days. Can you? If your answer is no, just buy your mount and continue leveling up.
---
In my guild we have DKP system and a restor dru just took one cuz he had the biggest amount of dkp lol
---
The way it’s worded makes it seem like he’s being super sarcastic. “Present” on the charts but probably not high.
---
Im not a huge daggers guy, i like sword spec combat as well as cold blood hemo for pvp
---
r/woooosh
---
He said classic, not vanilla
---
Minus the pve part, and also add in the roaming horde ganking at the major quest areas. Hope you don’t need to go to the cemetery, prob gonna be gabled by a rogue.
---
No they still fix it as long as you didnt kill anytging
---
I never played Horde in vanilla and just recently tried it after getting tired of the sort of thing OP just experienced. I was honestly slightly angry when I found out that they had a zeppelin literally right outside of their capital city that would take them to their other capital cities. I knew they had zeppelins, but it never occurred to me that they literally went across the ocean. Add to that superior racials, far more well protected quest hubs in contested territory, and the slapdash job they did designing the Paladin, things look pretty bad for Alliance on reflection.
---
Which item would that be?
---
Got a friend that does this all day. It's not fun for him, it's just a grind to him like any other grind in the game.
---
It's just griefing at this point.
---
I only rolled Alliance because my main leveling group fell for their propaganda.
---
Why is that bull
---
A lot of people roll rp-pvp because people think the community will be nicer, which is usually true.
---
Ganking is obviously only a horde thing. Alliance rogues would never sneak around orgrimmar and instagank every low level they can get their hands on.
---
And obviously no alliance would gank at the flightpaths. Never happened.
---
Druids are great tanks! They're a massive bulk of stats to throw at bosses, problem is just that there's not a lot of gear for them until BWL/ZG.
---
My guild organizes hunts against Ouro pretty frequently. The problem is every time we do get him, a team is 8-10 immediately show up to retaliate. Ouro was camping me at 3AM when there were 7 Ally players total in burning steppes.
---
Basic obvious strat. Don’t try to demonize these content creators who are actually passionate and sincere about the game and community
---
I don't bother with the last boss, maybe if I had spirit tap I could kill the imps "for free", but as it is once the boss reaches 20% he becomes slower and basically always stays at the far end of the path so I can't reach him without getting hit by everything else. Also if there are red lashers it's not even worth trying, you'd have to kill lasher packs before pulling boss and that's a huge waste of time.
---
Ironically, it isn’t.
---
I got to 60 way before p2 even came out. Decided I didn’t want to play on that server and rolled on pve-rp server to just dick around and have fun. I was eventually given a free transfer for my 60 off of Kromkrush. The options? Latin America or Brazil... oh ok. So now I have a 60 just sitting on a server I will never play.
---
Griefing on a PvE server is a lot less tolerated by Blizzard, because PvP is not an option to solve the problem. For example taunt leashing Azuregos by the opposing faction was a bannable offense back in vanilla on a PvE server, while it was fair game on PvP.
---
R u ok?
---
That's a different story entirely, palas do significantly more damage against undead.
---
i think the main reason it was an issue in Vanilla is people put so much stock in the Tier sets, we now understand these aren't the be all and end all, we now know it's not but the down side as a druid is warrior Tier sets play to their favour with tanking, even if not raw threat generation, feral is all over the show with a heavy focus on healing.  
---
as long as you are getting the kit feral can be done but you are competing with rogues as well as the shaman/hunters/warriors that want the leather to up their dps
---
orgrimmar has like no guards at all
---
the alliance can walk straight thourgh the gate and up to the bank/ah before pulling the first guards - good luck trying that in sw or if
---
The ”nerf” to SPY by reducing the combat logs range, only made it easier to catch a rogue going into stealth.  Smaller space for the rogue to potentially be on.   
---
Picked afew out by spamming Holy Nova.  Doesnt always matter since batching is dumb and i get ”entering combat” but still get cheap shot.
---
Get a 3rd one until u get about 4k hp, 4k armor, 20%crit, 600-700ap (unbuffed)
---
Good and easy/cheap items to get for the last boss are: Oil of Immolation, Crystal Charge and Ramstein's Lightning Bolts. Get Death Grips gloves for Hydrospawn and Alzzin.
---
Always keep sunders up, thunder clap, and demo shout.
---
Is it guaranteed, if you earn 100g in 10 days, what will you do if you have nothing to sell because all items you've bought got flipped?
---
It's not the talents it's the approach. To quote Kobra-kai: strike hard, strike first, no mercy". You have an immense advantage if you catch the target by surprise, and can beat most classes of equal gear level regardless of spec.
---
To get the upper hand you need the Spy addon. Even if it's nerfed it's still useful.
---
Good points, but:
---
&gt; At &gt;=6 mobs, spam Demo shout.
---
Should be Battle Shout. Demo shout is not only fixed since its bugged iteration early in classic it can also be resisted while Battle Shout can't (and given you hit all your party members generate more threat).
---
it's not that they are taking less damage, they take more, but they are better designed to take big hits, higher health pool and more armour, but on the whole they normally take more damage
---
Thank you!
---
Jumping the shark.
---
And the fact that there are horde players actually defending this is just purely disgusting.
---
fp camping is perfectly fine, the method you'Re talking about is a priest mc's a target and enters a duel with someone else who then kills the target which results in no one but the 2 duellists getting honor
---
Must be nice to be horde lol. Zevrim is a pain in the ass for alliance bc he constantly sacrifices and heals and for alzzin imps need to die fast since they do a sht ton of dmg
---
Oh, so if it is targeting races, not just a simple person, it is not a targeted harrassment. I see now.
---
PvP also happens on balanced servers.
---
\^didn't play vanilla
---
Are there any addons that can show who in the raid currently has aggro from an enemy?
---
Oh I also noticed that you suicide on last boss. There's a tiny ledge just to the right of the tunnel that you can stand on to evade the boss/imps, and then invis pot inside, but it's a little tricky to do as the imps can re-enter combat with you after resetting. I use shadowmeld to permanently reset them before going invis, but it's still possible without.
---
Elite Dangerous has a big problem with "space pirates" attacking other players without any big repercussions. 
---
Even some of the pirates think this is bullshit because it just chases away healthy competition (they play solo mode instead of online mode)
---
So how do they protest? Every time the devs have a livestream talking about future updates, they get stream sniped relentlessly!
---
Perhaps my favorite is when they had just launched ED for ps4, and they did a ps4 stream, and people geared up in record speed and ganked them. 
---
Pirates got some hefty fines that followed them through death, they basically had to buy new ship and gear them up if they wanted to clear their names.
---
"Asmon himself"
---
Dude you stopped your medicines or what the hell? Who the hell is Asmon to count there? You said that like Asmon would have any power on twitch or at Blizzard.
---
Well, you. like everyone else, was warned about it several months ago. People had it coming.
---
your UI is hurting my eyes
---
For rogues lay your freeze trap on yourself. Honestly just free trap yourself all the time spam concussive. Disengage flares. In groups just multi shot the hell out of everything
---
Hunter is a lot about knowing your burst (aimed shot, arcane shot, multi shot, auto shot) and using it properly. Scatter shot is very important when some melee classes get the jump on you, so is feign death freezing trap. Then you hop away as their crippling poison/hamstring wears off and line up your burst. Raptor strike and wing clip when they close the gap, then psuedo kite them squeezing in an arcane/multi shot where you can
---
Not sure if Aurastone Hammer would be better for droods considering they're the gods of mana management, but I would argue it's better.
---
Twitchy fingers due to poor energy management, in this stage of the game.
---
From experience - I'm averaging about 35g per day (from low effort flips) - there are days where you don't find you usual flips, but other times you get better deals. Over a week it tends to middle out.
---
Obviously it's not guaranteed, but once you find your stuff it seems to be consistent.
---
I still think op should by mount first. After 40 he gets so much gold from quests he'll be at a reasonable investment amount in no time and move a lot faster around the world.
---
Didn't have a problem with gearing I just didn't like the lock. Druid was alright but nobody wanted a druid. And rogue was my favorite, but can never find a tank, so I just rolled a tank on a PVE server
---
How do you level range weapons as warrior? :-/
---
Jesus christ, no wonder you have no idea which channel to post in. I was referring to LFG channel, the LOOKING FOR GROUP channel is where you post when you are looking for group, like I said, it is in the name. Why is this so difficult for you?
---
Well, they're talking in large part about Naxx, which by the time that came out, pretty much all the talent overhauls had already happened.
---
If you can wait 13 days you can pickup the Alterac Valley quest crossbow which is slightly better then the Stratholme one anyways ;)
---
Now that's a stupid reply. He's clearly saying you can't compare aslon having a guy camped for only 8 hours to this same guy whose whole existence is dedicated to camoing and harrassig asmon. It's not quite the same scale.
---
Satisfying when 2 people jump you and you wreck both of them though
---
100g in two days is terrible. You can make 100g in a few hours
---
You win some you lose some
---
Fuck dude im going to farm a set to respec in the week to farm gold and do actual shit. There's literally nothing enhancement can do in this game D:
---
Benediction has definitely not been exempt from PvP drama. It's just not as grotesque as servers like Skeram where the faction imbalance had already slid past the point of no return. Horde players are still camping many FPs with the exception of brief Ally takeovers, and Menethil Harbor is being harassed/camped pretty much 24/7. Pretty much every single non-60s in my friend's list have stopped playing since phase 2 release and many people in my guild are raid-logging.
---
How is it not against TOS?
---
It's literally using a 3rd party program to gain an unfair advantage over other players, that's black an white in the rules.
---
We've got a nice balance of 4-5 priests, 2-3 shamans and 2-3 druids depending on the week. Really works out great, we've got balanced group and spot healing.
---
The total threat generated is based on how many people you hit, that threat is then divided to all the targets youre in combat with, it should work like any other buff/heal
---
You can check in the logs which rogues wear daggers and do not use BF in any boss.
---
I have been raiding all through vanilla in SF daggers build (leveled as combat maces and respecced at lvl 58), and I can tell you that by no means its at 50-60% dmg of combat swords. I am waaaay above feral druids, but my item level percentile (my rating of damage with rogues with similar equipment) is probably around 30% lower than it'd be with combat swords. I would say that a SF dagger rogue half-way between preBIS and BIS (that's me with a gutgore ripper MH) will deal a similar amount of damage (or slightly more)  to a combat sword preBIS rogue (with dal'rends). Still, you can top the meters in certain bosses that favor your build: that is bosses where white damage is not that significant because you pull back from aoes/are feared/etc. In those fights, combat rogues loose a signifficant amount of their dps as it is more based on white damage. In very short fights or cleave fights, Combat also has an edge thanks to AR and BF.
---
But overall, SF is a perfectly viable build in MC, where you can even bring meme-specs. In BWL, the gap will be noticeable but you WILL be topping dps in Vael, making you useful. As SF scales better with equipment than combat, at some point in AQ40 SF will become the TOP build for pve rogues and have a signifficant edge over combat in Nax.
---
Try it! you will be able to do pve and will not suck in pvp! Most fun pve build for rogues by far
---
Depending on targets you hit with bshout and targets u hit with demo, demo gives flat threat to all targets hit while bshout depends on how many allies you hit and how many enemies youre dealing with.
---
Be ele. Crit.
---
This took me sooo long!!
---
Cool video Sniffed - Razorgore represent! 
---
Sadly i got GF agro and missed the 'charge' to BRM so had to suffer a few ganks from the horde who had rezzed after being steam rollered!
---
You can just wait untill 10 december for BGs release
---
1 UBRS run takes few hours including the running time and it's not worth more than 30g if you are not a LW. I said a random player, not a DM farmer.
---
Finally i see my server on this sub
---
So, if the server hasn't got enough players to complete it, everyone should abandon it, reroll on other servers, get to 60 and raid MC/BWL again until they get the gear to go into AQ? Cause that would have to be the plan for a lot of people if it didn't auto complete.
---
It’s not stupid if he gets the gold he’s after.
---
Has there been a classic update released?
---
Ironically I think it happened on Ahn'Qiraj EU.
---
Who shit in your cereal?
---
Yeah I kept laughing at the rogue not dismounting for ever, especially at the end they just fed them a kill. And the fact that they just kept running right into the traps without thinking
---
I wouldn't be so sure about that, it seems twitch is banning right and left
---
https://youtu.be/UYFPSho9RQQ
---
If you want maximum passive gold you go alchemy, farm out timbermaw friendly, and do a daily earth to water transmute.
---
no dagger drop from mc at all since september 25. i literally have 1000 dkp.
---
So, how was this data collected?
---
First step is to install a AH addon. Auctioneer, auctionator, TSM etc.  
---
1. Scan the AH as often as you can both on weekdays and on weekends to get as much info on the market as possible.
---
2. You can "flip" things. Ppl tend to try to sell things fast and therefor they sell it cheaper than the others. Buy and re-post on AH for a profit.  
---
3. If you have mining you can buy ORE and melt into BARS and sell for a profit.   
---
4. If you have enchanting some items sell for less than the disenchant value and you can make a profit just by buying, disenchanting and re-post the material.  
---
5. Post healing pots, flasks etc on raid days and materials for alchemy.  
---
6. Check /2 trade chat for ppl that want to sell items fast and buy them cheap and re-post at AH.
---
There are other ways to earn good gold too but the above ones are my go to ways of getting some extra money when needed.  
---
GL and get that gold cap :)
---
That's the spirit!
---
if you have a really dank healing druid they should be pretty well considered for a staff of dom, unless somehow your top locks don't already have one/mages don't have mageblade or whatever. 
---
then again i'm pretty sure other alternatives for druids are pretty damn good vs caster dps only gets a few good choices and none of em are easy to get really lol (raid wise anyway)
---
Sure, but once there's more than one enemy tabbing though targets becomes less than ideal, especially with enemies in MC that use spells to change target.
---
It's the same as going to Dire maul and kill flowers for gold, Sure it's boring but you do it for the currency.
---
Gold and honor is both a boring farm.
---
I have been on and off looking since 1hr ago!
---
I feel bad for him/her. They have that retail mentality of seeing specific classes doing top dps on boss fights and bringing only those classes because of those statistics.
---
The links don’t work
---
There is no fair wpvp. Even when it's 1v1 someone always has an advantage or multiple.
---
The other day I ran into a tauren warrior at 30%ish hp eating in EPL. He was hiding behind a tree. I waved at him and targeted him but made it clear that I'd wait for him to get back to 100% before I fight him. Then we started and only 5 seconds later a roaming group of 5+ hordes rushed in and just took me out.
---
Who do you think the moron of the story is here? That would be me. I gave up a clear advantage but then they leveraged theirs, I was dead and they carried on laughing at the easy kill.
---
Or spell stones
---
It would introduce a lot of new problems though. Imagine a lvl 1 gnome outside orgrimmar jumping into horde players AoE when they are dueling just to grief them with DKs.
---
Good to see Razorgore being nicely balanced. Doesn’t reflect so much in the world as horde like to pvp a bit more
---
Although I was originally looking for actual wally, then I thought he'd been too obvious because of his colouring, so then I began looking for a horde person dressed closely to wally
---
Wpvp on a pvp server definitely doesn't seem to be from all accounts but I gotta say, sitting on a pve server, the wpvp outside Org has been the most fun I've had in the game in a good solid while.
---
500g gets you devilsaur set and some arcanite bars for Lionheart. 
---
Weapon wise, you want to go for dal rend. Alternatively, thresh blade/mirahs song until you get both - but you don't need money for either
---
I was really looking forward to try rp in classic but on both rp realms (EU) there was virtually zero rp going on. It was a major bummer to me. Very disappointing.
---
Horde has better coverage on most PvP servers for BRM too. Closest Alliance FP is over in Redridge pretty much
---
Why do u guys need repair bots
---
Please don't post if you're going to be completely wrong
---
Most assholes I've seen are always undeads or gnomes.
---
Vuhdoo frames for example allows giving people a red border (or whatever you like) if they are targeted by an enemy. I like that feature
---
I should have been more specific in terms of roaming zergs. I'm aware of the TM/SS chaos.
---
Which server ratio allows one faction to do it constantly in your opinion?
---
think just about all of our warlocks and maybe 1-2 mages have staff, its at the point where GDKP last week staff of dom went for 300g to our main tanks ele sham alt for pvp...
---
for reference, mageblade went for 2250 the day before, and tonight toep went for 1250 lol
---
that night i paid 350 for ony bag...more than staff of dom LOL
---
that said, weapons are HUGE rng/luck, some guilds have gotten mutiple BREs and some have gotten an earthshaker and maybe OEB and thats it...some guilds have multiple deathbringer warriors and some guilds have none.   
---
RNG can be a huge bitch too, it seems skewed to be shit for twice as long as its good, example, I hit 60/joined guild/started raiding idk 6 weeks or so now, when I joined and at the start all locks except me + one other had t2 head (about 8 people?). Before we joined they were literally giving people second t2 head for second enchant/sharding them. Since then, 0 t2 heads have dropped in a raid that one of us needs..think there are a few more that need it now though.  Funny enough, last night in a bonus ony priest t2 head dropped and we had 0 priests lul.
---
I have almost made it there but honestly, it's not an easy route and most frustrating one imo.
---
I did a pug monday, I think the Raid Leader has 4 people from his guild in the raid, almost everyone else was recruited from trade chat or people bringing an extra friend or guildie, we did 9/10 in MC
---
You do BRD pickpocket runs? How much on an average run? I'm a rogue too in the same situation...
---
I’d take 2% hit and a good bit of stats over a Naglering. It’s different for alliance side we don’t have two great mitigation rings built in.
---
If you had dibs on all the loot you'd be decked out in two runs as well.
---
Cheapshot, hemo, gouge, deathray, coldblood, eviscerate
---
I remember in WotLK I was AFK in Icecrown on my warrior for a little bit, came back and there was a dead rogue right behind my character.  
---
I looked at my combat log and saw they had attacked me and died from the reflective damage, while my character just stood there.
---
Useless? The blacklist is the best thing in this addon so far!
---
I am afraid if and when they introduce paid transfers. Servers will become even more polarized.
---
&gt; Because Blizzard didn't have the foresight
---
Are we talking about vanilla Blizz or classic? Because I can forgive blizz for making weird decisions on this in vanilla. And classic we are in a firm "no changes" philosophy so I'm not entirely sure what Blizzard can actually do.
---
Making changes ruins the core philosophy of classic, ignoring the problems is also bad.
---
This is a lose/lose situation for Blizz.
---
I rolled for a PvE server because unlike 15 years ago, I now have a job and a wife and other responsibilities, so can't afford to be spending more than half of my limited play time running from a graveyard to my corpse. 
---
I do sometimes wish I was on a PvP realm, just so I could briefly enjoy the fear. You can flag for PvP but during levelling that's never going to work out since most levellers don't flag.
---
depends. in most cases yes. but if your guild has a really goddamn good resto druid and your casters who want/deserve it already have it, well, who else are you gonna give it to lol
---
i'd rather a good ass resto druid have it than a subpar caster 100%
---
press shadowbolt really hard :&gt;

Oh I'm sorry. I didnt see the link that you replied to. I was only looking at the original image and got confused. I don't know why I got downvoted I was honestly confused and sorry if I was being a dick or something.
---
Thanks
---
The icon for both buff is shown, but it doesn't stack. Try it next raid and look at your stats while doing it, agil wont be counted.  
---
Just a graphic bug
---
This is what’s hilarious about the ordeal - my server (Blaumeaux) was 50/50 a couple months ago, then phase 2 dropped, horde hard-camped EVERYTHING and now it’s a massively horde-dominated server as the alliance players have fled so they can actually play the game.
---
Hope the hordies enjoyed the “honor” they got, more and more guilds are leaving by the day and soon they’ll starve from the lack of PVP available to them.
---
This community on classic reddit is the most pathetic gaming community i have ever come across in my entire life. The ammount of whine and fuckin crying that is happening on this subreddit is UNFUCKING real. The ammount of exageration and hyperbole is aboslutly insane. Learn to fuckin play, how about you get some fuckin invisibility potions for example?!?!?!?? NOT ONCE has it taken me longer than 3 death to get into ANY INSTANCE in BRM, everytime you die you get WAY FURTHER ahead in ghost form, then when you ress you pop a invisibility potion and get way further, like learn to fuckin utilize what the game has to offer instead of crying. People claiming they "abandoned" multiple lvl 60's to roll on a PVE server hahahahah BULLSHIT.  
---
These retail players are fuckin hillarious, they are too used to retail where horde and alliance never ever fight. Now they get a PVP fight once in a while and act like the game is unplayable.  
---
You whiners begging for trasnfers are the vast minority, 95% of the players are ingame enjoying the game.
---
It is way more balanced, never seen this on Grob.
---
hahaha thats so shitty. druids get all their gear so cheap/free so they can save up for big-dick items. not fair!
---
then again, they do have to play a druid, so i guess it balances out....heh, see what i did there?
---
Totally possible but hard to tell when one side barely plays enough to get preraid gear and the other is a highly weaponized army.
---
There's a few ways to do the pull
---
* Have a hunter pull and feign
---
* Have a mage pull with iceblock
---
* Do the pull yourself
---
Either way use a sapper and wear mitigation gear, not FR.
---
what a stupid logic. prot warrior is dead since furry prot is perfect spec for raid. prot is perfect spec for 5 ppl. raid &gt; 5 ppl. Prot would be more than alive if respec would be available. but it is dead since it too fckn expensive to respec
---
We haven’t seen a single staff. We have more OEB’s than we can handle though.
---
How is it abusing the game?
---
Oh so you think if you said "I am not whiteknighting" it becomes true. Interesting.
---
I am pretty much sure Blizzard would consider it a proof of communicating and working together with another faction which is a bannable offense. This one is easier to prove than devilsaur mafia.
---
chain/mc npc is controlled most nights by alliance raids it seems, it's usually fine for horde once you are on the brs balcony or in front of brd. more skeletons than players in front of those instances since honor went live tho, players tend to wait inside instead of outside now and move outside together after a run as well.
---
To be fair people did know this was going to happen in phase 2. The honor system in vanilla (not saying it should be changed) is one of the worst systems in the game and it promotes shit like this. Even when battle grounds come out people will still do shit like this between them.
---
This isn't a surprise and people 100% knew this was going to happen before launch and stated it multiple times in threads
---
cry about the forced respecc when we dont have our walking 3% spell crit anymore?
---
Warlock with his burst can easily 3v1. Lots of the players still dont know about stamina. Pop mages all day. Last 3v1 was on ferales was warrior mage lock. At first was mage and warrior. Warrior opened up and he got charmed. The mage was bad not using his counter spell correctly and ice block on cooldown (i think??) got feared with shadow curse corruption siphon shadowbolt shadowburn dead. Re charmed warrior to re up. Warlock friend flew up curse of tounge insta banish fear before he knew wtf happened. Amplify curse exaustion on warrior corruption siphon he intercept death coil shadowburn dead he was about 3/4 life when starting fight cuz bad. Then yeah finished lock with his cool nemesis helm, bad.. warlock very powerful if used correctly.
---
I read this as: I'm a little bitch who can't handle pvp and still rolls on a pvp server
---
I have a lot of screenshots from the AQ opening on Ahn'Qiraj EU, loads of people gathering up and i know Moo got the scarab lord title so i would guess we opened it the right way and not auto? I did mostly pvp around that time though so i didnt really pay to much attention. 
---
We were a lot later then other realms though since AQ realm released in like january 2006 if i recall correct.
---
What do people farm Mara runs for?
---
Most of those dungeons are similar in difficulty. I would recommend getting more equip before trying DM West, while DM East is the easiest of the bunch.
---
You are obviously not preraid-BiS, as those dungeons are the place to get those items. So why wouldn't you be able to go there?
---
There are also some quests that will give you really good tanking stuff like the Darrowshire questline for a really good ring for example. Not really adviseable if you are a minority faction on a PvP server I guess.
---
From my experience playing on ZT from launch, you get the best RP experience on RP guild events. I don't expect RP to happen "in the wild" anymore and neither should you if you don't want to be disappointed. Join an RP guild and you'll find plenty of entertainment  :)
---
Nah don't trust that. Twitch bans are garbage and often not investigated. Paymoneywubby was recently banned for invasion of privacy for streaming in a restaurant where he had permission from the manager, no complaints etc.
---
Usually 10g a run which takes roughly 15min but i cant consistently kill the pyromancer boss which is a reliable extra 4-5g per run
---
Found! Under 5 minutes :p
---
so I guess, *Naxx was wotlk* was **ACTUALLY** correct back in 2002
---
You can mute and adjust volume for the music bots seperatly. But that just as an FYI completely unreleased to the rest of your post.
---
I never watched him before but I'm glad I didn't waste anytime doing so if this is how he has turned out.
---
Then he shouldn't stream it my man. It's not twitch job to defend you in a game
---
When you put on something way too cheap and someone insta buy it and resell for twice as much?
---
Crowd pummelers ftw!
---
IMO Krol blade + Mirah's is worth it, you're almost guaranteed to spend more time farming MH/OH combo than it takes to just farm the gold for KB+Mirah.
---
Bad luck man.
---
We just got two crossbows in two runs yesterday.
---
In one of the developer interviews they stated that AQ was the first raid they started working upon. I guess that explains the scope of it, AQ being a huge zone.
---
I don't think it as bad in my servers as it is on large US and UE server but yeah that clearly what I am afraid off
---
And the people farming honor will likely be out in the world to have more honor if they have huge queue.
---
The thing is people trying to rank up cannot stop now, no one want to be deranked. They should have release WSG this week, each day there is less and less alliance.
---
What about people who aren't using warcraftlogs or keep their logs private or unlisted? What about people who simply don't raid? Seems to be very inaccurate.
---
I mean, asmongold can transfer aswell if he dislikes faerlina that much.
---
ORC DONT CARE ORC SMASH. LOK'TAR OGAR
---
In LHC you can still have the honorless buff for the first res and if they tag you quickly it still counts
---
Hooker after you watch a movie...
---
Cum on man.
---
Its 2019! 
---
You are a strong independant gender liquid person thing. You can see a movie alone.
---
That's a blizzard problem, They are responsible to make sure any and all realms have decent pop, and if they don't then just instant server merges, Don't even think about it.
---
Always make sure the servers have decent pop
---
Congrats! Dropped on the second mob of our first MC raid too! As a casual guild, we were so excited! A warrior got it.
---
A week later he left the guild :(
---
Leveling instead of wasting my time in BGs, but maybe I got the release schedule to thank for that.
---
Wailniga please
---
There's not that many weapons out there that are better... And you can't buy them for gold
---
The worst of them all are people who whine about whiners though.
---
My mistake, I didn't see the link above I thought the original image was what was being discussed and thought I missed something that was blurred.
---
Good thing it wasn't a Maiden's Circle!
---
i did 30 or so runs for the robes of the exalted even though literally every other healer i could see had them, shit happens
---
Whats the problem then? Because this is a great feud with a huge money match.
---
I agree. Have seen a bit more flaming now I'm getting to 50 (pc broke so couldn't play for a while) and more people just expect you to be good at a dungeon. I ran ZF for the first time a few days ago and the tank was cancer, ended up wiping us 4 times so I just quit the group. I have then ran it a few more times and the groups have been generally friendly. I do miss the big scrabble from the first few weeks of levelling.
---
Wait only Advertise relies on drama? Have you even seen asmongolds streams in classic ? Drama after drama cause that's what he brings to faerlina.
---
All those skull level players who kill me now will have a bad day some point in the next months (:
---
You can camp zeppelins, I used to do it often.
---
IIRC you have to be belowdecks when docking.
---
Running consistantly 4-5 Tribute runs in an hour is, to say the least, not gonna happen.
---
You need to practice the run A LOT to get it right. Even after knowing everything, you can get screwed because of lack of luck: patrols being quite random, mob resisting your fd (let's be honest, nobody specs into improved fd if you want to raid/pvp), taking some weird aggros from bugs, etc. A death, depending where it happened during the run, is a 10mn-15mn waste. 
---
Overall, doing 3 runs in a hour is already extremly good. 4 runs grant you about 120g (selling pops, recipes at AH) which is amazing. 
---
You should try it, but you're going to need strong nerves untill you get it done the first time. You get to die to every bs mechanics you don't see in yt videos and improvise a lot. Mara is a piece of cake compared to DM tribute.
---
Was only raid druid on early vanilla, can confirm.
---
we raid wednesdays and we do that lemming thing since like week 3, apes and salad gankers left us with a lot of practice and what to expect for p2. the video in the op is just the logical conclusion to what your side did since the beginning. and no, brm is not always on lockdown, especially in the evening i still do plenty of lbrs/ubrs/arena on my alt and it is rare that i don't have to corpse walk. not saying that there aren't horde in brm at the same time killing those alliance players that want to get into those instances as well.
---
You're welcome and happy cake day! I have to add, that for me, setting it up was a pain, but now that it is set up, I reallly enjoy the frames.
---
You love to see it
---
I thought that was for feral dps, not tanks? or do tanks use it on pull to get high threat gen?
---
You are whining, though. 
---
&gt; This is a game its supposed to be fun.
---
Yes, we want it to be fun. But it's not fun to get ganked for 90 minutes before you reach the entrance of BRD.
---
This is on Incendius! I always get a kick out of watching you wander drunkenly around Flame Crest.
---
it do be like that sometimes
---
I wish there was an alliance equivalent to rfc! But alliance got Deadmines which I wouldn't trade for any of the many horde leaning dungeons we got.
---
I tried...  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e20scg/whats\_the\_difference\_between\_any\_ddos\_attack\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e20scg/whats_the_difference_between_any_ddos_attack_and/)  Got the same "go PvE" answer foaming from the toxic mouths
---
- Faction specific queues
---
- Free faction change from dominant faction.
---
- Faction specific server transfer (already applied now, but too late)
---
Rank 4 Flash healing the raid is pretty standard to keep everyone topped off. If you are main tank healing Rank 1 Gheals are good and rank 3 heal if you have a poor mana pool.
---
Fights are less than 2 mins long, so unless your guild is in bad gear, flash is perfect for healing.
---
Mileage varies ofc, but I dont see many priests casting standard heals while clearing trash or doing bosses. But then again we're all fully raid geared so idk.
---
You say "Log onto char of the opposing faction on 2nd account, /who (Playername), fly to the zone, /1 anyone see (popular playername)?" is enough to find them? :o
---
Tribe got taken over by hordies that play alliance its sickening you cant kill them and horde wont kill them.
---
Are you French, Clyde?
---
that 3% spell crit isn't worth taking up a raid slot, even if hes in a group with your top casters
---
3% crit is kinda minimal if you're buffed/world buffed/have halfway decent gear anyway. the more crit you have the less crit matters
---
Literally bad. Do not listen to this guy.
---
I thought the definition was making your peepee look bigger
---
Mageblade is a sword right? druids can't use. Aurastone+DM 37 heal offhand&gt;staff of dom
---
Because the entire post was about making the fight quicker. He already said they have no problems with Garr.
---
Doesn't the in game raid UI show this with a red border around the player frame? Or is that only in Retail?
---
Nobody gets ganked for 90minutes in BRM, thats a blatant lie, its mathematically impossible given the distance and time it takes to get to your corpse.
---
Thanks for proving my point about hyperbole and exageration, keep beeing pathetic boys. The rest 95% of us will just enjoy playing :)
---
Does raid gear for shaman drop even if you are ally (thus wasting the drop)?
---
And paladin gear for horde?
---
So it's data from only raiders, that are showing up in Warcraft Logs - so completely useless to determine relam population and class distribution? Okay.
---
But you are absolutely not one of them! Well played OP (the last micro second pot made me uncomfortable!)
---
#**WERNING**
---
What are you 5? This is literally a pre-school argument, yikes
---
It was just a website that I heard about and checked out.  I don't really know many sites that show reliable server population, but I just wanted to share this site.  Do you recommend any sites that are similar?
---
Man that mark of the chosen really turned things around
---
I laughed inordinately hard at this. Thank you.
---
Is that xperl on the party unit frames?
---
Coordinated and geared raids can do riskier things to clear the raid faster, OP is asking how he might do that on garr
---
Standard raidframes
---
The PvP on a PvP server meme needs to die, people that truly believe it clearly didn’t play vanilla all the way through and it has been stated many times I know.
---
But I did, and the population truly does matter. My memories of getting ganked when I was an absolute monsternoob leveling a resto druid are few. 
---
My condolences to those on very one sided realms, those without stealth and those not yet 60.
---
Before nerf : Aight, theres a Rogue somewhere.
---
After nerf: Shit! Rogue on me! Spam*spam*spam* knocked out of stealth
---
Uhhh kinda. Afaik it technically lowers threat by a percentage on who it hits. From my understanding the whole mechanic is either really clunky or really random and the worst part is, threat meters are broke, they don't display any of the threat drops....its my 7th week raiding and i just found that out yesterday.   
---
i was literally soulstoning myself and taking a death when i got aggro p3 because i couldnt figure out why i had aggro despite being lower on threat than the tank LOL
---
and the funny thing is the strat actually worked really well, i was top caster DPS quite a few times, once even in my pvp mount set on with carrot/mithril spur boots
---
Prayer before carving the Thanksgiving turkey 👍
---
Take a look at (Payo)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-czOmPo1JYi1wKFi7wY8w]
---
I opened your profile and it appears all you do is streamer's fanboyism with multiple threads created about them. Borderline depressing.
---
Yeah, Vanilla started with a 2500 player cap which increased over the 2 year lifespan to about 3000 at the end. We currently have some Classic realms with more than 5500 concurrent players online (potentially 6000 cap).
---
A relatively okay faction split of 60:40 from Vanilla on a current 6000 player realm already turns into a very unhealthy 2400:3600 distribution. That's over **1000 players** **more** on the stronger faction. For illustration, that's 25 full 40 man raids - in the exact same sized world.
---
Also, all the reasons Blizzard gave for using layering are actually still present after the forceful delayering of the big realms for phase 2; just not for the low level zones but now for the 50+ zones.
---
Kek
---
Aaah... Damn. Thanks
---
People on both sides have those who keep their logs private. And the results correlate well with other data including auction house listings and manual /who zone searches. In fact, minority factions are often less represented in contested zones than this data suspect so your actual playing experience will be worse than this population imbalance.
---
Majority faction players need to stfu trying to diminish population imbalance issues. When all the available data corroborates faction imbalance, it exists, sorry to burst your utopian bubble about both sides being balanced.
---
Dude, not cool. Gaming obsession is a human thing, not exclusively male thing.
---
Why did you set HS in booty bay??
---
Do people still not realise the ones doing this are bots
---
Your guild must be complete dog shit if that's the case.
---
heartstriker is a 70/30 alliance pvp server, we certainly don't need more
---
Thanks a lot man, there are a few things I could've done like used rocket boots and played certain parts a little differently but yeah. I appreciate it
---
Ok boomer.
---
Feral tanks in these early phases benefit from having nearly too high mitigation - especially vs bosses without crushing blows such as Rag. Finding a nice combination of mitigation and threat gear + popping a pummeler generates some serious threat. Unfortunately not a lot of gear for ferals from current raids so they will drop off until the late phases. Picks up again around AQ/Naxx and is in contest for beat late-phase threat gen (highly relevant against bosses such as Patchwerk as again no crushing blows)
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
Unless there is an easier, better and more cost effective way to do that thing.
---
My correct
---
Are you trying to justify the use of slurs?
---
The context is irrelevant, a slur is a slur don't use them here.
---
Oh you’re right. Cuz running around on your mount and getting a notification that an apposing faction is nearby is completely skill based. Legit made yourself sound like a moron right there.
---
I wasn't on AQ at the time of the opening. I transfered there in BC and stayed there throughout WOTLK. I just remember my guildies telling me that that's how it happened.
---
That's actual fun to do ;)
---
Well fuck me.. i m on mobile at work. I can take a look when i get home.
---
Do you have a guide how to do it as a priest?
---
Hmmm that's actually the point. It works as intended.
---
Thanks, I have seen this one but since it is from september this is no longer valid?
---
no
---
Either you already get it or you don’t, I’m not gonna be sucked into that convo. The issues are obvious and the only reason it’s not a serious issue is because of how rare it is.
---
shut up, mother
---
The mechanism of addon which provides data for https://wowclassicpopulation.com/ seems to be much better since it gets the /who checks + shows people who are actually online at one given moment of time, not just registered, but playing.
---
yes but i dont care about raid efficiency i want 3% more crit :D
---
That's not how spy works...
---
Doing this while saying you're serious about PvP is a yikes. You're not serious about pvp, you're serious about grinding honor. I for one can't see how this would be effective. It's just the horde way I guess.
---
Currently all signs point to yes
---
Can you avoid aggroing anything that way?
---
Spoken like a true corpse camper stuck bellow rank 6
---
the number of warlocks who somehow mess up casting shadowbolt amazes me all the time
---
I play a warlock.
---
First, you're talking affliction spec... which now that I'm 60, I'm no longer using. I'm DS/Ruin so that I'm actually viable in a raid.
---
Second, what you're describing literally never happens with me. You just described 3 players that don't sound very good at their classes or the game in general, while you're an expert. Meanwhile I'm average at best, and with my luck I go up against 3 players who are experts.
---
You say it's easy. It is not. It is literally not.
---
Was going to make an enhancement shaman alt until I remembered that pretty much your entire existence is going to be totem twisting and you're never going to be anywhere near the top of the meters, but your melee dps that you're competing with for gear are going to love you.
---
Unfortunately it’s been like this since time was time look at hellfire pen all the high levels camping the level 60s in original classic I do remember not as much group killings but there were a bunch of rouges great group battles at stv and tanaris
---
Streamer privilege fuckin lmao
---
I literally told all my friends to expect shit like this on PvP servers in the current day. 
---
People are way more informed and organized in the current age of gaming. There were never this many level 60's in vanilla, let alone players. Faction imbalance is so much more dramatic.
---
You're*
---
I have between 2 to 6 hours time to play a week. Can't get anything done. I've unsubscribed.
---
Having recently played a bit of my [just] 24 Priest, I don’t know how people do it. The comparison to my 43 rogue is night and day.
---
I think I’m just more suited to the ‘mindlessly tap three or four buttons and not really worry about anything else’ - mentality. I’m not a fan of healing in dungeons. Soloing as shadow is okay, I guess.
---
Which classes are most like this mentality? Besides rogue. I guess hunter? That’s what I mained on vanilla though so was after something different.
---
interesting, thank you. yeah my guild (hardcore raiding guild, 4 raid teams that clear mc in sub-60 minutes) is having a real issue finding feral tanks. i think we have one? and hes mostly random OT/cat dps. according to some guildies its because feral(i guess both tank and dps?) is actually a genuinely difficult spec to play and similar to spriest you have to go full mad lad in raid to be competitive. plus, who the hell wants to go to gnomer period let alone farm there!? gross.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q7p-ihYOG5s
---
Druid tanks have the highest TPS in the game. Due to the fact that maul has a threat multiplier of 175% per damage which stacks with the bear form multiplier of 145% with talents, together it works out to be ~262% threat multiplier, while using pummlers druids attack time is 1.67 and maul hits for roughly 300-400 non crit in decent gear.
---
How does everyone assume the entire player base started reading up on the various detailed assumptions that were made before Classic got released.
---
This might come as a shocker, but some people just figured to buy some game time and relive some adventures of the past.
---
so true, I lost my desire to get to 60 and do not want to start over either
---
Warriors can do mara can't they? A warrior in my guild has been doing it all week.
---
Actually sorry for jugding and forcing my own definitions on you indeed.
---
Well we also have Deadlines. But yeah, that's 2 dungeons compared to RFC, WC, SM, RFK and RFD.
---
2 months of killing ragnaros. my three epics are lionheart helm(crafted) onyxia tooth(not mc) and a weapon.
---
We stared disenchanting the druid epics a while back. It hurts my poor fury heart to see people toss away purple.
---
I’ve had really good luck finding people from the opposing faction willing to 1v1 in random locations. Just got done with a 1.5 hour session vs a pally in WPL, and a couple of days ago I had several fun duels against a mage in Blasted Lands. Major props to the people out there willing to take a few minutes for some real honorable fights.
---
What? How? Also, has any of your links to asmongolds crap ever gotten a single upvote?
---
Or the other scenario is all the casual players quit the game and classic wow brings in less and less income each month resulting in less investment into the game overall. Blizz don't care that classic wow is fun, all they care about is the money.
---
he's level 8 dude
---
Even installing this addon made them better than you though.
---
Its seems like half of people in this thread doesn't even play the game. This is happening everywhere and it will keep happening until BGs. They are not measuring their dicks, they are honor grinding.
---
level 8s are of his power
---
You talk as if its his only content, and its him thats creating it.
---
Quick strike ring is better than tarnished elven ring. Keep in mind you cant get hit cap as a feral cat without using either blackmit bracers or rune of the guard captain (if horde) (and assuming you have accuria)
---
Yep. This is what endgame is about, and what many people like. There is very little actual content in Classic. Retail has tons more.
---
Smolderweb is a pretty solid server atm. Its abt 55:45 horde to alliance ratio but its fairly balanced compared to other servers and has an active high pop with never any queues
---
Honestly, i don't think multiboxing is that rare in classic, since it is so cheap to start. You don't have to buy the game, just create an account and put some gametime on it. I decided myself to try out a trinity team for this very reason, and i saw 3-4 other multibox teams while i was still in Dun Morogh. I stopped at level 20 though, because it simply wasn't that fun for me.
---
They are skull. you are not.
---
We are on kirtonos. Can’t believe someone has that much gold
---
Not if items never drop.
---
Except this wasn't a part of the classic experience, we wanted it changed back to how it was you dolt.
---
Took me a solid 90 minutes from having a full 5 man yesterday to actually starting BRD.
---
I haven't played on pservers and still know how to read a guide for my class....
---
Yes it does?
---
There's pretty much no such thing as a fair fight in WoW PvP so tier lists are pointless. Whoever is more skilled or gets a proper jump will win. Or whoever has more numbers. Yeah, some classes are great at "dueling" but dueling offers no merits in this game.
---
Every class excels at what it is intended to do, and it's up to the player to use it well.
---
Are you stoned? There's a reason top Guilds bring 20 warriors for their 30 minute MC speedclears you know. 
---
Warrior is THE best dps in the game once geared.
---
Warrior is always wanted if you're a tank. Always throughout the levels until 60. Even raiding is easy if you're willing to offtank / DPS when needed.
---
As for the best classes to farm gold, hunter in DM:N tributes and mage in DM:E.
---
Reason I quit playing Classic, atleast for the time being.
---
Molten Core was famously built in a week, and if we're being honest, it shows it.
---
I think in retrospect you can see that AQ had a lot of planning behind it. The whole of southern Kalimdor and Silithus in particular builds up AQ, so I think it's clear there was a lot there from the start.
---
The problem is that retail offer many more tools for rp than classic
---
so what? warriors literally have abilities that have threat modifiers to use every global and heroic strike every auto. i dont understand why you even trying to do this comparison m
---
Just offer PvP to any pve server transfers. The real issue is non-consensual PvP. Not the imbalance.
---
That's raiding life. I killed KT on private server as a mage and had some chronic item issues
---
Bloodcaller main hand from zg lasted me till grobbulus dagger.

Tier 1 gloves lasted me til tier 3 gloves (as that's token based I literally never saw caster gloves drop ever)
---
Tier 1 helm lasted me til onyxia finally dropped tier 2.... 3 days before I got tier 3 helm from thaddius.
---
Meanwhile o got neltharions tier week 1 bwl haha.
---
It's lucky of the draw and that's what keeps it interesting.
---
They aren't balanced, but it's important to understand people were warned about the upcoming imbalance long ago and the actual imbalance is nothing but players' fault (mostly the slightly underrepresented faction transferring en masse to another low-pop server to create a safe haven there for themselves by being an overwhelming faction).
---
Hahaha, my main is a feral tank and those trips to gnomer are pretty lame indeed. Was fully geared in like 3 raids so we decided to add more warriors to tank rotation. Now kinda migrated to rogue (I know - shameless). Still, don’t see many feral tanks either. Might be due to stigma around ferals not being viable (also something I noticed a lot early on)
---
For raiding, mage. You hit frost bolt for the entire fight on rag, probably more fights as well. For PvP they have a lot of options and quite a high skill ceiling I've heard.
---
Oh, is there such inbalance on gehennas or is it just in this video.  
---
Isn't APEX, the top guild there alliance? Think i heard somewhere that like top alliance players hover around 100k honor, while horde supposedly has much more?
---
Here's the thing: hordies can just teleport to Gnomeregan :D
---
While leveling quite a few tanks don't have a gun though, making it much more tempting to let someone else pull, so maybe that breeds a bad habit.
---
We have an actual PVP god in our guild.  Guy has played hard for every WoW expansion, he's been a rogue the entire time.  Knows the class so well he tops to DPS charts even in his PVP specs.
---
He never brags, he never puts people down.  He just whispers pointers to people if he thinks he can help them.  Shoutout to Trese on Herod Horde!
---
Seduce is your friend i dont use any other pet. And i put good numbers with sm ruin not as good as ds ruin but its a 5 percent difference in damage not that bad..thats why i am sm ruin i can pvp decently i rather be soul link but since i do also pve i dont have to pay for respecs. Only thing u lose as sm ruin for pve is upgraded HS and imp and the 5 percent damage. I stay with the ds ruin locks and surpass even during certain fights. Not like pve is hard u sit there spamming shadowbolt pretty boring..
---
Yes!
---
Some time i killed a guy who in past pist me off by canping me for nothing (a skull gnome rogue)
---
Is so satisfying see that he killed me 5 times...and I killed him 28 times.
---
Revange, sweet revange :3
---
Honestly, after level 17 I mainly stuck to dungeons, while questing in some quest-dense zones for the odd level (and always with a group). 
---
Deadmines 17-20, Stockades 20-25, RFK 25-30, SM 30-43, ZF 43-48, Maraudon 48-52, BRD 52-57, and then any other instance after that.
---
All of those listed dungeons (with the exception of maybe Maraudon) are pretty good xp and aoe-farmable. 
---
You also have a lot of rare healer gear from BRD, so farming those while leveling rather than at 60 feels a lot more satisfying.
---
Prob sash of whispered secrets, cant think of anything else.
---
The part of "classic experience" was community using it or not despite given the opportunity to do so in a form of Paranoia.
---
You certainly can make your best effort in convincing community to stop using this addon or you can stop finding excuses for you being bad at this game, you choose.
---
Except some changes have already been made. Simply adding 1000 goblins to guard flight paths or boats doesn't fundamentally change the game from 15 years ago.
---
Essentially, the #nochanges never had a chance of working because if anything, it's the player base that has changed most compared to Vanilla.
---
The Pvp was never good in classic. It was a after thought from blizzard and its so apperant that even a blind man could see it.
---
Still cute how the bottom trash of the community desperatly are trying to defend it because that is all They ever where good at, 5v1 low levels and think They are god tier players.
---
Cant wait for tbc and arenans. So many shit tier pvpers are gonna cry when They cant get past the entry level brackets since They no longer can go 5v1 on Targets killing mobs out in the open
---
That has nothing to do with getting ganked LOL. How long did it take you from TP to BRD.   
---
Why wouldbnt you buy cheapass invisibility potions??? So incredibly easy to just run pass entire groups of players, why do you do exactly, respawn in a middle of a raid spamming /spit to do die 90minutes in a row????
---
Id probably play again if they allowed us to xfer to PVE. I play Horde and on my server (Whitemane) it's just as bad for the Horde as it is for the alliance I keep reading about. Can't even step foot in a contested zone without having a team of night elf rogues gank you and camp you. The big taiwanese guild makes it seem like Horde are greater numbers but they play at such odd hours that I rarely see them when I get to play. I leveled 2 toons to 60 before P2 no problem with some minor pvp here and there, it's nearly impossible to do anything but corpse run to dungeons now. My fiancee straight refuses to play the characters we started together, she and I are playing retail now unfortunately. She only gets 1-2 hours to play every few days, before P2 it was fine, now we can barely step foot outside Hammerfall/STV without being ganked and camped.
---
But there are no black lotus in silithus?
---
Check where people are before inviting them then, inst ad of acting like an impatient child, in a game where everything takes a forever to do.
---
&gt;They were also atrociously biased in favor of the Horde.
---
Sure, that why they put Stormwind next to the most important raid hub in classic.  
---
"We love Horde More! Lets make them travel 15 mins every time they want to do BRD/LBRS/UBRS/MC/BWL"  
---
Ye sure...
---
dont thundercrap!! everyone will know you're a noobtank
---
Its all about luck and funneling gear to the people that need it. If you're in a tryhard guild you're most likly gonna get lootcounciled gear, if you're using DKP you're gonna get it eventually. 
---
Classic WoW is like Diablo 3. The whole point of the endgame is to grind and grind and grind untill you're done.
---
Same on my server (Razorgore EU). I imagine the Horde just start shaking uncontrollably if a group of 10+ Alliance dare to try and fight back. I imagine they spam every chat channel or something as within 30 mins you'll have multiple full raids coming
---
pummeler is needed for their threat gen to be higher than a warriors though right? i think that may be the issue then, people just dont wanna farm gnomer for a bunch of em before every single raid lol. i'd hate that. so technically, druids are better at threat gen but they gotta do ridiculous stuff to be able to do that. gotcha, thank you
---
This exact thing is why we have personal loot in retail. But cause you can in fact go years and never get your desired item.
---
But then you'd be donating in order to do that shit. Why don't people, i dont know, just stop watching the guy and be done with it
---
Yeah good luck getting a weapon thats not a wrench as druid. Thats the one piece where the competition is fierce even for us :D
---
Yes they have ;)
---
So you don't consider the current situation to be tremendously disruptive to a large amount of players?
---
Also whether your talking max players at peak times, active server population in the last 14 days or total number of characters the proportion is still 3-4 times what was the maximum server pop in vanilla. So saying it's online at one time doesn't change anything.
---
I also think that twink gear is in a bubble. Some of the pvp consumables like Free action potion was definitely in a bubble. They went for 2g before phase 2 on my server, and when phase 2 hit, and everyone started dumping them, the supply was higher than the demand, so the price dropped to 1-1.2g and havent gone up since. 
---
I think we will see the same with Black lotus. Black lotus is in a huge bubble on Firemaw, going for around 90g each and almost no one is using them, everyone is hoarding. I think supply will be higher than demand once BWL releases.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
Its Addon...
---
Selling 20 copper bars for 87s? Of course someone with TSM is gonna snipe it ans resell if for 2x as much.
---
No problem go on malding.
---
This only shows the flight path gank.
---
Getting to the boat itself : 2-3 additional deaths.
---
On the boat : 2 deaths.
---
Since you get killed on the boat, you need to quickly rez and run to the port before the boat leaves else it will rez you again just so you can die again. Alternatively, you can take a rez sickness to skip that risk. You'll probably die 2-3 times running to the flight master.
---
All in all, you easily lose 30 minutes and die 6-10 times changing continent.
---
And then when people who rolled on PvE servers asks for BGs with phase 2 they go "you know BGs wouldn't come until phase 3! If you wanted pvp you should have rolled on a PvP server!"
---
Only if the items drop! We've had maybe 4 Cenarion drops in 3 MC raids. Our last raid was full of rogue and warlock loot.
---
It's just how it's done. PvPers need to farm as much honor as possible because they are competing against their own faction. They could look up fair fights but that would just severely limit their honor while boosting those who camp the flightmasters. 
---
This is just how PvP and without battlegrounds is and nobody likes it. I'm fairly certain that Blizzard only implemented it like this to shut up some of the overly rose tinted guys who claimed vanilla wPvP was the shit. It wasn't. It wasn't back then it isn't now. BGs the 10th will end this tactic immediately.
---
The game just replaces what you type with a predefined 'word' that matches the letter number.
---
single letters are replaced with another single letter, so it's possible to write sentences by spacing them. But not every letter is available so you can't say everything you want.
---
It's great if you are arms spec Ed and got sweeping strike. Best aoe opening as a warrior you can get. Otherwise, meh, I only use it when I want to dps more.
---
I'd drop mining instead of herbalism. The demand on herbs will skyrocket with the release of BWL. You can always sell herbs and buy ores.
---
DM:N tribute solo is the best moneymaker in the game. If you learn it, respec for it, and tolerate the failure rate, you can make 500g+ per day.
---
I personally had someone teach it to me and run me through it repeatedly for 3 hours so I can cement it in my memory.
---
A word of warning, though. This run is exhausting mentally. You have to be focused on the game and paying attention. Mistakes can happen and you have to adapt. So this is absolutely not a brainless farm like mining or herbalism. It's something you actively do.
---
hell yeah. just like a mage on my server that walks around org with a krol blade. style, baby.
---
I would far, far rather this than the loot crate bs in retail.
---
0 ingots in 2 months is incredibly unlucky. I feel for you
---
My current guild has got a mageblade every time we go MC...
---
This is just star wars with shitty WoW items photoshopped badly onto it and related subtitles
---
That site is just showing raiders that actually use logs. Its in no way shape or form accurate.b
---
Yeah that’s because they played the game more and better than you.
---
i got mine krol blade for 320g for my rogue reroll and i dont regret it especially since i could use it for leveling. zeal is another good choice, so if you prefer to buy your weapon off the AH then buy whatever is cheaper on your realm.
---
People are so fucking weird init
---
Yeah of course, but this was still possible to abuse by a select few tryhards even with smaller servers. All it takes is one level 60 horde to grief leveling players in Menethil. The rest is just overkill.
---
Or I can be totally content because spy got nerfed into the ground :)
---
Best part of this clip is that they were honorless.
---
recipe is like 250g on herod atm, more that I just want to be able to make it, rather than have it be useful.  
---
didn't know it didn't stack with fort,but then again sages doesn't stack with AI either so alch seems kinda fucked atm.
---
Its almost like servers have different prices for items and this is the 3 day average price. HMMMM
---
resistance fights like someone else said
---
would be good for a meme build with all the "when struck in combat deals X damage to attackers" items you can get. i wonder what the max you can get heh
---
Swing and a miss
---
I farm 10 for every MC, the 33% drop rate makes it quite easy. I do tank every boss because of the threat I produce so I'm happy doing it for the guild. You don't need to have them on alot of bosses though, depends on your raids dps.
---
Very original, these are the people who whine xDD No wonder they cant buy a simple invisibility potion
---
Healer here who was a tank once upon a time. The two things I think, and I don’t know if what I think is right, but good tanks are about two things: gear and organization. The first is unavoidable, good gear makes you live longer and absorb more damage at slower rates. The second is about organizing the group so that you are the only one taking damage in an ideal world. 
---
Not enough tanks put up markers to address kill priorities. Not enough give constructive feedback but instead stay silent until they are yelling at someone about something they have been doing the whole time. And lastly not enough know the mechanics. Nobody starts with these skills and they are some times not easy to learn. I think that’s the difference in a great tank from one that is fine where I’ll be drinking after every pull because I was healing three party members at once, two of whom are not geared to be able to take damage well.
---
why :(
---
Yea man, we all feel it, watch so many Druids running around full t1/2 saying how they got geared so easily... I’ve been in about 4 weeks of the only Druid in raid and have had gloves drop.  And thats it...  raiding 6 weeks full clears and I’m 3/8 and haven’t seen t2 drop once...  I’m hoping when bwl drops luck will change and I’ll full t3 in the first week :p
---
30 FPS. You hate to See it
---
Killing someone on a PvP server in a video game is "harassment" now? I guarantee you if the tables were flipped and Asmongold camped Advertise all day long, nothing would happen.  
---
This sets a very dangerous precedent where big streamers can deplatform those they simply dislike by crying their eyes out.
---
Maybe she was adopted by human family
---
False though. Needs 2 accounts and the name change character must be under level 30.
---
You must learn the ways of World of Roguecraft.
---
Spotify hates your Spotify playlist.
---
I had 160 gold when I hit 40, bought my mount right away and at 45 I had over 100G again. Money trickles in fast in the higher levels.
---
somthing somthing 3 day average somthing somthing servers have different prices
---
Maybe you are correct with what you are saying. I dont see AQ realm listed on https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_scepter_holders_by_server
---
So maybe i attended the automated opening of AQ. But then i dont understand how someone got the scarab lord title.
---
Is there any way to make it work as a warrior priest combination?
---
Well done! Took a while :) Ended up scanning the whole image, zooming in more each lap around. Great work with the lighting effect on him, thought his texture would stand out more.
---
His probability to have not seen it is: 0.8\\\^13 = 0.0549755814
---
So his probability to have it seen is: 0.945024419
---
I don't know what math he was using as well.
---
Rogues is much more fun than warriors in PvP. They're a lot more fun to play and they have a lot more tools to frustrate the enemy.
---
If you wanna tank, go for it. Why be intimidated? Just tell your group it's your first time. If the group gets fussy, you can either get feedback if you're doing something wrong, or you can leave and find another group if they're just being stupid.
---
I'm not disputing they can probably get more at some point, but I got plenty on a single raid one of the first nights, it was quite balanced.  You might make a little less doing raids, but there's the added bonus of not being a dick.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's\_fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_fallacy)
---
I used to do this with my old guild mates in ashenvale we would set up a raid party and just destroy the alliance in the center most town. It got so bad that skeletons covered almost the entirety of the ground.  3 hours of madness, I still have fond memories of those times playing vanilla wow.
---
There are discords for each class (for example linked on the classic wow discord) and at least the warlock one has some good information for pvp. I'd think the hunter one is the same.
---
**Gambler's fallacy**
---
The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future (or vice versa). In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of independent trials of a random process, this belief is false. The fallacy can arise in many situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where it is common among players.
---
The term "Monte Carlo fallacy" originates from the best known example of the phenomenon, which occurred in the Monte Carlo Casino in 1913.

---
Also, not to forget that Badlands (ore and elementals) is one of, of not the best farming zone in the game and Swamp of sorrows is the best zone for leveling herbs... both horde zones.
---
A person who's entire content is based on another person lol, yikes
---
Kinda is right now.
---
The lower range means the rogue stealthed within 50 yards. That's a pretty damn low range to check.
---
maybe this person is playing as a night elf bro lol
---
i know hindsight is 2020 but you really screwed the pooch on that one. i think you woulda stayed on the server if you had a 60 or two (sounds like 2, if you had a 46, 50 and 55, unless you put all your time into one 60). you're missing out on like, 80% if not more of the "good" stuff classic has to offer by not playing a max level, and especially leveling 48+ when phase 2 is out.
---
glad you re-rolled and seem to be enjoying it but its just a shame you didn't get to really experience the game on a pvp server. to each their own but PvE servers seem so bleh and boring to me, just raid log and farm? no thanks
---
Is it really that bad? I haven't played in like two months.
---
quick question: how much Spellpower do you have? Just wondering if there's a minimum SP required so that you can kill stuff before going OOM. Haven't had a chance to test it yet myself.
---
1 time vs 50 times, use ur brain?
---
Press V for god sakes
---
not one 60 but TWO? unless the reason was massive faction imbalance that is just insane. or its someone who should have never rolled on a pvp server period.
---
I still never understood why people liked Oddjob.  My circle of friends stopped using him entirely because his head is right at default gun-level.
---
I stuck with Baron Samedi.
---
Drunkloser!! It’s Thalnir. I will avenge you, Gnome!
---
How would an instant(and i assume forced) server merge work with duplicate character names?
---
What are some good dungeons to grind a few levels, for a 50 rogue? Kind of sick of questing.
---
I'm contemplating it based on server balance in addition to community. I'm horde on a horde dominated server and it is not fun in the world.
---
To be honest, I have a lot more fun in PVE than I do most PVP encounters.
---
PVE isn't boring, it's exciting.
---
PVP is fun sometimes... other times I just have no chance to do literally anything what so ever which is zero fun. Rogues preventing me from doing literally anything? That's not fun. Palladins and priests immune, resisting or reflecting anything I try to use? That's not fun. It'd be one thing if these stuns or shields were quick, or if I could counter them somehow... but they're not and I can't.
---
https://discord.gg/M2hn62w
---
i think you're thinking of the other arch under lbrs
---
We have zero
---
yep theres a couple shaman and a couple mage multiboxers on my server that we regularly farm for honor.
---
Why? Targeted harrassment is against TOS on both server types.
---
You are going to erase that character and start from scratch because transfer from PVP to PVE is never going to happen. 
---
Next time think about how much you like PVP before rolling.
---
Nothing about Vanilla/Classic was ever meant to be fair.  It's why classes aren't balanced.
---
&gt;! spoiler only requires "&gt;!" on the right side.
---
Name checks out tbh.
---
You really seem to be a unnice Person. Congrats on that. I hope you are only that way on the Internet :P
---
When People say they get ganked for 90mins until they reach BRM it is probably true.
---
You - Mr Hintsight - ofc know everything better and constantly have plenty of invis potions stacked.
---
When you got ganked 6 times and already have a 2min CD on rezzing you are not gonna go back to get some invis potions. It is too late by then.
---
Also - why can People not complain and whine? Is it because YOU 
---
&gt;the vast minority 
---
cannot take it?
---
Damn don't come to reddit if it hurts you to much xD It is like People whining about pvp on a pvp Server. Just get over it wtf
---
Literally the most useless post among them all. TY for that xD
---
Its a character hes playing
---
Ok :) I guess I just have to keep trying, it's a good exercise in patience.
---
Log in your spy alts to make sure you outnumber your enemy who are now stuck in queue because everyone likes being stuck in a queue.
---
Vis'kag is better in every conceivable way and is way easier to get.  Sell Teebu's
---
Its also bad for PvE as it takes up a debuff slot for something utterly useless. I know its pre-raid bis, but I never got why rogues dont go swords until they get Gutgore, CHT or Perditions from MC.
---
Grats, you got awful items. Preraid items are pretty much better than raid items with a few exceptions. The cenarion set is so bad that you shouldnt really use ANY pieces of it. An argument could be made, that the shoulders are \*decent\* but thats about it. Staff of dominence is indeed pretty damn awesome for restos and laser turkeys and so is manacord belt. Apart from that? You got t2 leggings and t2 hat. There ya go, rest is blue.
---
Thanks! I will keep trying. Getting to know some nice people like this.
---
The amount of research people expect others to have done on a video game is hilarious.
---
Uhhh my dude, I was agreeing with you and talking about the idiot that will post one here. You dumb or something?
---
Yes, you have a point, I should probably work on that Ony attunement as well to get the sinew.
---
Go prot. You can level as prot without losing much speed, and you can tank which is awesome.
---
Your kill efficiency will increase much faster as prot than ret. Especially when you get access to BoS and HS (after getting cons, so around ), then you can just grind an entire area of undead in a couple of pulls.
---
Paladins are super boring to level as ret imho. And at this time you won't be finding as many dungeons as the launch period. So try prot. Icy Veins has a good guide.
---
Pick cons first to be able to tank dungeons.
---
I’ve seen it in the wild on ZT. There seems to be a regular NE thing in Ashenvale, which wasn’t exclusive to guild members, and there’s always random encounters in Stormwind.
---
Wasn't that Cataclysm? (not sure, main Horde)
---
&gt; If you are a priest and using greater heal and flash heals....you are not playing correctly.
---
That depends on how you play. Flash heal is my main heal, but i play to improve my healing score on warcraft logs, so i pretty much aim to hit 0 mana by the end of each kill. I could be safer and play more mana efficiently, but that isn't fun, since MC is such a walkover.
---
Sure, Blizz is horde biased, that's why 90% of PvE endgame Content in phase 1-4 is right next to Stormwind. Its so convenient for horde to fly 15 mins every time you want to do anything in Black Rock
---
Are you sure? like 100% sure? I tried to searing pain her last night and I swore I saw an IMMUNE pop up
---
After nerf: oh boy there's a rogue running towards me that I see in range. Oh boy he disappeared! "Spy: roguename has stealthed"
---
Our first benediction went to a spriest
---
One of the first things I saw was the naked troll woman. Why my voodoo hard..
---
He’s paying for 10 accounts, hardly unfair
---
&gt;So you don't consider the current situation to be tremendously disruptive to a large amount of players?
---
I definitely don't but you might want to define "large". The whole situation happens, if anything, because they are minority (and they were warned about it), and with playerbase as large as current classic playerbase, unhappy people are bound to emerge here or there: Blizzard can't satisfy all so they will listen to the majority which doesn't have to be vocal, they have just to play the game and keep their subscriptions active.
---
&gt;Also whether your talking max players at peak times, active server population in the last 14 days or total number of characters the proportion is still 3-4 times what was the maximum server pop in vanilla. 
---
Any data supporting this please?
---
btw bwl is tier 2.
---
It took me around 20 runs to get it bit only because a rogue rolled higher than me on run 3 or so. Just keep on going UD it will drop eventually.
---
You should ask in /r/BattlefieldV ;-)
---
It is an argument and an illogical one. Thats like calling a cop a murderer who shoots and kill a murderer. Its a stupid statement that doesnt prompt any sort of conversation. U need to google what argument means, its not a word with a single meaning.
---
Got a gutgore ripper on my first run.  3 other rogues and none of them wanted it.  All combat rogues on a pve server.  We have seen zero weapons since that run...i cant wait for bgs ;)
---
People misusing "ban" and "suspension" annoys me to no end.  Bans are indefinite, suspensions are temporary.  If your access is removed for a set period of time, you're suspended.  If your access is removed permanently, or with no set time - you're banned.
---
My shaman just turned 50. I respecced to ele at 41 and went sort of crazy twinking it. I am blasting shit left and right so quick my BiS lvl 50 warrior buddy with flurry axe and trash blade cant even compete with me, even if i give him windfury...
---
I get to do about 5-6 mobs depending on crits/clearcasts/EM CD per time i gotta sit down. Without crits, totem, shocks etc i do 270 DPS in pure LB spam.
---
Ele shaman is a pure joy to play.
---
Guy post enjoyment and findings of 35hrs of work.  Reddit : This Is a horrible way to make money... 
---
Play the game you want to play it!
---
thats a higher droprate than I expected. the shitty part is probably having to wait for reset, huh? so 2 hours if you get perfect drops, prob more like 3-4 though? 
---
is feral tank spec a lot different from feral dps spec? curious if on fights where you DPS instead of tank if your DPS is curbed because you are "tank" spec or not
---
there's a comprehensive article on [WoW head Classic](https://classic.wowhead.com/search?q=shaman+tank) that goes into detail about Shaman tanking raids.
---
&gt;its mathematically impossible so no, its not true.
---
You Need to redo your math because it is obv. wrong. Show you calculation please.
---
&gt;You dont have a 2min ress after 6 death, nice hyperbole again
---
Prove me wrong :O I'm quite sure that you do. That doesn't take away that you do have a 2min rezz timer. Even though you have to run. The run is most of the time even longer than 2min so it very well can take 90min to get into BRD.
---
Obviously you have tested it all on each Server you nolifer xD I just love when stupid People think they are smart :P You whole post is a shitshow and you arguments are simply wrong. You just write stuff without any context :O
---
And yes. You do Q.Q quite a lot - who has hurt you? Did your GF leave you? Did you loose your Job? 
---
Why are you so mad? I really want to get behind it :3
---
Please just delete your post. It is simply stupid like all the other whiner Posts. Why are you allowed to spread salt everywhere and others are not? Are you a Special Person? Probably are but in another way xD
---
Ah I see you don’t like yourself then. Typical emo sad boy response.
---
But he will award less honor per kill. After a few kills thats no honor or almost no honor.
---
Taking in consideration that they already barely get honor on the first kill because they Tag him with 4 people, that is neither worth the time nor is it efficient in any way. 
---
Those people are actually what is so frustrating about P2, it wouldn't annoy me half as much if it would actually have some Form of sense to it.
---
Yup! 10+ min queue vs “what’s a queue?”
---
we used to have one in our raid guild in Vanilla, if played right they are about mid to low top on DPS meters and they also boost a caster groups dps, if played bad they are below tanks and always oom, moonkin isn't useless just hard to do right and they will need on cloth as it is miles better than any leather out there for them
---
The boomie can pull decent numbers if he doesnt suck at gearing himself. He also wont go oom as the meme otherwise suggest.
---
But doing someone means paying an employee, it must be really hard for blizzard to decide.
---
&gt; Everyone is so much better at the game than they were in vanilla.
---
&gt; 
---
And on top of that, people have better computers today which helps a lot. I remember some people had to mind their camera angle on some fights to reduce insane FPS drops.
---
&gt; Also alliance has better planned citys
---
Did you try to play in Stormwind or Darnassus? There's only one forge in SW, in farthest corner of Dwarven district. It's at max possible distance from Bank and AH, so good luck leveling BS/Engi there)  
---
And general city design with walls, gates, channels and bridges create a maze that make you hate this place.  
---
Darnassus have much better city design, but here comes few flaws that completely negate this - it doesn't even have a forge. Plus AH is very far away from nearest mailbox and Bank.  
---
This is the reason why majority of all Alliance players hang in Ironforge.
---
Im stupid sorry :D Im on a defence mode right now with all the replies, im sorry bud, and thats indeed whats happening. Nothing more stupid than the "bUt U wHiNe AbOuT wHiNeRs"
---
From what I read on here on many servers the faction inbalance is that bad plus it will only get worse especially if the rumour is true and they open up PVP to PVE transfers.
---
Warrior have a lot of pitfalls in the form of straight up bad abilities like heroic strike, rend and thunderclap which, besides heroic strike, shouldnt be used, while the good taking abilities arent obvious since they do no or almost no damage, revenge, sunder, bshout, demoshout.
---
If they pick the fight then fair goes out the window. 
---
Back when Cata was a thing people would sometimes pick fights with me and would be surprised when I popped Wolves and Bloodlust, but if I'm just trying to get my dailies done and I'm still in my PvE gear then sportsmanship can go fuck itself right alongside them.
---
One particularly gratifying moment was the time I was doing Firelands dailies and got jumped by a Feral druid, who then saw the damage I was putting down and tried to Dash away only to realize my wolves were faster than him and he was running into a peninsula...
---
I blame Ally.  They all transfered to a handful of Ally dominated servers.  Upwards of 80% Ally.  No Horde dominated server comes close to that.  Our server was perfectly balanced but ally ran and now it's 65:35.
---
yeah I wonder what the lack of druids is all about. i'm sure its a few things, the whole people thinking they were bad tanks being one of em. personally i just feel like the class isn't "fun" to play, it got "fun" in bc/maybe wotlk(along with a lot of classes/specs). i played resto druid in wotlk and loved it mostly for the spells that came post-classic. 
---
it also seems like they are pretty damn rough to play in PvP, although WSG will be good for them.
---
So you switched from bis items to the worst set items just because they are purple? The only useful item is the staff of dominance.
---
That's a lot of points though, you have to drop all PVP talents for that (shadow without silence lol).
---
In the context you used it, there is literally only one meaning for it. That person didn't provide any reasons to believe it, so it's not an argument.
---
&gt; For our last two MC raids we had a player getting feared there too, but the pathing made them end up under the lava. They got kicked out of the game and every time they logged back in, they got kicked out again immediately. I think they had to use the support on the website to get themselves unstuck
---
Yeh lol this happened to me also.
---
Thats what you get for having a ui like that.
---
Haha it would be an Argument if it was in any context. He literally just stated a fact xD
---
Go to pre-School again bro. It was too Long ago I guess. at some Point you will understand it too (I hope xDD) 
---
Until then you are free to stop writing to spare us all from becoming stupid
---
We farm Ony since week 2, no deathbringer so far in the raid I was in and 1 deathbringer in the other raid (we do it 2 raids per reset).
---
So yes, that's very likely.
---
was 300+
---
Holy shit, I can remember that death run almost photographically.
---
Oh yea, i found this mystical server where ganking doesnt happen, even tho i play on 2 servers and both factions, just lucky i guess huh? 
---
There is absolutly no way you spend more time dead than alive or you are doing something terribly wrong. Literally just spawning in the middle of raids.
---
I'd say it's about right considering it's a moment core item. While the stats are bad, the top end damage is the highest of any weapon before naxx, even higher than rank 14 weapons.
---
Incorrect, there are about 9 spawn points.
---
Back in vanilla, my horde guild had a super dedicated mt. He had close to 100% raid attendance.  
---
After a while, most mains had everything they needed for from MC, and our weekly MC turned into a mix of a few mains, some new members, a bunch of alts and some non-guildies to fill the spots. Main tank still showed up every time. Only drop he could use was bindings. Never dropped.
---
Our MC clear #40-something was the first one MT skipped, he was at his sister's wedding. Both bindings dropped.  
---
That's part of classic. Maybe today, maybe never.
---
Baron Rivendare, Darkmaster Gandling and General Drakkisath will not drop the Dungeon Set pieces of the opposite factions.
---
The other Dungeon set pieces can all drop for both sides.
---
Organized guilds have a lot of lvl 20 locks in place to summon immediately when kazzak goes up.
---
If you give Druid staff before dps casters ouch
---
Ah okay my bad. I just tried to interpret it from what I thought he was saying at the end
---
Maul is multiplicative in threat. Plus talents means that bears have the highest TPS all classic. Throw in a manual crowd pummeler and their TPS mental.
---
This has been announced many times for people who are crying over not getting loot. If you want to game where you hoard loot go to retail (and no this is not "go to retail noob thing", just real fact) or in other game like Diablo. Classic is not loot collecting game. Being in raids is mostly fun way to spend time with cool dudes and dudettes. If your only goal in raid is to get gear then Classic raiding is not for you.
---
Voulez vouz couch avec Moi se soir Clyde?
---
I'd presume vanilla, tbc and wotlk were all envisioned from the start. Cata+ definitely feels like a different era and we know a lot of the original dev team was moved on to different projects during wotlk's development.
---
&gt; I’ve been going here every day since about a week before launch and I never saw any poll asking for opinions. Plenty of threads about how not allowing memes is stupid though.
---
&gt; As someone who goes here at work a lot I can tell you my enjoyment of the sub lately has gone down a lot now that most everything seems to be a repost (even if it’s OC, it’s the my first time clearing MC; so proud, met a friend from 15 years ago and we cried when we saw each other etc).
---
&gt; The memes definitely made this sub a lot of fun when it first launched before everything got banned. If you wanted to make this a repository of helpful posts like some kind of knowledge base I’d get it, but there are already so many of those, and the wow forums are locked down meme wise, so Reddit has the potential to corner a non existent market which is fun to boot. Instead it’s a circle jerk of reposted ‘OC’ screenshots.
---
They're a short term satisfaction but a long term hindrance imo.
---
LOL 
---
Now you whine about whiners whining about you whining about whiners?
---
That is some inception shit
---
This is a really cool opportunity to explain some statistics that are often misunderstood in this game! Hang on tight, it's not so hard.
---
Like others have said, when the dropchance is 20% it is always 20% pr. run which means that there will never be a guarantee that you will see it drop.
---
*However*, you CAN ask "how unlucky am I that I have never seen it drop after 13 runs?". 
---
The answer is that this happens to about 5.5% of players farming this item which means that you are quite unlucky in my opinion.
---
There's a handy formular to calculate it: 
---
    1 - ( ( 1 - x ) ^ y )
---
where 
---
    x = drop chance in decimals. I.e.: 20% is written as 0.2
---
    y = Number of attempts. 
---
This formular answers the question "How likely is it to see an item with x dropchance drop AT LEAST ONCE after y attempts?" 
---
In your case it's 
---
    1-((1-0.2)^13) = 0.945
---
which means that if you imagine an infinite amount of players who are all running Strat UD exactly 13 times, then 94.5% of those will have seen the Carapace Spine Crossbow drop *at least* once. The rest of them, (1 - 0.945 = 0.055) which is 5.5% of them, will never have seen it drop.
---
Bear makes more threat than prot or fury, what are you talking about?
---
Oh. Good to know, thank you.
---
I (officer of gravediggers) try to get the other guilds (and the pvpers from here....) to help but everyone just says it's impossible so time to reroll?
---
It is rather niche - it is extremely good on fights where you really clump and there's constant raid damage on and around the tanks/melees you are healing, but it does not seem to be a smart heal in the same sense that CH is. Also not sure about the "jump" range.
---
This was a pretty established thing in vanilla, so I guess that would be #nochanges.
---
Ahhha so you have a lot of contact with emo sad Boys then? Is that what you get off of? :P
---
Typical boomer Response who still lives in 2003 xD
---
"emo sad Boy" is that supposed to be funny? hurtful?
---
All it does is make you look stupid really :D :D :D
---
There's guild rp on zt atleast
---
Lol that's so cute, it shows you haven't played horde at all. On Herod there is a 80% chance that when taking a zeppelin from Org to STV that you will be ganked by a Druid and 3 rogues ON THE FLIGHT. Of course that's after you zone into STV. Have you ever died on a zeppelin? Try running back to your corpse from the Nessingwary grave yard. I'll give you a tip, it's impossible. Do you know what happens when you don't make it back to your corpse? The Zeppelin auto resurrects you when it zones back into Org and you get ganked again. Rinse and repeat until you're able to jump off the side and HOPEFULLY it's the zone you're looking to travel to. So no, boats aren't safer they're both death traps. The end.
---
Well of course it's better, no one is arguing that. But it's not like you are farming either. You take what you get in a raid.
---
I just don't think it's so great to have 10k. There's really not a lot worth buying in the game for a single person. If it was a guild and you could forever deck everyone with consumables, that would be cool of course
---
Are there no "dishonorable kills"?
---
Advertise is a good guy. Asmon drew his attention by asserting himself the god of PvP, the owner of the server and that no horde could stop him or his guild(s). Points that have been proven wrong many times with and without Addy.  We in the guild DOGZ with Addy appreciate him and don't believe for a minute that people like Asmon and esfand do not use the same tactics to find Addy or Venruki , Cdew or any other horde streamer of which there are quite a few. We just don't whine about it.
---
Cry more
---
A way around this problem (for weapons at least) is going for a 2h.
---
I play the Fury 2h slam spec and I got prio on BRE and OEB (luckily BRE dropped first). This way I got a good weapon and the queue for 1h swords got shorter.
---
Why not?
---
And there's always shit going on in uc/org
---
My math is correct, anyone with half a brain would realize its obvious hyperbole, i guess not for you tho :D :D 
---
Prove you wrong that you dont get 2min CD after 6 death, like are you even fuckin playing this game?!?!? 
---
So if the run takes longer than 2min, why do you whine about respawn timer? Hahahahahah holy shit you make 0 sense :D :D :D
---
The rest is some cringe city shit.
---
Like?
---
Just saying, lesser invis pots won't do anything. And if you haven't died more than 3 times in BRM that likely means either your server is insanely one sided, is semi dead, or no one farms BRM.         
---
If my groups sitting at the bottom near MC entrance it's normally around 3 deaths for a single person, sometimes 2. Now there's also going to be multiple groups sitting at the searing gorge or bs entrance. So add an extra ~2 deaths per group.
---
Burning Stepps takes longer. Trust me, I tried.
---
Is dual wielding Thrash Blade and Flurry Axe as a level 49 twink good or just a bit of a meme?
---
Only if you stand close to where they're standing.  Just like in game.
---
As a hunter, your cons don't ring true at all.
---
Hunter has no stigma for groups. That's just subreddit BS. You'll make some mistakes, but who won't?
---
It's an amazing class. And the pet feeding and ammo are just part of the immersion. Rogues have to carry poisons and other classes have to carry reagents. It's not so bad.
---
And I have to say that we're one of the lowest classes in terms of gear competition. We get mail by default, and our leather pre-BiS is BoE, and our raid bow is literally exclusive to hunters. You're only competing over a couple of rings.
---
Try being a caster for real gear competition.
---
Also, the whole "*guilds only take 1 or 2 hunters to raids*" is false. It may be true in the top of the top of speedrunning guilds, but the majority of guilds bring more than 2. My guild has 5. Other guilds on the server bring a similar number.
---
I'd advise going for hunters.
---
We also have to decurse and pop the potions! It's so hard ...
---
YOu the type of guy to call a police officer a murderer when he shoots and kills a murderer.   
---
"lOl U dId SaMe ThInG"
---
You are in the level range for Sunken Temple, but usually nobody want to go there, so finding party to grind would be hard.  
---
Quest for 2 more levels and go into BRD.
---
It takes around 40 minutes and 10+ deaths to get from thorium point to BRD. That's the worst one I think.
---
That's only for killing civilians (NPC's specifically marked as such).
---
Yep, it'd still be better with none but this is acceptable .
---
" He literally just stated a fact xD"
---
Holy shit you are the one who needs a dictionary if you think thats a "fact xD"
---
Lots of whine and "XD" got it.
---
&gt; it just feels sucky to BE the shaman lol
---
We have 1 enchance sham in our raid, he's happy with playing enhance as long as the guild helps him out with dungeons because no PUG will take him, he's been in our guild since raid 1, never missed a raid, always on time. He's been promised Hand of Rag so that will keep him Enhance with Imp WF.

Just stop, your'e embarrassing yourself.
---
Sweet. Gotta get there first though. Easy to level?
---
Buddy, your name is literally Besthealer. Who do you think you're kidding?
---
&gt; It's an easy game, people can probably clear MC with, like, 40 druids or something.
---
It's easy for now, but as content goes on it gets more difficult... Not like retail Mythic Raiding difficult, but at least needs people to think more during certain encounters.
---
just recently hit 60 on my warlock and started to work on my epic mount quest. I keep seeing people selling dreadsteed summons and got a few whispers about it. I'm a but confused about this dont I need to have all the quest completed before I can summon him, or can I just buy one of these summons and save money on the materials cost ?
---
Questline in ferelas, Tanaris, Un'Goro and of Course silithus point to it.
---
As a player who raids w/ my guild we have maybe 3 druids in the whole 40 man.  
---
Can confirm this meme is the truth lmao.
---
The UI is completely separate from the game world. Addons effectively operate in a sandbox. If there's no API or C event for it, it technically doesn't exist to the UI until you move your mouse on it and click it.
---
We just had 6 weeks in a row with zero rogue drops in MC. Since launch we got 1 viskag and 2 brutality blades. Last perditions blade dropped on sept. 25. I have 1k dkp...
---
I did around 60-100 dps more when i changed my barmans to my core hound tooth. 
---
I think i made an overall bad choice with barmans as weapon speed has been normalized, there are many better daggers than barmans even before MC.
---
Yeah arena will solve for this issue, but i suspect the tendies will go flying if it's released
---
How tf did you did it so fast
---
Wanted to write a long reply but i just gleaned over your post history and noticed you're in Olympus and how writing how asmon is a nice guy. 
---
Stopped giving this topic another thought. You do you. Have fun watching asmon in the future.
---
No its literally an argument because he didnt talk about the topic at hand, and just made an argumentum ad hominem statement to get a reaction out of OP, me.   
---
its hillarious to me, there is 100000 whine threads on this subreddit 99% is LITERALLY whining. Then one person complains about seeing only negative bullshit posts on this subreddit then suddenly  
---
"lOl u AlSo WhInE"
---
&gt; “hate speech” as hate speech trumps free speech every time now and to continue to use it will see you deplatformed. 
---
So true, what's sad is that everyone getting offended by everything wouldn't be surprised if "ok boomer" becomes a form of hate speech.

---
1. 1.an exchange of diverging or opposite views, typically a heated or angry one.
---
By the very definition, it is an argument. It's a diverging or opposite view, or using your own choice of word, opinion. 
---
We can argue pointless semantics all day, "whining about whining" is older than this web page and has become overused and a gone from edgy to stale.
---
It's just horde, they are cowards
---
The way I use it is like this:
---
If the target is around 80-90% hp and taking damage, I'll use a normal downranked heal. If their incoming damage still leaves them at around 80-90% after the heal, I'll cast a greater heal next time.
---
I'll also use greater heals when I see someone at around 30-40% hp but I don't suspect that they will take additional damage any time soon. If they are likely to get him again and die within 2,5 sec, then I agree, shield+flash heal is a better idea.
---
It doesnt, nobody is camping burning steppes and you can jump into the lava, now tell me you dont know how to jump without getting damage
---
Are you mentally handicapped or just that in denial?
---
You can always just grind mobs instead of questing.
---
Go to hinterlands and join some of the group's doing Jintha'Alor. Will level you fast.
---
Or kill the turtles in front of the horde outpost there.
---
Yeah, I'll be real. The first month or so of classic I was like this. I hated how every single dungeon group would take 30min-1hour to just get into the dungeon.
---
I got over it though. Now i use the time to socialize and try to spend the time team building.
---
No you do not get DR on a honorless target. So next time this guy gets killed, the hordes who just killed him wil get full honor.
---
Where? Isn't ZT like one of the most balanced PvP server?
---
This R14 system encourages people to play an unhealthy amount of time (5+ hours a day, 7 days a week). As such, there should be a limit on the number of hours a day someone can spend in the battlegrounds (like 2-3 hours is reasonable).
---
Hhahahhaaha no
---
Player versus People on a Player versus People server, I see nothing wrong.
---
&gt; that 3% spell crit isn't worth taking up a raid slot, even if hes in a group with your top casters
---
How can you say 3% spell crit isn't worth taking up a raid slot when I literally cleared MC with 28 people... If someone wants to play Oomkin, there is no such thing as a "Wasted raid slot" the content is incredibly easy and doesn't need min/maxing.
---
From experiance it totally sucks and basically all other daggers are better after weapon speed was normalized.
---
Getting a specific item? No. Getting gear in general? Yes.
---
Every time I do this the Horde just kills me. They have no sense of humor.
---
Wont do anything? Funny how i get multiple times into my instances with 0 death simply because of invis pot and invis engi trinket. People whine and talk shit, and simply dont put time to learn the game LOL.
---
Maybe if there weren’t so many streamer bandwagon servers there would be a little more balance.
---
Who's the tank? Who is the tank!
---
Did they change the windows since yesterday or am I missing something? What's the challenge?
---
Yeah it really looks like your driving and playing, so you are going to get downvoted :(
---
If the character is significantly lower level than you are, yes. 
---
But the numerical odds matter not.
---
Fuck em? Server health is more important than some dude's name.
---
What was that third one?
---
6000 online or so is on streamer server so far. People were warned by Blizzard not to create characters on such realms (we all know there were like 6-7 servers constantly getting warnings) so I hardly doubt anyone is going to listen to their complaints afterwards. 
---
Drastic faction imbalance on the very same servers was mostly created by the people of alliance who chickened out and moved en masse to create safe havens for themselves to be a dominant faction elsewhere: alliance who stayed was doomed. 
---
I don't really have to mention there were warnings about this exact situation of people being camped everywhere: quest locations, flight points, dungeon portals etc. etc. dated several months ago.
---
Reloading UI clears chat as well.
---
Like 6g and the time to lvl a priest a rogue and a mage so you can cast those spells 🐷
---
Honestly with the game in the state it is, I'm not even sure that BGs will fix the problem.
---
If flight path gank squads can farm honor faster and easier than they'd be able to in a fair fight in a bg, will they bother switching? It's going to be heavily reliant on whether BGs give enough honor to massively outweigh the increased difficulty in getting it.
---
We do drastically need to lower realm population though, having 4x the amount of people on servers has the biggest negative effect, it's cool seeing so many people in one place, but the whole point was supposed to be that interacting with a smaller number of people over time increases the amount of serendipitous repeat encounters. Having thousands more in the same server is basically cross-realm play by the back door.
---
Based on your comment you're probably aware of the quote, but there's a saying regarding fiction having to make sense even if reality doesn't (and I don't mean the 'reality is stranger than fiction' quote, but in a way that quote also fits :p).
---
I did for a while, takes a bag slot though.
---
This is correct answer. ToS clearly says you are not allowed to have direct communication with opposite faction. I mean in theory even being on Discord with friend from opposite faction and coordinating stuff that way could lead into punishment if someone can prove it.
---
I love it when my two favorite things in the world cross over:

World of Warcraft...and a man they call Jayne.

SL lock = not dead lock when they can be insanely tanky between 2 vw sacs

You are about to be taken across the world to be ganged in 1 second lmao

Spend time on more important stuff.

He changed twitch accounts? :o
---
Isnt tjis crossbow needed by rogues or warr too? Watch out!
---
I line grinding an item forever, when you actually get it you slam your desk and yell it's great
---
&gt; we could actually distribute the loot instead of disenchanting it.
---
You wanna speak to your RL and tell him to save those items until you can get epic mats from D/Eing
---
Everybody: I fucking hate scammers. they're the fucking worst. OH AND DONT GET ME FUCKING STARTED ON NINJA LOOTERS. \*froths at the mouth\*
---
Also everybody: /shrug it's just a pvp server. stfu get use to it. it's in the game.
---
There are questschains in tanaris, feralas and ungoru crater that build towards it.
---
play high parse high
---
Why did you leave group if you didnt want a budget hearth lol
---
To be fair, once any item becomes soulbound they're all non-refungible.
---
He was trying to fly but can't because a hunter is attacking him?
---
Happened to me yesterday logging at Ungoro cave.  Pala/rogue.  Within 2 seconds I was attacked.  Logged straight away, came back 2 hours later and the same two players were doing it.
---
Still, at least I'm not on a streamer server.  I bet it's SO MUCH WORSE there.
---
What da fuck is your point ?
---
He was an original player of the server. But tbh i cant remember seing him having the title back in vanilla. I have seen screenshots later on in tbc showing it. Could even be transfer and getting it on another realm later on i guess. Heard that it was possible on any new realms that opened even in expansions.
---
Pretty sure it's BIS for dagger rogues and should go to them first. As for fury warriors, whatever has dps numbers on it and matches any +weapon skill you have is good.
---
Heal
---
I never said it did detect stealthed players. Just that now when you get a rogue pop up on Spy you KNOW he's close to you.
---
Look at their listed debuffs. They've been sitting at the flight path long enough to be worth honor points.
---
Honor points are a mechanic of the game, guys. There's gonna be ganking.
---
Most of the mobs would be green, so you'd still get some EXP, just not a lot.
---
T1 is basically healing; t2 adds in some ele
---
Could just offer faction change.
---
Multishot?
---
Alliance on a PvP server, you chose the path.
---
You're unable to LoS before stealthing? Thats news to me
---
If you aren't level 60, buy the mount and get to level 60. Leveling to 60 is the best investment, since you open up much better gold farming techniques at level 60.
---
the best part about this is the horde were all level 15
---
Was about to write a comment about our weekly loot picture, but you covered it in your last sentence. I don't know what it is (we still have like 2-3 druids per raid, minimum) but it happens a lot.
---
One search found me a clip proving it. Stop being so lazy and expecting people to do your research for you because you believe your favourite streamer is infallible
---
Heal should work just fine, generally the more healing done and the slower the spell, the more mana efficient it is until you get to 60 and get a decent bit of +heal.
---
Twitch is the new TV.
---
TV is full of dumbasses.
---
It makes you look like a fuckin 12 year old, thats it.
---
Just say it bugged out, healers use the same excuse if the release with an active SS. :-)
---
What's sad is that if you swap the fractions, that is every time I land now as a 56. Insta dead, insta camped.  It's a wonder I'm not calling allowance low level quest hubs out of pure rage.
---
We had about 9 mages in my last MC raid, and struggled with getting mages to counterspell. 
---
My guess is that a lot of people are just on autopilot and also that some people didn't bother to get any addon letting you see enemy cast bars.
---
While that is true, it will only be stronger if you're in a building, if not I'm pretty sure you'll see him with your eyes.
---
Which is why meters are not a greatmeasure
---
There are so few druids around you should find a spot if you play feral tank and know what you do (and put int he effort to farm your prebis, tanks are always wanted for 5-mens at least), if you want to raid heal might be preferable since tankspots are quite limited in raids and most raids have their tanks already.
---
Or, go hotw Heal/Tank hybrid and have the best of both worlds, people will love you. The only druids that should have it hard to find invites are oomkins\^
---
No, your total DPS is a combination of the DPS from your weapon and your DPS from your 'Attack Power'.
---
Each class has slightly different calculations for Attack Power, but for Hunter's I think each point of Agility grants 2 Ranged Attack Power.
---
If you hover over the attack stats in the Character panel it should tell you what your total DPS is. Check that value with each bow equipped to see the change to your total DPS.
---
Yeah, I don't actively RP, but I had people RP at me and I usually manage to stay in character and have some short fun interaction.
---
Current Situation has nothing to do with pvp
---
why is this a post?
---
For some background on my part;
---
I was a little wary about joining an RP server when Classic launched. I'd heard stories of people walking everywhere and being, shall we say, a little more deep into the roleplay lore than I was either comfortable with or able to provide. 
---
I think the world of Azeroth itself takes itself at the kind of level of seriousness that makes the hardcore roleplaying a little over-done really.
---
But people could do to get a little into character a bit more. I can fully understand to a couple of night elf parents was born a son and they said "Praise Elune, we shall call him... Fartmonster".
---
You know who you are, Fartmonster!
---
I'm not moaning that much really, this post is more something that irks me a little rather than outright destroys my entire experience with the game and since this sub was filling up with "Gank Tales on PvP" I thought I'd throw my oar in from the other side.
---
Set meeting in kargath or any other flier and go together. We are doing fine like this even get some honor usually on the way.
---
This is amazing, I its joyful and painful at the same time
---
Vael has 200k less health than Ragnaros and starts at 30%, so will be in execute range most of the time.
---
Ragnaros dies within 90-120 sec for msot guilds, so Vael is looking like a 60-90sec fight and in vanilla it was generally considered to be a 3min timer
---
Write their names down on a list, form an army and end their miserable lives!
---
/s Camp check !
---
I stopped reading after "  It doesn’t matter what asmon did  "
---
Wait, what?! I thought FP to BR-instance gankchains were a Horde only thing.
---
It blows my mind why you would take part in a discussion about a streamer you don't consider worth watching and his actions on a "shitty" stream you don't even want to watch. Get the F out of here and let the people who want to debate have a debate, how hard is that?
---
Eh it's fine. I'm enjoying the game. And PVE servers still have pvp. Everyone is still ranking up for pvp gear
---
I’d pay to see this.
---
I do wish they had followed through and not introduce RPPvP servers on launch, they should have held off by a couple of weeks.
---
That potion has a 10 min CD.
---
I play on a medium server. We get steamrolled by alliance which xfered from the big servers to us after being steamrolled by horde. 
---
Faction imbalance is definitely a problem.
---
His video had nothing to do with creating an IN at blizzard.
---
Shlonglor used to play warcraft2 on kali and knew a lot of people in the IN clan.  
---
As well as the MMO community being tiny back then and people knowing each other from EQ and a lot of the EQ raiders ending up over at blizzard.
---
I find that those unplanned interactions are usually the funniest.
---
Take 1 horde heavy server
---
Take 1 alliance heavy server
---
Fuse.
---
Are you drinking oil ?
---
I can't speak much for Horde side but there is plenty of RP on alliance side.
---
If you don't have them i recommend getting the addons TotalRP (TRP) and MyRolePlay (MRP). Makes it much easier finding RPers.
---
Some people have the addon but don't RP regardless but that's okay in my opinion. Much RP happens within guilds or groups of friends but generally RPers are a welcoming people unless you're a super weirdo with in your face ERP for example.
---
I dont know exactly what each rank costs but as a standard take the most efficient will be Heal-&gt; Greater heal -&gt; flash heal and last renew/shield. If i were you i would just try different ranks to find out what fits you at each level, it all depends to some extent on your gear
---
&gt;will my damage done be increased by 50%?
---
Depends a bit on the weapon speeds and damage ranges of the weapons, but yeah, you'll get roughly a 50% increase in your white hits. Most of your spells won't increase in damage, and they should make up a chunk of your damage; only your white damage and probably Aimed Shot damage will increase. In all, it will be a bit less than a 50% increase, because things like Scorpid Sting are a part of your total damage and will not be affected by your weapon damage.
---
i swear mc only drops druid gear and warlock gear and both classes end up with “i dont want it its bad”
---
Why not eye [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e29x6z/weapons_for_dual_wield_fury_warriors/)?
---
Yeah mages are pretty easy to level. They have good single target and multi-target damage. And if you get into trouble you can use Polymorph, Frost Nova and Blink to run away.
---
Then there's all the utility they get. Free food/water and teleports.
---
Also you'll be able to provide them with great wands for their level as they're an alt. Having a powerful wand makes levelling super easy.
---
Well mostly asking about raid, but if it's different for dungeon I'd wanna know too. I'm talking about the gear that nobody but the specified class can equip
---
Got more than 4,5K HP with my warlock during raids.
---
Memory is off.
---
Yeah, didn'T even notice p2 hit except for all the 1s2s names
---
My friend bought 50g just for lulz like a month ago. He was asked by the website he bought the gold to put a few cheap item in the in-game trade window. If Blizzard checks the trade he kinda just sold some items and got paid really well. That isn't against ToS and it's harde to prove by Blizzard that real money was exchanged. People who just gives a lot of people hundreds of golds gets banned easily.
---
Oh what is it called?
---
Which means all the toxic try-hard min-maxers will play Horde. Which makes the Alliance the best faction BY FAR.
---
It's called APES, and afaik they have farmed way more than 100k honor. I heard someone mention the numbers, don't remember exactly but ~300k should definitely be possible if they don't regulate it (which would be hard with so much competition).
---
Never ever seen paladin tier drop in our Horde raids. Since he's asking about "raid gear" I'm assuming Ony/MC.
---
Paladins got 2 and 2.5 for PvP Ret and PvE Ret respectively
---
Is your brain made of garbage?
---
Go away
---
Agreed. Most RP that happens in the wild is by people who already know eachother. If you want RP you need to go to SW or IF. Just wait 10 minutes on the main square and you will very likely see people RP there.
---
Zandalar Tribe represent!
---
I think they do care since the faction imbalance makes people quit. They have taken actions, however not even near what is required to fix the issue. I do think it is because they are trying to find some optimal solution since all solutions have pros and cons.
---
Are you doing full rounds in ungoro? Just look on wowhead were rich thorium vein spawns.
---
Tbh I don't think there's anything wrong with a little favoritism in this scenario. 
---
Twitch has a partnered streamer with 30-40k average viewership everyday one one hand, and on the other hand they have a total nobody who decides to set up a stream single-handedly to harass a huge streamer, even going so far as to advertise his stream by title of "Camping ASMON LUL" or similar. 
---
One of the parties they have a lot riding on, both economic wise and brand-wise, and the other party is a toxic nobody. Who would you choose to back up as a company?
---
Make sure u keep your healing spells upgraded.
---
Flash heal is quick but not great on your mana, so prioritise normal heal or  greater heal. 
---
Try not to over heal, when you know how much your heals are healing your tank, try to let him take that much damage before healing so you don’t waste mana. (Situation dependant) 
---
Also wand in between all healing, or when you are oom.
---
Explain you are shadow spec before you start, but that it shouldn’t be a problem as long as you can drink between pulls when needed.
---
Healing is absolutely no problem without healing gear till much later on, but if you have a few spare +healing armour or high spirit/int gear it’s a nice touch
---
You are not supposed to have only one character in classic, you can do the raid once per character. With 3 lvl 60 now, I do MC 3 times a week.
---
I love to have obscure class on our dungeon group! I did one with 4 shamans and it was hilarious totem forest. I had hard time keeping agro since they would slam those Chain Lightnings.
---
Haha the other day i was doing chicken escort and same happened to me 🙂
---
Back in the day I ran a ICC 25 heroic pug group on my alt that was 11/12 with never trying to kill LK heroic since no1 wanted to waste time it was just for the loot. So if people could do that I can't see why they wouldn't manage nearly all classic content.
---
[But they are, 13 spawn points](https://classic.wowhead.com/object=176589/black-lotus)
---
I do see this very unlikely as well but according what reads in their ToS they do have privilege to do so.
---
You dont need 10 of them to get inside a dungeon, 1 is enough.
---
This is just a wild guess.
---
My guild does the opposite. Show up in preBiS, enchanted gear, you'll be high on the gear list
---
Yeah 2-4 is pretty accurate, depends on luck. I generally park my druid outside gnomer and just play an alt while the instance CD ticks down.
---
Yeah the tank spec misses quite a few key talents from dps. the 30% mana reduction on shifts, improved shred, 15% Ferocious bite damage and extra combo points on crit is Pretty much it. I can still pull 300-400 DPS while in tank spec if i power shift and use a pummler. The dps spec doesn't loose as much if it tanks, 15% threat and imp inrage is about it, 10% armour contribute from thick hide isnt that big in MC since it only changes bear form armour from 460% to 506%. Ill link the talent specs.
---

He is winning on resources/gold because he can afford and is willing to pay for 11 accounts (assuming scouts+main). 
---
Id say it is very much unfair to his fellow players, it's basically an indirect pay-to-win scheme.
---
I dont get it? Our warlocks always tank p3. And when we run out of living warlocks, a tank might take over.
---
Where in the TOS? I thought that was removed and is why the mafias can't be busted.
---
You could have just alt+f4 and the timer would have disappeared...
---
Yes i am, multiple times doesnt mean always. Besides when i said 0 death, i also mentioned my engi trinket, so i have 2 invis.
---
Cheers! &lt;3

---
This is a shitty loot council. You should not be rewarding the people who put the least effort into their gear and character over those that put the most just because it's the biggest upgrade. Why it's the biggest upgrade should be included in the decision. 
---
Obviously getting full BiS is a lottery but it's clear when people made the effort.
---
I’ve never had issue with keeping aggro without an MCP. I just sacrificed the armor on Slaghide and evasion from the Pants off of Angerforge and threw on some Devilsaur, along with a Mask of the Unforgiven.
---
Maybe it’s a Horde vs. Ally difference? Not sure. The reduced damage from not having windfury and addition of Salvation has to do a tonne of difference in threat meters.
---
I tried using an MCP on Onyxia, but I got aggro back in three mauls so it felt rather useless.
---
Only time I ever did something like that: I was in Tanaris in /1, looking for dps for ZF. Some rogue whispered me and I invited him, and he was all the way in EK and would take like 20 minutes to get to us based on his location... he had to wait for the boat and shit!
---
Kicked him and told him I was looking for people already in Tanaris. Apparently he had some LFG add on that let him see Tanaris /1. &gt;.&gt;
---
Do you know if non-set healing plate can drop on horde side?
---
I just realised that maybe Stockades was supossed to be just that. It is weird that they didn't make it a lower lvl than Deadmines, as the layout and mechanics of Stockades are incredibly simple and way more beginner friendly than DM. Also, it is located in the major city (just like RFC ;) )
---
Yes you should do this, I have not been running tactical mastery lately.
---
Indeed, I will keep trying :) I think people will start to remember me as "that unlucky hunter who only does strat UD". Hehe.
---
I don't remember any warlock quests in shadowfang keep and I don't remember any warlock quests giving trinkets - quick google search turned up nothing
---
what am I missing??
---
Same actually :P
---
And I am a typical edgy emo sad Boy. As I said. I really am. 
---
And I find it fascinating that you find it funny :P
---
Do you think that People are butt hurt when they are called "gay" when they are actually gay?
---
Are you butthurt when I call you a man in your early 20s? Because you are?
---
Noo - thats why me being an edgy emo sad Boy (you forgot ugly) doesn't hurt me...
---
But you are funny though. Really. Also very harassing which I reported you for but also quite funny. And edgy too. Just like me :P
---
If I count correctly our guild has done 32 full MC clears in classic (running with 3 raids). No accuria band yet. BiS item for arm/fury warriors, cat/bear droods, hunters and rogues. Meanwhile we are selling about 4-5 felheart belts each week while other guilds are still waiting for their first one to drop.
---
LMAO, show me the proof that he did not stream snipe, my gullible little dude ❤
---
Same experience, but switch factions.
---
Point is, it's not a "the other faction does this" problem which is the childish response I often read online. It's that shitty people are also shitty players and only think about their gain.
---
The fail here is for Blizzard in simply not aknowledging this problem. They didn't 15 years ago and they are not doing it now as well. And part of it is due to the #nochanges people that enabled this.
---
Fuck your meta I play for fun
---
The auctioneer addon will give you average prices for items as long as you keep it updated by scanning the AH.
---
Potion lasts 18 sec and has 10 min CD. How does that Cover the fully Horde covered distance from Thorium Point to BRD?
---
This R14 system encourages people to play an unhealthy amount of time (1+ hour a day, 7 days a week). As such, there should be a limit on the number of hours a day someone can spend in the battlegrounds (like 1 hour is reasonable).
---
So a retail baby, like i assumed. Most of you whiners are kids who are used to getting everything on a silver plater without any sort of adversity.
---
... you literally just asked what the meta is.
---
That would be abused to give the oponent DK's
---
Resurected targets should have no HK's value for a bit, just like when landing or zoning.
---
I followed a guild I barely know from Horde Stalagg to Heartseeker and now I want to quit the game
---
I appreciate you guys coming to Org, personally.  We might be outnumbered in our own city usually, but I can just decide to PvP pretty much whenever the hell I want on the spot without having to travel anywhere.  The people that lead our raids come up with weird strats to overcome the imbalance, it's fun.  For instance one day we hid our entire 40 man behind a shop and had a couple people bait two 40 man raids past us and then we wiped them all out in an instant from behind with one huge push.  That kind of stuff makes it worth getting steamrolled from time to time. 
---
I even like the rogues that come solo/a few at a time all hours of the day.  Higher honor gains, and it's like playing hide and seek.  I see this complaining all the time and don't understand why they don't just unflag and go about their business.
---
Your threat is higher than a Prot Warrior regardless of MCP or not if you sacrifice some armor for Hit and Crit gear. Even moreso Alliance side where warriors don’t get Windfury.
---
I have a feeling that changes as gear progresses though.
---
We choose not to waste time with unnecessary kiting.
---
We get at least 3-5 druid epics per run consistently, way more than any other class. Anyone else the same?
---
He literally forgot to mute Asmongold's stream in one of his since deleted twitch VoDs lol
---
To be fair, RP is one of the few things in which Retail has the advantage over Classic.
---
You have a lot more races, a lot more zones, a lot more toys and pets, a lot more transmogs, a lot more updated lore, ...etc.
---
Also, and this is important, RP thrives in periods of content droughts. People are still not done with Classic content to be driven to create their own content through RP. But you can go to Argent Dawn EU or Moonguard US and always find a RP guild (more on Alliance than Horde).
---
Is Anathema not the BIS staff for them? It’s got a tonne of shadow damage
---
I have done it as PvP arms and Fury prot, standard Fury would be optimal.
---
I would raid even if the bosses didn't drop anything because it's one of the most fun activities in the game
---
&gt;  its kind of demotivating to farm herbs all day long to prepare for a  raid which will most likely not have any benefit for me and then do this  each week. 
---
well this is the game, if you don't like it maybe it's not your game
---
We've had 2 in 3 weeks. I thought they were a fairly common drop. How much did you have to buy each ingot for?
---
wait what, how?
---
Ok, trolling obv.
---
18 sec potion with 10 CD, how does that Cover the distance from thorium Point to BRD?
---
WTF?  I can't remember the last boss we did that didn't drop at least one piece of druid T1/T2.
---
Not true. Then you fall down into people wintrading at odd hours of the day. The best way to do this would be say using an alt. So hypothetically you have 9 mains, and one alt. Alt enters the bg, if it's a premade or not who you expect to vs the 9 mains don't join. Rinse repeat until your mains have won every wsg against the team(s) you are trying to wintrade against in the minimum amount of time possible
---
What about the gear that drops? Would it be worth it for that even?
---
He literally forgot to mute Asmongold's stream in one of his since deleted twitch VoDs lol. A vod that twitch presumably saw before it was deleted.
---
it's also pretty common at this point for raids to not have that close to 100% uptime on the 16 debuff limit. People are dropping rag before submerges with several stacks of deep wounds up instead of more armor stripping.
---
Well deserved, filthy rogue! /s
---
No it is not correct, when you enter combat it is highly unlikely all 20 group members will be within 20 yards, and battle shout threat is split while demo shout is not.
---
It's possible.
---
Back in Vanilla I never got Onslaught Girdle from Rag. 
---
For our guild it dropped 3 times over all Rag killd, and I wasn't present for 1 of them, and outbid on 2.
---
Same for Bindings, our guild had zero drops.
---
It states it in the tooltip of add-ons such as auctioneer, aux and TSM.
---
Can see current and recent prices for any given item, as well as vendor values, disenchant values etc, as long as you scan the ah regularly.
---
I use Aux personally.
---
Wow you are a special kind. Also you have to have friends for the last comment which I highly doubt considering your parents eve despise your existence. Also a boomer isn’t someone in there 20s dumb dumb.
---
I mean, just think about the Onyxia chain.
---
Alliance: Epic journey to uncover a dragon among the very throne of the human capital.
---
Horde: Eh, there is a dragon there. Too close to orgrimmar. Kill it.
---
Like, what?
---
Classic endgame is just shit honestly and nowhere near close to retails endgame.
---
Can confirm, our MC tonight had 3 druid tier bracers drop and druid t2 legs off rag.
---
True! Just was interested in RPing in the Classic Lore, and with the original races. Not a great fan of much of the new and the Allied ones. I do RP on Argent Dawn now, having bought BFA today in the Black Friday sale. Thanks for the reply :)
---
Doubt it will ever take 3, but then again, thats the max we ever plan to
---
Damn, your ping level dude
---
Sorry, forgot to mention. Alliance
---
I was expecting a "OK Boomer..."
---
Well yes in my Little mind it does. 
---
There would also be a difference if a cop shoots a murderer or you shoot a murderer isn't there? XD
---
I really don't get what you are trying to get at :O One Person is supposed to do something and one isn't. That does not make sense to you? Wonder who has the Little brain..
---
**Cringe**
---
Only when tanking as arms. Start with a 2h, charge sweeping strikes berserker rage whirlwind defensive stance demo start sunders.
---
Avoid this place as a warlock solo.  Alot of shadow resist and magic immune mobs.
---
Well, try for youself, i used barmans shanker for over a month and i for sure felt it insanely underwhelming.
---
It sucks :)
---
A quest found to the easy of the camp in the south of the barrens (blanking on the name). It gives a staff with increased shadow damage or a trinket with increased shadow damage (I think those are the bonuses). I’ve seen it on wow head before
---
Yes exactly I started with retail in Legion. Best expac ever.
---
Are you really this stupid? xD
---
Please just stfu so I can go back to my dayyy
---
I'm not Horde though. Zevrim is kinda tricky on alliance. I am tanking him in the doorway with my healer next to the pillar, so he is constantly lining and does not get sacrificed. I used to line the cast, which is very hard and you need to be super fast due to spellbatching but it still helps. By now I got myself gear with 200 shadow res unbuffed (results in 260 with paladin aura) and don't even bother with lining anymore.
---
Alzzin imps don't deal any damage to me and very little to my healer tbh. Just annoying for the cast pushbacks.
---
I'm Alliance on a horde dominated server so I understand the frustration. But what other choice do they have to rank up with no battlegrounds available?
---
I doubt anybody is buying that. It’s not worth that price anymore.
---
Now I did go swords till I got PB, but going daggers is far more convenient since there is no competition. You have bonescraper which is perfectly fine, drops from a boss you need to farm anyway and has 0 competition. 
---
Taking a minor dps hit to avoid running ubrs 800 times or spending 500g on Krol Blade is a nobrainer imo.
---
I know this is all from personal experience etc so not accurate but I am amazed by the ability of PUGS on different servers.
---
I have an Alliance druid on Gehennas and a horde hunter on Shazzrah. 
---
Gehennas is well regarded as the server where the majority of Pserver players went and it's insane how much that shows.
---
I've pugged Ony and MC multiple times on my druid, oneshotting most bosses apart from a few hiccups.
---
However, I've struggled so much with my hunter shazzrah. So many wipes, people failing, groups disbanding. It's actually crazy how different the two servers compare.
---
Again, I'm sure people will answer differently but this is what I've noticed after spending the last few months pugging raids. Will be so interesting once BWL comes out.
---
Meanwhile as warrior. 2 months of raiding, 2 items
---
Vanilla PVP system heavily implies this. You compete against your own faction for rank, and in order to get honor you have to gank, without BGs this is the only possible choice for the player wishing to rank.
---
It was obvious it would be a part of classic long long long time ago. For example, check this out  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the\_argument\_for\_adding\_wsg\_in\_phase\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the_argument_for_adding_wsg_in_phase_2/)
---
To be fair, the PvP ranking system ist not exactly designed to be fair. 
---
Especially on unbalanced PvP-Servers. Hate to say it, but you kinda have to suck it up until BGs are released.
---
Yea nobody is but they ain’t reducing the price
---
That's a shame.
---
Then we have one thing in common, you never got a point from the beginning. k, bye , thx. ignore
---
No, 20% each run
---
Druid healers don't struggle too much on the healing front.
---
If you're alliance, you give them prio on Aurastone Hammer - Priests got very easy access to benediction, Paladins have a better item available. Even though that item is not reasonable to get anytime soon due to mage/lock prio, you always hand out the item to who it is BiS for anyway.
---
If you're horde, druid might need to wait on shammy healers to get aurastone hammer, and that will take a bit longer. Priests still is last in line due to 50% drop on benediction. 
---
After dire maul, staff of dominance isn't better than what a resto picks up in dungeons anyway.
---
Having the same issue when reporting for spam. Since I don't expect a fix, I learned to read my chat messages before reporting and loosing them :D
---
They are playing the game and ranking, simple as.
---
Random explosions are a soft enrage mechanic if Garr is alive for too long. Afaik it was the same on all servers?

I was a lvl 54 warlock when the honor system hit and questing is indeed impossible, but what u should do instead is find a pre-raid bis gear list for your warrior and start grinding the high level dungeons, I did that and now i have a warlock lv 60 with full pre-raid bis gear, even got skul's wand, which was very lucky.
---
its true though lmao idk why you are being downvoted 
---
he and his buddys would funnel all the gear to themselves, skarm was/is? a massive loot whore. He left his previous guild after getting decked out on his prot warrior, complained that their loot distribution was "unfair", made a new guild with his pals and ran bwl pugs with his prot warrior so that he could reserve big items. Then he ran bwl with his actual guild as a feral tank just so that could get more items

Spy only tells you that there rogue went to stealth somewhere within 50y around you. Thats a HUGE area, nothing specific..    
---
They find you most likely with some combination of Catseye elixir, Catseye goggles(engineering) and Paranoia (warlocks felhunter). If someone has all 3 mentioned, he can see stealthed rogues up to +- 20y, maybe even more(especially since most rogue are combat and don't have improved stealth). People are informed these days, they don't wait for rogues to gang them so easily like you used to be.     
---
I'm a warlock, moving around mostly with felhunter, and I can easily see rogues passing around me in 8-10y radius just with the felhunter Paranoia buff.
---
Even in Dun Morogh between low level questers I've seen it
---
Thing is, Alliance are all well coordinated machines in full raid gear, while horde is maybe 1 or 2 guilds that have some nice dedicated players rest are casuals so yes horde gets stomped. I've camped roads where horde just keeps ressing in front of me instead of taking the max distance. boggles my mind but horde is this dumb on the Tribe.
---
The only horde with some brain are on alliance side sadly.

Been killing garr for all but the very 1st reset.  Have yet to see a brutality blade drop.  Finally got our first viskag last night in our split group (only been splitting for maybe the last 4 weeks or so though).  Only Rag weapon to drop was 1 perditions if you don't count the Eye drop.  Our luck with weapons has not been great.
---
I have too. Because I have bugger all time to play, and I just want to get ony attuned and run dungeons for gear. It takes almost an hour to get anywhere. I cant stay up that late, and I'd rather do anything else than be killed the second I land, and 12 times before I reach a dungeo with a 2 minute res timer.
---
They don't hit you, even though most of them are ranged? Interesting.
---
I'm not sure what you mean, maybe you meant gnome? I'm a troll hunter in-game.
---
Probability is a thing. 
---
You have a 50/50 chance to get heads/tails, but seeing a heads 100 times in a row is very very unlikely even though the chance is always 50/50.
---
Wait, because I was asking for an evidence then I am a cunt ?
---
This is some kindergarten level logic right here bro ...
---
Is HonorSpy broken at the moment? 
---
I was getting an error message and seeing some weird names and rankings at the top yesterday and today it has altogether stopped functioning.
---
Yes. Maybe. Not necessarily. And no. In that order. Anyone who's ever been on a pvp server a single time could have told you that you'd be an idiot to expect to just be left alone on pvp servers.
---
It's not about what's right, it's about what's going to happen based on years and years of evidence. You want to be left alone, roll PvE. Otherwise lace up them ghost boots and get to corpse-hiking.
---
Good luck, i finally got perds last reset, cost me all of my dkp 😭
---
It would’ve been the most horrible main city ever.
---
No, SFK wrop are pretty much crap from my experience... There's Robes of arugal or tje staff maybe but not worth
---
The ranged ones hit you, but they dont follow and stand like turrets and are easily outhealed/tanked. When you got to a corner of a room they reset and leave combat fast so you can drink and heal fully before jumping down, killing the torchbearer and jumping back up.
---
Don't quote me on this but I think I read somewhere that The Stockades were and afterthought once RFC was designed. The Devs thought the Alliance should have something similar in a major city but the Deadmines were already tuned and made to the level they were, so they rushed the Stockades to be the next dungeon. And that's why the layout was super basic, the bosses didn't really drop loot, and it was overall underwhelming.
---
Again, don't take that as fact, if I find a source I'll come back and post it, it's just something I remember hearing.
---
That makes a lot of sense! I am probably 100% wrong in my estimation then! For some reason I just assumed it worked on some type of scroll over type of feature. Like how you can pan over a character with your mouse and it will tell you you’re their race class etc kinda like you can put your mouse over node/herb and it Tells you the type of node/herb. My bad, good thing I said probably and I would assume in my response haha.
---
Dude just let them farm honor. They are obv. trying to reach a higher rank and goota start grinding asap to have a headstart.
---
Do you think it is actually fun to them? They have to grind honor. You happen to be part of that. They would probably much rather do BG's too but currently that is the best way to grind.
---
It sucks - but it is their only Option... 2 more weeks
---
I sort of had a similar situation. I was in EPL near the weaver cave of death when I saw an orc shaman leaving the cave barely alive, I stepped in (mage) nova'd the weavers and assisted him; he survived, waved, and thanked me. while we were finishing off the last weaver a rouge ambushed and killed me. Moral is even if you try to do something good, there's always some douche hanging around waiting for an opportunity.

"PvP on a PvP server" is actually what the Horde streamers on Skeram will call this:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=368XJnlYdwI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=368XJnlYdwI) 
---
These people are really something out of the memes...
---
I guess the issue is there is no going back once you transfer. I'm on a balanced server but it is quite popular. I am thinking about transferring to a lower pop server but there is a lot of uncertainty whether it would be better.
---
This is a huge point to consider. Trying to start an actual conversation with someone instead of letting them know that you're just using them makes all the difference.
---
How is Dragonfang Alliance?
---
Just wait a minute
---
My favorite is finding people running gank squads on Twitch and the amount of try hard from them to gank a single level 50 with four to five geared 60s is just silly, people like ZetoxXD are such try hard no lifers, it almost makes me happy knowing they will burn out long before R14.

I've never heard that! Do you have any more information about that being the case, I'd love to read about it. Doesn't make a lot of sense they would put two major cities on top of each other like that.
---
You need to find a way to enjoy the game and overall progress of your guild rather than your character alone. Loot drama around weapons like mageblade is nothing compared to BWL drops. Mageblade is super abundant and shows up every third week from the easiest boss in the easiest raid. By the time phase 3 comes, all your core mages, locks and even paladins should have it. If wowhead drop % is anything to go by, the next upgrade on it which drops from Nefarian is about 8%, so you should see that maybe onc every 3 months, assuming you can reliably down Nefarian every week.

or just go pve server, whatever ;D

That's only if you're dumb enough to go via UC instead of Grom gol
---
Awkward. Guessing you never saw the BG stats Blizzard released... Doesn't get much better for alliance I'm afraid.
---
Go to a PvE server. PVP isn't for you
---
Thats logical. Man, they maps are designed for 3k players but it's overpopulated now. Explains alot!
---
Im also on a PvP Server and have like 2h / das playtime. Questing in contested zones is a no-Go, but Dungeon-running for bis items is perfectly doable.
---
I play on ZT and it’s one of the most balanced pvp serves out there.

I like to think that way too, but the odds are so against me in this case :D

https://wow.gamepedia.com/MACRO_castsequence
---
I don't think it's douchy. In fact I think that's the intended gameplay on pvp-server, random opportunities and player choice to pursue them or not. Fair 1v1 is an exception at best.
---
I think most locks switched to DM:E unless they really don't want to get mining. I gave up on mara farms when I realized that good 5 runs with ton of weapon drops will still only get you about 35g in an hour without any gathering profession, and if you are going to get one, you might as well do DM:E for the rich thorium veins.
---
What I did was offer gold to players that help me just farm the first boss, you can decide on the payment rules. For me, its if it dropped then everyone in the group got 20g, people will love to join cause you can clear to the spider boss in under 15mins. This way you dont waste time with the whole dungeon.
---
It's the beards
---
Interesting to see the lack of any of the raid content we ended up with. By that map and their original plan we'd have gotten:
---
\- Karazhan 65-70 Raid  
---
\- Ahn'qiraj ? - ? Raid (but with how it's listed, wouldn't be surprising to see it as 65-70)  
---
\- Dragon Isle 65-70 raid  
---
\- Black Temple 70+ raid
---
This definitely fits the impression I've had of Molten Core being extremely rushed. If you compare it to content that was added after it, it's just basically a big cave with enemies crammed in and bosses dotted around randomly. A bunch of them don't even have proper boss rooms and are just big versions of trash mobs. Heck, even Ragnaros says it was TOO SOON for him to be in the game, I wonder if that was at least in part a little side jab from the designers as well as the obvious reasons they claim in-game.
---
Would you add Captain to that list as well? He seems to know a fair bit and has done well in some previous duel tourneys before release.
---
Anyone knows the average pop on a realm? I actually have no idea...

Already have a 60 warrior so would be unwilling to do it again tbh :p

Right? I see RP interactions on a daily basis. ZT best server!
---
if he left because of losing 30 minutes it's not a big loss. Trust me i've lost more time leveling my alt even being in the 60% side.
---
/castsequence Spell1,Spell2,Spell3 should cycle the spells, one per button press
---
He might be talking about attunments.
---
Redundant argument. Realm transfers from PvP to pve were available in vanilla. Im a no changes kinda guy. The change of increased population on servers is the problem.
---
I was thinking exactly that and almost tried it yesterday, but even better: 5g per run for each person, even if it dropped or not.
---
I think I can do it without a tank, 4 dps and a heal. Maybe a fury warrior to take those hits. It's also faster this way. I call these "mercenaries" xD
---
All you gotta do is have 1 account on the opposing faction, level it up, then go round killing his spies.
---
Your mounted speed will be faster than he can corpse run 10 spies.
---
It is actually smart to level more than one character at the same time because of rest experience, you level them way faster, and you also have 6 professions to level instead of 2.

i know its not just horde side, cuzz theres ally doing it also on ally favored servers, but as a horde player i do somewhat feel kinda ashamed of this behaviour.

If some of the worst stories here, and the one from the guy are even mostly true I would reroll as well. Getting to 60 isnt that hard for me and tyere is still a decent chance to catch up.
---
Yes, you can use castsequence macro.
---
    /castsequence Frost Shock, Earth Shock, Flame Shock
---
You can't simply press the macro once and it will cast all spells after another, but everytime you press the macro it will cast Frost Shock first, then the 2nd time you press the macro it will cast Earth Shock, and finally Flame shock.
---
You can adjust it by putting a conditional in front of it that it resets when you switch targets for example (useful for rogues when they need to build up combat points again)
---
    /castsequence reset=target Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning
---
So what this does is cast Lightning bolt on a target, and chain lightning afterwards on the same target if you press the macro again. It will reset to Lightning bolt if you switch targets before casting Chain Lightning.
---
Warlocks are pretty awesome. Leveling as Affliction enables you to farm mobs non-stop while maintaining your HP and mana through LT and DL.
---
I'd highly advise leveling on a realm whose population is skewed towards the faction you choose. Usually Alliance on PvE servers or Horde on PvP servers. Makes everything better. Do a little research before choosing the realm.
---
[https://ironforge.pro/servers](https://ironforge.pro/servers)
---
I mean, it's the best place in the game to farm wool cloth. And there is a couple quests you can do in a major city. But if you look at the loot tables for the 'bosses', you'll realize it was basically an afterthought.
---
At least RFC had bosses that actually dropped greens at the least.
---
Revenge and Shield Slam (if deep prot) both produce noticeably more threat than sunder.
---
I don't understand the concept of 'done'
---
I quit the game too. 1 hour corpse run to brd is too much. 30 min was OK. And disconnecting from battle net client is a joke. Not being disconnected from game but from whole client. I will wait until middle January to see how things are going. This game is unplayable.
---
I think this was true in Vanilla but not in Classic.
---
Any lock that knows the mechanics of classic will never apply more than 1 dmg dot. Immolate is insane threat and fire damage, Agony is replaced by Curse of Elements/Shadows/Recklessness leaving only Corruption left. Sometimes even in a 25 man raid, there will not even be debuff slots left for anything else anyway.
---
I have zero interest in RP, but anybody who joins an RP server and doesn't engage in it should be banned from that server, in my opinion.
---
My guild has been raiding since week 3 we have 2 raid teams I’m a warlock I have 1 item from MC the other locks are similar though all 5 have the ony head , team 2 though have been raiding only 5 weeks n there locks have loads from mc , but no onyx heads ,,, it’s weird
---
happened to me the other day but it was DM and i was in UC
---
Have you played on stalaag? Every day it's like this.
---
Play on a PvP Server they said. It'll be fun they said. 
---
Honestly what did people expect? 
---
Funny part is these servers were so full they had queues just to get in. I'm glad I rolled PvE.
---
That's BS, I've seen plenty of organized effort from Horde. Ton of them around Everlook and plaguelands. Alliance is obviously more dominant around BRM since it's right next to our capitals, but I still see it contested by Horde all the time.
---
.....I'm pretty sure the level 57 NPC's are a bigger threat than the opposite faction to a level 2 :)
---
Well, assuming that hes not selling gold for real money. If he is, he needs less than 10 lotus a month to just get his money back.
---
Yeah, women don't like things, can't have been a woman.
---
Back in the days i were in the exact same thoughts as you are, gearing my own character were the most important thing for me. Now when classic is out and i've grown up a lot since those days my goal has shifted and its not about gearing my own character anymore, ofc its nice to get an item but since im so fond of the people i play with im just as happy when they get an upgrade as i am if i get one. Getting your entire raid geared together and seeing diffrent people preform better every raid is so nice feeling. Progressing through the content and enjoying this game together with your guild is much more satisfying now then it was when i was younger.
---
Nor am I saying you should, merely pointing out that there's 0 reason for the priest to die during sacrifice since using the solo kite method she is basically invulnerable to that boss while the sacrifice times out.

Isn't that also the first and biggest EU PvP server? I can't say it comes as a surprise if you're playing on the server most EU streamers use and was designated as the first big EU PvP server....you kind of had to know it was coming then?
---
We have queues on my server in the evening, but the only time BRM is completely camped is when raids are entering, otherwise it's just groups of either 5-10 hordes or 5-10 alliance that decide to camp it while they wait for their remaining players to come for UBRS.

im a simple man,
---
i see asmond, i downvote
---
I think he was saying the PvP servers are turning into PvE servers with the lack of alliance around to PvP against.  The alliance are leaving so the servers are dying.
---
Afraid not. The character you want the BoP loot for needs to be in range at the time of the kill.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing
---
well, how smart was it when you didn't get even one to 60 before p2?
---
I did once 15 ago, i made sure to skip it this time haha..
---
It does work with the 5 set bonus, so you've got 3 different 25% chances of getting your mana back. Our shaman almost never goes OOM at this point with 8/8 Earthfury, just spamming Healing Wave.
---
What I can't seem to find out, but it seems like it, is that Healing Wave doesn't act like Chain Heal, so there is a lot of overhealing, but I may be wrong on this.
---
It was Archimonde, a warrior named Noktyn.
---
That one really isn't too off, Onyxia melees like a whimp and due to the fight mechanics if the tank not with aggro in p1 positions themselves correctly on the threat table this is where you end up.
---
It's the flame breaths that kill you on ony hitting for 3,5k roughly, her melees are around 5-600 on cloth i'd imagine, she hits me as a tank for 2-300.

---
Game is feeling pretty dead to me
---
Oh, yeah, just like women too lightly dressed ask to be harassed, right?
---
Because low levels could grief the enemies extremely easily.  SS vs TM would be over in a day if you got DKs from accidentally killing lowbies.  A bunch of level 5 horde run into a mages blizzard and die and the mage gets no honor for the week?  Now THAT would be a real problem.
---
No, that's an urban myth. Molten core was made in a month, not a week. A week for the level design, a week for the bosses, a week for the loot and tuning and a week for the quests and reputation faction. This is straight from an interview with the devs.
---
Probably cuz it's posted 3 times
---
Good points there. They're both basically throwaway dungeons, and basically convenient quest hubs. Deadmines and SFK are the where the real upgrades happen. So you're right, they basically are mirror dungeons just at different levels.
---
This is my first time playing classic/vanilla as Horde and it's crazy how much more accessible dungeons are on this side. Deadmines seemed like a distant idea until someone told me you can jump off the Org to STV zeppelin early and swim really quick to Westfall. And once I found out there was a teleporter to Gnomeregan for Horde I realized that alliance had nothing of the sort for the Razorfen and Scarlet Monestary dungeons. SM especially being an amazing series of dungeons to farm.
---
Do you also call ppl a bitch to their face, or is it just when protected by a screen? 
---
*spoiler, "yes/no" are both pretty bad answers.
---
And this is posted 4 times
---
Yes, you can loot the chest with your alt.
---
'If it's clear that you never do'... yeah? How are you gonna police this? How will Blizzard agree what is a reasonable amount of RP to do, what classifies as RP, and measure it? Think about the practicality of what you're saying, it's a pretty daft idea.
---
They literally walk through walls...
---
Yes. If all melee stays in it will always be the same three people with the lowest guid. Best you just have everyone stay in, raid marker the 3 unlucky melee, and assign them a healer to keep an eye on them to ensure they always make it back.
---
Could be just the closest 2 targets rather than the 2 nearby targets with the lowest %health value.
---
But if you get 3 times the chance to get mana back the overhealing isnt too bad considering unlimited mana.
---
This is the most stupid thing I have read in ages.
---
Lol alliance were doing the same thing on Tuesday. They were camping the zep from grom to org. That and my hearth was in grom so I went to dm to get buffs for raid and almost died  trying to get to org. So I left and took the fp to booty and used the boat to ratchet. 
---
There is always another way in this game to get somewhere. Both horde and alliance are camping for hks.  If you did not plan for this why did you roll on a pvp server. This is part of the game. Blizzard makes Pve servers for people who don’t enjoy pvp. 
---
You really have no right to complain. people just playing the game the way it was intended to be played.
---
where did i say this? rolling on a hardcore server but playing casual is a recipe for disappointment tho.
---
It's not a budget hearth if it activates the hearthstone cooldown.
---
What are the gear requirements like?
---
You should try playing on a Normal server, there is still PVP if you want it but you won't get ganked just trying to quest/get into dungeons if you don't  want to be.
---
The ones with optimal specs are already benefiting the raid more than the lazy 2-handers in this scenario, though they may want to wreck faces in PvP on off-days. Your suggestion would most likely lead to a worse raid performance overall since they'd gimp themselves by speccing 2handers just for a chance at these items.
---
Im Horde an do wPVP with a 5 to 7 man group.  
---
We are farming Honor for rankings ofcourse, but we only kill 51 to 60's.
---
If we kill you, we mount and ride further, if we happen to spot you later, we kill you again, but we never corspecamp you.   
---
Also if we see, we killed more people , multiple times in that zone, we moveout to a new zone.
---
But i happen to see alot of doucebags, on both alliance and horde side, who are zerging ( in 10 / 20 / 40man groups) and camping and killing everythings thats breaths.  
---
 Yeah those are the assholes... and deserve minus points......
---
There are actually tons of references to the dark iron dwarves fucking up and summoning ragnaros that start from the moment you enter searing gorge. But most are subtle enough that players don't pick up on it until it's thrown in their face at the end of BRD.
---
Diplo and friends is the best guild name I’ve seen so far across all the realms. This new pally really fucked up by not naming himself dfran or rlgrime etc etc. missed opportunities
---
Our guild has already seen 3 eye of sufron it’s pretty stupid cause if another one drops idk if anyone wants thats responsibility
---
What's wrong with your brightness settings? That place normally is preety dark and dank.
---
I dont get why they all camp the flghtmaster.
---
They are 30sec honorless and there are Civils nearby.
---
The Ship - has no guards, no civils and no honorless target. The loading screen also ressurects everybody for double honor.
---
I’m on a PvE-RP server and still enjoying every minute of it.
---
Yes I did. I don't think he was that bad pre-classic. Strange as hell for sure, but pretty decent.
---
And people want you to be lvl 18 for dm, lol... Just proves that this game is filled with elitist losers.
---
Lmfao you have some true mental issues kid
---
He is simply talking about a guildie leaving. He never once complained about the Situation himself I think.
---
All he is bothered about is that People are leaving. No reason to be so salty xD
---
Why do you get so mad when People talk about this? Can you not just skip this post? 
---
You are probably just like them you just took stance againt it because you are a fighter!! But you don't want to Play yourself because you are just as pissed off as them xD
---
But you are badass!!!
---
what you're effectively advocating for is for the 1-handers to lower their DPS by switching to 2-handers in a scenario like this. They've already put in more effort than you by making sure they have the optimal set-up, why fuck them over for it because you can't be bothered going DW?
---
*such is no life*
---
Sorry for the noob question, how would this get you saved to a cleared raid id?

/grats instead of /congratulations...

It's not about horde or alliance it's about population balance

I swear just last week asmongold went on a rant about how people shouldn't be responsible for things like this.

Did it 10 more times for the cape from baron and never seen it again. Wanted the boots from anub aswell, but got giantstalker yesterday so im done with that shithole now.
---
It gets better with more content. Once you are doing not only MC but BWL and AQ20, 40 and ZG, your chances of gear per week really blow up.
---
Wow. lol
---
I feel you, mate.
---
We've been clearing MC for 8 weeks now. 
---
First week, Leaf drops. First in line gets it, awesome, I'm next.
---
Week two to eight: Eye drops. 
---
There's no other item I really care about. I don't mind that we got four T1 drops in eight weeks. I don't mind that I only get single digit rolls on Onyxia's head. All I want is that damn leaf. And knowing it has a 50% chance and yet it still might never drop is INFURIATING.
---
Yea i tried to do MC attunement quest and it took like 4 hours and coulnd'nt finish. People quitted i had to find another, new ones insisted on lava run and we wiped there 2 time in lava. Games suppose to be fun. It feels like running simulation. Going anywhere takes too much time and finishing dungeons takes more.
---
Sweet man ty!
---
And? build time was still a month, not a week.
---
Had a fury warrior tank it once (like, an actual leather wearing dps warrior), was fun time healing that.
---
&gt;You are not supposed to have only one character in classic
---
Exactly, you're not supposed to have a 10 hour a week hobby, classic HAS to be a full time job. Part time is allowed, but frowned upon.
---
(That's a website, not addon)
---
no one cares.
---
M e l O v e Y o u
---
What about like tarnished Elven ring etc.. they get sold to people outside of the instance?
---
Still, odd that it wasnt more forshadowing of it. Compared to onyxia Qline, ubrs introducing nerfarian and brd leading into molten core. The buildup of AQ was rly obscure imo :D
---
That's nice sweetie.  Run along and gank now.
---
Grats mon!
---
On the contrary, I've seen 4 capes in my runs and at least 4-5 wildheart pants. One of the capes went to greed.
---
Rng is rng I guess.
---
Have fun!
---
How about iceblock not removing them? keep your off topic questions to yourself ;)...
---
People keep parroting the "we run the server" shit same as they did when he said they will roll on all servers and control all of them (people were literally losing their shit raging over that).  
---
It's hyperbolic, it's to incite people just like you to talk about it and give him free advertisement, he rose to one of the top spots on twitch because people swallow everything he says and repeat it everywhere without thinking that maybe it's intentional and he won't and can't take over a server or a multitude of servers, but gain more attention.
---
That's my problem with it too. You generally have to zoom in really close and basically track along the ground.
---
Then what do you do for the other 15 horde dominated pvp servers?
---
I'm Alliance on ZT and even though I try to pay attention to where Alliance are "holding", I've never actually seen it. Every time I land at LHC for a Stratholme run, it's always camped by Horde. Every time I fly to Burning Steppes for something in BRM, I need to corpse hop a few times. Every time I've flown to Everlook or Gadgetzan, I'm slain by a large group of Horde as soon as the gryphon lands.
---
Despite knowing the realm has a *slight* Alliance bias, I've never seen Alliance hold anywhere. Reason? Horde has better PvP racials, so those who are PvP inclined lean more towards that faction.
---
I know Alliance *does* have PvP presence on the server, but I never see it. Do our groups only focus on Horde-only FPs/hubs and ignore neutrals or something?
---
There's like, 1 major alliance dominated server. How does your math work?
---
No I am the rogue ganking all of the cry babies on boats.
---
He expects not to be outnumbered in server population by 1/2. Most pvp servers there are 2 hordes for every alliance. But well, the fun stops next week when you have to sit in queue all day while the alliance get to play all day.
---
lol, ur an idiot if u think horde are try hard, try hards go alliance cause paladins are fucking broken.
---
Worse thing about dying as warlock, you have to do tons of shit after you respawn.
---
Yeah, of course the shout depends on the circumstances. You're right about the BR tho.
---
2 
---
well then that's just like classic,
---
8
---
in my classic experience we just spam /e to make up for it and I ment in the context of rp
---
1
---
It might be a lot for obvious reasons but is more better? (and thinking about it can you even use most of it in one set even if it matches due to the sheer resolution difference?)
---
Not really, for classes who heavily rely on dots and prolonged fights, this is a nerf.   
---
Or its more like another perk/buff for playing Burst Classes , which can kill you fast, but die fast, too.
---
That's like telling a taxi driver that if he doesn't want to have a car accident he shouldn't drive.
---
As i mentioned above T0 is superior yes. 
---
But you end up replacing it if you get 2 "good" items from MC. (shoulders + chest for example)
---
If you dont believe me with that just go and check out the Bloodmoon dps spreadsheet or read a little bit in the rogue discord.
---
But why did you spit on him? Do you usually go around spitting on people? 
---
At the very least I would leave a negative note reminding me to not group with you again.
---
It said the week of the 10th so it could be a few days after
---
My brother is an RP weirdo and forced me to create my character on one, luckily not much RP though.
---
They absolutely do have a clear advantage. They're all very accessible as Horde.
---
The worst part as a horde is getting the SoS/Badlands flight paths having to do a major run from Undercity or STV.
---
With that in mind, I would say that Uldaman is an Alliance dungeon except I'm playing a horde warrior this time around and the dwarf bosses gave me a slow fall shield and a goblin rocket helm that alliance don't have access to. Both of which I still use while running into Blackrock mountain at level 60. So the inconvenience has really paid off well.
---
But if you look at almost every dungeon, horde have quick access. Even the quick quest and boat from ratchet to BB with the teleporter pad makes Gnomeregan as easy to do for horde as running from IF, which most Alliance aren't hanging out near at that level.
---
I stress to think of any dungeon outside of Deadmines, Stockades, and maybe Sunken Temple that are clearly harder for Horde to get to than Alliance.
---
It's actually the most sensible thing to do. I'm not into RP by any means, but joining such server should come with some obligations. If you are that fucking dense to not get it...
---
Because he doesnt want to have to entertain a massive audience with Classic gameplay. If hes farming Thorium for 6 hours most people would not enjoy that. 
---
Of course he could just not stream, but his core fanbase wants him to, so he streams for them on a non-advertised channel that only they really know about.
---
I think there should be some algorithm that reduces honor if there are much more players from one faction in a given area. For instance, if you gank a player 5v1 you get 0 honor if there are no players from his faction in let's say 60yd range. If there are 2-3 other players even if they don't help the victim, you can gain honor, but less if it was a 5v5 fight. This way gaining honor will be actually "honorable" and the game won't incentivise ganking . You can still gank players 5v1, but it just wouldn't matter at all for your gearing process. Also lvl 48s giving honor to lvl 60s is just stupid. It should be lvl 55 at least. If they fix the unfair ganking and the killing of lowbies, world PVP can be a joy.
---
Oh, its fun, start of 2010s, right in time when the streaming start becoming a thing... 
---
I think its a matter of pov, so if i listen to you, before 2010 you didnt know the word stream ? 
---
You're an asshole and a cheater for looking at your opponent split screen, but he was not streaming, because he's supposed to be the only one to see his screen.
---
But when someone is looking on a stream (twitch/yt/etc) to kill the streamer, yep he's stream sniping.
---
sO i gUesS tHe rEaL quEsTiOn... Two thing are sure in life, taxes and that the age doesn't bring wisdom.
---
Alliance just ganks the boat between  ratchet and booty bay
---
It's a bit of both, but the buff change is really more major. As long as a player doesn't do anything, and he doesn't receive/lose any buffs, he could be standing right next to you and Spy wouldn't say a thing.
---
For 20 runs? I dont think so. Also why not go for the ancient bone bow from scholo?
---
(:
---
At the start, i hated it, now, I love it.
---
That man's voice is out of this world
---
So feign deith make them leave combat instantly? I was wondering how they get em off
---
Quel sera is better then flurry just for the pure dmg and it is a sword if you are human
---
Endgame Classic is boring, 
---
when you hit 60 then a week passes you got all pre raid bis. 
---
Then you basically raid log(You only log on to raid), or maybe farming abit gold and do a little pvp.
---
I did runs 6 to get it, im now 20 runs in and still have to see a baron cape drop. Not getting your hopes up is the key to happiness.... I also always say, that I need the peacemaker weapon and then sell it for $$$$ :D
---
No you cannot. sorry
---
Nice
---
Which makes it statistically useless
---
You don't go to parties, don't lie to yourself.
---
Also this has been an awesome discussion my man, what server are you playing on? And I think you might have mentioned it but I already forgot, horde or alliance?
---
Hashtag no changes bitch.
---
No, the main problem is the faction imbalance.  Even with higher than original numbers, if there were a balance of A:H or close to it, there would be a hell of a lot less problems.
---
https://de.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
Looks about even, on a first glance except for the extremes. Tho pve servers are in here, do you have a source that shows pvp servers only?
---
Cross faction you can also mix languages. No problem with a russian alliance fighting a english horde and vice-versa, we don't understand each other anyways.  This Would require changes for the server choice tho, since you would need to sort a server's horde character creation to one language, while shifting the lliance to another.
---
I have a question 
---
Can you tell me how these rank please?
---
I currently run demonfork MH And slicing hatchet OH. What is The DPS of these in comparison to 
---
Deep woods MH Hatchet OH
---
Deep woods MH Frostbite OH
---
Frostbite MH Hatchet OH
---
Played hunter in vanilla and started raiding soon after 60. Guild had MC on farm, going through BWL. TBC was 6 or 7 months away. Hunter's T1 chest dropped only once during that time frame... And it was in the only raid I skipped...
---
Haha, when you're in a middle of a battle and suddendly get double crit from chain lighting.. what a feeling
---
While leveling I was using greater heal and heal in max rank (or heal and lesser heal, depending on your level). That is enough to heal all dungeons up to about ST/BRD where things get difficult as shadow healer. I stopped healing at about level 50 and went to dungeons as DPS and re-specced at 60.
---
I leveled paladin to 60 with the aim to tank dungeons and it works wonderfully but the constant mana-issues make it unbearably slow tank. I'm thinking of rolling either a warrior or druid next for the same case: tanking only dungeons. While a warrior is obviously strong, the other benefits of a druid also appeal to me (stealth mainly as I play on pvp server alliance side).
---
Is there any clear downsides to tanking a dungeon with a druid compared to warrior, just like how paladin needs to sit and drink almost after every pull? Just dungeons, I don't intend to tank raids even if I end up rolling a warrior.
---
Its just not, haha, what sites u using for that BiS list?
---
Arugal?
---
Please tell me you brought the grenades this time?
---
rule 3
---
They are farming. And the produce they farm is you.
---
Don't like being a product? Go pvp off.
---
Why?
---
Twitch bans for literally no reason at this point so I sincerely doubt they checked any logs despite they being able to.
---
It was actually made before the game launched, but they weren't sure if instanced raids were possible with the game engine. So it was kind of late in the process but they had wanted to do it all along (Everquest had non instanced raids).
---
A lot of the bosses and mobs were duplicated for sure because the "suits" didnt want to allocate more resources for an idea that might not pan out. John Staats, who was the big creative mind behind a lot of the dungeon modeling said they ended up developing MC in secret. The story, raid layout, loot and everything was kind of on the hush because they would have got in trouble with the people who had to make sure the game launched on time.
---
He said he developed the entire inside of MC after his regular work hours, doing late nights and it was kind of a secret project that the big hitters on the dev team wanted to see launched with the game. So you're right it was absolutely rushed and they made it work, but the idea of raids in WoW was basically built off the backs of the people who really cared about making the game as awesome as they could.
---
I've plugged it once already in the comments but I'll say it again, the Countdown to Classic podcast has a handful of absolutely amazing interviews with John and they're very worth listening to.
---
John even recently made a book about the development process of WoW that has a ton of this information that I'm looking forward to reading once I have some expendable income.
---
it's not that there is something worth 10k that I want to buy, it's that 10k gold means i don't have to farm gold to raid/pvp for a year.  I would rather use Dal'rends and sell it for 10k gold while waiting for vis'kag or even waiting until BWL for a CTS.  10k gold would make a way bigger difference in my gameplay than equipping Teebu's.
---
So he's offscreen?
---
Others suggested warlock but a mage is good too. It doesn't depend on gear, has access to it's own drinks, kills stuff very fast (usually one frostbolt -&gt; 2x fireball) and has excellent control to boot. Additionally it's a beast in pvp without needing to be decked in raidgear. On top of that mage has it easiest when it comes to farming gold solo.
---
I've played both to 30 now and mage has been much more fun due to its simplicity and utility. Mages are also in higher demand for dungeons because of water and poly. Warlock is fun but managing soul shards became a chore real fast. I found that I'm always out of inventory space because I need to keep so many soul shards around (summoning a demon costs one, healthstone costs one, some spells cost one etc etc).
---
Swtor was a perfect example of why you don't rush games. It launched with broken PvP, half a raid, and 1, or was it 2 endgame instances. Multiple classes also needed large balance passes, due to being either crazy good (operative) or crazy bad (sentinel).
---
not really, the difference between Vis'kag and Teebu's is bigger than the difference between Teebu's and Dal'Rends
---
We had Locks and Rogues tank Onyxia too.
---
As long they act quickly and turn her face on tankposition before the next breath, its fine. 
---
They mostly die on the breath, too huge single hit of dmg. I recommend priest shielded before and precast heal the breath.
---
Really nice comment right there. 
---
We don't level up wep skills hitting hord scum right?
---
Who hasn't called someone a bitch to another person's face in real life? Stop being a little bitch, bitch.
---
Don't be so naive
---
You know money change people
---
Interesting, I'm not sure. I'm going to assume not.
---
Easiest way to check would be to check it with a % Crit item equipped and un equipped.
---
At work so can't check right now. If I remember I'll try when I get back.
---
Lv.39 is the first bracket with full access to max professions.
---
Many will target this bracket to make a crafting alt.
---
Hahahahaha
---
that cleave thing is some weird ass shit come on. lol
---
Same here, I have a 58 Warlock and a 48 Shaman and the game is unplayable on my server.
---
Ofcourse it does, if your stats are way more optimal for your class, your character is stronger.
---
There are way less dead-stats on item in 1.12.1 than there are in 1.7, there are some pieces left but for instance there are barely any cloth pieces with agility.
---
Also I don't think you had spell power in 1.7, you had like + healing, or + frostdamage etc, while in 1.12 you the general +damage and healing.
---
I'm on bloodsail, there isn't much rp, but it is still there.
---
I just wanted to say thanks for the comments in this post. I’m a tank in classic because my guild needed one, but now that we are end game I struggle getting rage / threat with group pulls. 
---
Generally my dps just start immediately, or they all pick different targets, which makes things significantly harder. I’ve been tab sundering to try for aggrieved on everything, but I’ve been rage starved. I’ll keep the berserker fury in mind and ignore thunderclap go forward.
---
Nice comment + flair combo.
---
WotF also not broken am I right? Just as useful as perception.
---
Randomness makes it exciting. Guarantees make it boring.
---
Because that's bad or something
---
Hope to level my warrior after I get my priest to 60 . I would love to play my warrior in battlegrounds, so what spec would be better? Arms or Fury? Or are they both as good?
---
After doing my first guild MC run, the first thought in my head was, "so this is why retail has personal loot and no more raidwide loot."
---
It's a mess, and if you force yourself to live and die by the loot that drops, you aren't going to enjoy it very long. Try to be the man that steps up and passes to your friend on the next many things that drop. You'll learn it feels good to see the people you love happy and appreciative when you do. And if they're a good friend, they'll pass to you next time. You shouldn't avoid doing content with your friends because you're worried about loot rolls. Just play the game and have fun while you guys are still both healthy, alive, and able to.
---
Oh yes so incredibly riveting.
---
Its truly riveting to lose simply to numbers. Its truly riveting to be stunlocked to death upon landing at any flight path. Its truly riveting to take an hour of your play time not playing the game because you are stuck on a gray screen.
---
Yeah had this too.  Stopped using frost traps on most pulls becaus of it. Wasnt worth waiting for mobs to 100% reset every pull vs having to res pet occasionally.
---
How can asmon be so bad at the game when he ayed it so much?
---
 I had no problems on Bloodsail Buccaneers
---
Because the capital is ironforge, and the flight from IF to BB is quite long.
---
Always Need, always. If it turns out the entire rest of the group Greeded then apologise and have them /roll, trade it to the winner.
---
Needing a BoE is literally a no-lose option. It stops ninjas and is not permanent.
---
You will probably make more flowers farming dm:e for an hour and buying them than if you were to farm them yourself anyway.
---
The flight master should be a DHK
---
You can hearth while it's on cooldown though. I prefer ghetto hearthstone though. Sounds funnier.
---
What are these?
---
Yea, and I forgot about the slowfall shield from Uldaman, I may have to go and pick that one up myself. Playing on Bloodfang, and sticking to the faction with the class that drew me into this game from my first time playing Warcraft 3 - the Shaman, and Horde :) given the number of servers the odds aren't that great, but might you happen to be on the same realm?
---
For the 5000th time. Vanilla wpvp was never like this. Ever. I don't know who keeps telling people it was like this but it's a lie. Vanilla servers didn't have this many people and the people weren't out looking to grief others like this. What is happening right now is griefing, plain and simple.
---
Yeah, no way that's just 70
---
might just be lucifron. It's the same here.
---
Arms
---
Didn't they make it so you have to play every day to get your artifact power or smth?
---
It was pretty chill back when raid logging was all you had to do, and the rest of the time could be spent playing alts or spamming bgs/arenas.
---
No...why do people think this. Honor has been out awhile now
---
If it was shattered (into the two bindings that drop atm), how can you loot the whole piece? Makes no sense. Not supported but contradicts the lore I'd say.
---
Would you think 
---
Warrior: Alchemy+Eng
---
Warlock : Mining+Herb
---
Is something you could go with?
---
Paladin is easy (you only cast Flash of Light), never goes oom in dungeons after pre-bis, has the best buffs. Additionally you have the bubble which can be used to negate some mechanics completely. What priest has over paladin is PW:S for those oh shit moments, aoe heals and can dispel enemies.
---
Priest wins clearly for raid wide healing, while paladin is the clear winner in dungeons.
---
"Seems like you should reroll on a PvE server, scrub!" -Neckbeardus Prime after gobbling down his 12th Hot Pocket and filling his poop sock to the brim
---
If they just knew about the dark arts of quotstionmarks!
---
A simple man here as well
---
wow, pvp realms are amazing, I see 5 guys having soooooo much fun
---
I love good hunter pvp. I thought I could be that once. But I couldn't. Love to watch it still though.
---
We haven't seen weapons either. As for deciding who needs something more try instead picking two things that you both need and splitting them saying that the other guy won't roll on that etc. I got the first quick-strike and gave onslaught girdle to the other warrior who is top-tier just so we didn't have to discuss or fight about it.
---
I'm a gnome and would have joined the second i saw em haha
---
Bout tree fiddy
---
I’m not a little bitch!
---
If you guys rag on me 13 or 14 more times I’ outta here.
---
Uh, believe me Alliance still manage to gank Hordies quite easily on the Zeppelins (speaking as a Hordie on Heartseeker)
---
This is happening everywhere in shazzrah. Id imagine it's happening to both horde and alliance on any server with an imbalance. I just want to level, then I can take part but until then it's getting unplayable.
---
You need to tank until tou get your gear. Dps warrior is more for raids.  Having the tank roll for dps gear, like leather, is fine as long as you make that clear from the start. Check your bis list though, no need to upset all the rogue/Hunter/druid/shaman for every piece of loot. 
---
You don’t really need to respec for 5mans, but it might help if you’re undergeared.
---
Kargath is bad if you want to join Diremaul groups. I prefer Grom'Gol. The flight to kargath is pretty short and you have direct access to the zepps to go to UC for strat/scholo and Org for Diremaul
---
They are rng dependent. Ultimately garbage but fun to play. Ele is sweet but lack survivability. Both are glass canons. Resto is where it's at, especially for 1v1. Very hard to burst down, still do big damage, can heal for days. Go for the tree where you dont waste half your talent pts.
---
I was thinking about this one as well. Obvious con is that you don't get Engi on your lock, and you have to spam the two different Detect abilities in a macro when in the open world to farm (or see) both.
---
Won't you have to queue from the quartermaster?
---
Except moonguard
---
Bruh that's from September.
---
Someone, role-playing as a guy using the Spy Add-on kills you out of nowhere and corpse camps you, and when you express your concern about this hurting the game for people, another guy in chat roleplays as the guy that goes 'herpa durr PvP happen in PvP server kek', and you consider roleplaying as someone who cancels their subscription.
---
Yeah, the RP rules should be far, far stricter.
---
Rekt
---
I assume he tabbed out using the snipping tool or something instead of taking a screenshot. The default settings make the game run at a locked 30fps while it's running in the 'background'.
---
Back in vanilla it took me 42 Ony kills for my T2 helm. Rng is rng.
---
Them having to wait forever would mean they just spend more time in wpvp. Trust me, it's a good thing there are cross server bgs, but horde are still more populated overall
---
Probably the same way I have 5 mid 30s toons. Can't make up their mind. But I already knew I was gonna do it.
---
Done is just ready for new content!
---
Yeah, I mean if having Eng in both is a must then this wouldnt work for OP obviously but its the only thing I came up with, guess he covered all the other options mostly.
---
Fuck that, have you played the ruskis? EU Classic Will die if you crossrealm with the ruskis.
---
Lies.
---
There's not enough mages.
---
I got bodied yesterday in LBRS because I overextended. Tank and Heal apologized eben though I told them it's my own fault. Added the guys an I hope to run with them again. Not makind same mistake again!
---
Seriously. IF has guards walking the long long path up to IF from the bottom of the mountain, and 4-5 stealth detectors walking around. Guard everywhere. Same with SW. 
---
Org has 2 guards.
---
Nope. People sell items out of the trib chest frequently. You don't need to be in the instance when it drops
---
I am amazed that you managed to actually get a FD trap off in PvP without scatter.
---
what's an uy, what is man a warrior, why is rabbit level 3, why are they in silithus SO MANY QUESTIONS
---
5000g worth of Arcanite Bars
---
Once again, link it. Like any other scenario: Innocent until proven guilty. You must be one of those people who LOVE cancel culture.
---
Sad little people
---
you seen the run back horde have if we die in Menthil? It’s nuts. Get over the ganking
---
Ask yourself, do you really want the concessions the horde scum gets? OP racials, ez flightpaths? Because I certainly don't. This attracts weak players and everyone knows all the best players roll Alliance.
---
As a warlock, you absolutely need to get a fireball in phase 2, or you will pull aggro in phase 3. If you don't get fireballed in p2, anticipate and move to tanking spot to sacrifice yourself for the team.
---
&gt;most EU streamers use
---
Apes went to Gehennas and other than that there arent really any big or well-known guilds or streamers at all in EU. Anniefuchsia might be the only big streamer on Shazzrah, and shes already back to retail mainly.
---
There are a shitton of horde players ganking in brm not just while waiting for a group to fill, but to actively farm honor. BRM on Shazzrah isnt just random small skirmishes in front of dungeon entrances, were talking about systematic honor farming there with priests using mind control to move players as far back as possible before they're getting killed so they cant even effectively corpserun, or entire raids coordinating their positions and attacks and spamming sappers to stop entire mc raids from entering, I even saw mc pugs disbanding just because of this.
---
Status
---
Hey! Blacklisted! WTF happened? You all left Whitemane, where did you go!
---
You are most probably right. Didnt try to lasher farm in Classic but from my other experience you get a good amount of herbs just looting the plants. Having a boost to that number every run is a plus in my eyes tho.
---
I really enjoyed the scare beast on feral druid at the beginning.
---
Grom’gol is BiS hearthstone, hands down
---
Don't you have an army of mages selling portals in Kargath?
---
That was really fun to watch :)
---
The moment you stop caring for loot is the time you will enjoy to raid the most.
---
I mean once you get killed 5 times by someone you dont give them honour...
---
Agree. I'd love to see a list of add-ons.
---
Thousands out of multiple millions subscribed? Most subs for WoW in years? I am confused.
---
I'm on PvE server, that the real smart move, but for OP it is smart but sad...
---
I remember watching my brother raid back in 2005 and seeing tons of people on top of the at his as we ran through the hundreds of skeletons. Good Ol' Magtheridon.
---
Step 1: Be Horde.
---
we live in the age of efficiency + zoomers
---
we can see similar effects on battles and ganks on pvp servers
---
inb4 ok boomer
---
The only reason I'd want to be on the same server as streamers is so I could hunt them down and grief the crap out of them. Is there any other reason?
---
Sure there is. You must believe it every time someone on the internet claims that someone did something bad without any proof. Cancel culture fan I guess.
---
Won't help on our server.
---
Funny, i left stalagg with my guild as horde to heartseeker and we are having a blast, the alliance are so bad its not even funny. Being the underdog is so much more fun that being the dominant faction.
---
Does deep wounds actually work on Rag?  I thought elementals were immune to bleeds.
---
It could be so that everyone in his group left instead him leaving.
---
Hehehe i bought a bunch of sentry cloak and feet of the lynx for like 10g each (bit more for cloak), now i'm selling the' 40g to filthy twinks ! STONKS ↗️
---
i didnt say that. i said that cht max dmg is higher than shanker.
---
it wasnt about if cht is better than shanker. it was about if the difference between shanker and cht in mainhand is bigger than the difference between cht and distracting in offhand :)
---
Ah, thanks for clarification. And my bad on calling them APEX instead of APES, i do watch Hydra and tribes sometimes.
---
*looks at Jerry the OT next week in raid*
---
Jerry... when the fuck did you get [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]....
---
I'm ready to pay $100 bucks for a transfer and being able to play again.
---
I doubt the Horde will have anyone left to kill in two weeks from now.
---
You can also queue from the actual BG entrances in hillsbrad, arathi and the barrens / ashevale
---
There never was any skill involved in vanilla pvp anyways. Arenas were very much a welcome addition.
---
I fish Nightfin in moonglade before logging off. Not exactly top tier gold making, but you don't have to pay attention either so you're free to do whatever.
---
Midnight hits, teleport moonglade, catch som juicy fish while watching netflix etc
---
It's not much but it's honest work. About 8+ gold for 20 servings of soup, and you catch perhaps 40-60 per hour.
---
Banned because targeting Asmongold only, Makes sense. Also he did some shit behind the scenes.
---
Viande. Nice name 🥩🍖
---
I thought hard breaking the RP experience of others was a bannable offense on RP servers?
---
Madness
---
Fun game
---
Thanks for the info. Just recently thought about starting on one of the "full" servers, but seeing  things like this turn me away. Don't have time during night to lvl anyways so it would probably take months to level (less so with bg's out i guess.)
---
I'm on Grobbulus! I was a Nelf priest the first time around (lol I know), but this time I'm playing the opposite, fulfilling my bloodlust as a Horde warrior!
---
Im tired of this bullshit, Im PvPing almost every day and literally no-one will corpse camp you for 30 minutes.  
---
1st its boring, 2nd it gains no honor, and 3 of you stop moving opposite faction will wipe you. Theres absolutely no incentive to do that.
---
I would do that instantly if possible.
---
Like I said, not doing your research for you. It's easy enough to find with a simple search but you refuse to do it so your favourite streamer isn't put in a bad light.
---
Cancel culture? Where did I say he should be cancelled? All I said was I found the clip within 1 search. I honestly don't give a fuck about Asmongold or any other streamer for that matter, I clicked this thread knowing Asmon is a hypocrite and seeing how the classic community reacted to this.
---
You mean like world quests do?
---
More so that they originaly intended to have outlands and northrend with vanilla
---
T1 bracers aren't bad but +20/21 Shadow bracers are better and Winter night is below ROTV&lt;Volatile Power
---
It sucks “rektmagelol” names and people disrupting RP are accepted.
---
you are odd. why you 'promise' that? i mean you dont provide any reason. and you didnt answer the question what source do you use. it seems like you just randomly made some stuff up and act like that suddenly are facts. i would like to here some reasons. i dont say i or this source cant be wrong. but it is not wrong cause some random guy on the internet says so without providing any evidence.
---
We do
---
I only noticed that there was no healer in range for me from 100% to 10%,  when i was watching the video.
---
Ye thats what i mean, good warlocks make sure to pull aggro asap in phase 2 to get fireballed
---
If you’re human QS is better, no questions asked. If you’re not human Eskhandar is an alright weapon to start with I guess (unless you’re orc. Orcs should use axe). With other races than orc QS is still better, but you need 9%hit or edgemasters. But alot of ppl go for dagger and gloves that give +dagger skill (cant remember what they’re called). But if you’re not human or orc and on a budget and daggers are out of the question then Eskhandar is okay
---
They were level 50.
---
Warrior has the worst leveling experience of all the classes. If you have a healer with you most of the time it’s fine, but solo is rough. 
---
In contrast, Hunter has one of the easiest leveling experiences, if not the easiest.
---
Only way you can win this, if you don't feel like rerolling, is to cancel your subscription and let them miss your 15$.
---
That would at least sum-up to 30$ (including mine)
---
I doubt bwl will be much of an issue even for pugs. It was very ahrd when it was released but all the hard parts recieved major nerfs.
---
Neither vale or broodlord will present any sort of osticle now. 
---
The 3 drakes were never hard nor will they ever be.
---
Chromaggius is probobly the last line of defense but iirc they also nerfed the impact of not having sand (stuns less often). 
---
Nerfarian was only hard if you were struggling with dps in p1. I doubt we will be struggling on that nowdays.
---
I think bwl will be fine for pugs.
---
I tried to get on the boat to theramore, stepped on, was killed. Before I could run back the boat left which means when it finishes zoning I was rezzed automatically... they didn’t find me again until the boat was almost to the dock at theramore so when I died and had to run back, the boat had left again... I took a GY Rez at menethil while chuckling at the absurdity of the situation.
---
Basically any working Auction addon.
---
Auctioneer, Auctionator, Aux...
---
Until a faction queue, similar to a battleground queue, is implemented on servers, the faction imbalance is going to exist in a radical way. And blizzard thinks the current transfer limitations will fix it hahahaha.
---
&gt;I play on a 5500 player concurrent on server in the EU which is *not* a streamer server.
---
Any actual data which supports this claim please?
---
If you don't have the balls to do that you can always ask someone to epstein you
---
How bad are you outnumbered there? I'm alliance on stalagg and it's gotten so much worse since when you transferred. Then Honor system dropped and people stopped playing or started raid logging
---
HonorSpy
---
Ask around find zones that are safe and hit it as hard as you can.  PvP shouldn’t have been a surprise for anyone. In 2 weeks it will chill out anyway don’t make a hasty decision
---
The «most likely AFK player» is also not moving her mouth while responding, whilst OP is. This means OP just typed and the other player either typed before OP or not at all (Photoshop), im leaning towards the latter.
---
It’s true that some people dont RP on RP-servers, but this is shopped for sure.
---
And not when there aren't any BGs to occupy the PVPers.
---
Same
---
Holy paladins are the best pvp healers aswell imo. Maybe im just biased as a horde mage but theres nothing more annoying then a paladin healer when fighting alliance groups.
---
Crushed that brd arena farm group.
---
Here's a version from Decimations PoV :)  
---
[https://youtu.be/-b-zzQW3GoE](https://youtu.be/-b-zzQW3GoE)
---
For one person it is.
---
I leveled as a shadow priest and these are the key binded spells I used to heal.
---
- max flash heal (to use for emergencies)
---
- max Biggest heal (for tank)
---
- smaller heal (for dps)
---
- max power ward shield 
---
- dispel
---
- remove disease
---
i am lvl 59 troll hunter and i got camped by lvl 60 night elf hunter,i was at camp mojache runing to dm and he cut my way to there and killed me,then i resed and he caught me with epic mont and so on untill i took res sciknes,and then my party got mad at me,so what should i do there ?
---
he just out runs me with epic mount scater shots me and insta kill me
---
You ask whether something is good or not, you get a reply that answers that questions to which you respond "Fuck your meta". 
---
You can raid as a ret paladin or balance druid if you really want to, but they're still defined as meme specs, I don't see how this is any different. If you don't care about whether it's competitive or not, why are you asking in the first place?
---
Yes, but what im trying to say, is that it happen on both sides.  
---
So its not only horde, like your title post is suggesting.
---
Can only agree with your post, but the fact that it takes 15$ from my bank account ruins all that to half.
---
Ah, that made me think of changing stances and checking total DPS each time. Doesn't look like crits are factored going from battle stance to bezerk stance.
---
Yeah man, I'm with you. The old Blizzard is dead and buried and never coming back. But I honestly feel like the Classic team is trying their hardest to give us what we want. They're fucking things up, but as far as I'm concerned I'm just glad to be back in the game in some way.
---
I’m guessing this is just a dungeon list and not a raid list, hence why MC and BWL are not on the list
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if they planned to make kara a dungeon and bt a dungeon in ”old outland” initially in vanilla but scrapped it
---
What do you mean?
---
There is no good database for the specific 1.7 itemization. 
---
"The Tier 2 warrior Helm of Wrath originally had Spirit and Agility on it, as well as critical strike chance. In Patch 1.5.0, the helm’s stat budget was changed to Stamina, Strength, and Defense, along with elemental resistances. Then in Patch 1.7.0, the amount of Defense on the helm was reduced. In Patch 1.8.0, the 5-piece set bonus that included the helm was fixed to work with Whirlwind, and in 1.9.0, it got a better look with an art update."
---
a quote from Blizzard gives one example of stat changes. But there were tons of these, and most of them were optimized throughout the games original lifespan all the way up to TBC.
---
Atleast the class tier-sets in aq40 + naxx were replaced by the same tokens they later used in every raid from tbc onward. So as long as you have any fair lootsystem and  keep up your attendance, you should absolutely be able to complete your t2.5/t3 sets. Weapons and things like accessories are a different matter, thats why guilds use dkp or loot council. 
---
The beauty of it is exactly that you dont get to see every single warrior/ret/shaman running around with might of menethil in p6+, some items just stay rare, which makes them feel much more special. But you really dont need to have that "one" absolute bis item in every single slot, there are several viable items for each slot, some bis items for some specs can even come from 5mans, quest rewards, pvp rewards, ect. Having bis or "just" second/third-bis in a few some slots still makes much less of a difference to your max dps than crit/proc luck does.
---
I've been quite lucky with my rogue. I've never raided in old vanilla so when I ran MC with my guild, I managed to win rolls on 3 T1 rogue pieces. But yeah, it feels good when you see your guildmates get their pieces as well.
---
I literally just asked about the weapons. Are the weapons good together or not. I didn't even mention my spec.
---
Well, brave of you to insult widely and broadly and expect the thread not to get buried.
---
Not a complainer myself as somewhat selfishly these problems dont affect me, but if people are unhappy they are free to voice that. Complaining about complaining is just bound to create a circle of never-ending complaining, where someone else is gonna complain about your complaint, which in turns is gonna get further complaints and so on.
---
Don't step in the red
---
lmao. don't cry
---
Assuming they don't just climb up the hill south of the stable in Dun Baldar bypassing the bridge entirely.
---
15 bucks back then was a lot harder for me to come across than 15 bucks now, so at least there's that lol
---
OCE RP realm would make me a happy 🐼
---
Quel - more threat and more stamina. Only redeeming factor is attack speed, but quel is fast enough with 2.0 speed
---
Because it doesnt do anything illegal mechanic wise.
---
Your random threath meter is likely more intense and shady pile of code.
---
The ppl who said that were either noobs or ppl basing their claims on 15 year old vanilla memories. 
---
Any1 who had spent some time on a private realm knew how far the meta had progressed from the vanilla time and were already betting on rag falling week one. (althou apes still surprised us by doing it 3 days faster than expected).
---
Is he a group of 20 lvl 60's camping a fp ?
---
Looks so neat. 
---
Do you have a elv ui string you want to share ? :)
---
Cindy? Seriously?
---
Funny weird thing that happened to me at lbrs entrance  : got feared , loading screen but instead of being inside lbrs i was zoned into a instanced version of the outsides
---
How much +hit does a fury warrior with 307 weapon skill need? I assume this changes depending on the level of the mob.
---
Why down vote this guy?  These people who can’t pick a main should look at what they are doing. The first guy could have 2 60’s and one almost 60 but instead he has none because he can’t commit to one at a time.  And it’s true if all you want to do is level alts a pve server would be perfect.
---
&gt;they where too dumb
---
hahaha
---
Yes...what are you trying to say? That I'm not allowed to set my hearthstone to SW to save time traveling because IF is the "capital city"? There's an AH, Bank, trainers, forge, ect ect in SW. Why is it so farfetched that someone would use SW as their main hub? I'm not the only one, there's plenty of other alliance players in SW all the time when I'm there.
---
Shield Slam is the last talent in the prot tree...
---
Hello,
---
Well  I have willey's portable howitzer in the bank and I'm using the heartseeking crossbow now. Base damage is close to the howitzer but lower speed means more damage with autoshots. I follow a rotation so the number of autoshots is quite fixed. Anciend bone bow, while veeeeery sexy, is worse in this scenario.
---
Cheers!
---
&gt; Not just technically, in every way.
---
I already explained the significance which a competent English speaker should extract from it. If you don't get it I am sorry but the problem is on your end.
---
&gt; Your argument is self-evidently problematic too. It's almost like being circular and begging the question are wrong!
---
I feel like you read a web page on critical thinking and are now just spouting terms you found on it mad libs style. My argument definitely is not circular, whatever else it is.
---
&gt; You can construct a million problems out of any change ever. That is never an argument against change in and of itself, and it is not useful to expend more energy thinking about problems to change that you have deemed essential.
---
I imagine you about to walk into an open manhole and responding to warnings with "you can construct a million reasons why I should not take another step forward, but that is never an argument against stepping forward in and of itself, nor is it useful for you to expend energy thinking about it". And so you step forward and fall right into the hole, because the hole does not care about your attempts to handwave its significance away.
---
&gt; What the fuck is this statement even lmao. Ethics apply to everything, they don't selectively apply depending on the scale of the stakes.
---
Then feel free to spend a million dollars of your own money returning a stolen penny to a crime victim.
---
&gt; What an extremely myopic way of viewing the situation. 
---
It's not my fault you made a foolishly extreme statement which could be trivially shown to be false. That's not me being myopic, it's you being idiotic.
---
&gt; You cannot effectively calculate the opportunity cost of players lost after being scammed for a lot of money, for instance, or players who are put off by the sheer possibility of being scammed.
---
That destroys your argument then. Well done. If this supposed cost cannot be quantified it cannot be a basis for action.
---
&gt; Again, they managed to pull off having better customer support when their project was nowhere near as succesful.
---
Once again you are assuming what you need to be proving, which is that their policies changed because they are evil and lazy rather than because their old policies were exploitable and unsustainable.
---
There shouldn't be forced RP but they should enforce naming. Seeing your typical lol meme names on a RP server is crap.
---
I bought Krol blade the moment I could afford it. I could only play 2 hours per night so I didnt feel like spending time on running UBRS over and over again to get the MH Dal Rend. Krol blade is worth it.
---
The question was whether it was good or not. Compared to arms, it's not good. But for fury, it's pretty much as good as it gets
---
On ZT there's a chat channel "LFRP" to look for specific things. A lot of guilds also focus on RP. But if you're solo there's no way you are going to find RP just by accident. Most people, including RPers, are OOC while doing normal gameplay.
---
&gt;It's a pretty shallow look at RP if controlling how you look is the most important thing to people.
---
Customizing a character is a HUGE part of roleplaying.
---
If I am roleplaying a character then I've got a specific look for that character in mind. Setting up my toon's optics is highly important to me, and many, if not most players - not just roleplayers - want to be able to customize their character's outfit. Not for the same reasons, of course; some want to show off the cool set they created, others want to brag with rare drops or show off how far they got in raids or PVP, and yet others imagine their toon to have a specific job or role (that is why it's called roleplaying, after all) and want to dress it up appropriately. And that's all cool.
---
But you also need to wear practical armor that actually increases your stats. Without transmog (or at least something like visual-only armor slots), you can't make your character look different while keeping your stats that are so important for gameplay. So if you want to use a specific outfit, you will have to carry it around with you at all times (taking up a ton of bag space), and change outfits when you switch between RP and gameplay. This makes random RP encounters a worse experience. Who wants to change their outfit just to talk to people in character? And even outside of RP, what if your random combination of stat gear just looks like ass? Do you want your toon to look like a clown?
---
And being able to get haircuts is just another tool to customize your character to your liking.
---
It's about the personal experience. So yes, getting a haircut *does* improve your RP experience, and increases your interactions because you're more willing to actually RP if your character looks the way you want it to.
---
Yup, that's what this is except with BRD.
---
Aq requires some preparations thou. You need a meat wall of players with nr gear for one boss etc. 
---
And trying to organize positions on cthun p1 for a pug will be quite annoying. 
---
Sure the more organized pugs might have the patience to get it right. But i think alot of pugs will be falling apart already on huhuran or twins.
---
Don’t worry battlegrounds will be cross-faction! 
---
Blizzard made sure people won’t suffer any drawbacks from being on the faction with x2+ the population of the other faction. The large majority of their player base is horde lol, can’t risk pissing them off
---
Is this sarcastic? Otherwise i guess it depends heavily on who you encounter or what server you are, what i see ingame is nothing like the toxicity i was part of on csgo for exemple.
---
Barons mount has a staggering 0.02% drop chance. It got increased to 1% in Wotlk or something.
---
Thats 1 in every 5000 kills. I've yet to see a single player running around on that mount.
---
&gt;and fears
---
Sorry, but Horde is "not-undead" faction.
---
They sap him first so he loses debuff
---
Bgs are cross-faction though
---
Have you tried retail wow? It has absolutely no issues like you described.
---
advertise 2020
---
But can it solve the faction imbalance problem?
---
Lmao this whole thread is like talking to a wall. What a bunch of brooms
---
lul tinfoil twat/hat
---
I made the switch to a PVE server. It hurts a lot because i got my character to level 55, but I just couldn't level any more. I'm just to old and have to much going on in real life to waste in wpvp. If anything, the faction imbalance is only going to get worse before any steps are taken to rectify things. BG's I'm definitely excited for though.
---
So they are basically trying to recoup some of their cost for the service? I can get behind that
---
I agree.
---
The only Thing that really VASTLY changed in the last 15 years is how entitled People are nowadays. 
---
Technology and stuff makes People just always demand the best because it is easily available for them if they are really looking for it.
---
&gt;But I'm not trying to WPvP
---
You're not allowed to do that. If you rolled on PvP server - you have to PvP 24/7 apparently.  
---
Yeah, it doesn't look particularly profitable. It's possible to kill the water elemental as well, but it still looks like 20g/hour to me. One or two boss kills and a couple of rich thorium veins in 20 minutes is not very lucrative. Personally, I just farm the undead under Karazhan for 25g/hour, loads of potions and runecloth, and a chance at high-end epics like Cloudkeepers and Hand of Ed.
---
Yeah most of the people I met in game were super nice and helpful. Of course there were some a-holes here and there. I encountered more impatient and raging people when I was in the 50-60 range, but it was still bearable and those people quit the dungeon anyway midway.
---
Other than that, nice people everywhere.
---
20 20ghour 25ghour a a and and and and as at boss but chance cloudkeepers couple doesnt ed elemental epics farm for hand highend i in is it it its just karazhan kill kills like like loads look looks lucrative me minutes not of of of one or particularly personally possible potions profitable rich runecloth still the the thorium to to two undead under veins very water well yeah
---
Says the UD rogue on a horde dominated server
---
How so? We have one of the most balanced servers in the whole game.
---
Not that smart imo. There is no way to gear a main to be able to keep pace with the phases if you have not been 60 on at least one character. You could go weeks of raiding without getting gear and no 60 means no raids. Rested Xp doesn’t make you level faster either. You have to be logged out for 8 hours to get 1 bar of rested and it takes 10 days to get maxed on rested 1 1/2 bars.  After level 40 even a slow player should be able to get a level every 2 hours /played if they are questing and not running around with no real plan.
---
Mage is the best all rounder.
---
Thanks! I'm thinking of just waiting till after BG and see if the open world calms down a bit. If not I'm starting a Hunter on a PvE realm.
---
I also had a great run in BRD the other day. Was just running some 53-56 through BRD, hitting up all the quests. We didn't make it past the Lyceum and I was only there to kill Emp really. But it was great teaching new players how pulls/bosses worked.  
---
I guess I just need to try harder to find WoW Classic experiences I'm looking for. It's just a shame the standard playstyle just seems to be about completing your BiS list and anything which doesn't achieve that goal is a 'waste of time'.
---
&gt; The desire for achievement and to be making progress is how we ended up with retail. Many people want it.
---
Yeah I totally get it. I really like the daily quests in HS and Dota Underlords for example. Content treadmills are hard to get right and I'm sure some things I hate in Classic WoW I probably like in other games.
---
Though I think my opinion on the 'super optimal' playstyle has definitely soured a bit since P2. The Honor farmers are essentially making certain game content completely unavailable to me.  
---
- Want to level in the open world 48-60?   
---
- Want to farm some mobs in Winterspring/Ungoro/Felwood/EPL?  
---
- Want to run BRD but don't have the time for that + the 30-45 minutes it might take you to just get in? 
---
Well you can't. Honor farmers are there and they won't let you.  
---
It feels other players race to R14 has completely closed off some content for me.
---
sorry for your experience.  
---
But your personal experience doesnt reflect the game and its actualy state and community.
---
I have a nice guild. yeah we have some drama from time to time, but thats life.  
---
We play togheter, and it feels we are becoming closer as a gruop and we enjoy playing toghether.
---
&gt; But what pisses me off the most is the insane hatred for Retail WoW. 
---
You shouldnt care about other peoples opinions man.  
---
I know its easy to say, and probally its not goign to help you, but stop wastign your energy on somebodies opinion.  
---
Being vocal, doesnt mean they are right tho... let them be ignorant, and yuo are the bigger men, if you ignore them
---
&gt;  I really wonder why LFG Tools are such a troublemaker for WoW, 
---
Vanilla is all about community, and making effort to get things done.  
---
if you want to group-up, and clear some Dungeons, you have to make an effort, and look out for a group being made, or create a group yourself. No toolings or such.. its about making the effort... and the reward in the end will feel more rewarding, because you made an effort... not sayign thats the case for you, but its the case for the mayority of the vanilla/classic players
---
&gt; Retail does not really have a community anymore 
---
And that all started with --&gt; flying mounts. Dungeonfinder/raidfinder  
---
and auto teleport to dungeons..... you literly dont have to make any effort at all
---
&gt;  than a horrible negative community. 
---
Sounds you realy had a bad group where you where playinh and again, your personal experience is no way near the actualy Classic community, but a stupid minority that kinda ruined your experience.
---
Because it is your choice, if you play on a pvp server you choose to be a free target almost everywhere in the world.
---
My wife doesnt like it and she started on a pve server and has no problems with p2.
---
Playing on a pvp server pretty much says "I agree with being ganked and having to deal with pvp even if I dont like it".
---
Sorry zero sympathy for people who play on pvp servers but dont like pvp, its like going to MC Donalds despite not liking cheap fastfood, in my opinion you dont have the right to complain since you had the free choice in the beginning.
---
I am all in for pvp and I enjoy playing on pvp server even if it means I get ganked and lose my worldbuffs right before the raid.
---
heh so what you are saying is: To hold agro I became a DPS.
---
"litErAlLy CaN'T gAnK zEpPeLiNs"  
---
meanwhile I died 4 times yesterday while on a Zepp. No guards there to do anything
---
and yet they didn't wait for the honorless debuff to go... :D
---
Just soulstone 1 sec before they die from dots. Does that give honor ?
---
HahahahHAAAAAA
---
Hey . I have a lvl 60 rogue and thinking to make an alt. I want i to be caster  but here os the stuggle. My favorite class is mage but that is out of question since there are tons of mages, so i came down to 2 classes : lock or priest. As a priest, i want to play shadow since is so good in pvp but i m afraid that finding a spot in a raid will be very hard, if im gonna heal for raids that will be very tough too since i will need 2 sets of gear, one for healing and one for pvp as shadow. And about warlock, it feels like a pain with so many spells and curses but maybe i will like it. Out of these 2 i would prefer spriest but i want to hear your thoughts.
---
Well, it has never been a secret that enh is one of the very worst specs in vanilla. I don't know why so many people insist on playing it. It's F-tier in PvP and PvE.
---
It could be inevitable either way though.  Offering transfers in any capacity will impact total population/faction balance, but not allowing it will lead to a lot of the same people rerolling or quitting anyways.
---
Yeah that's basically it. You need to be able to control the mobs some way.
---
I completely forget about fear as a form of CC to be honest. Since it can't be used whenever you want.
---
And I don't think I've seen a Warlock actually using their pet in ages :P. I generally see the Succubus very briefly before they die horribly for that sweet Shadow dmg buff.
---
I guess it comes down to personal preference. I came across many opportunities were I could have scored some easy kills but I choose not to go for them because I also see the receivers point of view. If it happens to me its frustrating so I avoid doing it. 1v1s are rare but even 2v1s are sort of manageable to some degree; unlike death squads and corps camping.
---
You need the correct rod for the correct level range.
---
originally in vanilla the idea was for dishonorable kills to be for killing lowbies etc, but this was never actually implemented.  Largely because it would be too open to abuse, so the implementation we actually saw was with dishonorable kills just being certain quest npcs etc in towns.
---
This.
---
Plus the min max mentality and the knowledge about the game that make it less fresh than it was back then.
---
Having a blast since day one, but I am afraid underpopulated faction don't share this feeling, I hope Iam wrong tho.
---
BGs are grouped in server clusters so you won’t notice it while queuing for them. In your own world, the numbers won’t change but you will see less of the high level players because they will be queuing WSG or AV if they want to honor grind
---
Ah, my bad! Distracting Dagger gives you plenty of dagger skill which is very valuable regardless and more important than Barman’s Shanker for your dps. As dagger spec you are especially reliant on white damage.
---
Look at me... I’m the captain now
---
True, totally forgot about the buff. A min/max guild can surely put out over 30k dps on that fight.
---
&gt;And duskwood, red-ridge, and wetlands are entirely Horde honor farm zones.
---
Fixed.
---
unlike the wrong decision he made to roll a pvp server when he can't take being killed.
---
Why do people care about this?
---
Hey, did you ever get it to work? I haven't played classic WoW in awhile now but I basically had the same issue as you and gave up. Just couldn't get it to work.
---
Not much you can do there if the party isn’t willing to come help kill him. Only option is to just keep pushing forward and corpse running until you get there
---
well i did get t2 helm after our tank and our 1 other healer who had shit, and salamander scale pants first
---
the other paladins in the guild have nearly half of t1 tho, our 1 resto druid is pretty much in full t1
---
&gt;back in BC
---
Alliance wasn't even a faction in TBC, lol.
---
Rerolling atm and in deep shadow, this works fine.
---
Maybe don't go in dungeons that you would otherwise do on holy spec, wait like 1 or 2 more levels, but overall it's fine.
---
If the group is very good, imp vampiric embrace healing can even be enough. You'll drink a lot but you're a Shadow Priest, It's expected.
---
Well I've done 6 MC runs as a priest and not been given anything so yeah I feel ya
---
Im kinda against it, im actually kinda pissed that they still do full damage after the warlock dies, but thats probably just me as a warrior.
---
I just hate it when i actually win a duel against a warlock / shadow priest, got 50%hp left and still die after somehow getting 1 or 2 ticks from my bandage off and start eating afterwards.
---
So in our last raid cloudkeeper legplate droped 😉. Our main fury warrior was happy
---
take the free transfer to a lower pop server..
---
Lol that's fucking sad tbh.
---
In my experience (as a whispering healer) this depends on your way of going about it. If you're polite and talk to the person you're whispering a bit more than just a braindead "HEY, TANK SCHOLO??" you usually get a decent reply back and with some luck, people do tend to join if they have something they might need from there and they're not terribly busy at the time. 
---
In a good number of cases, me and the tank have both ended up adding each other to Friends after finishing the run, since I think both sides stand to gain something from having access to a reliable tank or healer - I arguably have more to gain, since tanks are fewer in number than healers are, as has ever been. That's why I try to go that extra distance with totem twisting, interrupts and maxing my utility while healing any dungeon. If they notice that, chances are they'll remember it and tag along or invite you again. Having a number of good tanks (and DPS) on your Friends list is super nice, and if you can make some friends in the process, greater still.
---
This is just based on my experience though.
---
Yes it could literally kill someone.
---
In theory yes, in practice most likely no
---
To make it simple:
---
Ony has a 7 day reset timer and there'll just drop 1 item. Your item has a 5 % chance to drop
---
After 52 tries, the chance that your item won't drop a single time is: 6.94428 %
---
I did the same with 156 tries (3 items per kill): 0.0334875 %
---
I would reroll - why put more time into a character on a realm which has a dead faction?
---
Level ret, have a set of int gear to throw on if you have to heal. This works up until the 50s. If you leave in dungeons primarily past 50, switch to holy to heal better
---
Funny you should say that. I had the blue cape from stegosaur boss in WC (6 agi and some spirit) until I upgraded it with a quest reward in Winterspring. Must have lasted me almost 40 levels. A guildmate had put +1agi on it and I saw a couple of capes whilst levelling that had 7 agi but no spirit so I just never swapped it out.
---
that's like 5 arcanite reapers
---
In a perfect world, every expansion should persist on atleast one server, with transfering your character to TBC. Even the less popular ones can maintain some level of interest.
---
Yo guys can you please shut it. I really don't give af what you think. I DON'T CARE
---
The bosses don’t drop loot for a reason. They are in prison so they don’t have anything to drop. Except for a prison shiv, it all makes good story sense.
---
This would be a change I would be okay with.  Especially because the honorless buff goes away if you attack, so it would really only fuck over corpse campers.
---
Nah not pay to win. He doesn't gain anything someone not doing this can't get. He is just more 'effective' at it.
---
It’s not a great feud because only one of them is interested in a feud. The other just wants to play some wow with his viewers. This is a one sided grudge Grudge match that one of the contestants has 0 incentive to participate in. 
---
Why should Asmon do anything to co-sign Adverts actions? He gains nothing from their interactions whole Advertise gets to ride asmons coattails in to viewers, all while taking away from Asmons goal when he streams.
---
Because its not griefing.  
---
Make a GM ticket, and he will also say its not griefing
---
Didn't want to say it , but yes :D same here.
---
My experience is similar, elitism, min max, etc... I recall now; when i was in STV a lvl 60 horde ganking us, I asked in chat for help but people would say something like "no honor, not helping". I didn't understand it back then,  I was like who d fck cares for HP, this is about real honor.....but nah.....
---
Ever done ony on a lock?
---
Nope, troll rogue on a heartseeker, wrong on all accounts and I'm now playing on a PvE server practicing what I preach :)
---
I guess the issue is getting into the zepp and it being worth while to stay
---
Even though gathermate addon helps with mining and herbalism at the same time since nods get added to the map, it’s annoying to spam the macro and open the map back and forth to determine your path. I considered it but ruled it out since it’s a nuisance and warlock don’t have engineering. Good feedback though.
---
Nowadays it seems more like: No gold farm, pvp all day, occasionally do some Raid
---
The issue is then you have people that aren't trying to get prebis or whatever else. It's a way to encourage people to do so, and if they aren't you might as well replace them
---
Did it a few weeks ago, didn't have to attack anyone.
---
Also only detects you if you stealth in range of 50yds. Stealth outside that range, you're fine. Instead of whining you should think of ways to use this for your advantage , people seeing Stealth Warning on Spy tend to use cooldowns or overreact before you did anything.
---
RP servers probably have the youngest demographic, so seeing them giggle at Farmonster isn't very surprising.
---
Warlock - Outrange them and mana drain them, but this is a tough one
---
Rogue - Get PvP trinket, get a freezing trap macro, cc them and get range.
---
Warrior - outrange and kite. If they get cc off go defensive and try to trap/CC them.
---
Pally - They can't kill you and you can't kill them.
---
Mage - Outrange and mana drain them. Use scatter/indimidate when they blink at you or try to cast. Feign death to avoid dmg. Tough one for me.
---
sPriest - try to outrange them. If you can't just DPS and Vipers sting them. It's your Health Vs their mana. You can kill them but you might die to DoTs
---
Druid - Fear them in animal form and damage them in caster form. Not really sure about this one, they usually run away.
---
Hunter - Fear or trap pet, use cc to slow pet. Use feign death to mess up enemies attacks. You can YOLO and run in melee, sometimes catches them off guard.
---
Well tbf if your tag is right you're a tauren druid, we all know that they have a secret racial to prevent toxicity in a 30yds radius. 
---
But yeah i guess different people with different experience, one thing that might make me biased is that i'm mostly playing with guildies these days, I don't interact that much pugs.
---
Yeah it really bothers when people are obsessing over their dkp
---
Damn... I wish MC Donalds was cheap ;D
---
Ah, I assumed lookingforgroup and world were both usermade.
---
Which is still not a lot of time to make a raid, tbf.
---
warrior and rogue start to pick up at 36.
---
There's a million rogues but like 4 warriors on the server to tank.  keep that in mind.
---
Yeah since I started raiding, I mostly do dungeons with the guild and avoid all of this altogether.
---
But before I was 60, I only did PUG. It was fun 95% of the time. From 50-60 it was like 75% fun. So I guess it's based on the server and time at which you play. 
---
We also need to realize there are 13 year olds playing this game and we all know how a 13 year old kid can behave.
---

---
If anything, with layering removed, there is too many people in low level zones. You should be good to start now. PvP servers might be a rude awakening, if you're starting during the current phase 2. PvE should be fine.
---
It should proc off everything thats atleast green I think so 48+
---
"Horde has better PvP racials"
---
Wut?
---
And that's your reasoning?
---
To be fair - you should have known....  It was obvious this was going to happen in p2, and lots and lots of people were saying as such on forums like this.
---
&gt; if you want to group-up, and clear some Dungeons, you have to make an effort, and look out for a group being made, or create a group yourself. No toolings or such.. its about making the effort... and the reward in the end will feel more rewarding, because you made an effort... not sayign thats the case for you, but its the case for the mayority of the vanilla/classic players
---
You sound like a robot.
---
youre playing pn a shit server im on a rp pvp server , best experiance ever, you probably went on shazzrah or golemagg which are the twitch servers
---
You play alliance, horde will beat you enough
---
server pop 65-35 - in current set up 35% of the pop is dominated and when in game they get negative enjoyment from the game because they spend most of their time corpse running.
---
server pop 65-35 - proposed set up 30% of the pop get 0 enjoyment from the game for a SET period of time due to queue and the game becomes a challenge and more balanced over time due to transfers out etc to limit queue. 
---
both sides get subscription cancellations but arguably less cancellations come from the proposed set up.
---
Kargath is sometimes under attack. For example, yesterday around 17 server time horde was dominating searing gorge and BRM and more towards 19 ST the alliance had taken complete control. It seems like it all depends on what time of day it is. I would suspect there are more raiders on horde side than ally
---
I'd sign that. I don't get why RPers switch to classic
---
people rolled where they could actually log in in the first month
---
there are 3x as many PVP servers as PVE servers and the PVP experience is NOTHING like it was in vanilla
---
&gt; Asmon may be an asshole to people sometimes, but he never promotes harassment 
---
This is the 3rd time I'm telling you that if you search on Google or Youtube you will find a result that shows Asmongold telling people to hunt and camp Advertise.
---
yeah sorry i mean for weapons and stuff not everything
---
TIL asking for proof from people spreading misinformation makes me a slave to asmongold. You must be 14 if not I genuinely feel bad for you and those around you.
---
Thanks for the helpful expert analysis, you must have alot of shadow priest experience in vanilla.
---
Not in BGs they won't 😂
---
I mean if you don't do the research, you only have yourself to blame.
---
Also you really didn't even have to, it's obvious it would be a shitshow just by seeing what each phase contained.
---
It's generally true in my experiences, but in my RP guild there were still characters who showed up with names like Analblast. Grow up or gtfo.
---
Not sure if and when Blizzard will add transfer s. In the meantime, ransfer to a lower Pop better balanced realm.
---
Yes, having that mount gives you a good amount of swagger.
---
Does it cancel the cast if it gets pushed off?
---
Thanks, I thought there'd be a lot more posts like this in this sub. Foolish me. 😁
---
I'm loving the game. It was all I wanted in a mmorpg when it came out (EQ1 was an absolute nightmare, even if it was also fun). 
---
I have ignored a few rude individuals in chat, and a couple of douchebags I ran a dungeon with. Other than that I have found my time on my RP server to be epic. The people are great and the game is fun.
---
There's a real community building between the nice folk. If you spend time with someone and you like them, add that character to your friends list. Then keep in touch when they're online.  I've helped out and been helped out on elite quests by my friends list people.
---
I'm having a blast. 55 main and an army of alts in their 20s. And the servers not managing and kicking me at certain points in the day? Just like it did in classic - #nochanges lol
---
People not doing the research and not seeing the obvious issue with their choice and then complaining about it when they only have themselves to blame is hilarious.
---
Eh I already forgot their names. With megaservers its kinda unlikely you will encounter the same bad apples more than 2-3 times.
---
Join /world and lfg. Ask what zones are ok before flying in.  Fly to the next zone over and run to the instance instead of getting your cheeks clapped.  It doesn’t take an hour to get anywhere in wow. Buy ports and set your hearth in a smart place and you can move around pretty easy.  For horde I like to use Gromgol as my inn so I can jump on the zep real fast.
---
I believe it says anything that gives experience or yields honor. So you can definitely get it working by killing 49+ players in pvp.
---
It’s been brutal on my RP PVP server. Before the last phase people were a touch friendlier. I’ve had the opposite faction help me escape when I’ve pulled to much, help with quests, and have friendly dance offs. Now it’s a blood bath.. I’m not complaining though!
---
Or you use goldbid on bag in guild raids and have the gold proceeds go to guildbank.
---
A few bad experiences don’t neccessarily reflect the majority of the playerbase.  I’ve only had one or two sour interactions over the past few months, whereas when I used to play LoL I was guaranteed multiple shit stains a day joining a game already upset over next to nothing.
---
The go to retail spams and similar pvp slurs are working as intended if you are getting offended by it.  You have no idea whether those players actively hate/blame retail or are just teabagging you with words.  
---
My worst experience so far was joining a brd prison xp farm not realizing it was an aoe group.  I noticed long  before arriving and asked if, as a healer, there was anything special I needed to know.  Leader say just heal.  So on my flight I quickly googled it, thought I knew what was up but just in case, asked at least two more times if they needed me doing anything in particular.  Silence.  We go in, I start the prison quest, then turn it in once we clear the guards.  Strike one, apparently.  They were setting up their aoe rotation, so I would shield the first mage before we triggered the event.  Strike two, don’t shield me bro.  Ok, next pull he dies even as I’m pre casting a heal.  Leader says “1 sec”  then I’m in the cell ungrouped.  
---
I get it but just take 5 seconds to explain what you expect or tell me its not going to work out the moment I say I’ve never done this.  
---
No one has told me to kill myself or anything yet though so overall an improvement over many game communities.
---
That's why you add them to your friends list and add a note about what they did xD
---
Nope it was on the TOS in vanilla this isn't anymore.
---
Everytime I read someone saying the took X minutes to get into BRD, I lol. But mainly because its widely exagerated and today it seems to be added 30 minutes each time someone else complains about it.
---
I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. Personally I found the best guild I ever had since I lost my old one from TBC.
---
Ironman PvP servers for WoW sounds a bit intense but also a great idea too...
---
Because its not edgy kids, its everyone. Even people I know IRL which I have known for years have jumped on the retail hate train because its "so funny lol retail suxx amirite xddd". 
---
And those are 28 year old men.
---
&gt; BGs are cross server
---
This is quoted often as the holy grail that will save everything... But it won't. There aren't enough alliance-dominated pvp servers to balance out the horde dominated servers, and the populations aren't close to being comparable. Horde will still be stuck in BG queues and forced to wPvp gank to keep honor ranks.
---
Blizzard can't group pvp and pve servers, the skill difference is so massive that the pve servers would stop queueing for BGs in less than a week.
---
Can’t take being killed in a video game? You mean like 98% of the players complaining on this sub every day about pvp servers?
---
It's hard for me to let go
---
Nope. Mograine.
---
See the response by u/KevinIsNotFatUrFat 
---
I'd expect that if 30 hordes show up to gank some small alliance groups, that the next time around 30 alliance would show up to gank small horde groups. But we all know that never happens. Horde in phase 2 are literally the zerglings from starcraft.
---
He literally has 2 videos about this, my dude.
---
Sounds like a sore loser to me. Him establishing his own personal rules for how everyone else should play is entitled as fuck. 
---
If he's reasonable at all he'll be okay with doing some where he gets his way and some where he doesn't.
---
Unfortunately you need them.
---
Sounds like a group skill issue. Ask your guild for help. If they don’t help /gquit and find a better guild.
---
If you say so.
---
Bar a single individual this has not been my experience, even when playing a brand new class that I've never ever played before.
---
I've only met one of the stereotypical "shit Mage, blames everyone else in the group for not handling the mess he makes, kicks and ignores people for calling him out".
---
But it was hilarious because he then spent half an hour in /world looking for other and half an hour later he was HS'd to a city. He'd obviously been as toxic a prick to the second group as he'd been to the first.
---
he thinks playing on a pvp server is hardcore
---
Nothing was stated as a matter of fact.
---
Every incomplete data set is inaccurate therefore all statistics are useless (according to you)
---
If you logout reset after your 5th instance, you actually get a free hearth that doesn't put it on cd, even if it was available.
---
No it says "after killing a target that yields experience"
---
Thanks. Maybe this was changed in TBC or Wotlk.
---
Right. If they care enough to post here they will be back. Or they are lying about quitting.
---
The rules say no stream sniping. If you are using a proxy to stream snipe, that’s just breaking the rules with extra steps.
---
UBRS isn't really a raid if that's what you're thinking. Look up a rend/jed run
---
Play retail then if you want no interaction and your feelings get hurt by people you will never meet
---
Sounds like you met a liar
---
When you do it to 2 specific players for 3 months..... yes... yes it is. Is that really so hard to understand?
---
I'm on the lower pop server already.
---
Wow, you're so cool. And you don't seem like you're 8 years old. Not at all, I tell you!
---
Grow up.
---
No he's not, he's talking about the guards at the zeplin tower outside Undercity, that will continue to shoot you through the walls of the Zeplin from the tower until you are out of range. If you stand against a wall the knockback doesn't send you off the zeplin.
---
The 'Community' of vanilla WoW was garbage just as bad as it is now, the point was that vanilla wow and classic wow are the kind of games that encouraged you creating your own community, a good guild, players you regularly played with, tanks/healers that you enjoyed doing dungeons with. That is what people are talking about when they reference community not every neckbeard random that happened to roll on your server.
---
Meanwhile paladins are completely insane PvP healers, but yeah sure it's uneven because horde have better racials...
---
Consider this: So far, classic raids has been easier than private server ones. Adding to that, AQ40/Naxx was successfully cleared by pugs on private servers (albeit mostly by Naxx clearing guild alts in coop raids).
---
I wouldn't be too surprised if we will see that in classic aswell.
---
If that could be combined with a faction-based queue (not happening but we can dream), that would work well. People would be motivated to swap over.
---
But otherwise? Why would you transfer from the ganking side to the ganked side? Not finding any good pvp is a lot better than not getting to play at all. It would only start working when a large amount of people flip sides - the first people to do it would suffer.
---
eh.. AV soon though, same bonus speed quiver
---
(downvoting me wont change anything :D)
---
Whatever you want! That’s the purpose of having 2 sets, as ret gear will cover your tanking gear until end game where plate is required, and the int gear covers healing
---
Half the raid roasters transfer away is just as bad as half the raid team stuck in 6 hour queue. You'd kill many of the large pop server that way since there are very little ally on them
---
Make the weakaura sound the Wilhelm scream.
---
or honor
---
Gehennas is crazy overpopped with horde lol.
---
They possibly got more riffraff than they needed.
---
You aren't playing vanilla wow, you are playing Classic. And Classic is far from the greatest game ever made.
---
The racial difference is marginal at best, if it even exists
---
do you have to pay for a free trial?
---
I'm using the default raid UI and I haven't noticed that. I guess I'll double check tonight.
---
&gt; Especially considering he used, uh sorry, clicked Reck.
---
Oh noes, he didnt have a keybind for a 30 minute cooldown ability! CLICKER!
---
SHAME!
---
if you are the only warlock in the raid and the debuff slots aint used it okay but another warlock using is more boss dmg. but that all depends if you are assigned a debuff slot to being with. if are not given a debuff slot. you taking a slot is disrespectful to the raid leaders
---
You can hear sound by reading text ? damm you are good.
---
Also good argument, regarding the post.  
---
Maybe you are just salty from your bad experience.  
---
I would like to suggest to take a few days or weeks off from playing WoW and play a game you know 100% you can enjoy... and maybe after that try WoW again and see how its goes.... at this point you are being frustrated by your area, and as a result, you are frustrating your area as well....
---
Someone’s absolutely horrible at surrounding themselves with like minded people. Or maybe really good at it? 
---
There’s plenty of casual guilds out there that focus on having fun and being a good community, but if you don’t seek them out, that’s on you.
---
This is EXACTLY the attitude I mean. This insane exclusionary force that tries to invalidate any and all criticisms of their holy Classic, hallowed be thy name.
---
Nah man. It's more like owning a gun. So by owning a gun, you know it's dangerous and can kill someone. So if your kid gets your gun and fools around and shoots himself or anyone, it's kinda your fault for buying the gun in the first place. If there is no gun, there is no shooting.
---
Im honestly not sure if he actually read the post in detail, some answers skip right over half of the point...
---
Wait, they aren't 800 million? I got scammed. Thank you TSM.
---
Most people i encounter are actually pretty friendly and its fin grouping with random people to quest or dungeon. The d bags are few and far between
---
Nah, Benediction will get you trained faster than a Hand of Rag will
---
https://imgur.com/xEPAEYD.jpg
---
Exactly. And look how awful and juddery it made his movement. I didn't notice the click, it was the moving that made it noticeable.
---
Yea its skill issue but still annoying. 10 min run to dungeon after died is way too much. You gonna run 5 min inside it after. It feels like working 2 hours to get 10 min of fun.
---
Horde rogues’ opinion is completely irrelevant
---
How about saying "hey I'll literally pay you to swap faction"?
---
Im taking a break until 10th december when battlegrounds are released. I just feel like world pvp wont be as chaotic after that (playing on a server with 75 percent horde population feels like a ghost running simulator), since more people will do battleground instead.
---
Btw, i distinctly remember you casting buffs on me while mindcontrolling me. Several people in here says thats impossible, while others say it is. How did you do it exactly? Is it like a macro or something? :p
---
Nostalrius was a mega server there were 10x more people there than any current live server. It was a shit show 24/7
---
*Laughs in Horde*
---
And they are in safe zones
---
&gt;people rolled where they could actually log in in the first month
---
i mean i guess a lot of people did that? most people i know had planned servers they were going on for various reasons. sure they can't predict what the faction balance will be like but it wasn't just "what doesn't have a 10k person queue". and thats a shitty reason to join a server anyway, queues lasted what a week tops except on the absolute biggest servers, and some of the larger servers that would have like 500 person queues
---
Full Naxx BiS forever gear.
---
*Laughs in Garithos*
---
The aesthetics were big back in the day.  There is a reason they implemented transmogrification.  It didn’t exist at the time so you could be optimal in hodgepodge gear or you could have not bis( but more than good enough) but sick looking gear.
---
Lol this makes it even worse, mograine horde side at least is amazing, I ran 3 dungeons last night and each and every one of them was an absolutely lovely experience. I’m in a super nice and friendly guild that’s still pugging their way while our members rank up and we fill up the guild. 
---
And I’m really not sure why you’d care if others say “go to retail” that really doesn’t impact you whatsoever lol
---
We were escorting another guild and decided to form up while waiting for them to land :)
---
Oh hush classic shouldn’t either the servers are massively overpopulated for what they were designed for
---
That is the person looking for RP. Closing off the conversation in an rp way or straight up ignoring the person is way better than breaking someone’s immersion
---
This. 100%
---
Not kinda it 100% wipes your threat
---
Anything that would give xp. Still procs at 60.
---
Honestly, my time on private has been a lot more fun.
---
You’ve just been exposed there way too many times
---
Congratulations! 
---
I assume you got both bindings? I'm working towards the hammer myself, up to 24 bars now. Our raid group has had 2 eyes and 1 side of the binding so far so it's a big scramble for bars in the guild.
---
Did you farm them yourself or did the guild chip in?
---
I say it too.  Nightelf warrior on atiesh.
---
If you clear to the last boss, mining for sure. Of course it might be different if arcane crystal are worth less on your server tho
---
Worked out well for us all then!!
---
That’s the thing: MF’s debuff is the slow effect and the damage gets dealt regardless of the debuff being pushed off or not.
---
Maybe I am just really picky. Ive encountered pretty much every guild type there is to encounter from super casual not-even-raiding to mythic progress guilds. And there was always something wrong, whether it was general attitude, certain members under protection from higher ups or guild-killing events.
---
Yes, that's my point: and the fault lies with alliance who transferred out of it to other servers (which likely are alliance overpopulated now since it was the initial goal of people who transferred).
---
On herod, BL goes for about 120g
---
&gt;not so well for alliance
---
It works for alliance with the newly discovered slam technique.
---
Anyone have any fun uses for Sentry Totem?
---
I am using auctioneer, and it takes about 35 min for an AH scan on my bank alt. Will this update AH info for all of my characters on this server, or do I need to do a scan on each one? Thanks!
---
TBF, you do not appear to be a priestess so "Elune-adore" as a greeting would be pretty uncommon. A more common greeting as a Night Elf commoner would be *Ishnu-alah* or *Ishnu-dal-dieb* ("Good fortune to you" and "Good fortune to your family," respectively).
---
i have seen several on dreadmist
---
i guarantee they haven't...played less, maybe. probably. but this didn't just come outta knowhere, they knew it was coming and what it would probably be like, smart ones rushed to 60 or are living in dungeons. and i know its shitty to dungeon in your 50s unless your low 50s or 58-59 but its better to do that than get rekt all the time in the world. or just quest/grind in off hours, will prob still die but far less. it sucks sure, but what are you gonna do, "oh I got to level 55 but I keep dying a bunch to 60s guess i'm gonna quit the game?"
---
in terms of "time investment", sure, maybe for you, but not for everyone. the people i see enjoying this game the most are private server vets who have done all this shit multiple times and love doing it again, the whole "15 year old game" argument is dumb, especially since there are so many people who haven't done it at all, or the fact that people who have done it multiple times are doing it once again and loving it.
---
Exactly my point. You're not better for playing on either server, nor worse. Play what is fun for you and that's it.
---
Cow for sure, undead if your not instantly mootivated by the thought of being glorious taur.
---
No, it doesn't.

His bully like persona speaks to people, either due to being bully victims, and now feeling part of that elusive bully clique, or because they are themselves bullies, seeking confirmation. I do accept that it is indeed a persona. I for one wish he'd just drop it and act like he does in his more serious youtube videos. But that's never gonna happen. His current persona is likely a strong contributer to why he's so popular right now, with abrasiveness being venerated.
---
 Play retail then if you want no interaction and your feelings get hurt by people you will never meet. Sorry your so soft a video game hurts your feelings but that's not everyone not even half of the people who play. 
---
&gt; This is EXACTLY the attitude I mean. This insane exclusionary force that tries to invalidate any and all criticisms of their holy Classic, hallowed be thy name. 
---
Are you trolling, or serious ?  
---
because you are making a kind of ass comment to me, where Chinesehoneypot is responding to, and pointing you out, and you are in defense mode:  
---
&gt; This is EXACTLY the attitude I mean. 
---
NO, thats your attitude, and its being pointed ut to you, which you cannot handle it seems.  
---
This has nothing to do with the Vanilla/Classic community, but it this particulair case its 100% you.
---
You should realy take a brake from this game, because by all means, it looks like its affecting your attitude !
---
I'm sorry. What?
---
I smell sweat and Mountain Dew
---
&gt; I won't be able to keep up with good geared dw warriors
---
You'll leave them in the dust for trash clear time. And trash is important too.
---
Honestly I think most people playing who used to play are making up for their shortcomings from back when they used to, myself included. They are trying to make better choices, do the right farms, minmaxing their gear.
---
They're trying to be a better player than they used to be. The problem is that these people also think this gives them superiority over other players because they're playing better than everyone else used to. But the people they played with/against are doing the same power gaming that they are so they aren't steamrolling everyone else like they expected to.
---
I'm just happy to be playing the game and glad I can help the people out who are new by giving guidance and a helping hand to keep up.
---
Please define "massively overpopulated"?
---
Shouldn't be rewarded for being a parasite
---
The ratio doesn’t really matter. What matters is what numbers each faction has on the map fighting. The first week horde got slaughtered everywhere, and I mean everywhere. There was no where a horde player could be without running into a Zerg. There were no even fights to be had. 
---
Apparently there are way more pvp (and RP) oriented players on ZT (a) than (h).
---
There are 2 caps, yellow and white. Yellow means all abilities and 2hand attacks, white means duelwield white hits. The cap for yellow with 305+ weapon skill is 6%, and the cap for white is always yellow +19%.
---
So before 6% hit is massive, and you definitely need minimum 6% hit. Anything above that does help but not much.
---
There's a trick with heroic strike that allows you to only need the yellow cap, but I don't really feel like explaining it right now, you can join the warrior discord and read FAQ's for more info.
---
I hate pvp as much as the next guy but your idea blows 
---
what you actually want is a pve server where you have to flag for pvp 
---
blizzard failed at not letting you and others transfer
---
I just dont like the fact that you cant evade this retail-hatred, because I myself still enjoy it. Cant even say "uh.. I kinda actually like retail" or you risk getting ridiculed for it.
---
Most other realms float in a 60:40\~70:30 range. Heartseeker is beyond 80:20, and it's in both sides interest to remedy this.
---
2v1, 3v1 fights can be engaging and fun, but 5+v1 is neither for either side. If you haven't played on a realm that skewed, you really don't fully understand the consequences.
---
Check ingame please. Now I'm not sure anymore.
---
Im a simple man, i see sad streamers i downvote
---
yes
---
Because people in BGs would be able to afk honor farm easier. Imagine going to wsg and trying to die in the middle. Then set up something to stop you from afking out.
---
alliance town dont spawn guard?
---
this happens to horde as well all the time. i get constantly killed by 3 lvl 60s on my lvl 50 twink. take it like a man god
---
Not a permant solution to the problem since soulstone is only up every 30 minutes.
---
so the bracer thing is 1% crit vs felheart (stats + 13 sp) vs 20/21 shadow dam. the shadow dam are probably better in general yes but i'd personally rather have the felheart for the stats + sp over pure SP since i really lack in stam/int because of all the dumbass BiS shadow wrath greens. honestly it probably is a very minute DPS loss but whatever lol
---
But classic is the closest thing we have to vanilla. I dont understand the hate. If you dont enjoy it then why are you playing is what I'd say to the people shitting on it constantly.
---
Hi, I'm a Paladin in one of the better Raid Guilds on Gehennas EU. I don't know much about the warrior aspect if he pops one of those Potions that make Aoe damage, what gear he using etc. however we always advise to:
---
\- Lay on hands (Improved version) on the Add tanking Warrior for the Armor Buff
---
\- The tank does not use a Flask 
---
\- The Add Tank Pop's Shield Wall when Garr is at 50% (no idea tho why I just hear it on Discord). 
---
\- 1-2 Healer on Garr Tank and ALL other Healers are on the Add Tank 
---
And form the first Raid to now it was pretty easy this way.
---
Thanks for your useless "BeTtEr Go To ReTail" post.
---
I ran that place 19 times for my crowd pummeler.
---
R/classicwow: world PvP is out of control! I’m getting camped at flight paths 24/7! There’s nothing I can do! Blizzard has to make some massive changes to the game or else I’m going to quit! 
---
Also r/classicwow: twitch suspended someone for targetting a specific person, following them across azeroth and camping them 24/7. What has this come to!? This sucks! Streamers deserve to get camped!!!
---
How does aggro works on Ragnaros for melee dps? Because he always kill our melees one by one. We do everything correctly with Wrath- melee going out and waiting for tank to get aggro back. I thought that after this it is impossible to get aggro if tank is closer than melee until next wrath, which wipes threat.
---
Playing on Zandalari myself, this has been my expectation which was completely met.
---
People are much nicer, and I still meet a good amount of RP players who I can have witty banter with.
---
Oh, and we pull with a Paladin running in and Bubble.
---
Horde have huge advantage on transportation and the game wasn’t designed so every fp and boat are camped constantly. There’s too many players with nowhere to go
---
If I were alliance on Skeram I'd be saying the exact same things. 80:20 ratios aren't enjoyable for either side.
---
60:40 though, now we're talking, I'd happily pick the minority faction, whichever it its, in that case. Hence rolling an alli on Incendius.
---
Because it's a different game. Classic, despite it's faults is closer to Vanilla than private servers ever were.
---
I transferred in the most recent wave. It's probably 70-30, 65-35 on HS. So about the same % as stalagg but reversed.
---
logging out and then logging back in
---
Low quality content with nearly zero effort should be deleted. Thats what I care about and this is that kind of post.
---
I am loving Phase 2 on a fairly balanced Pvp server.
---
Agree 100%!
---
&gt; This isnt vanilla. Its classic.
---
Okay, let's add LFR and flying mounts and sharding then because "it's not vanilla it's classic"
---
:\^)
---
Its fine to fuck one person instead of fifty
---
I know?
---
there are no alliance dominant pvp servers on EU. there's a lower pop server with a relatively even split though
---
Sounds petty as hell. And this is less about individuals but rather a general attitude permeating the community.
---
I see, but yes I’d clear last boss as well.
---
Also, can you elaborate a bit more on your first post? You said I’d make more if I farmed herbs in DM:E than if I bought them myself? I didn’t quite get it, thanks!
---
I am on a fairly balanced PvP server and people still cry constantly about being outnumbered
---
this but unironically
---
Yessir :D
---
I got ganked about 6 times trying to take the zep from org the other day because there was a group of 10-15 alliance sat on it, once you step on the zeplin you can be killed :)
---
What server? Is there any way to kmow which servers have more of what faction? Incendius seems to be fairly balanced.
---
It happens on my server Amnennar.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure why people keep perpetuating this myth. It's true humans &amp; nelfs have subpar pvp racials (as do trolls, btw), however escape artist and stoneform are amazing.
---
heh, welcome to grob mob. horde or alli? our server is amazing all around. i hate to break it to you though, you're still gonna die a lot, no matter what faction (although horde dominate wpvp slightly more than alli). 
---
like i said, i get leaving a pvp server thats super imbal for another pvp server. good call, grob is great. what i think is ridiculous is someone leaving behind multiple 60s to go to a pve server because they have spirit res PTSD or something.   
---
also, BGs are gonna help much more than you think. 90% of the day in day out pvpers you see, that you are dying to, are doing it for honor. when BGs come out, they will be worth far more honor, and the time spent playing wont be ganking people at TP it will be in AV and WSG. sure you'll have rogues around ganking people, random wpvp encounters of groups of people farming or going to dungeons, but you aren't going to see wpvp as it is right now at all. the only people who will be wpvping are casual people doing it for the fun of wpvp, not honor or anything else. Which i think is a good thing actually.
---
I havent had the guts to try that yet but I bet you can get pretty close. I know you can hit it from the side where nobody is farming HKs!
---
yep, definitely a very short time for such a big ticket item. But people should stop repeating the 'one week' thing as fact.
---
Seething retail baby the post.
---
I think he's saying all their gear is either t1 or t2 (helm/legs).
---
Thanks a bunch for help tipping the scales. I'm focusing on the warlock now. Cheaper mounts will help with general gold economy too
---
Oh I definitely enjoy playing efficiently too.
---
Its the people we stomp with our skilled, geared characters who don't enjoy it.
---
I like rogue and warriors a lot at 60 but not until maybe 40 while leveling up.
---
For rogue, once you get duel wield and some of your oh shit buttons like sprint/vanish/blind things get better.  I started an alt rogue after getting to 40 with my priest, and I think I died more between 5-15 on the rogue than I did 1-40 on the priest.
---
Read my post completly. I already told you that you only get honor if you get the last hit (Final Blow) on them. That almost never happens if its a heated battle because someone always does more dmg to dying people than  a simple corruption tick.  
---
Also you can limit the time to lets say 5 seconds after the player died.   
---
That would be totally enough.
---
Razorgore has a very even split and it’s a large server.
---
i'm sure they do have pvp but nothing like a pvp server. i'm glad you are enjoying the game though, that is all that matters.
---
&gt; 32 Spelldmg and 23 Int are a lot better than 1 Str and 2% crit.
---
Brother no. Think about what you're saying - if 32 SD is better than 2% crit, all of your pieces with 1% crit would be outdone by pieces with 16 SD, which are a dime a dozen. You'd literally be using almost exclusively spell power gear, including Judgment helm/legs, yet there's no SD gear on any BiS list. Why do you imagine that is?
---
Whatever website you're using to calculate upgrades, it looks like it has stat weights completely off, don't trust it. You can go for a spelladin build if you like Judgment and spell power gear, which plays a lot different to AP  ret, but for AP ret, crit is king due to Vengeance.
---
Yes, in the settings under each type of UF there's a checkbox for "predictive heals". You have to enable them by frame type (target, party, raid, raid-40, and assist/MT).
---
Nice, thanks for the info!!!
---
You're complaining about WotF?  Is this 2005?  Perception is Incredibly useful.  I've been caught by so many Human rogues, warriors, mages because they pop that after getting a notification on Spy.  Not sure if you're complaining or not?
---
Okay?
---
Nice! What’s your alliance main on incendius? So I know to look out for you in the world ;)
---
It's a pvp server, by now people should have understand that the main purpose of PVP server is to pvp. Everything else is going to suffer from it. If you don't want to pretty much only pvp, either reroll pve / stop playing / wait for migration to pve server. But complaining to be killed over and over doing on a pvp server is to be expected.
---
I cancel-cast greater heals when I'm MT healing in MC, for the bosses with big hits. Works great for me.
---
Sounds like you are EXTREMELY defensive over the fact that horde massively outnumber alliance on many servers and are camping everywhere they can.
---
But go ahead and keep corpse camping and crying when people leave the server.
---
Love me some Papadosio. Great band!
---
I know people tend to dislike asmongold, but I think he put it pretty well when he said that 
---
"There is nothing really wrong with the actual gameplay community of Classic, but the meta community, the ones that push guides and BiS lists, the streamers and forums, are all horrible and toxic, because they have certain expectations that if not met will always result in negativity."
---
Lvl 59 on Grob; started P2 at 52. Even on a balanced PvP realm, you should expect to spend a ton of time dead. World’s just too small for the number of players in Classic.
---
afaik as long as you don't eat two explosions at once you should be fine, maybe you can eat 2 but not 3.
---
i may be wrong here (not a tank, but we do this strat so i've seen it a bunch) but for healers, instead of getting antsy and just spamming the shit out of you, they might wait a sec or two for you to get shout off? i dont remember if that is a thing or not but if a healer gets aggro the fights AIDS.
---
I suspect these will be more popular in phase 3 when blackwing lair comes out, as people are clearing mc and ony pretty handily
---
How can it be "communication and working together" if you MC a random player to help them to get to a dungeon?
---
Nope, if you don't leave group / don't get kicked you won't get tpd out, even if everyone else leaves.
---
Okay, then ignoring that whole point and focusing only on dots, it would leave a lot of bullshit for anyone that's alive and then goes for that player you were just fighting. If they finish the kill, what honor do they get? They finished it when you wouldn't otherwise (assume that the dots would leave them at 1% for this hypothetical or any amount that guarantees they don't die without help).       
---
What about if they start tagging, and your dot gets the last finishing tick.        
---
At what point is it distinguishing between you being able to count for it, or not (after death)? Because this also ruins a potential current strategy where you wait for the person to die in a 1v1 to yoink full honor, or any XvX fight instead of splitting honor.          
---
I also don't see why it should be changed, if someone beats me out they deserve the honor. No it doesn't matter if I die to them after, as I "won".
---
I feel ya man.. First 3 weeks of rainding for me was in a pug rolling for gear. Lost all my rolls. After joining my guild, there was not a single piece of gear a rogue could roll on for 4 weeks straight. I was farming pots for the tanks, in addition to respecing each week. It was costing me personally around 120g per raid. After 7 weeks of getting no loot, its just not worth that investment. I now show up in pvp build and potions for myself. The burn out gets pretty real.
---
Yes, though I think it's even more than that, it's him wanting an authentic experience. Being a streamer makes your gameplay completely different. Soda cares a lot about this game and is one of the streamers that can afford to take a long break and just play Classic off stream, so he did that very often, but I guess a second account might be a compromise to that.
---
Same on firemaw, heading to BRM is risky with just one raid as there could be a few alliance raids there. Just waitin in Kargath till you have 3/4/5 raids then run as a group lowering the chance of being killed and losing those buffs
---
Even if it works, you'd run into diminishing returns on MC after 3 casts.
---
lol back2retail noob.
---
The evil ones must respect the true evil.
---
It sure is! But like I said, I genuinely do not care enough about the topic to try sway your opinion
---
What motivation could there be to lie about this
---
I'm the 4th ranked Hunter on the server. Check me out on YouTube!

You don't fit in with he other human beings in this world.

lol first post i see " [Who actually likes the Honor system?](https://old.reddit.com/r/HardcoreClassicWoW/comments/e2qs2n/who_actually_likes_the_honor_system/)  "
---
yeah no its just a copy of this sub
---
Then asmon and esfand should be banned, correct?
---
also like that view of the barrens on the horizon

HERE COMES THE ~~PAIN~~ LIGHT, BITCH!
---
10 alliance in the ship to grom goll .. since phase 2 released. tell me stories ..
---
Showing interest is a good thing!
---
&gt; What’s the expected normal amount for a dungeon group or something? 
---
There is no expected amount for RP. In fact unless i am in a group with other people who RP i personally assume that the others do not RP and we just play the dungeon normally.
---
&gt; Would expressing a certain chosen personality be acceptable? 
---
Really depends on the personality and how well you can RP it. In general plain nice characters are usually welcomed into a group and easy to RP. It gets harder when you want to RP a thug who is a total ass. It's easy falling into overpowering RP. For example "Oh yeah, you weapon? I stole that earlier. You didn't even notice!" would be something i would not accept as a fact because of how sudden it is. If some setup time went into it and it was actually RPed out, sure. It happens. Just "one-upping" is rather frowned upon.
---
If you have any questions feel free to send me a PM aswell. Happy to help you out! :)
---
It's not griefing, it's the game
---
Yeh that's how it started, then it went to personal loot because it still wasn't "enough" for the people crying about loot.
---
And yet that wasn't enough, so it went further to personal loot.
---
Lots of responses, I haven't read them so its possible this is covered before, if so i'm sorry.
---
Warrior is a very nuanced class which has surprising depths to it if you decide to go looking. Your knowledge of this greatly impacts how well you do as a warrior. I'll point to some things below
---
Stats: This may seem intuitive at first "I'm a tank, I want stamina and defense to take less damage obviously" but this isn't necessarily the case. Defense is extremely valuable from a damage mitigation standpoint, every point gives you 0.1 dodge/parry/block/less chance to be hit and crit, meaning 10 defense is 3% hard avoidance 1% soft. Defense is also made a lot less valuable due to shield block, will cover below.  However this does nothing for threat generation, which is arguably as important or more so as surviving. For this Weapon skill is king followed closely by hit. Getting 3% "free" hit and getting through the hardcoded 1% miss chance by having a weapon skill difference of 10 or less between you and bosses (meaning 305 weapon skill) is mental. That means you only need 2% hit from items to be hit capped in 5 mans, and 6% for raids. The reduction in glancing blow damage is fantastic as well, less so for 1 hand and shield due to heroic strike, but especially as a DW tank. You generally want the bare minimum regarding survivability and then go balls to the wall with threat increases.
---
Heroic Strike: The nr. 1 noobtrap, it is by far the most expensive warrior ability and least threat efficient option you have (outside certain situations like being rage-capped, Vael you literally are rage capped for instance.) reason is it costs 15 rage base, turns your next auto into a special so you do not generate rage either, and gives a bit of extra damage and an additional threat mod to your attack. In reality you're spending 15-40 rage for an additional 500 or so threat. For reference sunder armour produces 950 at 15 rage and instant cast without the 8 piece might sets.
---
HOWEVER so long as you have enough rage to use a threat generating ability every GCD, go ham on HS, sitting at 100 rage is a cardinal sin, you want to float in the 50-90 range.
---
Additionally there's the DW tanking /stopcasting macro, this makes heroic strike your absolute most valuable ability but it requires a weapon swing timer and being on your toes. What you do is you use a quick offhand and a slow main hand and queue up heroic strikes for your next hit. While your main hand has HS charged up your off hand, despite being white attacks, use the special hit table (so 6% hit chance for hit cap) still generates rage and such and is susceptible to glancings (again making weapon skill king) then before your MH attack finishes you hit your /stopcasting macro (NOT /stopattack as this will cancel auto attacking) and let your MH weapon go through as a white hit, your rage generation and threat alike will skyrocket using this but it's a little tricky if you're inexperienced.
---
Shield Block: Hello, most OP ability in the game. This ability alone is why defense isn't the be all end all and why tanks don't chase the "crit def cap" like madmen as they do in later expansions. When an attack is rolled the game goes through a table to see what happens (miss,dodge,parry,block then glancing,crit,hit) this means that with SB giving 100% block for 2 attacks (with 1/5 imp shield block) you're entirely crit immune regardless of defense skill so long as you're not attacked more than twice in a 5 second window. Ragnaros for instance you can be crit immune with 300 defense because of this, barring some ungodly parry haste shenanigans.
---
Spec: Most people believe deep prot to be the way to go as a solid tank, whilst the protection tree is quite front-loaded. I main tank as 0/32/19 (Fury tank). With this I get almost everything I want from the prot tree, Defiance, Last Stand, imp shield block and toughness. I lose out on tactical mastery to make stance dancing less painful, true and shield slam. However flurry, enrage and bloodthirst more than makes up for it, and playing without tac mastery can be done once you're used to it.
---
It also comes down to clicking off PW:S to not limit rage flow, using bloodrage for double rage on damage taken, using blood rage/ battle shout at a LoS pull to get a bit of initial aggro. Not constantly swap into battle for thunder clap and other useless shit (Def stance has a 145% threat mod with defiance, whilst battle/zerker stance have a 90%, the threat difference between stances is monumental)
---
Also, if t's not a big mob with lots of hp, just ignore skull threat building and toss a taunt on it if it goes running, between rogue stuns and general nukes that one shouldn't be a problem at all, focus on the other 3 mobs in the pack so you're good and ready when dps swap over.
---
That isn't all, but its some things to keep in mind, should anyone have further questions feel free to comment.
---
I played in vanilla and had about 100 days played on my rogue at 60 by the time BC rolled around. Here's some RNG I experienced:
---
1. It took me close to a year of running UBRS 2-3 times a day to see my Shadowcraft Chest drop.
---
2. I saw one Perditions drop, ever. (I won it woo!)
---
3. I never saw Core Hound Tooth drop.
---
4. I have still to this day never seen Onyxia drop a weapon of any form.
---
5. I didn't get my T2 chest piece until I finally had it drop while farming BWL in Wrath.
---
6. In classic rather than vanilla.. I recently got my Hand of Justice after soloing Angerforge 76 times. Rogue in my group ran BRD three times and saw it drop on all of them, he won it on the second drop.
---
That's just me. I know people who never saw a single binding, others who had both in one week. I know raids that had the leaf drop every week and others who never saw anything but the eye. So to answer your question.. it's not just unlikely, its happened to *many* people already and it'll happen again in classic.
---
Don't play this game expecting to get your loot eventually just because you want it. If you're not having fun with friends and guildies, with loot being a bonus? You aren't going to enjoy yourself.
---
If you dont want to make your own content in classic and play for fun you will be dissapointed. This version of wow is not just about the loot cycle.
---
It stores data on your PC so it'll apply to all your characters. Also, see if you have a quick scan option, it's like a tiny fast forward looking button at the top of the window.
---
bobby b was god's gift to that show
---
Yeah well it's just amazing to me that everyone KNEW for a fucking fact this is EXACTLY what was going to happen and you all still picked PvP servers anyways. I fucking hate what a non-stop bitch fest WoW players are.
---
Grom’Gol base is a better option for horde, no? It’s very close to booty bay, but it has instant (almost) zeppelin to Orgrimmar.
---
Then esfand and asmon should both be banned. Am I wrong? They both accused advertise of stream sniping and had people attack him.
---
Why is it that when I shift-click a name in the chat, sometimes the /who comes up in the chat window (how I'd like it to always show up), and sometimes opens a new window showing the /who results? 
---
Does it have anything to do with the Census Plus addon?
---
&gt;but some people are so insanely obsessed with hating Retail
---
What's even worse is that they most of the time have absolutely no idea why they hate it, as in they have no idea how retail actually is.
---
They look at LFR and think how easy and free gear retail is. They think that because you don't have to spam chat like an idiot for half an hour to find group/people there is no sociliazing... 
---
I can completely understand when someone doesn't like something even if I like it myself IF they have proper, meaningful and preferably based on their own experience reasons to not like it. But what some nostalgic neophobes can conjure up sometimes is bordering with fanatism...
---
at least 5
---
I think you are being too hyperbolic.
---
we have EPGP system which is fine. still if no weapons drop you can´t use your points
---
18 naked hunters in the showers at TRAM RANCH
---
Nice yea I’m 60 arms, I stance dance all day especially since I’m really into pvp. Was just missing that dmg opener
---
Can you link those stats?
---
you should uninstall kid and go back to something more you're speed like roblox
---
This is why I tell people that while hoarding DKP can pay off... odds are the people picking up every other item you won't bid on often end up *way* better geared.
---
But this is like buying a Ford GT and there is no such thing as insurance. Then you have your car and insurance becomes a thing. You never signed up for it, you couldn't have educated yourself that this thing would happen in the future. This isn't PvP lmao, PvP is fun, this is griefing and corpse camping, it's a PvP server not a griefing server
---
&gt; or the entire idea of them loses its meaning.
---
So like, they dont work if you mouseclick them?
---
Yeah, noted. I ended up running Scholomance last night and had a blast (hilariously easy to find a group too), and my gear was just fine for tanking. Ended up wiping twice to aggroing too much at once (those rooms are packed, damn), but everyone was understanding and we did just fine after.
---
In July, so on the beta. Was that the level 45 tournament? Because if so that doesn't reflect class balance at 60.
---
Shamans look for different stats, and will often compete with healers.
---
Enhancement shamans may compete with you, but they're a rare breed considering how low their raid DPS is and the fact that Nightfall isn't in the game yet.
---
Your competition is quite low.
---
Oh super interesting, thanks! Will have to try this
---
Imagine having to titan roll in mc, for a sec. 
---
Yeh, I can guarantee you loot scarcity and "problem" op describes, are some of the major reasons for having personal loot now.
---
Wisdom
---
Well I'm no expert as I've only healed this fight so take my word with a grain of salt, but:
---
The tank being closer than melee? I'm a bit confused. Melee can still of course steal aggro if they generate more threat than the tank. Keep also in mind that only the targets that get hit get their threat cleared (correct me if I'm wrong, anyone) which means that melee who move out correctly will not have their threat cleared, but the tank will. This is readily fixed by a taunt, which puts the tank at the same threat level as the highest person on the list. This will still however mean that a lot of the melee will be relatively close to stealing aggro again, especially early in the fight when the 10% extra threat needed to steal aggro isn't a lot.
---
I know that feeling bro, think I'm at 10 MC clears and 13 Onyxia kills now, and I've seen a total of ONE weapon that I would want, one deathbringer. Meanwhile I've yet to see a single OEB, BRE or Spinal, not even a single onslaught girdle...
---
Because people like to get easy rewards, change my mind, but with the amount of reserved runs and 40man raid grps to camp instances/fps, they just want easy rewards.
---
i just logon for raids - but even my raid dies in front of blackrock because there's 3 horde raids "securing" it.
---
Agreed but if you have a prot just put him on it. Fury prot is better served tanking garr.
---
This is something that I suspect is very server dependant. As someone that transferred from a large launch day server to a smaller server, I saw a remarkable difference in the general attitude of people on the server.
---
Uhm, yes it is.
---
Could not agree more
---
Not nearly as much. Not as many clusters of civilians would be my guess.
---
People hate retail because it is different and it "defiled" their holy World of Warcraft. And then they realize that it was the community that slowly pushed Blizzard towards what Retail has become. So everyone who is bad or doesnt agree perfectly with what Classic is should go to retail, because thats where bad people apparently go.
---
So I have been 7/8 tier 1 for about 8 weeks now, but intend on using 8/8 when the pants finally drop. We do have one Shaman with 8/8 so I thought I would link the logs from our last MC clear. Cerr is the Shaman with 8/8 and Healing Wave spamming:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/2HGFVwrMRgdQPDBa/#boss=-3&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2&amp;type=healing
---
Theoretically 8/8 has higher potential output and is more mana efficient but there is higher chance of overhealing. Also something interesting is 8/8 becomes better when multiple Shaman are using it and helping keep more Healing Way stacks on the raid.
---
Don't think titans will be an easy sell currently. Supreme power sells because some people like to pad meters, but extra health is completely unnecessary for any content.
---
Which will be close to nothing because they are 5 on him
---
My 2 cents leveled 2 priests, one as shadow and one as holy. Holy spec with smite talents is far superior to shadow while leveling.
---
A lot of people will say, go holy/disc until 40, theb respec. Rrason being that shadow doesn't offer much dmg early on.
---
I ho estly felt that holy-smite spec woth spiritual guidance and spirit tap was the superior leveling spec, even post 40. My reasonings being.. 
---
1. You don't have to switch in and out of sform to heal or cure disease.
---
2. Your single target dmg is rly high granted u got the more important pieces from SM, and ur gonna have a lot of spirit  gear while leveling.
---
3. Healing in dungeons becomes ecen easier, and finding groups even more so.
---
4. You get to play a spec you can't play later (smite priest)
---
Now the main issue with leveling as holy is... you suck in solo pvp.
---
Thats bullshit hyperbole.
---
I agree that having easy to reach keys for key abilities like interrupt and such and vital, but that mouseclicking one ability that is not reactive makes it "a hell lot less effective" is pure elitist hyperbole.
---
What, how?!
---
I'm also a hunter. Exact same thing happens here.
---
We grind the several groups that coming running until the horde zerg comes along, then it is every man for himself until they move along.
---
1 Binding, 1 Eye, no ingots yet.
---
I want to leave the World of Warcraft better than I found it
---
I do have a value about killing gnomes in real life
---
New guilds first attempts without much Mc gear or full pbis I can see this happening. Our first ony kill had 10 up out of 35.
---
Nope, the people trying to do something other than pvp will still be ganked, because the bigger faction will be stuck in queues for BG.
---
Personally I very much recommend MMO mices, those with 12 buttons on the side. They make keybinds so so so much easier. It does take a bit to get used to however, and it's not for everyone, so I can't say for certain you will like it. Razor scimitar, razer naga, logitech g600 I've had good experience with all of them, though I pref the scimitar.
---
Other than that, honestly mouse is all about feel. There's no good or bad, just what fits for you well, so getting the option to feel the mouse in your hands is a big bonus.
---
Implement a decay system. Our guild has 20% decay per week, so those who hoard their DKP get punished the most. Obviously the person with the most DKP and doesn't spend it will stay at the top, but they lose way more than the guy who is taking scraps.
---
Yeah it's a part of the game, sometimes stuff just never drops.
---
Back in Wrath I cleared heroic Icecrown and I've never seen Dislodged Foreign Object (BIS caster trinket) drop in 22 weeks. Yes, I counted. It wasn't even something super rare, probably around 20% drop rate.
---
It's way worse in Vanilla/Classic. There are more people in a raid, many items have low drop rates and there are pieces that several classes want. I think expecting full BIS is unrealistic unless you've got some shady loot council hookups and even then RNG can not pan out for you.
---
IMO "Farm herbs to go raid to get gear" is a bad mindset. Go raid if you enjoy progression (kinda absent right now since the only raids available are piss easy) or just enjoy hanging out with your guild. If you don't like those things, level an alt or play another game until new raids come out.
---
lol that's not a horde boat, both of those towns are neutral you dingus
---
I just had priests and warriors fear the last 2 mobs then pop aspect of pack and get them the king buff. Druid and rogue just stealth. Mages root and blink.
---
I don’t want to waste 2 invis pots getting them there.
---
I don't think they were heavily outnumbered in the first place but if anything, they definitely made it way worse. 
---
It's not victim blaming since alliance who transferred out aren't victims at all: they are dominating on their own servers, ganking horde here and there.
---
Based on my experience, blizzard very rarely put community in a cage by forceful limitations. The census shows the general faction balance being 52 to 48 in Alliance favor though.
---
Crusader, spell power, basically any best in slot enchantment and then some niche ones like movement speed to boots.
---
Hunter here, took me 17 runs for carapace.. so it will drop for you eventually.. then lose it to another partymember.
---
No he doesn't even play on zt anymore
---
If they are in a group it wil be close to 50 honor each wich on horde populated servers isnt bad
---
It's a which bug that was also in vanilla. I believe it has something to do when there's people with a very similar name.
---
fear?  just roll the brainless UD race
---
about 5-10x as many people as they had per server in vanilla.
---
(I know dude I'm just trying to provide validation so there's less whining on this sub)
---
There are means to put a personality into a character. I am not that good at doing it yet, but I have met people that might have achieved that.
---
CC is god in PvP, at least from a 'how it feels' due to the powerlessness involved. Orcs are resistant to one of the more debilitating and common CC effects. Forsaken can tell CC to fuck right off with their racial. Tauren have an AoE CC.
---
If the taunt doesn't resist, offtank should now be first on threat? Not sure how your melee is dying there.
---
Isn’t this data super old?
---
Can I have a look on your data source?
---
Heal power, +4 on chest
---
Unoriginal 1/10
---
most content takes place around ironforge.  And theoretically the theramore menthil harbor should be a safer route since it's entirely alliance controlled
---
My guild has somehow gotten 2 eyes and a left binding. Our luck has been insane.
---
It depends on the entire composition. You need a certain amount of crit for a hybrid build, which can be reached without lionheart, especially as you waste hit % by using lionheart.
---
You also completely discount the 23 Int on T2. 23 Int is ~400 Mana and nearly 0.5% spellcrit. Spellcrit helps with HoW and shadow oil. 400 Mana is 75% of another max rank consecration, so basically ~400 extra dmg every boss fight, when a fight lasts on average 1 minute, that's ~6 dps just from the int. Not to mention 18 stam, which helps your survivability as an additional minor benefit.
---
Also you can't look at this in a vacuum. Pieces with 16 spelldmg aren't a dime a dozen and pieces with exclusively 1% crit are neither. There are few pieces where this comparison even makes sense, e.g. shoulders where earthslag is 1 Str, 8 Int and 9 Spelldmg vs Flamescarreds 12 Agi, whre I think the Spelldmg option is better. Whereas for rings painweavers 16 AP and 1% crit beat Maiden's Circle/Songstones 18 Spelldmg.
---
Most bis lists are crap, simple as that, ret paladin is a very unknown spec and the people who make guides for the most well known sites (wowhead, icyveins) have no clue about the spec and just assume to copy fury warriors. The wowhead classic retribution guide is the worst guide I've ever seen.
---
Spelldmg is an extremly powerful stat for any ret paladin, no matter whether you use SoC AP/SP hybrid or go Spelladin. For SoC users, 1 Spelldmg is around as good as 0.8 Str. So, if you like that better, you can say T2 helm has 43 Str. And how do you feel 25 Str compares to 2% crit?
---
I love this class of videos, makes me feel better for choosing a RP PVP server without unbalanced factions, overpopulated and hey, i even get fun RP events every weekend.
---
The guards are on all of the towers, not just UC.
---
got my 1st binding last week, here is months and months of grinding ahead not getting the 2nd...
---
Exactly.. still getting downvoted for some reason.
---
i thing u r right at almost all u said, just one thing. LFG.... i dont thing that lfg tool was bad, teleport to instance did. lfg in classic is not effort, its just copy and paste few hours into lfg channel or PMs to ppl u find with /who. theres no social bonding, no social skills r beeing used no real work behind. all the player to player interaction u do is asking for their spec.
---
Crusader is the big moneymaker.
---
Other farmable enchants are +7 int or +9 strength on bracer.
---
You should look into buying +5 dmg on 1hand wpn, +5 all resist on cloak, and mount speed on gloves.
---
There are other enchants that people are interested in, but they are either from trainers, vendors or usually cheap on AH.
---
It just seems to attract a younger audience. People in their 30's are less inclined to roleplay apparently, but I don't have much evidence other than my experiences.
---
Perhaps maybe a different server?  If you are calling 1 hr corpse runs to brd a lie you are the insane one.
---
But it's totally fine for partnered streamers to harras smaller non partnered streamers. Got it.
---
I was just thinking about this, how could op say something, the other player reply and then op press alt+z and then print screen fast enough? There's just no way, or at least very unlikely.
---
Bro i don’t want to believe this is a real story. I would be so damn salty...
---
From what I understand it usually works fine if melees stand out on knockback and don't go back in before the MT is back in positon(giving a second or two to make sure).
---
4+ times the size
---
You can easily fill the role of 3rd/4th OT in MC with that gear.
---
Or just call it VC like the community of yore did
---
The more raids that come out the more gear that will spread.
---
People can be pretty dumb. You get a lot of hurrrr durrrr WotF and orc stun resist but that’s basically it lol. The racials are fairly even and situational. Having played horde in vanilla and alliance in classic, I lean toward Alliance having a slight advantage.
---
PvP realms will have world pvp, and the next 2 weeks will have an increased amount of it, but if you want to 100% decide for your self when to pvp, you need to pick a PvE realm where you can toggle it and join battlegrounds.
---
Most people knew this would happen in P2 with HK and no battlergrounds to farm it in.
---
Yes, both TBC and WotLK had a lot of quality-of-life changes that really needed in Classic.  
---
Unfortunately we have loud #nochange minority that would try to block this)
---
I find this to be the truth regarding main stream gaming culture in general. Heavily influenced by twitch. Created for and by immature 16 year olds that get no attention elsewhere and like to trigger over the Internet.
---
If anyone's curious: on a human, it's -2 dps behind Thrash Blade.
---
some ingots, 1 eye and 3 bindings.
---
even enough for 1 TF :P
---
0 mage blades ....
---
Thats the Twitch Retail playerbase for ya. 
---
Based Asmongold ruining classic, hes such a hero /s
---
No, that's nonsense. Computers don't need to cut it out in order to store it, it's copied.
---
I think they were supposed to drop the chat lines by the person you're reporting, but that was too hard and they settled for just deleting the last X lines instead. Which is so annoying that I've actually refrained from reporting some gold sellers because it would drop my chat history during some conversations.
---
I bounce between this and that so often.
---
Because caring about other people has been treated as a negative trait by certain segments of the population and that has only been exacerbated since end of 2016.
---
All that is happening right now was predicted back when Classic launched.. Why are you all surprised? Why didn't you switched to a balanced server or straight up PVE?
---
Blizz won't fix it.
---
&gt;  I have been an orc fan since 1999 when I played Warcraft 2 battle.net edition and I am proud being on the horde. 
---
lol
---
&gt; am only level 50 and I bet I died 15+ times when trying to quest in the hinderlands last evening due to 60 alliance ganking lowbies. 
---
lmao hinderlands
---
&gt; A few times we actually killed a few 60s with lowbie teamwork. 
---
&gt;Quitting is only making balance for your faction even worse so you are the fucking asshat in the end.
---
lol ???
---
Deadmines is DM south
---
Tell that to the Blackrock Mountain Mafia the Horde have on Grobbulus please. It's always a 30+ minute corpse walk from Thorium Point to BRD.
---
\+ vote for Goldeneye reference
---
Bad bot
---
The problem is the incentive to farm more honor that other PVPer on your faction, it's more about the system that don't fit the current min max mentality for me.
---
But there is no denying that unbalanced population is real and the major factor for this mess, which is on blizzard fault.
---
Haha they ain’t gonna like this one chief....but I agree. 
---
Lok’tar Ogar fiend.
---
Looks like rag came back from submerge, pally dies, Hunter kills rag while he himself is at 15% hp.
---
reeeeeeetail
---
Reporting names is a inefficient way to deal with the consequence instead of eliminating the cause. In my opinion, for RP realms Blizzard should have implemented a racial specific random name generator. It would have helped to get rid of reporting and also could have served as a gatekeeper for RP community.
---
Shouldn't trust your eye if 30fps looks fine to you. That would be a wasted effort.
---
Thanks! I've used  [https://www.wowdownrank.com/#](https://www.wowdownrank.com/#)  and it matches what you said!
---
Hello, trying to farm some arcanitr crystals myself. I was wondering, is it worth to go and farm them with mining or invest the same time to farm lashers (holy/prot paladin) in DM E and buy them?
---
He has a fucking job and can afford it you NEET, your goodboy mommy points cant afford this luxury life
---
Nop, the data is pretty fresh^^
---
My server as exemple, until 2 weaks ago we had 39/61 A/H, today is 40/60.
---
That's the one that uses wcl stats, right?
---
Oh, you meant faction change: sorry, got me confused. This service wasn't introduced in Vanilla at all iirc, so I am not sure if Blizz will ever allow it in Classic.
---
If I have 8k now, in t1 gear and were talking about me in AQ gear im about 12k... the amount of poor reading comp on this sub.
---
It’s the most accurate thing we have. 
---
Btw If they arnt using logs they probably don’t play enough to be worth counting anyway.
---
Just to defend his self interest like most people that support this narrative.
---
I feel you have to have a goal besides bis in mind,  such as developing companionship, or a desire to advance the raid. If loot is your primary goal, you will most likely be disappointed.
---
Over a week? Oof. All I did was DM Tribute runs for a day and I could afford to buy it outright, seems like an easier plan.
---
&lt;3 thanks, I hate you :P. jk, I'll keep at it!
---
hey guys it's tadzio here with a 15 minute video that you really should be watching through NordVPN
---
j/k
---
Haven't seen any so far
---
Hm, sounds strange. Can I have a look at the source of your data then?
---
Idiot.
---
Except Rule 1 on Reddit supersedes the sub reddit.  However the job is done
---
I don't want the concessions but I could do with balanced servers. At this point it's about being able to level at one's own pace (you shouldn't be punished for taking leveling slowly, or god forbid trying to get across to Kalimdor on an alt).
---
Not really Ranking system works comparatively, each faction will get to the higher ranks at the same time. 
---
But the frustration of long queue times will be real
---
i agree, it depends on what matchup you want to target with your race choice.
---
Has anyone tried simming Goldminer helm with +7 axes instead of Edgemasters gloves, for human i mean.
---
All the pvp edgelords rolled Horde to have a numbers advantage and are actively destroying their own servers. Wow, I'm totally shocked that happened.
---
Because MC was added last minute.  There is some dev video where they say it was created in a week.  They realized they had no end game and whipped it up real fast.
---
I can't not hear the music with that photo
---
Would love to see your supporting evidence on this.
---
The green shadow wrath gear is BIS in pve for a lot of slows. Bracers, cloak from the top of my head.
---
Deadmines is one word. Clearly the abbreviation for it must be "the d".
---
No we were absolutely heavily outnumbered. It was evident by anyone who actually played on a PvP server as alliance. Before honor every questing zone had far more horde than alliance and now it’s astounding how much more there are. There really isn’t a place alliance can go on servers like Herod that you aren’t going to get camped. If I want to do anything in BRM or DM I can expect nearly 10 corpse runs before I get to the dungeon. 
---
Blizz has never done much of anything (if anything) to answer to faction imbalance but I’d be very stressed to find a situation that has become as bad as it is now. The way the dominant faction has handled the imbalance has led to camping virtually everywhere. I can’t really go into the open world to get any mats for raids without being zerged by a bunch of horde. I don’t get any chance at real PvP because they are roaming around in groups of 5 or more. This is due in part because there are so many horde here they have to go everywhere to get their chance at some honor but the reality is this has caused a lot of alliance players to stop logging in entirely or they simply sit in a major city (where you can also get killed) and do nothing. 
---
And I don’t think anyone assumes or even wants ganking to stop entirely - it’s part of the game in a sense. But on servers like Herod, horde controls everything. There isn’t a push/pull in who owns the area it’s always horde. It’s not a competition at all. They won. To me that’s not much fun. I go into most areas knowing I’m going to get killed and be able to do nothing about it. Horde don’t experience any of the same things because now they have the game on easy mode. 
---
Normally I’d say let things run it’s course but without Blizz doing something the dominant faction has literally no incentive to change their play style. What will result is the smaller faction will stick to BGs only and world PvP will die. 
---
And side note, the census was not a good indication of reality at all in my opinion.
---
Inb4 someone shits on you for being slow. Grats man.
---
What’s the primary benefit of this strat? How much time would it save vs a kill 3 adds - kill garr - kill rest of ads strat?
---
Right ok
---
No offense, but ignorance doesnt also excuse bad design suggestions.
---
It would have taken less than 5 minutes to figure out the difference between PVE and PVP servers.
---
You kill the goblin boss, rotgrip and princess then vendor the drops. Also herb ghost shrooms and blindweed, about 50g an hour.
---
Me as a noob: "LFG TA" *5 hours later* "ohhhh people call it Sunken Temple"
---
We are on 7 perdition blades in total, 4 mage blades in a row, 6 in total. 5 Staff of Dominance. 7 leafs and 6 benedictions.  
---
0 2h weapons  
---
0 vish kags  
---
0 deathbringers  
---
0 bindings  
---
The distribution is so wonky.
---
Because it makes literally 0 sense to leave them out?
---
You are a VERY small portion of the population then, and not worth counting.
---
Oh yeah, what a REAL issue
---
step 1. hit 60
---
step 2. get pre raid bis, join a good loot council guild
---
step 3. show up with enchants and consumes, perform well, don't wipe the raid
---
step 4. get gear. if no gear acquired (not due to RNG)
---
step 5. do better
---
sadly there isn't anything you can do about RNG drops but your best chance at getting gear is just being a top performer. not easy at all as a dps warrior seeing as your pre-raid bis is a PITA to get all around just about and theres about a billion other dps warriors foaming at the mouth for the same shit you are. You just gotta stand out from the crowd. Or you could join a DKP guild and hoard your points for a deathbringer or BRE or something, i dunno about that though. just how the game is. the longer the game goes the easier it will be to get gear, guilds will be farming MC/ony forever. When you are clearing MC/Ony, BWL, ZG AQ 20 multiple times, AQ40 all in one week gearing up is going to be easy.  Shit, by the time ZG comes out it will be easy. ZG reset is what, 3 days or something? And less and less people will need gear from MC/ony at that point.
---
I don't get the "tbc without flying" crowd, half of otlands is made with flying in mind.
---
I have 4 alch alts but not nearly enough gold to keep up with my demand for arc crystals and I’d rather pcp than do jump runs. Trying to keep my transmutes on the same schedule is a real pain.
---
Just trying to block out the standard insult. Mission failed.
---
Wrong sub buddy!
---
Dwarf shadow priest is scary af, the racials are not what is winning them fights. Yes it makes it easier, but inner fire + shadow form + priest bubble is tanky af, not to mention all the other things happening.
---
The nice thing is it does go back and forth in Grob. You're not a lone alliance getting ganked every 2 feet.
---
Having friends to play with. It'll always be the most important part of wow for me.
---
Loved Perfect Dark. You could have bots in multiplayer, so I could play alone, or we could team up against them when my brother/friends didn't want to have to play against me.
---
Trolls in Tracksuits (Zandalari Tribe, EU Horde) got their first Ragnaros kill yesterday evening! Was a great night, figured i'd share it with you folk :)
---
Pretty sure he meant 2h warriors, not warriors in general. We are talking about hand of rag here.
---
&gt; "Well too bad, try not to get feared next time"
---
"Also, BFA is 50% off right now, you should buy that instead!"
---
We forgot to ask an undead rogue’s opinion lol
---
Yes, that is PVP
---
yeah, you gotta be right on top of em though. very useful to check around for the rogue while still dead if you just died to one, or if you've seen one around that saw you die.
---
Dude you are describing perfectly what a pve servers are all about.  PvP when you want.  What disconnect do you all these moaning babies not get.
---
SUCH ELITE
---
I always find it hilarious how people respond to videos with "OMG THAT GUY WAS SO BAD."
---
That rogue didn't know he was on TV. He's just playing around... it's not like every encounter you play is always the most optimal in every single way.
---
Interesting - 2nd hand information for me, so thank you for that.
---
Do you know if it works the same for healing?
---
Again, I was always told that healing threat is Heal amount divided by 2.. and the threat is the same no matter how many mobs in combat.. it simply is added to each ones' threat table.
---
If this happens just take Rez sickness, problem solved.
---
I guess some people will jump on tbe retail band wagon. For me personally, im enjoying classic alot more but I quit retail after doing heroic ghuun. Alot of the stuff in retail just felt so boring and I didnt enjoy the never ending treadmill because of titanforging etc.
---
It could also be I found a group of people I really enjoy playing with, but for now I would say classic is better then retail.
---
As a healer I wish I got honor after death. I would go I to a 5v5 with my group and I’m always first target but then my geoup is a able to clean them up yeilding me only 1-2 of the kills
---
Thunderfury is a lot of effort
---
post approved
---
I'm horde and have yet to see a zeppelin without 10/15 ally inside. the big advantage is that we can be out of pvp between undercity and orgrimmar, while it's not possible with boats
---
3Head tier response. 
---
im horde on a high pop pvp server thats fairly balanced and its no better for us. im only level 50 and questing is almost impossible, ive tried every zone and both factions just run around in massive deathballs killing people on the roads, and 60s farm honor on lone 50s right outside mojache etc. 
---
im not trying to say that alliance doesnt have it bad because it its like this for me i know its like this for them too but the whole “its only horde that ganks lowbies” thing is so stupid.
---
Yes, me.  
---
Gaming addiction escapism is no joke
---
Everyone is so Honor hungry that you can just wait as a ghost until you see another player in your faction approach and this player will instantly get them all to dismount and focus. That's when you Res and mount and continue on. With this method (and an invis pot if their group is better organized) I die once as Ally to DM or BRD, sometimes two to BRD because I can't mount, but I like to have my nifty stopwatch for BRD.
---
Thanks man! We took a little while to get regular raids going because we raid late at night (22:00-01:00 server time). A lot of the guild members have RL commitments that mean they can't raid at "normal" times. :)
---
Laugh all you want but the Horde is victorious.  Making alliance quit left and right. 
---
Warms my heart.  ❤️
---
We have a mage that decided not to spend any DKP on anything until Mageblade dropped to be first in line to get it.
---
Our first clear was second week, it still hasn't dropped to this day.
---
Oh and we have 10% DKP decay to prevent hoarding.
---
I can't say for sure that they won't group pve &amp; pvp servers together for BG queues, but I will say that they did do that in Vanilla.  I played on Medivh (pve) and we were grouped with at least two pvp servers.
---
If it's 2 nodes per 3 and 1 node per 15 the vein math is the same. However, herbs you'd get more of too so factor that in.
---
You mentioned ease of stress - gp/h max shouldn't matter as much if you both just want to discord n chill etc
---
I mean you don't even have to be rich to validate spending that much a month on WoW. Assuming WoW is more or less what you do for "entertainment", $165/mo is pretty little compared to most. Dinner and drinks for one night is $20+ per person, movies are what $15 per person now, all sorts of random shit people do for fun in a month adds up. Unless they're a frugal homebody, then yeah sure $165/mo is pretty crazy. But for your average normie its nothing.
---
Nah. Not even remotely. Starting with 1.12 items and talents is making everyone overpowered.
---
I mean tbf you are a warlock.
---
your t1 is worste than greens from the auction house ;D
---
Then you need to make an intellectual effort because this is not what I'm saying.
---
Deadmines is DM: W for Deadmines: Westfall
---
I'm judging the rogue less than I am the priest, he was only a 52 and until the hunter attacked him he didn't seem to do anything, even after dismounting. It looked a little bit like he was going "Maybe I should just watch until I know how this is going"
---
The priest, however, ran directly into traps over and over again for basically no reason.
---
Are you legit asking if it’s better to have double the nodes in double the time?
---
The auctioneer addon gives you an indication of what it has seen in the past. But you have to be aware that it gives you the price of listings, not of sales. So if people way overprice an item you can't see the difference.
---
Do you really think Horde doesn't have any quests like that? Talk about moving the goalpost
---
It sound cool and all but on my server stalagg , horde would have a perma 4-5 hours q they cant do that .
---
:(((
---
If it were actually a war IF would be horde controlled by now.
---
7 weeks of clears for us, zero mageblades.  3 Blastershot launchers, 1 staff of dominance, and 3 weeks where he dropped something other than a weapon (though one of those was our only ToEP, so yay, I guess).
---
Rearward is lit. I want it. Darm paladins
---
Run 25 man ony or less and 25 man MC distribute loot faster that’s what our guild does instead of 40mans our 25 man MC can still kill rag with no submerge now that everyone is pretty geared.
---
Tldr past the first 3 paragraphs. Tldr this exists in everygame it isnt worse here trust me. The mage is an idiot, the necropile set is bis caster pvp if you dont have access to tier and is still decent for other shit. Yes its not pre bis or insane but if your gear is shit then who cares. You have to ignore abnoxious players, thats all you can do.
---
I think so? Not sure if i have any real proof for that tho but that would be my intuition.
---
Imo the majority of gold comes from the arcane crystals over say 100 runs Thats 2-300 nodes. I think faster runs with more access to nodes is better. 
---
I haven’t done any maths on this tho
---
suck it up :)
---
Oof, sorry about your brain
---
Oh my queue is gonna be poppin
---
What u don’t call ubrs GENDRAK?
---
Yeah percentages made me think I double the percentage then that equates to something different. I thought it was just too simplistic to simply say double nodes in double time = same amount of time
---
The latency explains it.  He's already dead.  His computer just hasn't caught up yet
---
it's faster too - you can cut straight across the roof on the way out towards the instance portal.
---
&gt;We're in our 30+ now, fuck spending multiple nights a week raiding when it can be done in one.
---
Couldn't agree more, and I totally buy into the min/max, but not until it's needed. Right now raids going down in 1 night ezpz.
---
tbf RP is usually solely in cities. Nowadays RP is a starting to die off on WrA.
---
Why would you choose the weaker faction on a pvp server lmao
---
Idk, i want to try something else, always played mage and rogue :D
---
Only bragging points! The crafted ones aren't soul bound so feel free to sell them when you're done using them. The quest reward ones are soul bound so I hang on to those until I have full upgrades available (bag and bank slots).
---
"I rolled into a PvP server and more people chose the other faction. I'm mad at the other faction for PvPing and it's Blizzard's fault that more people chose horde on my server and I didn't."
---
&gt;Also, I know Feedback doesn't stack shadow weaving, but does it proc blackout?
---
I believe it can, yes.
---
Everything is on farm since week 1. Please explain how logs will help.
---
I don’t think it’s a bug, more of a way to avoid spamming your chat log when there’s a ton of similar names
---
I really love how that one elite Wetlands prerequisite quest is a lot harder than the followup Stockades quest
---
I checked, I was sure it was as you said, but it's really "*after killing a target that yields experience". I don't know what to think anymore.*
---
Kargath is better for DM because you get a port to TB, which is closer than Org.
---
I was not replying to your response specifically. I was replying to someone asking why you shouldn't get honor while dead.
---
I agree that if you're the only reason someone died you should at least get partial honor, even if you died.
---
last 6 ony I have done either vis or bringer, but 0 ingots the entirety of classic
---
It has nothing to do with WoW. His entire streaming platform is built around fucking with asmon. He just does it through WoW. It’s obsessive and harassment.
---
I get you don’t want to see it as harassment. But if you actually thought for like 30 seconds it’s so obvious that you look ridiculous trying to argue it’s not.
---
As someone currently on rank 5. I totally get why you are camping lowbies - every honor counts etc pp, but how the fuck can you be proud enough to post such crappy shit? If you wanna show your big dick to the internet go farm equally geared and leveled players, otherwise go back into the whole you came from and keep farming that honor while not posting weakass shit videos you may think show great skill or special moments.
---
Why only warlocks? Not the only class with dots.
---
PVP is like the one place it's super viable to play anything other than Holy as a paladin, and being a Holy paladin in PVP is downright unfair because of how easily you can save other people, prevent frost mages and others from kiting and generally sit unkillable yourself. When BGs roll around, Paladins are gods of holding points and getting flags free from danger.
---
There is real sadness in Bobby B's character. The show does a decent job of showing this but truly he was a very conflicted character.
---
Ok sweet thanks!
---
He technically didn't get banned for stream sniping though. He got banned for targeted harassment towards another streamer.
---
Ive read somewhere, that once tank taunts Ragnaros and stands as much as possible to him, there is no way melee could over aggro him until next wrath. So this wasnt true. So if we overaggro, our tank doesnt do enough threat or melee has some lucky crits back to back, which pulls aggro from him?
---
Explain how he kills streamers when they are offline then....
---
I find the loudest in this game community toxic af. I honestly think they might have clinical depression. They’re so angry about everything. It’s not everyone, but there are enough to make me realize what I like about retail-not having to talk to them.
---
Kargath has no port mages on our server. Besides, doesn't that rack up costs quite quickly?
---
Yea, maybe for pleb guilds you get ganked for days. The good alliance guilds and players are still competing in pvp, ranking up, and even making it to raid with their buffs.  
---
Its pvp, its a battle, you should be prepared. So many alliance walking 1 at a time to instances, literally not even trying to stay alive when they get ganked just waiting to die. Its pathetic.   
---
I still die on my way to BRD multiple times if alliance has control, but I fight back, I aoe fear and pop a nifty stop watch, I kill the people I can. Play the game and quit bitching.
---
LHC was under ally control for 2 day straight.
---
I don’t share your experience at all. Reddit is pretty bad but actual ingame experience? Has been pretty great for me since release lots of down to earth people.
---
I always wondered what the difference was. How can one scan take 35 minutes and the other 10 seconds?
---
Maybe he's roleplaying as the typical dim-witted lower class English working man?
---
I honestly don't remember how they did the groupings in Vanilla. I do remember it was less than a week until the complaining about premades started. People would just give up if they encountered certain people / guilds on the other side.
---
sell faster on raid day, sell higher on other day, your choice
---
WARNING WARNING!!!!!!
---
While that is likely true you still have no incentive to transfer to a alliance dominated server. Only option is to reroll Alliance on a Alliance dominated or even realm.
---
people nostalgic for vanilla always seem to forget that gaming culture is completely different in the 15 years since this game started.
---
Time is money friend.
---
I don't so Mc anymore on my warrior. Pug takes 3-4 hours to have 2 chances at loots ? ( BB and Deathbringer...) F**k that....
---
...
---
no, black dragonscale or ony neck are DPS downgrade.
---
FFS, we all agree that 15 years ago people were utter morons when it came to game knowledge, but why the heck are people so obsessed with fire resist today? DPS is all that matters. do not sacrifice any DPS whatsoever for fire resist.
---
Great community on my pvp server.
---
oops :O
---
Not everyone wants to engage in PVP every time they step out in the world. Yes, then just play on a PVE server, but on a PVE server you also cant decide when to PVP or not, because at any given moment there might be nobody around that is flagged for PVP.
---
Its a catch22.
---
Soloable as 2..
---
You can trade retail gold for classic so you can technically buy classic gold without the fear of getting banned. Just find someone on your classic server that wants retail gold then buy a wow token on their retail server.
---
I will try to set it up tonight!
---
try to find a single log where a add randomly exploded
---
Ragnaros submerged on a tiny tiny sliver of health with most of the raid dead. Adds killed everyone else, boss popped back up and the last remaining healer killed him with a hammer of wrath moments before he would've died himself.
---
Basically, he had a 1v1 hammer fight with Rag
---
how many posts do you see here people bitching about that server?
---
I totally disagree lol. Wow classic has been one of the most wholesome and least toxic communities I have ever been apart of. 
---
 We lost to rag mutliple times where the dps spread was over 80k. (1st at 108k and last was 29k) and rag would have 10-35k helath left. 
---
 Nobody flamed anyone. Someone even accidentally agroed rag during everyone getting rezed and only had a few ppl left lol. Nobody got mad and we laughed it off. I imagine a situation like that would make you and these people you associate with absolutely livid lol. 
---
 It's what you make of it and you sound part of the problem.
---
Seriously  dude
---
people don't get it
---
this was like 0,00047% chance
---
Enlighten us, what do you mean?
---
I played human shadow priest in vanilla and unfortunately you will almost always be at a PvP disadvantage due to racials against horde as you noticed.. feedback is rarely useful and even with perception active rogues could still get me before I saw them.
---
That being said as a shadow priest you are still very powerful if played well, just not as much as you possibly could be as undead (or dwarf to a lesser extent)
---
Most people knew it was gonna be bad, but the scale of misery was unclear. I knew being a prot warrior meant I would lose most fights. What I didnt think possible was how unplayable every area in the game is.
---
Back in the day when servers had a tenth of the current population you could still get something done and maybe have a couple of 2v1 encounters here and there. Now its just 1v5 wherever you go. Forget about farming herbs in lvl 50+ zones. All I have been doing since phase 2 launched was buy elemental fire and supply raids with greater prot potions. The need to log in gets weaker every day. In a way phase 2 helped me get off the addiction this game has been since launch.
---
Yep, you then got flying in northrend and outlands (wotlk) and then flying everywhere in cata I think.
---
Tbc only had outland flying.
---
I ran ZF way longer then I should have in hopes Spellshock would drop......I had no idea they were that rare. FML
---
Cool. Our horde dominated server is always dominated by alliance. I think people run tribute non stop lol
---
I've been confused about spirit tap, do you have to get the final tick of damage for it to activate?
---
Hey! I was actually sitting there, re-doing my keybinds when I was attacked by this group the first time. If you watch the full video, you can see it. But yes, I had to click a 30 minute ability. You got me.
---
Well at least you got RP serv... Here we don't :(
---
As you can see, pretty much no one shares your horrible experience in game. Maybe it’s time to look for the one constant in all your negative encounters you claim you have. But that’s uncomfortable because it’s you.
---
If everyone is toxic maybe it’s time to reflect.
---
So glad I got to 60 in the 2 whole months before phase 2 came out on a PvP server.
---
what crackhead gave your locks ony head?
---
so I have a mage at lvlv 23, I was going AoE spec to try to aoe farm. But now that it's p2, is it worth trying to aoe farm at this level? Or should I respec into the improved Frostbolt, etc. leveling build?
---
Minus 50 DKP!
---
everyone sleeps on humans but god damn is it clutch in rogue v rogue
---
Some of the herb nodes are in patrol areas or need to be cleared to get. It’s not a huge money factor in there tbh
---
god status acheived
---
not exactly true, viskag is a 5% drop per slot it's valid for fyi, not 5% drop per kill.
---
I have a guild that I've been running with for years. The friendships man.
---
Fair enough although if you literally shift click someone IMO it should only show that guy, not everyone with a similar name. That is if it was working properly.
---
Yes, I realize that. The landscape would need some redesign, like climbable vines in Nargrand or a mini flight path to the netherdrake area.
---
Classic has just been a good example of how awesome the dangerous world is. Like when our weekly raid strategically gets to molten core and doesn't just fly over the world and danger.
---
you are right my bad, i forgot how stupid and entitled people have become, It is not like open world pvp have been a problem in wow for the past 15 years where they are still struggling to make a systems that works and can be fairly balanced. 
---
it is a crazy concept, reroll on a PVE server, I know I know, the whole world owes you your time you put into the character, and also the feeling the game gave you when you first played.... im sorry you did not get that as you demand.
---
Did somebody say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
All my friends quit so now I have to play by myself :(
---
Can you further explain this.
---
TBC without flying mounts? Are you serious? 
---
First of all 3 out of 7 zones are impossible to traverse without one (Shadowmoon, Blades's Edge and Netherstorm). 
---
The other 4 all have content that is custom made with flying in mind and work really well that way, I can't imagine Terrokar without the Arrakoa or Netherstorm without the boundaries set by it's fragmented landscape. 
---
I will agree the dailies were a sign of bad things to come, however up to Quel Danas isle they were pretty well managed as they gave some form of rewards without feeling compulsory.
---
On private servers it wasn't uncommon for Horde to queue in UC then fly to WPL or EPL to farm more honor while they wait for the queues. I think something similar can happen on some servers. The problem really is that for Alliance there is no incentive to guard the flight masters because they get instant queues, or probably will because Horde on most servers has a higher population and a higher percentage of Horde players do PvP. 
---
Regardless, it'll be much better once BGs are in.
---
Explain it to me, and I'll spread the word
---
Oof, sorry about your inability to afford efficiency.  My attitude may be shit but every downvote is unjustifiable jealously.
---
Heard some problem about the chat.
---
Some people just want to know if it's possible to buy it cheap from you and stop responding when they realized you know the real value of the item.
---
They don't disconnect tho x)
---
That's the thing.. the 30 min cds are vital too.. It's quite literally on kick level of "vitality".
---
I want a karazhan in classic like so much.
---
as someone who has basically AFK'ed to rank 3 in Ironforge, I don't believe u
---
there's a lot of valuable herbs that can be collected with herbalism in DM:E. Not from lashers. From actual herbs.
---
Selling those to buy whatever you need is probably faster than open world herbalism.
---
It's really not. Something like Retaliation is a cooldown you can use in an instant to save your life, as are the other two. Just because it has a longer cooldown doesn't make it any less important. If you want to click it because it's a long cooldown, you do you, but when you die because you clicked it that half second too late, you enjoy that run back to your corpse.
---
I am a frost mage. Some of my items have "+x amount of magical spell and healing power". Some items are more specific with spell power, such as only +frost spell power. And then there are damage modifiers.
---
What should I priorities? Is +magical spell power = frost spell power if the amount is the same? With, of course, magical spell power affecting all my spells?
---
How much more generic frost dmg would I need to outclass frost spell power?
---
I looked around and it's all rather confusing! TIA
---
Some would argue that he wasn't even stream sniping. People are simply relaying information in their twitch chats. If you know the dude is going to MC you don't need to snipe anything you just sit in BRM.
---
I’ve done 2 months worth of raiding ony and mc whenever it resets. Downed rag already too. I haven’t gotten a single piece of gear. -fellow fury warrior
---
If you're just going to be snide to an actual suggestion what was the point of this post.
---
Can I just add to that? 
---
I would love a TBC too without flying mount (which imo is one of the worst things that happened to the game) and dailies, but also no shamans on alliance and no paladins on horde side. Oh, and if Outlands wasn't separated from Azeroth, thus making Azeroth obsolete and dead - THAT would in my opinion be the best thing (game) ever. 
---
I know this is never going to happen, but I'm still allowed to hope for it :D
---
Ah cool, do you know where they said this? Would be fun to watch
---
Yeah because 50 something comments are truly representative.
---
I am not a nice guy. But I am also not an asshole. I just want to play the game without having to deal with this kind of shit.
---
I agree, stockades is supposed to be a story dungeon.
---
&gt;forced to play PvP 100% of the time
---
Exactly that. Is the difference that hard to understand? Do you not find a difference between phase 1 and 2?
---
The petrified dunes beyond reminded me of desolace, too!
---
So you're going to start all over from level 1? Respect, I couldn't do it.
---
I like your style man, truly do. Please get a lvl 20+ alliance side on literally an other PvP server before complaining about the only alliance heavy realm.
---
I've seen you bring this up a couple times, it's definitely a bad look considering all the accusations against Advertise but I'd like more info, was he in the process of hunting Asmongold at the time? Or did he hunt him shortly after? Was he already interacting with Asmongold and wanted to hear his reaction? It's important to remember that Advertise's YouTube channel revolves around Asmongold/his friends and guild, and he uses highlights of Asmongold's gameplay, reactions and things he says in his videos, even in the rare videos that aren't solely about killing him so Advertise probably watches Asmongold's stream when he can't interact with him for content ideas.
---
Also let's not pretend like hunting people who are on your server is some arduous task, Advertise is well known on his server so people who are out in the world are going to constantly whisper Advertise with information, not to mention he literally pays for a second account with an alliance character dedicated to /whoing Asmongold's characters to see which zone he's in.
---
Are there any good wow classic podcasts out there?
---
Thunderfury normally goes to tanks then dps warriors if none of the tanks want it right?
---
Molten Core does look rather simplistic now, but man I didn’t notice any of it when I played it in Vanilla. First time I saw and fought Ragnaros I was blown away.
---
Meh, I'm a 59 druid, and it's possibly the best corpse running class, cus you can stealth, Sprint, feral charge, shift out of roots. Sure you still take a few deaths, but fewer than my poor warrior friends
---
ok
---
The barrens isn’t a contested zone though.
---
DM was originally a much lower level dungeon? That doesn't even fit with the level range for Feralas so I wonder how they were planning out that zone back then.
---
&gt; server pop 4x bigger than in vanilla
---
Highest recorded concurrent players from Classic addons was only 1.5x bigger than highest recorded concurrent players from Vanilla.
---
baseline value is broken. do not use the baseline value as what to expect. in my experience it is better.to vendor or auction everything
---
Eventually ;)
---
Love how this gets downvoted. Such Reddit mentality
---
'lets not answer his question, let's tell him hes wrong and move on with our day'
---
Just don't bother commenting if you're gonna say 'dont do the thing you're asking about'. He's clearly decided that's what he wants to do.
---
I didnt.  I assume a moderator took it down.  It still seems to be here, just not showing on the main list *shrug*
---
So, a magical spell power bonus of 14 is not worse than an item with 14 frost power (or dmg), for example? Thx for the clarification!
---
And how much Intel trumps spell power?
---
I know in gadget the mages know exactly what to do to avoid guard aggro most of the time. When they do get it, they escape with no penalty.
---
That's what Horde did on private servers, but it's easily defendable with a few mages
---
Lol we're still only ever talking about pixels on a screen.
---
It was 40:60 to begin with, now its around 30:70, if we look at lv40+ players.
---
I ended up just rerolling on a normal PVP server since RP-PvP servers were completely pointless anyways. Why bother subjecting yourself to naming rules if nobody is RPing anyways.
---
It's tempting to just roll on a normal RP server to try it out, but pre-BGs that just sounded so boring.
---
Finally someone with a decent brain. Thanks My G
---
&gt; so I have to PVP all the time every day
---
How hard is this? A PVP server means PVP may be mandatory.
---
Mandatory: required by laws or rules.
---
When you see "PVP" next to a server it means this has a set of 'rules'. So yes, you might have to PVP. That's what a PVP server is.
---
Id bet my left nut you play horde on a horde dominated server
---
idk, I always seem to get murdered by 4-5 Rogues + Druids whenever I hop onto or off a Zeppelin on Heartseeker.
---
The community is so bad now. World pvp was nothing like this in real vanilla.
---
We got Bloodfang, Dragonstalker's, Essence of the Pure Flame, Cloak of the Shrouded Mists and Spinal Reaper :)
---
Shh dont let the secret out.
---
Why pick a PvP server if you don't 'want' to PvP?
---
Do you think faction and realm change will ever be a thing in Classic?
---
What keeps me playing retail is farming gold for tokens to play classic. 
---
What keeps me playing classic is AV and Naxx
---
I had a green dagger level 58-60 or something and it was showing disenchant value of like 17g because greater eternal essence is spiking in value on my server - about 8g each.  IIRC disenchants aren't always the same though so you might get less valuable mats.
---
Imagine only getting killed 12 times a writing a post about it
---
Congrats to the hunter who won them all!
---
I had some nice short-time encounters with roleplayers while leveling. Once I reached higher levels it stopped. Either they left Classic all together or joined a full RP server. Shame, really.
---
I thought it was pretty clear. Back door is just north of the horde town.
---
I quest from 1-3am server time and still get ganked every 2-5 minutes and I play on a balanced server.  You have no idea what you're talking about and all the posts and comments in the last few weeks say the complete opposite.  
---
Nobody is logging in to take 2-3 hours to do something that should take only 20 minutes.
---
Don't even understand your last point.  Of course private server players are gonna no life this game.  But new players and people who don't care that much are just gonna give up and move on.  It's 2019, we have Steam and lots of other games to play, no need to waste my few precious hours I have after work to just constantly get ganked and make no progress.
---
Oh...
---
It's been pretty organized for Skeram horde figured it wasn't the same for everyone.
---
What about gnomes and their escape artist racial. Also dwarf preist get fear ward, which is super OP
---
Sure, it's good right now and for a few more weeks, but what possible is there to spend a large amount of money and make your upgrade path harder for no discernable advantage?
---
The "hard to replace" situation is a significant drawback of the set. If it was clearly the best choice, this wouldn't matter, but it's not. It's simply a good option, about equal to others, why then take the option, which makes upgrading the hardest?
---
Is that Bryce Canyon?
---
Yes for it to proc you must deal the killing blow
---
The cooldown is pretty cheap and frankly I don't know why anyone would even sell them aside from lvl 35 alts - anyone with alchemy on their main would be much better off getting any of the more profitable transmute recipes. Earth to water is fairly easy to get and should still be far better than arcanite on most servers.
---
Good one. Very clever and creative. 
---
Sheep
---
What map add on is that? I’ve never seen one where it doesn’t take up the whole screen, would love to know.
---
Ty, cheers
---
Yeah obviously classic + is the way to go but I don’t think the community trusts Blizzard to do it right, and TBC is universally loved so they’re better off just releasing that next.
---
We had this exact same thing happen with Majordomo. Our priest was last alive and killed the last add with shadow word pain.
---
xD
---
Hunters were drowning in loot from the other 9 anyway...
---
I have an addiction.
---
So now the choice of a PvP server means you can't want anything else ever? There is other content in the game my friend. The game's quite famous for it.
---
I ask myself the same thing twice a week when we kill ony as a resto shaman.
---
I’ve never played classic and want to experience all the content and have gear competitive to be able to do so. (I played tbc- cat) Also the people I play with are fun and I enjoy playing with them.
---
Faction balance was never this bad on private servers, I don't think there was any way to expect 80/20 servers. PvP is fine when factions are balanced.
---
In the video I mention several times using dots on off targets, which by the time the raid focuses them they expire.
---
could you possibly post a link for the actual weakaura for the crit route i cant get it to work would be greatly appreciated
---
Right?  Because one lone leveling rogue is supposed to wipe out a group of 60s.  
---
Try harder.
---
Your a pussy.
---
Yeah but you just need to escort them to the chest. One invis potion is needed.
---
&gt; you gave 3 responses 
---
And you quoted 4. Jesus christ the kids an idiot!
---
&gt; there's a difference 
---
Yea, and there's a difference between PVE and PVP servers. Maybe you're not such an idiot.
---
&gt; in Vanilla
---
Ok boomer. Its 2019 and Classic. Stop reliving the good ol days of D-Day. 
---
&gt; two extremes
---
He didn't list two anything? He said what you should expect to possibly happen on a PVP server (which is not "be left alone"). You are an idiot.
---
I would like this too
---
How do you control it when everyone and their dog has access to ony heads and the 6h cooldown was designed for 5x smaller server population in the days when killing onyxia was an actual accomplishment?
---
Fuck the haters. You're doing God's work.
---
Why do you think twitch did it then dipshit? 
---
Seriously. Maybe head over to /conspiracy and post your latest take on why you think twitch banned him. What’s their motive?
---
I play PvE just like 15 years ago because I want to experience the game not deal with some no-lifers only wanting to cause other people grief.
---
So I cant do this if I forgot to pick up a quest item because respawns?
---
It's about the concept of buying power with real life money... where do you want to draw the line?
---
Not dotting off targets which have hardly any debuffs on them is as well.
---
1 int gives 15 more max mana, but other than that it just gives a small amount of crit.
---
You need 59.5 int to get 1% crit. And for a pre-raid BiS geared mage 1% crit = roughly 6 spelldmg, so in pure damage numbers (ignoring mana) 10 intellect is the same damage as 1 spellpower.
---
It’s called Leatrix Maps (classic)
---
The innkeeper is in the bottom of the zeppelin tower I think
---
I'm thankful for RP server. Imagine cringe the normal servers would without them.
---
Not the guy you asked, but all Dire Maul instances are actually one large instance, not three separate ones. You can actually physically run from DM:W to DM:N for example (the path is from the Arcaneum (library) in DM:N and leads to Immol'thar's chamber in DM:W). As far as I know, you can't go to the other ones from DM:E, but it's still the same instance. That means if you die anywhere in the instance, you can resurrect by taking any of the entrances.
---
There's a back door to DM:E, located north of Camp Mojache, but you need the Crescent Key for it. If you enter there, you should take off your breakable gear, die to the mobs, and resurrect in whichever part of Dire Maul you wish.
---
Tell those bum ass alliance who transferred to Heartseeker from Herod to come back to Herod, it's a god damn slaughter here
---
4 stats to chest is pretty rare on my server
---
Nonono you must be completely right. 
---
All the People complaining are stupid retail scrubs that can't figure the game out.
---
Everyone that is not complaining is a fcking pro. It is not like the People complaining are the one on the loosing faction and the others are the dominant faction.
---
What would be so bad to have a solution to this Problem? It is not like anybody is trying to steal honor from you - stop you from ganking.
---
All he is asking for is a Change so People stop leaving the game. I know you are probably not bothered but People are playing with friends etc. and if they leave that really does bother me. 
---
Then again. I know you Argument.
---
"you rolled on a pvp Server you have to deal with this shit" and you are 100% correct. I started twinking because I couldn't take being ganked anymore. But I am still on a pvp Server because I myself want the ability to PVP whenever I want to.
---
It is a stupid Thing/Problem really. Afterall we just have to wait until BG's come out I guess :P
---
At least I'm 47 with my rogue by now xD
---
No, it doesn't slow down the raid, when they're already getting it done. Plus, when you gear a bunch of people up and they begin dropping for better guilds who DO reward effort... THAT slows down the raid.
---
Does anyone know what addon he uses for bars and specially that weapon, cape, boots helm switching/usage?
---
In the video I never mention dotting the focused target by the raid, only off targets who have no debuffs on them.
---
give menethil harbor real guards
---
The choice means you get your playtime disturb whenever wherever. If you wanted to experience the other content you would have rolled PvE.
---
He is gaining the ability to be 11 places at the same time..
---
This is like buying gold but instead of paying a farming bot he is paying blizzard.
---
it also depends on your play style. BDS set is best for full AP ret right now. Different story if you're hybrid/spelladin of course. And raids gear will be harder to get no matter what. For a fresh 60 ret going full AP. BDS is just the best option. And if you dont want to wait for an upgrade you can always go some other path. 
---
For example. For BWL I will have to get a leg drop and a shoulder drop before I can replace the gear. I'm okay with that.
---
This is literally a photo shop.
---
Perception can be huge if you use it with spy and engineering. 
---
Spy goes off, pop perception and a nade. 
---
Fuck up that rogues opener, get dots and a mind blast off to screw with their kidney shot. 
---
Once they get into melee, fear them and mindflay till your mb is off CD. 
---
At this point kite and let dots tick away.
---
&gt;	This insane exclusionary force that tries to invalidate any and all criticisms of their holy Classic
---
Why would you criticize a retro publication of a 15y old game? Like if cs 1.6 was rereleased why would you cry that it isn’t csgo?
---
I mean, one of the things I dislike most about being Horde at the moment is the Zeppelin shit. 
---
I'd been so used to playing a Night Elf druid in Vanilla that Horde transportation sucks. Our closest hub to BRM is Kargath (which is always camped by 20+ allies on Heartseeker) or Grom'gol (usually camped by 5 or so Rogues) while Alliance can just chill in Ironforge (which is an amazing city btw) and take a 2 minute flight path to Thorium Point. 
---
If you use the Zeppelin from Grom'gol to Org or UC, you're usually going to get killed at the gates by camping Allies if you haven't already been thoroughly raped in the Zeppelin by a Rogue/Druid gank squad. 
---
I get that flight paths in Alliance zones aren't so well protected, but it isn't all rainbows and unicorns for the Horde either (on Ally-dominated servers like Heartseeker, especially).
---
Ally does the same thing though. I was stealthed on a boat, and a bunch of ?? Ally followed me around until the boat zoned, and they one shotted me. 
---
Alliance did this same thing in BFA. But they would only do it after having Warmode for weeks, crying about Horde, and only turned it on once Blizzard gave them increased rewards.
---
If you thought "nobody will camp FPs when WPVP is the only way to get honor" well, welcome to video games I guess?
---
if you’re being aoe down by 20 horde i fucking promise those guards aren’t gonna help much lol 
---
pvp servers on this game weren’t made for everyone. these casual players were convinced to roll PVP because their buddies are a little more hardcore, and can afford the time of death runs and occasional body camping. 
---
if you’re on a pvp server and you’re mad to the point of quitting because of how world pvp works, then please don’t let the door hit you on the way out :) 
---
that’s NOT to say we can’t discuss ways to improve the current system, but if you’re willing to quit over it then it’s likely classic isn’t the game for you and there will be many more occasions in which a casual play-style will be punished in terms of time available to play. i have plenty of friends with 40-60 hour work weeks, and they are fully geared with plenty of honor! they get very pissed off on multiple corpse runs, zep campers and body griefing. but i’ve never once heard them threaten to quit over it.. they love the game too much for that
---
Movement speed on boots isn't niche as it's the best echant for pretty much everyone.
---
I´ve seen a lot of ppl who have icons to switch gear like trinket menu but for other slots [like on this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e22ces/hunter_etiquette_prt2_broken_tooth_has_been_tamed/). Does anyone know what addon does that?
---
The entire south of Kalimdor has tons of quests about Silithids and how they are invading, and Silithus basically being fully dedicated to it, plus the war effort event leading up to it. Compared to MC where you find a random elf in Blackrock mountain that asks you to click a rock inside BRD.
---
There are diminishing return everytime you kill the same player. They are not farming after killing 3 times.
---
Follow up question, melee is getting hit a lot by aoe lava burst for 1k ish each hit. I thought this was only targeted at casters - is our melee healer(s) or something other caster too close to us and being targeted?
---
If I would be the slowest to get to the instance, maybe. But in practice, I hearth to Grom'Gol, zepp to org and fly to Feralas and I'm still not the last in the instance. There's always someone coming from EPL or winterspring with his HS on cooldown.
---
Usually, spending money getting there fast just means I've lost money while the group doesn't start any quicker.
---
Fucking awesome. Hope that dude gets perma banned for the shit he does. Dudes got legit fucking problems being obsessed with Asmon so much.
---
Our AMB line is 11 people deep, so i graciously accepted the staff last week. We've had 1 blade drop and our 5th staff dropped last night.
---
Obtaining endgame gear is too dependent on luck and mindless grinding.
---
In my experience, leveling warrior is probably the slowest and most tedious class to level in wow classic, however it is extremely rewarding and I do still enjoy playing my warrior, also very nice to not have to look for a tank for groups.
---
Same thing happened to me. I was super excited for some rp like in Neverwinter nights, but sadly nothing yet.
---
Ah, so it do the trick by multi-threading and sending shitton of requests that low-end PC can't handle.  
---
I always was curious how it's possible to be that much faster.
---
Askin the real questions
---
yeah, really useful to have a tank spamming buffs during a boss fight
---
If the queue is to long they should just transfer servers. either way it works its self out
---
If your tank doesn’t want it they should be gkicked, pelted with soft tomatoes, and forced to walk across 100 meters of legos
---
Keeping my guild from walking into traffic
---
And Horde has none of those...?
---
It's tracked via the skeram discord and at this point it's being used pretty reliably at the same times. Sure someone could throw a wrench in it if they wanted to but it's to everyone's benefit to get the head out around the time everyone plans to raid.
---
Do not use your shield on rage tanks, unless it's an emergency. They generate less rage which hinders them doing their job.
---
Shields are for casters to prevent push back, not for tanks.
---
They said paid server changes are likely coming, and it is the only paid service they're considering.
---
I don't see them ever adding faction changes since paladins and shamans are faction exclusive and you can't be breaking guilds apart like that.
---
If it generates threat, who cares?
---
Me and my friends have been collecting screenshots of RP profiles with in-your-face RP shit in them so we can laugh at them. We've done it for years.
---
I've... Seen things.
---
the tainted scar, part of the blasted lands map nowdays
---
There are gonna be so many thunderfuries in P3 man it's crazy
---
We have 6-7 hunters in our MC raids, so the competition is heavy. And loot council is only for some items, so Tier stuff is just /roll 100 and hope for the best.
---
I don't understand the dislike for flying in TBC. It was only in later expansions where it became an issue for me. Also druid flight form OP
---
Horde have better PvP and PvE abilities. Just because alliance have fear ward and escape artist doesn't change the imbalance
---
Don't let facts get in the way of Alliance whining, please.
---
This. If all grind like mad, it forces others who are targeting r14 to grind like mad as well. If people who are targeting r14 (within the same faction) cooperate, nobody needs to grind 18+hours to get the rank.     
---
But honestly, I would be surprised if all the people these days(higher server capacity, more people who want r14 and more competitiveness) would come to an agreement.
---
Yes it is.  It's a pretty wonderous place, feels like an alien landscape when you're there.
---
Sunk cost fallacy
---
That's not always the case, so it really depends on the group.  
---
Also, I solo trib runs so its def worth it to teleport and fly a shorter distance.  
---
Whatever works best for you, but 1g really aint that much (and some mages take less).  
---
Plus I'll always have mage water.
---
What about randoms that don't even know about the discord?
---
Bryce Canyon rules.  A+
---
I was going to say, it’s not just faction imbalance. Horde has more no life losers with full raid gear and epic mounts. It’s honestly pathetic.
---
I'm pretty sure I heard someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
I tried, but it doesn't read like Tainted Scar.
---
Blade's Edge was horrible, even with flying!
---
i want more of these
---
39 other people who would rather a real tank was there doing 300+ DPS
---
'cool' no. Funny for about 5 seconds until you realise that would go both ways.
---
Gotta love the WPVP Horde/Alliance imbalance not only in the racials but the extra / better flight paths horde get + the ability to camp our only way to the other continent while their zepplins are in the air and in Horde territory preventing Alliance from doing the same shit as this.   
---
People arnt pointing out that this is menethil so they basically own the docks and the ship.
---
Shuuuush easy mode scrub.
---
It may be the same company by name (let's ignore the Activision part), but it's not the same people, mindset or passion.
---
watching a stream is harassment?
---
We have loot council and some epic gun dropped in MC. "Not for hunters because you get your Rhok". Yeah sure, but there's 7 active hunters in our guild so with some unlucky rolls and no quest objects, it may take 2 months or more to get that while that gun was a big upgrade for me.
---
But no, went as a stat stick to a warrior. Sure, may be a BiS, but a stat stick is a stat stick in my opinion and I could have done way more dps right away.
---
Hi, /u/LevinSaber91

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e2znh6/yep_i_have_no_life/). 
---
My classic server never used VC and we never had a debate, and we made it just fine.
---
Is your raid living and doing well with clears? If so that can put healing to the back of the gear line in favor of DPS getting increases for faster clears.
---
Yeah, I think Thrall says something like "yeah, it might be a good thing that the Alliance gets fucked by a Dragon hiding among them, but if the Alliance gets fucked, we're next"
---
You'd better spec into a proper leveling spec. AoE farming solo is very risky on a PvP server and I'm not seeing as many spellcleave groups nowadays. I think it was just something at the beginning of Classic that faded away.
---
Eh, I personally find that Retail's lore has just gotten too... Over the top. We've passed the Naruto Threshold, and if you want to interact with newer content in a meaningful way your character has to be some kind of superhero.
---
Classic is nice because the "Power level" is still pretty low, and the lore is still more world-focused instead of superheroic storyline focused.
---
That’s still bannable
---
Prot paladin auto attacks won't do 300+ DPS anyway. The argument here was purely about threat, which they can do decently well until they run oom.
---
Yeah nice try there you think I’m gonna fall for that????
---
How do you get them past the reavers and guard in the ramp/bug room without invis pots?
---
&gt; If you play on a pvp realm, Horde is strictly the game on easy.
---
Ever tried playing Horde on Heartseeker? I dare you. I double dare you.
---
Oh god. I really want to see a gallery of the best ones. Names blacked out ofcourse.
---
I have no problem with people putting effort into their profiles but if the "About" section is just "Loves women, has a big d\*ck" you're just mocking RP.
---
I imagine it's something like that?
---
I did not know there was a backdoor damn
---
Wow. It's amazing that you went into such an in depth explanation for a stranger! Thanks! Since I'm daggers I guess I'll stop doing anger runs for now and leave that as low priority.
---
Ironforge is like a 2 minute flight from Thorium Point.
---
I want my Shaman spacegoat :/
---
To be honest, Robe of the archmage is better than Robe of volatile power. Robe of volatile power is better than robe of the void. If they are going to prioritize gear, why woudn't you give it to the warlock since it's BiS for them, but it's not BiS for mages? Just craft yourself Archmage. She went to the hassle of crafting ROTV knowing she would replace it in MC, but you won't craft Archmage knowing you'll keep it?
---
Second point, Loot Council is Horrible for casual guild because the leadership isn't as invested in the game, less knowledge = more mistake in loot distribution and it's a recipe for drama. Go with DKP or just roll it off. Loot Council is only suitable when the progression of the raid group comes before the individual. That means hardcore raiding with a serious guild and competent, selfless leaders.
---
Streamer culture and min-maxing has ruined a portion of classic for me. Everyone so focused on BiS, reserving items, devilsaur mafias, people copying/loot funneling streamers etc. 
---
Now the overwhelming ganking that's going on is just a game ruiner. My friend is level 55 and was loving the game, but I honestly don't think he'll make it to 60 because he can't do any quests without constant ganks.
---
I just wanna play for fun.
---
Yup. Otherwise I'd for sure have any number of mounts and gear items in game that i've been trying to get for years. Invincible's Reins or Ashes of A'lar comes to mind.
---
F-Tier is something like survival hunter. Enhancement shaman is like a C-/D+, it's pretty okay.
---
yeah, the social stigma on RP feels the other way around this time. On Defias it was expected somewhat to use \* ooc \* if not speaking in character in /s. There were still plenty of non-rp ers but they generally seemed to not speak out of character as much as you see now on ZT. Maybe it's a horde thing though this time around, with fanboys joining Gravediggers not caring about its ruleset.
---
Lol, nice story bro.
---
40:60 is very much expected ratio for pvp server in a favor of horde since they have better pvp racials.
---
I hate to be that old guy (not even 30 lol) but people just seem way shittier to eachother. Few people are polite, treat eachother like pure trash and don't seem tgaf...
---
I had the same thing happen. Updated 5 add-ons and it broke a bunch of stuff, questie being one of them. Luckily I had a backup copy of my add-ons so I justed deleted the whole addon directory and replaced it.
---
Honest question, what is your goal when you tell people they should have picked pve? Is it wanting people to go back in time, or wanting to feel mentally superior?
---
The druid thingy is pretty RP though.
---
People don't speak cat or bear or cheetah or chicken, so you have to morph back. Though picking up plants doesn't make much sense, though I guess a bear "could" pick up plants if they were to be careful...
---
Since the hotfix it wipes it completely and it has 100% been figured out.
---
We can 90% of the time get our off-tank to pick her up when she lands. The last 10% is because our DPS during phase 2 fluctuates to much and we are not really caring/paying attention.
---
But they've got to allow transfers according to faction and not facilitate an even worse imbalance.
---
What blows my mind is how flawed people are at "farming" honor.. even with this pve large group farm mentality nonsense why kill someome more than 3 times lol
---
-__- dr exists even if it says your estimated honor is ***
---
Good for you pal. Unfortunately I have a job and other life commitments that kept me from playing as much as I would've liked. That, and I decided to play a warrior.
---
BRM switches factions pretty frequently on Grobb in my experience. I've seen alliance controlling the place as often as I've seen horde.
---
Its almost more about what you dont say. You don't need an elaborate back story or anything like that to jump in. Just avoid modern slang and RL references and you're 99% of the way there. Talking in your "racial accent" is pretty popular and adds another layer if you like.  
---
Asking a few personal questions will make other RPers love you as it gives them the chance to describe their characters. 
---
So instead of "yo bro! Sick new dagger, did that drop in SM?" You can say "Hail brother! Is that a new blade? Ive seen a similar design weilded by the Scarlet monks." 
---
One thing to avoid: you never wanna write someone elses story for them. So try to avoid making up personal details for other players in your own RP. Let them join in or not, but its not like improv where everyone will be happy to "yes and" you.
---
))
---
Yes please will pay much money
---
It really hasn't been a issue yet. Maybe because people only get one chance to grief it? I dunno.
---
If, and only if, you are a warrior here's a trick I use.  Attack elementals (they're all or nearly all bleed immune) and spam rend on them.  Since they're immune, it will refund the rage cost and you can just keep at it, getting in an extra swing every 1.5 secs.
---
&gt; PvP server and PvP happens
---
Lmao ok dude, good talking. I’m done wasting my time with someone who answers this kind of stupid stuff.
---
Have the last word bye.
---
People are obsessed with BiS items and reserving items. It's so damn annoying.
---
It’s not like his lvl 2 priests can farm the black lotus for him. He still has to compete with everyone else on the server for the spawn. 
---
I’d say it’s pretty fucking easy to distinguish that from someone buying R14 from an in game shop.
---
D&amp;D is where I started, but I've been really enjoying the RP in WoW. 
---
One of the cool things about RPing in wow is how your characters gets to meet so many, what would be NPCs made by your DM, but in WoW they are other players. It's led to very interesting developments and changes with characters. 
---
My first character was more the cold shoulder style of elf priestess, met another elf where they just kicked it off. It's really been a fun romance, but you might be more sold on the other player's recent experience on a new night elf. 
---
So young rather cocky and careless male elf. Flirting with all the girls really not serious. Was playing with my own very serious and wild druid. Well he flirted with quite a shadow priestess in Darnassus. She mind fucked him, basically being a lawful evil alignment, telling him that he had to grow up as the Kaldorei have many enemies and he cannot be only concerned with flirting and such. 
---
That one chance meeting completely changed his character arc. So I guess D&amp;D offers of course more flexibility and I still prefer. But in WoW it is rather fun to be spinning a character story with so many others. I really prefer it to the non-RP version of WoW. Do have to mention though, that is my experience on Bloodsail, can't speak to the RP-PvP, just the RP-PvE.
---
Well by the time you picked I’m sure you saw the extensive statements from blizzard about layering and modern realm populations.
---
This was Emerald Dream in vanilla.  All PvP and no RP.
---
Agreed. While there has been some minor drawbacks recently, the entire experience has been fantastic for me. I only play at night now but I just got my second 60 (just in the perfect time....I rushed the last 10 levels once honor was released) and my guild has legit been the best part of all of this. 
---
It’s an amazing and laid back west coast guild. We aren’t hardcore but we raid like it. Full clearing MC/Ony in two raid groups in 2.5 hours weekly and will probably start a third soon. Our growth has been tremendous and our discord is always active! The game itself is fun but if I wasn’t in such an awesome guild, I would probably just raid log and run M+ or keep mythic raiding in retail. We’re always having a blast and gambling (seriously this guild is a bunch of addicts lol) and even if we wipe or fail, it doesn’t matter because we’re doing it as a group. Everyone helps each other out and has their teammates backs. 
---
Just a few years ago I would have never guessed I would be playing vanilla instead of pushing for CE on my warlock. Love it.
---
Jesus fucking Christ this is getting old.  
---
I played on a PvP server when I was 13, and didn't complain as much IN TOTAL as people on this sub bitch in one day. 
---
Yes I was camped. I was gang attacked, corpse-camped, there were days I got nothing done because the area I was levelling in was getting majorly camped. 
---
World of Warcraft is an open-world MMORPG with levels introduced. When you enter a PvP server, you will meet other faction players who will be higher level, or outnumber you, and you will get ganked on occasion. It's part of the experience. If you don't like that or it's putting you off, maybe you shouldn't be on a PvP server.
---
This sub is becoming so whiny it's honestly getting frustrating. I know y'all like to make light of the "this is a PvP server" response but, yeah, **it's a PVP server.** You will, occasionally, be outnumbered and attacked without having a chance of survival or retaliation. It's genuinely part of the experience.
---
That's true but from what I gathered from the video, tweets etc. The manager was the owner as it was a smaller restaurant. Either way, it doesn't change the fact that Twitch didn't verify any of this and banned without context. Especially given after days of no contact, they got back in touch to say "Oh oops lol", despite losing days of streaming.
---
There are more Allies on PvE realms and there are more Horde on PvP realms. 
---
It balances out, pretty much.
---
I'd pay 100 bucks right now to faction swap to alliance from horde on Skeram. I wish I'd have rolled Alliance at the start, but horde were outnumbered in vanilla so I assumed it would be similar. I just don't want to lose the hundreds of hours I've put in at this point by rerolling.
---
Should still get it. I will too but yeah dont lose sleep over it lol. I was at work and was waiting for a go ahead for something with nothing else to do so.. ;)
---
The shapeshift thing is really annoying, I definitely agree. And Taurens not being able to fit through the doors in UC when mounted... come on man
---
Insane lies? I die around 12-14 times every time I want to go to MC or BRD. So shut the fuck up. He's not lying.
---
yup so the argument is to redesign it enough that you dont need flying
---
Is that new for Classic?  I swear that used to happen in Vanilla.
---
People warned about most things you describe waaaay before Classic was even launched https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the_argument_for_adding_wsg_in_phase_2/
---
The idea of horde being dominant on pvp servers for better pvp racials was obvious as well. Server transfers definitely worsened the situation but it's still better than queues.
---
&gt;the census was not a good indication of reality at all in my opinion
---
Err why is it so? Is there any better objective data source?
---
Sorry, was in a rush, couldn't elaborate.
---
BB/Mirah's spreadsheets higher DPS than the Dalrend sword set by quite a bit.
---
My MC geared rogue #'s
---
Krol/Mirah's: 613 DPS
---
Dalrend set: 620 DPS
---
BB/Mirah's: 638 DPS
---
Vis'kag/Mirah's: 640 DPS
---
Prioritize getting +healing off set gear, it’s not super important at your level but you’ll get a ton of mileage out of it at later levels. When actually healing you want to sit and do nothing for as long as possible to let your mana passively regen, whenever the tank starts to get into the danger zone you want to use your biggest heal you have + a max rank renew and repeat the process of sitting around trying to let your mana regen. Also if you’re shadow, try to snipe killing blows with wand/mind blast whenever possible for spirit tap. Doing this should help keep your mana at a healthy rate and avoid making you have to drink more than once every now and then.
---
Just git gud op you should of clearly just not been such a carebare /s
---
He's only cake if your DPS is in Bis, if not it's going to wipe most newer players.
---
He doesn't have to be alive. You can see lotus nodes while dead. Park dead level 2 character at lotus spawn, set a weak aura to \*audio ping\* in the background when one spawns, run your main there to pick it. Game over.
---
Or the tiny crab critters in searing gorge
---
&gt; Epic quality
---
doesn't matter
---
&gt; two more slots
---
true but not worth the ~600-800g it sells for (not for long though :D)
---
I was literally going to ask on here how to turn those sounds down.  The tiniest waterfalls are like I'm standing underneath Niagara falls
---
Just wanted to share the feeling I think a lot of wow players are going through right now😉
---
Later dude, hope you find someone to hold your hand.
---
It's things like having to run all the way back to Ragnaros' room. The almost totally random placement of bosses without much thought to their surroundings.
---
I loved Karazhan as a raid. Probably the most fun and repeatable raid for me. Black Temple was amazing and a challenge, but Kara was awesome! I never did get the mount though :(
---
This gave me a seizure.
---
Priest! Fav class. Shadow is nasty
---
Confirmation bias
---
Even with his location written out you couldn’t find him lol
---
people will stop farming HK at fp and in the worlds they will do bg. I know it sucks man cant really farm on my server either unless i form a guild group
---
Sounds like someone doesn't have the ability to prove a point easily either ;) Guess he didn't do anything like you claimed after all! Thanks for clarifying!
---
what ui is tht, super clean
---
Probably means rudder
---
Sounds like someone doesn't have the ability to prove a point easily either ;)
---
You’re bad at grammar.
---
Yah right.  Level 2 out there?  That's a Horde main keeping an Ally alt to scout for kills.
---
If you are using it to farm DME you do not need to track mining nodes because you know where they are.  One thing to keep in mind is 1 arcane crystal buys a lot of herbs.  I had herbing for 3 days and farmed up \~40 mushrooms which is about the same as 1 Arcane crystal.  So if choosing between the two, mining wins.
---
That's because the RP Policy back in the days was brutal.
---
Now it's a joke. (A naming policy, that's it.)
---
I prefered the old rules.
---
If I remember correctly, mind control does NOT suffer from diminishing returns :p
---
Thank you for your kind words, friend.
---
Farmed out 1000 kills so far and had to stop due to phase 2 pvp.  I will get it some day!
---
Kinda niche but +herbalism skill makes it so you’re less likely to get a failed attempt on black lotus, mountain silversage, dreamfoil, icecap, plaguebloom. Failed attempts are annoying af imo so I always get +5 herb on my farming gloves.
---
I have noticed that this new pvp craze hurts people around lv 48+. 
---
Aoe zones in the western plague lands was the worst. It was hard farming in that area. I was lv 52 when the honor system started. My wife was much lower . I'd help her out in the 30-now 46lv. Its been easy in those areas, for the most part.
---
No but they could, for example allow migration to rebalance factions.
---
The cross faction transfer is by far the best idea with minimal downside.  The only "significant" one is that shammies would have to turn into pallies, but that would be their choice.
---
For me, I wanted the reliability of the agility enchant rather than being at the mercy of a proc.  Also, my advantage was so large a proc would have often been overkill (although the healing may have been nice).
---
No idea. I was a drooling casual pvp child then.
---
That boat was already a death trap before phase 2 on my server. Always filled to the brim with horde. For me the alliance boats are save though.
---
Got 60 first week on a PvP server. In near full raid BIS/ have a full PvP set that. I still cannot go from Red Ridge/ Searing Gorge/ Burning Steppes. Without being killed 10+ times. My guild has fallen into a raid logging model as a result. That being said, we routinely win 20v60 during non peak hours in brm. But during peak hours that turns into 40v120 and we cannot do anything. The alpha strike that many people, in comms, can do is insane.

Before someone says "just sapper" we do, that's how we typically win. Invis sapper alphas are fun. But we have over used them and people now stay spread so we can only get 5 instead of 40.
---
LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL Yes, you can win 1v1's as a human priest. Yes you need t get better. YES Horde have better racials.   
---
If you want the easy way out then you go Horde. But you can still beat and win against them as a human priest you just have to not be bad.
---
Not much of a setup...is this a troll post
---
You need to get the killing blow on anything lvl 48+
---
Did you really just suggest that warriors do less DPS than casters?
---
Im pretty sure i heard some one say STFU
---
Ally do it too, Horde do it more...because there are more of you. How do Horde not get this still?
---
Hi
---
&gt;theres no social bonding, no social skills r beeing used no real work behind
---
Im in my current guild due to becoming friends with a pair of brothers in 3 hours of a BRD run. Many of our guild members are a result of the same sort of thing. We became friends due to the time commitment of classic dungeons
---
Unless you're referring strictly to the lfg part, which I wouldn't entirely disagree
---
It’s not just simple math lol. I don’t think this is the case for every dominated server, and what’s wrong with setting up guard rails to help deter these situations from resulting? Also, I’m not advocating for a perfect 50/50 split.
---
view looks great, but how are you doing the input?
---
Do jump runs with a warrior who’s willing to give you the rich thorium
---
The flip side to the huge server populations is that forming instance groups  is much faster than in Vanilla. It was really useful a month ago when the game was still playable (on alliance side).
---
Get to the boat just to realize there is a group or two of horde farming players on the boat.
---
I'd play classic+. Not retail tho.
---
I'd rate it approximately 5/7
---
Yes I'm well aware, in fact you can get 4 kills on a target being losing honor. That doesn't mean corpsecamping that guy 3 times is fun..
---
I don't read them as I pick them up, I generally read all my quests on the path to the thing I need.
---
This blows my mind how people farm this for days. You’re a hunter, run DM:N and buy the sinew off the AH. Way less farming
---
Let's face it.  It's the players that determine wether this game can be fun or not.  Everyone is so gung-ho about getting to 60 ASAP and then killing people below them.  It comes as no suprise to me that a RP server (which I almost joined instead of basic pvp) is filled with people not roleplaying.  It's been 15 years and I think the new generation of players are all about the destination and not the adventure while the older players like myself are apathetic as fuck to do anything about it.
---
He has an advantage that turns into more gold earned. How fucking stupid are you? It's buying power with money, if that power is rank14 or extra gold because you have alts doesn't matter.
---
Wow, you've gotten lucky with crystals....
---
Had this happen, but opposite faction - Allies holding the choke point at the bridge. Happen to get through? The group just outside DM will surely take care of that. It sucks, but is done by both factions.
---
Exactly, what I'm on about. Now we are 2, when is it gonna be worth it for blizzard to start considering? ;)
---
Comix gives a Godzilla roar when I use my battle Shout.  Not sure about recieving the buff though
---
Who cares? Just mail your bank alt arrows and have them do ‘return to sender’. All the arrows you ever need in every single mailbox
---
Leave the guild
---
This right here. PvP servers attract sociopaths and insecure types that want to show off how tough and “badass” they are in a computer game. Obviously these people do not make for the most pleasant companions in group content. I play on a PvE server for this reason, and can’t think of a single “bad community” experience.
---
Anyone can do it, what does that have to do with streamers?
---
No. There’s a difference between what he was doing and what they’ve done, if you’ve come this far down the thread and haven’t realised that then you either just dislike Asmon so much that you can’t think objectively about this or you’ve just not read anything beyond the title.
---
How about no.
---
Once BG's release alliance will quiet down about the game being unplayable
---
The new update made spy almost useless. It went from have a 200 yard range to now 20 yard range.
---
Did you quit?
---
Rule of thumb for my own disenchanting is if it’s over level 40 and vendors for less than a gold I DE it. Sometimes you roll low, sometimes you get lucky and get multiple essences. All in all you can easily acquire the mats needed for your own enchants
---
I understand that the people getting owned have it way worse yes. You have all my empathy. But thanks for understanding.
---
This is the problem. Why would you want to go forward with a museum piece frozen in time??? Why can't you accept it for what it is? Who the hell cares how fast people clear content??
---
good 2h vs bad 2h on arms or ret is still a useless amount of dps being carried regardless of weapon.  Our ret is working on being able to craft nightfall ASAP (when it's available) and we're trying to get him to 8/8 T1 asap while not stiffing the other pallys so he'll actually benefit the raid in other ways besides dmg.  Arms warriors are literally useless.  All they can do is auto attack, hit hamstring, and hit the occasional heroic strike.  They can't use rend, they can't use mortal strike, and they rarely have enough rage to do anything.  When you're a pvp guild raiding to clear the raids efficiently, but more importantly gear people for pvp, it's important to keep ALL the pvpers happy as /u/l453rl453r  says, and if you give prio on 2h's to arms/ret, then the raid turns into EVERYONE going arms/ret as /u/Taelonius  says which gets you nowhere.  Either that or it turns into "no you can't go arms/ret" and "well why can THEY go arms/ret just b/c they asked first....think I'll just stop raiding"...etc.  Vanilla loot is as much politics as it is numbers, and it always has been....you don't piss off 7 people to keep 3 memespec people happy.
---
Fortunately in our case, most of the warriors that have decided to TRY 2h in raids are quickly realizing how boring it is and swapping to proper dw fury, so the situation is resolving itself anyway.
---
Appreciate the advice. I decided to restart it, I just have to find a guild haha!
---
Shit and I’m here thinkin sulf ingots were a 100%. We’ve only killed Golemagg twice, and gotta both times. Fuck me I guess for sellin em.
---
They seems to be enjoying their time surround the camp and following us for 45 min.
---
No idea, I'd say prolly just not allow it for those classes I suppose. Unfortunate consequence I guess.
---
You can definitely get a PvP title, might not be the one you want though.
---
I go to Stormwind as a rogue and kill a guard or 2 to have an open area
---
Tldr, someone rolled faerlina
---
I was there last night and we managed to kill about a dozen, then we immediately had to run out due to a 20 man pvp raid retaking it.
---
If horde gets into BRM, it is retaken within 5-10 min at most. Guilds like Cadia and Bluntman's guild are there constantly.
---
The first three are good (Reck not as much if your guild also stacks Annihilator because I think bosses in classic have fairly low armor), Weakness is a no no. Flat reduction from Weakness does little to bosses, it's best used on fast hitting targets (like hunters' cat pets). Just let best geared SM/Ruin warlock use Agony.
---
Went out and bought a laptop just so i could play when it came out. I feel the exact same excitment when i log on. Never thought i would get to play my favourite game like this again.
---
This is awesome. I love multi rogue gank squads.
---
Idk who "they" are but I certainly don't enjoy it, and many of my horde brothers agree. We are just doing it to get optimal honor per hour.
---
This is PVE. PvP implies some risk, there is no risk for those running around in full raid groups killing level 50s. Or the 3 rogues triple ambushing casters with perd.
---
Or walking 30 ft from a corpse so you can init the moment they res trying to get to brm.
---
If you can’t simultaneously move and hit the print screen button then you may need to seek help
---
Damn these names are top tier. Lilpumpx...
---
Please dont. Grob is wildly overcrowded and it isnt 50 50.
---
I am not even in US
---
Yes dagger rogues should have priority.
---
I should have said I'm a sp!
---
Perhaps accidentally posting  here is a sign you should play classic over retail. Unless you have leveled literally every class to 60 in vanilla already.
---
Seeing as you have an active sub, all you need to do is install and you're gtg.
---
I got killed 7 times running into DM as a Horde yesterday. Ashbringer-EU
---
What's buggy about it? I got 4 different gear sets that I swap between, and no issues. Is there some other function I am not using which is buggy?
---
I picked up the game because I figured I never tried wow before. I did not research anything because I like playing games and discovering content on my own. I like discovering the alternative reality these games create. I saw PVP and was interested having played some pvp in EverQuest 15+ years ago. I did not expect to not be able to play, fly, quest, farm, mine, grind, or do anything of any subsequence, but I've got it figured out now. Level 60 and always run or fly with a full group. Most of my time now is spent helping lowbies leveling/questing or raiding because anything else is impossible.
---
With a bit of math you can calculate the DE value yourself. Exactly what you end up getting is rng, but afaik Enchantrix has the right odds. Price of dust \* amount of dust \* chance of dust + price of essence \* amount of essence \* chance of essence + price of shard \* amount of shard \* chance of shard.
---
Yes i did. I still got sub time but i feel the dread of time passing by everytime i play this game alone in my room
---
Until you realize only 1 maybe 2 people per server would have exalted
---
Pretty 20/20
---
What photography principles did u use besides a horizontal horizon/object?
---
&gt; That's correct, but I don't see any problem in here. It's just like logs.
---
Which is also not representative of player counts because they're too biased (selection bias), it's basically anecdotal. The only slightly representative data is random screenshots that people post of their main town at the busiest moments. Those are far busier than the ones that used to exist. And of course even that is purely anecdotal.
---
I think those estimates are correct from what I'm seeing. You think not. That's about all we can conclude here.
---
*(edit) The automatic sensus mods that tracked people as they played and uploaded that without further input no longer work. The manual upload ones have a dramatically lower sample size. Can't be trusted.
---
Wow....
---
"is this good?"
---
"its not good"
---
"I DONT CARE IF ITS GOOD"
---
Idd. Confusing stuff.
---
Realm yes, faction no. Not until at least TBC or wotlk (when it was first released I think?) Because of the limitations of only one faction per PvP server in classic
---
Nope. TBC please. Best era of wow.
---
Hahahaha no its not
---
Ambient sound, I believe.
---
They also keep saying "PvP happened on a PvP server?!" Without realizing that this is essentially a scripted encounter. Kill player A, move 30 yards from his corpse towards BRM, stealth and wait for res. Kill player A, rinse and repeat.
---
That's PVE
---
That's why I want kids. I need a personal healer.
---
And at least on Horde side there is the Warsong Sash which is very easy to get from an Ashenvale quest reward at level 25 or so.
---
Abusing save spots to avoid guard aggro is against ToS btw. so if you see someone doing this, report them.
---
Dont play on a pvp server if you cant deal w pvp. Fucking cry babies.
---
We’ve seen 2 perds, 1 brutality blade and no viskags :(. My sword rogue is very sad
---
It won't be horde going to PvP or ally going to PvE. It'll be the same thing that's been happening in retail for years and years, where you have servers become ally servers or horde servers. However in this case it'll probably worsen for people switching to horde as we already know they'll have the superior racials in the future expansions
---
Make a custom 4:3 resolution in your nvidia driver, check the box that says "no scaling" - done.
---
Every skill point past 300 reduces the chance of failure when trying to pick high level herbs that are "orange", as a tauren I get a base +15, add on top of that the herbalist gloves which are +5 with an additional +5 enchant I reach 325 which is where even Black Lotus is a guaranteed pick.
---
Most guilds I kmlw meet SW and go to the South entrance for MC.
---
OOOO gotcha. Well as a lock I &lt;3 you for the shadow weaving. Hands off my drops though! ;D
---
Seriously though, it'll come with time.
---
It's one way forward. Certainly not the only way.
---
Its a choice, with upsides and downsides, that all players make.
---
Noone is forcing you to play this game. 
---
There are still areas on PvE servers where rankers go to rank. You can find the flagged players if you want. But its not nearly as fun or dynamic as what you get on a PvP server, with different sized groups in different zones.
---
I can have fun just pvping solo and mining in ungoro, I can get a small sized group and fight in felwood against similar sized groups, I can get a 10-20 man and go around burning steppes and winterspring. 
---
Sure, sometimes you just get rolled over by a larger group, but thats just the way it goes. You take a smaller group and you get better honor though. More satisfying to win in small groups. 
---
And yea, the faction imbalance sucks, but that is still totally vanilla-like. Thats the way it always was.  And its not this insurmountable thing that makes it impossible to play the game.
---
You can avoid pvp to some extent on a pvp server. You can use Invis Pot, Cloaking Device, and other consumes/cds to avoid getting caught out to dry by pvp groups.
---
Yeah I've never heard of ragnaros having some sort of proximity-based threat thing apart from either you're in melee or you're not. And if that WAS the case, then as you say, your melee wouldn't be getting killed.
---
Try an hour and a half. Rattlegore. If you log on any time after 3p server time when all the hordelings get out of middle school, you're guaranteed no less than an hour and fifteen minutes of corpse walking to BRD. I've just been out grinding ogres and dragons in deadwind pass. Only quiet place to grind I've found in all azeroth.
---
I do it strictly for the naming rules.
---
Not all servers are Horde favoured “bra”. In fact there is no reliable source for those numbers people keep throwing around “8:1 Horde ratio” 
---
Ahsbringer-EU is meant to be 50/50 but it seems to be ally favoured and they do the same shit. Died 7 times on my way into DM yesterday
---
How about DMN, DMW, DME and just DM?
---
This isn't a museum, this is the chance to make the right decision instead of BC, which was good, but the wrong way
---
The perfect score.
---
Anecdotally, I find the exact opposite to be true.
---
I think the launch server issues really brought a bunch of people who care nothing about rp to grobb. In my experience it hasn’t really been bad but there are a lot of people with the go to retail macro on the horde
---
We didn’t have coordinated groups exterminating players in leveling zones.
---
My level 60 friends would come help me level and get gear from dungeons. When I hit 60 I did city raids and bgs when those came out.
---
There was also way less people at launch, so you could actually do quests and not get mobbed by no lifers who somehow got to level 40 in the first 3 days.
---
I feel I have the right balance of RP, PvP &amp; PvE (you don’t get much PvE without skirmishes - while I joined a PvP server for a reason - I know others would like a little less war).
---
Hopefully things settled down enough for you to find the right balance. Personally, I’m having a lot of fun even though I’m not levelling very fast at all, and PvP plays a big part in distracting from levelling.
---
It's quite often the case that disenchanting sells for more (keep in mind that there is more variance though). That's one reason to have a bank alt with enchanting profession.
---
We have seen 1 mageblade in 13 runs. It is not an abundant item, so weapon has a 20-25% drop rate. This is a flat out lie
---
The head is basically the only good drop for ferals cause it gives kitty bis neck. The other neck is kinda good for bear, but the one from the doggie in MC is better
---
I am not saying it's balanced, I am saying it's expected for classic population. People who find it unplayable aren't meant for classic or classic isn't meant for them: whatever but they will feel themselves better on retail. Complaining about this kind of ratio is something like complaining about warrior AOE threat issues, lack of death knights or flying mounts.
---
Server sizes: could you please elaborate?
---
LITERAL GOD
---
Not everyone is blazing through content. Also, mc and ony are extremely easy. It’ll slow down as more content comes out. People won’t get through bwl nearly as fast if they don’t know the strats. Assuming they get past razorgore and vael they have to get past the suppression room.
---
Grob has got to be one of the most cancerous servers I've had the liberty of ever playing on, and that includes some of the worst Pservers...
---
Are [Dawnbringer Shoulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12625/dawnbringer-shoulders) available yet? If not, when (if ever) will they be?
---
From my experience:
---
the slot keybind system is bugged and resets randomly
---
queuing item slot transfers for when you go out of combat doesn't work.
---
Sometimes item set swapping doesn't work
---
Some annoying glitch where itemrack constantly wants to switch to an item no matter what you do and you have to delete your WTF data to fix it.
---
Automatic gear swap on things like mounting is buggy/doesn't work.
---
Still a great addon, I'm just spoiled with the flawless pserver version :D
---
And investing time and setting up the infrastructure of it and then send his main to get it. So no it is not like paying a farming bot, this actually takes work and constant attention to work right. Work smarter not harder.
---
&gt;what evidence do you have that Advertise streams sniped?
---
He literally accidentally left Asmon's stream sound on during one of his own streams, which objectively proves to even the most tin foiled brown nosers like you that he's a stream sniper.
---
http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/sulfuras/50
---
Yep, sure is!
---
Nice elvui setup, is there an export so I can try it out?
---
What are you smoking that makes you think Actiblizz actually cares? Classic players are clearly unimportant, their shitty cloud servers prove it.
---
You are not getting Classic+, you are going to get Shadowlands.
---
A wild fairie fire appeared
---
We had our first binding drop tonight and I rolled lowest, (all our tanks were ready to become MT need be) I didn't mind losing it to the other guy but it broke my heart realizing i'll be in MC grinding for that gear until the end of Classic. If it rolls over to TBC your going to want it!
---
There is no way Blizzard are going to waste their resources on developing something new when they can just offer new TBC servers with an option to transfer your character there and start leveling to 70 or keep him on Classic server at 60 without any TBC content.
---
I can’t, that’s why I stay with king buff so only the escorted person needs to pot. But I can’t help them with the last pack.
---
I'm only kidding; consider it a jab at all the people who ignorantly propose that the current pvp situation is easily overcome by the losing side "Grouping up" or "Gitting gud." The current environment breeds pent-up frustration, and one must find their kicks where they may.
---
If your description of Sulfuras is accurate, it's definitely an outlier; on most servers, the alliance are so used to being immediately outnumbered by the ambient horde population that organized groups simply aren't worth the time. I'll admit to being a bit jealous that your server has more people interested in an ongoing PvP presence.
---
He gets hit and eats that crazy dot that does like 5k dmg
---
Did you ever fly as alliance to Thorium point? There will litrlerally be conentric rings of horde killing you each time when you ress.
---
It took me 4 corpse runs to just HS out when I missclicked and went there by mistake.
---
Yeah I tried that...3 horde were camping FP. Then 4 more were camping ramp down from FP. Then a bunch were camping entrance. To top it all off, we gave up and my buddy just accepted rez sickness and they instakilled him there. This was just last night. Shit is actually unplayable.
---
DI (Divine Intervention) is a Level 30 Paladin spell which is a great form of wipe control but is WILDLY underutilized.
---
It sacrifices the paladins life, killing them immediately, to remove another party member from harms way. This protects them with an impenetrable bubble for 3 minutes, and removes them from combat.
---
They cannot attack, heal, or move while it’s on them.
---
It’s great when you realize it’s a wipe, you toss DI up on a healer (in a good position to Rez), and bam, you have wipe control.
---
If you use it on somebody with a SS on them they also STILL have the SS to use afterwards, so it’s a great way to double up on that/save the SS.
---
I almost NEVER see another paladin do it unless instructed to. Most of the time they don’t even have the reagents for it. It takes symbol of divinity, a cheap reagent, and plenty of them don’t even know how it works.
---
Theyre not gunna make classic plus as much as that would be fucking amazing. Itd be way easierfor them to release BC and theyd just keep making money. But the expansion is worth less time than all of classic wows roll out so i wonder how thatd work
---
I'm guessing you got the numbers reversed? 
---
But reason why the alliance wouldn't want to be on the horde dominated server: you can't do anything on the server exactly as it is now, except BG. Great if that's your only goal in life. Otherwise, not so much. But it is a massive improvement over not being able to do anything AND no BGs, I'll give you that!
---
On the horde side, it's still basically a PvE server but without BGs due to queues. At least you get to play the rest of the game.
---
Fortunately for al of us, the community seems to be shifting away from spy.
---
I guess I just wasn't that active online back then
---
Gross.
---
Blue name implies pvp ain’t turned on, which it should be in ZF, if it’s a pvp-server. Won’t be happening.
---
I really hope I get the second binding pre-BWL because I’m not sure how I’ll fit a second raid night into my life.
---
&gt;- The Add Tank Pop's Shield Wall when Garr is at 50% (no idea tho why I just hear it on Discord). 
---
The adds all blow up when Garr hits 50% regardless of HP. This is why Warlock banishes are also so important below 50%, because the adds can randomly blow up if they fall out.
---
I won't be so sure about that. I expect heavy BG queues for the Horde and it's kinda obvious what do you do when you are in queue: you go out and gank.
---
But what is the MS &amp; OS then referring to? I can't see how it could refer to main and off spec while ignoring that my main spec is daggers, while another rogue's MAIN spec is swords. Sure they can switch later on, but what's the point of main/offspec then?
---
What's that addon on the left that shows goals?
---
Alliance on smolderweb are a bunch of cowards who run away when they see horde ganking other alliance. If you are alliance on smolderweb and you actually want to engage in world pvp message me, we'll get you in the guild.
---
Ya these look awesome lol. Curious about the principles if you care to share :)
---
The last time I saw this guy, we both sat down for drinks. Not 2 minutes later, 2 rogues and a druid show up.
---
You dont need evidence these days lol what world are you living in?
---
Was not aware that you can (should be able to) config gear swaps for when exiting combat or mounting. I should check those out, apparently too complacent to explore it further than for it to cover my immediate needs!
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Yes, this is exactly like it was in vanilla.
---
Just the data base alone makes spy worth it. The rest is gravy. 
---
Spy and bg spy will really shine in the days to come, once flag running exploits are a thing
---
Keyboard on my lap, mouse on the bed
---
thats what happens when all you do is deathball, you dont know how to really pvp. BGs are gonna be so good.
---
We also spam rank 1 heals for a crit from shamans and priests to get the extra from talents.  Ancestral healing + inspiration + greater stoneshield = insane amounts of mitigation.
---
Get off your high horse. Work with your group not against it fool
---
Why would I want to
---
You should’ve known rolling alliance was rolling hard mode. Honestly. Game has been out for 15 years and everyone knows the game is hugely skewed in PvP due to massive racial disadvantage and boats vs zeps (and PS skewed the other way in PVE due to blessing of salvation and cleanse).  If you roll alliance it’s because you want a challenge in PVP.
---
Stay in ZF (pref GY melee cleaves) until 52, then go to BRD and either do a few Ring of Law runs, the XP is shit but there's a few gear upgrades. For XP either do loops of the prison section or get a group to farm Gor'Shak quest spawns. I dunno what the alliance equivalent of that is but I assume there is one.
---
&gt;Can I get my guild mate to trade me the summoning crystal for Mara? Or is it not tradeabel?
---
No you need your own staff, you can definitely tank the run yourself. Pick up the quest and go in through the orange entrance, make sure to loot the water elemental (part one), clear to the water fall, jump down (once) to avoid the hard packs and then clear up and across to the other side of the falls. You'll be in the end of Purple, so just clear in a bit and the boss for the other part of the staff will be on your left. Then backtrack and go down the falls to the boss/NPC that makes you your own staff.
---
It helps if you've got someone along whose familiar with it, but it's not overly complicated or slow.
---
Lmfao my mom would destroy me if she saw me doing this already knowing how much wow i play 😭
---
&gt; All he is asking for is a Change so People stop leaving the game.
---
Exactly. Which was the whole point of my post. Since you said the following;
---
&gt;He is simply talking about a guildie leaving. He never once complained about the Situation himself I think.
---
&gt;All he is bothered about is that People are leaving. No reason to be so salty xD
---
So is he "just venting" or asking for a change? Make up your damn mind.
---
I’ve done about 40 angerforge runs for hand of justice and I’ve never seen it drop yet. RNG is a real hooker sometimes!
---
If only it was the holy pally Yeet, then it would've been perfect
---
I wonder how do the overpopulated faction feels when they see 1 solo guy every 10min or so. Because on the other side we just feel bad for them. They seem to be so hungry for killing
---
Good we are talking about a very specific instance where the lock wanted all the aggro as he was tanking
---
the phase doesn't really matter. I would go for aoe spec but it depends a lot on how active your server is. I think aoe is no matter what better than single target though, but if your server is high popped you might want to go something of a mix
---
\*logs out\*
---
Ahhh it's good being an adult and not some immature kid like these horde. Can just walk away and live life finding something else to do while the kids waste their time camping honorless corpses.
---
by that logic asmon should be banned too, his community is horrendous and he regularly breaks TOS. People aren't upset that advertise got banned, if he doesn't follow TOS then twitch is in the right to suspend him. They are upset at the double standard where popular people are allowed to be toxic and everyone else just has to deal with it. asmon and esfand are just the worst yet nothing ever happens to them.
---
Best level for enchanting is 1 to de things
---
I leveled mine for smoking heart (overrated trinket btw. Most of the time I use the mark of Tyranny/ chosen and will use DFT next phase)
---
Going to drop it for engineering master prof
---
Nice!
---
Also I don't feel like going through shards that fast. VW ftw
---
That's good to hear. Just want to make sure I'm not totally useless but it sounds like I'll be able to do pretty decent damage.
---
From my experience if I open with cheap shot, slice and dice macro, by the time I have enough energy to SS the gcd is already reset. But if I ambush and go straight to SS without slice and dice the gcd doesn't reset yet.
---
That's where I'm at. I was out of the country for a month, was only level 50 when I left and phase 2 had dropped by the time I came back. Hell I even played horde on a relatively balanced server, but even then it sounds like I'll be ganked quite often from everything I've read.
---
 I might come back once BGs drop but maybe not. I enjoyed my time in classic but even before I left I realized that this game requires a *massive* time commitment and I'm just not sure if I want to give the game that commitment at this stage in my life. It was fun but not *that* fun, at least not for me.
---
The game is kinda racist towards this strong female orc warrior.
---
No but i have a fair deal of issues due to eye fatigue (office work)
---
Instant 60, 2x blizzlike, 5x blizzlike vanilla pserver player here, Grobbulus really not that bad. The use of emotes by the opposite factions is increased. I am an Alliance warrior/rogue here who rolls with guildies often so ymmv
---
No such flight point exists. There is only a trap which you can fly to and get instakilled at
---
There's one server that's ridiculously alliance over populated in NA, and there's absolutely no horde incentive to balance it out. It's more extreme as an example, but for alliance it's better for them to keep joining balanced servers than try to help beleaguered alliance on dominated servers because they'll always have short queues no matter where they go (eh, tbf kinda true no matter what server they join when you think about it).  
---
And you're right, being dominated in this game sucks balls. Not like people joining those servers for BGs really helped anyway, they spend all their time in an instance not out in the world helping fight.
---
Yeah, nowhere close to the bridge bottleneck.
---
It's what happens when their idols are screechy streamer morons like asmon who think they are better than those around them and thus ninja shit or rage at the game like children. 
---
Fuck twitch fuck most streamers.
---
That usually implies that you do multiple duels back to back, since SP has no cooldowns to worry about. In a single 1v1 a rogue should still kill you with no chance to respond, unless you're a dwarf or resist a stun. A mage with two iceblocks stands a good chance, and SL warlocks are tough. And resto druids ofc, if that even counts.
---
I've seen a bunch already
---
You can easily do all the bosses during a jumprun though, you just skip all the trash, the only thing you will skip is doing the keyquest with the imp. 
---
I can understand the frustration if you wanna do quest run for other dungeons and noone is willing to do them but imo one of the real strengths of vanilla over retail is the dungeons design is not totally linear with no options to skip bosses or take them in the order you prefer instead of the on-rails experience of most retail dungeons.
---
I get your point, but you can enter scholo without a key by jumping off the roof repeatedly until you die.
---
‘I was having the exact same thoughts you are’ or ‘I was in the exact same place you are’,  but I think your opener missed the mark :D
---
Yup. No life elitists have ruined the game. Big surprise.
---
Retail is probably a better experience now. This is nothing like my 2004-2009 experience with WoW.
---
It is viable. But since you are have SM (30 points in affli), it's worth to invest to Dark Pact for leveling and go 31 affli. Because you get Ruin as last talent on 60 anyway. I would suggest going up to Dark Pact for comfy leveling and switch to Ruin once you hit 60.
---
What totems should I be using as a lvl 25 Enhancement Shaman.
---
I'm levelling with a Balance Druid friend so I use a 2h axe with Rockbiter Weapon and Earth Shock to hold aggro but I assume this is a no no in a dungeon?  In this case I switched it out for Flametongue Weapon and Flameshock instead - is this correct?
---
Also should I be using my shocks on cooldown or should I cast them once and then auto-attack?
---
Damn dude nice job. Im trying for it too but Its so hard for me, i can only play at peak times and every furblog village is a gank fest or always being farmed by 10 people. Plus im revered so theres no point in grouping with anyone cuz all i need is beads.
---
I only need 6% hit as an orc warrior with an axe - for 2h axe and dual wielding axes? And really only for mobs 61+? Or does it affect other mobs too.
---
I've been raiding MC for about 7 weeks and I am yet to acquire my first item.
---
We've had no bindings, two hand of rags...
---
Cool, good thing that I'm not arguing at all that warriors are have abilities that generate more threat. I was arguing that the way dots do damage mean that any lapse in aggro of the tank will instantly be exagerated by the dots constantly doing damage. If a mage sees that they are about to take aggro they can stop casting and let the tank get a few hc/sunders in. Locks with dots on the target cant. But I'm guessing you only play one class...
---
That isn't a yes or no question
---
Then what's the solution? How do you fix the imbalance? 
---
If you don't, the people who CAN'T play because of the excessive ganking are going to quit. Then the servers become even more imbalanced. Then the game dies.
---
Other than faction queues, what's a good solution?
---
After p2 release Onyxia buff's duration has diminished to 5 minutes on alliance
---
Join a casual raiding guild. Progress with them, be super nice and help out more than the Ret pallys. Get the first eye. Get hand of sulfras built, literally 2 shot any clothie. 
---
We’re still waiting to find our nice ret pally. They’re all just rettards atm
---
I a absolutely agree 100% it's part of why it's so great, that said ofc you are a horde rogue 🤣 undead?
---
I'm really not sure about the Saber grind, since I don't play Alliance. I'm pretty sure I've seen some ally riding it though? Could be wrong. 
---
The timbermaw grind takes a very long time, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you wanna flex an epic trinket which isn't all that great imo.
---
Nasty.
---
I wonder what % of RP servers roll Druid
---
if i delete the scepter of celebras can I remake it by talking to that dude or did I fuck myself out of warlock gold farm ~15 levels ago
---
Thank you for the offer, but I am not really interested.
---
Lul.
---
Go to retail
---
2 Hand of Rag, 0 Staff of Dom... Handful of Mageblades
---
Can deny I'm 26 and grew up playing.
---
Huh so could you not go fairly high as a lvl 59 BG think?
---
The second one is by far the most annoying thing to me in classic. I sweard some of these f\*cks chase me through half of the zone before they finally decide to go back.
---
You're right. The 3:1 H:A ratio on Fairbanks is definitely OPs fault.
---
I roll RPVP because the world is more active. Unlike other servers RP servers have people who use the world.
---
Help the son kill the elite pack when you’re walking down the road. When you get to the boss at the tower, stand in range so he kills you. Used to be you could stand back and not aggro him, but if you do that now Tirion won’t spawn. The boss will kill the son after killing you then Tirion will spawn and kill them all. Stay dead until you get the quest complete message and then pop, corpse run, and turn it in. I did it exactly like this and it worked.
---
Settle for being the operative part. I hate that that’s all we have in us, all that’s available.
---
I do. 14/32/5 is with natural shapeshifter 3/3.
---
I think spy will be out of use for the most part when BGs come around. At that points, only the no lifers and neckbeards will still feel the need to embrace its then current form or another addon to help them be more than mediocre.
---
I am sorry, if I come off rude, but your guildie is as stupid as it gets. Who tries the same thing over and over again knowing he will fail? Even a dog learns after some bad tries. He could take the boat to the nightelves and fly from there. When dying in theramore he could spirit rezz. Heck, if he asked some experienced player for advice,  like a normal human would do, he would know to swim next to the boat before leaving the port and "attach" to it in the water without being bothered when transferring. Be happy he left the game, it is obviously too much for his simple mind.
---
And even if the item drops, no guarantee someone else in the raid won't get/win it. That's the nature of raiding. In retail I'm still farming Firelands for both mounts.
---
I would but don't have engi for seaforium charges lol, any other way
---
Hey that's my server!
---
I’ve seen different numbers and the latest I’ve seen is around 60-40 in favour of horde - but alliance is doing a great job moving their groups around the world and always seem to be more coordinated and grouped up. Horde has gone into 2-3man groups and are literally watching you die before engaging the enemy to not share any of the honor.
---
Had some great fun after the first few days of total zerg fest were over :)
---
Not sure what the other guy is talking about, at the very least that's not what I was told +1 systems are.
---
You roll MS&gt;OS and you get plus one item you "reserve". If your reserved item drops, you get it. If multiple people reserve the same item, you all roll off against each other.
---
It encourages people to spread their reserved item around, and gives everyone a bit of feeling they have control over their ability to get loot. It also addresses the problem in DKP systems where no one will roll on minor bis items because they're saving for big bis upgrades in the weapons (mage blade, bonereavers edge, etc).
---
In my guild we're talking about it, and kind of thinking people can reserve an item but everyone gets to roll on the big rare ones just so not everyone tries to reserve that and make the system pointless.
---
You have mail!
---
Proly works same way as fishing bots - afaik they scan selected screen region for pixel color change(in case of fishing that's the splash).
---
That's because deadmines came before dire maul, so deadmines as DM was already established. Also nobody runs "DM" it's either "DM:W, DM:E, or DM:N" this should never have even been a debate as there is literally no reason for one. Except for the people who want to force DM as being VC cause cata babies.
---
CC isn't really god. Paladins make up for any crappy racials on the ally side.
---
Sort of
---
The main reason for personal loot was to combat the efficacy of split runs
---
Bigglesworth!

Trying to do cave mushrooms in darkshore with that damn waterfall in the background
---
Why are you using a website instead of a spreadsheet?
---
If it was 2003 why do they go to 70 I don't get it
---
No clue for the downvotes,  but in some servers.  it is that bad.
---
&gt;The disparity of intention and result; when the result of an action is contrary to the desired or expected effect. 
---
Spell it out for me then. What result would be contrary or expected result. Less Horde playing? That's literally the the end result we're looking for.
---
Hilarious and useless thought.
---
Crusader is the gift that keeps on giving. After that it's 7 agi on gloves, minor speed, riding skill and 9 stre on bracers. That's basically 95% of the enchants that I do. 
---
+4 Stats is a white whale, haven't seen it a single time on the AH.
---
15agi will be the big moneymaker in phase 3 but might want to wait with farming that rep til BGs come out.
---
I played Aion too! Awesome, beautiful game with a really cool story. The downside was it was a Korean grind MMO with that terrible RNG-upon-RNG system for upgrading gear. I played it as long as I could but eventually the grind wore down the beauty and fun.
---
They spoke out loud that it was to remove a situation Where „trial” raiders would be stripped of loot or raiders having to trade upgrades because the guild told them to. They could have just quit the guild.
---
Grobbulus is one of the best servers, bar none. We still get small queues (200-500) during peak hours, never have problems getting enough guildies to help me in the open world when we need to trek to BRM. It truly feels like a tug of war and RP can be found in the inns and towns in the most unexpected of places. 
---
I've been on one of the smaller rp-pvp sleepy servers during retail (Silver Hand), and I disliked how long it took to find groups for anything.
---
Bro, you play horde. Just stfu and enjoy the ez-mode.
---
You mentioned pops were even overall between alliance:horde according to census data, why dont you link your source bub?
---
Rule of thirds!
---
not the OP.
---
its for the same reason ppl said to roll on pvp servers for the "classic experience" 
---
except he is now taking joy at all those people crying for various reasons
---
Good thing there are 39 others. I’m lovin the free loot. Just raping people in pvp. You all have fun fighting computers.
---
I had the opposite problem.
---
I was trying to farm elementals in felwood for elemental fire to make fpps for raid. Now I am a fury warrior. Let's just say it was 1.5 drop an hour aka 8g/hour since they are 5g on ah. Either nobody to help me pvp or too many people to farm efficiently.
---
Just bought it off ah and went to level my rogue
---
I agree with the sentiment that C+ is where wow needs to go if it isn't just burning the candle until we hit cataclysm. But MMO players are just too good at discovering mechanics/delving databases/sharing information these days. They will always burn through the content faster than it can be made.
---
This is actually something WoW has been struggling with for years now.
---
We have about 10 total clears of current raid content at this point, I have 1 (one) piece of gear for my Warrior.
---
That’s just the way it is, you’ll be looking from the sidelines for months on end as the entire raid gets full sets &amp; assorted items while you are still waiting for a mere handful of drops, that if even they drop, you are now competing with every other DPS warrior / rogue to get.
---
Learn to live with it, or re-roll Hunter/Druid, you’ll be fully geared in a few weeks.
---
Not true at all since off targets often don't need to be touched so all your doing is padding meters to look good but not actually playing good
---
So, the RP goes on over voice chat? My only experience with RP was when I made a blood elf waaay back in 2008. A few 70s were in the tavern having some kind of meeting between two "families" of elves, but they carried everything out in  /say and  /em.
---
Theres an alliance mage who leveled (on a separate account) a horde rogue to 60 just to protect his farm spot from any other alliance players (on a pve server). Since you must flag to aoe farm, he's got the spot on lock down unless someone else no lifes an alt to 60 like he did.
---
Have you noticed discrepancies between these two sites?
---
Started a warrior after not playing WoW since original vanilla.
---
How hard is it going to be to get a tank spot in raids?
---
I know you only need a couple tanks and any raiding guild will already have them and are not likely to change. So then maybe I could tank for the ‘alts/secondary’ raid for a guild large enough to have one. Or try to find a new guild that doesn’t have a tank yet? I’m also fine with just running fury dps in the mean time.
---
Anyway, how realistic is any of this, or will I be disappointed when I hit 60?
---
Also it sucks to have to blow 5g in consumes every PvP battle just to get on even footing.
---
I wish we had more accurate data. Both of our sources are very obviously flawed. Going off the ole' anecdotal radar, the servers are more full by several factors. I spent x hundred days played in WoW during vanilla across 3 characters on 3 servers and both factions. The game was significantly less packed then and population size is an issue. I have to trust my hundreds of days played expertise over completely flawed and inaccurate reporting. I just wish we still had accurate census data. I can only think of one reason why blizzard broke its functionality.
---
&gt;     outbid.
---
&gt; thats the issue.
---
I mean it sounds like the other players were raiding just as much as this person if they had more dkp than him. If he only saw those maces a single time, the same is true for all the other healers in his raid.
---
Ye, don't know anyone for that. And you need to fit together the schedule
---
Yeah, they’ve even got the animation of you pawing/scratching the earth to dig up the plant.
---
/u/bulletproofbra curious to your thoughts here (m8)
---
I know how you feel. I got my priest to 60 by week 3 after launch and went 6 weeks without winning any raid loot. It made my time preparing and joining raids feel useless.
---
What has worked for me is getting into a guild where you gain DKP for raiding. This way, you may be unlucky with no loot dropping one week, but you’re still gaining DKP which will help you win loot when it eventually drops. Since joining a DKP raiding guild, I’ve attained a lot more loot and still enjoy my time during raids because it always feels like I’ve gained something for my efforts.
---
Best of luck to ya!
---
You're gonna love those stupid Night Elf glow-lamps
---
Ya man my raid grp is similar, but we've had less mageblades total and a few vuskags / dbs 
---
No eyes, no bindings. Been downing rag since week 3 lmao 
---
The loot tables are mighty wonky
---
Your life must be kinda sad/boring, I'm sorry. It might get better some day!
---
Your BRE warriors should be destroying your dal rends warriors in DPS. I have OEB and no dal rends warrior even comes close to me...perhaps your BRE warrior isn’t using as many buffs or they’re raiding as arms lol.
---
It is a combination of this + them attempting to stick to a release cycle that worked *15 years ago*. It was never going to work in 2019. 15 years ago everything happened in the game organically. This is NOT an organic version of the game. They fucked up tremendously releasing honor without BGs
---
Imagine playing on a PvP server and thinking get to walk around while people are trying to rank up. Do yourself a favor and either get used to it, quit, or reroll PVE because complaining about it on reddit is gonna change literally nothing.
---
That’s why I said over the course of classic wow, obviously 1k gold is good but I’m just saying if you plan on playing until the end the recipe is better to learn and use
---
Many fell in the face of chaos. But not this one. Not today.
---
&gt;I can only think of one reason why blizzard broke its functionality
---
To deal with ClassicLFG addon.
---
It still does the accurate /who reporting you bind and spam.
---
It's either humor or flathead logic.
---
ok cool thanks! can i ask how much you charge for services?
---
yes, as I druid I find it quite painful to get into BRD. I don't want to imagine how it is for other classes though...
---
Beautiful, I love a happy ending. Thank you for the update and happy Thanksgiving!
---
Ops did I just comment on the wrong post
---
So you're telling me it's better to do less damage in the fight using more mana quicker with a spell that has no % to hit talents. Dotting off target depending on your spell power is easily 4k damage for almost the same mana as a shadow bolt which may or may not crit/get resisted.
---
How is multiplying your damage and mana efficiency not playing good?
---
Wait is that how that actually works?
---
So there is no proof?
---
Even with the pvp situation, which will mostly be resolved soon anyway, I have had SO much fun in classic. My guild rocks, I love the server community, and it's been amazing replaying my favorite game of my high school years.
---
Not advertised lol? There have been multiple private servers in the past 6 years that were the closest thing you were going to get to Classic. Nobody is saying you needed to play on them but if you just took 5 mins to figure out what happens when guilds are ranking up you would’ve known. Your own fucking fault.
---
Loved BC quests/lore/raids but the HATED the gear... EVERYTHING is huge and shinny purple/orange/pink colored!!
---
I simply asked a gm to change my name and it was no problem
---
Hahaha my fellow farming buddy, didn't expect to see you here :D
---
We have so many guild dedicated to RP. We run with 1 of them to MC every week. Clan Battlehammer, Crimson Dawn, Clan Hammersong, Dwarven Overlords all strictly RP guilds.
---
So what?
---
We got a mage blade and an i got on our Golemagg kill on Tuesday and my DKP was too low to even *think* about that blade :T
---
I don’t agree so it can’t be objective
---
I’m just terrified that this may legitimately ruin the game. I’m on Skeram Alliance, and I’ve noticed the player base drop like crazy. None of my auctions sell, LFG channel is dead, trade and general chat dead, and bumping into Alliance in the world is becoming a rarity. I’m afraid a lot of people just said fuck it and quit the game altogether. Most of my friends haven’t played in a week or so and I’m afraid they’re done as well
---
So he didn’t just spirit Rez? He waited 30 actual minutes instead of waiting 10? He sounds kind of stupid to me. Glad he’s not using bandwidth that people with a brain cell could use to play the game
---
It drops or it dont. Sulf ingot def is way lower drop rate then 33%
---
That was very annoying to watch. Added you to my kos list.
---
It's not an example of anything, doesn't demonstrate or show anything, it's deceptive..?
---
That Whump guy does seem pretty greedy...
---
Warriors can use daggers so if the Warrior intends to use it as his weapon then its fair.
---
Will check it out, thanks.
---
Who cares xD?
---
&gt; EDIT: Judging by the responses this is EXACTLY the attitude I mean. This insane exclusionary force that tries to invalidate any and all criticisms of their holy Classic, hallowed be thy name.
---
I don't even see any replies here that are insanely defending Classic. I've had no bad experiences with people in game. I'm on a smaller RPPVE server though, so that may be your problem.
---
Same thing with Draenei. Big blue whateverthefucks.
---
Wait until bgs... you won’t even get to move...
---
Mage portals are less than 1g
---
That's true, but it's not useless. It says much about that particular population, and based on that you can also get *some* idea about the rest of the population (but you should be careful with that).
---
For a Warrior DPS - Main spec would count as DPS gear, and off spec would be tanking gear, or potentially PVP gear.
---
Lmao neither of these are true. Access to paladins is far superior to anything racials might give you.
---
But its your only option when your faction acts like this everywhere so you've forced the other to raid log, quit, or level alts.
---
Yeah it just shows how far into the pockets of these large streamers twitch is
---
They dgaf they just want their money, even if it means suspending someone for doing nothing wrong other than showing how bad asmon is to his thousands of dickriders
---
You cant exactly force players to RP. You want them to set up a bot that bans people who use "non-RP" speech?
---
You can always get out of her basement
---
Our healers were loaded on dkp and when a peice dropped they were a bunch of pirana it was nuts whole raid group was cracking up at how much dkp was spent on one item. Its like a mage blade dropped.
---
Kinda, as a fury war I haven't got a peace of gear from MC or ONY since hitting 60 a month and a half ago. Feels a bit disheartening.
---
He is right, there was no spell dmg or healing back then
---
actually, no. thats not how its always been.  
---
until after cata, the wow destroyer, came out, pvping was an honor thing.   
---
group ganking just happened rarely and grp gankers had been spit on, even by their own faction.  
---
the community got worse and worse with each shitty addon and blizzard/ activ. continued to disrupt the social aspect of the game, making it more and more into an action adventure solo game.  
---
if i think back to the early times, i cant really remember more than 5 shitty people ive played with.  
---
starting with cata? TONS of egotistical, narcissistic hipster-nerd asshats.

People may break up the instance into chunks though.  99% of groups skip baelgar for example.
---
Every PvE server was stuffed to the brim for days at launch.
---
Nice! What addon are you using that provides detailed character stats? (hit %, crit %, etc.)
---
Or it could drop back to back
---
Blizzard is working on Burning Crusade so that will be next.
---
CD timers. DansGame
---
Honestly how can you expect people to want to waste their time helping you to achieve your goals in game. Find a guild who doesn't mind helping out noobs and pugging / gearing new raiders every week and you'll have what you're looking for. Let me know how boring/annoying that gets in a few weeks.
---
I understand you are upset, but you really need to calm down. All I'm saying is that not all horde players are terrible people that don't care about alliance having fun too.
---
You're taking getting ganked way too seriously. I get ganked all the time on my (rare) alliance dominant server, but I accept it's a part of the game and aim to get better however I can.
---
How much you want to bet those are hacked accounts?
---
I think we have gotten everything but predition blade, eye and bindings so far oh and the paw off magmadar :c
---
True lol
---
Streamer culture is dumb af, stream? Get stream sniped ya wanker
---
Our raid leader was super scared about rag so we cleared mc and rag separately. Warlocks had their bags full of shards, everyone was assigned a specific position to min-max the fireballs.
---
Fight starts. ... Melee go out, aoe is coming. Melee group (me included) didnt even start. Just standing there afraid to not get one shot. Good thing raid leader didnt see us cuz rag was blocking his view :P 
---
It looked like the warlocks were shoveling the shards in a locomotive steam engine cuz even with scared melees he did not even sink, we killed him that fast xd
---
Yes... LK gear looked WAY better.. Kinda too similar sometimes, but at least wasnt purple
---
This world... is a prison.
---
/unzip
---
This is like saying your skeptical of the idea of renovating a house to sell because the reason you want to sell it is to make money not spend money.
---
Didn't say it would happen, just that it should.
---
Combat ended after 9 minutes and 10 seconds.
---
This is why druid tanks are so good in 5 man's. Furor means worst case you can powershift 3 or so times on a sketch pull to get more rage,  in addition to getting 5 free rage every crit,  and having tools to get threat gen on the Los by pre hot. They mitigate a lot of the general chaos in a pug situation
---
So it takes 10 horde to kill one ally lul @Horde
---
CC is really important in smaller skirmishes or Battlegrounds, however in large zergs it's mostly about surviving the mages, which makes gnomes backed up by paladins noticeably better than anything else. In zergs, mages are the majority of your firepower, and they also initiate the fight. Getting out of that Nova is the most important thing at that point, which is something exclusive to the gnome racial. However, In smaller skirmishes, about 5v5, Orcs becomes A LOT stronger, since at that point the rogues will actually start using stun over bursting, and that's when Orcs become nutty.
---
Weapons wont swap in combat for one.
---
Nice man but damn this makes me hate hunters more like some classes just have ridiculous kits 
---
I play one of those classes so I can't complain too much
---
The dwarf guilds on grob set the bar. I have been nothing but completely impressed with how much fun it at least looks like they have...
---
Oh that sucks you get stealthers that kill flagged people. Know what alliance get? Raids of horde with 15 mages that kill all alliance when they get on the boat since it's a pvp zone. Then we get rested after zoning on boat to die again. If you're not quick you get stuck on the boat for this to happen again. Yeah great time
---
How very foolish of me to not notice that. Cheers!
---
They are the same, just narrow focus.
---
+5 to the skill means the world while levelling. It lets you start farming higher level mats 5 levels earlier. Almost downright necessary if leveling mining, right around the time you stop getting much XP from iron and aren't yet able to swing at mithril.
---
Google wowhead BRD guide and you will find what you need. In general wowhead guides are not super great, but they are a decent introduction to whatever you want to know more about.
---
He signed up for it because there were no PvE servers available for weeks.
---
Yes census data has supported that, you can look it up if your interested, you didn't provide any data either.  You honestly think it's more characters but less people playing?
---
And no not everyone was warned, you think people on the bad side of an imbalanced server were warned that transfers would fuck their server up?
---
My hunter alt who has been 60 for less than a week has rhok and 2x t2 helms. One for agi one for fire resist. We've had 8 leafs in a row and 0 eyes. 3 alts have rhok now lol
---
On grob you barely get quests done... most people are playing other characters until battlegrounds because its kind of pointless, most of the time.
---
or just take a warrior or druid who out threat spamming BOK and do dmg at the same time
---
Eshkanders? It's shit anyway 
---
We got a perd like last week I think, first one. But we never get caster or healer loot it seems.
---
Just shaman and warlock tier peices all day, sometimes some rogue peices.
---
Horde have every advantage in world PvP, questing/leveling to 60, and most servers population. Only thing we have going for alliance is we're closer to BRM which doesn't matter because it's on a 24/7 farm by horde, and a little quicker to getting to world boss which also gets negated. 
---
It's funny because the stereotype has flipped, Horde is now where all the weenies go and Alliance has turned into the hard mode way of playing the game. I wonder how constantly playing at a disadvantage is going to translate in BGs for Alliance. On one hand, there's a lot of alliance that don't even PvP at all because they know it's futile so they will probably suck, but on the other you have hardened pvpers that are so used to fighting out numbered theyve gotten scrappy, may come in and wreck when the odds are even. Who knows.
---
How long does it take the chest to despawn
---
I played on: Mal'ganis, Eredar and Mannaroth between launch and AQ40 opening during vanilla. At no point did this type of PVE occur on any of those servers. Two of which were considered top servers. 
---
People have predicted the end of the world consistently since we started keeping records, hell they probably did it before we kept records. We are still here. 
---
Please don't use a false equivalency. You don't pick up a hot log and not expect to be burned, hell unless you are super human you will get burned that is a fact not a prediction.
---
It was not like this while leveling or gearing at launch. It didn't get this way until Blizzard allowed players from the minority faction to transfer. On Herod it was bad before the PvP patch hit. It only got worse as a result, but was already awful.
---
I love PvP. But as I said, this is not PvP. This isn't even Zerg v Zerg. The scale is Universe vs State.
---
Same brother, horde warrior on Razorgore and I can't seem to go to any flight path without alliance having a team down there, yet I never arrive somewhere and the horde is doing the same. Sucks to see, especially as I was debating rolling alliance before launch!
---
You know, I think it's important to keep his memory alive, even if it's just through those videos :) I'm sure his family would be glad to know so many people enjoyed and still enjoy his work.
---
Jesus I hate The nigh elf lamps, way to loud.
---
If that's your opinion there are both PVE and retail servers open to migration, don't come into a 15 yo game and get mad when it's set up the same as 15 years ago some of us vanilla players can finally play it again and are enjoying tf out of it.
---
I went and did the testing on this. 1 month old thread but in case someone comes across this:
---
no stones, 13000 attacks = 5.53% crit  
---
double stones, 6698 attacks = 10.76% crit  
---
Stones give overall crit, double stones = 4% crit
---
Ad hominem and generalizations are literally mutually exclusive. Also, it's not me and my experiences alone I find unacceptable. It's the experience of my friends and acquaintances that are just trying to enjoy a truly great game that I find intolerable. Trying to get someone into World of Warcraft at the moment is quite insufferable due to the **choices** these *assholes* are making. I'm guessing you're either Horde side or one of these people who gank honorless targets.
---
Wow as a rogue can I be in your guild lmao? 7? That's nuuts
---
Yeh I feel you. It's a real struggle farming beads during the day without being interupted by gankers and other players. I got most of the grind done during the early hours of the morning, usually 2am-8am. If you can't manage that you could try the southern timbermaw camp in felwood. Even during peak hours it's not that contested, from my experience. But ofc, the loot won't be as good.
---
This is literally the definition of griefing. There should be bans issued for all of the creatures that do this.
---
We've had 2. Both people quit classic since.
---
Says the hordie on a horde dominated server
---
Never had an issue while soloing on my priest.  Always triggers.
---
Imp drain soul needs you to land the killing blow, not your pet.
---
Don't use TSM as a new player!
---
Auctionator is the best option for a new player.
---
Others have intrusive and excessive UI elements that are only even helpful to experienced players and people who know how the AH works
---
You will only see a raid where everyone has full bis or close to it very late into the game, and even then it basically hangs on other guilds disbanding or bis geared people leaving and getting sucked up by another guild. On Lights Hope it took me almost a year of raiding Naxx to get full bis, and i had very high loot prio.
---
It's 1g man... That's nothing
---
Do you need mining or can you do it with herb?
---
The racial difference is entirely made by Orcs, if you aren't an Orc, there's really no difference. The stun resist is more or less useless in a massive zerg where you just get rooted by mages, but in smaller skirmishes or BGs, the Orc racial is incredibly overpowered, moreso than anything else.
---
Only if I can get honor after taking somrone to 1%, dying, and having someone snipe my kill
---
On Fairbanks as Alliance I tried to get to BRM from Burning Steppes. When I landed and started to run, I would get mind-controlled and run backwards before I would get killed. This happened about 5 times and probably only advanced about 100 yards. Then I logged out. Why bother?
---
NO ONE FEELS BAD FOR YOU
---
One of the most obscure songs to find and you have absolutely nailed it, including the speed. Unbelievable!
---
I think in vanilla you generate more threat if you are closer to a target, so Ragnaros' size may be a factor in how this radius plays out?  Then again, i cant find a source, so maybe I just misremember from 14 yrs ago.
---
Too bad blizzard decided to ruin it with #changes, no longer making the alliance guards in the zone alliance flagged.
---
Zones should be this huge and there should be one world hyperserver... Then everything will make sense - portals, flying mounts, resources...
---
More like Alliance will start crying about not winning BGs
---
Says they're added in content phase 1 so you would think they're ingame already? But the pattern seems only to drop from Kazzak, Azuregos or Onyxia in the current phase.
---
Imagining Stonetalon as a geographically significant area like this really brings alive the story of the Venture Co. mining.
---
That's really quite fucked then. If the owner gives permission, it's no one else's business. Wow, someone downvoted me for just stating a fact. oof
---
Oh wow didn't know that
---
I didn't know I needed this. But now I do.
---
You should see a doctor about that
---
i dont think so because joining the dominant faction isnt that fun either, forcing to group up in a large group or raid for fuck all honor and struggling to find the other faction isnt what most people want to do.  alliance getting fucked at every town, flight path and city is also shit, but horde having to go to extreme lengths for honor isnt fun too
---
The grom’gol zeppelin is a trap more often than not. Horde don’t have it as easy as you think. We deal with the same nonsense regularly with the added bonus of getting polied until honorless target wears off
---
Grob is pretty much this. RP-PVP - with next to zero in world RP going on. It would be absolute zero if not for a few Dwarven guilds.
---
What irks me the most is the utterly terrible (gross/racist) names that I see day after day.
---
Just telling you that people on this sub were mostly telling how much fun world PvP before BG would be for months.
---
Personally I knew and tried to warn people but I was a minority and I can understand newcomers reading the sub week before release and believing the majority repeating that WoW PvP was amazing
---
Thanks for the advice. For now i will continue going solo its easier for me not having to rely on anyone and i could possibly get lucky every now and then (last sat in 2 hours got 3 arcane crystals and 2 sapphs total of 250g) so i know the money is here if rng aligns lol thanks for watching the vid!
---
Yeah because you are spamming +spell power gear while dungeon leveling right?
---
Yea, I read that post yesterday too.
---
Level 58 lock here can I start doing all the dungeons or should I stick to brd till 60?
---
Yeah other then offspec 2hs that will go to the for some reason raiding arms warrior or enhancement shaman, offspec tank gear which usually goes to offtank obviously, Quick strike which is rolled by all rogues and dps warriors enhancement and feral druids, onslaught girdle is the least contested depending how many warriors you have.
---
While Paladins might be incredibly strong, and actually tilt a teamfight in the favour of the alliance in most cases if played correctly, most players would agree that having shamans backing you up is WAAAAY more fun. Thanks to the Paladin/Shaman dynamic, when 2 really good teams face up against eachother, the alliance team is often forced to turtle as the burst from ele shamans enables the horde team to always be the aggressor.
---
Releasing Honor without BGs isn't the issue. The issue is that Blizzard made the populations larger without addressing any imbalance issues. Either the servers need to be sub 3k players or the imbalance needs to be no greater than 55/45.
---
Should have told him to get the fuck off your server
---
I want flying everywhere. It aggravates me to grind for weeks to earn flying at each expansion. I don't want to run along the ground like a peasant. And I want in-flight combat, too.
---
excuse me most of my pvp experience on RP servers so far was RP with opposite faction so that they let me level in peace. It worked too.
---
Tldr: retail kid mad @ classic
---
I don't think you understand really how leveling with a succ works. You drain tank with wanding being most damage before 38, when drain life gets buff and more damage than wanding.
---
What do you mean 3 mobs at once? you pull 3 and use AoE taunt with the VW and then kill them? Even if you're left with enough mana/hp to continue, AoE is still 2min cd.
---
Also, your succ shouldn't die, ever. shes not tanking the mob forever. it varied a bit but she would tank a couple hits, and the mob would die either running to you or would hit you 1-2 times, which didn't matter, because you just healed it back.
---
The point of drain tanking and using succ is to be able to constantly kill and move on to the next mob without stopping to eat/drink and rarely bandaging. Literally didn't buy or use food/water til I was in my late 50s. You just infinitely kill mobs, drain life, lifetap, with DoTs of course. I was able to duo-pull mobs around my level up to 2 levels higher and not stop ever, 3-4 levels higher i'd have to stop every couple pulls.
---
VW you might kill 3 mobs, but you have downtime in between. Drain tanking with succ, 0 downtime assuming you're doing it right, and its not exactly hard to do.  
---
EDIT: heres the drain tank leveling guild by Dive in the warlock discord :  [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229\_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view)
---
As an alliance on Fairbanks I can confidently say you are wrong.
---
Tbh don't stress too hard the gear that's out rn for pve , only a few peices are forever bis for any class
---
You'll replace most of this stuff, especially weps, in BWL , zg , AQ, naxx
---
The real important things are getting the main tank bindings and getting priests their bene 
---
Getting some talismans on warlocks is also great, cauterizing band is awesome but still all of this stuff except thunderfury get replaced in either bwl or aq
---
Firelord's choker or Onslaught girdle  is prob second best piece in MC because it doesn't get replaced until twin emps in AQ.
---
Just keep trucking, make sure you prove your worth before BWL if your raid is loot council.
---
Getting an early CTS or asscandy is HUGE
---
Sure.
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers
---
Uses data from WL, so only people that Have done onyxia/Mc and don't use private logs are pulled.
---
Closest we'll get to an accurate census, for now atleast.
---
It was a terrible call from blizzard, releasing PVP without BG or Arenas, letting clearly servers with bad ration between population and factions to completely break the game -- it has been so bad that i have quit the game. Taking me more than 1h to get to the entrance of BRD - it had to be done, this game was consuming more time and i would get to the end more frustrated than happy -- Sad that i paid for 6 months and they won't even do a partial Refund, claiming that it as "been" used.   
---
They take bad decisions out of the hat everytime - they break games, they won't even re-consider shout outs, that's it for me and Blizzard won't even play Hearthstone. I'm okay with Mario and nintendo switch - lot more happier.
---
Classic is not a vanilla experience, it’s a classic experience. This isn’t specific to p2.
---
It's called CharacterStatsClassic.
---
heres the link: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/characterstatsclassic
---
There are only two entrances into BRM my dude. What route are you taking that's somehow shorter?
---
That place was amazing when I went. Great views
---
what do you mean? your succ shouldn't die, ever. mine died a handful of times if that and it was usually because of an unintended extra large pull or something rare like that.
---
Max rank until 60+. The last dungeon I healed as shadow was Sunken Temple, so you're fine all the way to mid 50s. Slower heals are more mana efficient than faster. Renew is best used on tanks when they are semi-geared, and DPS when you want to cast it and forget them.
---
Thi K it's called "classic cast bars"
---
Yes very rng, our guild had a binding drop back to back.
---
I spent 2 weeks trying to get that sinew , no dice and found a seller for 330g! I made almost 1000 gold though from skinning and the raw silver per kill
---
See you later man
---
Thanks for crying on Reddit about how you thought you did, but you didn't.
---
You won't be missed.
---
I'm on ashbringer horde and /world was just another /lookingforgroup so I never joined it. It would actually be pretty nice to have lfg/lfm not allowed on there.
---
Sure thing. Try being on the short end of a 32/68 percent pop server and tell me how easy that is
---
On Fairbanks it is ABSOLUTELY a maajor problem. The higher cap doesn't help, but it's not as big of an issue.
---
I'm just working within the rules that are (supposedly given). Why is it called Main spec &gt; Off spec, if it really has nothing to do with spec but with role?
---
Furthermore, I "gimped" myself because I prefer to play daggers. There are no good daggers anywhere but MC right now, so why shouldn't I get priority if it's quite literally written in the name of the ruleset?
---
I haven't had anywhere near the same experience as you, I've barely had bad interactions
---
Other classes have same issues. I saw the pally DI thread and totally agree but an issue I run into alot with healers is the gross excess of overhealing in raids that lead to healers going oom way too fast. PSA don't just look at healing done, overhealing is an important stat that needs to be monitored.
---
Bye
---
My thoughts and prayers mon. At least you are target farming. I'm doing the entire instance but getting to this boss takes 10 min.
---
I live in Taiwan,  but play on US - Deviate Delight just so I can get the RP experience.  
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Thank you for the advice. I will begin my journey vs hydrospawn i know theres a spot vs him think i saw a warlock solo lol. 
---
Never knew about that final spot you mentioned, i usually swiftness pot and jump on the ledge and not die but swiftness pots on my server are 1g15s so expensive i did the math and for now its cheaper dying once then wasting a swiftness pot lol
---
No people were just as trash then.  My groups in classic have been 100x more pleasant.   People today are more efficient, and this includes efficiency in griefing
---
Are these Zalandari Tribe guilds?
---
Imagine having to log onto your throwaway shitpost account to double up on your shit comments lmfao
---
This, fuck off Horde refugees
---
Ppl had saber 2-3 weeks in
---
I'm sure he can sustain some sight during the day. Also projectors are easy on the eyes and dont create any strain. I know because it's the only way I can watch TV / movies.
---
People have given plenty of reasons why they don't like it and it isn't all fanboi-isms. In my own experience people suck on Retail, as in they're just obnoxious or don't speak to you or are super rude. People are just as min-max/elitist there as OP has experienced in Classic, maybe more so, and it seems Retail caters to people to do that more (which is fine for some if you're into that). It feels like a chore instead of a game. Some don't like the slot machine aspect of gearing up, or the constant feeling of having to play catch up. Some hate the story telling. A lot don't like cross servers; my bad experiences could be the servers I'm clustered with but I can't really escape those "bad" servers. I'll sit in a dungeon que just as long as I'll sit on LFG spamming for a group so I don't see the difference there.
---
Back in 2 months
---
I feel your pain with your cape.  Baron is such a bitch to get that one piece of bis.  His loot table is huge and he’s the last boss.  I killed him 26 times before I got robes of exalted on my priest yet in that time saw 10+ people get their cape.
---
&gt;5 set bonus will procc of the 8 set bounces, but healing wave with 8 set bonus will only bounce if there is something to heal (someone must have taken at least 1 point of damage, preferred two players obviously).   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This is based on me trying out full set on official wow classic server for a while. When my healing wave bounce two times after the first target there has been around a 75% proc chance of 5 set bonus (mana surge).
---
Definately wont miss you either :D
---
What would be the problem with changing honor so that only 60s granted honor to other 60s? Such a huge gulf between 59 and 60
---
&gt; (I'm aware large, organised groups prefer Paladins over Hardiness/WotF, but the general PvPer cares more about individual strength, as is evidenced both anecdotally and by faction balance trends among all realms).
---
What Slande said. The color behind their nameplate will be white, DO NOT EVEN GET CLOSE. Super punishing
---
In theory, yes. But from my brief testing so far, the little bastard doesn't seem to co-operate in battle very well; there's long delays between his casts and heals which waste the precious 30 second timer.
---
I'm taking a break now, I'll test it more later and give you an update.
---
its less fun on the Alliance dominated server Deviate Delights.
---
you cant level anywhere without getting jumped by 5 alliance.
---
So much thissssss
---
Every time one of my friends bitch about some decision Blizzard makes, I counter with "it's better than pservers though"
---
It's not a great argument to support Blizzard and their decisions about the game, but fuck it's nice to have an official home.
---
I played on pservers for years and years. Blizzard has been way better. Most servers would have put in a cash shop by now haha
---
&gt;Yes census data has supported that
---
Based on the data I have, it hasn't supported that. This is exactly why I ask you to provide your source.
---
&gt;you can look it up if your interested, you didn't provide any data either
---
I looked it up and the active server population in the last 14 days or total number of characters the proportion is pretty much similar what was the maximum server pop in vanilla aside from a couple of servers Blizzard warned everyone either not to register at or to transfer from.
---
See, I can play this game also?
---
&gt;You honestly think it's more characters but less people playing?
---
The amount of people playing is indeed way less than amount of characters they have created, duh. Your point is?
---
&gt;And no not everyone was warned, you think people on the bad side of an imbalanced server were warned that transfers would fuck their server up?
---
It was expected alliance to be an underdog in wPVP simply because of racials. Thus, more people interested in PVP rolled horde. People who weren't interested in ranking pvp much but wanted to play for dominant faction, rolled horde also.
---
I could be wrong but I feel like if you’re lower health they are more inclined to chase you. So annoying when you’re like 3% and they won’t fuck off.
---
yah, these tryhards are sad and pathetic.  Most of them suck too.
---
Because its fun to play what someone wants to play and not just reroll the meta aka mages/warrs cause thats what everyone is doing. 2h Enh is super fun in BGs and world pvp idk what youre talking about F tier in pvp lol
---
So, value should not be taken into account? If I have a 35dps weapon as rogue, should I be allowed to roll for mageblade, because it got more dps?  Doesn't seem reasonable at all. The value created by giving a rogue a dagger (which he's limited to) far supersedes the value of giving it to a warrior.
---
You can do them all.
---
DPS isn't a spec, it's a role. It's not called main role vs off role, is it?
---
It's amazing, I must not be looking at the same data and stats that labels the horde 90% dominant on all servers. It really just boggles the mind
---
Pvp *as alliance* on a pvp server. 
---
Don’t you dare act like the horde plays the same game.
---
If you're lucky or got a friend, they might let you into Strat, which is very very good for xp.
---
Also alot of good gear for Warlocks in Strat Undead
---
Yeah totally. Still sucks though. I feel bad getting guildies to run it with me because there’s literally nothing in it for them. No exp, no drops and the gold sucks. Ah well!
---
Because you haven't decided on your spec when you are still in prebis, you are just playing the optimal prebis which is swords. You aren't set on anything, you can go both swords or daggers depending on what items you get.
---
From the comments: Judging from the comments, they may never be. They seem to be added in Patch 2.0.1 (i.e. the TBC pre-patch) so should never be a part of Classic.
---
So they may get added? If they do, it'll probably be part of a later phase.
---
Dang yeah I just rolled a warrior last night honestly enjoying it more already
---
why? asmon didnt bann him
---
Stay away from da' voodoo
---
Dont worry you will be doing MC til the end of time.
---
&gt; RP is one of the few things in which Retail has the advantage over Classic.
---
&gt; You have a lot more races, a lot more zones, a lot more toys and pets, a lot more transmogs, a lot more updated lore
---
I agree with this, RP seems like it'd be super fun on Retail. I rolled on WrA just to check it out.
---
This video is shit, just like your opinion.  phase 2 is a literal disaster, and the game is LITERALLY in danger of dying.  But hey, you killed some poor sap trying to kill a devilsaur.  Gratz.  /golfclap
---
Battlegrounds will be released in 3 weeks, so i think that will solve some of it
---
&gt; A 50/50 drop took 12 resets to finally see one...
---
I'm going to puke, don't say that.
---
dude, thats like making 10 elementary schools in your country take iq tests and deducing the amount of elementary school children in your country based on the results.  
---
do you understand now why this doesnt work?
---
My experience has been mostly the opposite. There's some elitism, especially surrounding hybrids, but much more toxic casuals than toxic tryhards.
---
&gt; I needed on all the Necropile pieces as a Warlock because they werent "BiS" for me. A mage literally told me to stop needing on trash items.
---
He's not wrong though? Needing on items you'll never use is kind of a dick move. Those few gold in disenchant value can go quite far. Unless you were trying to make a Warlock Tank build work, of course.
---
&gt;My guild disbanded because some people considered PUGing MC more efficient and productive than running with the guild. Statements like "This game literally is so fucking easy and some people still dont get over 200 DPS." were commonplace in discussions. 
---
Once again they aren't wrong. If someone is doing 200 dps while not dead, on dispel duty, or in any other way excused, they're just being lazy. Even ret paladins can do way better than that. If you refuse to put in the bare minimum of effort and want the other 39 to carry you, you're a dick.
---
&gt;EDIT: Judging by the responses this is EXACTLY the attitude I mean. This insane exclusionary force that tries to invalidate any and all criticisms of their holy Classic, hallowed be thy name.
---
The vast majority of responses to you have been perfectly polite expressions of disagreement. You're the problem.

Interresting. I'll check it out. Thanks man :)
---
It has to depend on the size of your server and faction. On Horde DD we are pretty good about calling out when heads will be dropped. But there are only 10-15 per week I would guess so it’s easier to project

He's there for Balance.
---
He is not here for solution, he wants to be upset about world pvp.
---
Just find a warrior in decent gear and figure out a split on the loot. You don’t need to fit a schedule lol you just need to find a couple hours a week to do runs. Once you get it down you can make 40-60gph before the extra shit from herb/ench/mining so it’s not hard to find a willing partner.
---
Also, lasher runs are basically a waste of time without herb and still not amazing even with herb.  You’re likely to make more money doing other things.
---
26 dm north runs to get kroms chest piece
---
You could just use the in-game api to hook to the tooltip, read the contents of the tooltip to make sure that the tooltip is actually over a Black Lotus, and not someone runnning past you or something, and then play an audio file.
---
That's all easily doable with the in-game API.
---
Oh, I actually haven't paid attention to the "pvp" part of your post. I have seen this website but indeed most alliance-dominated servers are PVE aside from  Heartstriker  which is EU but Germany. 
---
I am not sure if the transfer from overpopulated PVP servers was opened to PVE ones, iirc yes.
---
I see butthurt
---
And gnomes!
---
If enough people report it they have to change it! I saw so many people when servers launched that had to change their names.
---
Thank you !
---
7 perdition blades from 10 MC runs is pretty crazy.
---
U better wach your damn mouth!
---
Straight riposte then hit IMO
---
I like how they feel so relaxed
---
The only reason for that is because I thought Herbalism wouldn’t be a bad choice for DM:E runs but mining seems overall better.
---
tbh i dont care enough about him to check if what you are saying is true or not
---
I play Alliance on Gandling EU and this definitely isn't my experience of it. Searing Gorge in general seems completely Horde dominated and running to BRD is pretty much a constant corpse hop.
---
No we won't, because the vocal minority who cries about pvp can quit the game entirely and we wouldn't know the difference.
---
I don't know exactly what the ratio of angry desk-pounding gamers is compared to normal players, but I'd imagine quite low.
---
There are people who would legit break controllers over things like dark souls, and I think these people are the same. But very, very small representation of overall alliance.
---
I think alot of the complaining is pretty justifiable but I absolutely love this game and am so grateful to have it back
---
Grats ! But i upvoted for the OwlPacino LOL !
---
And up walls
---
Yikes
---
He just wears that BIG DICK arms damage for PvP
---
shoutout lilpumpx he got me my Blackstone ring like 2 months ago
---
I just jump on the front of the boat. If they kill me then I res after the loading screen and jump off and swim. I'd rather waste a little extra time than giving boat campers more honor and don't take res sickness.
---
I love all the people unconcerned about this. I've been seeing it on Kromkrush already. People aren't signing in as much, or have just straight up quit on the alliance side. The worst part is it sucks for everyone. Harder for me to get groups, less people for Horde to pvp. In the end, the horde players will have no one to blame but themselves when pvp collapses due to lack of alliance
---
Druid can be both useful and frustrating in PvP. No class is better at *surviving* PvP. Few classes are worse at *winning* PvP.
---
Warlocks are very strong in PvP due to their ability to chain fear. Hunters are less effective, as the dead zone often cripples them.
---
ooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo
---
Works fine for me?
---
Yea we’ve got the 2x stack strategy down. Could be the shaman chain healer is too close to us. But Definitely feels like there’s an independent lava burst and since we are pulled back to the edge of the lava during Wrath kicks we get hit. So implementing your strategy might help here. 
---
Tank aggro is usually good, sometimes a hiccup, they might be getting punted that’s why. 
---
By phase 2 not enough DPS is alive, 1 main tank might be dead, we are short on mages in general, and gathering the adds is a mess. Think we need to iron that out since people are getting one shotted by adds as we try to gather them (need to cc them better I’m thinking)
---
I do these on my warlock, it was interesting watching a shaman do it.
---
Couple minor pieces of advice. When you first zone in and jump down, walk straight to the ledge, look down and to the right, there’s a rock next to the big tree that I jump to. It saves you from having to deal with the pathing group of trees at the door to the final boss.
---
When jumping to the final boss, try jumping to the pilar with the flat base on top then onto the ledge you fight him on. He won’t ever aggro regardless of his positioning so you don’t have to wait for him to path a certain way.
---
Hope this helps. Love seeing a shaman do this run!
---
That makes no sense, if you are out in the world and just moved to a new zone for questing and you are just a bit under skill level to loot that herb, is the +5 obviously helps. How does it help at the end? Nothing requires 305 as far as I know...
---
She's a lesbian dude. What kind of valid response could you possibly expect from her?
---
Maybe, but it’s still just supply and demand. If there’s none on the AH and you set your own price, then all you need is some background knowledge on who the item is useful to and to what degree. (Is it a twink weapon, is it BiS? Etc.) 
---
Also other factors such as level and age of the server should be taken into consideration. So it’s not as simple as just saying “OH MY ADDON TOLD ME IT GOES FOR 7G”
---
It's easy to say "you should have just rolled PVE" when players weren't warned about the servers being 5x the original population caps before launch.
---
Value is absolutely taken into account. Your entire raid is limited by your main tanks threat. Giving warriors daggers with +5 daggers is going to increase your overall raid dps much more than giving a rogue a weapon. Rogues don’t understand that they don’t really provide any additional value to the raid compared to your main tank. Your mageblade argument is deliberately obtuse..
---
I'd happily pay to transfer my 3 characters, this isn't a vanilla pvp experience at all, it's a private server tryhard super population hellhole.
---
Another horde RPer! So rare. And yeah, I'm in the same boat. RP realm, no real issues with jerks
---
Your party has a choice. Either wait for you to corpse run your way there. Or come help you.
---
There's not much you can do if you're being hunted by a 60 who out-gears you apart from running to the instance as best you can.
---
If they aren't willing to wait and won't come help? Well that sounds like a pretty shitty group.
---
Do dm north for Muggers Belt. Limited to daggers but 1. It's free and 2. Daggers are bis for tanks anyways all else equal (ie no Thunderfury) and you replace it in mc with Aged Core Leather Gloves
---
Have a rogue open any door in DM. Stand next to the door once it’s opened. The ambient sound is a crazy loud thump, and is quite annoying
---
As like getting loot as a shaman is any harder lol
---
why is it that i love fantasy and wow and all that but RPing with other grown men just makes me cringe harder than the Scott's Tots episode of The Office?
---
The slut got her karma and now she won't respond
---
Idk, my a times are higher than ever this week.
---
Thank for the view 😘
---
Hmm we definitely don’t have any mana users in the melee group but could be the healer assigned to us is too close? Lava burst is happening right behind us
---
For a green gun it is .
---
It's only rogues who complain about Spy but we all know Rogues are dicks anyway.
---
Wait till you see a team utilise holy reck bomb paladins. Horde love to focus paladins so you build stacks quick, and you can literally just bounce between 1 shotting and healing.
---
Even as a horde player I mostly agree with you.
---
Welcome to 40 man raiding with 4 items dropping from a 30 piece loot table.
---
FYI to every Horde player trying to go to DM when its camped:
---
You can go into the back entrance of DM East which is located just north of Camp Mojache. Unequipp all your gear and die inside and you'll be put at the regular DM graveyard and can ress inside any of the DM wings.
---
That way you get to DM with only dying once, giving up no honor or durability.
---
You're welcome.
---
Be on a PvE server.
---
I generally solo heal the main tank on garr leaving every other healer on the add tank/raid. I also make sure one of us puts shield on him for the pull as he’s taking enough damage that rage isn’t a problem off the bat. Just stoneshield + shield wall with a force reactive on and all should be good.
---
Phase 2 is Keyring
---
Interesting... wonder why it doesnt.
---
Warrior and Pal, probably the best team you can go in pvp
---
Horde don’t Zerg
---
Sorry for being too lazy to play a video game! Lol
---
Exactly my 3. Point.
---
I can post what id like and those are my reasons for why classic is different from vanilla and its not a good experience for a player like me anymore.
---
The ship is already sinking mate, regardless of my one reddit post.
---
Ill add a trigger warning for you if i ever make another :)
---
Just quit until Dec 10
---
It's not.. unrelated to twitch.. if it's on twitch
---
I'm Ron Burgundy?
---
i acctually left the game and just came back, trying to find a nice corp rn
---
He could be a minor
---
I stood on the hills overlooking the fight. I never tagged a single mob and it completed for me.
---
Took a while for Tirion to show up but he did eventually.
---
If you're worried about it not working I think you can let yourself die to the 'boss' mob. Just don't release until Tirion turns up and finishes all his dialogue. Then you should be able to release and run back to talk to him.
---
shadow priest is a weird way to spell ret paladin
---
Think of it as another option for gold farming. There’s a lot to be said about solo farming something on your own terms. I bet you a warrior or rogue would love the ability to do solo DM East runs!
---
Still most people want to min max in the game. You shouldn’t disparage that against others who want to do the best they can in pve.
---
YES PLS! 
---
sry for caps :)
---
give karazhan,
---
finish azshara and put a raid there, 
---
i think i also saw something back in da day that uldum was supposed to b vanilla content (not sure tho).
---
its still quite early to b talking about classic+ tho.
---
plus, i rly think many many guilds will struggle in naxx. guilds coming from the pservers that have been doing naxx for years will probb storm thru it but the general amount of guilds will struggle there, be it for lack of tanks, or ppl that cant/wont take naxx serious, cuzz it does involve some more hardcore (preparation wise) approach then mc, bwl, even to some extent aq40
---
also, bring arenas into vanilla.
---
NO TBC CLASSIC PLS! had very nice and memorable raids, but damn the flying part of it :( (for me it killed the world)
---
Man nurfed. I kind of miss the videos they had. They had a southshore va tsrren mill video that introduced me to the band "ra".
---
Wish I could see them again.
---
And we definitely don’t have goblin guards with knock back arrows that send your ass to booty bay from grom’gol.  The difference between the alliance and horde defenses is stupid.  It lets our boats be camped all day.
---
I had eye surgery when I was a kid, but I just built LEGO’s while taking short glimpses at the instructions. Probably a different surgery considering I couldn’t fully open my eyes for almost a week.
---
But posting on r/memes and being an Asmongold viewer definitely makes you look older than 14...
---
Cry about it.
---
The boats have 8+ horde on them, each, every flightpath camped and killed
---
you are throwing your life
---
I have no idea, sorry. I haven't leveled my alt recently, but I know it takes at least a few hours to find a group as a healer at lvl 60 and I'd assume, longer during leveling.
---
This is the first time I see anyone claim that +1 is something other than what the previous guy wrote.
---
The loot system you are talking about is known as Loot List (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhq1pf/has_anyone_used_a_loot_list_guild_loot_system/).
---
Yea weird stuff happens at lower levels lol
---
Lies, pve was released together with pvp server
---
I see no reason why the PvE population wouldn't queue for BGs, considering it has some pretty interesting rewards. Rolling on a PvE server doesn't mean people have no interest in PvP, it's just that they didn't want to have to deal with greatly imbalanced WPvP or simply wanted to focus on leveling to get to run end-game content. 
---
PvP is a fun side game and I think even people on PvE realms enjoy BGs.
---
not worth the investment i'm afraid, how much % profit are you gonna make on these probably not more than 20-30% of their existing pricetag.
---
How am I biased if I use the correct meaning of the words I'm using?
---
Facts. I've played WoW for 15 years, and just tried RPPVP for the first time. Grobbulus Horde is the best server I've ever played on. My alliance alts on Deviate Delight have had a similar experience.
---
P2 ain’t liking that UI, THAT’S for sure, war/pala is pretty good

You're the only one to respond. Maybe you?

It kinda isn't no. Go get a raid dagger then come back, or you can throw away all your dignity and play as a filthy hemo rogue.
---
u/bulletproofbra delete your attention-seeking shitpost
---
What??? We have gotten 5 mageblades (4 in. A row) o.O
---
Only reason its frustrating is because it's the OP's that don't understand it's on them to create the experience for themselves. Not blizzard or anybody else here on reddit. There are ingame alternatives to move around the world and/or level and instead its paragraph long posts why the game sucks or isn't what you thought it was, and at the same time cursing the other faction or blizzard for allowing it to happen. Yes it's a lazy and entitled mindset to have
---
Thank you! Don't think i would've found him
---
On large servers the guards don’t even really matter anyway. On incendius there is open world pvp inside of gadgetzan where people are just fighting in town. 1 guy will get killed by guards and then the rest of the players are basically free to just continue fighting.
---
Man I had a dream I had an insane looking silver grey set on my UD warrior. Then I woke up :'(
---
That looked like they were working on a budget of about 500$..........
---
This is where you have made your drastic and crucial mistake: you confuse "characters seen" with "players" which has nothing to do with the world online population. It doesn't matter how many characters were created on server, it matters how many characters can stay online at server at once before a queue is created (2.5k at vanilla launch then enlarged to 3.5k at least according to blizz employees) since that's actually can create an impact on server situation.
---
I will use your own source to prove you wrong: 
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?dateFrom=2019-11-18&amp;dateTo=2019-11-27&amp;realm=4726_Sulfuras
---
As you can see it's ~4.5k concurrent online being the highest peak with 3.5k being the rough average. Which coincidentally matches the vanilla cap: while peaks actually exceed this amount, we can see alliance was more dominant than horde sometimes. 
---
I wonder what kind of an excuse are you going to pull off next. "3-4 times" lol
---
&gt; You think they enjoy corpsekilling you? No we honestly don't, it's just the honor grind.
---
Anyone who spend their time constantly camping for rank can kiss my dick.
---
The terrain was made for horde to win! xD
---
and it was already built in early 2004, it was not made at the last minute
---
You are painting this as the player where responsible for this.
---
Blizzard hasn't setup enough servers and people didn't have much choice in many case. The cheapness of blizzard provoke this mess.
---
Yes the imbalance isn't the only issue but that doesn't mean it's not relevant, it is just even more on huge population servers.
---
Pretty 4/20
---
Dragon isle sound cool did they redo that as another instance

Wait... so all these dead skellies was for nothing???
---
Edit: I just looked this up on wowhead and I don't think you're right.
---
Believe me, we donated to the cause. We were still 6 ingots and ~35 bars short, though.
---
I dont see how it's the horses fault though. It's not like they're doing anything different than alliance, they're just greater in numbers. Which is blizzard's fault.
---
You'll go there eventually, massive amount of quests.
---
Definitely feels like 80:20 based on being a horde main and leveling an alliance alt to 35. LFG chat is dead as fuck on alliance side, even during primetime.
---
I did do a bit of Southshore PvP with my guild, and Alliance never progressed past the road. Hell, they rarely got out past the flight master.
---
not yet, but it might be coming in retail soon
---
&gt;friends are quitting, guildies are quitting, so i guess ill quit too
---
Sounds like you played for the people and not the game anyways.
---
Mining is a good money maker tbh
---
No someone plays 3rd base
---
It happens on both menethil boats on razorgore eu, as well as all flightpaths that arent in capitols.
---
I will have one of the best days of my life reading here and on the wow forums when the BGs go live at the horde complaining about the queue for WSG being an hour long.
---
We have 4 fully geared druids and warlocks (a piece of warlock gear dropped from every boss on Tuesday), but have gotten 2 pieces of rogue tier gear since we began raiding.
---
Dagger rogues have priority over sword rogues, however daggers are good for both tanks and fury warriors and therefore mainspec. In a pug it doesn't really matter if an item is better for one player than another because there's no single guild to benefit. Try joining soft reserve runs instead.
---
Yes but tanks have so many other options. You have to consider the availability of what each class can get.
---
EPICS
---
There are too many people saying it's only horde doing this. When there are alliance dominated servers that are just bad.
---
No you heard STFU.
---
How correct could it be if the overwhelming sentiment in this thread is that you're wrong?
---
:thinking:
---
People interpret the rules in different ways. The glory of it is if you don't like how the leader is handling it, you can... *leave* and find a group that handles it the way you like!
---
Amazing!
---
We get corpsecamped in BB on razorgore eu
---
Clearly not, Iam bored at work. 
---
It's just funny to me that people think we care about how they feel for retail.
---
PvP on a PvP server
---
The fun in raiding , to me anyway , is the progression of the grp . Getting gear is a bi-product. I feel like if you dont get that raiding in classic is not for you .
---
Makes it even more normal, Shadow Weaving isn't affected by gear.
---
Wow thats nuts.
---
Dps having it doesn't matter if you can't hold threat on their dmg
---
That's why tanks get prio in HC guilds, it just makes everything easier
---
If you're at 6k threat before the first frostbolts/shadowbolts/eviscerates go out (assuming the warriors are all prioing 5 sunder stacks) you'll literally never lose threat .
---
My tank feels like you do, and he's the raid lead, but sometimes the dps will take advantage of his kindness . He passed on first two CHT and now regrets it, he just got DB last week (shit drop rate for our guild tho, there's only 3 in two raid groups)
---
I'm telling you, it may seem selfish but the logic is there. It's better for the raid and the dps especially to yield the tank loot , especially if it's affecting tps the way that those weapons do for fury prot. 
---
Like rings? Sure , pass band of accuria to  the rogues. But weapons really should be tank prio until thunderfury is on the maintank 
---
For 4H in naxx u need 8 geared tanks , and when I say geared I mean "if you lose threat for a second the raid wipes" geared...
---
And if the dps can dps sooner in the fight, on any fight, it means their dmg will be higher . The faster the tank gens aggro the more loose the dps can play.
---
Or the steam things in MC. Thought I had static coming from my headset until I moved my character
---
Yea that is what i'm concerned about, my guild got the binding from Garr, which I actually got back in Wrath on my death knight farming for gold. I didn't get the left binding until Mists of Pandaria, I had all the mats and kept farming it for LITERAL YEARS. If this left binding takes as long for this guild as it did for me back when I was soloing it...
---
Yeah y’all could also go ahead and recommend him a brand of tampons to use on a PvE realm.
---
Sounds like your just unlucky.  
---
At least you get a lot of chances at that sweet cloak, and the mount!
---
Faerlina as much as it sucks to say.
---
You know how I know you are lying? The “under an hour” part...
---
Well if it's so well known as being badly designed for pvp (your words) then that's even more reason for people not to roll on a pvp server and go pve isn't it.  Hence why it's stupid to be complaining about it now after they only have themselves to blame.
---
Barman's is best pre raid because of the slow attack speed which makes your backstabs hit and crit harder. There are no slower daggers pre-raid.
---
Raids were also called dungeons by the devs.
---
For the dungeon builders they are the same, they are just bigger dungeons.
---
You can see on the list karazhan, AQ, dragon isles, black temple were raids because they have a "+" in their level range
---
Undercity, Kargath and basically all BS and SG are alliance territory. Almost the same with fellwood and Azahara as well badlands, let alone western plagelands barricades and such. Winter spring is maybe the only balanced zone. We re outnumbered hard, alliance if loses, comes back as double or triple. Only in the nights you can find some balance.
---
I’m on a close to 50/50 and Morgan’s vigil is pretty much 24/7 camped. Doesn’t happen with the horde place in burning steppes though because the graveyard is right next to it and it’s easy to push people out of there. 
---
Thorium point is more of a tossup on who controls it. It’s pretty much guaranteed you will die at trying to get into BRM
---
Or... because of the 3 reasons mentioned in the original post.. its simply bad gameplay at this point.
---
Blasphemy, i know.
---
Why should i put more effort into enjoying a game? There are plenty of other things to do
---
2, but yeah :p
---
phase is killing /killed the game for a lot of ppl
---
C'mon m8, BiS is BiS, options are irrelevant.
---
The faster than tank gens threat the faster the dps can start doing dmg and popping CDs 
---
Theres a reason the best guilds prio loot to their main tank, and I promise it's not cuz each of those main tanks are best friends with their LC's haha
---
Reminds me of our first Rag kill back in the day, except it was a lone priest with a smite that finished him off.
---
I don’t play horde so I’m not a child no
---
OK boomkin
---
yeah they tickle
---
blizzard will probably start merging servers and or allowing more transfers. It seems to me when a lot of people start complaining they will change it. Layering, spy addon are 2 that come to mind.
---
We are bringing hunter alts in for domo so the leaves aren’t left in the box...
---
I did that today for 1,5h hours and made decent money, thank you! But maaan there was quite some competition! It was crazy. Even some nightelves there.
---
Edit: funnily we established some routes all without any communication between us where everyone had around 3 cages for themselves after some time.
---
Btw: is there any use for the fish you get as the quest reward?
---
Not really, it’s more a case that each faction has its gank squad, there’s not point trying to fight these gank squad since it’s not honor/time worth.
---
We probably have some horde one in the alliance boat, thorium point is horde 80% of the time.
---
The system is dumb, if you bother building a group to kill one of them, they’ll just go elsewhere for 15mn, you’ll have wasted time and them not much, you’re losing even if you wipe them. It only promotes farming people that can’t do anything and not pvp fight. That’s why even on my balanced server you get thorium heavily horde farmed but zepelin and undercity entrance are full of allies. Nobody bother fighting each other and instead farm people in one way fight
---
Well yeah. Thats the most important aspect of the game imo
---
Yet to find out! I feel like the heal might come in handy during Raid bosses; it's certainly not a weak heal and it can go off multiple times with a bit of luck.
---
the question is if he is focusing on a wow character/twitch "personality", or is he focusing on whatever asmonds real name is. the way i see it (and by no means i pretend to be right) is that he is targeting an in game player, on an opposite faction, that is talking shit about his faction. from that view i would say its perfectly fine on a pvp domain. ps srr for any spelling/grammar mistakes english is my 3 language. pss btw looking at this drama as an eve player, wich may cloud my judgement about stalking/hunting a player.
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUOOOOOOOOOOUUUUOOOOOOO
---
Maybe when it was down to you and one other in the group leader kicked you instead of leaving group. I've got a friend that does this, and I always tell him he's a dick head.
---
Sorry for playing the game as intended lol
---
I've been pvping since the game came out in 2004/2005, so I'm used to it, and I *love* ridiculously hard games like Devil May Cry/Dark Souls.
---
I'd get pissed off and lose *a lot*, but I mean... I just get better the more I play. I see it as a win. 
---
I think half these players are borderline about to have a stroke from all the anger. I can just feel the seething rage as they type out their manifestos for how pvp should be regulated, lol.
---
I don't think that's the case, there's a large number of people who played retail pve servers (all retail servers are now pve...) who have just made a stupid decision they now regret.  Instead of being adult about it and realising they have no one to blame but themselves and moving on, they decide to whine and complain on forums and demand blizz does something.
---
Our gm does 0 farming and his level 60 warrior alt is better geared in boes than most mains (LHH, strongarm, epic mount, Axe of deepwoods, etc). It's a strange coincidence I'm sure
---
well, it's true, the cape dropped 4 times, once I got it, once it went to greed(!) :D.
---
This comment is peak /r/classicwow community, spending  3 angry paragraphs with references trying to school someone on how they know how to level a warlock better. Also I dont mean pulling 3 mobs with the vw. I mean sending the vw on one, putting one or two dots on it, fearing + dot bombing another then full dotting one more while draining life/mana from it. As soon as one dies you add another to the process. And yes there is a small amount of downtime but it is about 10 seconds every 15 dead mobs with 0 soulshard usage.
---
I think they still have a fair boe drop rate. Just not a lot of stockade specific items like DM and SM do.
---
I play alliance there. Seems like a bad choice.
---
Can you believe I forgot to test if it can be targeted! Lol. For now I'm gonna say no it can't. But I'll get back to you.
---
So whats funny? The video ended before the guy said what was funny :(
---
Alliance has paladins. Imbalance favors alliance
---
I´m actually fury :D. But thanks, that has a lot of useful information!
---
I didn't think anyone that doesn't know me would care about how i feel about anything. I think my comment made you upset because im not a fan of retail? You must enjoy that game and that's good for you bro. Play what you enjoy.

Pass
---
It's basically ElvUI with BenikUI on top
---
MC was already complete in  alpha builds early/mid 2004 long before release.
---
 only the basic layout was a made in a week(that's the myth), it still took months to create the creatures, quests, items, bosses and polish it.....
---
&gt; I promise it's not cuz each of those main tanks are best friends with their LC's haha
---
doubt X
---
On Vanilla everything was new to players - they were looking around for stuff and doing more stuff - we all know that we need honor for trinkets and pvp gear , which wasn't very clear at the time -- people were not "FARMING" players on dugeon entrances like this. Blizzard just didn't take that in consideration, the roll out may be the same, players are not.
---
Flag this as NSFW
---
Priests are arguablly the best healers in the game and definitely the smoothest levelers. With 5 points into Spirit tap you will never have to sit down and drink for mana :)
---
Holy paladins are also great at healing but I have heard that their leveling experience is one of the most boring ones out of all classes, but I don't know from first hand.
---
FFS dont spoil grind zones
---
none do not go enchanting its a giant waste of money
---
You dont lose any of the gcd for your spells but you miss out on about half of a gcd of right click damage from your weapons as they're not equipped for that short duration. Still worth the swap in most all circumstances.
---
Current Main is a rogue. Not really enjoying it. 
---
Thought about either Druid, Shadowpriest or Shaman for PvP (premades).
---
How are these classes at 60 and especially in PvP compared to a rogue?
---
Netherwing yesterday night took 1 hour and 10 minutes to fucking enter the fucking dungeon because of those virgins pvpers
---
Census simply does manual addon /who spam, nothing more. It has nothing to do with the actual faction presence in the open world actively doing wPVP.  If one faction, while being on par online with other, decides to tuck its tail and sit in the capital or farm dungeons, people will have a biased impression of imbalance 70/30 I won't argue with that. But that's solely this faction fault.
---
All we ever looked at was who killed the hardest bosses and had the best pve gear. We were ofc a bit impressed with those very few that was decked in rank 14 pvp gear but we thought of them as selfish assholes. Wow is mostly a pve game and it’s from pve one gets the fame.
---
I feel like you just read the first four words of the title and then looked at the picture.
---
Is there an actual movie too or is that it?
---
Yeah you're right every single main tank of all the top 25 guilds are all best friends with their LC 
---
That's not a broad overgeneralization at all , completely reasonable xD
---
They were rare in vanilla... but that's because a lot of people weren't even running MC and pug MC wasn't a thing until like AQ patch and later.
---
There's gonna be shitloads of them this time around.  Same as there are already shitloads of hammer of rag even though it was rare as fuck in real vanilla.
---
Ehh, no horde are going to make their way out there for a kill or two per hour. They'd rather just camp BRD. Besides there's always turtle island south of tanaris.
---
i hope she was given all loot including that which she couldn't use/equip.
---
imagine the satisfaction.
---
Okay so that’s your opinion and you have no say on what twitch want and don’t want on their platform, and I am very grateful for that considering you would be okay with targeted harassment.
---
I think I saw it die once and it looked like it had 500 hp. Very scared of that. Hope I am remembering it wrong.
---
people not getting to 60 in 3 months time because "real life" happened, people with multiple chars below 60 because "i felt like it" are then complaining about being ganked or whatever... seriously, read between the lines, lots of of players didn't belong on pvp servers in the first place and are complaining now just because their favorite streamer told them "phase 2 is going to be the golden age of classic"... legit [harden the fuck up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xvkAPXB9c) or follow your leader and go back to retail.
---
edit: insta downvote ofc, i think the initial pvp servers blizz put up were just enough, just to many people thinking highly of themselves getting their ego put in check now and they can't handle it. that is true for both sides btw, horde on our server is logging in less as well.
---
My addons that shows crit % seems to count both options. Course addon might be wrong too

What’s life like as a raiding tank warrior? I know your likely to have the highest repair bill, and farming gold etc is terribly slow with a tank build, and respecs get expensive.  Do guilds usually help out with these kind of expenses?
---
Your sarcasm doesn't make your statement any less true. Top 25 guilds didn't pug their tanks, they have been part of the core, which means they are almost certainly good friends with the LC.
---
This ain't rocket science.
---
Mage is the ultimate casual friendly class. Self supporting, more so than warlock, high damage and great solo wpvp. 
---
Only con is that it feels like your playing the game on easy mode. Considering majority of your prebis is significantly easy to farm.
---
DPS means absolutely nothing in PvP, are you even serious? If you get CCed, slowed, if you can't connect for even 0.2-0.3 seconds that extra DPS is effectively wasted. Attack power in a vacuum is meaningless- the effective damage range and top end damage are all that counts, and Ashkandi is very slightly lower there, and lacks the Fireball proc.
---
The only reason you'd use a sword in PvP would be for premades (and TBC arena taught us that mace stun is king there too lol) and you're going to want BRE, not Ashkandi, anyway. You're also never using HoJ.
---
And as stated for paladins and shamans it's simply king for a very, very long time.
---
I'm horde on horde dominated servers and DM path is still griefed by ally gankers. These players are like some rabid dogs.
---
You can choose to PvP on a PvE server. You can't do anything in the open world on a 1:8 server on the lower pop faction.
---
Hey! Atleast spriest buffs Warlocks.....
---
😂
---
Horde are fucking ugly,  90% of your races don't know how to wear boots properly.
---
You’re a tag stealing hunter. This is no great feat... try being something without an instant ranged pull and a pet.
---
yes, i mean only the part when u r trying to find somebody. yes, there could start some long term friendships laster in the dungeon, but the searching part is just pain
---
No u definitely want hit before anything. Cant kill something quick if all u do is miss.
---
Gear good enough gear from dungeons, join Molten Core and Onyxia
---
Alliance camps Blackrock Mountain to every 50's+ complain.
---
Won’t
---
Help
---
Anything
---
There are too many variables.  Say you have 1000 horde and 1000 alliance on but only 200 of the alliance are 60 where 900 of the horde are. On some servers there are people doing 20 multibox just to watch black lotus spawns. All these things would affect these questions negatively, you would still see a huge imbalance. 
---
On a lot of the severs with mega imbalance the lesser faction is under leveled and undergeared. That’s not something that will be fixed even with server ques
---
Makes me realize i've always played on mute..
---
Must have been because of the "I dont have enough mana" spam.. Am I missing out ?
---
At 39 you have a decent selection of abilities on all classes and makes it more versatile in your class selection than the 19 and 29 bracket. 39 bracket opens up the door to all casters for the first time and it's just considered a good balance of simplicity and complexity.
---
Pretty sure It's the other way around my g
---
You're not sadly.
---
Yes that's how it works.
---
Get them against all the other dual wielders
---
it is much shorter than wintersaber. Most ppl have timbermaw at revered before they even reach half of honored. Usually you end up with timbermaw exalted at around 12k revered for wintersaber (75%).
---
Also you lose in best case scenario 40% of time by running to q giver where with timbermaw you can farm non stop.
---
Or just cut out the middleman and use combat log
---
I dont see how people sit in front of instances.....
---
I made a comment on a post a while ago about doing transfer charters where you come over in groups. Surprised blizz hasn't done it yet.
---
Thank you. Coming for Lineage 2, priests looked like the better choice to me too. I also heard that it's easier to play priests on horde since they don't have to heal groups as much because of shamans.
---
There's two type of stream sniping, the one that Asmongold loves, I.E him getting free gold free boosts, as a Streamer he will never have to wait for a dungeon or type in chat looking for a party, he can just say "Invite me" and he will be given hundreds of Invites, but he loves this type of stream sniper.
---
The type he hates? Well one that he allows to happen, being killed because he showing where he is, and telling the audiences where he's going
---
It's a Job, and all Jobs have some forms of risks, Work in Construction? One day you might trip or slip, Bash your hand on something hard damage your back, hell you might follow all H&amp;S but some other idiot does something that leads to your injury
---
Asmongold risk to his job? Someone watching his stream and killing his ingame character
---
But guess what, one of those despite one of those doing something that can psychically injure you for life, or kill you, pays FAR less than the other, and the risk to the highest paying one? "He watch my stream"
---
"harassment" when Asmong reads someone chat logs on stream, is that not harassment? when he then opens their armoury to mock them because he didn't like their opinion, is that not harassment? he has a following of Toxic viewers that likely keeps and even increased the level of harassment...
---
I've defended Asmon in the past on this very subreddit, but this is a total bitch Move on Asmon part, some of the shit Asmongold had said on stream is darn right border lining and I'm shocked he wasn't banned for Harassment himself already.
---
The game launched with optimized stats on all gear making the encounters easier. That and everyone knows the fights and the specs that help you clear the content faster.
---
But classic is the nerfed version of vanilla.
---
"Let me make a post complaining about people complaining that will fix everything"
---
No, fuck you and this attitude and you dumb straw man argument.  Pvp isn’t being mind controlled when you land and being forced to attack, skipping honorless Target and being annoyed it it isn’t being soft.
---
When everyone quits because of this, which is what’s happening, you can enjoy sitting at flight paths with no one to kill.
---
Play on Grob. bc I wanted to get my buddies into the RP realm. I try to RP whenever possible, some of my buddies get into it, but some people on our server just don't give a fuck. Can be super frustrating, especially when people just want to get in general chat and trade to just talk shoot about RP
---
I want to theorise that in BGs, due to all the alliance rage quiting, we will be left with players who know what they are doing. Players who know how to deal with this boat camping issue. Will ultimately be better in general. 
---
So I want to believe that the players who can adapt will be in BGs and alliance will win alot of BGs. Top that off with instant ques, I'm happy I'm alliance. 
---
Overall I'm happy I'll have fast BG ques.
---
yeah the name looks different but it's completely unreadable sadly
---
My orc female wears boots gracefully than you very much
---
That's such a self-defeating mindset. The more people do that, the worse it'll get. You're only contributing to your own problem if you do that.
---
Whats good enough gear for MC?
---
Mara is a nice lazy farm, and since I'm Herb/Engi it's the preferred choice.
---
Solo Jump runs are stressful because you can make a lot of mistakes. Mara is stupid easy/lazy so it's nice when you're watching movies/tv
---
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. And another oh no. Whoever desined it then was pure satan himself. Looks like a spirit but can be targeted and dies easily... Guess I will still go farm honor and ekkos with guild, but won't make it top priority anymore :(
---
Man you’re so much better at this game than I am lol! Nice plays....even if they were bad you were reacting pretty quickly to each situation.
---
It’s pretty funny all these people who think they are about to hit the jackpot stashing all these items. The market is going to be SOOO saturated.
---
&gt;Another point is that when BWL comes out it makes ONY and MC obsolete
---
I've never seen this point. Raids in vanilla never become obsolete.
---
eye surgery = can't get out of bed????..... question mark?
---
Was it *really* necessary to make a post about you quitting? Nobody cares man.
---
"You think you do, but you dont" was straight facts for some of these players.
---
Or SilverDragon, I know it’ll do this for rare mobs for sure but as long as it has a wowhead id# it should work for plants as well
---
Yeah man it sucks. I don’t really have a solution for you. I took a lot of care in choosing a server with 2 strong factions but I definitely feel sad for people who assumed they would all be good and then got screwed :(
---
I don't care about your stance on retail mate, and even tho I like the game aestetic their loot system and overall balance is bullshit. 
---
I could have the same argument about you being upset for my comment and replying when you shouldn't care and still here we are. 
---
But your right my comment is as irrelevant as the part on classic from yours.
---
Or the entrance of a dungeon... WWWZZSWSSZWWSZSWWWWWSSSSZZZSSWWWWWWWWZZZZSWWWWZZSWWWWWWWWWWWWWWSSSZZZZZZZWWWWWW
---
&gt; The slut got her karma
---
my god lmao please go outside
---
Too many. Plus other rl issues
---
Nah legit wondering the keyboard mouse setup as well as I am a veteran of bedly gaming
---
The way we do it, locks banish 3-4 adds. Main tank and melee hit garr, while off tanks take the remaining adds just far enough from garr to avoid explosions but not enough to get  the buff. Ranged focuses 1 add at a time, untill only banished are left. Then we kill garr and clean up banished adds one at a time. No fire resist gear, unless it happens to already be a piece of gear you have. Main tank gets "useless" buffs such as underwater breathing and see invisibility to mitigate buff loss from garr.
---
Edit: added the following
---
Sometime we have hunters put the adds to the off tanks. 
---
Ive yet to flask on garr, but use fortitude (with giants) and superior defense, along with a few others. I believe garr can not remove "consumable" buffs, just casted buffs.
---
HURR DURR RED IS DEAD ZUG ZUG
---
Grats from another on Zandalar Tribe! Our guild is still getting there.
---
Idk. Was it really necessary to reply to my post?
---
I dont care if you dont care
---
Get as many BiS pieces you can from dungeons, you don't need any epics or anything
---
Well auctioneer is super confusing for me. I’m a new player. If the others are bad then they don’t seem to be of help. I just want to see a historical run down of what an item sold for so I can see if I am underselling an item by a large amount.
---
&gt;very fine people on both sides
---
PvG will not last very long. The initial surge is a nice way to weed out those who can't handle getting camped for a couple of weeks.
---
In other words, found the Alliance player
---
Good for you, bud. I never claimed to be a "revolutionary theory rafter" it's well known that 2 1h from 50-60 if you have a good MH is better than 2h leveling. Gl
---
I actually kind of spoke with someone about this in another thread yesterday(?). I mentioned that unless the profits are split completely even, I make more money doing a solo jump run as a priest with herb than duo jumps with a miner.
---
I clear 7 packs of lashers (could make it 8 and still stay under 12min clears, it just bothers my timing) and get the 4 herb nodes in the lasher area. With greens, greys and various herbs from loot, I average 55-60g/hour.
---
His numbers assumed 1-2 arcane crystals per hour, plus DE mats and such, and would result in his share being about 75g in about 1.5 hours (so 50g/hr). They didn’t herb. If you alone ran at exactly half their pace, you’d make slightly less due to lack of enchanting (you’d also have to sell more often from bag space issues). But would you be able to keep that pace including downtime, which their combo would have little-to-none? I honestly don’t know that answer.
---
Overall, I feel numbers are very similar between the two, but mining ***can*** be higher with luck (if you happen to get a lucky streak on crystals). Herbalism is probably more consistent though (you are guaranteed 2 nodes of dreamfoil and gromsblood each).
---
Yeah I did my first BRD run of classic yesterday and had a similar experience. Died probably 10+ times. Horde spaced out the entire way from Thorium Point to the instance. Took almost an hour for everyone to get in. Absolutely horrible experience that I won't be repeating ever again. 
---
Tried questing in WPL before the BRD run. Flew into Chillwind and got ganked. Rezed and got killed again. Spawned at South Shore because I died in Alteric Mountains. Took rez sickness and got killed in the GY.
---
2/3 hour queues for the above experience. I'm done until WSG comes out.
---
What type of pie is BiS for thanksgiving?
---
Was giving him the benefit of the doubt, but he knows that he's wrong and wants to double down.
---
&gt;Classic megaservers. Realm pop is way more than vanilla servers.
---
Could you please define "way more"?
---
&gt;Faction imbalance is horribly skewed. On many servers its as bad as 70-30, or worse!
---
That's the community fault (and partly blizzards by doing horde racials better for PVP in vanilla: though you cannot blame them for it). Still the final nail in the coffin was done by mass alliance transfers from servers they felt imbalanced.
---
&gt;Tryhards. I played vanilla and there was gankers, wpvp etc, but the amount of people «farming» honor is ridiculous.
---
Everyone saw it coming several months ago. It was completely expected. Is there any way you intend to fix it, change the whole community mentality? I highly doubt so.
---
If it makes it happy, people with R14 will be those who either write a really good variation of HB (unlikely) or simply those buying the boost (a lot lot lot of them).
---
I'm not upset. I responded to your response to me lmao.
---
Except for Blackrock. There always seems to be 80+ lvl 60 horde from thorium point all the way into the mountain killing alliance. Horde seems to be actively trying to prevent alliance from doing any black rock.
---
My guild actually thought about letting me go shadow in raid for shadow weaving, but with disc/shad or holy/shad so I can still heal after I get the 5 stacks. If I could go 31points in shad I would do it.
---
Yeah that’s what I thought. I’ve had minor surgery done on my eyes twice and both times they heavily suggested to not do anything that’d strain my eyes (gaming etc.).   
---
Even if it’s not a monitor, it’s still going to be a lot of work tracking movement for extended periods of time.
---
Which PvE server has a decent horde pop? I’m in the EU, sick of getting ganked
---
I mean dude, level how you want, I don't care. I was simply trying to help because you clearly don't know much about lock/leveling. Apologies for trying to help show you a better/faster way to level, I understand some people like to take the game slower, take in the sights, and take their time killing stuff. 
---
Fear isn't exactly a great and reliable tool for general leveling killing mobs, how often does that mob get feared into other mobs or a whole pack? I can count the times I used fear on mobs while leveling on one hand.
---
and where is this shard thing coming from? you use 1 shard to summon your succ. you also use 1 shard to summon your VW. where is this massive shard usage drain tanking uses coming from? and did you even look at the guide? I didn't make it, I credited who did, and tons if not most warlocks recommend if not swear by this guide or drain tank leveling in general. I'm not some bozo that thinks my niche leveling build is better than yours because magic and "it just is", this thing has been tested and proven beyond exhaustion, the warlocks that came up with this do that kinda stuff for fun and its based off extensive testing, experience, etc etc.
---
like I said, level how you want, but i'm not posting this shit for my health or because I think you're a dumb noob, I just like helping other warlocks out that may or may not know better ways to do things. I didn't even get my VW and his skills til 60, succ carries you all the way home.
---
We got Garr binding first night of raiding together, then another Garr binding the following week. That was about a month ago. Fk U Geddon.
---
What if I wanna be a bear?
---
I know you are not upset, Iam just using the same logic as you when you say Iam.
---
That's rad, how long did it take ya?
---
Horde bad Alliance good
---
Ah yes, memes on the front page with 2-4K upvotes getting deleted because of a few that reports sounds like a fully functional system, right?
---
in total agreement and i don't take a single second for granted. past couple of days especially.
---
even last night i barely got to play cuz of exhaustion literally all i did was travel from org to tarren mill and ran to Hinterlands. i didn't use any wowhead or anything and explored the map to find the horde camp myself (with a little help from some hordies along the way) and it was a great. had a wonder round reventusk (i think that's the name of the camp) for a bit before going to bed. literally travelled from A to B and had a fucking blast doing it.
---
I play on ZT too (Horde) and 8 out of 10 times I land in a contested territory I get instakilled at the flymaster and camped. I have to do 2-3 corpse runs every time, just to give in Quests.
---
Roll on a PvE server, that's what all of us who wanted to avoid this bullshit did.
---
If you want to raid as fury get dal rend swords and devilsaur set. + hit is hard to get as a warrior which early on is the most important stat.
---
It took us an hour to get to brd the other night, and we had to 3 man arena runs because we couldn't find any other person on the server willing to waste that much time just getting to the instance.
---
It's probably to shove it in the faces of all the little cunts who gave him grief about rolling on a pve server before launch when they thought they were superior.
---
It is actually quite funny to watch all of them moan like little bitches now.
---
lol what? do you really think people don't do MC in under an hour? tons of guilds do. record right now is like 25 minutes with numerous around 30 min mark. 
---
i'd say "i'll pull up our logs to show you" but just based off the fact that you don't think a guild can clear MC in an hour or less I know it isn't worth showing you anything, you wouldn't even know what you are looking at. Nevermind man, you're right, I was lying, we clear 8/10 MC one night in about 3 hours and then do the last 2 bosses and ony the next night in about 2 more hours lol....
---
When I right click on my desktop an Nvidia option pops up
---
&gt; What you should do is go to a major city and gather a group of people to go and fight back the Horde.
---
I'm convinced that those who say this while thinking it's trivial for any person to do, don't play Alliance, or even play WoW at all.
---
Still ugly though.
---
Yeah it’s going to be funny when this guy gets dumped from the raid the first time they start wiping on harder content. If he doesn’t want to wear the best gear then he definitely isn’t using consumables, etc.
---
This nutcase is the perfect representation of your average horde player that joins 40 man raid groups to split 1 HK between all of them
---
What a douchebag
---
Like no offense, but if you would have spend 10 seconds actually looking at the blades you would know.
---
Ah, good chuckle
---
why do you type "expansion" like that
---
Duo runs are completely ruled out for me. I want less variables and dependency on others for my profitability. 
---
You’re also guaranteed 2-3 rich thorium veins after last boss in solo runs.
---
The funny thing is you could both be referring to the same age.. one of you could be 60 and refer to younger players being 40 year olds and the other one is 25 and refers to them as older players. :P
---
Personally I find 20 year olds are less likely to roleplay, thought there is apparently a resurgence of DND for youngish people (twitch crowd) due to marketing. There's even a theater in Brooklyn where hipsters watch people play live.
---
Unfortunately I have to agree with the others that this is what happens on a PvP server. Everything thinks it was going to be exactly how it was 15 years ago, and what we see today is far more extreme than it used to be.
---
&gt;He's not wrong though? Needing on items you'll never use is kind of a dick move. Those few gold in disenchant value can go quite far. Unless you were trying to make a Warlock Tank build work, of course.
---
Nobody else wanted the items so why would anyone care what kind of gear I want to wear?
---
&gt;Once again they aren't wrong. If someone is doing 200 dps while not dead, on dispel duty, or in any other way excused, they're just being lazy. Even ret paladins can do way better than that. If you refuse to put in the bare minimum of effort and want the other 39 to carry you, you're a dick.
---
As long as the content gets cleared, again, who cares?
---
gms already stepping in about the mc at fps, so there you go. but the whining of people on this reddit that didn't reach 60 before p2 is endless, these players didn't belong on a pvp server in the first place but they are spinning this self fulfilling prophecy none the less. i know you can't really trust the census addon, but our server was balanced when honor released, right now we are at 67/43 in favor of horde, with the active ganking guilds on alliance side... like wtf?  
---
either your side is so toxic that people rather stop logging in or the alliance pr of how bad it is, is working to well.
---
That would mean 1 crit is only worth 7.5 spell power.
---
1 spellpower is worth 6 int, as 1 crit is typically considered worth 10 spellpower for a frost mage.
---
This doesn't exist. All require you to scan and then use those scans to make decisions. No1 looking to game the AH is going to public share their own scans.

---
We've had more Mageblades drop than pieces of the T1 mage set (4 mageblades in 8 weeks). Not that I'm complaining, but it's just weird.
---
This just happened to my guild, Garr binding last week, and again this week. My first week of raiding Garr dropped his in a pug, seen it 3 times now, baron is a no show
---
hmmm interesting ill have to ask one of our tanks. all our MTs are BiS afaik and still use mitigation/sword and board (full consumes + word buffs as well always), if they could do it fury/prot DW w/mitigation gear or with threat gear idk why they wouldn't now.
---
Prot warr in DPS role be like
---
Gas bubble inside my eye to keep a piece of cornea in place.
---
Their fire dots also do a lot of damage, so FR helps mitigate that a bit as well.
---
Lol this made me laugh way harder than expected.
---
There’s no guards in Morgan’s vigil, it’s camped so that you make basically 0 progress or they Mc and run you back do you actually make negative progress.
---
Hmm. Guess thats a change they made. In vanilla i remember pally/sham gear dropping to opposite faction
---
I said "i think" and ended the sentence with a "?" never said you were upset with my logic lol just wondering why you would tell me who cares for no reason. It's all good tho you don't have to answer it.
---
you can just get rid of that spam if you want.
---
Horde are being absolutely farmed on ZT mate, it's no joke
---
Argent Dawn is the center of online RP universe. Never found anything like it on other games. Anywhere you walk in has RP happening.
---
Ive missed it
---
Unless im messing a ton of quests in there but theres really at most just 2 quests for Horde. The compedium one in the Library and the one that requires you to kill 4 bosses.
---
The "I don't have enough mana" spam can be disabled.
---
System -&gt; Sound -&gt; Disable 'Error Speech' - enjoy game sounds without spam from your character.
---
I would remove all PvP rewards, you do it because you like PvP thats it.
---
Same thing happened with our tank. Got the left bindings one week and the right bindings the next.
---
Are you unhappy for being nothing than walking and occasionally talking honor to them?
---
As a horde player on ZT I can confirm this. Most nights since P2 launch I've had to wait for 30 - 45 minutes to start a UBRS or BRD run just because people have to corpsehop to the instance porta...
---
In early maps we can see they changed Dire Maul's location multiple time
---
It was first planned to be nearby aerie peak   [https://i.imgur.com/iUSvzwG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/iUSvzwG.jpg)
---
and then in thousand needles [https://i.imgur.com/658VSuE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/658VSuE.jpg)   they had no idea where to put it lol
---
But we can see that feralas has a lvl 30/40 level range in the picture above, imo it was already moved to feralas in 2003

trailer for a live action short movie, wich shalllead to more short movies ;)

Something fishy is going on with Honor/ reset for yesterday and today. Not only did I receive 1k less for Tuesday than projected by honorspy (It's been rather accurate) but yesterday's majority of kills are being counted as today's, and I have received a fraction of the points. A few of my cohorts are having the same issues. Anyone have any info or a blue post on this?
---
I don't think so. I have ambient sounds disabled and I still hear it.
---
I feel you. It may have had more hp at some point but Idnr. It's a great vanity trinket but it lacks any stats that make it op, in my opinion.
---
I’ll admit I feel remorse, but ever since I started multiboxing, people make it a point to whisper bullshit at me.  Calling me a cheater, saying “you’re reported”.  It’s fucking stupid.  I have no tolerance for it anymore.
---
I’ve had the blades for like three weeks, and did not now which one to go with. At first I was always using the ones with higher DPS, but thanks to kind people here who aren’t complete assholes, I now know there is much more important things to worry about like swing time. BTW... this is my first time playing WOW, not everyone knows all of this shit.
---
I mean people watch Staysafe farm Mara for hours. Some people just enjoy the streamer and are fine with chatting and listening. Granted, I’m sure the two communities are both very different, so mileage may vary for each streamer.
---
So if you punch me in the face and I say, dude you should stop punching me in the face or I'm going to call the cops.. then you punch me in the face again and get arrested...  Don't make like I'm  the reason you got arrested.  I told you I was going to call the cops and you decided to continue the bad behavior.
---
A lot of people in this thread are blaming Asmon for why he got banned and I was saying that Asmon tried to warn the guy against the behavior so maybe we shouldn't blame Asmon for the ban.
---
And in doing so, you've directly contributed to the very problem you're complaining about in this post. It should come as no surprise that people would be unsympathetic about how little fun you're having trying to pvp when the other side is having even less fun no matter what they try doing.
---
that's no even half the price of an armor dude!
---
An it have been done by volonteers yes !
---
Follow-up question: what is generally considered a reasonable price for these summons?
---
Yeah, WoW went from "the guys with capes and swords" to Avengers Endgame
---
Horde racials too strong, but good joke :)
---
KSSHHHHHHOOOOOOOUUUUUUUVVVVVVVVVVVUUUUUUUUUVUVUUUUUUVUUUWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBVVVVVVVVVVVVRRRRRRROOO
---
I've found the opposite and had mostly nothing but positive experiences on Hydraxian.  Stay hydrated!
---
No those are just fees, Crusader mats go for 60g+-
---
This enchant is probably around 50% of my total income on fees but it requires a heavy investment either by farming or paying 200g for it and then ofcourse you need the Arcanite Rod to be able to enchant it so that's another 220g+-.
---
Enchanting isn't exactly recommended for newer players because it's a big moneysink before it becomes profitable. I think I spend about 1000g on recipes and would drop another 1k for the 4stats enchant. I'm sure I made that back with fees but I'm not exactly raking it in. I was banking on getting a MC recipe early, was 60 in the 2nd week but I've only seen 1 drop in all my runs. 
---
If I didn't have my reputation with Thorium/Timbermaw fixed I would have dropped it for a gathering profession.
---
haha yah it does depend on where you are, but for me that adds to it feeling like PvP. There are controlled areas, but you can sometimes get help with them. And things shift depending on the time of day. For example DO NOT try to travel on the boat between Ratchet and Booty Bay at around 12PM EST
---
I don't understand this fanboyism towards playing on "official servers". We had all of this previously on "unofficial servers", which had better GM support, better performance, and a community that was one of the best that I've ever seen in an MMO.
---
We have had Mc on farm for 8 weeks and our hunters just stopped using serpent sting as tanks run in. I beat 2 mages as moonkin on golemagg in greens. People either press the wrong button or don't spam between casts.
---
For me the biggest upside for classic wow it is that is the only mmorpg that i know that dont have in game purchases, that for me is the principal reason to me play classic wow over others mmos.
---
Bullshit. I know I spent 45+ min. I'll make sure to time it/record next time I go to bed for you.

If you didnt care then why reply :)

If they can spam their venting posts then so can we.

Waiting to go through Scholomance portal when people keep triggering the door opener...
---
haha that was fun! Another!
---
Deviate delight us to dead I barely run into people who RP and tbh it catches me off guard alot
---
I started leveling my rogue in combat too, but it felt pretty boring, so I've switched to sub and I'm having so much more fun: I can use stealth more frequently and efficiently, it feels like I'm playing an actual rogue and not just some edgy warrior. Also it feels so good to take away 50% of enemy's HP with one ambush crit.  PvP is super fun too.
---
If you didnt care then why did you reply to my reply bro.
---
I have a 46 rogue, 40 priest, 50 war, 40 shaman and 60 lock and I can say that the lock feels the best in most parts of the game. You have so many op aspects to you, like 3 different fears (one that lasts 20 seconds), pets that can give you huge shields, anti magic pets, pets that can cc warriors while enraged, dots (which mean amazing spread pressure), huge aoe with hellfire or RoF, sustain with lifetap and drain life/mana, huge crits with shadowbolts, curses that reduce enemy resistances, healthstones, battle rez, summons and the ability to solo many dungeons. 
---
Asmongold said it best when he compared it to feeling like you are ten levels above anyone else.
---
They should add some of these in.
---
Most likely due to 1% chance to de into a blue shard or whatever.
---
A DEVASTATING BLOW
---
I just did this the other day and I was so not prepared
---
I'm stoked to be a healer this time round. Vanilla I was just a little squishy frost Mage, now as a healer I plan on finding a warrior and hugging them the whole time.
---
Okay so then you shouldn't be able to PvE at all, right?
---
This game isn't the best anything, you can't play a nostalgia simulator. Get over it.
---
Why you still replying fam?
---
If you're leaving it at only +5, then you're right, not a whole lot of a point. Get a full set and you can pull down +10 or +15 for different skills. 
---
Let's say you can harvest Specialflower at 275 herbalism, but you only have 260 herbalism and are stuck picking Notsospecialflower, which is only green now and only gives you a level every other time you find one. Not to mention, the notsospecialflower doesn't even spawn in the area you're questing in anymore. Slap on your flower-picking set with +15 herbalism, and now you can keep questing and farming resources in that area, leveling up your herbalism faster, and making more money. 
---
That's 15-20 fewer nodes you need to harvest before moving up into a bracket that will help you level *and* make you more money. That's quite a lot.
---
You can *bear* the burden of playing Resto then.
---
I have the name you back in vanilla and boy it was fun needing on items and thinking they won , I still have the name on retail :) not as fun as before
---
I would be okay with BC if there were no flying mounts.
---
Yeah this is what people don't understand when they tell people to just re-roll. It's not like retail where there is enough quests to get you to 60- you have to grind the same mobs over again, meticulously save your 100g, and grind the same low level dungeons. It's fun the first time around because you're taking pride in your character. It's so demoralizing to do that all over again while you know you've got a 50ish character sitting in an inn somewhere.
---
Im not your fam dude
---
Thank you for this, now I'm deep into those old pictures again. Time to spend the next few hours laughing my ass off while everyone assumes I'm just that crazy cousin!
---
You must have played alliance and also ignored the quests in Gadgetzan that eventually lead to Un goro and then back to Darnassus. There were many quests for Horde that started around level 20 in the Barrens.
---
Not undead just trying to help :)
---
What they should do and what they actually do is two different things.
---
why not just, spirit rez.
---
So you think it’s wrong but you also think nothing should happen? Lol
---
RP-PvP actually stands for Resonably Populated PvP, I thought everyone knew? :)
---
My guild uses 1, he does more than enough and the mages love him. For MC at least I see no reason to not use a boomkin, unless you're aiming for super fast clear times or if most of your Pure classes aren't pulling their weight.
---
I’m gonna have to agree that people talking up PvP servers to players who clearly don’t want to be in an environment where you are likely to be killed in any popular zone is unfortunate. Lots of bad advice on this sub. Earlier in the sub’s history it was pretty dominated by p server players and had kind of an elitist attitude, but at least it full of correct information about the meta game. Near classic release it got kind of popular and filled with people who quite ironically think they wanted something but now realize they don’t.
---
True, but you never get the deserved recognition.
---
What are you hoping to accomplish with the thousandth or so thread on this shit? BGs are coming in just over a week, we get it, you're being camped, it was kind of funny at first but now its just old.
---
Yes, I can agree to it. Alliance leveling experience is way better lore-wise and their pve situation is better but that's it.
---
Yeah you wanna use the third option. Don't know if there's a shortcut for it, but it turns off weather noise and stuff. It's in system-&gt;sound.
---
When I said that I don't remember it, I was talking about the chat command that turns off the visual effects.
---
Probably your internet connection.
---
So i challenged myself today and the fastest time from zoning in -&gt; mining the vein, 13min36sec
---
With 0 death aswell
---
The only part of BC that should be added is the races and the mainland content.
---
So our fastest time for this was just over two minutes, we only had 28 dps total, and most were  melee in bis gear with not much ranged dps
---
I said i have fps lag. My internet is 500 up 500 down
---
Pecan.
---
I spend most of my days and nights wandering Ironforge. Only recently have I wandered the world.
---
We have 1. His personal dps is garbage if the fight lasts over 75 seconds but the mages love him and kind of fight to be in his group
---
Tanks are in high demand - you might want to reconsider if you want to go for a mc slot in a guild. Fury warriors are a dime a dozent, seriously. Out of 7 RL friends 3 rolled a fury warrior and 2 a mage.
---
The only people spamming are the ones complaining about PVP happening
---
Yes. "Experience or Honor". Thats the same tooltip on a lock's drain soul. If spirit tap didn't work then us locks wouldn't be able to gain soul shards.
---
Everything is the community fault and Blizzard was well aware of this.
---
&gt; So what you think I'm suppose to do? Just not pvp?
---
A familiar sentiment. The more productive response here is that you'd probably be doing everyone a favor by moving around every once and a while instead of turning the entirety of endgame content into an unavoidable gauntlet of misery for everyone involved. It's not optimal honor per hour, but that seems like a pretty small sacrifice in order to avoid one faction feeling like literal quest mobs every time they need to go somewhere. 
---
That said, I do think faction transfers are a good idea; especially as everyone who transfers already knows what the situation looks like. It's a far sight better than Blizz's current strategy of weakly dicking around with server transfers when there's every indication it's been making things worse.
---
Last I saw he was banned temporarily dropping a homophobic slur back in August.
---
As long as they all have to pay for a sub nothing will happen.
---
I like the strath service gate, KUNK-KUNK-CHUNK
---
*looks up from killing the Sha of Anger every week since 2013* 
---
 What?
---
&gt;Iirc the cap is 15k instead of the 3-4k in vanilla.
---
Mind showing me your source for it?
---
And this is the exact reason Blizzard wont give PvE transfers. They're terrified it's going to solidify unbalanced servers and way overpopulate the few PvE servers that are available.
---
/console set weatherdensity 0 
---
From a quick google search, but no promises of results as i cant currently test it
---
Also seems to be a setting in the WTF folder under the following:
---
SET weatherDensity
---
What’s your CPU look like when your stream is on
---
Pre-raid daggers aren't very good, but the swords are. You can definitely PvP effectively with dal'rends or krol blade and a hemo spec
---
We've got 4 in a row lol
---
That's correct, just download elvui, then download benikui from twitch app
---
This is how siblings fight, you sure you ain’t brothers?
---
This. It happens on other servers too, on mine FPs and chokepoints are constantly camped by 3-5 5man alliance parties. How do you beat that!? You actually play the game and talk to your guild and world chat to fight them off.
---
People here would just rather bitch than do anything about it.
---
this makes me wanna quit wow to protest blizzard more than hong kong lul
---
Let me walk you through this. YOU are the one bringing in a straw man argument about people too lazy to level up to prepare for the gangbang that is current world pvp as an attempt to discredit a reasonable objection to the style of play. You the complain about a downvote. Make your own fucking thread if you want to complain about the people who you, grand arbiter of who should be allowed on pvp servers, think are stupid.
---
I played on a pvp server at vanilla launch and engaged in small and large scale pvp throughout my leveling experience. I hoped to recreate that when classic launched so I picked a pvp server. I’m sure that’s what lots of people were thinking. What we got are predominately horde dominated pvp servers because of racial imbalances from classic and gank squads of people exploiting mechanics or swarming and camping. You’re telling me I don’t belong here? You can eat shit.
---
I get the feeling you are are so defensive about this because you LOVE the gangbang and know you’re too shitty to do it in a balanced setting.
---
To be clear, you can eat shit, go make your own thread if you want to complain about this.
---
big debate in my guild to switch to Deviate delight, go to real rp again and avoid this nightmare grobb is right now
---
I'm so happy I can teleport to moonglade. I just have my hearth stone permanently in ironforge. Never have to take a boat ever.
---
Yeah fuck him for wanting to to play the game right?
---
No those are Horde players
---
no it's bigglesworth, and ya the horde on that server are super potato and high in numbers, it's very fun
---
At this point, I think the only solution is faction specific queues in addition to an incentive to the non dominant faction to entice the dominant faction to reroll.
---
They could have made names unique across realms and greatly increased the number of realms so that it would be easy to merge into faction balanced servers once faction trends were apparent.
---
This is quality content.
---
What addon highlights the color of your gear? Your epic gear has a more distinct purple hue in the item slot.
---
Ony head neck is amazing for Feral tanks as well. Not as much mitigation as a Talisman of Evasion, but it has Stam, Agi, Hit, and Crit. All stats we need. But I do value hit a bit more than most for bear tanking it seems.
---
IM OUT OF MANA DAMN YOU
---
Farming this right now, how many beads did you have by the time you hit revered? I don't think I'll even have 1000 beads by revered (grouped a lot while farming rep, grave mistake), so I'll have to farm an extra ~1100 beads... welp, atleast I'm making a lot of gold
---
Give it a week and they will have nobody left to kill.
---
d o r f
---
I mean I feel attacked but, I'd take you.
---
Yeah, I love healing on my Shaman.  A well-placed heal feels a lot more devastating than getting kited and hoping for windfury procs.
---
A warrior with mana, a pet, and ranged abilities. Op!
---
I mean if you played during launch, which it doesn't sound like you did it was a shit show. They essentially doubled the available servers within the hour to spread people out. So people's plans went out the window when faced with 5000+ queues
---
Gotem
---
Other people playing the game don't need to cater to one person. That *is* stupid
---
Not sure what comment you’re supposed to be replying to, but in 1.12 shaman/Pali tier gear did not drop to the opposite faction. I think when they did the TBC pre-patch they changed it so that tier gear started dropping. But it shouldn’t happen in classic for a while.
---
Man Undercity, about 25 hours a day.

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8950/homemade-cherry-pie
---
Awesome advice. Thank you!! Thanks for watching
---
The damage one.
---
for my OH which one is better deadly kris of power 19 dps + 12 Attack power or  Knightly longsword of the bear 20 dps + 4 stam, 4+ strength ?
---
 Yes because leaving all your friends and guild because blizzard fucked up is definetely on player right.
---
Who wouldn't want to be a bear?  Hibernation, salmon, it's all good.
---
every time a new raid appears your odds of getting loot you want dramatically raises
---
I see we have come full circle, the only question  is what do I complain about now??
---
&gt;Server sizes are closer to pserver sizes (8-10k player on one server) than on classic (2.5k on a server).
---
Can I see your source for it please?
---
&gt;Not to mention that Horde has safe travel and guards on their airships with ranged noclip knockback goblins (thanks blizz) while all ally boats are contested zones, no guards on them, and even menethil only has lv40 nonelite guards.
---
That's correct. I think people was well aware of this and the consequences of this, right?
---
&gt;So all in all, alliance have it way worse than horde had in vanilla for multiple reasons
---
Alliance has it better in PVE and some certain BG favors (Alterac bridge yay) but wpvp it's definitely way weaker. People rolling for Alliance should be well aware of that.
---
Lol where did you get that base picture? /u/coke92
---
I didn't realize all these people who hit level 60 in a month and are in full T1/BIS gear were p2w whales. How else could they have gotten this easy-as-fuck-to-obtain-if-you-show-up-and-spam-frostbolt best-in-slot gear? And all the non p2w 60s are all too poor to afford basic consumables, let alone flasks or an epic mount. Thanks for your profound wisdom. This game is pay to win trash.
---
Are you clicking back into wow itself? (Background FPS setting?)
---
Longsword.
---
Isnt strat ud crossbow better?
---
Whose fault it is isnt really the point
---
No
---
Excellent and accurate depiction.
---
Sounds like a lot of people thought they did, but don't.
---
I was more asking why you thought it was a better source since I checked my server, Skeram, and both sites say the same thing 75/25 h:a for level 60s.
---
What happened to no changes? Convenient that it's already forgotten.
---
I dont think my cpu is the problem, everything looks fine
---
I don't normally say this, but if you dueled a person for 1 minute in one location that had no patrol guards, when you could have literally kited to a location with guards or civilians which would call guards for you. Then your just bad, and i'm so tired of these threads where people are like "im bad and being killed lol No ChAnGeS" your awful, like your actually awful, i know it sucks being bad but use your brain for a little bit before opening your mouth.
---
&gt;using healcomm which contains stolen code
---
libhealcomm4.0 gang
---
Aren't faction transfers a thing in retail?
---
Yeah I’ve seen the same thing happen for me. It will split some hk’s over separate days. Overall I’ve been getting the correct honor amount though.
---
Are we playing retail? Can alliance play shamans? can horde play paladins?
---
Tell me about the world brother. 
---
I have been locked in this Mountain Prison for weeks.
---
This! WTF! It's like blaming my Jew grandad from fleeing Europe doing WW2... Fricking asshole should've stayed and fought!
---
Uh wtf, you're a warlock. How do you need a explination of this? 
---
Warlock do big damage. Paladin tank do small damage and no hard taunt. Warlock get big crit and pull aggro. Paladin get no more hit with holy shield and do even less threat. Warlock tanking now.
---
Grobbulus.
---
The main reason I'm iffy about flying is the last one. Ganking is ganking, but when everyone is flying you end up just not really seeing anyone and pvp actually happens less. You'll only ever really be in danger if you are on the ground fighting or gathering, while travelling on your flying mount you are totally safe and it really changes the feeling of the game.
---
Yes, ive turned up background fps
---
I have leveled two characters recently to mid 30
---
Both warlocks
---
Alliance 
---
Pre30 very streamlined experience 
---
Switching back forth between dwarf/ human areas. 
---
I had a harder time knowing where to go as horde. 
---
Great lv 26 headgear quest for alliance 
---
Fellhunter is harder to get. 
---
A lot of class quest that goes to barren.  And is really messy, expect dying a few times going to the quest givers from ganking. 
---
Imp quest is a lot harder for human/gnome/orc compared to undead.  
---
Wailing caverns &amp; bfd &amp; sm is more accessible to horde.  
---
Boats is more problematic then airships 
---
Alliance menhil - if running is more time consuming then horde counterpart
---
Auction-ator, not auction-eer 
---
And no, that doesn't exist, you can only see prices that are scanned
---
Shut up Alex.
---
There are constructive ways to complain, this post is just whining and name calling because OP had their feelings hurt
---
If you're a gnome, specifically a gnome mage or rogue then I judge yours very heavily
---
just tired of seeing the same thread pop up 10 times a day. i can eat shit? just keep eating shit because you made a bad decision 3 months ago, or reroll, i don't really care and i don't really care about downvotes either or i would have deleted my comments earlier this day (like so man people on this site) but an instant downvote just tells me that there are people offended by my comment, because the truth fucking hurts, if you are having a bad time now, you made the wrong decision.
---
People will give up when they see how much time is actually required to get to rank 8+
---
I actually played in vanilla, from day 1. Alliance was the dominant faction.
---
horde kill ppl in the middle of alliance ciites all the time
---
even neutral towns
---
the only major disparity is that zepplins have guards and boats dont
---
the rest is similarly susceptible, but that horde often get the better bruiser guards
---
Clan Hammersong go hard on the RP and it's really fun to interact with them.
---
Loot?
---
That is why I play a holy paladin
---
In the right group you do. Anytime an enemy focuses you, everyone drops what they're doing to peel/murder the transgressor
---
Imagine thinking this is exclusively done by horde.  The factions mean nothing.
---
What are you even arguing about, casually nitpicking my comment with ignoring the vast majority of it? You said 60/40 is balanced, I say it isnt, i literally proved it isnt, you in essence even agreed with me with "yeah but everyone knew yadayada" and "horde racials yadayada". Like what is your point?
---
As for server sizes, blizz said their "low" servers gonna be larger than vanilla "full" servers, im at work and cba to google it for you, since quite clearly you are only here to argue for the sake of arguing.
---
Windows 10 has that built in now, so you don't need flux anymore. Works better for screenshots and such as they ignore the built in W10 filter but the yellow tint from flux will stay (or at least it did last I used it).
---
As a warrior you can be DPS, Tank or PvP specced.   Not being able to roll on loot cuz it would require a 1g cost is just stupid and nothing a skilled group leader would enforce. 
---
You didn't comment on my Bonereaver remark.
---
I'm about to start a Paladin alt. I'll level as Ret, but in BGs I'll go Holy, and I'll raid as Holy. Which race should I choose?
---
/cancelaura Ice Block  
---
/cast [nomod] Ice Block; [mod:alt] Frost Nova
---
Click once: ice block. Click twice or spam: cancel ice block/cast then immediately cancel; hold alt and click: cancel ice block if it's there + frost nova.
---
Nice.
---
Interesting! Didn't know about this
---
Yes it is absolutely fully-functional. I assume you mean "good", but no alternative is better
---
I believe it’s 10% decay through rank 12 and only 20% decay for ranks 13 and 14. That’s why the last two are so hard to achieve.
---
Wow Goblin Mortor  is a crazy PVP item, I can't believe I never knew about it before.
---
It’s called using consumables/engineering.
---
Um... Did you not see me skin and loot it?
---
I think because the majority are enjoying P2 even in it's current state. Just an anecdote here so I don't want it to be taken as matter of factly but on my server with a similar horde to alliance skew, more people are coming together than before. So many wpvp groups are coming together forming new friendships and fighting back. Dungeon groups rallying together to move as a unit through a horde controlled area and it's been a blast man. It's more player inclusive and immersive than ever before. 
---
What every server has in common is lobby warriors who lobby the chat channels and major cities, just whining and crying about not being able to min max and their time. Not being able to dungeon spam at the same rates or level at top tier efficiency. Travelling alone in high traffic areas thinking the 140th time will be different. I think everyone is just tired of them. 
---
Additionally something can be said for the type of player who doesn't make bonds with their guild and other players. You don't have to be a social butterfly to participate in how the game's been operating since the release of the honor system, but it's about to change drastically in 2 weeks anyways.
---
Wish I had my brother playing with me hahaja
---
You realize the content is super easy cause we're playing nerfed vanilla, and if they progress to tbc - it's probably going to be easy mode nerfed as well
---
The real problem with going shadow isn’t getting into raids but rather getting the tier gear that drops. Since you’re considered off spec the gear will almost always go to the healer priests unless they already have it
---
Dude didn't seem angry. Seemed like he was trying to help. Tone is hard to read over text
---
go play retail if flying is so great
---
I am always shocked when I see videos of people playing and they have error speech on. I always turn it off immediately at lvl 1
---
I've seen a total of 3 boomkins on my server. One was before I was at lvl 60. Then I saw a raid with 2. So it might have been actually just 2 boomkins. Each sighting was of alliance. I'm horde, but I haven't seen any on horde. If there was one on our server, they would probably become well known as the only horde boomkins.
---
then play retail, its available
---
Did something weird happen twitch or client side? My details and my taxi timer both stopped working and said the client was not the correct one. Despite keeping them updated through the twitch client and them working a the day previously just fine.
---
https://i.imgur.com/GF9hjfp.jpg
---
I play on pvp server to actually avoid it. It’s fun to avoid danger.
---
These things are all optional, you can do it any way you like. Usually people want to do the thing that is most efficient/fastest.
---
Yes I would say in a dungeon generally not to use rockbiter and earth shock. The reason is that these moves produce extra threat which might cause the enemy to turn away from the tank. Warriors/bears generate rage when they are hit and also have better armor than you, and also if you are being hit then your long cast spells would be slower and worse. You could earth shock to try to pull something off of a healer in an emergency, but most of the time it's probably better to just heal the healer if necessary, or somewhat ignore it to keep dpsing the enemy with lowest health, and wait for the tank to handle the threat. If you pull threat on an enemy, the tank might want to react, possibly by switching to defensive stance and taunting, which can be resist, or using mocking blow, which is not the most efficient use of rage, so it's cleaner not to cause that. The tank might also just ignore it and let you have threat, but you've then implicitly costed them some rage, and the healer some mana, since you don't mitigate as much as the tank.
---
When operating in a pair, I think you shouldn't rule out offspec things. For example, the balance talent omen of clarity is very good for cat form. I think it all really depends on the situation. If you are doing yellow/green quests, these are very easy for a pair of people and you are just rolling over enemies and you want to keep moving. I think if you use ranged magic together you will kill anything before it gets to you. I think you shouldn't stop to drink, if you run out of mana, then engage in melee and wait for the spirit regen.
---
Spirit regen only occurs after you haven't casted for 5 seconds and is interrupted when you complete a cast again. I think this is the best answer to your last question. You should usually avoid interrupting your spirit regen. This mechanic will determine a lot of your rotations and spell choices. You want to bunch up your casts, and then after five seconds when your mana begins to regen, you want to avoid interrupting it. So, for shocks, this means you can cast a shock on cooldown, only if you have also been doing other casts (totems, lightning bolts.)
---
So, yea, I think with pairings like this you can feel it out and find things that most of the community won't know. You don't necessarily have to hold aggro off of the druid especially if it feels inefficient to do so., since they have bear or cat form. I don't know what strategy is optimal for that composition but I did want to mention the above things.
---
I liked searing totem and stoneskin as a shaman, but I think when questing as a pair, totems may sometimes be not as good, since enemies will die so quickly. Not sure the answer to that question, but as I said, you can try lightning bolts as well even if you don't have the talents.
---
I am playing a priest with a warrior friend and we are trying to beat dungeons ourselves. We were able to do most of WC. Lord Pythas was hard as he is with two other enemies. The really sticky glue was helpful. This is not the fastest way to level though, at least not the way we're doing it. You could try this - fighting elites, dropping totems, and healing the bear - sounds pretty fun. SFK or BFD likely. In this case you should use all the totems, but against non-elites, I think you would clear too much space too fast, and the fights are shorter, reducing the effect of most totems, and the time you have to drop them.
---
Ya i am ok to do it since it seems most people dont want to/dont commit to it.  I am okay with the money sink now, its mostly for fun!
---
Yes, it is.
---
Im Alliance in ZT so IKR
---
Not related to Classic.
---
Repeating, of course.
---
I saw a guy you targetted skinning then you detargeted him so I assumed it completed.  Maybe the small video preview and my shitty eyesight betrayed me?
---
I did see you pop a bubble, did you skin from within that?  If so, my hat's off to you instead.
---
The guy who was camping him has multiple videos of him being camped by asmon’s goons
---
Tsm and Booty bay gazette. Find them both on curses website.
---
ya in all irony, blizzard of all people not being the ones with a cash shop is genuinely shocking
---
I mean if you're a gnome warrior you're ugly, annoying, and a waste of space but at least you're not a human warrior like the other 97.69% of ally warriors so you somewhat get a pass
---
Your logic was wrong too.
---
Also the amount of time required to play.
---
/who Waldo
---
You lose at 1v1 and get camped, you actually have few options. One is to log to your alt, another is to accept faith and run the distance in 12 times. Or the best option, you ask for your party to come rescue you and camp the other player.
---
&gt;no counterargument
---
&gt;"jUsT Go pLaY rEtAiL!!"

Very constructive post.
---
*gasp*! Acceptance!
---
I honestly can't wait for Bgs so I can go back to PvP healer. WPvP sucks as a healer unless I'm grouped and it all huge raid groups so the honor is garbage. So I had to go shadow until BGs come out but it worked out because now I can farm Mara for a bit and hopefully get my epic mount soon. Also wPvP without an epic mount suuuuuuucks haha
---
Thanks so much!
---
u/Hypercamp was trying to problem solve your issue. You didn’t answer his question about the CPU. I’m not sure if your reply’s were meant to read in the snide tone that I interpreted them in.
---
I can imagine several ways faction transfers can work. Disallowing faction specific classes to transfer is one. Allowing faction specific classes to change to the opposing factions faction specific class is another. And, no, you're the worst kind of person. You sound pretty mad, bro. Why so devastated?
---
5 points into wand spec is probably just as important for leveling a priest.  The DPS from a wand should not be overlooked.
---
I mean i feel the same way about alliance as horde on grob. It goes both ways.
---

Imagine being so much of a pathetic neckbeard that a fantasy rivalry, that exists only in a video game, has somehow transcended into somebody's actual thoughts and feelings about an actual human who plays the same video game.
---
and boomies buff mages. still doesn't mean they are doing much... this is coming from a druid mind you.
---
As a warrior I feel obligated to tell you to respec to holy and forget about dps.

wait i thought this wasn't gatherable until phase 5 what?
---
&gt; Horde have every advantage in world PvP
---
Have you met paladins before?
---
10/10 always dreamed of a set up like this, brilliant.
---
Guards are same everywhere just ppl abusing safe spots in Goblin towns. In cities like IF guard have aggro range just like normal mobs so if you arent close to them they are dumb and don't react.They always do attack once you are in their threat range
---
Go back to retail then.
---
They're in High demand in dungeons. Any serious Guild has its tank slots filled, warrior Fury on the other hand are S tier, plenty of spots for them.
---
Compared to Priests and Paladins yes, you will want to prioritize mp5 on encounters that take longer than about 90 seconds where consumables will easily carry you through. I don’t know if I’d call it a “problem” though, you just build a spell power set and a mp5 set for when you need either, and downrank heals accordingly. Ultimately there is no situation where a Shaman simply can’t regenerate enough mana to kill bosses so it’s kind of disingenuous for people to say they have mana problems, you just have to prioritize regen more than others.
---
Also it’s a little disingenuous to call them “amazing” healers. Priests are amazing healers. Shamans are good healers that bring a lot of utility to the group, primarily for melee DPS groups. Chain Heal sounds OP but there are very few encounters where you actually need to spam aoe heal otherwise Alliance guilds would be fucked (and they’re obviously not). In equal gear and not having to dispel a priest will always out heal you but you’re not there just to heal, you’re there to heal while providing your group more damage. Quite frankly if WF totem didn’t exist you would never prefer a Shaman over a Priest.
---
That's what happens when you try to get into Deadmines as Horde.
---
He would have seen all 9 classes out in the wild, not just pallies
---
You mean like the idiot assuming that 8k hp and SL is something a lot of locks do for AQ? 2 of them, at most. And they are TANKS. Nobody uses SL in AQ unless their dps is garbage or they are tanking. You crushed your own strawman argument. Congrats, moron.
---
Depends on your guild, if you're clearing Ony with 40 people chances are that viskag and Deathbringer will always go to another higher performing player.
---
If you're doing 20 man splits youll have 2x the chance at getting it.
---
Come on man, if you wanted to complain about the lack of RP you’re free to, but why make a photoshop of an obviously afk player?  What, did they type so fast that both chat bubbles were in the air, despite their mouth being motionless while yours is still talking, despite you needing to speak first?
---
1-800-Come-On-Now
---
&gt; We get to play the original World of Warcraft again.
---
Except it isn't.  #nochanges doesn't exist.  Blizzard has made extremely fundamental changes that have completely changed this game.
---
Private servers were a better recreation of vanilla.
---
&gt; vanilla has been legitimized with official servers
---
Unless they provide an experience that is better than what private servers did, I don't know how much this matters.
---
Blizzard has fucked this game up completely, the game is dying, and they do nothing.  It's incredibly frustrating.
---
Thanks! You'll get there man :) better to take your time and enjoy - where you up to?
---
&gt; 400% epic flying mount
---
Epic flying in TBC is 270% speed.
---
You can't "run away" from someone on an epic ground mount either, really, unless you have epic flying yourself.
---
&gt;They can stay as high as they want and grief people
---
....so the moment they dismount to attack someone, go attack them? What's the problem here? This """"""griefing""""""""""" you're describing is literally no different than people on regular ground mounts doing it in vanilla.
---
&gt;the moment anyone is out of combat they can escape pvp if they choose
---
Flying mounts still have a 3 second cast time just like any other mount. It's not the game's problem that you're too slow.
---
&gt;it actually just kills the world
---
Being able to travel a little faster doesn't "kill the world". The main gameplay content is still on the ground. Flying is literally just for travel.
---
&gt;No class is better at surviving PvP. Few classes are worse at winning PvP.
---
This is the perfect description of the druid PVP experience.
---
Begrudging tolerance, very different from acceptance. Gnomes are a blight upon Azeroth. When I was levelling my two toons I would always kill and camp every gnome I came across.
---
Its funny how a 200 ping European private server feels better than my 40 ping official server
---
Your first point: “Hey is your guild looking to faction change, well guess what none of you shamans can come with us, fuck you guys” 
---
Your second point “I see you have all this gear to play this class, let me make you play a different class and all that gear you spent time and money in is now worthless, enjoy your new faction” 
---
Blizzard would never do this, you have to bring up solutions that are plausible. With your logic why doesn’t blizzard just force balanced servers by making people transfer against their will?  Your “solutions” are literally not possible.
---
Transferred yesterday, but that was from EU server. See no reason why it shouldn't be so on us servers, tho.
---
I wasnt trying to be rude or anything like that. I appreciate him trying to help me out. Ive already checked if my components is acting up. And my english is shit, so i dont know if i responded rude or not
---
Nice! :P We beat the submerge timer by 2.5 seconds haha! My weapons broke at 11% lol, fortunately I had spares in my bank and managed to swap them out quickly!
---
We're just stuck on Rag right now. Need more GFPs, it seems, and more DPS.
---
It only seems that unbalanced because your end game horde are all camping people that don't give them honor due to them being so low or camping the menethil boat. 
---
If they hung around their level areas and fought back, you'd realize the server was a lot more balanced than you think it is.
---
Yeah ofc. Watching my mana in the process though
---
Undercity??
---
*watch your ankles son*
---
then they're sound effects you can lower those two but will hear less your spells and such...
---
Because expansion expands upon an existing game and Classic is technically just a a rerelease of a game that existed, not an expansion. But it’s easier to just refer to it as an expansion some times hence why I used that word
---
So knowing that onyxia will reset on Sunday. If I am getting home late Saturday what time do I need to be inside in order to be able to run on Saturday and Sunday?
---
I know what you mean and checked it out although i didnt made any adjustments personally. As far as i could tell, the addon comes with some prices for enchanting mats preloaded. These are all inaccurate and should be adjusted (manually) to your servers auction house prices.
---
Then it will give you a reliable calculation based on the average disenchant value.
---
If it's not an LED projector, that bulbs gonna be fried soon.
---
We didn’t do anything!
---
This guy literally just said “leveling to 60” and agreed with the previous comment about twink pvp. He’s saying it’s a massive waste in every other play type.
---
cheesy enought ? 
---

---
I waited 40 minutes the first 3 days on Atiesh and then never had a queue again.
---
If you think that’s the only thing making it seem 70/30 you couldn’t be any further from the truth. As I stated people are sitting in cities and farming dungeons because they are massively overwhelmed everywhere they go. Play a server like Herod on alliance for even five minutes and I guarantee you’d understand much better how unbalanced it is.
---
How do I set my pet's abilities to manual? Google hasn't been very helpful because everything is related to some bug that happened in BFA lol
---
I'm not saying the game is pay2win get some fucking read comprehension my dude. I am saying that the game is otherwise a non pay2win game with the exception of multiboxing which is a huge pay2win aspect, which is why I want it removed to keep the purity of classic as a non pay2win game..
---
It isn't my job to sort out the logistical issues with faction transfers, but I have no doubt it's possible. It might not be fair, but if a Shaman is desperate to transfer to the other faction, odds are good he'd have to take a major hit on gear.
---
Healer or tank if you want groups
---
You can still PVP in PVE servers. You can just turn it of instead of getting corpse camped.
---
&gt; No more 5+ crashes per day.
---
Instead you get random disconnects and the laggiest lag that ever lagged in large wpvp fights.
---
&gt; No more broken/buggy scripting.
---
Haha, what?  There's tons of bugs in Classic.
---
&gt; No more gold spammers.
---
What?  I get spammed daily.
---
&gt; No more 200 latency because of the server being on the other side of the world.
---
Yeah, instead you get 10,000 latency when more than 40 people are in the same area.
---
&gt; No more half the server being chinese farmers/botters
---
There's lots of bots in Classic.
---
&gt; No more arguments over whether or not something is "blizzlike"
---
We're still arguing about it.
---
Right! Awesome thanks for the clarification :)
---
You chose to roll on a PvP server. Suck it up or reroll PvE.
---
If you're already threat capping, you don't have to do anything.
---
I wouldn't worry about improving hit chance for the offhand, the same logic applies here as it does for the normal penalty to offhand hit chance - don't worry about it. You'll get more dps stacking crit and attack power.
---
If you do want more dps, Brutality Blade is a better mainhand than Axe of the Deep Woods, and it would be more dps to use Brutality Blade MH with Edgemaster's Handguards.
---
It's strange how much durability it costs to run MC, didn't die and my dagger was at 30/60 after we were done
---
They are but that's because all classes are available to all factions now. Even most of the race restrictions for classes are gone now.
---
Lol I'm still level 55 - gz on 60 👍
---
Right click it so the flashing lights go away
---
I’m fine with that but at least stop naming your stupid ass characters PickleRick and shit
---
its always the undead rogues
---
Preach.
---
These never stop, do they😅
---
Yeah. Waterfalls, torches etc. are part of the "normal" sounds like spells and attacks. A bit annoying really. I like having sound on but torches are unbearable, so I play almost muted.
---
Spoken like an alliance
---
&gt;You said 60/40 is balanced
---
It's not balanced from the absolute perspective but it's balanced for classic. People were bound to roll more horde for reasons I have mentioned. People who aren't ready to stomach 60/40 should either roll horde for the sake of playing dominating faction or straight go to retail since these issues aren't there.
---
My point is you emphasize on a certain value of  8-10k player on one server which is the cornerstone of your reasoning. Your issue is, this cornerstone is highly likely to be incorrect, this is why I ask where have you taken this value. There is absolutely no need for you to google it, since blizzard have said at about servers at launch with a certain amount of layers introduced with each layer being roughly equal to one vanilla server in terms of player concurrent online capacity. More layers, more people. The fact you don't pay attention to is we don't have any layers (as in we have 1 layer per server) right now but the same fact about 1 layer being roughly equal to vanilla server cap (being more indeed but nowhere close to the values you have provided).
---
So I ask you again: what's your actual source for the 8-10k value?
---
/r/earrumblersassemble
---
Why does everyone hate that guy? Im out of the loop when it comes to whatever drama he was caught up in
---
Any advantage paladins give is easily negated by Horde having much better PvP racials overall, especially now that everyone has PvP trinkets. 
---
You won't miss paladins when you have a good shaman on your team, shocks and smart totem usage is a very powerful tool, don't let the hive mind of shitty pvpers convince you pallies are that great
---
Alright, I shall try to do more of the same. Thanks for taking the time to give me a detailed response. Appreciate it!
---
I already have questionable amounts spent in it and I enjoy every minute!
---
You seem like the type of person to make a big fuss and provide 0 actual help. You seem to want this faction transfer for yourself and not give a fuck about how it would work for anyone else. When blizzard does something they take into fsct the population as a whole, not because you are angry. And also having seen your username I’m not surprised lol
---
Going there now!
---
We've gotten 10 Ancient Petrified Leafs in a row. Lord help our priests.
---
I know who just volunteered to escort me during my farming run then.
---
Oh this is something I have no clue about then, sorry.
---
If you release then log out, and log back in after the boat leaves you will rez without sickness where your ghost was.  Learned this after being farmed on the org zep.
---
If you’re shadow you don’t really want the gear anyway, usually. You roll for generic caster stuff, not your tier pieces.
---
Which is all I really expect from people but evidently we can’t even have that.
---
&gt; Nobody likes your awesome Night Elf Hunter that you earnestly believe isn't a Legolas ripoff because it so obviously is to an outsider. Nobody likes your Disco-Dancing Footman human warrior, despite the Human /dance animation and the bonus track from Warcraft 2 being a thing.
---
I think a lot of this comes down to how you sell it. Don't make a Legolas (or, worse, a Drizzt) ripoff, sure, but there's nothing wrong with saying your hunter is an exceptional marksman - particularly if that's how s/he's spec'd. Alternatively, say your human warrior wants to join the Stormwind army and so behaves like he expects a footman would, but he also enjoys dancing like a fool in his downtime. Just keep from overtly mentioning anything about disco and I think that's a pretty solid character concept.
---
&gt; Nobody will accept your character's in-game activities, like slaying Onyxia, putting Ragnaros down, slaughtering the Quillboar, slaying demons in Felwood, etc.
---
I don't see anything wrong with the latter two. Fighting quillboars and demons is standard adventuring fare, nothing special about it. As for the former, again, it's all in how you sell it. I wouldn't claim to have slain Onyxia on any of my characters, but I might say I was part of an excursion into her lair that managed to wound her and take her out of commission for a short time. Similarly with Ragnaros, we didn't banish him back to the Plane of Fire, but maybe we managed to disrupt the magics tethering him to this world to some extent.
---
&gt; horde
---
I have x2 60 hunters and a level 47 hunter.
---
End game is what you make of it. For me it was starting a new character.
---
It is exceedingly important every raid has 1 boomkin for one main reason, and that is for morale. 
---
Also because he will be geared faster than any other spot in your raid. Also MC isn't hard fuck it I just like seeing a boomkin.
---
Yes of course but it’s good to have it anyways when you eventually switch to holy for the next releases raid
---
The worst offender in my opinion is the spider hatchling pet, holy fuck. A creature that small would probably be crushed by the pressure of the sound waves created as it skitters around.
---
This exactly, I never at any point while leveling got murdered over and over again by rampaging death squads.
---
Don't forget the undead mages and undead locks.
---
Classy hunter, farm excalted 2h in pulling every mob in the area
---
The fact that anyone thinks this was being presented as a real screenshot is mind boggling.
---
I do my best to be as little as a burden as I can, I try go for pvpers but they are mostly in groups, I do hillsbrad and raid IF a lot, or gank people quite close to GY's and leave them alone when they aren't worth much. but yeah getting ganked obviously sucks no matter what
---
Motherfucker you just verbally pulled out the crayons on his ass.
---
Dig around in Nvidia and change your desktop resolution.
---
this patch has made me feel incredibly vindicated for quitting, and i'm horde on skeram
---
&gt; Instead you get random disconnects and the laggiest lag that ever lagged in large wpvp fights.
---
I've never gotten a single "random disconnect" in Classic. And I'm not on a streamer server so there's no lag in large wpvp fights.
---
&gt;Haha, what? There's tons of bugs in Classic.
---
I said "scripting". I never claimed there's no bugs in classic. Even those bugs that do exist are FAR less severe than the broken shit on pservers, like entire quests just straight-up not working.
---
&gt;What? I get spammed daily.
---
I get one, maybe two chat channel invites per day, but they are entirely blocked by the interface options.
---
Unlike on pservers where you'd get 20+ whispers an hour, and every single major city would have spambots running around spamming gold advertisements in /say and /yell, on top of the chat channel invites, as well as spambots inviting people to a raid and spamming their messages in raid chat.
---
&gt;Yeah, instead you get 10,000 latency when more than 40 people are in the same area.
---
Maybe stop playing on the hyper-populated streamer servers and you won't lag.
---
&gt;There's lots of bots in Classic.
---
Keywords: half the server
---
&gt;I'm* still arguing about it.
---
ftfy
---
It’s more useful now since you actually can’t really solo anything so you really need the groups. Stop acting like a 30 min delay in getting to a dungeon is “unplayable.” So fucking dramatic. You play on a PvP server.
---
You think you can just PvP on a PvP server with all the PvP happening when you’re just trying to PvP?
---
Np man, ive done more research, could have something to do with my monitors having different refresh rate
---
I bless the rains down in straaaaaanglethorn
---
Absolutely!
---
Not answering the questions who shows that youre totally stupid, going straight to the point without argument and logic, murican for sure...
---
This is not how it works baby. So if im wrong, can you explain why ?
---
It’s not really nerfed, just that itemization isn’t horrible and class talent trees work for the most part. BC didn’t have remotely the same disparity from start to finish. Nice attempt to condescend I guess though.
---
Thank you very much :D
---
The thing is OP is asking about alliance SP, which means the first Fear is mostly useless so the UD rogue will stick on you a lot more than if playing Horde.
---
But shadow priests can heal whilst melting faces
---
What am I missing as a hunter trying to PVP? I basically get my ass handed to me unless I get the jump on them
---
Scares the shit out of me when im autorunning past it
---
I just wish reporting them did anything. I love Grobb other than that exact thing.
---
My guild groups up at IF flight path and then travels as a group to both MC and onyxia.  Problem solved
---
Honorspy addon! The most recent update implements that, pretty useful
---
But I want to be the Disco-dancing Footman who does the Quests and is the character I'm playing in the game, not some socially-whitewashed character who exists adjacent to it.
---
I have no interest in faction transferring. I'm happy with my new server.
---
&gt; I was so not prepared
---
We don't have that expansion, yet.
---
Try changing instance ID periodically by having a person who hasn't yet been party leader send out invites and be the first to enter. It's far-fetched, but it's all I've got.
---
That's a druid weapon fam
---
Youre better than a great many others, then. I signed up knowing id get ganked a lot, but the thought that theres a repetitive 30m slog required for anything i want to do is the inspiration for my saltposting.
---
I originally said faction based transfer aren’t possible and showed you why. Then you literally said “even if it’s not possible, blizzard should do it”. Like what??
---
Bullshit... you have 7 minutes for the first 7 bosses, 2 minutes for rag, domo talks for like 3. That leaves 12 minutes for trash and running all the way through the instance. You are full of it.
---
Yet, just a year ago almost everyone here was saying that this is what world pvp is.
---
How times have changed.
---
Easy, Faction queues... and dare I say Faction Changes.
---
I absolutely agree. I understand the mood lately here has been all doom and gloom but I’m still having a blast playing on my alt. I decided I don’t care as much as most to completely min/max everything and would rather go for flavor. I rolled an undead warlock and decided to take up alchemy and tailoring for that Grand Apothecary Putress vibe and I’m having a blast in the open world so far. I started in wrath and have always maimed a warlock but now I get to experience my all time favorite class in its original design, while also role playing a bit even if it is for myself. I completely understand there are legitimate issues right now all over the board, but I’m still having fun. Luckily I feel my server, although leaning heavily towards horde, still has a healthy balance of open world PvP. At least in the zones I’ve been in so far. I had so much fun trading kills last night in Hillsbrad with a rogue and Druid/priest combo and having both of us get our own guild members involved.
---
There will always be problems with the game. I get it. But I’m having fun still and to me that’s worth my money.
---
Only in patch 2.0.  (The burning crusade pre patch)
---
Fwiw the current fastest clear uses a boomkin. Though it is mostly for faerie fire and gotw since resto druids aren’t great in an environment where buff slots are tight.
---
I like how you censored the names but you can see it was Gai on Herod who was spineless.
---
Not a very big difference between the two. Stoneform can be nice in some pvp situations for bleed immunity. Other than that, dwarves don't have much going for them as far as racials go (find treasure can be nice for solo dungeon gold farming). Humans get +mace and sword skill, which will not benefit you much if you're not raiding as ret. Stacking hit isn't necessary for PvP, but having a little extra won't hurt either. Humans also get human spirit which will help with your mana regen as a healer. However, paladins are the most mana efficient healers in the game by far, especially in later phases, so the extra regen won't be much of a benefit. I'd say go human in case you change your mind down the road and decide to raid as ret. It will also help you level. Humans also get perception and increased rep gain. All around better race, imo, for this particular class.
---
That's literally not literally what I said. You sound like a crazy person. Very irrational.
---
Making personal responsibility, forethought, and smart decision making a 'boomer' thing isn't really where you wanna go, is it?
---
We need more PvE realms

While you duel in front of Org or afk, other people might use HS to their fav gank location, buy mage portal, buy lock uber taxi THEN overrank you because of that. I think people now are going to be way more tryhard than they were but we will see. Hope you are right.

---
Option B if you want eng on both. If you can solo DME the nodes are worth more than the herbs.
---
Enchants that aren't proc related works fine, as well as any stats on the weapon. I wouldn't recommend enchanting anything if you are leveling a druid, there's really nothing that will actually help you. You should def. level feral dps
---
it’s incredible how much disdain people have for a class with a %int gain, %eng gain and a free ~1sec cast  to get free of a frost stomp or whatever. yes they look goofy but this meme is kinda whack
---
They spent an absurd amount of time on Karazhan, to the point of being reprimanded and told to work on other dungeons
---
Ah yeah, they are pretty equal in terms of players so makes sense
---
I mean that isn't really relavent to the original claim, that Horde has vastly more quests than Alliance, which was proven to be false. Now the whiners are just moving the goalpost. We see posts like this weekly. Just a circle jerk of "kids" whining and complaining about the same topics
---
Private servers have always been there for us
---
Ally are lame we know.
---
Based on your questions through the thread it sounds like you lack the concept of best in slot lists for gear, both pre raid and raid.
---
I'm not going to give you any because I think it would be effective for you to explore google and find them on your own. They're extremely easy to find and I think they will help give you an "action plan" of what to do with your time.
---
He was a well known dramawhore from the private server scene who is extremely toxic. He finds an issue with literally everything and is famous for constantly starting "crusades" against people/servers for even minor things. He has a very negative view on basically everything and its best to ignore him at all costs.

&gt;Hey there, glad to see this type of farm for shamans is getting traction, as d07RiV said, you can do that ledge near the tunnel or you can do this reset that I do in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWOCLZOyt5I&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWOCLZOyt5I&amp;feature=youtu.be) (ignore the songs used, mainly did it to show a friend that it's possible). The jump is a bit tricky, you need to jump to the corner from the very top of the rubble that allows you to jump to the ledge to kite the boss. If you manage the jump you should be stuck slightly off the side of the edge and then be able to jump again to get up on the pillar, after that it's just a matter of positioning to avoid getting aggro sight. Be careful of the boss's position though, if he's near the pillar make sure you're completely behind it so he can't cast abilities on you or even worse, knock you back while he's in tree form. The jump becomes much easier if you got the boots speed enchant by the way, I'm using it in the video that's why my jump is directly on the pillar's edge. Then a lesser invis pot is enough to get in the tunnel safe. I recommend practicing the jump before pulling the boss to get a good grip on it.
---
Lol, the game is in no danger of dying.

How do I get rid of addon icons from around the minimap?

I've got tonnes that i've had to resort to stacking on top of each other to reduce clutter ..
---
I wonder if I could maybe ask people to report my name so I can change it to something better. I initially tried two other classes before committing to my Hunter, and I named them in a lore friendly way. But after seeing all these meme-names I kind of got upset and named my Hunter something not-quite-rp-friendly (Hamslam, and I use a boar pet), and I kind of regret it now...   
---
Maybe I could open a ticket and ask for a change? I don't actually rp or intend to, but I'd prefer to at least be respectful of the intent of the server.
---
I’ve seen and reported so many. What’s nice is they are free honor. Over. And over. And over again.
---
If they release TBC with everyone staying at 60 (which seems cool to me), I hope they incentivize questing somehow. I want to complete that content, but I also want to get something out of it. Or I guess they could just scale it to be a 50-60 zone instead.
---
Just read the quests in Kalimdor and you get tons of buildup. There's silithid quests in like four or five different zones even for Alliance. AQ has just as much buildup as Nefarian / Ragnaros, it just isn't in your face
---
There's plenty of RP going on in this sub of people acting like 4 year olds who have never played an online game before.

Gotta love RNG!  Our raid group took about 6 weeks before we got a One-Handed Melee weapon lol.

My gameplay loop this morning has been riding around Winterspring, ganking fresh 60s who are just trying to get their quests and gold farming done. Maybe 1 in 10 encounters I have an engaging fight vs. people who came to PVP. The rest is just ganking. The game is designed to where I have to ruin a casual player's day in order to get my loot.
---
I have no source. I base it on pservers being able to go as high, or even higher, and that blizzard has said multiple times that they'd increase capacity. Other than that, i have played vanilla for years and its night and day.
---
As for the others, again, noone is arguing whether this is expected or not, whether it's fair or not or whatever you seem to think. You said its balanced, i said it isnt, now you give me some "balanced for classic" (??? What even is that supposed to mean?) bullshit. Objectively speaking it is not balanced, period, literally thats the end of the conversation.
---
I've abandoned my main and moved to Hydraxian, stuff went south REAL bad REAL quick once the pvp system came up
---
Grobbulus
---
What is your build?
---
Good.
---
You never wondered why Tarren Mill has level 55+ elites while SouthShore has none?
---
Shadow Priests are as good at 1v1 pvp than rogue, warlock, mage, and especially druid.
---
I'm sorry- a skinning knife? Why a skinning knife?
---
&gt;Nobody else wanted the items so why would anyone care what kind of gear I want to wear?
---
I agree that no one should care as long as you'll actually use the items. Hence my comment about a Warlock Tank. Or maybe your current gear sucks so much that it's a temporary upgrade, who knows? However, there's plenty of people that need on stuff they'll never actually use - they probably thought you were one of them. A quick "hey can I have this for offspec" or similar has always been enough to get the okay, in my experience.
---
&gt;As long as the content gets cleared, again, who cares?
---
Because other people are putting in the time and effort. If everyone had that attitude, nothing would get cleared. Raiding is a team effort - if your class/spec isn't the optimal choice, that's alright with most people, but you have to *try*.
---
And honestly, that attitude is probably the reason for your bad experiences. Your problem isn't "elitism". Your problem is that you are sometimes acting like an asshole, and people are responding in kind.
---
id like to know this as well
---
As the only Spriest in my guild I'm normally in the top 3 on dps with only 3 warlocks in our main raid (when you account for Shadow Weaving stacks). I also have 436 SP with Anathema and full pre-raid bis. If you have the gear and the consumables you can be a solid dps. When needed I'll heal in MC but my offspec set is at 526 healing power with Bene so healing in shadow is still a cake walk.
---
I honestly think it sucks if you're in a guild that limits what you're able to play in Molten Core (unless you haven't cleared yet). You should look for guild that lets you play what you've geared for. I made sure to focus on grinding pre-raid gear and I also helped a lot of guildies out and have earned a lot of people's respect which I think is  another reason why people in my guild are fine with me being shadow.
---
The first 10 levels you're using all spells.  As of bear form, you spend most of your time in bear form normally until you also have cat (when solo levelling).  I think having the +30sp would let you skip being a bear mostly.  It definitely would speed things up considerably.  But not as much as a mage.
---
wtf is this interface :D i would totally freak out, why do you want so much space between the buttons, so you have to look over your whole screen? you could have 2 bars a third of that sice
---
Well that's s fact but I'm sure they're also aware.
---
Or just set your hearth go camp Mojave and abuse that astral recall lol
---
Whatever happened to that boomkin who AITA and basically gquit/gkicked for wanting free tier gear that he didn't have any intention of utilizing soon. Wonder if he found a new guild and got dominance already
---
Are you guaranteed a Rich Thorium Vein every time?
---
?
---
Dwarf priest &gt; every priest... there is a reason their race class abilities are now baseline for all priests
---
Lol BC raids got nerfed WAY harder than vanilla content ever did. Do you even magtheridon
---
As predicted, rppvp servers are places for non-rp players to gank rp players and thus unpleasant and have no rp going on. Meanwhile, on our rp pve server Bloodsail, people who want to pvp are doing so, and people who want to rp are also doing so..... 
---
I don't have any regrets.
---
Maybe on private servers this is what pvp is?
---
Obviously it goes without saying that this is not what pvp was in vanilla, since there were *far* less players on one server back then
---
People have played on PvP servers all their wow lives and it's never been remotely close to what is going on. Classic is a recreation of vanilla, no one expects it to be exactly the same but the state of the game is so wildly different to everyone's vanilla, and previous PvP server experiences. Not sure how you think people should have expected this. 
---
I even swapped servers on launch day to go to a less populated realm as blizz suggested. That ended up being useless because the new realm is now high pop and wildly imbalanced. So yeah, I did try to avoid a cluster fuck but blizzard's handling of launch week and subsequent free transfer offers was basically worst case scenario.
---
1. it always was
---
2. true, more people, i wouldn't say way more but it is more.
---
3. they were always there, including gankers...even on PvE servers.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/299RtYR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/299RtYR.jpg) 
---
average kill times aren't much slower than the fastest. i'd say fight depending 5-20 seconds longer tops, probably leaning more around 8-10 seconds variation.
---
we skip like, idk, if i had to guess 80% of trash? maybe more? we don't sit around and bullshit, we do loot later, we only drink a handful of times, we use nifty/swiftness potions to go from domo/rag....I mean all of this info is widely available with a simple 30 second google search, I don't know how you think its so hard to do MC in under an hour. Or do you know that, you just don't think I am doing it? lol
---
I think overall, people on RP servers are trying to play the game, but also dont mind getting side tracked by people stopping them and trying to sell them Lucky Charms for 50s
---
Looks like it worked on you.
---
Yup it's pretty shit even for the dominating faction.I actually wish I could swap to ally(horde is dominant on my server ofc) so I could fight all the solo pvpers. Right now the only alliance you can kill are either A) fresh 60's B) fully consume stocked pvpers running in 5man groups. Meanwhile horde is filled with solo players and if I just went somewhere quiet I could get a ton of sick 1v1's and get good honor doing it. Please let me faction swap blizzard :(
---
Yes. Thunderfury required elementium, which can only drop in BWL. Off trash I think.
---
That's the problem
---
Doesnt stop the 10 player alliance raids from hiding on the zeppelins bottom floor and ganking any level 30-40 horde travelling to and from STV.
---
Also on Bloodsail-Horde. Outnumbered 2-1 by Alliance and it's great. Highly recommend.
---
it's possible, but not probable. our guild has seen one mageblade, 0 toeps, 1 choker of the firelord, and 1 ring of spellpower. in 14 clears.
---
The thing is, the Horde have more 'relevant' quests.
---
There are more alliance zones within the same level ranges for the quests, so you have 3 different zones which are from 10-30.
---
The Horde's questing is more streamlined in general in my opinion, flight paths more or less everywhere, zeppelins all that jazz.
---
This is beautiful man, going on my vision board.
---
That just means you're even less prepared.
---
The flag drops once you’ve been in the instance long enough for it to drop even on a PvP server.  Five minutes or whatever it is.
---
&gt; get 8 wow tokens in several hours of gameplay
---
Dynamic spawns mean little since world resources like herbs aren’t really worth much in retail.
---
 The token is like 200k atm. You aren’t farming 1.6 mil in “several hours of gameplay.”
---
The token would cost far more if the sum it provided was only an hour or two of farming.
---
Not that bad on benediction but it's noticable. Usually a 3-4 sec but sometimes up to 20 sec
---
I dont see the context of him wanting to invite his friend. Maybe your level isn't high enough. Maybe he remembers you from a previous party and doesn't like you...or maybe he does want to get a friend instead. No idea, but it could be a lot of things. Is indeed spineless tho.
---
Pally OP ofc

Note: this should also work with BRD chest of the seven.

60sec on Firemaw
---
Edit: Friends complain it's 30minutes for them
---
Sorry about the noob question but what is a good sword to get at my level, and how do I get it?
---
Gotta love Second Wind
---
Fiery works.
---
PvP would never have been how it was in Vanilla simply due to what the general playerbase knows now about the game and how the approach to gaming has shifted, especially with MMORPGs.
---
Even if the server sizes were the same as they were back then, the same problems **except** for overpopulation would still exist. Flightpaths, the Blackrock and Boats are easy spots to camp other players -  be it alone or in a group.
---
swords is what you're aiming for. aslong as you can sinister strike though, anything is fine until you get to the weapon class buffs in the talent tree (5% crit/5% double attack etc). just get whatever has the highest damage range in main hand and whatever has highest dps in OH (quicker is good too). 
---
swords are preferred for two reasons: it's relatively easy to get great weapons (check google for which weapons you should be aiming for, a lot of them are quest items) and because they're great dps.
---
I definitely want something higher pop. I like pve more than pvp but mostly im interested in community and sociability. I like to have fun and party but also feel like I belong
---
Pretty much once u hit 60 its all grind , farming dungeons to get BiS gear , dungeons for gold can do all quests for shits n giggles.. pvp ... level an alt x)
---
I don’t have any confirmation, but perhaps it’s because the reset/maintenance day is done a bit differently on Classic than it was back in Vanilla. 
---
Just a guess though, might be totally unrelated.
---
Ummmm hard to tell what’s happening here. For all we know you tried to join a group for a dungeon that you were way too low level for. You were invited and immediately dropped, what are the odds of “one of his friends” messaging right when you joined.
---
More likely though, he got a different dps type he preferred. And you’re right that he was too lazy to explain and just ignored you. But we really have no idea from this screenshot.
---
Close fight, nice try
---
I leveled riposte first on my alt and it felt pretty good. Remember parrying is extra dps when questing.
---
Abso-fab
---
OFC it is. It was an extremely unbalanced, clunky, grindy, game. On the other hand you have what 15 years of game development brings you: retail. The no changes bullshit was from delusional people who never played the game or childish streamers banking on those people. Classic wow could have been a fantastic opportunity of taking what good the vanilla system was and making it better, but, alas, the people have spoken.
---
are the rank 14 weapons really that powerful considering future raids that are coming soon with their items added into the game ?
---
Been seeing a lot of these threads lately. I'm not sure people understand there are diminishing returns on honor and you lose a flat % every week.
---
Ok awesome, thank you very much for the advice!
---
Just talk to him again. Someone had this question a few weeks ago.
---
Retail though. I hope they do a ban wave soon. I've seen a lot on my low pop realm.
---
Grob is pretty balanced. Both factions do a lot of World PvP stuff, but I think they're one of the only servers out of both regions without unfucked balance.
---
Under rated post, would love to see more... also who downvotes this?!
---
riposte alone is a massive talent for levelling speed, so get that first.
---
hit is incredibly important though for most levelling.
---
a trick to level quicker as warrior/rogue is to only target green quests and grind on mobs that are 2-3 levels below you, the +hit and +crit you get from that means you can get decent xp/hr.
---
Happens in all cities/towns. I think it happens when alerting a Civilian, and the amount of guards spawning is proportional to the amount players in the vicinity.
---
If you're looking to do group content like dungeons, ds ruin is the go to, if you are looking for a good all around build ( dungeons, solo farm, pvp ) sm/ruin I kinda jack of all trades but not the best in one specific thing. Soul link is the best for pvp and ds/ruin is a lilttle bit better in raids and for solo runs ( mara/dm ). My suggestion is, go ds ruin, get your pre bis and farm gold in mara, do raids and stuff. Eventually you will have to respec probably weekly if you want to pvp cuz soul link is so much better at it then any other spec. If you dont want to pvp, stay ds/ruin.
---
The burning buildings in stratholme
---
I’d say Priest just because they’re very mana efficient in the open world while having 5/5 Spirit Tap and using Wands with 5/5 Wand Specialization.
---
Holy Paladins or Resto Druids are probably the slowest.
---
Shamans have the option of leveling Elemental which does very good damage but tends to be kind of slow early on and rather mana inefficient.  But they can heal fine as ele since they’ll basically be using the same gear while leveling.
---
Looking at what's different between having 30 in Aff vs 9 Aff and 21 Demo, we're basically sacrificing Fel Conc, Siphon Life, Nightfall, and 10% damage from SM from our drain tanking rotation. 
---
In exchange we get dual voidwalker sac, more Sta, better healthstones. 
---
Despite gaining more consumable ways to refill your health or absorb damage, it's less sustainable without SL/Fel Conc, so you would do less damage and need to drink more often. Still doable though; it's not like it drops your kills/hr to holy paladin levels.
---
Scatter shot is helpful. Keep your distance and learn how to wing clip and concusive shot as you kite.
---
&gt; Played private servers for years, never had an issue such as what we have now.
---
What lol. Guilds used to full raid-train shit like Light's Hope on Light's Hope Private server all the time. My private server in terms of griefing and ganking was some of the worst I've ever experienced in 15 years of playing WoW.
---
no, shammy healer.  :D
---
what the hell does this mean lol, like why does it matter, who actually pvps for "recognition"
---
People can't take a joke.
---
I’m not talking about me.. Jesus. That’s just the case with any game with a scoreboard. I’m not saying that’s what is important, of course it’s not. That’s just what most people care about.
---
As I’ve stated I think the true estimate is somewhere close to 70% horde and 30% alliance. 
---
Prior to P2 it was pretty evident we were heavily outnumbered and when the first series of transfers occurred we went from perhaps 60/40 to closer to 65/35. Once honor hit it got even worse.
---
The description of your complaining about more people rolling horde in classic is way different from talking to a wall. Here: https://i.imgur.com/EsRbX2a.jpg
---
Engineering of course. Trinkets and grenades and rocket helms make a massive difference. As far as specs I argue that 21/27/3 is the best solo PVP spec with Intim and Scatter shot but normal marks raiding specs still work great.
---
With the Eagle Eye macro you can scout the entire zone, and check if chokepoints are safe to pass thru. That combined with track humanoid mean its really hard to get snuck up on. And if you think a Rogue is nearby you can  equip Catseye Goggles + Track Hidden and you should always see them in stealth before they open on you.
---
And in general just make sure your keybinds make sense and the important stuff is bound to easy to reach binds.
---
I am pretty sure it was like that before I even got to him tho
---
Doesn't he have to concentrate more though since projectors have less quality or something - which strains the eye even more?
---
Personally i hate how everyone just sits there flying idle outside the bank or ah. Also makes the world feel more dead as im not running past people /waving and buffing. quite often. Also i fucking haaaated minding my own business then like a lvl 100 something swoops down kills me then takes off again, like thanks dick. People still do that on reg mounts but i feel like i can at least see them and try to run lol
---
41k u get standing 14? That looks buggy yeah.
---
Anyone with half a brain could go read how PvP system works in Vanilla, then go read that phase 2 will be PvP rewards with no BGs. Anyone could do this. Its a 15 year old game. Everyone knew this was coming.   
---
What you are describing is buying a car and not knowing you would have to pay for insurance, despite literally EVERYONE knowing you need insurance to drive.  Then complaining about having to pay for the insurance over and over again acting like something will change.
---
I'm 60. This is for strat live
---
Huh? There are choices in a video game that will affect your enjoyment in the game for several years. One of those is picking the correct server. There were plenty of posts on Reddit warning of p2 on pvp servers, and even more info available with a little bit of looking. 
---
What do you call ignoring all that information, and then crying for blizzard to change everyones gameplay experience to suit them? I guess you could add entitlement too
---
Depends on the quality of the projector, the surface of the wall, the lighting in the room and how intensely he needs to focus on small objects.   
---
I figure, if he's playing PvE he should be fine
---
Now THIS is classic content!
---
Hmm, I wonder how accurate it is. I was under the impression that the census addon was broken a while ago. Anecdotally, I play on Fairbanks and it certainly doesn’t feel like 50/50 split
---
Just a heads up, the librams turned in at dire maul have the breadcrumb quest Elven Legends which is not mentioned on wowhead.
---
What faction do you play? You might be on a good server but a lot of people who think they’re on a close to balanced server are just on the dominant faction, but I do think there’s a few that are pretty good.
---
What server?  I have a sword of zeal for sale on Herod Horde
---
I wouldn’t blame yeah mate, good luck on your adventures hopefully a change would help!
---
PvP server  = Forced to PvP at any time, even if it is not convenient for you.  
---
PvE server = Choose exactly when you PvP.  
---
What are you missing dude? What do you expect a PvP server to be? A PvE server?
---
What about the windmills near horde streams... does my head in when fishing for nightfins in mojache.
---
Or the turtles in alterac mountains spalshing on the water while walking *SPLOSH! SPLOSH! SPLOSH!*
---
You're quite dense aren't you?
---
Hello Daddy? Haha kidding, both my parents, little brother and two cousins have all resubbed to enjoy classic again, it's been awesome!!
---
Fuckkk dude, tell me who wins the superbowl please, if you're so good at flawlessly predicting the future. 
---
I complained once, not over and over again xD This is literally not what anybody had in mind for what was going to happen lmao, speculation isn't always right. Anyways why you personally attacking me? Bad day at work.
---
I play 2 hand fury Alliance. With world buffs and full consumables I’m the Top DPS in the raid group every week. I out DPS the duel wield warriors even without world buffs. My only competition is a Rogue. I out DPS him with world buffs but if I die he will take over the number 1 spot.
---
Not trying to defend their coding.. but why is that a bad thing necessarily?
---
Having access to someone's guid doesn't open vulnerabilities does it?
---
There are still more total Horde and the average horde player is more interested in pvp. There should still be a significant difference in queue times.
---
We have gotten 9 Leafs in a row. One priest has Benediction out of all of us.
---
how will i know if i don’t have a target though
---
My mage lost a Crimson Felt Hat to a priest who was going to spec shadow in Phase 2.
---
That's litterally my dream bed. To have a TV in the ceiling so I can just lay in bed and play. I saw a dude with a similar idea but he build a frame above the bed and mounted 2 big TV's. One for him one for his partner. I think he had some sort of disability. I saw it on Reddit a long ass time ago, I wonder if he made any upgrades.
---
It is also a sword. There are plenty of Rogues and Warriors, especially alliance humans, who want dual swords. Any sword with that much damage is very, very sought after. That would likely sell for a very, very large sum of gold. Atleast 20,000. Atleast.
---
You thought you did, but you didnt.
---
Good riddance.
---
Next time listen when people warn over and over again about what a PvP server means.  
---
We will not lose our community. We have played on private servers for years we aren't going to stop now. In Vanilla, PvP happened, people cried and quit, others stayed. The servers didnt just die "cause of blizzard's inaction". Your just being a baby, go roll PvE, or wait til BGs and things will calm down.  
---
We wanted Vanilla. We got Vanilla. We didnt want precious little baby's vanilla where he doesn't get ganked when he wants to run an instance.  Seriously what did you think PvP server meant? You expect to not get ganked on a PvP server?
---
Yes, of course, no combat log activity, no spy detect.
---
1h and 2h is 9% dw is 24%
---
Now go back a few comments and read what I wrote there.
---
with rogue you're kinda fucked against melee (outside of kiting war, which WotF does help against) and have it somewhat easy against classes that can fear (SL locks aside), more classes can stun you than fear you and personally i think how broken orc racial is makes it an easyish choice. plus it's a passive. 
---
WotF feels more like a button that helps you win encounters you'd normally win anyway. orc racial just lets you win better against classes you'd normally have struggles against.
---
I will likely never get Viskag sword from Ony.
---
No wonder; thats what u are; maybe admit it and live with ur choices
---
This is content I like. None more pvp bitchfest plz
---
Edit: a word
---
Just play on a PvE server, problem solved
---
Alliance are scum. Your fault for rolling alliance
---
/r/wow
---
People who play wow are more toxic, I wonder why
---
While I think that almost everything in TBC is better than Vanilla (Classes, Speccs, Dungeons, Raids, general gameplay) - TBC also introduced the thing that for me lead to the downfall of WoW in general - flying mounts.
---
Flying mounts made the world largely pointless. This is what then lead to things like dungeon finder, raid finder etc. If there's no real reason to go out in the world, why force people to do it?
---
I would love a TBC without flying mounts, but that would obviously be allot of investment, cause the world isn't designed for it.
---
I'm on Skeram which is super horde dominated, but I typically die twice on my way to DME to farm. There's some alliance that basically live on the path there. Horde may clear them out momentarily, but they'll be back shortly.
---
I'd say I average somewhere around 5-8g per run for herbs depending on how many 3x dreamfoil nodes and Ghost Mushrooms I find. It's not a huge amount but it is nice as a supplement between winning the Crystal lottery
---
Yes, you have proven your point classic isn't for you, I get it.
---
You have to understand that the people who are farming honor in cities have been doing it for hours upon hours and they know every area where guards will spawn in, and what actions will draw guard aggro. You obviously don't have the experience they do, so of course you're gonna get fucked by guards.
---
what do you mean 4:3 widescreen? you mean you want it stretched?
---
Sometimes those players use the same name in retail than in classic. So you can look them up and see how they fare in actual rated pvp.
---
For example, the warlock who /laugh at me when I was 1v3. Same name, same guild name on retail. (And I actually asked him through my 2nd account).
---
 He's currently stuck at 1700 as a WARLOCK in 2v2 with over 800 games played. Meanwhile I got my week fresh 120 warlock to 2300 in under 150 games. Those players suck but they rely on numbers, and there's nothing you can do but shrug it off.
---
If someone is on the WoW subreddit today taking issue with the current state of PvP, then you absolutely were warned. 
---
Players said ‘hey, this happened on private servers and it was really really bad, and it’s going to be worse in classic with bigger servers.’ 
---
People were and have been laughing about how bad it was going to be since launch. 
---
I agree that it sucks. It’s bad design, I agree. They should have had more servers, I agree. 
---
But it’s classic. This is the classic system. World PvP has and always will be total shit like 90% of the time. If you play retail, you’d know what providing ‘good’ loot in exchange for world PvP results in. The stuff people bitch about in classic now, happened last patch on retail WoW when blizzard incentivized the alliance to turn on warmode with heroic gear (lol). 
---
The difference is that retail is an evolving game. Blizzard said ‘damn we fucked up there’ and they reverted that change. 
---
But that’s retail. Retail gets changes. 
---
Classic isn’t going to get changes outside of maybe content-release schedule, major game breaking bugs, or something for the AQ gates. 
---
If you want changes, it isn’t the game for you, and you have to make peace with that. 
---
But sure, if you weren’t on reddit or any WoW forums and if you weren’t playing WoW prior to now, then you can’t be expected to anticipate phase 2. Everyone who fits the above criteria opted in with full warning and full knowledge.
---
Hmmm, any comments on this then?  [https://i.imgur.com/qbCRlu1.png](https://i.imgur.com/qbCRlu1.png)
---
Cross faction BGs easy.
---
Whats the best way to farm [The Gammer of Grace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11923/the-hammer-of-grace)? Runs that include the Chest of The Seven are usually extremely long and tedious, and I'm always concered that someone ninjas it by accident. However, according to Wowhead and AtlasLoot it also drops from the Secret Safe... is there any trick to get the item more easily this way?
---
EDIT: Typo.
---
The only thing this turd sees is problems anyway. Spineless guy still playing blizz games.
---
i struggled like hell getting pre-bis as rogue, you're competing against warriors, enh shammy, rogues, hunters and feral druids (??). there's a fuck ton of warriors, hunters and rogues so you're usually partying with one.
---
the worst however is that it's hard enough to get a group because of how many other rogues there are, even when i make groups i get constant "hey rogue here inv" when i look for dps.
---
Why slice and dice, I need the dps from my DoT as rogue...
---
Would herb drop in price in the future?  Should i save my herbs for later phase if i don't have anything i need to buy at the moment?
---
Imagine rolling PvP and then crying about getting ganked.   
---
Play the game stop crying.
---
Not only would that not change the problem that faerlina is a server full of streamers, but you'd effectively be creating another problem by doing that: making another server a high profile target. People who signed up for faerlina knew what they were getting into and if they didn't, transfer off.
---
That's beta as fuck
---
big bank
---
Not sure if it’s because I’m on mobile but I can’t see that with any clarity.
---
that's fine, then i'll just quit. I already know what TBC with flying mounts is, it sucks very quickly, i'm just going to resume not caring about blizzard. It's not really a issue there are other great games, and the thing is, pantheon will exist by the time of TBC so its going to be even more irrelevant tbh.
---
In fact the discussion about TBC is really silly cause A.) Blizzard doesn't make good choices hence having server transfers for factions with lower pop vs higher faction side pop as the most recent example and B.) Pantheon will exist and blizzard apparently can't make good games anymore so ya
---
How do you poop
---
We’re outnumbered big time, we will have insta queue while horde will have to wait, xrealm wont change that
---
In wotlk we cleared naxx 25 from expansion release to ulduar release and never once saw the shaman healing belt drop.
---
Nice, I'm 4k into revered at level 57.i just like the little furballs
---
Except if they stand out in the open, no one runs by them.
---
I run with people and we constantly stand behind trees/hills and 95% of people will run right up to you.
---
Alliance. There's certainly more horde as I understand horde have every world boss kill and their biggest guild is on RG7, where ours we have the higher tier guilds still advertising for RG2 and 3 still. I've heard it rumored as low as 30:70 but as high as 40:60, I dont think theres a definitive number but it's not the worst server imbalance out there
---
And they also got a ton of proc rates and coefficients way off, as well as way overtuning content. Pservers may have itemized in cycles but they were not closer to how vanilla was. We're getting a late version of the game with locked out content.
---
If you don't mind asking, what was the reason for the surgery? I've heard of cornea transplants but it sounds like you only had a partial cornea surgery .
---
Fuck off
---
everyone says the horde are awful (they are) but no one gives you props for being really freaking good at what you do man, that was some sick plays
---
At level 11, I wouldn’t worry about anything specific.  There’s a pretty good progression guide on this page - https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/rogue/leveling-1-60/
---
"... we came in peace" "... looking for pvp"? Haha
---
I see that I was doing sims for 3731 armor, which is appropriate for this phase. Sunder armor, curse of recklessness, and faerie fire already reduce that to 336 boss effective armor.
---
BRE has the potential to strip off 2100 armor (personally for its wielder), but it can't do much to make use of that potential in the current raid tier if you're running with a group that applies a minimum set of armor debuffs already. (Any particular reason not to have a warlock for curse of recklessness?)
---
BRE will be much better when bosses have more armor.
---
Find a guild that isn't full of douchebags? I don't really know what to tell you. Unless somebody is being mean to me I'm not mean to others.
---
Have you been able to confirm that it reduces everyone's threat by 100%? We've been working under the assumption it reduces threat of those hit by it, even if resisted, by 100%. Thus the MT problems.
---
Yah for sure. I do this as well in both wow (holy priest) and Dota. But the sad fact is that only healers do that. Your teammates appreciate it, definitely. But they’re not resorting by healing at the end of a BG. Though it IS possible to top the HK board this way.
---
yea this the one to control weather density!
---
an other one would be /console ffxglow 0 if the game looks too bright. :)
---
I offered 50g in world chat. The mats cost 200 or 250, so I think that's fair. I imagine people do it more cheaply, but I didn't want to quibble over 20g to start going fast.
---
It's a 3 day break so you don't look at anything.... How is this resting your eyes?!
---
Knowing exactly where and when the black lotus spawn, is a win.
---
IIRC some of their buffs still leave a mark in advanced combat log as an aura. I have never delved into this stuff deeply I have to admit.
---
Nobody gets recognition. Why are healers constantly crying about it?
---
&gt; It's not PvP, it's just a massacre. Releasing honour without BGs was a massive mistake and it has ruined the game for many. 
---
So funny how this subs attitude changed. All the veterans predicted this but everyone just cried for "muh world pvp"
---
But how does one bubble hearth with no hearthstone?
---
Salty little scrub
---
His fragile ego can't handle the fact that 10vs1 isn't superior PVP skill :D
---
Which herbs? For example, Purple Lotus is going to skyrocket in a few months, other ones I am not so sure.
---
Yeah, was just giving you reference between a talk I had with someone. Their duo team were making about 150g/hr. As long as you can keep half that pace solo, it’d average out to roughly the same. But they had enchanting which upped theirs a little bit.  So without, you might be making 60-65g roughly. I just don’t know if that pace is realistic or not.
---
This is lame. Just ally tips
---
And you are still an old man yelling at cloud by being unhappy with obvious things which aren't going anywhere.
---
You act like there's 1000 torches in the game u gotta press
---
Or advertise in general. What a turd. Like when I get whispered to heal UBRs when I’m in gadgetzan, fly to dust wallow, boat to menethil, then mid flight to TP get told they’re pulling the only boss I need for gear. NICE.
---
BEAST MODE! Hell yeah dude. Good shit lol btw Look at the comment above there is a even better way vs the last boss that involves just taking an invis pot i am gonna be using that from now on 0 deaths every time is going to feel so good lmao
---
It's a shame you're so into lecturing others that you can't even tell it was a joke.
---
The equivalent of Menethil is Grom Gol. It is not in a safe zone. This is probably the biggest lie currently spread on this topic.
---
Pumpkin without question
---
Yeah not everyone is a fking NEET that finds camping flightmasters 10 hours a day a meaningful life.
---
You get a lot less honor for healing. You will rank up slower than just dps.
---
Flawless
---
I've never taken that boat without dying since P2.
---
Wow I was more than 50g, considering it takes time of the warlock to be a part of the group, right? I'm approaching that stage and had in mind a much higher asking price - was expecting 100g + (given it originally cost 250g).
---
One multi shot in a hunters rotation and it’s a big ole RIP
---
My understanding is that feral is much better than Resto for levelling.  Dipping into balance for natural shapeshifter and omen of clarity is also pretty good.

This is why I dislike addon/mod managers in games. Just manually install, it isn’t any extra effort.

Maybe a warrior would be better to answer, but I feel like towards the end of BWL is when replacements can be found.

Yes, they are the same party! :3

Then yah, the last part of what I said. But we can still only take your word on it.

omg if i want and can play 20 accounts and will decide to farm some crap the way i want  - you will call it indirect pay-to-win scheme? since when this decision even came to people's mind?

---
Thank you! :3
---
:D
---
And now, youre complaining about classic. Which is what you asked for.
---
Perhaps blizzard was right.
---
"You think you do, but you dont".
---
i started the game a month late on Heartseeker as a horde. i found a nice guild who were leveling to finally raid. i was leveling fast to finally catch up and raid w them.
---
it was annoying getting outnumbered by alliance but nothing tooc crazy. i was playing for a month making good progress 
---
i was level 54 when phase two hit. i am only lvl 56 now. it's fucking unbearable. i literally can't do anything
---
just started a rogue alt bc i don't die as much on it
---
i was excited to play and raid but i think im gona stop when it's time to resub
---
I want them for pvp set
---
You're talking about the story. RPers very rarely accept someone's character who's "somebody". You almost always RP as a nobody.
---
For RPers, their RP character is someone who looks at their playable character, the champion of Azeroth, in awe. Like people in Classic look at Thrall and Jaina.
---
I'm lvl 49 and this is what works best for me. Since phase 2, I've been playing from 7:00 to 7:45 each morning then head off to work. I finished Feralas and Tanaris this way. It really doesn't take that long when no one else is online.
---
In the evenings, I level my rogue, do my banking, do dungeons, level my professions, etc.
---
Except it's not a 3 day break for resting my eyes.
---
I beg your pardon?
---
You're gunna be there for more than 3 days now
---
dont forget to clarify! not just getting gold! but fukin working for it to get gold, cuz even those 10 chars that are waiting for something to spawn is not even close to be unfair game as you have to sit and monitor that!
---
Talking about Meegss not Secksy
---
there are not 800 players on at a time on a medium server
---
Yup, this is why whenever you run by a priest leveling and just “help him finish his kill” you might actually be screwing him a bit
---
Thank you. Yes, the color scheme represents the wicked and savage energy of the Worgens. :3
---
What? I don't need to press torches for them to make noise. 
---
There are pyres and braziers all over Orgrimmar and I do a lot of Stratholme which is on fire, not gonna turn it up and down, rather just keep it down.
---
I just got feared inside a wall in blackrock mountain, and got disconnected.  Now whenever I log in, it disconnects me immediately, no time to unstuck/hearth.  What can I do?
---
I’ve gotten it dropped from both so I can confirm they drop.  Emp runs are slow and don’t involve the other, but the chest drops 2 things and the safe drops 1.  Honestly, if there’s anything else in brd you need, I’d just recommend doing brd emp runs.  Less people are looking for coffer runs, or runs that end at finneous/incendius/bael.
---
Yeah I recall xD. That may have given an alliance a bump to BG win rates, but not enough to offset an average of 10% lower win rate that can be seen in those charts.
---
Yeah true... but I have nothing to gain from that. Just dumbfounded that people act this way and immediately ignore so they dont have to explain their douchbag behavior
---
Alliance does this on the Zepplins. People need to stop rolling on pvp servers if they can't mentally handle it. It is ridiculous how fragile people are now, I have see more winning about pvp since the system launched than in the last decade combined on different games.
---
Don't roll on a pvp server! Everyone gets ganked on both sides the same way. I can't tell you how many times I've been killed twice going to Org from Grom'gol
---
And what exactly stops those other people from doing the same?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWOCLZOyt5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWOCLZOyt5I)   mind=blown lol
---
Did you delete your reply?
---
&gt;Nothing actually guarantees the authenticity of any of that information.
---
It's nothing but addon which allows you to manually spam /who scans of various zones and writes down the data. It's literally on github, feel free to check the code.
---
&gt;As someone who is actively playing in the world it’s incredibly hard to believe the data in the chart.
---
The data in the chart is way better than "dude trust me" source.
---
&gt;Again if you play for even five minutes on the server you’d understand the nonsense here.
---
Again: alliance concurrent online is roughly the same. They are just in dungeons, raids, capitals, wherever. If the addon scans their name as online somewhere, they are. As simple as that. Feel free to dive in your denial, this truth might be hard to bite.
---
&gt;Edit: to point 1 blizzard themselves admitted the population per server is much greater than it was in vanilla.
---
I am not sure which source do you use, but it was "substantially increasing the number of players that can be simultaneously logged in and playing". Which was, if you pay attention to the interview Ion gave, the amount of layers. 1 layer was roughly equal to 1 vanilla realm: while 1 classic server had several layers, the amount of people logged was more indeed (it's not that people of different layers were able to be engaged in world pvp but whatever). Then blizzard lowered the amount of layers and eventually reduced it to 1, so this is what you have.
---
As long as you have some actual online population values from Blizzard to consider them an authority, feel free to provide. I am sure you don't though.
---
It all started with glaucoma a few years ago, had surgery for that 4 times. Those surgeries messed up the inner layer, leading to Fuch's Dystrophy. The outer layer is probably still in good enough shape to keep that, so the doctors decided to go with a lamellar transplant first.
---
why have you assumed that this person is having multibox? these days you actually can run multiple windows of same fukin game with difference of having multiple accounts? 
---
doesnt it count? what line you wanna draw? dude is paying over 100$ and keeping chars online - its not even close or beside botting or multiboxing
---
Currently leveling a 46 druid alt, Feral is the way to go.
---
No, it didn't. But please fake outrage more
---
Cause the people that ran pservers had a passion for the game
---
Does perception really work? 
---
Rogues continue to kill (one level below me) 3 seconds after my skill disappear and I see nothing before, during and after the activation.
---
I think the downside is the insanely high skillcap and the amount of bindings. My roomie is probably one of the top 3 druids on my server. He has like 40+ bindings. 
---
A good Druid in PvP uses all forms, all the time, regardless of spec. For example if you’re healing in PvP, you better still be rooting people, moonfiring, switching to bear BEFORE melee gets on you, switching to cat/travel to chase people down, switching forms to break CC. Etc etc.
---
I see a lot of druids only use cat form or only heal...those guys might as well be priests or rogues because if your not switching forms you’re just a worse version of those classes.
---
I'll be honest, I haven't played since early legion. But unless there are numbers to back up what you say I'm going to continue using the numbers available that show the huge Horde win rate.
---
As for PvE I have no idea.
---
Horde is favored, that's no secret. Why are you flagged for PVP in IF though?
---
Whats the point of having 3 hunters
---
I can get up for 20 minutes every two hours.
---
Nope. I dont delete my replies. Mod must have removed. I dont give a shit about offending an imbecile like you.
---
people stop being silly and jealous. the person who has those chars online is paying for their online, in anyway the main char has to collect whatever he is haunting.
---

He can know exactly where and when black lotus spawns.

Yeah there are logs and vods on the fight club (warrior) Discord. Personally I've confirmed it by using their Weak aura that displays the  GUID list of the raid and just had those in melee with the lowest sit in for Wrath of Rag and it hits the same 3 people each time.

If you tank Strat Live you can charge first orb, which sells for 20-25g

Nope. If you're dying that much you're just spawning and dancing around 10 times. 3 deaths max from door of BRM to MC.

It goes both ways, some alliance didn't even make it into DM east yesterday on HS.

---
Got a source that it doesn't do threat after it has been applied?
---
It was discovered and confirmed 3 weeks ago, it may have been present longer than that.
---
Bro you are using a source that is saying the total population was less than 3,500 when the queues could reach as high as 2,000. It’s incredibly evident it’s not accurate information. Doesn’t take a rocket scientist to tell you that’s it’s wrong. But by all means continue thinking it’s correct if that fits your narrative better.
---
Edit : https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835

Blizzard admitting queues of over 10k as a possibility. Your source for population is just total BS.

---
Trinket swapping with FD is part of the hunter toolkit so at least OP has that going for him.  Assuming that the furbolg stays summoned after swapping it would def add dps since you can weave the FD trinket swap between your autoshots to not lose dps.
---
Any details on when it’s coming out?
---
He didnt stream snipe though.
---
Hahaha the system is same game that's been successful for years on private, fuck off.
---
Read your dumbass comments back to yourself out loud, then your user name...
---
If your only motivation to raid is to get your own personal set of gear you should probably stop raiding. It will likely be a frustrating experience.
---
If you play with a solid group of people you enjoy playing with and are motivated to gear up the raid it’s a much more fun/satisfying experience. Every run SOMEONE is getting loot.
---
Interesting thanks ill give it a go
---
You playing as alliance?  Does it feel like there's roughly as many alliance as horde per zone?  I don't mind dying so much as having nobody around to help because alliance aren't even leaving the capital cities unless they're heading straight to an instance.
---
Hahahaha wow you are mad, huh? Proven wrong and instead of admitting you were wrong (don't even have to apologize, I couldn't care less) you ramble on about "fucking tryhards REEEEE go back to retail noobs", as if that makes any sense. Nobody I raid with is a retail player, all are either new to vanilla or pserver players.
---
And the point is, its fun. It is fun to kill bosses in 20 seconds that take most people 2 minutes. Its fun to run through MC in 40 minutes and have tons of world buff/flask left for another raid. Its NOT fun spending hours upon hours in MC, wasting time bullshitting, killing trash for jack shit besides some whatever BoE tier gear we get enough of already...
---
Everything we do and stand for is like, the opposite of retail and retail mentality. Are you okay dude? You're really starting to not make sense at all.
---

I'm not a gambling man, but if I was I'd think that potions/elixirs/Flasks (and their mats) used for raids should raise in price when BWL is released, to ensure content dies soon after release.

Finding historical data is kind of hard, but there is a ton of discussion from a few years ago discussing how dominant Alliance was in Arena (never cared much for RBGs, don't know about them) 
---
Of course since Every Man For Himself got nerfed in Legion and with Horde already dominating in PvE, the faction balance got fucked. 
---
Point is, Alliance dominated PvP in Arena for a long ass time.
---
He just needs to grin and bear it.
---
&gt;....so the moment they dismount to attack someone, go attack them? What's the problem here? This """"""griefing""""""""""" you're describing is literally no different than people on regular ground mounts doing it in vanilla.
---
Not really because you cant see people that drop from the sky to gank you. If they are on a riding mount you at least have better chances of seeing them coming. With flying mounts, everyone is a rogue.
---
&gt;Flying mounts still have a 3 second cast time just like any other mount. It's not the game's problem that you're too slow.
---
Except with flying mounts, after that 3 seconds they are completely safe as you just fly straight up. With a ground mount you still can have the opportunity to chase them down.
---
&gt;Being able to travel a little faster doesn't "kill the world". The main gameplay content is still on the ground. Flying is literally just for travel.
---
It kills the world when it completely removes the necessity to be on the ground outside of combat. More people traveling on the ground makes the world feel more alive.
---
Wouldn't you have the honorless target buff? Not sure what they (horde gankers) are gaining by doing that.
---
I've literally never been attacked in IF before so I'm actually curious.
---
But then I couldn't use my name which I think is very fitting for my race but probably won't be in the random name generator?
---
Having a better name generator would be nice but you still have to allow people to enter their own name.
---
Not at all, as you can see from the website, the total amount of logged raids on EU is in the rage of 100 000, and all we know about the population is that it was around 1 million the first month, and we learned that it was still growing in certain regions after the 3rd quarter earnings call. So we know that the population is around 1 million at least.  
---
100 000 is 10% of the entire population, including those who aren't even close to level 60, so it's WAY more than 10% of players who are level 60. While we don't know how many people hit 60, let's be super generous and assume that 25% (250 000) of people that tried out classic at the end of august hit 60, that would mean this website shows 40% of the level 60 population, which would make it INCREDIBLY ACCURATE. That's much more than most surveys that people derive data from and make conclusions about.  
---
Even if you don't care to read what I said, take away this, the website shows AT LEAST 10% of the population classic had month 1, most samples that include tens of thousands of people out of millions are often said to have a 0,1-5% margin of error, this sample would be on the lower end of that.
---
The best thing is watching a guide on a DM jump run with a healer, and just doing that technique. Its gonna net you both the most gold you ideally can make and is not too hard to pull off, you just need a run or two under your belt and youll figure it out.
---
Its different for everyone. We've gotten 9 Leafs from Majordomo in a row now. Every hunter can dual wield Rhok'Delar, but I still want my Benediction..
---
It’s cute to see how many people played Vanilla for like 2 months at the age of 12 and clearly never hit the cap. Boat camping isn’t new. FP camping isn’t new. Camping for raid groups headed to raids, systematic area denial, corpse camping, lvl48+ players being hunted down like dogs, spy alts, summoning alts parked in key locations, all of it, is as old as WoW itself.
---
People absolutely did play this game with a high degree of organization and sophistication the first time around. You can argue that the general knowledge floor is higher, but the ceiling hasn’t changed much at all. WoW wasn’t the first MMO. It wasn’t even considered a “hardcore” one at it’s launch. There are people who had this game way more figured out 15 years ago than you do right now, and I don’t say that to be antagonistic. 
---
It’s truly the World of WARcraft right now.

Its worked the same for years and people still play and love the system.

Just cause you dont like it doesn't mean everyone feels the same.

---
It should be a miracle, an ally posing in Searing Gorge without 10 undead rogues/mages devouring his corpse
---
PvP system is great. Classic is great.
---
I'm Horde. Control of zones seems to swing between kill squads of either faction. Alliance seems to control BRM a slight majority of the time. Just generally in my 50s, unless I was grinding dungeons, I had to pick my leveling spots extremely carefully -- being visible in a wide open space for more than a short time led to dying quickly and repeatedly. The game is playable though. Neither faction is able to shut down the entire world for the other. We might have the only genuinely fun PvP realm right now; I really hope it lasts.
---
&gt; With flying mounts, everyone is a rogue.
---
So why don't you get on your flying mount then?
---
&gt;after that 3 seconds they are completely safe as you just fly straight up.
---
I mean, same with ground mounts since nobody can catch you once you're on yours, since they all go the same speed.
---
&gt;More people traveling on the ground makes the world feel more alive.
---
Ah, so you want to completely remove a game mechanic because "muh feelz". Got it.

no yet, the post prod didn't gave new about it recently ^^"

Yeah I don't get it, we're just like everyone else here. We wanted to play the game we loved but blizzard didnt want to give it to us, so we played it  the only way we could.
---
well you're wrong. Asmongoloid is mad he got ganked by someone who always had legit intel on him from other players. He got a guy's twitch banned, a guy who did nothing against twitch's rules

point is the system is broken, it worked for years because it was free and ppl were desperate for that old school feels.
---
just cause you do like it doesnt mean its not broke.

I am going to let everyone in on a secret about Dire Maul.  This requires having a key or another way into the back door of DM-E (the one above Camp M).  You go in, you strip naked, you die to a satyr or lasher.  You will then be able to ghost walk into any of the 3 Dire Maul instances.  It actually saves time because the spirit healer is so close to the main DM entrance.

     I am melee dps so I have to deal with this mechanic every week and 90% of the time I do not die, the other 10% is primarily threat when going back in and I either just crit big or get a nasty hoj and windfury proc, but that seems normal to me. Am I missing something here? Or am I really just not noticing this mechanic?

ok, but I have still no clue what I should ask for it. haha.
---
Just full restro? Do you dip into anything else?
---
Did we get any statement on that horrible chat delay? Sometimes i have a delay of 10minutes on my messages while the rest of the game runs smoothly
---
Why did you roll a pvp server just to cry about it?
---
So pretend you have 10 extr accounts and waiting with them for something that you need. You pay money like others and you play like others and collecting this desired thing COMPETING WITH OTHERS.
---
You're absolutely right bro but in the image it looks clear that someone is boxing to spy on herb spawns. Not all boxing is like this but boxing helps improve the number of spots to do this.
---
you're still working with the wrong numbers and your logic is flawed.period.
---
you can't deduce the amount of pineapples based on the amount of apples

---
Asmongold is such a hypocrite
---
You don’t seem to get it. Every person on a faction going for PVP rank HAS to farm honor as efficiently as possible to gain ranks. If you aren’t maximising honor farm you won’t gain ranks as other members of your faction will be.
---
It’s a dumb system that isn’t that enjoyable for either the dominant faction or the side with fewer numbers. There is a reason this wasn’t happening before phase 2, when no honor points were available.
---
If the same person kills you more than 4 times (and gets no honor), it kills you if more than 12 levels diff, then it’s not about pvp rank, but I’ll bet that isn’t happening.
---
I'm a new player, so I can't speak on how blizzard will roll things out, but from a coding perspective it would be much easier to ignore when the epic dropped and simply make all disenchants use the current system.
---
OP: Classic never used to be a raid finder, people cared and formed a community. 
---
Also OP: Someone quits the guild fkem didn't need him anyway.
---
By being a strong healer obviously and knowing where to go. I was level 60 and I joined an exp/quest brd run and I was guiding them and did full clear of brd. I got the hammer on the Chest of the seven.
---
&gt;It feels weird, not sure what else to do seeing as I don't really want to level another character 200 more hours for another alt just to do the same thing seems mindnumbing.
---
I was in the same boat as you, but I rolled an alt and am having a blast playing my Druid.
---
I'd suggest you give it a shot, the benefit to playing an alt is that you don't really care about getting all the little things perfect for them. I'm honestly planning on going into MC/Ony with mostly greens at this point and will come out with at least a few T1 pieces considering we end up DE'ing most Druid gear at this point.
---
Don't forget the time saved from the FP being closer to Theramore.
---
I love the dedication of you mate.
---
Did you read the link at all? Did you? I expect not. A blizzard employee admittedly the medium sized server is larger than a full server during vanilla and stating there will be queues of over 10k on heavy populated servers admits your source is BULLSHIT. 
---
Seriously gtfo with your inability to comprehend things. 
---
You might want to ask yourself, how you are so terrible at math. 
---
Trying to act as if the population is less than 3500 on a server is laughably ignorant. Even your own quotes show that it would be much higher. Are you really that dense?
---
Have a good one because it’s clear your head is so far buried in the sand to understand how stupid you are looking. I and you have proven your source to be wrong. 
---
And again, a blizzard employee is a MUCH greater authority than you and your bullshit website. 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835
---
Here’s the source again that you willfully ignored. Have fun being wrong. I’m not wasting my time on you any longer.
---
tell you what? I just find it hilarious you accuse people of sucking one person dick while your doing the same, and you're responses are helping prove that point, your awfully defensive over advertise for some unhealthy reason, its pretty pathetic....
---
Good

He's probably well geared and duo with a well geared resto shaman.

Uhhh, source?
---
That is the general endgame loop, for sure. But does it have to be all about getting loot? Getting the occasional reward is nice, but I do it more nowadays for social reasons. I also enjoy seeing the loot go to players who deserve it and who put their time in. We also like to keep the endgame challenging by trying to clear raids faster and faster.
---
At some point, a lot of the loot starts being disenchanted more often because no one needs it, and thats still okay. If your guild is sufficiently organized, they'll start to stockpile the mats/gold, and when the next raid tier comes out, they can provide stuff like pots/flasks for raids, and provide enchanting mats for loot, which makes the gold burden less of a thing. It doesn't help necessarily, but it makes it less of a chore to collect herbs and farm gold.
---
And since WoW classic is so simplistic with its endgame, you can see why Blizzard added so much more to do at endgame in retail - mythic dungeons, multiple difficulties, pet battles, arenas, etc. They added more to do in hopes people dont recognize that they are in these loops.
---
So he can get to the bank faster to grab more potions
---
Guild bank*
---
That only applies if you wait til that exact moment to use a +mining enchant, which 99% of people don't so it really makes no difference. You still have to go through the same headache of mining out green crap wether it be iron, mithril, whatever.
---
This is me, pretty much. I've done RP in other games but not wow (aside from idle ic kind of chatting, aimlessly). After rerolling when rl friends quit, and then the server I went to going to... hell basically), I rerolled Grob for balance and the fact RPers are just more pleasant to be around
---
Ah, a man of culture. This + an mmo mouse has been my go-to tanking method all the way up until endgame dungeons even.
---
BRM is literally a PvP spot. I will admit I don't go to dire maul all too often though. 
---
But if the complaint is that a horde guild is camping popular PvP spots when wPvP is happening, then I don't know how you want to resolve that. Considering that was happening phase 1 and will happen after BGs are out.
---
Only fries... about 30mins :p
---
Yikes. Grats on the poopsocks.
---
Lol Noob
---
I've been having a blast on my druid.
---
Healing/Tanking/DPS and a ton of utility makes it possible to fill every role and handle some of the trickier quests solo.
---
Cat form/travel form speed up your questing more than just about any other class.
---
Stealth makes reaching some of the quest items/mobs way easier. 
---
Aquatic form is basically the fastest thing in water for a long time, this means that even 60's camping you will struggle to catch you if you can hit the ocean. 
---
A native teleport to Moonglade means you can set your earth to somewhere like IF/Undercity and easily access a lot of areas.
---
there will still be plenty of noobs
---
Im saying I don't think they broke it at all. Here's the scenario I swear I experienced on the 25th:
---
Enemy rogue sitting in stealth who I've never seen before. I accidentally run on top of the rogue. The rogue never casts any spell, he just continues to sit in stealth, but spy gives me an alert.
---
Maybe I have it wrong or they didn't make the changes I thought they did.
---
dude lol
---
i 'loved' it aswell...
---
well u can loook at the relative of how many people "playing", on my alt i played for 15 honor kills and got rank 1 and got placed at 4950 standing... if thats any indicator  for the horde side rank 1 and 15 kills was around 5300
---
Oh yeah all that dank cenarion, I'm sure everyone is envious lol
---
this. i never get why they whine about things that existed 15y ago. put the fuck up with it or dont play the game. ironically these ppl were crying the most about wanting #nochanges
---
Cs and ks don't share the same dr.
---
Somebody didn't do BGs for the past 13 years
---
Which definitely isn't the Ogre forged hauberk.
---
Has there been any testing to confirm this? I swear I still get alerts when nobody casts
---
Census addon still works. Automatically performing a scan was broken, so the census addon now does manual scans on mouse clicks. Results are posted to wowclassicpopulation.com
---
If your entire point is "it's going to be easier" then it will be, duh. It's already easier because one side of gankers has faced the reality of the actual grind necessary for respectable rank and the other side of ganked either rerolled pve, went back to retail or simply stopped whining on forums and reddit. 
---
There still will be gankers but it heavily depends on the battlegroup settings.
---
The current situation was foreshadowed months ago though.
---
What a boring, masturbatory post
---
Might be lying or exaggerate  but watching bits like [this](https://youtu.be/ctn-tKXx4Sw) doesn't make me want to play on a server shown. On either side.

35+ on Alliance Skeram
---
nope, logged off after looting what I needed from the chest then logged on my other char went in and got the item I wanted
---
Just a lore question about this guy,  In the text it says that he joined Uther to fight Orcs and the undead, right? Was this war he fought alongside Uther the Third War? The events of Warcraft 3?
---
You go pretty far on geared tanks and healers in terms of progress. We still waiting for our first breastplate of might :P
---
Yes, you have to 360 your character, not your camera.
---
Irrelevant or garbage, feel free to call it however you want, it's still yours.
---
Which is still worse since you’ll be splitting honor amongst a huge raid of people.
---
3 manning is faster cleaner and easier
---
Horde have a pretty sizeable advantage in AB too since Blacksmith/Lumber Mill/Farm are the easiest 3 flags to hold and Horde spawns at Farm. Pre-made vs PUG it won’t matter, pre-made will always win, but PUG vs PUG or pre-made vs pre-made, Ally faces an uphill battle in AB
---
He's talking about original vanilla.
---
im honored and about halfway to the next level and i have about 800 beads if that makes you feel better.
---
Makes sense, I stayed on a u.s server even after the first ones popped up so it was awhile before i switched and would have noticed a lower ping.
---
Lol okay.

You can get out of rogue blind withstone form.  Human does almost nothing for you but looks slightly better I guess.

Do a twink. Very fun to build and gear despite being expensive, very awesome feeling to finish the toon and explode 10+ level higher people then you. There is a really extended twink community and lots of guilds and helps around.
---
A FUCKING GOD
---
battleground in less then 2 weeks you will be fine
---
Yeah, without being ganked this game already takes a large amount of time.  it's definitely not worth the extra time needed when you get constantly ganked all the time.
---
It was fine when I was younger and had a lot of free time.
---
&gt; Like atm the issue isn't that there's a 50/50 split between servers that are horde dominant and alliance dominant leading to a nice threshold when merged/moved around.
---
There are servers dominated by alliaance 80/20, and many 55/45 or 60/40 servers. Last I checked the overall numbers are relatively even, so offering transfers to even out servers could work. Even f it jsut makes them more balanced instead of PVElite, it would encourage players to join the losing side if it's a smaller disadvantage with the possibility of a boost in numbers.
---

---
People don't seem to understand how guard mechanics work.
---
Civilians spawn guards when you get close to them, and will keep spawning guards if you kill the ones that spawn. More can spawn if there are more players nearby.
---
Normal guards aggro you like usual, can be killed, and respawn slow like a normal mob.
---
Just being inside an enemy city does not give you automatic guard aggro.
---
Oh I was talking about how you approach the gates from TP. There's often a conga line of camping that I can avoid by taking a longer path around it.
---
Dude, is your reading comprehension zero? Read your own link, it proves my point, not yours. Protip: pay attention to layers.
---
Also don't be so angry and salty over nothing, it's bad for your health: save it for another corpserun.
---
Hmm. How much threat does battle shout generate? I could see it being a possible tool in the tool kit for that kind of situation. Would definitely depend on the situation.
---
Same happens to all RP-PVP realms, they're a meme even on retail. Defias Brotherhood EU lasted a few years, then the "lolers" and people hellbent on PvP alone basically forced everyone to transfer to Argent Dawn.
---
This exactly
---
Zeppelins are available to all ghosts.
---
I play horde and have seen allies yell ok boomer.  I didn’t know horde could do it to them too.
---
Flying destroys world PvP. The world is completely dead except for farming spots. And if someone tries to kill you at a farming spot, you can just mount up and hover over them.
---
Lmao this is hilarious honestly. so this dude decides that his best course of action is to repeat the same action that got him killed and he did this for 30 minutes without trying anything different. Amazing.
---
no one cares you unsubbed loser hahahaha
---
&gt;living bomb on everyone
---
Rattlegang!  I’ve run into lil Epstein a few times.
---
Lmfaoooo tell them to get over it and go back to SCC farm
---
Then I'd consider that part of "massively overgearing" if he's got all the pvp trinkets/consumables and they don't.
---
So they ran to zep and jumped off into the ocean before hitting grom? Doesn't seem like it would take long to get back haha
---
I play on a PVP server, sometimes I win sometimes I get camped.. It's all part of the game. I wish both sides of the argument would just find ways to have fun
---
What do people do to spend time when you already have mostly all BIS? (Only missing 2 MC Rings and the NS chest) Farming gold as a rogue is pretty boring for me since all I do is do pickpocket runs for like 30g an hour. Doing solo pvp is near impossible since everyone is in death squads. And I’m not really in the rush nor have the time to grind to r14 (my goal is r11 for the mount but I’m not in a rush for it). Only thing I’m waiting for is BGs atm. And I already hated the leveling process so getting an alt to 60 is not an option. Is it time to take a break until BGs come out?
---
Normally I don't like the streamers, but this has been pretty funny with how arrogant Asmon was about his dominance and how Advertise shut him down.
---
&gt; Countdown to Classic podcast
---
Could you list the ones you recommend or do you link to your previous comment listing them? I would love to listen to the interview you fancied.
---
&gt; With max resist I usually resist every one.
---
With 315 (max) resistance, you only have 75% chance to resist the knockback. It is likely that it is hitting 3 other people and therefore not affecting you. Resisting the knockback has no effect on the threat wipe, that happens no matter what.
---
What kind of wordcraft are you attempting here? My context is in rerolling PvE, like I did, it’s been great. There are numerous PvE servers to choose from. I can always go back to my pvp char if things settle down, but I don’t have time to get ganked time and time again, I’m not that into wpvp these days.
---
Nah he's less obsessed with Asmon than you are with Advertise.
---
Advertise has clips of Asmon getting the exact same thing too so I don't get it either, if it's a ban just for getting info from other people who may possibly be watching a stream then they all deserve a ban?
---
I know, that's why it's mentioned up there. I apologize if you felt like you had to click about the stuff no one cares about. All in all my own RES filters would have kept this kind of shitposts out of my view by default.
---
&gt;Blizzard have some fuckin love for your game
---
they didn't know how to fix it THEN. they don't know how to fix it NOW

The thing is that Staysafe is a classic wow streamer. Sodapoppin is a variety streamer and one of the biggest streamers on twitch. He has a way broader audience than the lens of classic wow. Go check out Sodas numbers before classic came out.

WTF BIS for getting into BRD.
---
You could see herbs while you are dead.
---
You have already made great effort it reaching out to them.  A sincere apology, hold and an offer to try to fix it!  Don’t worry about it going forward.
---
Why does the idea of more balance PvP frighten you so much?
---
Welcome to world pvp s0n
---
Those are rookie numbers.
---
The stun resist on Orcs is a really popular reason to deem them the best PvP race for any class, which is fair.
---
But, it's debatable that Tauren warriors can be the strongest PvP race, if you run with an organized group, with heals and dispels. If you look at it from a potential standpoint, a few of the worst stuns can be dispelled, like Hammer of Justice, or all of them can be completely ignored with FAP.
---
The increased melee range, however, is something Orcs cannot ever have through a potion or buff (it's something like 7.6y vs 5y melee range, a 52% increase). Many ranged classes have more trouble fighting against tauren warriors because it is harder to get out of their melee range (ask any experienced druid or hunter). Warstomp contributes to Tauren's ability to stick to their target as well. It also gives you an extra spell interrupt to kill healers, which are usually the priority targets. If your team is the first to kill the enemy healer(s), you win 95% of the time. Granted, Orcs are good at this too, with Blood Fury burst.
---
Anyhow, there is a reason you see a ton of Tauren warriors on PvP servers. They're very good. A lot of people don't even realize how good they are due to the hidden melee range "racial". This became more widely accepted as overpowered when arenas were introduced in TBC, and people were really starting to analyze PvP at a scientific level. Their hitbox and range were reduced in late TBC or in Wrath I believe, to the same proportions as all other races because of the imbalance.
---
Really, the biggest inconvenience you face when rolling Tauren vs Orc is you don't get bonus weapon skill for PvE. But PvE content is so easy in vanilla it really doesn't matter. You'll just get edgemasters anyway, and they aren't that expensive on most servers.
---
After playing a tauren warrior for so long, I can't play Orc. The melee range feels so limited and no warstomp removes so much utility and killing power. I can totally understand a hardcore, long time Orc player having the same argument due to the stun resist. Ultimately both choices are good and you can't go wrong. Just don't go Troll for Arms PvP, that's really the only wrong choice for Horde.
---
I have an alternative take that servers with extremely imbalanced factions may actually become more of a disaster.
---
Alliance, even with crossrealm will always have faster que times as there are less of them. Servers with insane factiob differences will see the few alliance at 60 sitting in their town waiting for quick ques with simply no need to go anywhere else. The dominant faction will start "uber services" that summon people to the minority faction cities so they can que then go farm the cities. The dominant faction will also que and roam the open world unchallenged and beat any levelling player into the ground until they honestly probably will quit. It's essentially going to be the roaming now, without any of the minority 60s to defend because they're getting quick ques. 
---
If you're not 60 by the time these come out, and you're on the minority faction with big imbalance  (20/80), it's going to get worse for you, not better.
---
Edit: please remember that you compete with your faction for Honor standings. Not the opposite. You care what your faction does to compete, not the opposite.
---
You will see a meta emerge where people are looking to maximize honour as the dominate faction. Queuing, receiving a summon, and ganking at a critical point will be a widespread disaster that was never experience in Vanilla at this level of raw population and imbalance levels.
---
........ are you serious? Just wanted to jump on someone and be snarky at the first opportunity given eh? without realizing OP is a ghost you dumb fuck
---
Asmon personally attacked some of Advertises friends, Asmon was the one who started the entire only letting horde play when he wants them to shit. He bought it on himself.
---
I'm sorry you didn't get to experience vanilla :(
---
&gt;&gt; With flying mounts, everyone is a rogue.
---
&gt;So why don't you get on your flying mount then?
---
Great argument.
---
&gt;&gt;after that 3 seconds they are completely safe as you just fly straight up.
---
&gt;I mean, same with ground mounts since nobody can catch you once you're on yours, since they all go the same speed.
---
There's way more options to catch someone on a ground mount than flying. Are we even playing the same game?
---
&gt;&gt;More people traveling on the ground makes the world feel more alive.
---
&gt;Ah, so you want to completely remove a game mechanic because "muh feelz". Got it.
---
Yes. Exactly. Thats basically how we got classic in the first place, "the feelz".
---
The worst part is that I'm only a 34yo kid ! My parents are boomers, not me :( Sad.
---
Did you get disarmed?
---
Is it a fist weapon?
---
Always keep your fucken ony necklace in your backpack man. That's the rule.
---
i cant even imagine playing as a horde on an alliance dominated server
---
bgs are cross server and you don't even have the "at least i wont have queues" to fall back on for good feelings after you get buttfucked in the world 
---
you get buttfucked and you will have queues, horrendous
---
Like jerking off with sandpaper
---
No its not? You show up to a dungeon run in retail and don't know every single pull and how to optimize the speed run of the dungeon and you get flamed and harassed.
---
What happened to "reputation matters" in classic? If someone like asmon has such a reputation that he is being targeted then that's on him to not be such an asshat and not taunt the horde in the first place....
---
If someone gets a rep for ninja looting and no one will invite him and people group up to avoid inviting him to things should they all be banned for targeting him based on his rep too?
---
If it's so bad for asmon he can reroll and not stream and play in peace....
---
When all the alliance on your server leave what are you going to take your crippling depression out on?
---
The whole point of my post is why is there even an argument? What is so bad about having more balanced PvP? How come not one person can give a good reason against it. Just constant hivemind comments without any thought.

It's actually one of the better options for prebis forDPS warriors at this point in the content. Cadeverous/Savage Gladiator are better but that's it I think.

Keep an eye out for people needing a tank for scholo, can ask for the runes/greens and make 30-50g for a full run which if its a competent group should be an hour or less.

There's no reason to. Don't sap. Idk where you heard this from.
---
Doesn’t matter if you’re full t1 and the guys in greens if he’s using sappers faps and engineering  items. You can call it whatever you want but people who play this game the same amount and have similar gear levels get smashed if they don’t use consumes.
---
what? for calling a leech a leech in a comment thread?
---
&gt;My link proves that the population is over 3,500.
---
Posting a link from 16th of August doesn't prove anything in terms of current population. 
---
Guess what, since you preach Blizzard so much: 
---
Newman: Why not just open up more servers?
---
Hazzikostas: We are fairly sure — we can't know for sure without being fortune tellers, but most of them align — there will be a fairly steep drop off compared to that day one interest, and we want to make sure because of how important community is in Classic in particular, that we have healthy server populations.
---
If you had a bright idea to look the census addon data from the time realms were layered then sorry to disappoint, this idea wasn't so bright: any census addon data required upload from every layer. The data from p2 when layers were removed is relevant and accurate though. Look it up github yourself instead of throwing a tantrum here if you have any doubts.
---
If you really require to be spoonfed THIS much, okay, look closely:
---
Classic servers have been layered since launch. Heavily layered, like 4-5 layers per server. Each layer was about 3-4k people at once. This said, 1 server was able to fit 12-15k people spreaded evenly though 4-5 layers before queue kicked in. This is the number you embrace and whine about. Too bad, the population of servers has dropped (read above) and blizzard started to reduce the layers amount while slowly enlarging each layers capacity (it was dynamic after all).
---
And now we have ONE layer on EACH server with the server capacity of roughly 5-6k before queue kicks in on that. Because, I quote again:
---
Hazzikostas: Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds.
---
And it is.
---
Rust &amp; Scum. I'm the sicko over there.
---
Edit: FUCK!
---
What about my weekly "oops can i have a portal pls"?
---
Maybe he should have thought about the repercussions before he taunted the entire horde population on that server?
---
Activate Windows
---
2.1 changed itemization and raids pretty drastically in TBC. I played on a TBC private server that mimicked actual patch progression and the difference between pre-2.1 Karazhan and post-2.1 Karazhan was insane.
---
Haha thank you for the reply ^^ it's beautiful as it is too though ;)
---
Make yourself a goal.  It doesn’t even have to be about progression.  I’m collecting T0, the mats I can for 0.5, and I’m grinding to get exalted with AD and TB.
---
The worst one for me has to be the firepit at the warlock trainers under The Slaughtered Lamb in Stormwind,  damn thing is right next to you and there is no escape.
---
Damn I would’ve just played an alt until the 10th
---
that sounded like some harry potter shit lol
---
lol, too long, didn't read
---
He has not stream sniped is the problem, he has had others tell him the location of asmon and asmon is on stream getting fed info on advertise in the same way which makes no sense.
---
lol use heal rank 3 for the entire game. It gets full + healing power benefits and is the least mana cost heal.
---
Yeah maybe, but he makes plenty of $$$ anyway, it's what he does
---
You said it yourself, you put hundreds of hours into leveling, plus I'm sure a ton into raiding. Getting burned out with that many hours played isn't a surprise.
---
Check out Path of Exile. It's what Diablo 3 should have been and they have a new league starting soon. It's a great game and a good way to break up your gaming.
---
See, the problem is that the Horde was smart. We farmed gear and potions and gold for months while the Ally, at least on Faerlina, were all about trying to take over BRM and shit from us and get these massive PvP raids. Horde had no streamer or guild rallying a bunch of people to go raid Alliance for the most part. I don't think Horde even got a successful city raid off, while Alliance pulled like 3 or 4 successful city raids off.
---
Now that's biting them in the ass because while they were dicking around when PvP gave no reward, the Horde were biding their time and came out guns blazing come P2.
---
Definitely shitty and I’ve experienced similar, fortunately not often.  I like how many people start questioning you for posting this and laying out reasons that you might be the douchebag... which is lame.
---
I’m joining classic very late and i’d like to be a Shaman or an Hunter. Shaman look very appealing to me and have quite a bit of utility. Although, Hunters have always caught my eye. Any thoughts on how the play?
---
« I killed 10 mobs and this item with 10% drop chance didn’t drop, it’s broken!!! »
---
Probabilities....
---
Haha just like alliance keep saying something needs to be done about horde camping every square inch forcing them to corpse hop to get into dungeons
---
 NOW you’re really nailing that paladin spirit!

How do you know what 99% of people do? I have white cloth level 4 gloves with each type of +profession. If I'm leveling an alt, I can just keep the appropriate glove in my inventory and use it when I see something red. It's extremely useful.
---
&gt; Wouldn't you have the honorless target buff?
---
No. You are honorless only after landing on FlyPoint.  
---
&gt;I've literally never been attacked in IF before so I'm actually curious.  
---
I need to make a screenshot of skeleton chain right at the exit from Mage building in IF)
---
Or spirt rez it will spawns you in the zone you die
---
Unlike Alliance Horde can actually fix the massive population imbalances by rerolling to Alliance. Hordies keep saying how much you want to pvp, how you're the pvp faction etc but Horde choose to play on servers with massive advantage that end up being glorified PvE serves for Horde and literally unplayable for Alliance. And people do that because they want the power trip of killing someone with no chance to defend themselves while telling that person to "get good".
---
You'll get a lot of RNG is RNG, but honestly I feel like Blizzard has lost that polished defense many years ago...
---
50-60 dungeon mobs feel like they have boss like Parry / Dodge defense sheets.
---
If you think something is wrong, start collecting data under a sound premise . There's thousands of bugs in this game.
---
*Negative profit margin
---
Without any player names, this post is not very useful.
---
next pserver launch adn im out of here. This is unacceptable.
---
That's the only way which Blizz might pay attention to: good job!
---
Previously it would log all buffs applied to a character the instant he entered log range. This meant you would instantly see a player on Spy if he had literally any buff on him, maybe even an enchant, not sure. This was apparently a bug added in 8.0. Now it only reports buffs applied while the target is in your log range. Meaning that as long as no buffs are applied/expire, you will not show in the combat log.
---
"Why is your warrior in a gimp suit"
---
How can you provide that which does not exist?
---
This is not how the honor system was intended to be used they didnt drop the rewards expecting anyone to get it in a month. It was meant to be worked up to
---
When I don't go out to pvp (which is nearly impossible in a small group and I hate deathballs), I've been lvling my alt.  Who is now 60.  So I'm thinking of doing another alt.
---
Also other games or movies/tv/books.  Dont need to dedicate all my time to WoW, easy way to get burned out.
---
The sap allows for a proper reset, full energy, full hp etc. The gouge also isnt necessary, you can cheapshot and deoending on your initiative talent giving you 3 CP you can hemo x2 and still kidney before cheapshot breaks
---
Eh I honestly prefer DKP. Go to raids and get points, spend them on what you want. I mean I'm also the rogue who, other than the GM, has been raiding the longest with the guild/been to the most raids etc. 
---
Systems like SK can fail as, for example, if you took the T1 shoulders from Sulfuron and Rags drops Perditions? Suddenly it's going to the new rogue in greens and not the dagger rogue you'd had for months and hasn't shown any indication they'll be around two weeks from now.
---
I'm all for gearing up the raid as a whole, but you still need to reward those who put in the most effort in. I might be the best geared rogue in my guild right now, but I'm also going nowhere and will be helping the others gear up.. and they'll be doing it much cheaper as well.
---
Hmm, no. I'd agree if it's someone or a group of people killing someone over and over and over again just for sake of killing or harassing them, but this is not the case isn't it? A group of people attacking/defending a particular spot, that is, in this case, the boat, is... by any definition, world pvp. The poor guy just happens to be stuck in the middle of the battlefield. 
---
&gt; This bullshit needs to stop. 
---
No, it doesn't. Some things are inherently bad for the game, notably extreme faction imbalance (which I do agree that Blizzard needs to do something about), game breaking bugs/exploits, etc. But giving a heavy handed treatment by systematically prohibits people on how they can do pvp in a world pvp situation? I don't know about you, but I would never agree to that. There's *war* in the word **War**craft. If they don't like how people do pvp in world pvp, reroll on pve server, or just don't play the game.
---
Lol my guildee made a 29 twink rogue and blew up a ? Hunter in stv lastnight I didn't believe him but he screen shotted
---
He didn't even get streamsniped either....
---
This is the correct answer. I've leveled 6 main professions on my mage. Skinning/mining, drop skinning for tailoring, drop tailoring for gnomish, drop gnomish for goblin, drop mining for herbalism.
---
Always a skirmish going on in Hillsbrad. Been ranking pvp just fine with none of the ganking.
---
Depends on the server- Fairbanks is the complete opposite. Horde have raid groups all over the place and just stand around waiting for ganks at BRM, Menethil, ect.  
---
It doesn't really bother me so much, just takes a little extra time getting places.  
---
I don't see how there is any fun in standing in place for hours just waiting for people to come by like a trap door spider, though.
---
Obviously the game is rigged.
---
No they have no proof, he was actually banned for harassment.
---
And how do you just magically gain 4k more hp when the AQ set has less stam than t1? Did you bother to find items that will actually take you up to 12k? I was SL spec in vanilla and had a stam and SR set that I used to tank on twin emps. I had a little more than 8k and I had pretty much the best cloth stam/SR set there was.
---
Did you compare at all? For example:
---
 T1 chest gives 31 stam. T2.5 gives 23 stam. The next highest stam chest out of AQ is 23 stam. 
---
The T1 helm is 27 stam.  T2.5 is 27 stam. There is no other cloth helm from AQ.
---
The T1 shoulders are 25 stam. T2.5 is 20 stam. The only other cloth shoulders from AQ give 20 stam. 
---
The T1 legs give 20 stam. T2.5 gives 28 stam. The next highest stam legs from AQ are 17. So in this case T2.5 is higher. 
---
The T1 boots are 23 stam. T2.5 is 20. Highest from AQ is 21 stam. 
---
T1 bracers are 18 stam. Highest in AQ is 10.
---
T1 belt is 18. Highest in AQ is 10.
---
T1 gloves are 18. Highest in AQ is 19. Woohoo another stam gain.
---
So maybe even if your idea of "AQ gear" is wearing all your T1 except gloves and legs, you'll still have only gained 90 hp. Where does the other 3910 hp come from?
---
Edit: I'll also take off of the table the fact that you would have to do 12k worth of damage to kill a SL lock with 8k hp. Based on your previous reply, you clearly weren't arguing this point.
---
Pve tauren are the best tanks.
---
Halloween wand?
---
Ok see the second paragraph is actually exactly how I thought the fight originally was anyways, I didnt realize this was not the case.
---
You are talking to one
---
And Gadgetzan, if you're an engineer.
---
No tests of wPvP past level 40 at a large scale during the beta gets this kind of situation.
---
Just reroll
---
We got perdition's in every raid before I switched to combat daggers. I have CHT in my MH and the other dagger rogue have 2x epic daggers each. Feels good man.
---
honorless target means nothing.
---
So true
---
What...
---
Raid logging is mostly all I did once I settled into Vanilla. The only difference is that in later phases there will be more raids to do.
---
Raid logging isn't that bad anyway, but that's where alts come in.
---
You need volumes for reports to be taken into account.
---
Yup got em, alot better than Kargath, fp to uc takes too long and is like 7s or something and if i want to go to org i have to go to grom anyway, and if i hearth from somewhere kargath is kinda inconvenient unless im going to BRM which i have a lot lately but now that i know theres a zzz inn in grom thats a looot better aha
---
Trolls get bow spec which is better for pulling
---
That's because Horde is for noobs.
---
For the love of God FARM GOLD and stockpile flasks and elixirs (or herbs for it for the space issues). Don't stack gold!
---
Come back during BWL and say thanks.
---
Locks are under represented in raids and they're fun as hell to play
---
Sadly you can literally 1 shot this thing in pvp is has very little hp
---
33%
---
Try Hard :D
---
While you're pretty much right in that there isn't much harm, but the fact that gameplay interactions are using these IDs in a way which results in these effects is kinda ridiculous. From a programmer perspective it makes total sense to simply check each id in order and if they are affected, but it should be pretty apparent that this will have adverse gameplay effects.
---
Again you proved me right you complete waste of air. You literally are stating your claim of servers being only  3,500 is incorrect. There is also ZERO evidence of most of what you said actually being true. You don’t know there was a severe decline in population and you are basing it solely off a website that very clearly has incorrect population amounts. 
---
Layers were removed because that was the plan for P2 all along. 
---
You’ve been proven wrong and tried to slightly pivot and redefine what you said to make it appear you were correct, while still being wrong. 
---
Man it must be tough for you in this world. You’ve proven time and time again you don’t have a single clue what you are talking about. You start with population is no more than 3,500 and now population is 5-6k. You’re all over the place. 
---
It’s frustrating when people develop an elitist attitude for absolutely no reason. 
---
Please go back and read your messages to see how badly you flip flopped because I’m not wasting my time trying to explain simple things to you any longer.
---
500 dkp is such a useless number to throw out when you dont give any context.
---
They knew how to fix it then - by adding battlegrounds.
---
    They did nerf the yard range at which it can read combat log and notify you of  "x" person. The thing in your situation is that you ran in visible range of him and I could be wrong but that appears in the combat long too and sends you a notification, because that still happens. 
---
    You notice it a ton as a rogue too because you bump into a lot of stealthed targets and sometimes its the reason why I even get to pull someone out of stealth first. Spy is busted still, its just not as obnoxious, im glad they atleast did something because week 1 it was just way too much.
---
Undead get cannibalize to save your healers mana
---
150g for that? Damn u got ripped off lol
---
Anime tiddies
---
I'm loving it also, but I'm in a different situation than you. I had a lot of time to indulge back in Vanilla. Now I have a fiance and a 6 month old daughter.  I'm a bit sad that my toons will never reach the prestige they held all those years ago lol.
---
This is a joke right. Alliance PVP racials in classic are so over powered that blizzard has nerfed them a half dozen times. Stealth. Stoneskin. Free trinket? Lmao so OP compared to shit horde racials.
---
&gt; not showing population statistics was the biggest fuck up ever. if you could see server balance before making a character i think a lot of this would have been avoided.
---
Quite the opposite.  
---
All this sites that where showing population balance broke that balance even further.  
---
Say thanks to Blizzard that they disabled it.
---
Not enough whining IMO
---
This is literally a load of crap thats still steaming in a cold winters morning.
---
Respecing only costs 1g for you?! Wow I must be doing something wrong. /s
---
I also think 2h weapons are a bad example as there is almost zero competition for them. Warriors generally have very little issue get 2 handers.
---
I don’t entirely agree with OP but I do think it’s a little silly having warriors needing on daggers over dagger spec rogues for MS rolls. And I really don’t think you can provide a logical argument against that. That’s the only item type I really have issues with though.
---
Edit: I still think it’s fair for sword rogues to roll on daggers though since they can easily switch to dagger spec if the dagger would provide more dps for them.
---
People like WPvP. Unfortunately, Classic’s WPvP sucks ass. So instead of rolling on a PvE server and having to fork over a fat wad of cash to transfer realms if Blizzard ever fixes it, you just.... play on the PvP server. And hope.
---
how does that fix world pvp?
---
are you an idiot
---
Disclaimer: im not hating on retail at all, if youcenjpy it 100% play it. Classic is all about the grind, wether it be gold for respec or rep for a different races mount etc. I completely understand there is a bit of a lack of content at this stage due to the schedule but as you mentioned, BGs arent to far away and BWL will add a good incentive to keep on that grind. 
---
If youre still loving the game but are unsure what to persure, have a look at the rep rewards for exalted with certain groups. There are some very cool trinkets amd gear that can be obtained and not a lot of people are willing to put the effort in which makes them rare amd usefull
---
I'd say shamans are better in team pvp but harder to play efficiently.
---
Paladins tools have long cooldowns and are easy to use. Shamans have very short cooldowns and has to pay attention on totems and interrupts all the time.
---
&gt;This bullshit needs to stop. Blizzard have some fuckin love for your game. At least put some civvies or guards on the ship.
---
No. **This** kind of bullshit complaints needs to stop. You don't wanna get stuck in a battlefield in a world pvp situation? well, don't play in a pvp server, it's that simple.
---
Systematically adding a *new* game mechanics that prohibits how people could do world pvp is never a good idea. What you've just described is just a situation where the poor guy was stuck in the middle of a battlefield, which was inherently what world PVP was designed for. It would be a different case if some group of people persistently chased him around just to kill him over and over again. That's griefing, a different problem entirely.
---
So don't take the boat? The phrase "go to retail" is actually quite relevant atm
---
Yeha aha we have a 19 twink guild we're ganking 30-45 people bad we kill them! Every class is twinkable so we have a pretty nice team rogue, priest, hunt, sham!
---
The reality is for everyone on a PvP server is that you're often gonna get ganked on the way to doing stuff. The journey to Scholomance is often more dangerous than the dungeon itself.
---
What does this even mean
---
I mean, I've just given up at this point, the months of "this is how onyxia always worked" made me sick. And there you go, a hotfix. 
---
"I always remember spamming demoralizing shout and easy dungeons like this". You still have idiots saying you can spam demo shout to maintain long term aggro on aoe mobs. 
---
"I remember demo shout spamming on nef"...No you don't, that was battle shout. 
---
"I remember demo shout spamming on twin emps"... No you don't, that was battle shout. 
---
Surgers in MC not functioning, boom hotfix... 90% of my guild was confused when the mob was functioning properly.
---
Garr is supposed to self detonate adds as he drops in health at a certain threshold, literally does the emote now, people overtly argue with me this never existed. Yet its on websites and its literally a live emote right now as I type this.
---
Golemegg dogs are supposed to drop aggro when on their current main target when Golemegg drops to a specific health threshold. No... One...ever....acknowledges that this doesn't work.
---
#nochanges movement was the unequivocal greatest thing that ever happened for Blizzard. It works in our favour for a majority of things but I gives an insanely comfy cushion to apathy for Blizzard for the rest. 
---
I don't care how anyone responds to me. But there's one truth, classicwow has been a net success, but this organization is years away from being in a position to provide us with an ounce of quality "classic plus" content.
---
Edit: I feel compelled to add this, "we're smarter than we were 15 years ago" only applies to min maxing gear and character power. I assure you, and promise you, that every single fight strategy  was optimized to the fullest extent of the best guilds dps thresholds. They had everything figured out, and understood the fights better than the majority of the current player base (with 15 years of gameplay). This is constantly thrown around like people had no clue about the strategies of boss fights by the end of the content...this is simply not the case.
---
Another point of value for 39 bracket is you can max engineering, and have maxed alchemy for transmutes and potions.
---
See now your getting it
---
Ive got 8k hours on poe lol yeah its an amazing game.

I still need some pre-raid bis gear from dungeons, but I spend time farming gold, gathering herbs for the guild, and running dungeons with guildies to help them get their bis gear. I play the game unselfishly and genuinely enjoy helping others.
---
no, i have two swords. and i was fighting tigers. ill pay more attention and see if its because im bein disarmed
---
&gt;Every time I log in I am so thankful that I get to play Vanilla WoW, my favorite game ever, something that I thought was lost to expansions forever.  
---
I'm on one of the very unbalanced PvP servers and it's destroying my will to login atm.  But because I don't want to lose out on the remainder of my classic experience, I'm rerolling on a more balanced server.  I'm leaving behind 2 60's and some 30's but my old realm is unplayable. If this new server doesn't work out, I dunno what I'll do.  I think a lot of people are in this sort of dilemma right now. They don't want to quit, but they can't really play on their servers atm.
---
I already have most of all the professions I have maxed out
---
So it's a rogue with a bow and Cleansed timberling heart from a quest in Teldrassil, nothing special.
---
Ive got tidal charm and arena master, im just waiting for bgs
---
Only my own experience of testing it while fishing and watching people run up to me with no warning from spy until they perform an action
---
You have to pay the toll
---
And healers get less honor. Honor only gets awarded in classic if you dealt damage. (Atleast in solo world pvp, hopefully BGs are different)
---
Nobody  cares twitchtard

You weren't aware that chat was actually a scrolling piece of paper?
---
You can scroll through and check out any one with John Staats. Every one is better than the last so you can't really go wrong, tons of cool stories and insider information.

You think you wanted to roll on a pvp server, but you didn't.
---
This is why I think not doing BC is bananas. BC was basically intended to be part of vanilla, it feels like a natural extension of vanilla to me.
---
Priest is the de facto healer for all content, with other classes generally having less versatility. You can heal dungeons 1-60 as shadow without issue, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Priests are one of the fastest xp/h levellers because they have virtually no downtime, but 90% of your DPS comes from wands so be aware that it may not *feel* very fast. 
---
Your talent selection priority is: Shadowform &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Spirit tap &gt; Wand spec &gt; Inner Focus. Go disc/shadow before 40, respec somewhere between 40-45 to shadow when it feels comfortable.
---
For race: on horde, troll is best pve and ok pvp while UD is best pvp. On alliance, dwarf is the objective best by a long shot. I didn't think I'd regret rolling human, but there's so many UD players that you're going to be envious of that fear &amp; poison immunity.
---
Stack spirit on your gear, learn the usage of your entire kit (both downranked spells &amp; utility like mind vis/soothe), and enjoy one of the most versatile and capable classes in the game.
---
not op but this is a pretty standard feral druid spec for leveling

---
That said, it really doesn’t matter unless you want to be in the top 1%
---
About now we could really use some ***grenades!***
---
Never. Get prio on raid loot you want from a guild. That's worth a lot to guilds that want to progress.
---
The deep run tram
---
Totally un biased comment coming through.
---
Glad to be of service!
---
The adds do not explode based on Garr's health. They blow up if the fight is too long (like 6+ minutes).
---
That is the true spirit!
---
Those bottom 2 or 3 are pretty bad compared to the top 2. Perhaps help them out with some advice? Also to get off 14 S&amp;D in 1 fight seems crazy. Spamming 2 pointers? New to MC and take a while to kill bosses I'm assuming? Bottom 2 guy do it early then totally stop. Maybe they died?
---
Looking back over my last log and I range from high 30% up time to high 80%. Depending on the boss. Most casts I had was 5 and that vrs majordomo. 4 vrs Rag and 3 vrs golemegg. We are killing these guys in around 1:20 for gole and 2:20s for other 2. I know I am very conscious about keeping it up. Perhaps this was a fight with a lot of movement or target swapping? I know I died during baron I think it was thus my low(30%) uptime 
---
 I usually start with a 2pt s&amp;d. Work to a 5pts&amp;d Then 5pt evis. Then usually another 4 or 5 pt S&amp;D then another evis and another S&amp;D followed by evis and boss is dead. 
---
I mained rogue in vanilla. I wasn't a firm believer in S&amp;D at the start. Wasn't until a guildmate showed me the difference that I learned. Perhaps these guys are new to rogue and don't know any better? Take the time to educate them and it makes them better.
---
people play this game without watching a movie or listening to music at same time??
---
There is a usefull trinket in from timbermaw exalted and if youre horde but not a troll and you dont habe a raptor, youre doing it wrong haha
---
Completely agree. I love PvP but the general lack of RP is starting to get to me.
---
&gt;You literally are stating your claim of servers being only 3,500 is incorrect.
---
That's the actual amount of concurrent players online on some servers.
---
&gt;You don’t know there was a severe decline in population
---
Blizzard expected that, read the quotes. People moving to new servers helped that, what do you think?
---
&gt;There is also ZERO evidence of most of what you said actually being true.
---
Except facts and numbers but a true denialer like you will just handwave it, right?
---
&gt;Layers were removed because that was the plan for P2 all along.
---
Yeah and somehow I don't see 15k queue, right? I bet you don't see it either.
---
&gt;You start with population is no more than 3,500
---
Average statistical data for most servers supports that indeed. For your server in fact as well.
---
&gt;now population is 5-6k
---
That's the server cap I expect before queue starts to kick in. Works for streamer realm at the very least. The fact you somehow confuse it with current online population of your realm only proves your reading comprehension being zero which is genuinely sad.
---
&gt;Man it must be tough for you in this world.
---
I don't know, if we talk about world of warcraft it looks I definitely have it easier and better than you. Do you really want to make an emphasis on it?
---
Look at all your blabbing yet you failed to produce any actual source or value to support it. Pathetic.
---
But... surprise reckbombs... xD
---
Lol
---
For the millionth time, stop playing in PvP servers. It's clearly not for everyone.
---
As a caveat to this, Guards won't proc these types of effect, as they don't award Experience or Honor under any circumstance. Can't get a soul shard off of a guard :(
---
Do I really need to explain it?
---
Clearly your opinion is kind of moot since you’re on a 60/40 realm, don’t you think? It’s looking and feeling like a 90/10 realm on Stalagg, and it’s really kind of impossible to do anything if you’re not rolling 4 raids deep into BRM during raid night.
---
Idk if this post is time consuming lol. It would take 5 minutes tops.

Ungoro is the loudest. Visibility plummets too.

Most of my friends rolled on a pvp server. I think whitemane. I rolled on Atiesh. Which so far is alliance leaning but its a pretty chill server regardless( Im horde.)
---
Every time I’d hop into discord to see what they were up to. 60% of the time they were dealing with a pvp related issue. And generally would be frustrated about it. 
---
Not a single one of them is playing anymore. They all got to around level 30 and they were done. It was kinda funny because they made fun of me for joining a pve server. 
---
World of Warcraft was never balanced around world pvp. It was balanced around its quests and pve content. There is a video of developers talking about how they added pvp as an afterthought when they had some fun with it. 
---
There is nothing balanced about it. Thats why you can end up in a cycle of dying and missing a boat for 3 hours. Or have a group of people wait at flight paths to kill you for honor. Or to just kill you for fun. 
---
Blizzard should at the bare minimum offer server transfers to pve servers. Or offer free faction changes to the side thats low pop though.
---
ever heard of a thing called autorun?
---
Rank 11 raptor baby, dont need to waste time turning in runecloth.

Favorite part of this is party chat.  Thanks for ruiningToy Story for me.
---
Honestly I would, but I've learned over the years some people just don't like advice, especially when it's coming from someone who's not even a raider (still levelling, not got much time these days), one of those being the so-called class leader which tends to question every comment I make like I threaten his rank or something. I will always help someone who asks, many people who know me in-game know that.
---
ok boomer pvp hapend on pvp server should have rolled pve omg go to retail for free epics this is what classic experience is haha i soiled by underpants you noob
---
Wrong. Be alliance, fly to TP. Get killed when you land. Spawn at bottom of hill, die to people camping there. Spawn, run 40 feet, die to people roaming. Spawn, get half way to door of BRM from TP. Die. Spawn and die 3 more times as you approach door of BRM which has a steady flow of horde spaced at about 20 feet always running in. They’re not camping just outside the portal, or only in BRM - it’s literally the entire way.
---
You can't use flight form in combat.

I'm a Combat Swords rogue and just got Vis'kag. I presume this should be my MH weapon for big SS hits, but what about the offhand? I don't have Brutality Blade yet, but do have:
---
Dal'Rends Sacred Charge
---
Dal'Rend's Tribal Guardian
---
Mirah's Song
---
Thrash Blade
---
Equipping Vis'kag after using Dal'Rends was a drop in AP and crit, due to losing the stats and set bonus, but Vis'kag does hit like a truck.
---
I'm thinking Mirah's Song for OH? Any advice, thanks.
---
Sorta, you can just run onto the Zep naked and die, then rez when it zones and now your ready to go
---
Wpvp, alts, farming, fishing, help lowbies, rep grinds, roleplay, duel. Twinks and/or ironmen could pass time.

Gadgetzan is so fucking terrifying and fun right now. everytime i go to farm i pre-shield before hearthing in and immediately mount and run past horde FP. usually everyone is too busy to chase but somwtimes vigilant horde will try to chase. so i just dismount and sheep them. i also save my faps for when i get to zf entrance cause theres usually some there.
---
Tbf I don't think C++ actually has native a UUID library, even now. The notion that player IDs are incremental over being random is still concerning though, but I guess it could be targeting "in order of of lowest to highest GUID", even if those GUIDS weren't assigned based on the order in which those characters were made.
---
They do drop from both, and both are chests without the need/greed roll mechanic. So whichever one you can find groups for. There are some librams that need mats from the coffer, so you might find farm groups that way.
---
The only PvP server that was ever actually close to 50/50 was Grobbulus, and even that one feels shitty.
---
the server imbalance is only a real issue on like 5 servers, the rest of them are fine. 60/40 is the usual balance you should expect and is manageable, the less populous side has to be more organized but its not unplayable. Yes people on skeram, stalagg, heartseeker and gehennas are fucked. That's a shame, but its 4 servers. they should ttransfer out or restart and not ruin things for the rest of us with their kvetching
---
Warlock alchemist. Maybe spriest
---
Putting aside that this is exactly my plan haha its still not as cool :P
---
Literally read that post again.
---
He could have a million dkp for all I know. Or 501 who knows?
---
Did Ragnaros impregnate you twice?
---
When you are so upset about it you make a post on reddit about it
---
Thanks for your understanding but actually I'M A FUCKING GENERATION X which is coming with a complimentary premium tube.
---
its not at all hard to get exalted with gadgetzahn and booty bay, you just kill low level pirate mobs and for Gadget there's a repeatable turnin quest off loot from other low level mobs who also give rep for killing them. gadgetzhan is already a popular ganking spot, itwould be trivial for 60s to grind pirates for a few days then turn in all the pouches they got and hit exalted
---
&gt; It sucks, but PvP is PvP and I’m an HK. 
---
Don't let others tell you that this current gank-fest is PvP, what you experienced is something which was common in Classic PvP servers. Killing you in that situation was nether PvP nor Honorable.
---
You've encountered true and honourable PvP-ers. (rare)
---
nah I’ve seen them do it plenty of times
---
Sure.  On your server, maybe.  But it isn't always the same group, it all kind of blends together when there's multiple gank squads in SG or BS.
---
Gotta twist the guilds arm to go into the mountain in full force instead of trickling in like tasty honor snacks.
---
Happy Thanksgiving papa!
---
Yes, Undercity. The old door to Lordaeron king's throne and gap between zeppelin it's often camped by alliance groups.
---
Yes the heals are nice untill someone oneshots it.
---
I've been doing a halfassed gold grind of farming herbs in epl and killing mobs that drop stones with trinket for argent dawn rep. Pvp there has been relatively balanced and organic. Overall it's a been a good mix of gold/rep/honor
---
honestly this lmao
---
I certainly do have fun, thanks. I hoped you have fun too but 
---
&gt;But being alliance on Herod means I get camped virtually everywhere - horde essentially controls the world and get an entirely different experience than alliance gets.
---
there is a huge chance you aren't.
---
So not the exact same thing?
---
PM me :-)
---
It’s actually impossible to get to the boat I time unless you’re killed right when spawned to the new zone. Even then it’s close. You’re forced to spirit Rez.
---
Its a gamble, lets say vendor is 50s but it says 1g disenchant. You might get 1g or you might get 20s in mats, some items I have got lucky and lets say I got 2g from the example above.
---
I would reccomend DE the item if the difference is large and your not worried about losing the potential gold.
---
this only happens on a couple servers, not a problem
---
Do you have anything to gain from posting on reddit at all?
---
I recently acquired eskhanders right claw as an OT in MC, I'm an orc using axe of the deep woods, is it worth it to use the right claw in MC due to having no weapon skill for fist weapons. I currently have 6% hit, should I farm up to 9% hit and use it or just stick with axe of the deep woods and use the right claw in normal dungeons?
---
Cool that she lets ya play and jumps in other games though, got a winner!
---
So.. I've been playing horde during all that time? Because, as of today, there were 1k people connected on Alliance side. Reminded me of the end of the beta, back in June.
---
It would be boring, not putting him in after like 5-10 posts like that one would be evil.
---
You might be thinking of ranged vs melee - if the mob can reach you it takes 10% more threat to aggro, if the mob would have to run to you it takes 30% more threat to aggro.
---
More balanced PVP sounds great but you make it sound like Blizzard has a big balance button they're just refusing to press
---
Are your relevant weapon skills at the maximum level? At level 42 you can have a maximum of 210 of a weapon skill, if it's lower then you risk landing glancing blows on enemies of the same level which significantly reduces your damage output.
---
Thanks for taking the time to share this.
---
Only 35 runs?! Those are rookie numbers
---
&gt; Hmm, no. I'd agree if it's someone or a group of people killing someone over and over and over again just for sake of killing or harassing them, but this is not the case isn't it?
---
First, I don't know how you're assuming the intention of the people camping players on the boat... Their intention is irrelevant anyway. The result is the same, irrespective of what their intent is. Secondly, yes, that is *precisely* the case. They're killing people over and over and over again just for the sake of killing them. Often times well beyond the point that the player rewards any honour.
---
&gt; is... by any definition, world pvp
---
Yes this is something people seem to forget or fail to comprehend: several things can be true at once. Something could be considered "world pvp" by definition and also "griefing" by definition.
---
If blizzard shouldn't do anything about people griefing other players and preventing them from playing the game, why should they do anything about faction imbalance? Is that not "something that happens in war" sometimes?
---
Anyway, you can try to define it away from being griefing all you want, but from a business perspective, blizzard better figure their shit out real fast when it comes to griefers/faction imbalance, because they're losing subs.
---
the number of servers with a large horde advantage is equal to the number with a large alliance advantage, check out ironforge.pro for proof. its funny how people get so worked up over imaginary factions in a game lol. literally 3 servers are dominated by horde the other dozen pvp servers are mostly even. on my server horde and alliance trade control of BRM all the time and the alliance is always sitting outside Everlook/LHC flight path waiting to blow up horde who comes down.
---
&gt;**Behaviour**
---
&gt;Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect, and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behaviour is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
&gt;While we encourage you to report players that are behaving in a disrespectful manner, falsely reporting another player with the sole intent of restricting their gameplay is also unacceptable, and will result in penalties to your account.
---
https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/42673
---
That's basically the only recent source we have for any form of definition in Blizzard's own words.
---
In WoW, especially world PvP, you can consider griefing as such when the person affected by it loses their enjoyment playing the game. Best example being excessive corpse camping where your only chances to get out are to quit playing for the moment or to log onto an alt to evade the camper(s). Involving a third party to help you on the other hand I think still falls under the regular world pvp. And that comes from someone who absolutely despises world pvp in WoW and MMORPGs in general.
---
Can't make another toon, tho. notlikethis
---
PLUS, I just got through telling you, his proxy stream-snipers ARE ON THE VIDEO TELLING ADVERTISE THEY FOUND HIM.
---
That is the mark of a good player. Strength doesn't need to flex.
---
Riiiiiight...
---
True, but more on horde since there are more horde players.
---
People didn't go on ZT for an easy ride, they did it to avoid the queues on release.
---
Hunters solo dire maul tribute runs..
---
Edit: dmt means dire maul tribute
---
Playing 18 hours a day 7 days a week and still not getting bracket 1
---
I be going insane too
---
Even with 1:1 ratio most world PvP fights will be unfair.
---
The joke is, you said to not quote you..
---
Herb bank alt, yo.
---
Ah is that how it is?  I guess I was misremembering the details.
---
Just a FYI blizzard won't help you give an item to another player... They litterly said they wouldnt
---
Been trying to find that file myself, please do share.
---
Too late, I already reported him for wanting to play a warrior that's not an orc.
---
nice goal post moving
---
The vendor price depends on the armor type, item slot and level, while what it disenchants to depends on whether it's a weapon or armor, and what level bracket it's in. A plate chest vendors for more than cloth bracers, but DE the same; 2hs vendor for more than 1hs, but DE the same.
---
It's not a torrent, but it doesn't even matter
---
What happens when an unbreakable Shaman meets an invincible Paladin?
---
Watch out, this is vintage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6eIet7QRpo
---
is there a blue post in regards to this?
---
All I want is "at least lube me up before you fuck me" translated from both sides.
---
Well then I would recommend  [https://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-Official-Chelsea-Monroe-Cassel/dp/160887804X](https://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-Official-Chelsea-Monroe-Cassel/dp/160887804X) for some more glorious dishes
---
Not during Wpvp
---
ok i see the number but what does it even mean haha. is just randomly assigned?
---
Cowardly Alliance! I play mainly on PVE server now and nobody would fight while levelling, even if I flagged up and followed and emote/duel spammed them. I'm sure there are plenty of bad horde but the fear from Alliance players is unreal
---
Mission accomplished! Yarr!
---
FYI it is super easy to get off the boat, if you get stuck it's your fault for being stupid.
---
No not really just venting
---
75g is more than enough.  They can pay a hunter 30 of it to solo farm the hauberk for them
---
&gt;Wrath of Ragnaros wipes the threat of EVERYONE in the room by 100% irregardless of if you're hit or not
---
     
---
-----
---
&gt; and to top it off, only 3 people are hit by it in order of of lowest to highest GUID
---
The first half of your sentence contradicts the second half. Can you explain please?
---
Pretty much, the only better head slots are an engineering item or a world drop.
---
Would like to know as well
---
That's awful reasoning.
---
What is the difference between + healings spells and + spells and effects?
---
This is a very strange, I dare to say retail mindset. Yea - it takes time to gear 40 people. There’s no other epic gear besides random drops from MC/Ony. That’s classic. If you’re not enjoying your literally ONE raid night per week just hanging with the guild, you should find a new guild tbh. The loot will come eventually. You may not get every item you want but, idk what you are expecting here.
---
Can't you idk just not play for 3 days?
---
Well, it's a non-issue for me then: I don't do raiding. I don't like the mindset of most raiders: it's always a contest for who has the biggest dick or the one who has always right.
---
But honestly, esthetic is more important for me than the stats of the gear.
---
Da faq you talking about? You clearly different play vanilla either homes.
---
The 75g more than made it right man. If you want tips for the solo feel free to ask
---
Neither of which is priest. Meegss is a hunter and Secksy is a paladin.
---
*gets picked on at school*
---
*rushes home to watch anime play games and post on reddit*
---
*gets corpse camped by superior horde and caller a loser on Reddit*
---
There’s only one option left for you.  Do I need to say it.
---
"what?? You don't play the game in my personal fashion? How can you even???"
---
Might wanna get a Jokerlike forehead tattoo with *IGNORANT*
---
The real shocking thing here is that you have a goddamn Crystal Adorned Crown equipped. Lucky dog!!!!
---
Remake pre-NGE SWG
---
Mara is as far as I can reliably go solo.  I can do some bosses in Dire Maul solo as well, but their drop rates suck and I die a lot too, so it isn't profitable.
---
Yup. LB travels very slowly and chain lightning only has a 1.5s cast time if you spec 30 points into elemental tree.
---
Hey this is jerry from the WoW team. Unfortunately we are looking a little strapped for cash this holiday season, please pre-purchase World of Warcraft Shadowlands or pop open a few overwatch crates and your chat should be working fine as soon as you relog.
---
Regards, Jerry
---
I wouldn’t call like 3 on either faction a shitload
---
When you say rotate taunts - do you mean taking turns taunting whenever it’s off cooldown or taking turns taunting after each wrath?
---
Is there not such a thing as taunt getting less effective/he gets immune the more it’s used? (Asking cause my guild is struggling with the tanking and all us melee dps end up lying on the ground when he dies)
---
Seems pretty good. Not as obliterating as getting good windfury RNG, but it's reliable and ranged. I can understand the appeal behind it.
---
I'm gonna switch to Elemental + Enhancement eventually. Right now I'm still enjoying the meme-tastic experience of FAP + rocket boots + windfury hits. Also I think Elemental is more gear-dependent than Enhancement? I mean, as long as you've got a good 2-hander weapon, you can otherwise go in naked as Enh and still do decent.
---
My server is 64:36 and it can’t even make your list as being horde dominated, that’s almost double the amount of horde and you think that’s a fine ratio?
---
It’s so obvious who the horde players are from the replies. Just admit you need a crutch of having double the player base to feel like a hero and we can move on.
---
Try adding your weapon swap to your stealth macro instead of your ambush macro.
---
Massively agree, healing is super fun in pvp.
---
You've clearly demonstrated that isn't something you would have first hand knowledge of
---
I always liked blades edge. Am I crazy?
---
Fly low so they don't have time to exit combat and transform before they hit the ground.
---
Yeah probably
---
are you serious?  Literally everyone?
---
Ok so what was wrong with them?
---
I don't know why you guys are so salty you didn't get to play vanilla...
---
I hear ya buddy. This profession sucks!
---
(Nobody tell this guy how much money we’re making selling him GFPP! 😛)
---
Well then just acquire more best gear Shamans! I've seen enhancement Shaman soloing their way across Stormwind in 2005 before Blizzard decided it was an issue. Bring it back.
---
I remember getting ganked all the time on the boat on destromath. Ain't no different today. You just need to get better kid.
---
I got corpse camped by a 60 hunter in Charred Vale on my 29 shaman.
---
Another 60 hunter popping invis pots and killing lowbies in Shadowprey Village.
---
Just generally getting killed a lot by 60s who don’t even get honor for killing me.
---
Trust me, some Alliance on Mograine ain’t better.
---
Sincerely a lvl 35 Shaman on Mograine EU.
---
And it'll exist in TBC Classic. I'll wait for that, thanks. ;)
---
lulwut.
---
Shock is hot garbage.
---
Its 100% accurate
---
Oh so that explains why that hunter took Hand Of Justice from me, claiming that he didn’t realize it was a melee proc
---
Top of bank, top of AH, near the backdoor at the valley of spirit where mages port lands, actually, the only places where there's guards that matters in Org is the front gate.
---
My server is 55/45 lol. What server are you on, i would say that's somewhat dominated but 60/40 balance is usual on a server. 
---
its so obvious who are the salty nerds who care too much about a video game rofl get a life loser
---
Who's she married to? Dont see a ring on it.
---
Do crafted epics D/E into nexus crystals?  Could I collect a bunch of mats and basically craft nexus crystals after patch?
---
When does the funny/interesting part of the clip begin?
---
Mage hehe
---
&gt;Paid transfers should be an option
---
You want to pay blizzard more money because you’re suffering from their fuck up?
---
Free transfers pvp &gt; pve should be available to all and blizzard should compensate players who have had their experience ruined and time wasted by the terrible design approach should be compensated.
---
I was hoping this would be their reactions when they see 75g and a sincere apology in their mail.
---
I have.
---
That said I don't see much of a bot problem.  More so people wanting to multi box and doing a really bad job at it.
---
&gt; Otherwise you just get kited and die
---
And how is warrior any diferent?
---
its okay i got -8 votes because i told the truth :\^)
---
He isn't in classic at least. We taunt him constantly.
---
Farm bats in EPL
---
I’m dual wielding one handed swords right now, and my skill level with them is 185. I’ll level it to 210 and see if helps. Thanks.
---
Someone will prolly tell me I'm wrong but I tested this out and you seem to lose your reck stacks when you change weapon (eg: from sword/shield -&gt; 2hander.  This wasn't the case in vanilla I'm pretty sure, at least when I played holy pally around before naxx patch... but it seems to be the case on classic.  Perhaps I'm just fucking it up somehow.  But if this is the case, then the holy reckoning spec is kinda fucked imo.
---
Haha it'll be way more than that.
---
LB has a base cast time of 2.5s and crits for 1100 if you have zero spellpower gear when you talent it. It makes windfury seem really lackluster. The crit chance after talents is pretty easy to push to 20% too.
---
It's fun to double crit for 3000 damage.
---
A healing spell is the act of applying a healing effect.
---
There is no difference. Don't overthink it.
---
Holy shit I'm a dumbass. Thank you.
---
There are guards at Ratchet fp. I watched a lock get knocked back into the water a few days ago.
---
Idk, seems pretty accurate
---
FUCK GNOMES
---
Good thing all of that still exists from 58-70! It's not like people are given a 280% mount as soon as they step through the Dark Portal...
---
He came at you with thought and logic. Crazy huh? All you complainers just expect to make it to brm solo. Please, just quit or play pve.
---
Are Edgemasters any good for tanking? I'm a Nelf warr without an epic mount atm, sort of shoehorned into DPSing until I can get tank off-spec stuff to play how i want. wondering if its worth investing 300g into them?
---
My pre-bis is blocky, I have things like HoJ and UBRS bracers, but most slots are subpar.
---
are you implying wpvp is riveting?
---
Orbs or 50g+ on Thunderfury
---
Compared to what alternative? Its like. Free shitty health pot every 30 seconds. I've gotten countless killing blows and saved many lives with holy shock.
---
So not only are you lying about playing vanilla, you're also claiming you can 1v20 people... K. You're not even old enough to have played vanilla you silly little shit
---
Only thing better is SGC. Nonetheless, this piece is way easier to get.
---
Like 25s on a good day?
---
Virgin pvpers, on a pvp realm? Sooooo... I'm... Having trouble.... Just can't spot it...
---
I could definitely be wrong because of how long it's been, it could have been changed since I killed him (don't think we did MC much in later patches), or it could have been changed and I never noticed since we had him dead easily by that point, but interesting. I definitely don't remember him being tauntable, but also wouldn't trust a 14 year old memory.
---
Definitely decent odds I just forget though.
---
Honor calculations seem fine overall. It's just unclear when the day starts or ends.
---
Grats on R5. You're at the minimum breakpoint to hit R10.
---
I played an orc warrior tank from vanilla to legion, rolled a tauren warrior in classic and I honestly dont know how I ever lived without warstomp for tanking
---
 It so bad tbh. Boat from grom to UC and run. Maybe like 8 min tops. Gg
---
The fact that they weren't charging.
---
There is constant issues dude what are you on about? 
---
Pservers shut down for classic because they were just there to keep the game alive... It won't be long before they relaunch one because this shit aint playable.
---
That's the Classic experience, yes.
---
this sub is overrun by whiny alliance players from 3 servers with imbalances. that sucks for them but overall its not a big deal and its insane to think the game would have every single server balanced. most other servers are fine and competitive. pretty obvious if you are bad or dont like pvp you shouldn't play on the populated pvp servers its called common sense. and people just get too mad and come here to bitch because they can't win 10 v 1 and they aren't smart enough to avoid those situations like we can help out with that
---
Only alliance can say ok boomer.. so yeah nice lie
---
Bye, retail is without joking, more suited for u
---
For that amount of gold i would rather have a thunderfury
---
I’ve mentioned it before but it “bears” repeating. This trinket sucks ass. It is not good. It doesn’t fight well, it is weak as fuck, and it despawns quickly. Do not put yourself through the agony of farming this unless you are masochistic. I farmed it in Vanilla and only used it a few times because it was so bad.
---
Literally the best thing about this trinket isn’t the trinket itself, it’s when thrall spergs our and shouts in Org about what a great guy you are and then you get a bunch of whispers with people being like “wtf is going on”.
---
he will have it if he spawns fast enough and the cd resets if they dmg you
---
I got a binding but won’t get the 2nd one until we get sets for the tanks. Got 17xArcanite Bars so far.
---
Blacksmith with skeleton keys
---
There a couple main reasons. 1 is for the convenience of crafting your own sappers and whatnot, rather than finding someone to do it for you. Not a big deal, just helpful. Another is the trinket that has 6 uses can be used in the recipe to craft another one for less mats. So once you use all the charges, gnomish engineers have to buy a brand new one. Goblin engineers have another recipe that allows them to utilize the empty one, and it requires like half the mats. Gnomish death ray is the highest level gnomish item, and it can be crafted at 240. So your gnomish engineering will only be at 241 when you drop it, and those last 59 levels are a hefty portion of the cost of leveling it. I only play my mage and no other characters, so it makes sense for me to craft all the gnomish items, then instantly drop for goblin. For people who don't spend all their time on 1 character it's not as important. In the long run it saves me gold.
---
Quick fire and rapid fire increase the cast speed of aimed
---
&gt;*Another horde RPer!*
---
There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
It's pretty well known you lose it. Even without a 2h it can do a good bit of damage with righteousness. You can also just rock a 2h and heal. Not a huge loss in heal output for a good defensive damage. As heals you will get it up pretty quick when focused. Stun reckbomb sapper charge
---
Eh, not really? The meta on my server is to stack stamina/resistences anyway. My pvp gear I'll deal 600 damage per spell, my pve dps gear gives me 670. Not worth giving up 30% of my health for 10% extra damage.
---
Right now I can crit for 1500 on a single spell in my damage gear. About the same chance as a WF proc. The main reason to go ele/resto is for the 3% hit (all you need in pvp) and 5% crit chance from 20 points.
---
The ele/enh hybrid of jumping on any ranged classes and otherwise acting like an ele seems neat too if you can get a nice weapon like hand of rag to pair with it.
---
I play primarily on PVE server so people don't really flag outside of TM, but if you don't want to get ganked why roll on the "bad guy" side? The Alliance is evil lore wise, and every dead gnome is an act of righteousness
---
you think he's only getting 10 BL per month?  Also they sell for like 100g+
---
There's nothing inherently wrong with incremental identifiers. The problem here has nothing to do with how the GUIDs are created, it has to do with how they are used. If the GUIDs were completely random, you'd still have the 3 lowest GUIDs getting hit, which would still be the same 3 ppl every time. So the problem has to do with why the mechanics are using GUIDs to decide things in the first place.
---
It's a strange problem, because I think it's fair to say that the mechanics aren't intentionally checking for GUIDs in order to decide who gets hit from a list. I think it's more likely that this is a side effect of modern wow. Let's say modern wow automatically sorts these lists from lowest to highest GUID, then a classic mechanic tries to pick from the list without its own sorting.
---
The Onyxia fireball is a good example, because it applies damage to all targets hit, but then it only applies the threat reduction to index 1. If the list is sorted from lowest to highest GUID, then index 1 will always be the lowest GUID and they will get the threat reduction. However if the list is sorted based on threat or targeting, then the mechanic will suddenly work how it should.
---
Do you have patch note history for this. Didnt get to play back in classic so I didnt get to see it happen
---
I'd like to fuck some gnomes too.
---
I have a 56 mage on alliance and I have some basic addons. I’m wondering what are some other must haves or fun addons to get.
---
Some friends asked me what the PvP was like on the most Horde heavy US realm, Skeram (Close to 80/20, regarding level 60's), so I put this video together and uploaded it today.
---
Enjoy.
---
Yeah I’m confused, isn’t this fairly accurate?
---
Lol, come from the south?
---
Being in a guild that clears ony and mc in one night I get where you're coming from. Since I got quel'serrar(my last out of raid drop) and my guild doesnt really need 5 means at this point no one logs on outside raid nights, I've taken to leveling an alt mage to gold farm
---
I KNEW there was a reason you didn't just murder Garr with all the adds up, but I couldn't remember what it was. Had no clue on Golemagg, though.
---
Honestly, if they pulled the 1.12.1 code base, and the 1.12 database backup from right after BC shipped, I don't understand how so many raid boss scripts/mechanics just aren't working properly. (Like Ony, for example. Why don't we have the old behavior if they have the old scripts to copy from)
---
The only thing I can think of is that the boss scripts aren't in the database, but in the code itself, and since they manually ported old behavior into the Legion client, they just missed stuff from their boss fights from the reference client.
---
You could but it'd be a massive waste of your gold
---
Uhm 2 charges to gap close???? spammable long duration slow, spammable ranged aoe slow as well.
---
Disarm, Fear, interrupt, plenty of ways to gap close a target, then stick to them. 
---
We also can dump way more reliable danage when we do close the gap. 
---
When a shaman finally walks up to the enemy he is praying for a proc. When a warrior gets in he knows hes dumping a fat MS whirlwind overpower combo.
---
things we have to do to play a game after paying $15/month. lol. #Nochanges i guess
---
That’s not entirely true.  You can get pretty decked out with enough gold.  Plenty of guilds are already selling full MC clears of year.
---
As long as you're not too far from your corpse, you can see everything you could if you were a player.
---
Nah if horde grom gol would make more sense
---
Engi is such a cool profession; if only it weren't so aids to use on Druids lol
---
After each wrath of rag, set up a taunt rotation, tank 1, tank 2, tank 3... repeat.
---
There isn't a taunt effectiveness that I'm aware of.
---
Except that paladins &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shamans in AB.
---
Try to top everyone off and wait for 5+ seconds. Your mana will start to regen in combat and heal as late as possible to get the most regen in. Also can try to snipe a last hit with wand to trigger your spirit regen talent.
---
Everlook though?
---
There are not guards there. He must have put the pet on someone who was on the docks. The guards are strictly on the dock and not the town
---
They are aware of this and is being fixed. Reported it to a contact at Blizzard a while back.
---
Yes, that is how they got there.
---
They scale well with gear in PvP.  PvP is about burst while PvE is about elongated DPS
---
if you're a guild, why aren't you just putting someone on the ship to guard it on a rotation?  
---
why not ask 'who is going' and organise groups to go?  
---
It's really not an issue if you're in a guild.  
---
unless you're bad that is, in which case just git gud.
---
Its not an excuse if youre on that server tho
---
What kind of price to expect on Nexus?
---
Hahahah!
---
He's talking about having it for the invis pot... which was mentioned in the comment he replied to, unlike stealth lol
---
Try spamming LFG and not trade chat for better results.
---
I'm working on getting exalted with Argent Dawn. I don't want this to be my attunement when Naxx hits:  [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=9121](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=9121) . Furthermore, unlocking the Glacial set will be valuable too. Past that, I'm doing all the WPL / EPL quests as Shadow IOT get gold. Further than that, running dungeons to help other people is rewarding.
---
What might suck for you is that you only have 1 Spec, DPS (PVP or not). If you were a class like Warrior, you'd have DPS, Tank, PVP. Same for Priests, up to 3 sets as well.
---
There are multiple ways to fix the problem here, quiting the game would be the last resort. Just a little critical thinking and your out of this position. Too many people rolled pvp servers. Please, for the love of God, just roll pve. Stop posting. This has happened since vanilla. 
---
Hello kitty island adventure is what this kid needs.
---
Next time u see one just push ALT+F4
---
Hillsbrad I think is a great zone, but it can be dangerous on a PvP server.  
---
It has a lot of good quests leading into altarec mountains and dalaran.   
---
Arathi is right next door which I didn't really like but it's close, and big..
---
Late 30s I found badlands to be a really steady area. A lot of quests are just simple grinding on mobs looting items, it's all so densely packed that it's quick and easy to get a lot of XP.  
---
Tanaris is an awesome zone too for early-mid 40s. 
---
While there aren't many quests for it, scarlet monastery is steeped in lore and is an iconic instance with great loot, so I'd run each wing a few times at least
---
Alliance don't even have an equivalent the Grom Gol. Alliance have no means to traverse a contenent in one loading screen the way Horde can in Eastern Kingdoms, nor do we have an Alliance only Outpost in STV. You guys can literally go from Orgrimmar to UC to STV in 2 loading screens without touching a flight path. Just to get from Darnasus to IF, Alliance have to take 2 boats and run through 3 zones, one of which is contested. Having been a long time Alliance player, and just recently switching to Horde because of the issues with camping, the Horde have it unbelievably easy in comparison.
---
They haven't said anything about it.
---
*They thought they wanted it but they don't...*
---
Okay, so you go swords, then roll on daggers once perd drops, what happens when viskang drops?  Do you roll on it too and switch back to swords?  Or do you stay committed to daggers?
---
I only juggle a few abilities a rogue anyways vs the insanity of vanilla mage. Plus stealth activates a 2nd bar for me, so it helps
---
THis is vrey braVe and verry coowl
---
I went afk next to a waterfall and when I put my headphones back on I thought they were broken and making static noise. Spent at least 10 minutes trying to figure out the problem till I said fuck it and moved in WoW.
---
It wouldn’t work with that along. Faction queue with server transfers for the overpopulated faction to an underrepresented population would be needed. Also some sort of incentive would be beneficial, but not sure what would work best. 
---
Blizzard handled this so badly from the start for the pvp servers. Population caps should have been in place for accounts at the very beginning. 
---
The original server transfers were not well thought of at all either. Draw out a basic game theory chart and it’s freaking obvious that it wouldn’t solve issues at all.
---
Few more expansions.. :D
---
Depending on the healer, it may be better to be doing DME for preraid BiS and up to West when they gain another two levels. That being said, DM exp isn't as good as BRD for sure.
---
Oh Skeram
---
The private servers were able to pull this off with a handful of guys making the servers in their mom's basement
---
So I made a dwarf rogue and got him to 55 before realizing that I didn't like how he looked. I guess my question is, should I stick with him or reroll a rogue as a different race and have to slog through the levels again
---
So im looking to roll my horde alt and i honestly have been debating between ashbringer and ZT for a couple weeks. Both are relatively balanced in terms of ratio and Ashbringer is bigger.
---
What i cant figure out is how good the RP and PvP aspects of ZT horde are. The discords are dead regarding both aspects. I expect ZT to be alliance favored and im all for a fighting struggle. But as someone who hasnt done much RP before and is looking to casually do some here and there, is it worth rolling ZT over Ashbringer? :|
---
Disagree.  You just get focused and blown up.
---
Whoop there it is...
---
I actually don't know what it runs at. I haven't looked it's not really something I'm worried about at this point in my life anymore. I don't have the time to sink into games anymore I've got to much shit to do now. I've got a decent computer, built it probably 4-5 years ago. I run the game on classic settings as well so I'm sure the fps is high. I have played games on my friends system with insanely high fps and a 4k monitor wasn't a fan of it tbh. Just like the new 4k TV's they make me feel motion sick.
---
I did the exact thing!
---
This is awesome! Love community events like this! Considering making an alt to join in on all the fun!
---
im not sure about other classes, but you definetly dont use dps gear for disc priest pvp rofl.
---
just buy hanzo sword for like 20g and be done with it. or if you want to spend a bit more, use flurry axe. no need to spend upwards of 1000 gold if you're only tanking dungeons
---
I couldn't care one way or another but you realize that an anonymous user on a forum speaking on blizzards behalf is almost worthless, right?
---
this problem doesn't exist with personal loot. we each would have our own shot at the item.
---
If you don't like the game what are you doing here? Adding nothing to a discussion and being a grumpy bastard stops being cool when you're a teenager.
---
Yeah no worries, if it works for you then that's all that matters. I think the problem becomes evident only if you're used to higher frame rates, and then have to play with lower rates; that's when it becomes really noticeable and frustrating
---
How am I wrong? If you fly into thorium you’re clearly brain dead. You die at the gate die again to get to the ledge, die after the jump, die to get to BRD cave die outside of portal. Not saying I enjoy it but if you’re dying 14 times you are just bad at the game.
---
We banish what adds we can and then we have one tank move the rest to the wall. Ranged dps kill off the adds, melee stick to the boss.
---
And this sub is a reflection of the game, and especially of the most invested players. So the point stands, Horde specifically seeking out easy mode gameplay doesn't make me sympathetic to them.
---
Edit: Besides it's not like this is the first time someone pointed general differences between the Horde and the Alliance players, Horde players picked Horde for a reason and that's either to be the dominant faction on PvP servers or because Horde philosophy appeals to them, and Horde philosophy is all about being a giant douchebag, "strenght makes right", "if you're weak that's your problem" are both baked in to the Horde philosophy in universe.
---
it seems pretty standard to use t1 pieces for MC since they are overkill for the content anyways. Sure those blue are marginally better but it really barely matter.
---
Oh so you mean Reddit is exaggerating the "insane amount of Ally deaths because of world pvp" in the name of upvotes? Shocked.
---
I tried about 2 days ago. This is not accurate.
---
What addon shows the crit % in your character screen?
---
This amuses me because Horde on my server had 2-3 raids at Onyxia and BRD at any given time. Your group ain't doing shit on my server.
---
I hear that. It's basically going back and playing PlayStation 2 games.
---
I havent been to Gadgetzan after the night of phase 2 launch. Couldn't vendor items or even interact with the innkeeper without getting ganked.
---
I find it rather pathetic that these people would risk taking durability loss from dying to the guards just for maybe a dozen honor points (after splitting between several players). Just pathetic.
---
I am not speaking on their behalf, I am telling you what I know, they are aware and working on a fix, one that hopefully avoids any future scriping hickups with their current codebase and not just a fix to the Rag encounter script.
---
What does your talent build look like? And do you focus +dmg/healing gear?
---
Private servers were smart enough to time stamp items so if guilds did this it was pointless as they wouldn’t be nexus. I’m sure wow will do the same
---
Go to ungoro/silithus. I always find 1v1s or 1v2s there as gehennas horde
---
Dunno about your server bud but the profits on GFP's died out weeks ago on mine.
---
You can't just ticket and item across for your mistake. Those sell for ~35g on my server, so I think you're good.
---
Did you ever play Vanilla? If you did, you'd realize that the scale and pervasiveness of PvP was drastically different because there was 1/3 the server pops.
---
You got vis kag AND both dal rends? You lucky dog you
---
Being Horde on a PvP server is literally the same as playing on PvE server.
---
&gt;the number of servers with a large horde advantage is equal to the number with a large alliance advantage
---
And yet none of that has to do with the number of alliance vs horde
---
You can downvote me all day I don’t make the game I just play a priest and know how to get ganked over and over again.
---
Yeah it's really just griefing so that the griefers can get a power rush. But sadly a lot of those kids who do it (and who post in these forums) don't know how to have power over their own lives, and it's the only thing that hides the pain of their existence. But it never really solves the problem they have in their life, so they just spiral down into this radioactive shit culture of "pvp happened on a pvp server," and think that makes them somehow superior.
---
I know you said the "why" doesn't matter, but I'm genuinely curious. Why?
---
Every time I tried to hit the bridge, it threw me in to the ravine. Going for the portal always worked.
---
Do it! We'd love to have you!
---
Most likely they just grabbed the scripts from vanilla, completely disregarding the fact that the behavior of many function calls might be different in the legion engine than they were in the vanilla engine. That would explain a lot of the strange/broken behavior we see now.
---
&gt;Herod population is dependent on streamers
---
What? We were the designated non-strramer server
---
delet this
---
When people blame Horde, what they really blame is the dominant PvP faction which happens to be Horde on most servers. The Horde ganksquads on Kromcrush, Kirtonos and Sulfuras are just as bad for the game as the alliance ganksquads on Heartseeker.
---
People can blame Blizzard all they want, the ganksquads hold some responsibility. Blizzard isn't forcing them to be absolutely toxic towards the other faction.
---
The train driver in 1942 Germany was just doing his job... but that doesn't mean he can wash his hands off any responsibility.
---
Of course, it's just a game so people feel they're entitled to killing the opposing faction, but you can bet the same people that are dismissing the concerns of the Alliance (or more generally, the smaller faction of each server) are going to be crying all day on the forums when they have to wait 2-3 hours in queue for a single AV.
---
Haha, jumping off the boat and rezing at the healer is "getting good" at the game. Now I've heard it all. Better luck next time champ
---
If its true thats good news.
---
Works indefinitely as a human. If you jump off any object at all or even down a slight incline to will start the fall animation, then can keep tapping the movement to stay in that pose forever. Its good fun.
---
I’m 19/11/21 or 30/0/21. Full tier 1, kazzak belt. 100hp enchants, timeworn Mace, MC book, tank rings and neck. r3 back. 
---
Very decent damage output. I mix between offensive and defense. You don’t want to stack a TON of +dmg. But the spec is very much a survival spec. You rarely die. And you outlast every class in the game if you play it right. Shadow priest and lock are the hardest to play against.
---
If you go deep into balance, you stack more +dmg. Cause your starfire/moonfire will blow someone up.
---
Saw this coming, haven't subbed in a month or two. Won't sub until this travesty is fixed. Didn't even play Alliance.
---
TBC ruined pvp with the addition of resilience. Turned everyone in PVP gear in to target dummies. Even versatility in retail is better than resilience.
---
60:40 is literally 50% more horde. That’s fucking insane that you think that is balanced. 
---
How much are you nerds going to cry when WSG is 10v10 and you realise how bad you are at the game?
---
You will be going bear form anyway even with resto gear on. For if you don't, you'll be blown up when they inevitably close distance.
---
They were only charging people within melee distance, essentially making them not charge at all. The now fixed behavior is to charge the people not within melee distance.
---
I am definitely not gonna need on viskag with a perd already lmao, at that point you are definitely committed to your spec.
---
Trust me, I am just as concerned when it comes to BWL and future encounters ergo I slid in to some DM's.
---
Greater Fire Protection Potion
---
Haha yeah sorry I confused myself. I wrote priest instead of paladin.
---
They will be super cheap. Just think about how many useless epics drop per week from MC alone. Expensive early on, but price will drop pretty hard pretty quick imi
---
A big takeaway is people's memories are falliable, though.
---
Garr is the perfect example: he explodes mobs after 6 minutes as a soft enrage, which is exactly how it worked in 2006.  It has nothing to do with his health; this was a spurious relationship that people assumed was causal.  Including you, apparently.  It doesnt help some private servers also got this one wrong.
---
Garr works correctly on Classic WoW.
---
Your other 2 points are valid - but we got surgers fixed...  Like I dont understand your babyrage here - make a proper bug report on the proper forum or quit whining.
---
This is less true when you get higher.  At more +heal, it’s better to cast a lot of lower rank heals.  Tanks will take enough damage that you can’t really Regen, and your lower spells become more efficient. 
---
For leveling, a big perfectly matched heal followed by renew, followed by 15 sec of wanding (or as long as you can) is ideal.
---
That option is not possible and will never happen. There are too many variables to take into play that blizzard will never go extremely out of their way like that. Would you pick your blues you get, or would you be randomly assigned? It’s literally has 100 questions, and everytime you answer one, two more come up. Which is a headache just thinking about it
---
I think there's more people such as you crying about these hypothetical healers who demand recognition.
---
Do we really need to define excessive in the context of the example I mentioned above?
---
Once? Twice? Thrice? No.
---
Half a dozen times? I'd say yes, especially if it's the same person/people.
---
Anything past ~8 consecutive corpse camp kills? Definitely.
---
At that point in time even the resurrection timer takes ages. Of course, the resurrection at the spirit healer is always an option but what if even the graveyards are being camped? As mentioned above in the blizzard article the "unacceptable behavior" is determined by the players and blizzard, so everything is subjective.
---
Ok sounds about right. I'm only 56 atm in the moonglow heal spec. Was just wondering how far outside the efficient heal spec you had to go to be relevant. Worst part is losing charge it seems.
---
Arathi Highlands to study/relax to.
---
Tbh I agree with you, was just portraying how retail and classic are marketed right now, you yourself are paying for a retail subscription but only using it for classic because there is no classic only subscription. But blizzard sees that as a retail subscription that also plays classic. I don’t think blizzard have a big focus on the game in general due to this mentality from them. If they had classic only subscriptions I think they would have a shift in their support for the game. What I mean is that the chat delay is limited to a number of servers and doesn’t appear to be affecting retail at all ( also don’t pay retail so could be wrong) so this compares to the fact that they don’t have full focus on classic as it’s own game mean it is seen as a minor issue to blizzard thus being a small issue in the grand scheme of things. But from your prospective it makes it unplayable for yourself, so yes overall it is not a massive issue but it is a really big issues to those affected.
---
do hunters not exist? lol
---
if you have to ask these questions, you're never going to get the r14 weapons.
---
They’re the survival spec in tier A. The person behind the leaves.
---
Neat
---
Now ***THIS*** is the content I came here for
---
Any reason he couldnt use res sickness?
---
Alliance does this too...
---
or just one mage to root all the guards for 10 seconds. Lol.
---
I personally went with a Troll Shaman because my feet look like a nasty hooker camel toe - and that, my friend, is worth it.
---
yeah it's really not fun and i hate that i'm pumping time into it. i *really* hate killing 50s. The honor system turns people into a currency.
---
Only after TBC prepatch
---
Benidiction is great. Pretty sure ally ruled. But still close to 50/50. Getting ganked all the time as horde.
---
Moonglow is effective in wpvp. But you shouldn’t be rocking cloth healing gear if you want to PvP. Tier 1 is your best bet.
---
When you get dps warriors that are the opposite of the ones you described, they really stand out in my mind and impress me
---
what?
---
They had perfect attendance beforehand and were on a lot and helping others. They showed no signs of slowing down or quitting until after they got it :/
---
Play other games while raid logging.
---
That's also bullshit. If your raid is anything like mist raids, you'll spend 90% of your time casting flash heal. Which scales badly with +healing. Therefore the best thing you can do is stack int, which is plenty on tier 1. 
---
It's also bis for longer fights, like those in bwl. You don't gear for current, but next content.
---
Bro read my response to another comment i don’t want to practically copy and paste my response to them. I wasn’t trying to stick up for them just put things into perspective that was all.  I agree the chat issues is a huge issues from your perspective and yes there should be some sort of compensation for it.
---
EDIT: I know how to go back.. i just wanted to share their fabulous idea.
---
Might be because of the unique way Stealth works. The rogue doesn't exist to your client when stealthed. When you get close and can actually see him, the server sends all the informations about the rogue (name, lvl, race, buffs, etc) to your client. Your client basically creates the rogue from scratch, including the buffs, and will consider the rogue just entered stealth. That's why Spy detects them and that's also why we hear the stealth sound when we detect the rogue, originally it was supposed to play only when the rogue activates stealth.
---
I just take the double death, when you revive and die again on the boat in theramore, if you release and run back right away you can make it back and rez on the dock.
---
How many raids do you have going on at the same time lol.
---
It checks your mouseover target as well. It will not pick up passive enemy players otherwise.
---
comment you're replying to:
---
&gt;This is constantly thrown around like people had no clue about the strategies of boss fights **by the end of the content...** this is simply not the case. 
---
you:

&gt;looking at the **world first** rag
---
They're using an add-on that reveals the map, and the black patches are the places they haven't actually explored yet.
---
Irregardless is a redundancy.
---
Yeah. Those 15 hp and 25 mana really make all the difference.
---
Already posted this but fyi: Might be because of the unique way Stealth works. The rogue doesn't exist to your client when stealthed.

And how much do the Mats cost?
---
Think I Would rather got BRE instead of Axe
---
I transferred to earthfury and it only took me 10 mins. You might have to contact support.
---
when we went inside we were looking for peace but ouside we were looking for some fights.And also there was nobody to pvp with.
---
flows off the tongue better.
---
didn't even farm savage gladiator chain, you lightweight (:
---
I actually have a farm alt because I thought it out and it was more time efficient to level a mage and farm for 2 epic mounts and 4k gold for consumables so I can raidlog for quite awhile than to farm for 1 epic mount and 4k gold. The added benefit is that I get to help our b raid as winters chill without needing loot so our mages can progress faster

Oh another one of these memes.... how original
---
Get barman shanker
---
Use it for pvp. Keep dual wielding for pve
---
Well yes, they are bis in a way. As a tank you want to reach hitcap so when you're tanking you don't miss any of your abilities and in turn not generate any threat on that global. In simple terms Edgemasters are equal to 3% hit, so by having edgemasters you can wear less hitgear which usually tend to be on items that are not mitigation stat based.  So basically you can wear more tanky gear pieces and still be hitcapped becoming a more beefier and stronger tank.
---
However there is an alternative as a tank to skip the edgemasters and instead get the aged core leather gloves and use daggers.
---
There are plenty of spots in org where you can freely gank without dealing with a single guard.  Not to mention the place is so easy to get into with a wide open back door.  The mage portal area is especially easy to gank people.
---
Is bre better? Yes ofc. But spinal is still really good for pvp atm
---
Victory!
---
Maybe they're not christains.
---
Marginaler
---
Or lava. It sounds like hell itself.
---
it's better than any sort of prebis for pvp
---
Its not better than bre at anything
---
They will get rarer as Alli get embittered, I have lost all mercy
---
Ele/Resto spec does everything Enhancement does but better and has less weaknesses.
---
Enhancement is literally a meme specc compared to Ele/Resto
---
The prices of mats are basically the same as the pots themselves here.

But monopoly was invented by a Christian.
---
How are people getting groups max level?  Not sure if servers are more dead or just no one runs max dungeons.  Just seems to be taking forever to get groups.
---
I think what he means that, since humans have sword and mace racial, will it be alright in pvp to use the axe ? Which he also thinks it will be alright.. but in the pve aspect of the game, this human will need 3 more hit chance now, so he is wondering will that lower his dps etc ? Which i feel the same, because i looted Spinal last night and thinking the same things.. 
---
 
---
And yes i am a human warrior too..
---
Except if you get fed up with it, you can just take the zep to uc and fly.  The alliance boats to switch continents all pass through contested zones.  Also, the guards at the zeppelins are somewhat competent: 60s can deal with them, but they have to.  Horde can literally walk onto the boats in Menethil without being bothered.
---
How is this related to wow classic? It's a private server no?
---
im talking about follow/sub count you pepega
---
Anyone? I really need this! Lol
---
As a Druid player I came to complain about Druid placement as well.  Probably S tier.
---
Even Warlocks aren't that good against Druid if you have a lot of room to work with and keep large distance.
---
Good to know. Gear swap is free. Just dont want to keep swapping talents.
---
Gnomes are annoying AF
---
We have had a horde rogue on Kromkrush since P2 came out who literally is on hours every day. He stealth in If and will attack afl or mounted characters. He gets his one kill, dies, respawns, and then gets another kill. I can't imagine how that is fun
---
She takes it off when she rubs my feet.
---
But I would start tomorrow, do you think i would be to late starting classic? Also, how are hunters PvP wise as more content comes along?
---
To be honest I don't know?
---
I just like the idea of having things wider. I used to play a lot of CSGO like that. Plus I don't really like the high definition because it makes it feel to modern you know? The widescreen and the fact that it's shitty makes it that much better to play.
---
So how long do you stay committed to daggers at that point?  All of classic?  Until phase 3?  In my guild, you had to decide before raiding what you wanted to roll on as main spec.  Any changes from that spec (for raiding purposes) had to be cleared by the Guild Master and council.
---
Fuck entitled warriors dictating to everyone else to hold their hand.
---
im touching it now
---
In 2019, it's a 50/50. And I'm not a gambling man.
---
Otherwise pick up herbalism or mining and go for DM or Mara farm.. not sure how viable as a warrior tho
---
Yeah, but it has to be crafted after the 3rd use lol.
---
Do you know any addon to see the spawn times of the prince?
---
Kurinaxx is pretty balanced if you want to play alliance there
---
If you can only play maybe 2 hours a day at most, I'm not sure this game is for you.
---
Kek:)
---
Plus a lot of the tier gear is dope for aoe farming but shit for raiding. Mainly chest, shoulders, and belt. Legs would be a good one too, but they help hit that 3 piece breakpoint before most mages have their t2 pants. Same thing with gloves for mages who haven't farmed hands of power. Tell your raid lead you want those pieces for aoe farming, as at best your mages should only be looking at those pieces for supplemental fire resist gear, pvp gear, and 3 piece breakpoints prior to acquiring helm/boots/wrists.
---
*Gonna make a stupid image today because someone from the opposite faction killed me and /spit* - This subreddit everyday since honor dropped. This happens to everyone, from both sides. Get over it.
---
The thing is the windowed fullscreen World of Warcraft doesn't let you choose a resolution. Anyway round that?
---
The overall spread across all pvp servers is over 60% horde, classic racials just have too much going for them in regards to pvp advantages
---
I have 3 60s, all my guild plays on Atiesh but I started on Benediction and finished a druid there before I rerolled
---
This guy sums it up best
---
As a deep resto shaman I cant do shit. I can do things but only if I can get any casts off before I get gangbanged by 6 rouges and a warrior and the random dwarf spriest.
---
If you are fighting monsters your own level, then with 185 swords your attacks are effectively at level 37.
---
So it's basically like trying to attack a level 42 monster at level 37, you'll glancing/miss most of your attacks.
---
This is what classic is all about
---
This somehow reminded me of the breakfast club.
---
correct. he didn't have to stream snipe enough people were giving him free intel on where asmon was all the time.
---
how do you PROVE stream sniping in an mmorpg? how do you PROVE advertise was watching his stream at that time and not just getting intel from other people in game?
---
That’s because disc priest isn’t really casting a lot of damage spells. They have wand for that. 
---
Druids and shamans fill with moonfire/IS/wrath/starfire/roots or LB/CL/shocks. They get quite a bit of spell damage out of they want to. I know nothing about paladin healing PvP, but holy shock and judgment are no joke. I’m sure paladins benefit greatly from some spell damage as well.
---
Oh, I got confused by 
---
&gt;Think it’s okayish for pvp and Crap for pvp?
---
I think one of those was meant to be PvE.
---
I didn't mean a epeen lol.. Her hands are too small, that's *not* a man baby!
---
which is effectively the situation now. I mean, you can *roll* one. but you aren't going to be playing it much past 20.
---
Keeping them for my thunderfury
---
I'm curious if anyone remembers how it happened historically in Vanilla, I vaguely remember picking up enchanting on my mage in Vanilla and DE'ing epic I got VERY early (well before Nexus crystals were a thing) to get a nexus crystal.
---
But it's been so long that my memory could very well be wrong... But I figure they'll probably do the same thing they did in vanilla.
---
It definitely has a big balance problem, same with Stalagg. Everyone should agree that hopefully something could be done on ActiBlizz's end.
---
I can't use that yet.
---
Answer truthfully please; are you or are you not an undead rogue?
---
I'm experiencing the exact same problem and a friend of mine is as well. Don't have characters from the other faction on the server either.
---
I'm not sure that's true, i've never done the same dungeon more than twice on my way to 60 and have never had to grind mobs for xp. I just do quests.

Orc Hunter.

I pay for this product, I have a right to demand it works the way it’s intended too or be issues a refund. I’m not calling everyone a shill, I called one dude a shill for giving excuses on how something as essential as the chat can be broken. I should absolutely be allowed to talk shit about a company that’s putting out a sub par product that I pay for.
---
Only half that statement is true, because they are undisputably the best race for horde warriors overall. But you are not wasting time not being an orc. The only people who cares about your race are the top min maxers, and they wont play with you anyway. So dont care about them.
---
Yes an orc with axes and same gear, consumes and talents will outdps you. Should you care? No.
---
She's got a smart watch, they're into some kinky shit.
---
&gt; yike
---
Paladins want to use tier gear in PvP almost no matter what because it is plate, and most +healing gear is cloth, leather, or mail. You want to maximize the amount of plate gear you have since it really helps especially vs rogues and warriors
---
That's what I do as well, usually gets me pretty far.
---
Bew?
---
Of course but eventually everyone will have their flying...
---
&gt; Wrong. There's a lot of changes like gear and talents. Blizzard is picking and choosing what they want to change for the health of classic.
---
There is a big difference between changes like 'we're going to use the gear and talents from one patch' and changes like 'we're going to completely change how the honor system works and we're not going to let people play with their friends.'
---
&gt;Why did they not choose to prevent my realm from being 75% horde?
---
Do you actually want to know the answer to this question, or it this rhetorical? 
---
&gt;People said world PvP would be crazy, no one said blizzard would fuck up server balance so hard that one faction can play the game outside instances and one faction can't.
---
I recall tons of people, especially those from private servers, warning that there was going to be a ton of flight-path camping. 
---
And this may be a bitter pill to swallow, but faction balance doesn't change anything. 
---
If you're a level 60 trying to get to BRM, it literally doesn't matter if it's a 50/50 server or a 60/40 server or a 90/10 server. A group of players camping there is going to wallop you, because they want to fight and you don't. They're going to look to outnumber you and engage when they have the advantage. If the Horde has 10 players camping BRM and the Alliance has 10 players looking to go farm UBRS, the Alliance players are all going to die regardless of it being an even fight.
---
There's NOTHING stopping you from rassling up a full raid team and having your PvP fun even on a minority faction. Unless the dominant faction knows where you're going ahead of time and organizes multiple raids to get there ahead of you, you can get some awesome, quality World PvP in. 
---
It's when you *don't* want to PvP that you get fucked. That's a problem with world pvp in general, not faction balance.
---
you made the choice. now you need to choose again - stay on your pvp server, or start over.
---
there should be no pvp to pve server transfers. there should be consequences for your choices.
---
When you get some hit % and some decent weapons.
---
Haha yeah every realm is horde dominated I get the reference the irony of this isn’t palpable
---
There’s a rogue on Yojamba who has been doing the same thing the last 3 days. Half the time he doesn’t even get a kill. Some of us suspect he’s a bot, but god knows why someone would bother botting that.
---
Yeah there's a big difference between naming your character something like "Meatloaf"  and naming it something like "okboomer" or "lolyoudied" or "sneaksneakstabstab" or some shit.
---
Hell, I'm on a PvP server and when I'm forming a group for a dungeon I refuse to invite anyone with memes in their name *especially* if's that [adjective]y-Boi meme unless they're a healer/tank and I'm *really* desperate.
---
Fuck that meme and fuck everyone who uses it.
---
Create an alt on the imbalanced side, and try to level to 60 now. 
---
We'll wait.
---
This is going to save me a lot of time. Thanks.
---
I still havent found an item that keeps its buffs after being taken off.
---
Examples: orb of deception, skull of impending doom, nifty stopwatch, rocketboots. All of these give you a buff that disappears as the item is unequipped. 
---
However summons seem to stay, for example ancient cornerstone grimoire skelly stays around even if you uneqip the item. Havent tested with barovs, dragonling etc. 
---
As robes of insight give you a magical buff of having a free cast, i come to the conclusion it would probably not work.
---
Yep it's Bew
---
I've spent so many levels healing idiots in dungeons. You better believe I plan on going spooky form and melting some horde faces.
---
You can skin in shapeshift forms, but I would guess they wanted the RP to be an animal form could still do that with their claws, but wouldn't be able to pick a herb without destroying it, handle a mining pick etc.
---
They do simplify it a bit since proper GUIDs use the machine's MAC address to help prevent against collisions, but there's trade-offs involved. What's most likely happening is that they're letting the DB generate these IDs on an auto-incrementing sequence since it tends to be slightly more performant and allows them to need less storage altogether on the DB. When you have millions of accounts, each capable of holding up to 50 characters, with who knows how many tables needing to reference that ID as a foreign key, this will add up fast so you take any optimization you can get. Cross-Realm instancing (e.g. battlegrounds) can just mask each player's realm ID against the upper bits of the player's ID to keep unique IDs going.
---
And, at least at Vanilla launch, each DB server [supported multiple realms](https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9huows/ama_former_wow_developers_kevin_jordan_classes/e6esi97/), so there shouldn't be an issue with the DB server generating the IDs. I don't think the modern player count would have an effect on this considering server hardware has also advanced significantly since then (note: I'm talking about databases, which have heavily grown to take advantage of these hardware advancements. The game servers are a different story).
---
everything all right there
---
So are edgemasters.
