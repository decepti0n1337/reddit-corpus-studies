They people for it don't have a legitimate argument, so they just throw out a semantics red herring.   Whether or not you want to call it an exploit is irrelevant.   It shouldn't be allowed, because it breaks the game.
---
---
---
The idea of using the soul of a player, one YOU killed, to cast a spell is awesome lol.
---
In retail you press 2 buttons the whole day.
---
Yeah I mentioned the crit in my comment lol 
---

---
As for kill times you’re probably right for most people. 
---
My guild won’t let people raid without max engineering. I also mentioned that in my post too lol.
---
The dungeon route can be faster in certain level ranges, with certain group compositions if you have a dedicated group that are willing to spam the same dungeon for hours. They also do not do full clears after the quests are complete, instead farming mob dense sections, resetting and doing it over and over.
---
From memory it's not great xp/hr, but Winterspring is gorgeous.
---
You don't have to be such a douchbag about it, especially since they're right about it being the bis weapon for holy pally in phase 1. You're arguing something different but you aren't even explaining what exactly you're arguing (which is if it's a big enough upgrade to give to a pally over a caster dps)
---
facts
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
WTF do you call  50% raid dps and 30% raid health other than exploit?  What other term is there for it?
---
Hey, good tunes are good tunes
---
Nice.
---
World buffs aren't an exploit but are just way too powerful, I've been in guilds that clear Naxxramas in a few hours once world buffs are allowed to be used.
---
People see the Illumination talent and their instinct is to go *OMG crit = infinite mana!* forgetting the fact that Paladin is already the most mana efficient healer in the game.
---
Mana isn't the main issue for holy paladins, it's throughput. The only way you can consistently improve throughput is to stack bonus healing. There just isn't enough crit on gear to make crit paladin achieve anywhere close to the same HPS as +healing stacking paladin.
---
If you're going OOM it's not because of your gear, it's because something else went wrong.
---
This^ and also no mount.
---
Not by design
---
I knew the meme spec gif was gonna be crazy but I was not prepared. Almost gagged on my sidecar (the one with booze not wheels).
---
The post talks about it being a Paladin weapon. It’s not. 
---
If you want to debate something else that’s on you lol. 
---
Again this is not a Paladin weapon.
---
I’ll never stop being a douche bag to a douche bag lol
---
Grinding quests is one of the main ways you will level up. They added more quests to various towns and hubs and other areas in the different zones after the original game launched with certain content updates. Having more quests to pickup as you move through the zones leveling in your journey will end up giving you more exp for doing them. The thing that takes the longest in old wow is basically traveling. Sticking in leveling zones and clearing out every quest you can will help you reach 60 faster than trying move into each new zone as soon as you can and meet the minimum level requirement. The bulk amount of exp you get for quest rewards is well worth the few minutes that they take to finish.
---
2.4 WAS the highest rated in my Battlegroup rating inflation startet with WOTLK......so 2400 back then was 3k now
---
Let me guess, you think ragnaros wont die within 7 days?
---
With how the mobpathing works in the world I assume the boss pathing will work like expected. In teldrassil for example you can abuse roots and trees to force mobs to go on weird paths (they basically never reach you). 
---
They can however apply custom fixes to the boss so who knows if it will work.
---
Yea TBC put me into probation
---
Took this long to get someone who knows what they’re talking about to back me up lol. 
---
Thanks man, this sub is crazy lol
---
When choosing a class vannish seems awesome with kids. If you need to afk fast it's a perfect out.  With only some failure. I won't roll alliance at all so I don't know what to do.
---
2 for me. That’s where it started, and that’s where it stayed, until from my bars it was untimely ripped.
---
It's possible, but unlikely.  You would almost certainly need multiple people playing the characters, and even more farming mats.
---
We will clear it in five. Quote me on it.
---
If you're already comfortably rich I dont see why you wouldn't. For some people 100k wouldnt mean much, for others it would mean a lot.
---
This document does a LOT to prove my point. Look at the weapons and look at the Prot threat column as a baseline, since everyone is so “threat is all that matters” about everything.
---
Chromatically Tempered Sword has a value of 581.3, and is considered better than Edge of Chaps which has a value of 565.6. Look at the racial tab. The orc Axe bonus adds 115.4, so edge of Chaos in the hands of an Orc Prot Warrior is now valued at 681, making it the best horde tank weapon until mid Naxx. Better than AQR, conventionally considered to be a “better tank weapon”.  Weapon skill is a BIG GAME.
---
rofl

So who will make consumables, or ony cloak, cloak of the wild, lionhearted helm?
---
Sorry I modified my comment while you were responding, it was a little too harsh imo and I shouldn't have called you a douchbag
---
You don't *need* to win AB. You got rep ticks at certain resource amounts. I would just guard stables on my shadowmelded warrior and hope the rest of the team could take care of the rest. Easy rep for the amount of effort required.
---
Yea I did lots of questing there in my 50s lol loved that place. It’s like azeroth’s own jurassic park.
---
I don’t understand.
---
Do you think Engineering takes up two professions?
---
Yep, pug dungeons runs are not efficient at all. First there's the waiting for everyone to show up at the dungeon, which can easily take 30 minutes or more depending on where everyone is. Then there are the people who make the dungeon runs take longer than they should because they don't know how to optimally play their class. You also won't be squeezing every last bit of XP out of an dungeon by killing every mob. You'll mostly be taking the fasted route to each boss, sometimes skipping bosses to get to the last boss as quickly as possible. Then the group will disband and you'll have to spend time sending tells so you can refill the group and start this whole process again.
---
That said, I spend most of my time doing dungeons in vanilla because I find it much less boring than grinding mobs and questing. Just don't expect to be one of the first to level 60 you go this route.
---
Thanks
---
Yes, who do you think set that record?
---
Ah gotcha, no worries! 
---
Thank you for responding &lt;3

Flying. Sure, it was awesome at the time and I love a lot of those mounts, but it killed World PvP and my old means of exploring. Flying made the world feel small. I'm not keen on the megaserver thing I think the servers share now? People phasing in and out... Dailies are fine, in *moderation*. A daily grind to unlock another daily grind killed the game for me. Give me an extra max level zone I can work through, toss in a few dailies at the end but leave it at that. Don't make the entire end game for max levels be dailies.
---
who gives a shit?
---
O my bad - thought most of those professions would want to gather as well.
---
Is scholo doable pre 60?  I remember that place being a wipe fest
---
I understand that, which is why having quests and stuff take you back to old zones would be cool. But something like having to kill Ony and get ZG buffs and farm MCP (alongbwith any new world buffs that may be added) every week for multiple expansions would get old and imo silly.
---
Visiting and doing new stuff there (such as showing new development as time as passed), fine. Having to go back constantly (especially the farming of items), not so fine. IMO, of course.
---
Again, it's already been proven via testing that it's uptime is significant.
---
Even ignoring the stamina and looking at the spreadsheet, the overall value is better than Smoking Heart. And that's calculated at a 78% of the full contribution the stats give to account for any variation in the proc.
---
[The problem is you're overvaluing mitigation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2GjjkOR27c&amp;t=377s)
---
My literal life.
---
Hey there, thanks for the feedback! We fixed some errors based upon some of it (Hydrocane, Flurry Axe, Giantstalker's Belt) which is very helpful.  
---
Regarding the Warrior items you're mentioning though, those items were added to the MC loot table in Patch 1.4, which means Phase 2 as far as we currently know. Your search is filtered to Phase 1.
---
Yea priests (I'm a priest) will be sporting Benediction, we won't be taking the healing mace from druids/paladins.
---
thanks for posting this, kurthos :D
---
My Prot Warrior was named Sundercatz  
---
my /castsequence macro   yelled  SUNDER SUNDER SUNDER  as I stacked the sunders, then HOOOO  to let DPS know when to start
---
30/0/21 is one of the best PvP specs in the game, but the problem is that you have to raid to get the gear to support that spec. Hybrid itemization is complete garbage in vanilla so you can't just run a bunch of end-game 5-mans and get a nice mail-based 'starter' spell damage set. It's all geared toward healing or hunter DPS (agi).
---
This is...interesting. Most efficient/fastest healer in the game not MT healer and traded for armor buff on  that depended on priest crits (lulz). Most of the time we had priest running backup on MT/OT for coverage.  Paladins have devo aura and LoH for extra armor if needed - but that was rarely the case as MT/OT have gear priority and armor was never an issue.
---
I love how you defend your point with ‘serous guilds’.
---
Yep I’m 19
---
This. I have a buddy that will play classic some, but our schedules won’t align particularly well often enough. So he’ll level with my alt while I go as bonkers (or not) as I please on my alt. Let’s me not feel restricted.
---
I still do this as an adult.
---
You don't seem to know anything about the paladin healing meta yourself. NostalgiaSchmaltz has played a paladin from MC until Naxx, how much have you played paladin and how long ago was that? You brought up paladins not having multi-target heals or hots. Do you seriously think priests should heal the raid with aoe heals/hots?
---
Most of the time raid damage is very bursty, so you should have one priest throwing shields and paladins topping them off with Flash of Light. Priests with their armor increasing heals should primarily be healing the tanks, because paladins don't have armor increasing buffs in their heals.
---
PvP videos were for entertainment.  Vurtne was no better than any other PvP mage that knew how to play their class well.  Except the players early on were more impressive because gear was plain garbage back in the day.
---
You're the exact type of person competent loot councils are for.
---
Man I have a 1 year old, mortgage, got a temporary specialist promotion within my job which’ll see me get smashed with work and unsociable hours for the next 6 months...and a mrs that hates video games. 
---
I figure the baby gets to sleep by 8pm-ish, (if I’m home and not doing a 16 hr shift) I’ll just fireup the laptop and sit beside the Mrs on the couch and play/level my toon. If she goes out with the baby or is @ work and he’s asleep, I’ll go use my gaming pc.. try steal a couple of hours here and there.. pretty much have no chance but just gotta have a crack and do what you can
---
You gotta remember this game is hopefully going to be popular for the next 2-3 years - the babies will get older and start going to school/childcare and will become slightly less dependent on us. Chances are it will “get easier”
---
I played pretty hardcore up until my kid hit a year-ish old.  I'm a stay at home dad so nap time was awesome and I would normally get enough time to do some dungeons or quest.  She would go to sleep at five and I'd have from five to whenever to play.  Now she's a year and a half old and goes to sleep at eight with no nap times.    I also work exclusively on the weekends and am currently building a house. So game time is pretty non-existent atm. =(
---
You'll have plenty of time to play.  Just don't expect to have the same amount of time as she gets older.  When she starts toddling she'll start going to sleep later and your free time will get shorter and shorter.  This is all assuming you are in a similar situation to mine where I don't work as much as my S.O.
---
Go in blind and have a blast. Honestly there's nothing like exploring an MMO with 0 experience/knowledge. If I could wipe my brain for Classic WoW I would absolutely do it.
---
Find a friendly Guild that aren't too serious and enjoy yourself.
---
this is exactly what ive been looking for, replying to find and look at later. Thanks!
---
This and the commentary is hilarious! Made my Friday Way better 🥰
---
Shaman seems cool in concept to me, but totems seem really annoying to use. Constantly reapplying them due to short duration and limited radius.
---
just because fewer people cared/knew better, doesn't mean the terms were any less offensive.
---
It's better to do what you all want to do. Or maybe it's better to have fixed schedules for when you level characters together and then have other characters that you level when you cannot all get together. It's up to you to get together with your friends and arrange the maximum way to have fun
---
Just ignore the assburgers guy.  They seem to have a hard on commenting on how nothing done on Pservers is going to work on live.  I don't doubt that rag could be dead in 5 days, but your hardest part is going to be leveling up warriors at that point, which would take 5 days of play time to get there.  You're pretty much going to need to be doing a cleave/AoE dungeon farming to get the warriors up that quick.
---
I'm really interested though to see Pserver tactics and how they'll be working on classic.  Right now, the theory is there that they can all still be done.
---
You'd also want 3 sept and not october if you're chasing 5 days to kill rag
---
Or you can just keep leveling on your own when your friends can't make it and then when your friends are there you can just go back and play with them, and maybe experience of just playing with them will make you not worry quite so much that you are higher level and getting less experience
---
Man you are triggered going through all my replies. Yes I played and raided Naxx. Never needed to bring it up, as facts are just fine. There is no healer better at MT healing than paladin. This has been META since vanilla. 
---
Paladins raid healing is just fine - point is they are better MT healers.
---
Groups like that work ok if you get 5 neets. 5 people with families and hobbies yeah no chance they will stick together.
---
RP server players are allowed to go out of character, in fact, most are out of character much more often than not. RP server just means you get to RP if you want to, whereas it doesn't really exist in normal servers.
---
I would never play a tauren if the new models were in classic.
---
Hey there, if you can send me a screenshot that would be helpful, there should be no ads covering anywhere close to half of a screen. There should only be two mobile ads total, one stationary at the top and a small floating banner as seen in this screenshot. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/8HnPrju.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8HnPrju.jpg)
---
For desktop ads there are no ads in the content sections. There are floating ads outside of the content, an ad in the header, and very occasionally a video ad that has no sound in the bottom right. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/XAvOzVj.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/XAvOzVj.jpg)
---
Contrary to what many are saying here, there are no popups on the site, and we will never allow popups. We limit it to 3 ads here with the occasional video ad with no audio and keep it outside of the content.
---
There is alot of walking. You can take off time to go do class or professon stuff. Also it wont kill anyone to go quest by yourself. Its not like you will eclipse the group amd wont be able to play. Alot of quests are worst to do in a group.
---
I guess.  But then you've still got a road leading to redridge, and if you spent 2 weeks in elwynn/westfall, you'd be in your high teens and see that there aren't skull monsters in redridge.
---
Most body pulls are survivable though, if you are well geared. Not only do the mobs need time to run over to start applying dps, but you can lengthen this timeby moving the hunter's  pet away from the mobs. Even then, you probably are nowhere near zeroing your healer's mana on trash. 
---
Beyond that, you do have your emergency cooldowns, then your potions, and even after that, if things get desperate, you can start doing crazy shit like moving the pull way back and intimidating shouting.  
---
If you are paying attention to your gear, you usually have a LOT in the tank for bad body pulls. 
---
Also, if you chain your pulls together well, you can stop a lot of them by making sure that the hunter has something else to kill while the new kill target walks over to you, and out of aggro range of his buddies. 
---
Yeah, there are some things that are just not surviviable, like pulling the last boss of an instance along with a bunch of the preceeding trash. But those are incredibly rare, and even on pservers where elite damage is much higher, an extra 2-3 elites tend to be no big deal for a group. Especially if your dps has some CC.
---
Oh my god yes. Thank you
---
Cloaks don't have an armor class since the beta. I'd rather have a tank with properly statted leather than useless mail.
---
Irrelevant
---
Not really because I'll be doing it with friends and not viewing it from a place of fear and dread as if it's the interminable Mountain I must climb before I get to the fun of end game
---
I like tanking so I'm considering going Warrior... however I am put off with how solo unfriendly the class is whereas a Druid is freerer in many respects. Dont wanna be main tank so I'm happy to just do 5 mans etc.
---
I'm having this issue as well. I have a husband that wants to be Horde and 3 friends that want to be Alli. Two friends, I can already guess, will be super unreliable about logging in, and the third will no life the hell out of it (then probably go back to retail). There's no way we can all stay in pace with each other. I might just need to set myself to offline and hide.
---
Eh, whatever. I've yet to met a competent one; not cause of the mageblade (could honestly give a shit about that, I was a pally, we can heal with almost anything, I was just saying yes, there is a reason for pallies to want this, it is good for them).
---
 I was referring to how they always favorite their friends and buddies rather then who contributes more to the guild. I've never seen one NOT do that. I was in a guild in vanilla that was loot council even (actually kind of rare back then), and benefited from the favoritism myself back then. 
---
I just don't like loot councils cause they are a great theory, but never pan out on the real world. Kind of like communism. Sure, sounds great, we all share and work hard and care. And then human nature takes over.
---
Not that dkp is any better mind you. Just not looking forward to loot council bs. I've never seen one work the way they should.
---
[removed]
---
22 for me. God damn kids.
---
Go look at the bis list before you call someone incompetent.
---
I suspect that rabbit hole goes very deep, dark and disturbing. Back away now.
---
I predict pure insanity from multiple teams, it's going to be a fun launch.
---
I almost did, the mid-semester progress reports we got in like March showed I was gonna fail four of my classes. I started high school the fall before Vanilla dropped and since it came out like three weeks before midwinter vacation I still had a 4.0 on my mid-year report card. That progress report was a wake up call for my parents. It also told them how much I’d been skipping school, since they both left for work before the bus came and both came home after I was supposed to. 
---
My dad let me keep playing after I took a month off to catch up on all the assignments I hadn’t done and do my end of year papers and whatnot. I ended up with like a 3.2. More importantly my raid guild was able to clear everything except Naxx, which felt like the bigger accomplishment to 14 year old me.
---
Hey there, just to give an update the BWL items should be fixed. Thank you again for letting us know!
---
Huge is a pretty big word.  It might just be that you won't see BWL fury tanks until AQ when you start getting more agi based tank gear in the conquerer's set.  Which gives big dodge and crit from the agi (which also scales with kings/ZG buff).
---
&gt; Is blizz does their job, and makes it so the world buffs don't stack, then this discussion will be redundant.
---
That's not doing their job.  Buffs stacked in vanilla, buffs will stack in classic.  Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
He's not wrong from a "meta" standpoint. If you assume equal gear and skill, a stronger typical PvP spec from other classes is going to perform better than the rogue.... but when it comes to tearing bad players up? Nah, the rogue is going to still perform way better.... and since most of WoW's players aren't meta chasing tryhards, I can see why you'd think that would be a ridiculous statement, but in proper context.. it really isn't.
---
Just level as a group. You may be able to do more quests and cover more zones. Could be fun!
---
You can put the paladin in the tank group for devo aura and still have the paladin heal the raid. LoH can be used to give the tank armor, but that has nothing to do with who the paladin should be healing.
---
The priests healing armor buff constantly procs on tanks throughout the entire raid, making the whole run a lot smoother. If you don't have a priest healing the MT, you're just wasting a +25% armor buff on him and that's straight up stupid.
---
I'm 21 and started back at the end of vanilla when I was like 8 or 9 or so. Stopped playing in WOD and can't possibly be anymore hyped for classic!
---
Hey there, thank you for the feedback! This tool is for dungeon and raid items, it's not a full item database such as Wowhead.
---
Yeah not everyone is good at raiding and on a pserver thats slowly dieing we can’t pick and choose who we bring to raids. We’re lucky if it fills up at all. So just because it should be that way doesn’t mean it always is. Not every guild is going to fly through mc when it launches. Sometimes you need to gear your healers to be able to clear content.
---
Hey there, we had a few other people let us know about this and we're able to get these updated today.  Looks like some of those slipped through because they were originally MC  drops and it wasn't until patch 1.4 they were removed and then patch  1.6 it was when they were relocated to BWL for example. 
---
Very much appreciate the feedback, it helps us fix errors!
---
I disagree. Why can’t you leave it at that?
---
I'm glad you are realizing this, most people are just thinking "Yeah I'm gonna power through to 60 in 5 days and only sleep for 4 hours a night"... and when they do that and come out the other end at level 52 it's going to be hilarious!
---
Set expectations right and you won't burn out as fast :)
---
My mantra while I level in those slower parts will be - "even if I played 12 hours a day it would still take me 20 real life days to hit 60"
---
*And to anyone who goes "omegalul 200+ hours to hit 60" - K, enjoy playing fortnite season 33!
---
Seriously though 48-60 is why I doubt I'll have many if any alts :)
---
The entire point of having a character you use for the group activity (and only the group activity) is more or less a commitment to your friendship. It's about having a time / hang-out place for your group and no-one else, where you're committed to them (and being there for them/group collective, in spite of your personal circumstances). It's a shared experience that is supposed to be unique to your group and only your group. It's fundamentally the same mindset that (should) exist for 40 man raiding. You're there for everyone whether you personally gain or not, you're not just going to stop showing up once there's nothing immediately tangible to you.
---
***
---
Whether you'll understand the meaning of my words (above) I don't really know. By your own admission (I just can't be arsed) it seems that you value yourself more than the group collective. It's perfectly fine/rational to justify that you'll be together at max level but that misses the point in many ways. I have no idea about your personal circumstances (and the following is cliche in a lot of ways) but would you ever rationalize 'not spending time together/dating' the person who'd go on to be your significant other because once you 'got together you'd be spending much more time with each other in the future?
---
There's a stereotype (and this is warranted in many cases) that people who 'served together' (military) have a greater bond with one another, whatever else may happen down the road, whatever the circumstances are, they look out for one another because of their shared experiences (and the stress of the situations that would have stemmed from that). The ones who go out on patrol side-by-side are inherently going to have a better bond with each other than with a commanding officer who is in relative safety and isn't facing the same trials/suffering. If you agree to level as a core group (and then don't), no matter what benefits may arise from you powering ahead, even if you come back you won't have the same bond.
---
But then you've still got a road leading to redridge, and if you spent 2 weeks in elwynn/westfall.
---
&gt; Yes, in hindsight it's obvious.
---
&gt; you'd be in your high teens and see that there aren't skull 
---
 monsters in redridge.
---
But the fact is that i was in Elywnn for 2 weeks. I spent like 2 days just farming defias at Stone Cairne lake *(look at all those cloth!)*
---
I believe i didn't leave until around level 13.
---

---
It being best in slot for a class doesn't mean that giving the item to that class over one that can utilize it better is a smart decision. Neltharian's tear is bis for a moonkin. Doesn't mean giving it to one is a good idea.
---
Mmhmm 👌🏻
---
I mean, it won't be - you just have to actually interact with people instead :)
---
Holy shit mate! Firstly thank you for the long reply. Tanks really do seem like quite the job! Some of the points you've made I've gotten used to from other MMOs and they are generally true. If the team knows what they're doing you'll pass through content like a breeze, but if a DPS decides to charge ahead of you and pull every mob, it's their fault for dying.
---
I've actually never played WoW, so I'll have quite the challenge ahead! I'll read some Classic guides and maybe even practice some rotations on a private Vanilla server with a lvl60 boost just to start practicing it straight up and get a general idea.
---
Some questions, what is RFC and LOS pulling?
---
We have people in our guild who are 17. They wanna experience the same magic we boast about nostalgically.
---
Hey there, thanks for letting us know, we've updated that item! Please let us know if you see anything else incorrect!
---
I plan on playing an enhance mainly for pvp but also raiding for weapons and gear and the like. My main will have blacksmithing. What kind of pvp weapons/ gear should I be looking for
---
Ah shit, months are hard.
---
Would they have nerfed it in Vanilla if it were being abused the way it is on the pirated servers?  The answer is absolutely yes.  Therefore, blizzard should remove it in classic as well.   Blizzard taking on a different role in classic is a change.  A huge one.  
---
The sad truth of the matter is that the people espousing #nochanges wants blizzard to recreate their shit sit pirated server, and not vanilla wow.
---
No.
---
I've had the opposite, I've always had them and they've always been good. The people on my loot council typically got the least gear because being fair and honest was important to them.
---
RemindMe! 3 Sep 2019
---
Yeah that's what I've been hearing! But I'll take my time leveling, exploring every bit of the map, so it will be fine! I want to make leveling part of the full game and not a chore to get to max level, which I think Vanilla actually managed it quite well!
---
Hey goudviske, yeah the dungeon 1 sets required some consideration. We still think that rogues should have first grab on it, but we went ahead and added druids as well so they can see that it's an option!
---
Insane then. Crazy dps. Back then you could wax players if you knew what you’re doing. Even now on private servers I barely lose duels as a feral lol.
---
    /cast !Bear Form
---
    /cast Enrage
---
I think that should do it.  Otherwise you can have it check what stance you are in [here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Making_a_macro).
---
I’m not disagreeing at all, BS is my second favorite war skill, that prime Bshout after you range pull for that healing aggro 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
---
Makes sense, and probably even more abilities. I was generalizing a bit.
---
Let's go with 78% uptime. (It's lower than that, but let's go with it.) It's still not 100%. You can't rely on that stamina. You have to pretend that you don't have it. That is my point.
---
Now that you agree that we need to take stamina out of the equation: even at 100% uptime, you're comparing 25 agility + 25 strength vs. 690 armor in bear form (assuming no points in Thick Hide) and 7 to resists.
---
25 agility gives 2% dodge and some threat. 690 armor will give 4% or more in passive mitigation.
---
I would take 2% mitigation over 2% dodge every single time. Consistent, passive, predictable damage reduction is more valuable than an equal chance to avoid all damage. But when it's 4% mitigation vs. 2% dodge? It's not even close. Mitigation wins every time.
---
I’m not. My pserver is in a death spiral and we have healers who complain about bringing reagents for buffs. If we don’t bring those healers we can’t raid at all because there’s not enough people on the server anymore. So we are gearing our competent healers to make up for our shitty healers slack. None of this changes the fact that mageblade is bis for pallies.
---
Mate I’m the same as you, and in the same boat.
---
I figured skinning till 40, get your mount, then drop it for herb and go back to the starting zones with your mount to level it up to scratch, then continue that up till 60.
---
Tailoring will still be worthwhile to level as a priest - you’ll be able to use some of the gear you make (some of it will be out dated tho)... but I figure I want it early so I can start working on the mats for Truefaith (some of the mats are on CD).
---
Once Truefaith, drop Tailoring for Alchemy, start farming / selling pots and flasks to the masses

I'm 18 as of yesterday, and I've been playing World of Warcraft since I was tiny. Extremely excited for Classic WoW: this holds a lot of nostalgia for me too. My oldest memories are of WoW and I can't wait to revisit them and make some new ones, too.
---
Rogues, any combo. If you don't, they'll come back the second you've pulled a mob.

You could do that? That's brilliant!

Nice try blizzard

That is way different that I raided (and what most people advise) but if it works - cheers!

I debated for a long time whether I would create a guild ahead of time or start/join one after launch. I eventually realized that starting a guild in advance allows us to find people who fit our philosophy exactly. While it’s possible to “luck” into the right situation on launch, it’s much easier to build the right kind of culture when you’re grabbing people from such a wide pool. Once servers release, the options diminish rapidly.
---
I’m very, very glad I did. We have a tight-knit group already going into launch, and it’s going to make the leveling experience so much more enjoyable and fun. Anyway, that’s just how I see it! Good luck to you on launch!
---
Very nice work! Top 5 best looking tier sets for sure.
---
Saying something has been META since vanilla just shows you don't have a clue about what you're talking about. Classic is gonna play a lot different to what vanilla was and private server players are way closer to what the current META will be than you think you are.

So would we all have to pretend we don't have jobs and/or families and no life it?

PvE wise, I reckon it's fine that Warrior solo is unfriendly until you get lvl60 and better gear, but I think it's worth it because after all the game is to be played together! PvP wise, Warriors do seem a bit weak in open world PvP (not on Battlegrounds if paired with a pocket healer and whatnot).

As someone who was an officer once in a heavy rp guild I can second all of what hubeijames said. Every week was a new ooc player drama and ic drama, all guilds are different but there was so much drama in mine lol. 
---
All ranging from a guy managing to get himself kicked out about 5  times to burning down a stormwind bar and getting into a full out brawl with the local stormwind guard guild for a week.
---
It's tempting to rp in classic but as if I would officer again, it's basically babysitting with no pay.
---
I would rather have BiS than a status symbol.  I got my Atiesh on a private server with my druid.  By the time I got it, the status part really didn't matter to me.  I rather it go to someone who works hard, but I also rather get the corresponding epic items sooner than what it took to get the Atiesh.
---
People came to the realization that dungeons in the classic beta are easier to do than private servers. Then they saw the big "DUNGEON GRIND OF 2019" In the beta when blizzard upped the level cap from 30 to 40... check any streamers vods - they all went to quest right away and since they were 
---
A. Starting at the same time
---
And 
---
B. On a pvp server 
---
- they all decided to just go run Scarlet Monastery from 30 - 40.
---
Things to keep in mind are - they were mostly in level 30 BIS gear and all in a rush to hit 40.
---
I can't see myself or my friends / guildies having a ton of fun sitting in dungeons for 100+ hours at launch.

That's a good hunter weapon.

If I can roll on an rp-pvp server I will, but if I need to go full pvp I probably won't aside from alts on an rp server.

Wow... you could have opened macros while casting, can't belive you wasted time to pull macros down - ARE YOU EVEN TRYING TO HIT 60 FIRST?

---
LOS pulling is when you use your ranged weapon, and then go out of "Line Of Sight", so the enemies have to run to you. It's useful for pulling casters who run away when they're low on health (which will aggro other groups), or if it's a dangerous spot to fight them.

Are you specifically leveling in dungeons?

It won't matter if you are - do you plan on never going enhancement past 40?

rogues - by far the class that seemed to struggle most with teamwork. stop jumping around. stop stealthing ahead 'to scout' (especially after the mobs saw you the last three times).  stop breaking CC because it was an easy backstab crit.  stop saying your nonsense 'worked' because the group managed to survive a near wipe.

Heck, you are a lucky man then. That last one I was referring to I was in, on the pserver, you could always predict what would happen...
---
Oh, a dps one hander dropped we haven't seen before? The GM (a rogue) is gonna take it. Oh, first mageblade? That one mage who only come around half the time but is irl friends with a bunch of officers is gonna get it. Oh, a tier piece? Let's give it to the dude who was just absent for 2 weeks.
---
Honestly I'm surprised looking back that guild made any progress.
---
Once you play the game enough, loot is all, eh who cares, at least to me. In vanilla I kept coming on the MC/bwl runs well past wanting anything  there cause you know, help the team and all. We were onto aq40 by then but had some newer folks who still needed gear and all.
---
You've been VERY fortunate to only have good experiences with loot councils though.
---
Love classic and all, but not looking forward to that kind of stuff.
---
Played classic since 5 years of age on my own pc/account. My dad played too. 19 now and looking forward to doing more than just run around killing bunnies in elwynn and running from level 26 orcs in redridge.
---
It's objectively a poor decision to piss away loot. Now if your guild misappropriates loot to appease people making threats, it's probably not long for this world anyway.
---
Yeah i've had some really snobby experiences happen and people ditching me mid-rp for others lol. It really depends on how much patience/tolerance you have since you can get good experiences too.
---
They're not doing it to be dicks.  That stuff is a waste of space and/or their bags are full.
---
Could you elaborate that for me?
---
The "reflect trinkets" for fire, frost, and shadow damage, Thorium Grenades, Dense Dynamite, Goblin Sapper Charges, and the Force Reactive Disk are all recipes that deal good amounts of AoE damage *that also applies the threat multipliers from things like defensive stance.*
---
These recipes are unique from other professions in that they require the user, at the time of use, to be an engineer. While any leather-wearer in the game can equip the Devilsaur Set, for instance, only engineers can use these items. You have to be engineering 300 to equip the Force Reactive Disk. Therefore, in order to pull AoE threat, you will absolutely have to take engineering as your second profession, and as both MTs and OTs have to hold AoE threat at times, all tanks will take Engineering. In fact, most progression guilds will have everyone in the raid take it.
---
As a tank, you will likely earn your money more from running dungeons than AoE farming, gathering professions, or selling crafted items from other professions to other players. This means that for all the necessary tanking items from other crafting professions (Alchemy, Blacksmithing, LW, etc), you will likely just buy them from the AH, or at least buy the materials from the AH and craft them yourself using something like Alchemy.
---
I would suggest Eng/Ench (very useful for those who farm dungeons), Eng/Alch (if your guild does not have an alchemist already) or Eng/Herb to make extra money and farm consumables for yourself.
---
For more information, Skarm has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGIO_G5me20) dedicated to tanking professions in Classic. Worth a watch if you're interested in a particular setup.

For the investment it adds something trivial like 20 partywide dps assuming you were stacked with 3/4 melee.

I thought enhance wasnt viable until 40. 
---
I could be wrong. You cant dual wield or have a core ability  if i rememb e r
---
yes! thank you! that's the info I was hoping to hear. I started at the very end if vanilla so my expansion was TBC and I was a hunter then and a dw shaman.
---
a lot of them last 2 minutes, which means you'll typically use them 1-3 times in a raid fight. The shorter duration ones are more reactionary totems like grounding/tremor/earthbind and they wouldn't even be that much better if they had longer durations. Not like a grounding totem should not ground something within 2 minutes anyway
---
Yeah, unless you’re all literally unemployed with NO responsibilities and can literally play all day every day trying to level together is a waste of time.  You’re better off just leveling at your own pace and helping your friends out of you’re up for it when they’re online also.  If you guys happen to maintain a similar level, then just look at it as a bonus.  In theory you’ll all be max level eventually and can focus on playing together more then.

---
honestly I think that 30/0/21 is more of the pvp spec. Instant cast spell is far better in a pvp situation than raiding. Typically if your healers are doing their job no one is going to need an instant cast 3k heal for the most part. Even if no druids/shamans in your raid specced into natures grace priests can still save people with bubble. and flash of light/regrowth/flash heal are all quick spells.
---
Just look at alliance, they get by with no nature's grace shamans

Gotcha, in that regard if you are going to be grouping most of the time it won't matter too much if you are ele/enhance, as long as you have into gear you'll be good to heal.
---
Of course at 60 you'll want to go restoration but a mix of agility / int gear as enhancement won't break your ability to level.

If anything just try and not respec a lot :)

The 15 year old wow tanking mantra says "If the tank dies, it's the healer's fault. If the healer dies, it's the tank's fault. If the DPS dies, it's their own damn fault."  
---
Now, obviously, there are exceptions and grey areas. When DPSers fuck up your pull beyond repair, for example, a healer might die without the tank being at fault. Generally speaking though, you just keep that saying in mind and share it with the idiots as much as you need until they learn.
---
I personally find 40 to 50 worse than 50 to 60. There’s a severe lack of quests after level 45 for alliance at least.
---
Yup I'm with you. No skills, no cooldowns, no mount... ugh kill me now. 50-60 is fine just grinding because you actually get to play your class instead of autoattack/autowand bot.

A shaman can run into MC specced 0/0/0. Even without having BWL ect on farm guilds were running MC with half the raid piss drunk while running around playing “who can kamikaze the most people” on baron geddon.

The only thing about specing badly is wait till a higher level to respec and do some research or at least use a spec calculator because the cost goes up every time.

People go to places because theirs something they want. When a dungeon has gear people want they go there, or they skip the dungeon. If a leveling zone has nothing people want then no one will go there and people will lvl in other areas. Lvl 60s fished in STV for lower level ponds because the fish were still useful. Professions made many zones useful to players. Herbs only grew in certain zones and most zones had a different varieties of herbs.
---
In TBC no one went back to Hellfire Peninsula except to raid or do heroics, and even they people only flew to the instance portal and back. Players need reasons to go back to older areas, and Classic proved it worked.
---
Alright, gotcha! I just thought the one point might make me get the jump on other rogues a little easier, as I guess people generall dont take the talent.
---
Plus I thought the 10min CD was just too long, you might get one use out of it in a BG, for example, though I guess it's better spent there than elsewhere.
---
&gt; The lost 2% Spell Hit is worth more than 13 Intellect, 8 Stamina, and 62 Spell Power.
---
At the very most, 1% hit at that gear level is at very absolute highest worth 20 Spellpower. Possibly less depending on other gear and/or (not) having WBuffs.   
---
But I'd cede that 2% spell crit is probably worth more to 5 mages than 33 SP to a mixed group of locks/mages.

Is Deadmines like a leveling dungeon? I was on a private server once exploring Westfall and I came across (what seemed like) a cottage hidden behind a mountain, on the bottom side, and it was a mine entrance, I entered it and right away I reached an area which by jump wouldn't be high enough to continue to explore the mine. I don't know if it was a thing from the private server or whatever, but still I've always wondered what treasures lied inside.

Private server drops always seemed off. Seen so many weapons, NEVER did weapons drop like that for my guild during Vanilla
---
&gt;it might be slow and painful
---
Killing mobs in 2sec is slow and painful now?
---
Elemental only really becomes an option at a minimum of level 38 (new rank lightning bolt) where you can take a majority of the critical talents that make elemental work in the first place (reduced cast speed, crit multiplier, etc.).  At those levels, you start getting into mail gear (level 40) and can build up a reasonable amount of spell power to make your lightning spells start to hit like trucks.
---
Prior to that, its much faster and easier to go enhancement. And yes, you'll still need a healer set prior to going elemental, but post that cutover, your leveling elemental gear will double as your healer set until 60 when you need to start building purpose built gear with mp/5 and +healing to really excel.
---
It can be as a tank, in raiding you're the first to die, if you're doing your job in dungeons, same deal, and plate costs the most to repair, it can get painful if you had a limited playtime like I did, especially with raiding being so time consuming.
---
Olf Fart...

I KNOW RIGHT! I've actually never played WoW but I've always enjoyed the lore and exploring the areas as a free trial rogue (always stealthed so nobody would kill me), and I've been getting hyped for Classic and it's the first time I'm going to buy a subscription and it's going to be awesome and I've started watching videos and it's my first post here in this subreddit and it's really awesome, on the WoW subreddit I only got 3 short replies but here everyone is so helpful and I hope it's like this in game, no matter the faction!

"Legacy set bonuses disabled" might be one of the most pathetic band-aid fixes they ever did. Boo fucking hoo there's a lot of old set bonuses and once every 3 years one might need tweaking, let's just ruin 90% of customization for the first 119 levels and be done with it. Fucking brain-dead. Anyway, cool character :)
---
There was greens from tbc mid60 that was stronger than raid gear from vanilla.
---
Of course not, doesn't mean they aren't a massive pain in the ass that people will wish didn't exist 3 months in.
---
Not sure if you're blind or just trolling. But this rogue with fiery weapon enchant and who's never used SnD, is top 3 dps throughout the entire fight and even hits #1 at one point. So you can only imagine how godawful the other rogues were from this world class guild.
---
I think tanking is the most fun thing. It's very engaging to have to keep control of all of the mobs, prioritize them if your dps are all attacking different things, stance dance, etc.
---
It might take you a couple of runs through a given dungeon to learn all of the pulls, maybe. But you can usually carry bad groups through then. So you won't have the frustration of a bad tank.
---
One thing to watch out for is: you have to keep your 1H weapon skill leveled up while you're out questing. If you've been questing for a few levels with your 2H and then go into a dungeon to tank and your 1H skill is 25 points short, that's going to be a bad time.
---
I don’t think you know what clap cheeks means, if you’re using it in this context. If you do, that’s just nasty.
---
go back to retail
---
I mean the concept is pretty logical, you break LoS so that they stop casting if they're ranged and start running towards you to re-cast.  
---
You can remove HoTs at your will, what? Do you right click the buff icon or something? (if it's not a macro).
---
no there's really no need to bind strafe if you don't mind using rightclick to strafe. As long as you are strafing instead of keyboard turning we're all good.
---
Yeah, I was on a pretty top end progression guild (our notable was top 10 world C'Thun kill, top 5 US) and a lot of this Pserver strats really make me thing "why didn't we think of this back then".
---
But I remember people from our guild went to the WSVG in Louisville and they had WoW tournament stuff set up.  There was the Baron 40 minute Strath clear as a contest.  Fastest to clear won.  Back then, 40 minute strath was some whole "it's so hard for people in blues to complete it" and most of the time our guild on live servers would get paid by people to run the instance with them.
---
We were starting to do some practice, we were in AQ gear at the time and clearing C'thun at the time, or at least deep in AQ.  So we started removing gear, running half naked thinking that blue gear was just trash.  We never actually did a 40 minute run on live servers and we were thinking we'd fail at WSVG.  Then, they basically had pre-raid BiS available and we cleared in something like 34 minutes to win the contest and it was so much easier than we thought.  
---
Basically, I feel that's the same way that people thing early WoW content is still going to be difficult.  They're probably thinking back when all the gear was shit, like spirit still on epic items.  Now, more so with all the 1.12 changes, it's a joke.
---
the gear drops in naxxramas, the final raid of vanilla.  
---
when you loot a piece there, you take it to a NPC and you have to give them a few crafting mats too in order for them to make the gear usable for you.
---
I don't like things that are chance, so I don't like Initiative, just like I don't like Imp Sap.  I keep really swapping around ideas on how I want to build.  I had never really considered a CB build, but I'm leaning that way now, and will likely skip out on Improved Ambush entirely.  Possibly [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205300105401-3-552250100032101).
---
What I really wanted to do was play a Setup build, but I think I'll probably end up skipping that entirely, and not bother with the Combat tree at all, except Imp Gouge.  But I'll probably change my mind another hundred times.
---
We did the same shit multi-stacking world buffs in vanilla.  So I don't know where you think it wasn't happening on vanilla in retail.
---
I've played some MMOs where tanks basically don't exist (BDO) or they're really plain and boring (Neverwinter), so I have a bit of a prejudice on them, even though I've always liked being the bulky guy that can tank every mob, so I guess I'll definitely give it a try in Classic, the OG of MMOs.  
---
How do you level up weapon skill, simply buy attacking or you go train it with gold on your class trainer?

It's not the Azuresong Palablade.
---
it's not hard, you just go around a corner or something so they can't see you to shoot, so they chase after you.
---
You have to do it for ranged attacking monsters, or they'll just stand there shooting you instead of walking over to attack you after you shoot them.
---
Sometimes you can just charge in, but often the group of monsters is sort of dangerously close to other groups of monsters, and you don't want to get too close to a second group or they might join in. So in that case you shoot them and back up out of range or run around a corner or something, so they come closer to you (further from the second group). Then you can go in and get them.
---
Awesome! It makes you look like a DK. Still a long way to go though.

How do those "raid gear tiers" work? I know dreadnaught is tier 3, and you have 0.5 supposedly. Are they like BiS must-equip-on-every-item-of-the-set or not?

Do you not see the obvious problem with lvl 60 items that have an active bonus that makes them better than lvl 70 or lvl 80 items? It literally ruins the entire item progression system when players keep using a 3 year old item because of the bonus.
---
Kinda uncertain if you're trolling?
---
Burgers guy is going to be real disappointed when all the content is going to be more trivial than they make it out to be.
---
No one tanks as a shaman. Memer tank as a shaman. If you want to be a tank, play tank class.
---
I know what I'm about, son.
---
I'm going through these thoughts too. Only thing different is I'm hard set on rolling priest. I love enchanting. And I wants it. Wand spec + early wand makes me giddy. Sooo, for me tailoring is supplemental. Usually simple - reagent procuring items to disenchant. Not wasting time on bs recipes and spells. Basically just want to make bags and mats for enchanting, and without the extra nonsense I should be able to break even, I'd say, with both profs. Be frugal with your gold. That's my advice.
---
Fast 1h with Flametongue + shield as Enhancement spec is the best way to level pre-40.  Flurry procs off crits, which procs flametongue more. You crush 2h enhance any day up to about level 40
---
Not as bad as the 30-40 grind in my opinion. 
---
Maybe im different but I love the "chicken" trio zones. Feralas, Tanaris, and Hinterlands. Un'goro is dope. Winterspring, searing gorge, and WPL are all great. 58-60 is when I start to feel dry on the quests and I can agree getting to the end is a bit unfun.
---
30-40 is quite a bit of running without a mount. Its like the game decided it needed to up the running juuust before you get your mount to make it that much more satisfying. Plus I dislike all the 30-40 zones. 
---
STV is not a fun zone, you come back to it multiple times, and its a trek to traverse. The pvp is fun but its a mediocre questing zone. Dustwallow is ass, Arathi is extremely boring to me, and Desolace oddly enough is my favorite zone of the bunch. I feel like its a big giant circle of quests/mob grinding and you're done with it so I don't mind it after like 2 levels.
---
37? I felt like 43 was yesterday
---
Yeah. And 0.5 won't be in the game either. That's added much later. With AQ I think, so phase 5.
---
&gt; ) Expand without raising the level cap. Changing the talent system to give people more talents without giving them 10 more levels, and continuing on with the scaling of gear from the previous raid/nonraid content, would preserve the relevance of progression through older content. The hard part then becomes "why do any of the new non-raid content?" Which can also be solved.
---
It just doesn't work. Look at retail on its 40 total raids. If they were all lvl 60 then either most of them would be obsolete and skippable or a lot of them would be skippable with the lvl 60 people in latest raid gear being ridiculously powerful and we wouldn't have any new players since no-one is going to run 40 raids to gear up to current content.
---
If most people will pay 40s, then enough people will pay 1g.
---
You made me remember something I watched in a youtube video. It was someone who played Warrior that was saying that in 40 mans off tanks should have some points spec'ed into Prot because if the MT died they were supposed to pop of Last Stand and tank for the duration, but those points in Prot would hurt their dps quite a bit, so his trick was to pretend to be bad and "not find where Last Stand was" or missing the button to miss the stance, everything to not put points in Prot :D
---
I hit 20 2 months ago if that counts. I started in TBC so to me this is my chance to experience what I missed
---
The repairs aren't that bad. I never ran into a situation where i couldn't afford to repair my shit, I don't think. 
---
Warriors get screwed a little because plate armor is more expensive to repair than everything else. But even a really hefty repair bill after a terrible dungeon run where you died a few times is like maybe 5g. You can probably farm 30g/hour or something like that, depending on your methods (could be much higher if you're doing something fancy). So it's not a big deal.
---
Farming 100g per week to respec twice (e.g. to be the raid tank and pvp at the same time) would be more of a chore (maybe 3-4 hours of additional farming per week).
---
Maybe I am just sick, but I actually find grinding mobs to be sort of meditative (I think it's all the smooth blizzard animations and the combat sounds -- they really did a great job with all of the blood spurting noises and stuff in the game, I don't know), so that doesn't sound too bad to me.
---
Love the macros with this newer engine. Easy mode compared to the old scripts.
---

14 years of blizzard never inviting me to betas has been totally redeemed!!!

So get this, i work from home, my kids are all adults (on paper, not in practice... another story there) and my wife works evenings.  Funny thing is that with all this time to play... i usually end up spending my free moments studying to be better at my job, even when work is slow i study.  Whats even funnier is that when im working/studying, i keep thinking, "man, the house is gonna be empty, imma farm/grind/level/pug/wowowowowieieieieowowowow it up only to end up going back and doing work or studying.  Sigh, i used to be cool, lol.

Roll on whatever you want, if they don't like it they can find another group. Or if you're not the majority they can find another tank.

I’ve just recently been practicing doing this, except I just took a and d and used them for other keybinds and use q and e to strafe, the only reason you would need to do what you’re saying is so you don’t have to keep the right click down to strafe, which will really only matter in pvp because it’s nice as a caster or any class to be able to strafe with the keys and use the mouse to quickly target something else or turn your camera for a better angle without having to turn that way. Otherwise, I held the right button and used a and d to strafe for years and never had any issue with it but I also played melee mainly.
---
If my wife works a night shift, it's WoW for as long as I want, with anything I feel like for dinner
---
Phasing....... :,(
---
Same but my wife gets livid when I try to creep into the bedroom at like 1 or 2am. Shes a light sleeper. 
---
Cant win.
---
Meditative? Or masochist :D  
---
Speaking about respec'ing and PvP, how are Warriors in terms of open world PvP and Battlegrounds? I know they are gods in PvE, but I never hear them about PvP!
---
Haha, thought the same thing!
---
Plus, they're balanced for you to pull one group at a time. If somebody accidentally pulls a second group while you're fighting the first, it's likely that you'll wipe. (Depending on if you outlevel/outgear the dungeon or have a really good team, you might be able to take two groups reliably. But if you're doing it at the appropriate level with pick-ups, it's very likely to be a wipe.)
---
18 Here. My entire family was big into wow when I was growing up but they dropped it around MoP. My Brothers tried desperately to get me into wow for a long time but I just didn't really like the retail game until eventually my older brother suggested a vanilla wow private server.
---
For pvp I can see it, but never heard of any success. Would but interested in seeing actual data on this. The main thing of the default ele is 5crit in the resto tree though. Not ns
---
Headmaster's Charge is extremely overrated and not worth farming. If you get it as a drop it's good though!
---
You are going alliance and that’s final!

ataris  - the boys of summer
---
Yeah you can right click on any of your buffs to remove them. Any time a priest shields me pre-pull I'll remove it and tell them to knock it off.
---
Oooooh.  Probably too soon for Calgary, still.
---
I really don't agree, but we'll find out won't we, soon!
---
Potentially, but that will assume no "spoiler guilds" or pug groups screwing it up.  
---
For Nef it probably will be coordinated.  Maybe Ony too at first.  But ZG, and Rend head, and Ony in phase 2/3 when it's pugged will be too hard to control.
---
Action mf Bronson!
---
I think people used to go 31/5/15 back in the day as a sort of hybrid pvp/tanking spec (getting Mortal Strike out of arms, +5 crit out of fury, and extra threat out of prot. Maybe you could drop a couple of points out of defiance to get last stand if you wanted to). But I don't know if they still do that or not.
---
All warriors have Shield Wall as a tanking oh-shit button; maybe you could use that and not need last stand. It's on a 30 minute cooldown, I think. But hopefully your tank is not dying that frequently. :)
---
70% of survey respondents say they're former private server players. Not only is the social infrastructure of the games the same, but the players are the same.
---
Sofas.
---
I remember having that phone. I traded it to my girlfriend for 3 “blow me now” cards i could cash in at any time and her shitty phone.
---
Worth it.
---
So true about the people skipping raids for a phase. However I guess if they don't raid they will stay low on this list for when the new phase comes out.
---
Yeah. You have to pick the right time. But if you're tanking in your dps gear because the tank just died, and maybe the healers will take a second to realize who picked up the boss, that's definitely the right time.
---
Tons of abilities, yes. I think it adds a lot of richness to the game. I am always running out of keys to bind shit to, though.
---
I have no fucking idea what song is that, but I laughed nonetheless.
---
Nope! Between quests, you'll find me farming cloth and enjoying every kill. Even at level 18 Warlock can spice up just killing things really easy, let alone at 48+
---
Personally, I'm 19 and I'm extremely hyped for Classic. I've been on the Vanilla-track for a pretty long time now, playing private servers and stuff like that.
---
 I've been sitting on my dad's lap when he played Classic back then and I had to look away whenever he entered combat. The fact that this didn't bothered me at all is probably evidence enough how fun this game seemed to me and I literally counted DAYS until I would turn 12 finally to get my own account.
---
At some point, I finally was allowed to be Dad's personal fishing slave, making him rich with stonescale eels while not even knowing. Whenever he was gone for a minute I used to beat the shit out (or not) out of nearby mobs with my (actually Dad's) beloved fishing rod, because I didn't know how to switch weapons although I watched him playing for HOURS and HOURS. Was too busy falling in love with the surroundings of the game.
---
My favorite zone was Durotar and I have no idea why. Probably because my Dad rolled an Undead warrior and I never got to see everything in Durotar, because obviously, he didn't quest there.
---
Personally, I started playing WoW in Cata and because of that, I am one of the few people who had a shit ton of fun playing this game back then and I still have very fond memories of this time. My interest in retail stopped with Legion, I think. Still I played WoW, because... well, it's WoW. It was at the time of early Legion when I started playing on private Vanilla servers as well and... yea, I REALLY want Classic to finally launch.
---
So you could say I was born and raised for Classic. Although that was never part of dad's plan or anything. He didn't let me watch for too long, mostly an hour at once. He's a great dad and I'm glad I've got to love this game early on.
---
Fun fact #1: My Dad's warrior professions were skinning and leatherworking because those we're the only trainers he could find in Tirisfal and he didn't know about asking guards or Undercity in general.
---
Fun fact #2: My favorite weapon back then was the warriors Whirlwind Axe. I cried when he sold it because it was outdated at that point.
---
I WAS A KID WHICH LOVED WOW OKAY
---
Fun fact #3: He still owns his warrior up to this day (nothing special, I know, BUT:) with the exact same professions. He stuck to it. I always liked that, somehow.
---
So yea. Me and my Dad went through a whole lot in Azeroth etc. We're probably gonna start a little "Padawan vs. Master" thingy, of course I wanna show him I'm a serious rival. *smiles* We both stopped playing Retail entirely at BfA, so we're really excited for the launch.

on classic beta about 2 weeks ago.  leveled to max on 2 characters.  first was no pools second was going after only pools within sight of where i was fishing.    5ish hours was with the occasional pools in Alterac and feralas.   6ish hours was just standing in place.

Yes, call totem twisting and it is a pain in the ass
---
💯💯
---
&gt;How is it not objectively bad?
---
Because there is the possibility that others may like it.
---
You and I both dislike the mechanic, but that's our subjective opinions.
---
well, not really. If you wipe it just means that everybody has to run their ghost back from the graveyard to the dungeon, where you spawn back at the entrance. Usually you can walk back through the part you already cleared and pick up where you left off.
---
If you've been in there for so long that the monsters you cleared have started to respawn, then that's bad. Probably people would give up at that point. But you can always go back to that dungeon again later -- it doesn't really matter.
---
Cata Heroics pre-nerf still go down as some of the most fun I've had in this game 😥. Difficult enough to feel accomplishment from clearing them daily, not so difficult that they were impossible to PuG. Humans are the reason we can't have nice things....
---
Interesting.
---
Sucks
---
I actually like the WoD models. I get wanting them to be like you remember but I think of all the shit changes this one I don’t mind the models tbh
---
That's not funny at all.. you should stop spending your time productively and waste it on MMOs like all the rest of us!
---
camping lowbies is more "nerd lord shitty" than raiding tho
---
We’ve got a guild for you on NA just like that. 😉
---
Just a HUGE guild full of funny people who just want to enjoy the game.
---
Aside from the initial 15$ sub. You can easily farm the gold from scratch to pay for a sub. If you play consistently, you can easily make a couple million gold. And never worry about a sub again.
---
We're in for a fun time then :D
---
Also, just because someone makes a counter-claim, that does not imply circular logic.
---
For my own guild I won't start advertising until the realm list appears, but I ain't worried until the guild is formed in game. Finding officers is by far my largest concern, none of my friends will be going hardcore so I have to find new people for my officer slots, and my raid leader. Not much I can do for that but hope
---
I’m also leveling with a group of friends but we just do our own thing and help each other when requested with hard (group) quests/dungeons and PvP related issues. We all agreed this is the best and only option. It’s almost impossible even with one friend let alone 4.
---
But there is need of tolerance and a healthy balance of give and take.
---
Was this on Laughing Skull?
---
Yeah you just need to pay for the plane ticket
---
Easily make a couple million gold... as someone who's been trying for years, mind telling us how?
---
MAGEblade
---
70% of the people here.  Definitely not 70% of the people who are going to play Classic.
---
You forgot https://youtu.be/QKNgN5C4kqE
---
This will be my go to, especially the first few days
---
I laughed
---
Yeah I've heard Engineering is the best profression.
---
Warriors when they get in melee range do seem very strong. The problem, as you said, is getting kited. And also, you won't have a pocket healer with you everytime.
---
Here is my dilemma, I either roll a Rogue which is arguably better at PvP but can't tank or roll a Warrior who can tank but is arguably worse in PvP. The problem is, I will have much fun with both, which makes it hard to decide.
---
Meh, I have wasted more time than that on equally fruitless stuff. It's part of just being in a world big enough for you to not know everything already. 
---
Also, it's not supposed to be so obvious that you would feel foolish for missing it. There's a whole lead in quest chain about talking to the head of stormwind intelligence, then finding and killing a messenger, then finding a traitor and having to protect him while he shows you where the entrance is. It's one of the more hidden dungeons in the game.
---
As an old bachelor, I can do this every night. I ain't mad.

Slaughtered enough of them to get the pirates hat on my mage back in the day. Still catches me with my pants down when I do my sporadic resubs and take a flight path to Booty Bay... damn can they hold a grudge.
---
How those snot faced leper stumps were allowed into the Horde is beyond me.
---
Use world enlarger and vanish from existence
---
&gt;Then nothing is ever objectively bad
---
Correct! .... unless you are using an objective scale to measure something. There is a threshold of 190 LDL cholesterol level that doctors call "bad". When it comes to video game mechanics, however, I don't know of any such objective scale.
---
First time ever hearing the opinion, but it checks out.
---
As someone that is unsure about how hardcore I'll be playing classic for past the first month - this sounds like great fun!
---
In vanilla my first 60 was a rogue but I was too young to really get into wow, by the time BC rolled around I had played a 60 Oakland and ended vanilla with a 60 lock.
---
This time around I've planned on rolling mage but there is this small feeling that I'll just say screw it on August 26th and roll my first character ever, 60 female NE rogue. 
---
Good luck to you and have fun!
---
Back during Vanilla, I had to move out of my place in a rush, and the only place I could find and afford at the time was a room in this old guys place in a trailer in the middle of nowhere. At the same time, a traffic ticket I got that was dismissed was filed with an incorrect law code, and caused my license to be suspended (long story short, took a full year to modify the ticket so I could drive again). What ended up happening was I basically was stranded each night and for full weekends. Had to get anything I needed ahead of time because the walk was insane. So I played WoW, the whole time. It was pretty great. Made that year a lot faster.
---
Why does everyone seem to forget this?
---
True, on a few items, but almost all epic items for casters in general is not specified to a school of magic including class sets. Im not opposing its great for paladins though, only the point where you mention the healing as a point, since all non specific spelldamage items is defined that way.
---
I was already in my Sr. Year :P
---
Definitely seems rewarding, and you're like the leader of the group. Yup, leveling seems hard, but I think I'm willing to take the risk.
---
Shadow Priests stood out in PVP as just completely wrecking my Paladin, however that's kind of like scissors saying rock stood out.
---
Haven't they been shunned enough? Their capitol is infested by level 30 sick/dying creatures and IF still hasn't asked the level 55 guards patrolling the area to check it out?
---
If everyone always needs everything there are no ninjas unless they use ml.  And anyone who uses ml in 5 mans should be kneecaps 🙃
---
Yep. Gotta kill them first, in self defense.
---
They wouldn’t buy gold they know better.
---
I'd assume it would go something like this:
---
After someone reports it a gm will probably despawn your infernal. If you keep summoning them he'll talk to you about it. If you then still keep summoning them you'll get a timeout.
---
If the entire reason you do something is to grief others then blizzard wont ignore it.
---
Most pvp happens in battlegrounds? I had no idea. That changes my view of things, I heard Warrior is insane in Battlegrounds because you'll most likely have healers.
---
I personally also think warrior ends up feeling more fun, but you always have that urge to create rogue and go headhunting and gank people from the other faction (especially on PvP realms). It's like the devil on your shoulder equivalent.
---
Actually that's also a good topic. What are you gonna roll, a PvE or a PvP server? I still haven't decided. PvP seems more immersive but PvE more practical.
---
Shit, ima 9
---
Elitism isn't necessary toxic but it's always off-putting
---
Human in BC was more meaningful because it was a small arena and you should always get the opener. Wrath humans became The pvp race. I’d say human offers a nice mix of pvp/pve racials in vanilla. Gnome and dwarf offer a nice pvp alternative with specific use. I was very happy with my dwarf rog tbh. Stoneform creating those clean vanishes and negating blind can be extremely strong.
---
Mage.  
---
I had an alt alliance hunter on Sylvanas EU back in the day and there was this fucking undead mage named Vurtne that just wrecked ass in Tyr's Hand, the shit he did made me respect good mages a TON.
---
You misspelled warlock
---
Playing Alli?
---
I agree, it’s layered that way.  The art doesn’t really wow me. It’s just barren of depth.
---
No, then everyone who wasn't going to equip it is a ninja looter
---
Tender hoof : inexperienced (reminds me of tenderfoot rank in scouts)
---
Short fang. : Old, weathered
---
Softpaw - same thing as tender hoof?
---
Oh man migoreng and wow. Thats a nostalgia hit right there. I think I'm going to stock up for classic launch
---
Basically fighting rogues as a dwarf you should always win. Yes perception is nice but you have to know the stealther is already there. Negating a blind reset is massive. I honestly think dwarf is just great for most classes.
---
Odd that death and taxes didn't....  Most guilds didn't stack buffs.

Not sure yet. Dickish still regardless of faction.

---
why did u call urself powerchordA5 if u dont know what A5 is
---
 It's not illegal, it's frowned upon. Like masturbating on an airplane. In all seriousness though. Dick move sure, but it's within the bounds of the game.
---
That's only the case if the group is slow enough for the mobs to start respawning. A single wipe won't cause this to happen.
---
No I'll duel you on MY Warlock
---
&gt; People were running this shit on 56k modems and barely trying.
---
rofl, really now...  Coming from the kid that couldn't get pas MC.
---
&gt; And people are going to be really surprised when molten core and bwl feel like a really large crowded legion normal dungeon
---
It's a completely different game, so I won't be surprised at all.
---
Yea I'm doing skinning and leatherworking on my druid til 60 but I have to swap to enchanting for my tank trinket and then I'll probably keep that for DE while I level my paladin, hunter, and warlock which are all gonna run skinning and LW at first. I just want the spreadsheet versions of the guides that I saw before lol
---
Spanish inquisition.
---
Well my characters back story is that he was a pirate but got sick of the life on the sea and retired to being a ninja
---
I remember doing this with mining nodes as a wee lad. 
---
I'm ashamed :c
---
lol I used to do this in DAoC. I would camp a low level near the centaur, run in when he was about to die and snatch it up. When I quit I randomly gave one of my Cloudsongs to some level 3 noob who had no idea what it was
---
Nooo bro that's the best time imo , 1-20 is the grind
---
I don't really care about ninja looting unless they legitimate don't need it. Like a rogue stealing plate legs. 
---
If it's like "X item is reserved for Y but Z yoinks it" you gotta do what u gotta do
---
I was a core raider in a loot council guild. I was not apart of the loot council.  My gear always came after the guy that was in the loot council even though I had equal dps and better raid attendance.   
---
I still think loot council is the best system.   Dkp just opens the door for too much drama.
---
I raided because I enjoyed it.  The gear came pretty quickly with 100% raid attendance for 15 months.
---
&lt;3 he has so many great druid guides and videos
---
I like orc rogues, because then you are a direct counter to other rogues.
---
Shaman just feels so satisfying to play, if you like support. Totems are insane, a well timed Tremor is Good Stuff.
---
Also Windfury crits are quite fun, if inconsistent
---
I’m a dad with a baby and toddler and would love to be in a guild like this. What faction and zone will you be playing in?
---
Very true. Compare it to retail where every zone is like an over the top themed amusement park....
---
Spell pushback works as follows:
---
* First hit: 1.0 sec  
---
* Second Hit: 0.8 sec  
---
* Third Hit: 0.6 sec  
---
* Fourth Hit: 0.4 sec  
---
* Fifth Hit (and all subsequent hits): 0.2 sec
---
I never said it wasnt good for other casters either. Just that it shouldnt be a sin for a pally to roll on it.
---
It feels like it was only yesterday it was 38 days away
---
One of the reasons the Bronzebeard dwarves never fell to Horde sieges is because they didn't have a second exit on the other side.
---
Ironforge is known for its architectual integrity and fortification .
---
It's inconvenient, but necessary.
---
This is rad. How much are your commissions?
---
Classic will be easier then vanilla because all the informations already available and all the players are already trained due to decades of going through dungeons with actual mechanics. 
---
I’m saying vanilla wow was easy. Classic is only going to be easier then an already extremely easy game. The greatest challenges to vanilla wow were related to quality of life issues of the game itself. Not mechanics of the bosses and dungeons. I’m not sure you’re capable of even reading because I’ve said nothing of my individual skill.
---
I levelled up many characters in Vanilla and have since done it again on those other servers. 
---
I don't know what I do differently, but I usually hit 60 with zones spare. Last time I levelled was a Druid and never even went to Silithus and dinged 60 (just over 5 days /played) in the first part of Winterspring. Didn't finish EPL either.
---
Maybe because I do some dungeons while levelling? I always make sure to do quest runs of Deadmines / WC, BFD, RFK, SM, RFD, ZF, ST.
---
Dungeons are usually good for a 'free' level as long as you have the quests.
---
Horde or dirty Alliance?
---
Tailoring is a good option.  I wouldn't even bother with a 2nd.
---
What if iys an item a buddy has been tryin for for months, hes not there that day though. So you swipe it, an rub it in his face when he gets on.

Is that ok?

yes they are - i was just trying to make an example.  that was one class that really stood out to me in Cata.  Reason for my post was to ask vanilla players what stood out to them.
---
After the stress test I was thinking about the math for the zone. Per a WoW dev on his stream, the orginal game (all of Azeroth) was only supposed to support 1000 players per REALM. In the stress test it felt that around 200 people or more where in the starting zone and layer I was in. This is why it was so hard to quest. This was from people who were already subscribed to WoW and wanted to participate in the test. I know a lot of people who are going to play Classic IRL who did not participate in any stress test. If this is true for a lot of other players, than launch day numbers will be huge because of the amount of people returning to the game.
---
Paladins because they like to have a hero complex. 
---
Other rogues to establish dominance.
---
I love these kind of stories. 
---
I have fond memories of helping the opposing faction finish their chicken escort quests. I can just imagine them about to freak out and then being pleasantly surprised by the turn of events.
---
Its best that the main tank is the guild master.
---
It just fixes so many problems that way
---
As someone who actually played an arms warrior... yes and no.  Leveling and gearing is grueling but the pay off at max level with  -good- gear makes you a PVP god and you still pull decent raid DPS... unless you can hit cap fury for raid DPS.
---
Ooohhh yeah, added. Thanks
---
;) good times to be had for sure. Have a good one, friend. Hope to see you in Classic for the Horde!
---
can you explain hit cap fury for raid dps?
---
I enjoy that, little bit between pulls etc. Retail, pull the whole fucking instance in 30 seconds. No clue wtf is even going on half the time lol
---
I picked BFA up a few weeks ago and it is exaclty as I thought. A single player daily collection quest deal.  Collect this pearl, colelct that azerite, collect junk
---
I just turned 17 and I’m super excited!!
---
5 hours in BRD? YES PLEASE.
---
Hey mage here this gives me so much anxiety reading this.... it says mage in the name.....
---
Yeh, taking time to mark targets and get it right or else you fucking die.
---
I like this list. Very helpful!
---
I like my coffee black just like my metal
---
100%
---
For real. Full BRD run will take you ages and when you come out you have friends. You learn to work together, and you come out the other side stronger in numbers and gear.
---
Hell maybe bullshit with the group for a few while waiting, little bit of social time.
---
It was 2004-2005 when I was leveling so I have no idea but i do recall using my own crafted gear all the way up until I started picking up wildheart gear.
---
Check prices for ore and herbs  [https://theunderminejournal.com](https://theunderminejournal.com/)  , pick the most "expensive" realm, and you can do 100k gold for 4h farm session easily.
---
Oh, you don’t form a group quickly. You’re chatting it up a good 45 minutes while you whisper every warrior on the server begging them to go.
---
I would say that is encouraged.
---
Sounds like a legitimate Stormwind random vendor

---
I played in an RPPVP server through all of wrath and most of cata, before I quit (until recently). None of what you guys are saying ever happened.. it was just a regular server that happened to have the option for RP and a solid base of people doing so. I know my experience is just anecdotal evidence, but it couldn't have been *that* different in every single other RP server.
---
Would ele be a better choice than boomy for wpvp? As a retail balance player I’m pretty discouraged seeing what people say about classic in regards to actually getting geared out on a Druid.
---
+1 respect for loyalty!
---
Every time I missed an MC run I swear my guild had to de some cenarion pieces that would have been mine. Anytime I was there no loot for me.
---
Yeah the private server record is under 10 days but remember that Classic MC will be significantly easier so a 7 day MC is definitely possible.
---
I can
---
Well so far all the evidence points out that spamming dungeons from 20 to 60 is way faster than Joana's 4 day 20 hour record.
---
because of the ability to trade items from inside a raid within 2 hours, i expect to see a bunch of staged ones.
---
It won't be that much easier, if at all.  That isn't even really relevant though.  The hard part is getting enough people high enough level, with enough gear, and enough reputation to summon rag.
---
Hey! I'd love to read or watch more about this. Do you have a link or sources? Thanks!
---
Yeah I was a druid with leatherworking and skinning and I has an epic mount when I hit 60 from selling helms of fire and ungoro is where I farmed most of the mats.  The quests are good and the zone is easy to navigate it's just a great zone.
---
This is definitely feelz
---
My experience with MMOs starts with LOTRO, so that's where I developed this tendency. The human starting zone is full of nice boring fields, lakes, a little bit of swamp, and forest. The hobbit starting zone is *The Shire*, as in, the definition of a peaceful countryside. It's a little different for dwarves and elves, but nothing too crazy.
---
Then I played some Rift, and that game's starting zone is all YOU'RE IN A FUCKING WAR ZONE AND WE'RE ABOUT TO LOSE AND WE NEED TO SEND YOU BACK IN TIME HURRY RUN GO GO GO
---
I've played classic, just because its not the easymode that retail has become doesn't mean you have to nolife to have fun.
---
I would give anything for that feeling from vanilla to pretty much cata of minimal/no responsibilities and the desire and ability to play so much wow. I don’t have nearly as much time, taking the week off classic, but it’s just a shame what retail has become.
---
That was an emotional roller-coaster
---
wtf is sr?
---
If gnomes can be warriors then tauren should be able to be rogues
---
os+1?
---
Red=dead and I've never found a flaw with this equation.
---
Yeah I added that dungeon leveling is extremely fast in the Beta, apparently it's faster than Joana's 4 day 20 hour time. Gear and rep is not an issue, that's like 6-8 hours of work.
---
I’m not saying that. anything outside of soloing is going to take time. That’s just a fact. You might get lucky and be the last person they need for a group and able to start right away but you still have to travel, and the time to complete will be long.
---
I remember I was in gadgetzan on my UD priest and ran past a NE warrior. He was wearing Big Bad Pauldrons and some other leveling gear. I emoted for him to wait three times and ran to the bank. He waited but seemed a little confused.  
---
At the bank I grabbed my Orb of Deception and made my way back to the warrior. I stood in front of him and used it, which changed my appearance to a male NE with the same shoulders as him. We looked like cross faction twins. 
---
We danced and laughed for a half a minute and then he emoted for me to wait. He also ran to the bank, came back and drank a noggenfogger, turning him into a skeleton. After more dancing and laughing we waved goodbye and went our separate ways. 
---
It was the type of fun interaction that doesn’t happen anymore.  But just maybe in late August....
---
BAD END
---
BFA launch was the last time I did this, I did a 24 hour marathon (ended up going like 25ish), had my wife in on it, so she brought me drinks, and dinner that night. She is the actual best!
---
The post I saw suggested it would take 5-6 days played to get to 60 that way.
---
Right. It does. No problems with that. Not saying it isn’t part of the game that happens I’m just saying that it’s a pathetic and dickish goal to gank lowbies incapabale of defending themselves. Again, downvotes welcome, cuz I’ll stand on this hill all day long.
---
Guy who world buffs for every raid agrees with world buffing. Shocker.
---
Preach
---
“I have an alt”
---
&gt;Raidlead decides based on performance and attendance raid, as well as need for the progression itself.
---
that just encourages people to cheat and stack world buffs
---
You think 60 dungeons are gonna be harder? I have a feeling they won’t. I can’t even imagine a 2 hour UBRS.

no "guild bank" in vanilla.
---
For leveling I feel like 5/5 Aspect of the Hawk is really great. 
---
It helps you burn down elites / hard mobs &amp; improves your dungeon dps.
---
Ignoring both of those, it feels really great when it procs? I felt like a god when my 3.2 gun was blasting bullets out. Personal preference probably, but I did enjoy it a lot.
---
Is that a statement or are you being sarcastic? Cant tell honestly
---
I main an Outlaw Rogue on retail. In general you're not going to like any class much or get a real feel for it before level 110.
---
Best advice I can give you is never fall into the Slice and Dice trap. Learn to love Roll the Bones. I used to hate it but I really like it now, except for the garbage RNG on it but every class and aspect of the game has it. That's the biggest difference, you have to wait for the game to let you be at your best instead of trying to get there. It's definitely for the casual player unless you get into Mythic Raiding or very competitive PvP.
---
If you have any questions about Outlaw, feel free to ask.
---
Bah! For real! Like: “Hey man, sometimes Mike Tyson just punches a 7th grader’s teeth through the back of his skull. Deal bruh”
---
If whatever guild I end up in ends up doing a LC I'll do my part to make everyone feel good with regular loot upgrades!
---
I just hope folks who find themselves in a LC situation have people who care up there in the council.
---
Frost mage is arguably the best PvP class in the game at every gear level. The amount of control you have over the average PvP encounter is unmatched. You bring an obscene amount of passive and active CC to the table. Melee classes can't touch you, and other casters can't force you to commit to a fight that isn't going your way. You almost always have the option of running away, assuming you've already reached into your large bag of tricks and come up empty, which generally isn't going to happen unless you get jumped at half health or you're outnumbered. Even then, you can pull out miracles that no class other than hunter or SL warlock could hope to match.
---
Imp Healing Wave is massive and as its only a T1 its a great investment if you plan on healing a bit. 
---
At least into the 50s healing will be more than fine  (still viable then).
---
Ele/resto is good also. You drink too much leveling but if you take the time to beg/buy mage water its not that bad. 
---
I would totally go Enh , but consider 5/5 in imp healing wave if you plan on healing a lot.
---
Not having a gathering prof is just leaving money on the table
---
From my own personal experience yes. The thing is geared raiders won’t be doing them, unless it’s a guild run to gear up a new recruit or a paid run people pay them to tank. It’s all about the gear and if someone already has it they’re not gonna be obliged to slog through them.
---
Leaves you with a rag tag group of pre mc raiders. Lvl 60 dungeons aren’t easy. Doable, but easy? No.
---
&gt; And you can't even transfer enchants to your alts.
---
This is a thing?
---
I re-rolled my Undead warlock (started out Alliance, got to 30 or something) after hitting 10 because both my Imp and my VW had garbage names. 
---
It's worth re-rolling, you're stuck with that name [FOR-EH-VER](https://media1.tenor.com/images/878a392c91c7853d09054cefef9ccc34/tenor.gif?itemid=5743944)
---
I always wanted to main a mage at some point. When I eventually leveled one through an xpac maybe wod? Idk I boosted one. Realized they weren’t at all like that and was very sad
---
honestly that was in one of my builds
---
Lol. I’ve got a job, one I work 6 days a week, but I have the luxury of making my own schedule and a love for classic that I will be able to make time this time around to raid instead of calling out of work to make raids.
---
Most guilds I've been in have been loot council, and they get falter when the council takes ages to distribute because they're hyper analyzing each players performance to inconsistent degrees. Some players get credited for always having consumes, some get credited for logging in early, some get credited for signing up early, etc. It ends up feeling a bit arbitrary. 
---
 If I ran a LC guild I would put items up to a roll much more often, whenever there isn't a clear order for the item. IE if you have 2 equally performing hunters, who both have perfect attendance, let them both roll on the first Chromag Xbow that drops, rather than arguing for 20 minutes and eventually giving it to the hunter whos been in the guild longer or whichever arbitrary reason gets chosen.
---
bruh, are you me. 5 &amp; 1 year old here
---
Just add milk.
---
Yea it got ridiculous in legion i could pull everything up to the next boss with no fear of dying or really needing help at all it was not till mythic +10 that things starting getting dangerous.
---
Oh my sweet summer child
---
Truly. There are few mechanics in mc that require thought, honestly the hardest fight is the core hound packs. Bwl steps it up a notch but is still in regards to current raids a fucking snooze fest. 
---
Aq and naxx bring the game more
---
In line with retail difficulty, with the added effect of vanilla just being a clunky game. 
---
I can’t wait.
---
In blizzards sourcecode.
---
Retrodruid
---
By res I mean reserving items.
---
Problem is, to be an effective SP you really need a lot of gear.
---
A SP with blue gear is nothing like a SP that got gear from MC/BWL. That's where the "melting faces" aspect comes into play.
---
But then again, shadow is an offspec and all the mages and warlocks will get those +spellpower gear before you.
---
So you have to raid week in and week put as holy and probably around release of ZG a dedicated shadowpriest got enough gear to be intimidating.
---
Threat system seems to work differently in Classic. Tanking beta dungeons I found it significantly easier to hold aggro compared to private servers. I don’t know how this will carry over to raiding but it’s just my observation.
---
And sober you doesn't?
---
Won’t be common in dungeons.
---
Kill fleeing mobs. The tank does not want to turn his back to the pull, and mobs tend to spread out when stacking on the tank. Therefore, the tank has trouble moving quickly to run down fleeing mobs. That's your job.
---
Boxers and middle schoolers arent in a faction conflict.
---
I mean, yeah. Sober me can also wait for appropriate times though. Haha
---
Rotan was a 12 year old boy too, when you rejected his advances he became obsessed and became a girl, you met him a couple years later now a 14 year old girl and started dating him.   Rotan will not be denied.
---
That was quite the rambling roller coaster of emotion.
---
That would have been hilarious if he was a girl pretending to be a boy and changed faction to follow.
---
Yes it is, as per [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor) 
---
What you're describing is a roundabout way of describing Damage Absorption on that same page. You're just generalizing it to calculate the difference in absorption at different damage reduction levels.
---
60% absorbs 5% less than 62%
---
WAKE UP
---
Not WoW related but I had a weird moment playing FFXIV. I was playing a female Hyur (human equivalent) and customization options in that game are way more elaborate. 
---
The guild leader comes up to me and says: “Man, I wonder if you’re as hot IRL as your character is”. I just replied with “dude, I’m a guy”. I couldn’t stop laughing and I could tell the poor guy didn’t know what to say.
---
i'v always felt it is the mage/healers job to always drink between pulls and if tank wants to pull faster just pull the mobs to you while sitting. this might be because i have always played whit a tank friend who HATES downtime and chain pulls non stop and i just hade to adapt but the runs go so much faster when you chain pulls sure it will cost you 40-60 water a dungeon but it is so worth it
---
This may be true and my experience is heavily tainted by pservers - those tips will still make the run smoother and you will annoy your tank/healer less if you follow them.
---
I did make that mistake once early in vanilla.
---
It's a war 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
Haha even if you were female irl, it's a pretty bad pickup line.
---
I want to join your guild so I can get tf on my hunter.
---
NE, especially Hunters, may there trees forever burn!
---
You're right friend, these tips are good for the nooberts.  Advanced tactic is deal 60% of the groups damage and kite multiple mobs while the tank rages.
---
Once you tested out your group with a couple early pulls most people are fine with that. Its just retail now is pull as fast as you can and that wont fly in classic.
---
Pinky and the BRIAN BRIAN BRIAN BRIAN BRIAN

It won't last forever, sadly. There's a huge period of time when the kids go to bed but you have to spend time with your wife, go to bed and get up for work. Rinse, repeat until Friday, when you might be lucky enough to get in an hour before going to bed extremely late...
---
I managed to get 7/8 pieces of T1 mage set because no one else wanted it
---
A master list of people in the server famous for ninja looting etc. Was always funny to watch them beg for a spot in a run only to be ignored.
---
It’s only one in ten instances it matters, so it’s very easy to forget, especially if the hunter/warlock is an alt. It’s a good idea whenever the you’re in a group to remind anyone in the party with a pet.
---
The worst thing to hear in vent from a hunter is where is my pet.
---
Wage theft.
---
Also don’t use banish unless it’s to prevent a wipe, the group doesn’t want to sit around for 20 seconds every pull waiting for a cc to end.
---
Where’s Mankrik’s wife?
---
From my experience pugs are not always smart.
---
I’m the one doing night shifts, which is why my gaming device is a laptop. 12hour shifts, 10 of those will be wow shifts ;)

PvP problems have PvP solutions.
---
I will not sugarcoat this. With the situation you describe there is not even a slim chance for you to take on the role of a guild MT for a progression guild (if you want to go past MC that is). I have maintanked for a guild thru-out MC and BWL and I can tell you: it is ALOT of work. A whole LOT of work. I can only imagine what it would be like to MT even further into AQ and Naxx. *Shudders*
---
You will be expected to attend 100% of raids. 40man and 20man alike, as well as attunment runs to various 5man dungeons such as MC attunement in BRD or Ony/BWL attunements in LBRS/UBRS.
---
Also go easy on the Life Tap
---
You have my support
---
Pro tip: You wont hear complaining if windfury is always down :)
---
I need it to train my weapon skills faster
---
&gt;. Is there a good way to handle tanking loot in a dkp system without just funneling the guild to 1 main tank?
---
by not doing that.
---
That's only for your pet's damage though... and pets don't yet scale with the Hunter, thus your pet doesn't do that much damage in Classic as they did in later expansions.
---
This means the realistic overall dps increase with this talent is something like 1% or even less.
---
I used to be a light sleeper. But then my daughter was born and now I would probably sleep through being dismembered, it’s incredible.

---
God damn little people, getting in the way of everything :(
---
Saving this for later!!
---
Haha :D and no i'm not going for first 60, I just need to make sure I don't get stuck in the zerge
---
Consistency
---
Sharding has its pros and cons. I tend to like the idea in principle, because it enables a dynamic world where you actually CHANGE THINGS in the physical environment by completing quests.
---
What they could do, of course, would be to make everyone who is in a party automatically be within the same shard, regardless of where they are in any questline. 
---
But I don't really think it's a big deal, at least not on PvE servers :)
---
I can’t remember any hard dungeons in vanilla that actually required cc/communication/cds like heroics did in early tbc. Maybe dire maul if you had terrible gear and didn’t know any of the mechanics? I can’t ever remember a pug scholo/ubrs group ever failing. I remember lots of heroic shadow labs groups giving up at the last boss.
---
Time traveler from 2022: "You guys gonna be sooo disappointed."
---
"But for girls to play the games the characters have to be cute! :3"
---
So it seems the answer is mostly no haha.
---
Don't quote me on this, but I believe leveling up professions is based on a Hidden experience bar. Every craft/gather doesn't give you a chance to level up, each craft/gather has a set "XP" value that is higher or lower depending on how low the craft/gather is to your current profession level.
---
The real question is, "can it be played on Linux?".
---
Would be real bad to get a cool mount drop and not be able to use it
---
And then getting ganked mercilessly for the entire evening... Yes I remember those.
---
*high five*
---
Missed the first several months of MC/BWL because of a stupid deployment :(
---
Yup. And now it doesn't take 30 minutes to verify the PayPal transaction like it did when they first added it.
---
Ah i see, i guess it's true for tier sets early on, but after that you compete for tokens while you also compete on off-pieces.
---
I'll miss my student week ends with no responsibility at all. Grabbing some cigarettes, cheap red wine and Ice Tea on Friday afternoon and play like there's no tomorrow until Sunday evening with a few friends on TS.
---
Well that was 15 years ago. Not really sure if I want that back. ;)
---
Wouldn't you be teleported out when everyone leaves the group?
---
That is situational. But for a newbie-tank, yes, ranged pulls 99% of the time.
---
Wife makes plans all the fucking time.
---
I was just reading up on that.  Going to need to find out who's going to be on the same schedule as me that first week on my warrior.
---
I disagree, since you'll spend most of your time in Aspect of the Cheetah while solo leveling anyways. At least that'd be optimal, since travel time makes up a lot of the total leveling time.
---
If you level mainly through dungeons or as a group however, IOTH of course would be the best choice.
---
Sit them down. While they get the hang of things try to explain seal fate dagger rogues and the importance of loot distribution. Next, interrupt them, physically. Yell "God damnit you pleb." 
---
But really. Just let them play and ask you questions. It's kind of fun being the wise old master. It's not fun to be the overbearing expert
---
Elemental Mastery is nowhere nearly good as Nature Swiftness. As elemental, your crit is very high and EM is redundant.
---
Unleashing 3-4K dmg instantly with LB cast followed by instant ChL and Shock is priceless
---
I dunno man. 
---
We live in the age of faking the shit out of everything. I expect to see a wave of terribly staged ones, people eating it up, and then people trying to unfunnily recreate it and post it to youtube, painfully unaware of how shitty it is.
---
step1: campaign and buy votes.
---
step2: Objectively come to the conclusion that I deserve all loots.
---
step3:  Reject their vote of no confidence.  Maintain leadership.
---
It’s a good idea if you’re running with unexperienced hunters. But it can be very frustrating as an experienced hunter to get «schooled» or getting demands from others in the group to dismiss a pet i.e places where it’s not neccesary if you know what you’re doing. Basically being handled as a noob when you’re the most experienced player in the group :P
---
Sure, if you plan on mainly leveling through dungeons or in a group, IOTH is the best. But if you solo level mainly through quests and the occasional dungeon, you'll spend most of the time in Cheetah anyways (even during most of the encounters).
---
There are a lot of questionable info here (mainly from very old pserver info that is not even accurate on them anymore).
---
As far as we know the, for leveling, the best weapon enchant with slow 2-H is Rockbiter (don't use in groups), and the best 1-h enchant no matter the speed is Windfury.
---
FT scales with faster weapons better but its still not best (until you get WF its best [level 30]). Rockbiter scales poorly with faster weapons.
---
Opposite of aids. It's the most enjoyable level range on the way to 60. The zone is densely populated with both npcs and players. As such, it's non-stop action and provides endless ganking opportunities.
---
Yes and no. Depends on your build too.
---
If you don't know what you are doing, you will have a very bad time. I think you should watch Skarm videos on youtube to learn about warrior tanking. He's basically a god.
---
You don't have any real AoE, but you can use engineering bombs, demoralizing shout, and tab targetting to get AoE threat. AoE is where most mediocre warrior tanks will struggle, but once you learn what to do, it will be easyish kinda.
---
Also if you tank raids for a guild, you will basically have the biggest swinging dick and all the tank gear will go straight to you if you need it. Only downside is you will need to use a lot of expensive flasks and potions and stuff for raiding as a tank.
---
Should you?
---
On my original character I got stuck for what seemed like weeks around level 48 because I ran out of convenient quests and refused to travel across the continent for a single quest. I'm thinking that Hinterlands flower one you pick up in Tanaris.

Funny thing, I already am.  The secret, we're DINKs.  Plenty of free time to do what we want.  It's pretty amazing.
---
Eventually I made a macro for just before the balcony
---
- Shieldslam (your main BIG-threat ability) Use this on every cooldown
---
- Revenge (your highest threat-per-rage ability) also use this when ever it lights up (use shieldblock to trigger it).
---
- Sunder (Your baseline filler ability) Spam this all the time when you arent using shieldslams and revenge.
---
- Heroic strike (Your rage-dump) Only use when you have more rage than you can spend.
---
Rank 13. Casual. ;)

You can trade looted gear in classic. So being a ninja wouldn't be the same. Back then you could just say "Oh shit, sorry" and at least try to convince people that it was a mistake. You could say stuff like "yea soz the icon looks exactly the same as the item I wanted so I didn't even check the name before needing". Now everyone can just tell that you're a dick without hesitation so there's a lot less mindgames.
---
Which ia good btw, I hate ninja looters.

Orc rogues look goofy as fuck and don't fit thematically at all
---
I asked my wife to leave our flat for a week from August 26 (teacher on summer break) so she doesn't have to witness what's going to happen... and she gladly agreed ≤3
---
when I was younger on my birthday night NOBODY would fuck with me. No asking me to take out trash, do other chores. was the best
---
Tanking??? As if! It’s all about smashing in n00bs with my epic 2 hander
---
&gt;Weapon skill is a BIG GAME.
---
Which is why all Warrior tanks should roll Humans.
---
Can confirm about pservers, I was 12 when vanilla launched and i played religiously until Cata when I just burned out, I figured I got over it and it was time in my life go move on...
---
Then with the news of classic coming out I some how didn't care at first, I thought "oh that's cool" and pretty much forgot about it. 
---
Then the beta came out and watching twitch streamers play really had me wanting to play. Downloaded a pserver 1.12 client and was on my way.. I was only intending on getting to like 20 or 30 but I'm now 40 and I had to force my self to quit to wait for Classic.
---
But the thing that really stuck out to me was how wrong everyone was about the rose tinted glasses, nostalgia clouding your judgement ect ect... Well I can say I'm firmly in the "it's just a better game" camp.
---
Not sure the only problem was the WoW playtime when it comes to why you gained weight but probably not a bad thing to not go with as much WoW this time around (after launch week I mean of course lol).
---
I miss that... so much of Trade channel now is just shitposting and trolling. Worse, it's not even inventive or intelligent trolling.
---
Gonna give engi a miss at this stage. Not that it isn’t good though.. I’ll definately be PvPing but likely as a disc healer... or even if I go Shadow I anticipate that there’ll be enough in the toolkit to survive reasonably well. Especially as dwarf with fear ward and the insta heal :) 
---
I don’t anticipate levelling herb @ 40 with a mount will take long at all tbh. Couple hrs tops.  Remember you can just run up to herb nodes, fear anything you’ve aggro’d, and run away. 
---
To be honest there wouldn’t be much harm in levelling Tailoring @ 60, youll outlevel everything so it’ll be easy to go back and holy nova aoe / farm humanoids for cloth for a few hrs in each zone
---
Oh, well then fair enough. If you gotta bribe some healers, you gotta bribe some healers.
---
If I can lock it at 60 fps it should be ok and work fine up until its time to start PvP and raid more serious again.
---
He was a special guy, everybody on my server knew him :D he might be an exception tbh
---
Unless you name the char "lolurdedQQ," it's not really an undead rogue.
---
Returning mana doesn't matter once you get to the point where you can spam without going oom. Healing more, you mean randomly overhealing more?
---
How is the bottom of the voidwalker inside the summoning circle, but the gnome stands outside at the edge of the wall and the VW is still behind her?
---
12 hour shifts. Any job with 12 hour shifts really
---
Of course not. I could have eaten better and not drank. But I was a single male living in a shitty small town I hated. I had nothing to do but play wow and go to work
---
Great advice, thankyou!  
---
I'm going Skinning and Mining while i level, vendoring everything i get, then I'm switching Skinning to Eng because i'm going to pvp a lot! Definitely going to attempt to get a few devilsaurs too if possible haha.
---
I killed a gnome and got honor. This is positive, since it was one less gnome and one more HK for me!
---
Ganking alliance mid tram ride.
---
Hehehehehe
---
Starting my own guild, been poaching people I know from retail and real life. Shit is gonna be lit
---
it was like one of the best cloaks you get in the game for certain classes
---
You're right. I removed the subsequent mentions of Auto Shot inside the rotations. Thanks for bringing that up!
---
I also added Multi Shot in the rotations, since most of the guides suggest using it - but only if the damage per mana spent is greater than the value of your arcane shot.
---
It's not as much dead, but the margin for it to work narrowed because that extra 3% crit nerf. You wanted some crit on gear, but now you need 3% more to hit the breakpoints people on Pservers ran.
---
I did this in Runescape as a kid. Made some pretty good gold too. I had almost convinced this guy to give me a Santa Hat for Christmas but he backed out at the last second (they were worth a ton of gold). I should've upped my game and sent him fake pics or something, probably would've sealed the deal. Lol.
---
Those were the days. Can relate to this in many ways dear friend. Often I wish for these times to repeat themselves but sadly I realise that it’s not the times that changed but I have. I have less patience. My views have become more critical. A lot more takes to impress me. Not mention school is a lot less commitment than work is (not saying it’s harder, that depends on your job) in general. 
---
But I share your feelings and wish for them to return one day...
---
People overestimate the community blacklisting evil doers. Back in the day nobody gave a shit at least in my experience. My brother and I shared accounts, he used to set up a whole onyxia raid, set it to master loot just as she’s about to go down and loot it all. He did this twice. He also ninjad a bunch of stuff from dungeons, stole npc tags, tricked people into killing themselves in duels and stole gold. He was a little shit and we were young so it was really funny but it still makes me laugh thinking about it. 
---
I did it maybe once back then but today, I can’t do that stuff, just doesn’t feel right. I’d feel too bad about it. To be honest, I love it and I hope there are people who do this in classic.
---
You can take a man from the ocean, but you can't take the ocean from the man.
---
r/publicfreakout is why I prefer staying at home as much as possible. People are fucking crazy out there.
---
Sounds like cool and reasonable dad
---
I think I've talked my partner into playing WoW so with any luck she will be hooked and then that means I'm free to play all night 😁 well as long as I keep the tea coming.
---
\*Boar killing intensifies\*
---
Should I play male dwarf priest or female dwarf priest!?
---
Yeah it is, da fuck you smokin? Pass dat shiii
---
I nearly broke a guild when I got this on my Paladin.
---
Tldr 
---
Fire - slightly higher dmg, less utility
---
Frost - decent dmg, high utility, can be boring since your using frostbolt 95% of the time, good aoe with imp blizzard
---
Arcane - no
---
So in terms of efficiency frost is the go to specc.
---
The content gets cleared 1st day on servers that disable world buffs during progression. You're just assuming too much.
---
Nice catch. I removed it from the original post.
---
Only in raids, not in 5-mans/UBRS.
---
It's part of the game and they play it knowing it's a possibility. I too will be having my fun poaching the lowbies as an undead rogue! /Spit
---
You're not counting special attacks, parry haste, attack speed buffs, adds, etc
---
This has been tested by a lot of people, it's uptime is known to be reliable.
---
Thanks for the info you guys/gals are really giving me the information i needed.
---
yeah thats the point i think shaman looks cool to play and has a support/heal specc. there will be a ton of mages and rogues and maybe its good to have some utility thats not pure damage
---
Dude I forget that Warrior's name but he was badass. His ending was my favorite. It's been almost 15 years since I read that trilogy, I may have to get it for my preLaunch beach trip as garbo reading to hype me.
---

You're all safe. So many are rolling warrior.. They can't afford to leave food behind 🤟
---
Nope. ;)
---
WoW version: We're gonna take over the Rugged Leather market!
---
In BG's and team-based PvP, how do Resto Shamans fare when focused by the enemy team, for example by Rogues or Warriors? How does the options available/playstyle differ from when Earth Shield and Nature's Guardian is present, and later Riptide? I am exploring my options between Priest, Druid and Shaman.
---
In the same vein, is there a defensive/support build for Resto Shamans (*i.e.* not 30/0/21) with, for example, Elemental Warding, Guardian Totems and Nature's Swiftness? Or is this playstyle more suited to Priests and Druids?
---
Having fun is productive
---
Yeah i really worry about the info coming from Pservers because i know the numbers are gonna be off by a bit. I'll ultimately be leveling however i feel comfortable but was hoping for some good info. Ill try both 2H and Shield and quick 1h just to see what feels better to me. Solo play i feel 2H and a swing timer will get me where i need to go quicker but im willing to try anything.
---
Go for it but run a Gnome rogue for maximum disrespect.
---

I have a Warlock-specific non-instanced farming method I'm really looking forward to employing. Should net decent gold through regular drops with a small chance for a jackpot, and the Warlock-specific and non-instanced parts are vital to my enjoyment of a good farming session.
---
Also if the tank moves from melee range while someone else still is, they are in for a world of hurt. Many people learned that on turtle boss in ToT
---
Excuses
---
The wand shoot spell
---
If you’re gonna roll priest, get a good wand off the AH and shoot your little wand and try not to die. Its one of the more difficult classes to level up. Right next to warrior. Yeah, you got healing. But no, you wont have much mana or dps. Im running priest aswell. Just gotta stick with it. It gets better after 40ish
---
I leveled a shaman on a private to level 40 just now, honestly the only experience that can match it is druid. It's amazing
---
In this case he did. That Orc thinks the sea is da poop
---
They are talking about BoE's 
---
If it's tradable it's worth exactly AH value and not one copper more or less to everyone present, no one needs it more than anyone else.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=5019/shoot](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=5019/shoot) Says it's instant with 0sec gcd.
---
Not sure if that it's true, then you can macro a wand attack on to all spell casts
---
Yes wanding triggers GCD. 
---
If something this small will make you not choose a class, though, idk..
---
I'd recommend not playing a caster ha
---
Wand priest is extremely easy to level lol.
---
Christ, i get that these Tips may be useful to some, but way to imply retail players have 0 concept of how basic dungeon mechanics work.
---
Classic is not hard, and anyone playing retail having done even a single dungeon at heroic or higher will have no problem at all
---
The thing with the priest mc'ing you is why i love playing a priest freaking out the other race for a split second just to putting a buff on them instead of harming them.
---
If you want bis gear for elemental you will need to wait for aq40 and be in a guild that clears it. The t2.5 is amazing for you. And that will take it's time and you probably will be healing in raids
---
Hey!  Your outlook on wow lines right up with mine.  I have a wife, a demanding job but I still want to progress through all the content at a reasonable pace.  I'm an old vanilla vet.
---
Any idea on raids times?
---
The answer is to have a meme spec as your alt. Bring it to alt runs and fill in spots when you can, but earn your keep on your "real character". 
---
Nobody wants to give a Ret Pally an Ashkhandi...unless it's the Main Tank's alt and he's doing his second clear.
---
Curses are situational. If you've got the extra points in Imp CoEx, which you should anyway if you're deep affliction, it's pretty good for solo play.
---
In a premade environment, your most valuable curse is probably Tongues.
---
I dunno. I still drink beer. I don't regret my early wow days. I had a blast but I am happy to report that I am in much better health than I was then.
---
Tip to tanks if You have Agro On a mob with 20% hp stop building more rage instead save it next pull and Then your damage dealers cant over Agro Anyway ( how to be loved as tank)
---
You are playing on pserver now or on retail ?
---
Haha, indeed mate. Some kind of weapon vendor would suit him quite well as a part time job after retirement.. seeing it as Heron means Blade master (according to the Wheel of Time series)
---
*Salute*
---
Can't even tell you how much that sounds like me, though the hours are a little different.
---
yes you can do this, i do this on retail. i generally like to use shift click for autolooting so i even macro in set to auto loot and then turn it off and its completely seamless
---
Getting paid to play WoW Classic. Living the dream there!
---
Reading all those stories here similar to yours makes me think there is strong need for "night guild" where most activity would focus between 9pm and 2 am. So many people play only at this weird time.
---
Or are there such guilds already ?
---
Those legs remind me of krokodil addiction.
---
Yeah, def. Should never have gone though the Dark portal on that char..
---
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work.
---
Lol. I was always a light sleeper and having a daughter now too I dare say it's even worse! Means burning the candle with wow is not such a smart move anymore, why I've booked a week off work for launch.
---
Absolutely stunning, would you maybe see your way to making one for Silithus/Ahn’Qiraj?
---
How to turn a total non-issue into a deal breaker.
---
Shoot triggers the gcd. So if you shoot you need to wait 1.5sec to cast a spell.  
---
  
---
Shoot itself is not in the gcd, so yes you can macro sw:p -&gt; shoot just fine, but shoot is a 1.5 sec cast, and you can always just hit shoot straight after casting a spell so not sure why a macro would be that helpful.
---
Dont under estimate fishing and cooking to make a profit.
---
As a fellow paladin I think they gave you stuff because of compassion not because you were playing a female character.
---
I can't see anyone mentioning that troll have 1% higher dodge in base stats.  
---
For raiding, troll warrior.
---
pvp, orc warrior.
---
taurens are cool, but warstomp is a cast - so when casted, you can't block,dodge parry etc.
---
I can't see anyone mentioning that troll have 1% higher dodge in base stats.
---
Isn't it better to have a macro for switching between aspects? Travel time is important, but so is kill speed
---
Well it kinda makes all your instant casts a 1.5 second cast if you are auto shooting.
---
Little known fact, all the murdered strippers in the us are turned into zombies and put in wow for this purpose.
---
If you are ally then ele shammys will give you trouble as a fresh 60. And maybe hunters. Otherwise you are all Gucci my friend.
---
I consider myself a veteran. 
---
I've got a group of friends wheres some of them is completely new. My job is to help and guide as many people as i can. I will be tanking alot of instances and I'll make a macro of the basic things people needs to know. 
---
If you have any questions, I'd be happy to try to help you out. Just PM me :)
---
Word.
---
Nice work! I would love to see male human/ ud warlock t2 !
---
You can theorycraft all you want, it's been tested.
---
main hunter here.this is 100% true
---
You're a true hero. Not all will understand. But it's ok. They aren't even 60s.
---
Oh man, I remember the times so well. Parents were always a obstacle in one fashion or another. The mornings became rough but the nights became longer. Good times.
---
“hey I didn’t like something about the game when I tried it, IT MUST BE BUGGED ON PSERVERS RIGHT???”
---
god this subreddit finds every little excuse to shit on pservers
---
I played a Forsaken rogue. I was basically attacked by every Ally that saw me. That class/race combo is kill-on-sight for them, kinda like Night Elf hunters on the horde side.
---
It’s okay. Don’t worry after a little bit of time you will be spread out in levels and it won’t be anything to be afraid of.
---
Nah man. One of the main reasons I play this game is because it's a grind. It' s a grind leveling, it's a grind at 60, it's a grind in PvE, a grind in PvP. I enjoy the process of slowly progressing. I'm able to both enjoy myself in the moment as well as enjoy the thought of eventually reaching my goals in the future. And when I get tired of the grind I just stop playing for a while, until I'm ready to enjoy the grind again.
---
10k is nothing bro
---
If we shared them here, they wouldn’t really be “under the radar” anymore eh?
---
Wait, fear doesn't count as CC? I thought that being Warlocks Rogues and Mages (and hunters but whatever) the 3 pure dps specs with CC it was on them to poli, sap, fear the pack them focus one thing at a time.
---
If I roll warlock I don't count towards the CC bucket till get succubus?
---
That is truely what made wow amazing. You can explore everything! Even if you dont find anything, its still rewarding as hell :D
---
No need to be so hostile about it. There's a lot of nuance that people don't always realize. Your point is valid and useful information, but someone isn't a dimwit for not having realized it before.
---
''why is this in master loot?''
---
I would. Im not addicted to money. I live a humble life, but I make enough money and i live confortably.
---
Why does the raid leader put up with that? If the rules were stated at the start he should be removed from the raid.
---
Then link those test.
---
My grain of salt, if you like outdoor (or indoor but is more complicated) just go out looking for anny activities group, like trecking groups, running, climbing, cycling... i don't know, even cooking or dancing!
---
With 40's, like me, i think is the best way of having fun withh others, meet people etc. And there is more of this groups than you can imagine, believe me!
---
GL!
---
It looks interesting to say the least.
---
I'm surprised you had to go as far as you did before someone tried to chat you up. 
---
I remember during vanilla being hit on by some random weeb every other day if I was playing a female character.
---

Why do you reply to this comment but not the others where you are proved wrong?
---
Mage's mana is used to polymorph...
---
Well we slowly died out, because most people on the Horde side didn't do as much RP as we did.
---
I mean we had whole Storylines and Murdermysteries we RP'd. So the RP was really amazing, but then Molten Core came out and people started raiding and there was really nothing like us on the Horde side.
---
You don't even have a real Tavern in Orgrimmar FFS.
---
I feel like with the Stormwind Guard and Goldshire in general the RP on the Alliance side can flourish. At least I feel in my experience, people who want to RP hardcore flock more to the Alliance side. I mean I had like people downright say to me, they went Horde on an RP server, because the community is much more chilled, but if no one is RPing except for you, your Guild just dies.
---
I don't know if it's the location, or that people have issues writing or identifying with the Horde in a RP aspect.
---
Maybe I was on the wrong Server who knows, but I rather Raid now on a normal PvE Server as a Horde player and for RP I would just Twink on an RP Server on the Alliance side.

when you spent 28 years on the same project you which made you a fortune you start thinking "maybe thats enough" and start enjoying life

So, basically the same as mythic plus keys 15 and higher, minus having to worry about threat

---
Polymorph isn't needed for every single pull. It's not even needed for the vast majority of pulls.

Maybe he feels he has made enough money for one lifetime and wants to devote more time to his family? Or perhaps he wants to start up a new company? Or just needs a change from what he is doing now?  Whatever, good luck to him in whatever comes next.

There has been rumors circulating for a while that Bobby Kotak and his money hungry cronies have slowly been creeping in to each and every Blizz meeting regardless of Dev, Marketing or just a quick pow pow. Many are of the opinion now that Michael Morhaime was the wall keeping this Kotak army at bay and with him now gone Activision has invaded has invaded Blizzard.
---
Problem being? 🤔
---
Im going to request gnome rogue with t2 now please.
---
I’d “bone” her
---
Just tell them the truth, that this game is going to kill their social life outside Azeroth, they are going to gain extra weight, their health will suffer in extreme, and they  are probably have difficulties with family and partners.
---
But the point is that is goinng to be super fun, and worth all of this.
---
I could probably pay off the debts of most of my close family members with 100k up front. Shit I might even give up video games in general for 100k right now.
---
I started playing WoW in 2011 in early Cataclysm, and felt in love for the game. For both the lore and the gameplay. I was probably 13 or 14.
---
Well I started playing Vanilla on pservs during WoD at the age of 18-19 and was hyped since then
---
Now I'm 22 and still hyped for Classic, as I never wanted to invest time in Raiding on private.
---
If Classic came out earlier, you bet I would no life it :)
---
Tell them it's like getting your allowance as a kid, then getting together with your friends and walking 10 miles on a blistering hot summer day to go to the convenience store just to buy a popsicle. You put in all that work, get sun burned and sweat your ass off, all to get some purple-colored ice on a stick, but god damn if it doesn't feel worth it when you're sitting in the shade with your best buddies licking that ice pop and feeling like the biggest ballers in town.
---
Mage/Paladin/Warrior boss types sure sounds like thematic design to me...the types come from the wow bestiary.
---
I'd rather recommend to build nightfall and go for loads of mp5, speccing improved totems and totemtwist for your melees while providing nf buff for your casters.
---
You won't deal great damage in raids anyway but you can provide solid support. Nf uptime is pretty bad as enhance but it's something.
---
CCsare important. Other thi gs ppl wrote in the post.  But I love that the dungeon play is different in retail and classic. In retail you just play through it ASAP but in classic dungeons you need to take every step seriously. Strategise and just be careful. It takes time I know.
---
My current gaming rig have 2 x 27" 144hz monitors but I kinda like the idea of going really big to be as you said immersed into the game a bit more and be able to use a more comfy chair than I currently have. Make the gaming place in my home a bit more gaming and less office oriented.
---
I had DPS constantly complaining in vanilla because I wasn't using sunder to generate threat in UBRS and it was affecting their damage output.
---
You sound like trump
---
 Let me preface this by saying, everything is my opinion, and we used some of the components but not all in the guild where i was an officer. We where a huge casual guild with a core raidteam of about 20 people, and 20 fill spots from a pool of 100+ members that would sometimes raid, sometimes not, so maybe this is not the best for extreme HC guilds. 
---
**What form of raid loot distribution is the** ***best*****?**
---
0 sum DKP system with a attrition mechanic and bonuses.
---
A system like this is quite complex, and we needed a excel sheet just to do the math at times :D
---
Basicly, we used a 0 sum DKP system, meaning, what go's out (is spent) is what is earned by the raid. (when a item costs 40DKP, 1 player pays 40 DKP, and the entire raid earns 1 DKP per person (if a full raid).
---
The problem with a 0 sum (or any DKP system really) is 
---
1:  its not based  on anything other then attendance when kiling bosses, at progression raids, you might wipe all night, and earn NOTHING.
---
2: Inflation, people with high attendance rates tend to earn more DKP then they can spend, and horde it.
---
So we had 2 mechanics to change that.
---
1: We had bonuses for stuff like preparing early, having flasks ready, joining progression raids, etc
---
2: This leads to inflation, so we also had a attrition mechanic that basicly ate 5% of your DKP per week, this hits the high attendance people and old guild members the most, so newer players had a chance to get some stuff. (after their 4 week trial during which they could earn DKP, but not spend it)
---
In order to combat people making agreements (priest 1 asking priest 2 to not bid, so priest 1 can get The eye of Divinity cheaper) we had minimum prices on progression raid items wich would go down every time an item dropped untill content was on farm, then it was just bids.  (so it would be 50DKP for the 1st drop, 45 the 2nd week, 40 the 3rd, down to 20 in week 7, and then its just bidding)
---
It took a long time, and tons of tweaks and resets wich did upset the guild at times, but i feel we ended up with a fair system for both new and old members, both casuals and the class leaders that would attend every raid.
---
Only exception was the MT, he'd get what he need for his main spec 1st, always. And he payed full price wich would sometimes mean he went into -DPK. But he could still take items for offspec following the normal rules. (main-spec&gt;off-spec ofcourse)
---
 **What form of raid loot distribution fails more often than not?** 
---
I will alwyas be of the opinion that DKP tends to be fairer then Loot Coulsils, just because the 2nd one tends to lead to non-fun, non-desirable behavior of both the counsil and members. 
---
 **What form of raid loot distribution will your guild use?** 
---
Any guild i join will have a DKP system most likely.
---
 **What form of raid loot distribution is ideal for pick-up groups (PUGs)?** 
---
Master looter by the raid leader (to combat ninja's) and then just rolling based on spec
---
 **What guild** ***structure*** **is ideal; that is, are class leaders useful?** 
---
We had GM, and then class officers (CO's) for each class . All officers could lead raids, some better then others, mostly the GM, the MT or me (priest/heal officer) would lead raids.
---
Before a pull, we would have CO's explain to theirclasses  the mechanics, and how to deal with it in a separate chat channel. When they give the "ready" signal, the Raid Leader performed 1 last ready check, and we went in. After a  wipe we would analyze both in those channels, and officer channel so make adjustments for the next pull
---
When not raiding, its just easyer to have more contacts available for other guilds, new members etc to ask questions to, so yeah, having officers and class leaders is very usefull.
---
 **How will modern tools, like Discord, influence guild organization/structure?** 
---
No clue, we had TeamSpeak back in the day, but back then only "nerds" used it, and normies would only get on for raids. I hope now Disc will make more people be on voicechat more of the time. For HC  guilds, i'm sure the demands to use for instance TeamViewer, to be able to even log in when you are at work for world bosses etc, might be added... but for most casuals.... i dont really see that much tech that is life changing for WOW. I wonder if, since now communication is easyer cross-faction, more/less ganking will be a thing. And if guild coorporation will be bigger in factions when world bosses are up etc. 
---
 **Did you use voice chat when raiding in retail Vanilla, and will you use it in Classic?** 
---
I payed for the TeamSpeak Server :P so yeah, will be on disc... Hope there will be a server for the realm i play on :D
---
How much slower are you than a Hunter?
---
Quitting his job to play classic. That's some dedication.
---
He left the company to play classic wow 24/7
---
But you can recreate them from scratch

Fear isn't used in dungeons bc it can pull extra mobs. Most groups won't ask you to use succubus bc 90% of warlocks are braindead and can't comprehend how to effectively use their pets. If you're part of the 1% that offers to cc as a lock ppl will respect you.
---
Aussie mate!
---
I'll be leveling a priest exclusively with a friend, and my solo character is going to be an undead rogue. Ever since I started playing in TBC, I've never actually had a pure DPS class as a main. I don't plan to raid on two characters, so the rogue is just to mess around in the open world. Gank, gather and disrupt.
---
NElf Rogues, Hunters and Druids. They are by far the most likely to gank Horde.
---
There was a lot I missed out, the information I put in the video was meant to be used loosely as a guideline rather than an absolute - I agree with you that doing every quest can be tedious especially with travelling across the zone constantly, you lose a lot of time - but that's up to what the individual player wants to do. I wouldn't personally do every single quest, there are certain ones I would skip in certain zones too.
---
Levelling with a group is a horrible idea but tons of people out there level with friends, I've done 1-60 1x in a group multiple times on pservers (even though the statistics aren't accurate for XP gain or whatever) - it's up to the individual.
---
I didn't check it myself but I saw posts of people claiming it to be doable on the beta.
---
Exactly!
---
Think of shoot as another instant cast spell.
---
But also I say it every chance I can: Gnomes don't deserve rights.
---
This can be said about any position ... think about something other than yourself for a minute. Play with a mindset of 'what can I do, that is easy for me, to make the job of another easier.'
---
Also: know your healer and position yourself in way group-heal can reach you.
---
Why? Healers can drink while the tank pulls if nobody is taking heavy damage. The warlock needs to be doing dps while the tank is in combat. It's more efficient for the warlock to use the healers mana rather than their own. Warlocks have the worst spirit regen of any class for a reason.
---
Outside the box maybe.
---
I think one "problem " will be that people can ninja loot fairly often, without having their reputation ruined. People just doesn't care as much these days, the game is easier and doesn't feel as 'serious' as it used to. Back in the day I remember feeling like this was my only shot to get this or that item, or being awestruck with a rare epic BoE dropped that people had literally never seen before.
---
Now it's more like oh yeah that has 1.5% drop chance, cool. Private server characters are min maxed even though they're closing in a month. People unsestand way better how ""easy"" it is to gear up compared to vanilla where AQ geared characters were worth hundreds if not thousands of real dollars. 
---
I'm pretty certain that if you hearth back to org after someone in your group ninajed and spam "ninjaplayer ninjaed my blue!" Most of the replies are just gonna be "lol rekt ", "I ninjaed ur mum" and then maybe 2-3people put him on ignore, and even more puts you on ignore for spamming..
---
You also forgot your full stop at the end of your edit.
---
I’d prefer a tauren, thanks
---
I wonder how resistances differ in classic. With the lower armor, we might actually still be looking at a relative threat gain to magic damage classes, regardless of the lower crit and higher parry.
---
Would be cool if they had automatic Armory synchronization once Blizzards chooses to make an official Armory.
---
SM Ruin to start at 60 and then switch over to DS Ruin. Either way you'll be spamming shadowbolts and popping Limited Invuln Pots when a bolt crits and you snag aggro.
---
Idk if it happened during Vanilla, since I didn't play back then, but that bug lasted a couple of months during TBC. I remember my friend getting pretty upset over it back then.
---
Trolls look sort of cool in a lanky crazy voodoo magic man kinda way. Their dance is great, and their melee animations are pretty sick too. That kick animation is BiS.
---
If you play retail I'd imagine a lot of reasonably large guilds will be starting a classic arm, mine definitely are with about 10-20 keen people
---
This is too real.
---
Hmm but wouldn't Ghostly Strikes be even more annoying then? Considering chance.
---
I honestly think Improved Sap, at the very least, is mandatory, even though the 10% chance of failure is gonna absolutely suck big time
---
I know a god damn hero when I see it!

---
Just explain the difference (pros and cons) about PvE vs PvP. She might even like the idea of ganking the shit outta ppl as much as you and you can do it together.
---
Always levelled as fire, knowing thar I will be frost for a looong time as 60
---
Oh yea, that sounds amazing. Definitely gonna give that a go!
---
Haha thanks!
---
if she's the kind of coward who can't make it on a pvp server it gives you a chance to ditch her before you're locked in by kids with terrible genes
---
This is my plan as well but as a orc warrior. My goal is to get rank 10 and 11, kill onyxua and see her head on the pike in org. That's it.
---
Tbh with classic drop rates you'll probably be well over 10 before you farm that much cloth
---
Without any explanation? Couldn't he like just vendor it or drop it for something shinier?
---
The Shadow Council employed many rogues and assassins, and Thrall’s parents were killed by some of them. So saying they don’t fit thematically when they’ve been part for orc lore forever is just idiotic.
---
Maybe I'm misunderstand your post, but that's not how taunt works. Taunt puts you ~5% above the highest threat temporarily and a hit turns that temporary threat into permanent threat.
---
Taunt is still going to make that mob attack you.
---
The abominations known as pink haired gnome warriors need to be exterminated.
---
You're better off doing the following
---
+ Go to a PvE server
---
+ Flag yourself for PvP (/pvp)
---
You can be constantly in fear for your life, it's just that you won't get to be the initiator of the ganking (no first strike policy). She doesn't even have to be flagged for PvP (just you) which means she can 'opt in' to PvP and help you out in the event you get attacked. That or she can just sit back and giggle as you get violated and eye-roll because you were the one who flagged yourself.
---
Think about this from the other perspective. The majority of the people who opt into 'classic' are likely to be veterans of the game (from all those years ago). This is a group of people who are intentionally playing a decades old game because they enjoy the gameplay, and not because they're after some fancy new story/plot developments. That means you'd (on a PvP server) have a bunch of veterans with time to kill and no inhibitions about sinking in time/resources.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
You've gone to the time/effort to convince her to try it, the last thing you want to do is have her pissed off because of things that are outside of her control.
---
Unless you wanted to exclusively play a Rogue (where being unable to initiate is a deal-breaker) you're going to be under just as much risk on a PvE server (flagged for PvP) as if you were on a PvP server. It's simply a question of whether you're happy to always be the underdog and unable to bully others.
---
I will lvl my rogue only to gank people like you.
---
With lots of love of course 😍
---
It's because there's nothing else quite like it. Other MMOs are fucking garbage. I'm not particularly into the "lore" of Warcraft (especially with all the goddamn retcons and other bullshit), so I don't care about that aspect, it's just that it's  technically a good game.
---
Give me a new game with Classic's mechanics and I'd at least give it a try. It's kinda the same deal with Eve Online - it's unique. There's nothing else quite like it.
---
It won’t take many 60s to clear you out, if your only experience is fighting other lowbies. 
---
Also if you don’t raid you’ll get shitstomped by your average 60 in raid gear.
---
But do what you gotta do
---
High school senior year here lmao, I'm only getting into uni this year after a 10 year hiatus... only for classic to be released. History repeats itself.
---
If you like gold, leveling fishing is anything but a waste of time. Also it's relaxing as fuck, I too enjoy leveling it while leveling up.
---
You'll lose a few hours for sure but you can level cooking and fishing at the same time and be ready for endgame consumable production right away which is great!
---
Doable, yes.  But not easy, and a random group doing it for the first time will probably just die.
---
A lot of people still have the mentality of leather for leather wearers and mail for mail wearers. There's going to be loads of drama even in WC where a lot of leather pieces a BiS for mail users for a loooong time. 
---
I'm planning to roll a rogue, but if Leggings of the fang drops I would be completely okay with a warrior rolling for them, but I know a lot of people won't and the amount of drama will be off the chain.
---
you could insent them by "if you attend raids even though you dont need stuff you get placed higher and higher at the next raid content"
---
until you wipe because your group isnt ready, things go bad, etc etc. Theres as much reason to wait for a mage as a priest.
---
Really? I had an orc rogue towards the end of classic and I feel like the stun resist saved my ass on more than a couple of occasions, especially while leveling. A lot of me killing a mob, another rogue attempts to open with cheap shot, resist, I vanish/sap (a macro I had specifically for rogue on rogue encounters) wait till my health went back up, kill the wannabe ganker, kek and teabag until they released. I remember in a duel against an undead buddy resisting his cheap shot and then immediately resisting his kidney, it's almost like I could hear him throw his keyboard
---
He didn't say not to use it, he said to go easy on it.
---
I've had a lock lifetap down to 1hp every pull, causing me as the healer to blow CDs and mana pots to save him because there is some aoe damage and I can't wait to fit him into my uptime/downtime rotation (to maximize mp5).
---
You shouldn't be lifetapping below 70% health most times
---
I’ve played on private servers and other older MMO’s in my living room on a 70” 4K.  Didn’t notice any input lag at all.  It’s not something I do all that frequently, but it does make everything feel more immersive when I do.  Will play this way when Classic launches occasionally as well.  
---
My issue with it is that I have to use my laptop, which isn’t great and hardwire my mouse and keyboard into that... Which means I have to pull one of our sitting chairs over and plop it right in front of the tv, and then lay a piece of plywood across the arms so I have somewhere for my mouse and keyboard to sit...  Kind of a hassle and not an arrangement my wife would be ok with on any sort of regular basis.
---
On a sidenote, when I logged back in yesterday the char has been randomly assigned to the Eonar realm. No idea why
---
For me that's part of the fun of an orc rogue, their stealth is downright goofy
---
Loot Council for guilds that will be ahead of the curve in progression.  DKP for slower progressing guilds.
---
PUGS: bis /roll first, non bis after
---
Super reliant on gear comparatively, though
---
Because being a good damage dealer != dealing high amounts of damage.
---
Being a good damage dealer = knowing when to deal damage and when not to, first and foremost. Maximizing the damage that you do is secondary to this.
---
[Meh. This is the REAL mage anthem.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w)
---
I've always appreciated the DPS who acted as OTs for me the healer. It makes a huge difference.
---
No idea. I think he secretly was enjoying the drama.
---
Just tell them it’s a great game and they should play it when it releases.  And then just let him play and learn at his own pace.  Just like you did back when you first started playing.  I’d suggest sitting with him in Discord and answering questions he has as they come up.
---
That's the point. If you pull as a dps you left the boundaries of your role. If you want the tank to speed up then tell him. There is no other way to get him to speed up.
---
It's like a healer that does not heal you through a boss aoe because you forgot to sheep an add. He will tell you that you were expected to sheep the add.
---
**In the moment you pull the next pack because you think the tank is slow - you try to force your way on to somebody else and thats the reason the tank gets angry. And he has all right to be.**
---
I'd go with your team character being the alt.
---
Also, if you have one member that's often can't/isn't playing, everyone could make a third alt so you have a smaller team without that player. If it's hard to get more than 2 of you online at any time, then you could make a set of alts for playing as duos. That way no matter who is available to play, you can all play at the same level.
---
I'd probably have each subparty progress down a different path of zones to keep it interesting.
---
I personally enjoy having lots of alts for the variety, and so I can try out lots of professions. If you play for getting to level 60, this might not be such a good idea.
---
My groups very rarely wipe. I played a tank in vanilla, we burned through instances while levelling, we smashed the baron run. You're probably one of the priests who cries because you're not at 100% mana for every single pull.
---
With a group of 5 skilled players vanilla was easy. I'll be levelling inside instances as much as possible with 4 skilled players (all completed Naxx in vanilla) and won't have to deal with players like you.
---
And Queens of the Stone Age, A Perfect Circle, Nightwish, Rise Against, Megadeth, Manowar and Coldplay
---
Errr a shit geared rogue is one of the worst classes to play in pvp imo.
---
If you say so dear.
---
Maybe, it had a very unique icon but that was half of what made it funny. Just some noob who doesn't know that he just randomly got one of the best items
---
Yeah this.  Personally I’d rather do 10 mins of real work to pay for my wow month than several hours of bfa farming which would be better spent farming in classic.

---
A polymorph doesn't cost a lot of mana. A mage will usually have enough mana to cast one, and if he doesn't, he can simply use a mana gem if things suddenly get bad and require his attention.
---
Also, a mage will usually drink between every single pull, as soon as they exit combat. It's annoying as a mage too when the tank begins waiting for you to finish drinking when you got 25% mana left and can start casting immediately. THAT'S wasted time.
---
Unless the mage is COMPLETELY out of mana, AND the pull requires polymorph, don't wait for the mage. Even if the mage only got enough mana to cast one polymorph, it'll probably be fine. Then the mage can cast that polymorph, and then use evocation to join the fight later.
---
You are one of the Races/Classes in a massive sandbox world. You are an adventurer, you find what to do for yourself. The reason for this is the immense amount of tools provided to you. Heavy reliance on RPG elements that are imbalanced, provide immersion in which there is always something you can use, whether item or party to turn that imbalance to balance.
---
Retail ran away from this in an attempt to make everyone happy and bring balance. Balance kills immersion, it kills the RBG aspect, and it eventually removes what i call the "Middleground". 
---
Games like TES, Dark souls, etc are loved for a reason. It's a massive world with tools, the rest it up to you. Blizzard of old managed to do that in a MMORPG, the ultimate game to please both casuals and hardcore. That is however no longer the case IMO.
---
Narf!
---
You can shield the tank in dungeons, and if not you can shield before the pull.
---
No bro not still, he has enough money for the rest of his life, and not in a let's live low and I'm okay fashion, in a let's fucking do whatever I want for the rest of my life fashion.
---
Have her a roll a druid. If she doesn't want to PvP, then stealthily around works.
---
And barons undead mount but not other undead mounts
---
The first Horde thots
---
 Back when there were 69 days left,  pepperidge farm remembers
---
I feel like the freaking out is more common in retail since levelling can be done mostly by just dungeons. That 1 pull could've been the last one of hundreds the poor guy could handle because it happens pretty much every group, multiple times, sometimes resulting in wipes.
---
Classic dungeons definitely require more group building, commitment, and more waiting in between pulls for mana, etc. compared to retail. So that should make everybody chill a bit. Combined with the time-gate until you can do dungeons, I really hope the community is a shimmer of what it once was back in the vanilla days.

The new Samsungs like RU7300 have 11ms Input Lag, thats absolutely fine for rpgs.

You can see a input lag ranking and good reviews about tvs at [rtings](https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/inputs/input-lag)
---
No.  100k USD is not that much money.
---
Relax there buddy. If you aren't his personal banker you don't know how much money he has and how he can spend it. I am just saying its weird for older people who made the company to just leave out of nowhere. They created Blizzard, its their child. And now they just go. Its weird. Doesn't mean I am right tho.
---
I am STILL pondering between Orc and Tauren.
---
Will of the Forsaken have limited use, and tbh, any tank worth it's money is going to stance dance. Troll's Berserking is quite powerful, on paper, but with spell batching, you can get a crit heal on you and you are basically waste it. Or you get a string of Parry-Hasted hits, and one or two can CRIT you, because, well...you can get only block 2 attacks in 5 seconds, and you might get hit 3 or even 4 times in 5 seconds , especially if you have WF totem proc while Berserking is up.
---
So, it's rather hard to time your Berserking or you are open to CRITS, which isn't something to ignore.
---
Like WotF, Berserking is situational and limited in use, while also being risky to use.
---
I will exclude Thunderfury from the equation, simply because you can be whatever race, once you got TF, you are a threat God.
---
But, very few tanks will get TF on your realm, and the chances to be one are slim. You can't choose your race based on TF...because any race is fine with TF.
---
However, since there are 99.99% chances NOT to get TF, and WotF and Berserking are really situational, you have to consider racials that are PERMANENT. And there are basically only 2 worth mentioning (SR and NR are laughable racials) : The 5% HP for Taurens and +5 Axe Skill for Orcs.
---
I tend to give Orcs the upper hand between the two racials. An Orc tank with an Axe is both better in threat AND survivability than a Tauren. You land more hits, you get less parried by the boss, so you threat will be higher and receive less parry-hasted hits from the boss, which decrease your damage taken.
---
One important part in the game is FARMING. Orcs farming power with 2 hand axes and Blood fury is MILES better than a Tauren with...Warstomp and 5% HP. If a guild have 2 equally time commitment tanks that compete for MT position...the one that can support itself with consumables and repairs will take the spot.
---
However, Taurens have a HUGE fucking advantage over ALL other races : the melee range. Taunt is based on melee range. All threat abilities are also based on melee range. In raids and dungeons, this advantage is HUGE, for those "Oh, shit!" moments, when a mobs, that AoE stuns, or damage or silence, starts running to a ranged DPS that is most likely close to some healers. 2 additional yards in range makes it easier for a Tauren to snap aggro or taunt, much faster than any other race.
---
It is a limited use, and tbh, you should not lose aggro...but it does happen, quite often, for various reasons.
---
One thing that Orc Warriors have above other Horde races is, again, based on their Axe skill : they are best Off tank among the Horde, because with Axes, when they are not needed to tank, they pull off much more damage than Undead, Taurens and Trolls.
---
At this moment, my choice is basically this : should I choose Tauren for melee range (snap aggro, taunt range) and 5% HP and lose the farming advantage, or should I use Orc for higher threat and survivability and farming power?
---
Both races are much better looking than Undead and Trolls. A T2 geared Orc or Tauren looks AWESOME compared to Undead and Trolls. They have permanent and relevant racials, 5% HP and Axe Skill. 
---
What will be the DECISIVE FACTOR , for me, is PvP, both WPvP and BGs, because I will roll on a PvP realm. And Orcs have a CLEAR advantage over Taurens : the Stun and Charm resist. Sure, Warriors are crap in WPvP, but Orcs are the kings.
---
And another small thing to consider, is that Orc Stun and CHARM resists is fucking OP in 5 men dungeons. It is PERMANENT, and even if it doesn't really matter, it adds up.
---
But, on the other side, you got Tauren's Warstomp, which is fucking amazing in 5 men runs.
---
I will probably flip a fucking COIN on August 13th, when character name reserve is up, to choose between Orc and Tauren.
---
If she tries PvP and hates it, reroll on a PvE server.
---
Right exactly.  I think the people answering yes are children that don’t really know the value of money yet.  100k really isn’t that much - if it was a mill or more I’d consider it.
---
Now if only video game companies made games instead of doing business.
---
Omg .. i hope i will never have to play with people like you ... youre the most selfish assface ever .. geez
---
... Blizzard doesn't exist. They sold it. It's not weird at all, how the fuck is it weird to decide to stop what you have been doing for 28 years??? Are you really this dense?????
---
If you assume it's DKP, maybe the reliable raider spent their DKP on other BiS stuff and now the flakey one has saved up more than they have. Or maybe it's EPGP and the flake has fewer items from the tier, or maybe it is Suicide Kings and the flake is higher on the list.
---
Either way, it's naive verging on wilfully obtuse to think that 100% of the time the better raider will have more points or whatever.
---
That comparison video was hilarious. It's basically "Look, WoW is 3D and looks cooler". Which, thinking back, makes sense. WoW was one of the more impressive looking MMOs at the time, with Runescape and EQ1 still being big, one of the MMOs that would be able to keep up is FFXI I reckon.
---
---------------------------
---
The fact that you actually found a girlfriend through WoW after that is pretty amazing. You came up with that whole pregnancy thing at 12 years old for gold and didn't get anything, that's karma at work I guess!
---
Have you told your GF about that at all? If so, does she think it's hilarious?
---
I’m doing pally/warrior duo levelling 100% with a friend so no not really.  Imo it’s only solo levelling that gets boring, duo with some classes that synergies well is always fun even when grinding.
---
During TBC got laid off from my construction job and was given a decent severance package. With the exception of one vacation, and Sunday morning family obligations, I was playing from 9am - 1/2am daily
---
After I got divorced, end of 2010, I started playing RIFT. It was fuckin glorious. I lived in a share house (after moving out of my house, which we ended up selling) and my housemates were fuckin cool and kept to themselves. I had a great job (worked as a croupier) and all my money and time was my own. Get home at 4am after night shift? Gaming. Got an RDO? Gaming. Saturday night and my mates are out on the town drinking? Gaming.
---
I was 34 years old. Good times.
---
Now I’m remarried and got two kids and I love my wife and my life is pretty fuckin good, with an even better job (train driver) and we don’t want for anything financially but boy do I love to reminisce about those days of careless selfishness.
---
It's also BiS for Frost mage along with the exalted AV off hand.
---
Take me to the land, that you understand
---
Hmmmm highest I can go is 60%. That’s my final offer.
---
“I’m reducing the damage on the tank”
---
No your stealing my rage and thus my threat and burning healer mana on a “””””tank””””” that requires more healing per mob than I do!
---
I came from Ragnarök Online where the classes were also professions; Blacksmith was an actually playable class and had stats surrounding its crafting prowess etc.
---
I had already played and loved Warcraft 3 and Disblo 2 a bit, especially custom maps, so I knew where all the spells came from, but I always thought the less typical MMO classes stood out. Warcraft lore *is* a bit specific when it comes to demons, so I'll have to go with Warlock.
---
Sure there are pet summoner casters in other MMOs, but which of them summons the demons you'd normally fight, and lorewise controls them against their will? So cool. You have all those dark magics at your disposal as well as crippling damage over time spells.
---
Casters aren't unique, neither are dark casters or anything alike, but coming from RO where the only real casters at the time were your elemental Wizard or the move-while-casting utility Sage, seeing Warlocks was neat as hell.
---
Shoutouts to Shamans as well, natural-elemental melee attackers and casters are awesome and I think their design was solid as hell. Always wished Blizz stuck to 2H being Enhancers thing for TBC and onward, having that big, meaty Windfury weapon hit and crit is satisfying as hell.
---
Only 3 hrs in molten core?
---
One comes to mind was my Orc warrior, I was doing the lvl 30 quest for my wirlwind axe so I had to kill that Elite water elemental. Me being a complete noob because I was new to this game and it was my first character, I didn't understand what the dragon portrait on it was so I was having a difficult time killing it being a level 33. 
---
On my 3rd time respawning I was standing there helpless as I see this last boss is right there and then came strolling a Draenei 40ish ? (can't remember specificly) female warrior. I was scared seeing that red text level enemy and 180 started running. But the Draenei caught up to me and communicated with me using emotes like /stop and /e saying "don't be scared". I was blown away that you could interact with players this way and she decided to help me kill the mob.
---
So we downed the boss with ease and I was happy and thanked the draenei a million times. Looking back I think she helped me because she knew exactly what I was going through so I really appreaciate her help and started helping opposite factions more ever since.
---
Will never forget that spot in Hillsbrad. :)
---
Can't wait for stuff like this to happen in Classic!!
---
p3 not even close
---
I think she's supposed to be levitating?
---
Yes, tanking is in my opinion the most fun role in PvE and I'll tell you why I think so.
---
Unlike any other role tanking is actually about managing people and 90% of it is non-verbal. You form a group, exchange pleasantries to establish a good vibe among everyone and head to the instance. You zone in and inspect people as they trickle in to get an idea of how geared the group is and possibly look for indicators that someone's a newbie and you need to make accommodations in your playstyle.
---
Usually within the first minute or two of the initial pull you get a solid idea of what kind of dungeon run this will be based on how your group is doing and you automatically adjust your playstyle to accommodate for the group.

Usually I look for specific things in DPS and healers so that I can try to make up for what our group lacks. You can't always have perfect threat on every mob in classic and there's bound to be loose mobs, depending on how the DPS reacts I know that I might need to change my playstyle for the rest of the dungeon if I notice for example that the DPS aren't always careful to CC mobs, or maybe they're not the quickest to peel mobs off the healer or maybe even don't do it at all.
---
Stuff like that is what makes the tanking role fun because it forces you to change up your playstyle and it makes dungeon runs with a new group feel fresh because you're dealing with a new person, a new set of variables, a new set of strengths and weaknesses etc. And that's just what I find to be the fun aspect of pugging as a tank.
---
Grouping with your guild might be a totally different experience, especially if they're hardcore raiders it can be a lot of fun in my opinion. The whole dungeon meta changes in a group like that because everybody's trying to optimize the run and you notice players making subtle changes to their playstyles from one run to the next.
---
Personally I don't find raid tanking to be nearly as fun as 5/10 man tanking at least in the beginning. Raid tanking mostly boils down to 'run over there and tank the mob away from the raid'. In my experience it takes a long time before a guild becomes comfortable enough with each other that they dare to break free from that sort of tried and tested safe playstyle. Once players become more confident and you start taking risks raid tanking becomes a lot more fun.
---
If we’re talking min / maxing - abstinence is the true BiS, it optimizes your playtime and there is no slight chance of reversal like vasectomy. 
---
Casuals will tell you Vasectomy is fine and you’ll still get invited to raids, but you’ll never go truly hardcore if you don’t min / max.
---
Yes because 5 mages is the normal in dungeon groups.
---
Yes but the mage has to be there to cast it. If he has to run to poly then he cant drink and wont have mana for damage, if he sits and loads up mana the tank takes more damage because the mobs aren't CC'd. It's better to med your group up high then roll over multiple packs efficiently so you dont have the healer going oom from lack of cc/dps.
---
By keeping the group together they do things more efficiently. The tank is kept alive for less mana. The tank doesn't lose any threat on the mobs so the healer can spend less time healing giving her more mana, the dps can kill faster giving everyone more time to recover and everything dying faster, which in turn keeps the warrior at a higher threat and so on.
---
Leaving people to catch up slows you down over all.
---
No, I was just terrible at explaining. Your opinion is perfectly fine. I was a little shocked at the people acting like 100k is shit. That's what I was saying is snobbery. I'm also very well off financially actually, but I worked hard to get here and know the value of 100k. To act like it's shit, and say the people who would take the money are "poor", is pathetic.
---
Oh yeah, for sure.  I just love having it, to be honest.
---
Io score is king baby!
---
100% agree. I also hate titanforging never making a drop feel satisfying.  Someone offspec rolls a better version just to vendor it. Its consumerism.
---
Perfect time to introduce the kids to the game. My girls are 3 and they live watching the monster game (what they call it)
---
Couldn’t relate more. Then you randomly run onto additional ud rogue scums and you become a pack and decide to creep around brd. Dat adrenaline.
---
While I'm for any argument that goes against paladins obtaining this wep (alliance caster here) ill say that crit is really good for paladins because of their talents. They get 100% mana back if it's a crit i think.
---
you have to look into why people funnel gear to a tank. those practice came from times where you where stuck on a boss for weeks. 
---
nowadays with all the info on pre raid/phase bis even the tanks can get geared enough outside of raids to be capable of taking the corresponding raid.
---
and once you killed a boss there is no need to upgrade gear (doesn't mean you shouldn't)
---
so if for example you get to ragnaros in your first id the tank items where sufficient and you can just split it between mt/ot/3rd without worrying.
---
it will only be necessary to funnel gear to the mt in aq40/naxx and by then you should be confident enough that your maintank you played with the last 2yeats wont just switch guilds.
---
if you got a tank who demands to be geared first, even though its not necessary, you can be sure he will be a problem anyway at some point.
---
sure give your mt the first shield/weapon but dont shove everything up his ass if its not necessary
---
While sort of oldschool, it's still "modern" enough to not be annoying. I played a ton of Ragnarök Online back when there weren't even revival classes, so maxlevel was 99.
---
Getting that required an insane amount of time and dying once meant losing a hefty chunk of EXP as well as being ported to your bound city. No graveyard, back to Prontera or Payon you go!
---
In comparison, WoW is way more cozy. It also has fun as hell gameplay, which is one thing I'll always value WoW highly for; the engine feels *just* right. Even modern MMOs can feel janky in comparison (ESO's combat feels horrible, FFXIV is janky in so many ways, shoutouts to GW2 though, that game controls like butter). Small things like fences having 3D polygons so you can jump on them and stuff is your typical Blizzard polish which I often miss in other games.
---
Then it's your typical stuff: The community and your reputation matter a *lot*, classes are unique from another(although TBC did that better IMO), 40 man raids are huge and epic storms of spells and weaponswings which just look *awesome*, PVP isn't focused on arena (I love objective based PVP in all games I play, deathmatch annoys me) and world PVP will actually be a thing for a while.
---
Gold matters a lot and can buy you a lot of power, but getting it is fair yet tough. No dailies or weeklies, the only "weekly" is raiding and the only "daily" are a handful of minor things like crafting. If you wanna progress your character once you log in, you *can*. If you don't, you won't miss out on some arbitrary FOMO abusing bullshit mechanic of badges, points or something else that keeps you logging in.
---
The world is huge and actually *feels* huge; traveling is a big thing and enemies are actually dangerous. If you pull many foes you better have a plan on how to deal with them; whereas in BFA as a discpriestt I can pull 12+ mobs, shield myself and AoE them down. I feel like an omnipotent demigod and it sucks.
---
Leveling in itself is *part of the game*. Every step of the way feels satisfying; the devs went through many iterations on how to keep it feeling that way with skill systems of various kinds during alpha, and the final talent points coupled with skills you learn from vendors, gear upgrades and key-levels where you learn a TON of cool stuff feel *awesome*. Reaching Level 10, 20, 30 and 40 all feel very impactful, don't get me started on 60 of course. Leveling takes a while, too, which I'm absolutely fine with. Buying a maxlevel character is just boring as hell.
---
I love seeing my RPG character grow, become stronger, more versatile, better at traveling, managing bag space...Every little mechanic that exists in Vanilla gets better and better the longer you play. Sure, that means low level "feels bad" in comparison, but that's for the effect of growth. In BFA you stop gaining new spells at 80 and new talent at, what, 110? And you only have a handful of them anyway.
---
I love how many weird and niche spells there are. Fire spell ward or whatever it's called from mages e.g may seem very situational, but whenever you fight a fire elemental, or in PVP a warlock, fire mage or elemental shaman you'll be glad to have it. I *love* that.
---
-----------------------
---
Classic is awesome. It's not perfect, I'd prefer TBC's combat, class balance, raid and dungeon mechanics to Vanilla personally, but I'll still have an absolute blast, I know that for sure. I'll lead a guild, maintank and find friends for life.
---
There'll be drama, leveling will take forever as a warrior and god damnit, I can't wait to play my Warrior, my Shaman PVP alt and have a ton of fun in Azeroth once more.
---
Have a nice day people.
---
Yeah!  I'll work on something :)
---
I agree with this. I don't have a problem if e.g. the priest healer wants shadow gear, too. I have heard people say that you should only roll on stuff that goes with the role you're filling at the moment, but it seems stupid. If the tank and the healer are willing to take one for the team and run you through the dungeon, they certainly shouldn't be penalized for that.
---
It's hard to remember, but I think this was the majority take on it back in the day, too. I think there's just a couple of greedy dps on this sub spreading misinformation. :)
---
I’m building a low key, meme spec allowed, not hardcore, raiding guild. (You don’t have to raid tho) 
---
We have a decent group already going and plan to pick up more in game. But if you’re interested in hanging out with a group of grumpy old men who talk shit and have a penchant for dark humor (and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia references) simply reply to this message and I’ll get you the details.
---
Your parents must be proud when they see how you talk to other people. You can't have a normal conversation and aren't open to other peoples opinion, instead you think you are always right and bash others with slurs that are really offensive. Hope one day you will see what kind of a person you are, and maybe then you will try to change that. Wish you all the best in life. Have a good one.
---
&gt; On pservers it's also random.
---
It was not random on any of those I played on, and I played on quite a few.
---
&gt; So don't use fear unless you absolutely have to.
---
I played Vanilla, and if you have a competent Warlock, and a group that supports him, it's absolutely viable. Of course you have to clear more than the bare minimum of mob packs, but then, I heartily dislike this "just the bare minimum" approach anyhow, because more often than not, someone who's not running *exactly* the line you need to will add a group, and then it's usually a wipe.
---
My point merely is: If all you have is a Warlock for CC, you *can* use fear as CC if you plan accordingly: Give him space to play around in, and he can both mezz a mob with his Succubus, and keep one feared; If a mob threatens to run in the direction of a mob pack, stop him with a CoR.
---
Phase 2's diremaul has great gear, once that rolls around you can grab decent starting stuff. Until then, you can still grab preraid BiS. OrcBit is a great ressouce for that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bmoyz2TkAk
---
You can grab a lot of decent gear from just running UBRS, LBRS and BRD. Once PVP rewards roll around you can buy the blue PVP stuff fairly quickly, rank 8 nets you a lot of good stuff already.
---
Did 3 dungeons on a pserver, to test it out. Was full rush, no talking and no real problems. Pservers are even tuned garder than true vanilla. Dungeons will be a breeze in classic.
---
Not really imo. Vanilla rogue is very slow, no shadowstep and no cloak of shadow. Spells like hunter's mark or faerie fire ruin your day. If your goal is to wander stealthed all day you really want to wait for burning crusade :D
---
Me except 4am every day.  Send help.
---
If anything, stun resist is underrated.
---
tfw ywn have a qt orc gf to pin you down and ride you into the afterlife
---
Holy shit I just laughed out loud reading this. Great story!
---
IMAGINE THE SMELL
---
Silent alarm?  Vibration?
---
Input and display lag aren't that bad unless you're playing a shooter. RPGs aren't affected as much because don't need the precision of clicking. You can always rig up some USB extender cables and use a wired setup to alleviate it. They're pretty cheap on Amazon. 
---
If you're used to 144hz 120+ FPS, though, you're definitely going to feel the difference.
---
how are you alive
---
Female can be cutie and they dance like Irish which is awesome if you can find 20 more female dwarves to make a line with them.
---
Just adding on to your first point, assign different marks to different cc’s/classes so you dont have to manually call out who cc’s what every pull. Saves time and reduces: ”i thought the mage was gonna sheep”
---
The olllll’ ball-n-chain.
---
Anyone that speed lvl will be able to play on a pvp server with almost no world pvp while lvling (since people that lvl fast won't run into so many people and those people want to lvl quickly).
---
Anyone that play casually will be doing a lot of world pvp. People that are 5-10 levels above go through zones again sometimes (example in STV you can go into it around lvl 30 but some of the latest quests are lvl 45). So many fights that are not even winnable.
---
Some zones will likely be taken over by 1 faction (like pirates in tanaris will probably be controlled by the faction with most players or the faction that have high llv players there).
---
In phase 2 everyone will kill anyone they can on sight.
---
Possible to level in just dungeons, but that would be boring and slow xp without a full group doing it for hours nonstop.
---
Dont die
---
We had a tauren shaman in our guild who whiped the Raid in mc pulling adds. His punishment was to run around the "crater" in ironforge three times. A big chunk of allies and horde gathered in ironforge. The allies where allowed to stun, sap, blind him.... but not to kill him. Only one rogue killed him several times, after a few times the horde took care of him. Hundreds of people watched "peacefull" his punishment and honoerd the truce.
---
Ill explain it like this.. You have 30 abilities worth using in this fight. The right racial can give you the 31st spell.. If you Are min maxing, then obviously you want that 31st ability, but sacrificing the enjoyment of the right starting zone and the right animations can be a downgrade in enjoyability. So play what you want really also meens play what you like looking at.. If the gnome gauge animation annoys you and the dwarf one satisfy you, having 20 days played is a lot of missed satisfaction.
---
Same man, one night a week
---
Well even with transmog thatd still be the Case Just because there arent that many cool Sets Out there.
---
Hahaha to be fair when she was drunk that’s what she wanted. Mostly vodka drunk.
---
My favorite was people after they got reported gms wouldn't give item the worst one that got me was a mount. Super low drop rate ran that raid on about ten alts a week (I had a problem) saw it once entire expansion. 
---
Leader snagged it after losing roll so it was actually guild run guy was willing to get kicked from guild for it. But best part was heard him whining in trade about blizzard removing his mount. They didn't transfer or anything just made sure the guy didn't gain from it.
---
And most group setups can easily survive massive ninja pulls just by using defensive spells and cds, like kiting them with frost nova / aoe  slows. Just having a competent tank isn't enough, but it helps. As long as the dps are competent you will most likely survive 3-4x pulls.
---
53 here. Counting the days until I can get into the game again and say hello to all the NPCs.
---
Attunement BRD runs were so Long, i Loved it!
---
Enhancement, Retri and Boomkins always stood out for me; always wanted to play a geared one but will never happen. Probably because you have to be an guild master in order to roll it :P
---
1. Oil hinges on door so they don’t creak
---
2. Leave door cracked so handle won’t make noise
---
3. Grab corner of blanket and ease it over you as you ease torso onto pillow like you’re already laying down just at an awkward angle 
---
4. Pretend to shuffle and bring legs under blanket. Pause every few seconds and reshuffle, make “asleep person” random sounds at your discretion (if she’s already complained you’re a snorer or smack your lips in your sleep etc)
---
5. If she asks “What in the hell are you doing?” act like she just woke you up and make a few nonsensical grumbles and continue the shuffling til you’re comfortable
---
I grudgingly upvote the gnome
---
Taking is fun for the most part, the bad part is leveling a warrior is brutal. I never got to MT status but did some MC raids and got a few drops from there. You have to switch to prot eventually which sucks for pvp
---
Greedy af
---
Healing isn't a problem while progressing through MC. Damage is the main bottleneck. Therefore, while this *is* a paladin wep, it is also a caster wep and should be going to top casters before paladins.
---
Name of the addon? :o
---
Same me and a few buddies will do this. Flood The AH!!
---
Did she bring you hot pockets and a bucket to shit in?
---
Atleast you're horde, so i can come fuck you on my mage haha
---
Wholesome advice!
---
I never had one drop in over 30 days played =(
---
Yeh, because being considerate of her sleep patterns and wellbeing is for pussies.
---
Social life must have been like in the movies!
---
This. After having played with a lot of really bad hunters, there was this one who really was able to play his class. Especially always having an eye on me, the priest, in an otherwise underwhelming group, that would have let me get killed again and again (and the whole group), if not for ice traps and tanking pet and a hunter taking hits for me until the tank finally got the mobs back. Made me realize that the hunter class was way more than just a damage dealer, and that I would need to step up my game with my hunter twink.
---
Is there an alliance flight path in Tristal Glades? I wanna level in SM on a pvp server.
---
Gnome
---
15 had my job at the pizza shop and played WoW and also went to hs lol
---
I tried last expansion to start a weekend AM guild  Mythic + Friday night for gear,  6 AM Saturday and Sunday for raids. received literally zero interest. Although that might be due to the complete disinterest in bfa.
---
If you're running Stratholme in blues and greens, you WILL need crowd control.
---
[It gets better](https://youtu.be/U4Rl83wK1VE)
---
The best thing to do is to have the pet stay via macro/hotkey then jump down and when he disappears you just whistle back.
---
Doesnt work everywhere of course dependng on distance traveled.
---
rogue has probably the best gear out of MC possible besides maybe hunter
---
I am going to have to research again also as I am in the same boat, I only happen to remember that specific detail due to having.... issues with a couple particular mages while I was first gearing up my warrior alt :P
---
And many playing a different class all together.
---
I disagree with a lot of this. My response will assume you're in a pug, as the post states that this is what it's about.
---
Pulling: your tank is completely irrelevant here - look at healer mana and positioning, if the healer mana is fine, go ahead and pull. If the tank is slow, then you have to set the tempo yourself if you want to get out of there before christmas. The vast majority of pulls are easily manageable without a tank at all in dungeons. In raids, hunters do a lot of pulling, don't for a second imagine that pulling is a tank-only privilege. If anything it's a healer privilege which the healer so graciously hands out to those who understand what a healer needs to be ready. 
---
"Focus marked targets": Only if you are completely clueless. If you know which mob in a pack that is actually dangerous, ignore all marks and go for that mob. Most mobs will do just about nothing, and if you follow the marks of an incompetent leader it really doesnt matter if the marked mobs die quickly, because that still means the actual threat in a pack will be able to deal that much more damage. If you're in luck, you have at least one more player in your party with a shred of competence that will help you with killing the mobs that are actually a danger to the party. 
---
"Don't switch off early": I kind of agree, but AoE is very often king in dungeons, just make sure to keep track of what the lowest mob is up to.
---
"Watch your threat": No, really, don't. This isn't heroic TBC where two hits from an elite will turn you into tzatsiki. You have several thousand hp and a mob will deal around 2-300 damage per hit to you. In addition to this, the mob you just aggroed will be dead within seconds. There are certain mobs that can cause pushback or webs/stuns where you will benefit from just not having it on you, but never be afraid of a hit or two. However, I do agree with OP about running to the tank, always make sure your tin can is in range of whatever you have on you. The exception is when you consider yourself able to solo the rest of the hp of the mob, which often is the case.
---
Enemy castbar and dismissing pets: god yes, the two biggest killers. If there are two things you should take away from this thread it's these two.
---
Stay behind the tank: Only if you're clueless. The tank can make exactly the same fuckup. If you know the next pull is tricky, better to do it yourself than watch the tank fuck it up. Tanks are just as likely to be bad as everyone else.
---
CC: Don't. The exception is when an asspull occurs and control is needed to remedy the situation. CCing a dangerous mob adds a risk to the fight that this dangerous mob might break loose from said CC and start unleashing havoc. It is much safer to nuke the dangerous mobs. Harmless mobs are better off being AoEd down or left for last than being CCed, they pose no threat to the party.
---
Dont kill your healer: I wholeheartedly agree. Frost nova mostly causes a lot of damage to people who didnt need to be taking it. Most of the time it's fine since mobs dont hit that hard, but tjere are moments when you will cause a oneshot slam on either your healer or another caster standing by the mobs. Don't use it in pugs, period.
---
If your eyeballs are not dried out stuck to your monitor while playing, u wont get the full vanilla experience.
---
This sounds like a painfully slow run tbh.
---
So you are saying that undead humans look more human than not-humans? Heureka!
---
I wont run a single instance without reserving that sweet bis piece every time, unless there is a sick disproportion of tanks at 60 this time around.
---
• Don’t die
---
• If you are a ranged DPS - always switch to a high threat mob (maybe running away into other pack, running towards healer you can CC, pull threat and save the healer etc)
---
• If you got DoT spells/abilities, use them wisely (if a mob is going down in 6-10 sec, no use putting DoTs) 
---
• Just because you are not tank or healer - someone is asking you for specifik tasks - doesn’t mean you cant save the day. Healer catching threat from a caster mob? Kick, gauge, silence, CC it - You will find yourself enjoing the dungeons much more and in Classic, unline retail - players will remember and notice you.
---
Last but not least
---
• Be humble - micromanage a player that has little or no experience rather than calling them a retard, they will most likely love you forever and always help you when the time comes for you to ask a favor
---
Have a nice day Ladies and Gents
---
Paladin. I want to be self sufficient and do crazy aoe farming/grinding in the later levels
---
But before he will take a shower to wash off the retail.
---
My ears are bleeding from that garbage music
---
Well, why should we pretend, if it is still 2004?
---
How to be a good mage in dungeons:
---
Ignore all this shit and AOE
---
So people who no life farming gold win their items every time ?
---
Well I'm glad you let me know, because I was way off-base in regards to the taunt mechanic.
---
Didn’t have to plan it. Was in college so had plenty of time to no life game. 
---
Now I’ve got other more important shit going on. The memories are great but I’m not in a rush to do the same when Classic comes. Different priorities now.
---
Oh the irony
---
I also really dislike their one handed animations with maces and axes. They usually stab. Ever stabbed with a hatchet?
---
Great advice: just do whatever
---
There aren't Draenei rogues either
---
Which loot system is the best depends on your guild and what you want from said guild.
---
[I will use EP/GP for mine](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/EPGP); basically DKP with a few logical additions, most notably decay so that new players can actually get something for once and older players feel the need to buy non-BiS items every now and then.
---
There used to be addons for this, so it was also 100% transparent and not managed by some corrupt GM who gives himself 100000 DKP out of nowhere, so that's something I wish to impose as well. There will be exceptions for exceptional gear, such as Class-specific quest items (Petrified leaf and Eye of Shadow), Thunderfury (Goes to the MT), and Tier sets, as well as "logic" rules; if someone plays shadow e.g they'll have main need on Shadow gear. If they play heal they'll have main need on heal gear. If no one needs something for main loot, second loot EP/GP rolls are allowed; if no one then needs it, it gets DE'd.
---
Additional points can be earned for giving out consumables/farming stuff for other guildies (*not* just the officers or MT).
---
I hope this will provide a fair yet still somewhat progression oriented result. If anyone has criticisms for that, I'm all ears, I'm still on the fence but this system has found acceptance amongst our guild so far. Never used it until now so if anyone has any tips or recommendations, again: I'm all ears.
---
Hopefully all the things be OP listed are still required. I would be sad if dungeons really were faceroll easy like the reports out of beta suggest.
---
I had the same problem. I was one of the best 5 man tanks in our faction and had pre-raid BiS, but I could never secure a tanking spot. I had no interest in DPSing so I didn't accept those spots.
---
This time around I may have to just DPS as a warrior in raids until a raid tank spot opens up in the guild, and transition across.
---
How is this a real thread?
---
I responded to every single comment that I saw in my inbox.
---
What you smoking?
---
You've got loads of fun 5 man's to run.
---
BRD, Scholomance, Stratholme, Dire Maul, UBRS, LBRS.
---
You can start collecting all the instance keys and collecting your Blue set with the bonuses if you want them.
---
Running the Ony quest lines.
---
What a stange think to say!
---
I see you are the man of my culture
---
Yeah it’s usually tough to become a main tank for several reasons...usually the MT is a guild leader, knows all the fights and how to move he bosses as needed. Maybe now that info is easily accessible but still had to watch a video and know what to do in game, at least back then. Even as an Off tank you can get pretty solid tanking gear if you put in your time at the raids
---
I don’t see blame the healer anywhere, I’m sure that needs to be included.
---
Yes, and increases attack power of the target, iirc.
---
Depends if your the type that’s okay not making progress for a night to go help your friends. I had a friend that leveled past me to 60 before me and he was always a little bitch if I ever asked for help needless to say that’s when I learned some people only care about themselves not helping their friends.
---
My alliance party quested together with a horde party inside the caves in Jintha'Alor. 
---
All the mobs were taken down quickly and we happily went our separate ways :)
---
To balance that off with an tale of animosity:
---
While questing in the caves outside Uldaman, we met a horde party and just stood and looked at them for a few moments, unsure what to do. 
---
Eventually, someone in our party decided to shoot first.
---
We proceeded to get killed, run back to Uldaman as ghosts, then get killed again by the other party or the elite mobs in the caves.
---
This lasted about half an hour until everyone finally managed to get into the instance.
---
Haha, thanks! :)
---
I never understood why people did that, I always loved the starting zone for undead, and all the plague themed zones that I got taken to.
---
Then I became edgy and started doing it to look like the pro kids
---
I'll specifically go to Barrens with my undead, I wouldn't want to feel the seclusion in Silverpine (however great that area is), I could only think about all the shebang I miss in the barrens chat and seeing all those players running around.
---
This will be my tribute to the classic feel.
---
Will definetly level is Silverpine the second time around.
---
Nothing manlier than banging a female orc imo
---
“But this is how we do it in Retail...” Tanks in Classic.
---
This writeup is the sum of my experience tanking in vanilla/tbc/wotlk and most recently pservers.
---
And they keep doing that fucking laugh
---
I don't have any 'evidence' or memories of my vanilla raiding, but after 6 months of ND raiding it seems like trash drops are ALOT more frequent than vanilla. eg
---
multiple boots of pure throughts in one run, draconic mauls, the Naxx mace etc
---
I swapped from a 60hz tv to a 144hz monitor and it’s a massive difference for dps, interrupts, and PvP
---
So true
---
Yooo what are the rules?
---
Lmfao so much saltiness out of nowhere from Soultrane 😂😂😂
---
Just give me the details you goddamn bitch.
---
Basic item to add, imo. Turn mobs away from healer/dps, so AoE cone effects do not hit the rest of the party. Once the tank has aggro, they should position themselves so that the pack of mobs have their backs to the group as they turn to face the tank.
---
Nope just a lucky friend of a friend situation. Was back stage at a show
---
Troll fems are kinda nice after model update. Also doesn't mind the foot fetish.
---
I've been playing on a 55" LG OLED since November (I had quit gaming after AQ in vanilla and my PC is mostly used as a media PC).
---
I just noticed that there's some screenburn from both playing in windowed mode (so the top of the game window and 'world of warcraft' is visible) and the minimap buttons are visible.  
---
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
---
I think you’re vastly underestimating the volume of players that will be in the same zone now and the percentage of which that will be rogues. There are very few reasons to role a rogue and ganking is the biggest one on pvp servers.
---
I’m not saying your experience isn’t valid it’s just different from mine. Some of the most fun leveling memories come from ganking people on my rogue from way back in the day. I doubt I’m alone in this.
---
Why would that kid say "Now I'm going to kill you all" when he knew they were making a video critical of his gaming addiction?
---
What is up with their doorways? It looks like the doors were torn out forcibly.

God, her teeth.
---
All good and well, but then he doesn't get to enjoy the game the same if he's not on a PVP server.
---
You are not the first person here spewing bullshit because of some shit info from random youtubers. But anytime mate, i love proving people wrong and ill gladly do it again :)
---
Focus target/Pulling:
---
Its fine if your pugs work like that and you speed through the dungeons even with ignoring your tank. But I would not assume that this is the norm for pugs on a fresh servers. In my experience the result of a behaviour as described by you leads to longer dungeon runs because of drama and/or wipes of the group. So you will spend more time in the dungeon and you make sure that everybody has a bad time including yourself.
---
Yeah, everyone is talking about the "gear" instead of the actual subject being OPs handiwork. Details?
---
Thank you! and I've just dropped you a message with the info :)
---
Note to new tanks, don't be intimidated by this post. It's sounds like a lot but it's really not all that difficult. A few dungeons in and you'll have the hang of it.
---
Somewhere around late teens early twenties, no?
---
I would highly recommend a Druid or perhaps Paladin (Bubble Hearth). Something that has a solid escape mechanism.
---
Holy fuck there's 120 levels now?
---
On lh we had 1 tear a week in both raids, we ended up giving paladins tear...
---
Tanking in vanilla is pretty simple once you learn how to do it.
---
&gt;Mark the mobs that need to be CC
---
&gt;LoS the casters
---
&gt;Tab, sunder, repeat
---
That’s a pserver goggles comment.
---
Can’t get stunned by someone that is stun locked.
---
His mum
---
So, I have a guild member who wants to play prot pally at launch, and he mentioned that this is actually prot BiS. I kinda just laughed at that, since I couldn't see giving this to a prot pally before a mage, warlock, or holy pally.
---
Just because he was successful once doesn't mean he can do it again. The original Diablo people left to make a new studio. It released Hellgate London and then shut down after it failed
---
&gt; It's litterally BIS for healadins till BWL.
---
It's BiS for casters too. Neltharion's Tear is BiS for Boomkins as well but it doesn't mean you give it Boomie prio.
---
You wait to be invited.
---
BWL patch:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19360
---
Soft res weights loot distribution in favor of players who are actively seeking out an individual item while free roll gives equal chance to all players, regardless of how many items they need.
---
It allows a group to bring in new players to soak up the generic loot, without decreasing the geared players chances of losing specific items to players who likely are pulling far less weight.
---
The system can be gamed, but is still better than free roll in every way.
---
Why should you be sorry? So what if 38% of the server is exactly the same as you? UD are great, rogues are great...you do you. 
---
You are all fodder to crush under boot,
---
Demo shout is better threat generation once you hit a certain number of mobs.
---
It’s more about 5 people killing a mob. But really at early levels mob fighting’s not the best idea because you will mostly likely die.
---
Wow you must have heard my first few days in the game lol 😂
---
Build a wall to stop tauren's invasion too ! It was made in Cataclysm hehe.
---
So bag rates are massively buffed and BoE items are moderately buffed. Expect for things to be much rarer than retail or private servers.
---
Mate.. Headmaster's Charge is shit
---
advice on how to be a pussy in your own home lmao
---
why are yall tip toeing around your wife/gf like you are a pre-teen
---
Raiders omegalulz imagine getting gratification out of fighting bots instead of real players.

PvP&gt;PvE forever.

Looking forward to seeing you all in the open world.

25:39 is this the spec you talking about? "Smite spec"  
---
He talks about it more in-depth 23:44 (to 25:39)
---
30% slower since hunters have aspect of the cheetah. So this method is a little more risky for warlocks.
---
&gt; listen to their shit
---
Haha
---
honestly, classic is go go go for good groups too
---
there will be a clash of styles at first but the adjustment is easy
---
Why is it in the 1.12 client, the very last version of the game, if they changed it "a patch after"? BC prepatch doesnt really count as the same game anymore.
---
This is such a fantastic post and exactly the type of guild I hope to find, I know theres a huge stigma that everyone should just relax, it's a game and not a job but the fact is there are 39 other people dedicating their time and resources to accomplishing a goal and all it takes is one or two people constantly late and unprepared but super big buddies with the GL/RL to tear the entire guild down.

Do you know anything about reading comprehension?
---
If most people could retire at that age you can bet that they would.
---
This is easily combatted by having max bids by rank, and withholding raider rankings from players who aren’t contributing.
---
How limited your time is? Only 12 hours per day is not enough. You should consider Twitch then.
---
As undead warlock I can usually tap to 15% between bandage and canabalize I can usually get full hp without the healers Mana.
---
Thanks !
---
Hopefully it happens to one of those streamers.
---
next time smash the door while entering to the bedroom. Jump over the bed and yell "I will kill this Bastard" (someone, doesnt matter). Trust me, your wife will pretend she is sleeping.

I love item drop quests. You get good experience, meat drops for cooking, and trash. I'm a big fan of the troll quests in STV for example.
---
Choose wich class to play :D
---
it would mean no house loan so yeah, I'll wait for classic BC no problem
---
Hunters level crazy fast, so you may very well have time for both. Start as a shaman, see how it goes. There will always be time for a hunter.
---
No, PVP servers are not that bad :)
---
Dragonscales are a thing so they should probably have more armor than Ragnaros for example who doesn't have any armor at all.
---
I think you'll be fine as long as you're having fun.
---
This one was the first raid video I ever saw, and it's a great one. Superb music selection, and showing every boss in the instance. The way it ends makes it feel more epic to me as well.
---
Brother has at least one DUI, for sure.

Win the lottery to be able to afford the ideal lifestyle.

Damn, that was epic. Thanks for sharing.
---
&gt;I mean it's pretty obvious that blizzard we know and love is fading and or gone.
---
That was true when Bill Roper left.
---
mechanics in retail are harder, that's a fact, it doesn't mean the game is more complex
---
seems like you never played classic then.
---
Skill Trees and that people actually run out of resources as opposed to retail.
---
Weird, on a few private servers when I rolled druid I had more bags than I could use before I left the starting zone. When I went human I couldn't even find one.
---

Found the Russians! :p

orc fem... fuck...

Lets base vanilla drop rates on 2 runs from 1-30
---
I had a job 15 years ago, and was in college, and still went to social events. If something is important to you, you make time. If it's not, that's *fine*. not everyone has to do everything. There are plenty of other things in this world to distract us from the inexorable march toward eternal stillness.
---
I was with you at first but fuck off with the layering bullshit, it's one phase to avoid not having a single mob tagged the entire first week. It's not all going to be pro players out there on day one, there will be new players too, that have to be retained if we want this to have any staying power. Not everyone will know how to instant tag and if they can't level up they'll quit immediately. Fact is, I'd much rather play with them than you whiny entitled little bitches
---
Yeah I was aware at the time that the video was intensely bias, but I didn't care. Moving in "true 3D" was the shit and I wanted to be a part of it. Can't say I ever played EverQuest!
---
Yep! And there's so many factors as well. If any one of them had been different (different server, stayed alliance, she hadn't been playing, etc), I wouldn't have moved country to be with her. Kinda strange how things work out.
---
I honestly can't remember if I've told my gf. She's at work at the moment lol. Perhaps I'll ask if I've told her when she gets home. I imagine her reaction will just be to roll her eyes though.
---
only way you get dkp is to contribute the most (i.e., showing up for killin bosses)
---
I think the implication was your girlfriend is a tranny.
---
You should make these into posters!  I'd hang it on my wall for sure.
---
Yeah, prayer of healing is actually just cast on self, it's not a targeted spell. That's why it only affects your group.
---
Unless you want to break the game with larger ilvl increases then you'd probably only have several relevant anyway, because if the ilvl difference per tier is very small (like 1 ilvl) then full tier 3 vs full tier 20 would be pretty similar and with world buffs you could easily skip everything in between and then probably jump again to tier 30+
---
Did you take the shadow wallet that doubles spirit and lets you 100% regen for 15 seconds after a kill?
---
Hunter with Striker gear from AQ next? :D
---
You'll most likely die fighting mobs at lower levels? Lol what?
---
yeah but in mulgore you dont have bags
---
Not sure if I should finish the first area and go barrens directly or silverpine + barrens because I may get there "late" and have the whole shebang questing there already :/
---
Or even better, get the gf in the game. You'll end up with someone to level with and can do group quests with, and it really strengthens the relationship. Boyfriend got me into WoW years ago and now when we're leveling we take shifts on who cooks and who gets to power level through dinner.
---
non RP servers always kept more pop, so how can we compare what will make classic last?
---
From a different perspective, flood the deep run tram. Stay on your mountain, damn shorties.
---
I’m sure all kinds of accounts got banned.  it must’ve been worthwhile though, because it was always available.
---
Great minds changing the world right there
---
I took her hand in marriage; and some day i hope to find the rest of her.
---
😚
---
look at the imgur you linked
---
I can't compare, haven't played retail. I imagine the mobs just aggro to you because you're the designated tank, no thought required?
---
I do believe its possible to do lasher farm in DIre Maul as shaman, should be decent gold if the drops are anything like they are on private servers.
---
How jealous will you be at 60, when you can enter any group or raid as Resto, while the Hunter has to pay gold for a carry?
---
MC is the highlight of Hunter PvE dps, they are still stomped by Warriors and Rogues. After Tier 1, that is it, as the scaling does not allow the Hunter to be competitive. By Naxx, Warriors, Mages and Locks will do double the DPS. But that is not even where it ends, because to even be moderately good in tier 1, you have to master a far more complex mechanic than any other DPS.
---
Hunters are the opposite of the Warrior. In that Hunters are frontloaded with "fun", easy leveling, easy gold making, wrecking ball in pug BGs. This is the opposite of the Warrior in every way. But the Warrior excels at end game, scales insanely well with gear and is essentially a better class when all is said and done.
---
I am not saying dont play a Hunter, the class can be very satisfying to master with a huge range of tools. But understand just how hard you will have to work when all that frontloaded "fun" is over with. A Resto Shaman can walk into any raid with ease, they are that much in demand.
---
Seems like a generic tanking video that doesn't offer sources either.
---
&gt;if he was a girl pretending to be a boy
---
 12 year old boy too, when you rejected his advances he became obsessed and became a girl
---
The biggest issue is, that grouping up with others in WoW Vanilla/Classic takes alot of time. Like literally it can take half a day. Two hours is probably the bare minimum it takes to find a group, get to the dungeon and finish the dungeon. There are some expections like Ragefire Chasm or Stockades though.
---
Vanilla dungeons are usually longer than dungeons in expansions, many take 1-2 hours even without fuck ups by the group. Getting to instances also can take alot of time. Overall Horde can reach instances faster. It wouldn't be to surprising if it take ~30-40min for every alliance player to get to the Scarlet Monastery.
---
It also can take alot of time, to find groups for dungeons in the first place. Sometimes even hours. Especially tanks but also healers are often hard to find. You could reduce this issue with picking a class that can fit in any role.
---
A druid can do that and is one of the fastest classes at leveling. You can still heal instances as feral druid, though you might wanna be a level or two higher than usual, especially when you are not used to instances or healing in general.
---
Depending on how good as player you are and how fast you can adopt a different playstyle, it can be quite challenging to be flexible. But if you are, you can do instances pretty much anytime you want.
---
If you are not comfortable with switching roles, warlock could be a good idea as well. Warlocks are able with the assistance of two other players to summon party members. Often you have to wait for one or two players, because some people just take their time, joined the party later or are in the middle of nowhere.
---
Also when grouping up with others, I'd recommend you to tell them how experienced you are. When you're the first time in a specific dungeon or haven't that much experience with a role. There are people that don't want to play with someone, that still has to learn all that stuff and it's better to find out before the instance instead of in the middle of the run. On the other hand, there are plenty of players that might give some useful pieces of advice or make sure you got important quests with great rewards and so on. In general people will be more patient if they know you are learning.
---
You also might tell people how much time you have left before you join a party. Especially if you are not sure, how long an instance will take.
---
I'm gonna play Alliance Mage, what the fuck else do you want me to play? Gnome? No thanks.
---
I prefer the new models, but vastly prefer the old animations. Undead run animation is almost crooked, orcs have a stick up their ass, and trolls I can’t put my finger on, but it’s jarring as well.
---
I would just go on a pvp server. You aren't going to be constantly ganked, and playing flagged on a pve server isn't the same. In my opinion I view pvp servers as the complete experience and would find a pve one boring. Also for all you know she might like the world pvp and danger.
---
Rofl
---
yeah gear sits really well on femorcs, but I got a little board with the animations on my lock, since I play orc from mop until end of legion. They are still good animations, and i wouldn't mind having my sham as one, but for my lock, I wanted to try something else (but 10/10 armour sizing is perfect on them).
---
It'll make a lot of money, sure.
---
It also caused a shitstorm that went through every single subcommunity of Blizzard. Pretty much everything regarding D:immortal is getting downvoted on Youtube and the comments are filled with disappointment.
---
Short term it'll make money like crazy, long term it'll hur their reputation. If they had announced D4 *and* Diablo Immortal it'd be different. People would be accepting of Immortal and think it's a fun holdover until the "real" game comes, but well...
---
They didn't do that. Thus they got a shitstorm.
---
Roots requires outdoors.  There's not a lot of dungeons that qualify as that.
---
I honestly need to buy a better wifi adapter for my PC. It works fine now but it can have issues.
---
Many non tank players had learned this by 60 in vanilla. Nothing proprietary here.
---
You stay in your fury spec, get mining and do DME with a healer who has enchanting.
---
Pretty sure the quest hub was added later than most of the other quest content, similar to searing gorge.  Different methodology at work by that point.
---
I get seasick on boats.I tried to play sea of thieves once, but I got seasick. No joke. Had to quit
---
Yup, although that was just their pure stupidity and hubris to announce it at fucking blizzcon (with all the fanfare of one of their real pc releases) as if people who go to blizzcon want that.
---
If they'd just done a low key announcement the online shitstorm wouldn't have been nearly as bad. Either way it's still going to make fat stacks in the chinese market
---
A good tip at least on P servers is to get between the fear target and the area you already cleared. They always run directly away from me where I am facing initially. I would use this and send them  in other rooms or corners.
---
https://youtu.be/rvTXe9GG7WY
---
Good example of difference between Pserver and Classic is a Human Rogue pickpocketing level 1-3 Kobolds 
---
On a Pserver I could make a Rogue, get to level 4 and spend 30 mins pickpocketing the Kobolds and get ~1g.
---
On Classic you only end up with a handful of silver after 30 mins.
---
That's not your decision to make for somebody who would like to equip it.
---
The biggest thing im looking forward to in classic is no belfs. I swear the second TBC came out half the horde population re rolled Blood Elf.
---
Lots of fans these days are super quiet, which is why I use an air purifier. They also make dedicated white noise machines if you want to save electricity.
---
Exactly, they just don't care about their reputation anymore. Like Bethesda with 76, you gotta keep making all the money it is physically possible for you to make so they take the super short term strategy that destroys their reputation.
---
So because orcs can be warlocks that means they can use axes?
---
Weapon specs are class based not race based
---
I love how you do it. I really do. I am not a good writer myself. I am basically just good being myself.
---
Can we not?
---
See everyone? Rolling horde is good for people and their lives
---
Pretty sure it was in wotlk
---
Finally someone understands ME and my CHALLENGES!!
---
I strafe you'll need to; Rebind strafe left to A and strafe right to D. Use W to move forwards, S to move back. Hold down the right mouse button when you want to change the angle you're running and do so by moving the mouse left or right. You can strafe left/right while running forward or while stationary then hold down right mouse button and turn mouse to circle around a target.
---
Less reliable in classic, targets flee randomly unlike pservers.  Should still reduce chance of complications, though, so good call.
---
Not what?
---
Without capitalism the rich will stay rich and your average Joe will never have a chance to make a million dollars off an idea that is his. You will have less choices and be forced to consume whatever the govt deemed fit. So it comes down to being a human and said humans in the previous post and most of us throughout the world are greedy and we dont care about if you eat or starve. Sorry buddy but thats the way of the world

They’re all as depressed as a poor college student

You guys realize that these guys have been working for almost 30 years in one of the most stressful white collar industries we have today. People retire.
---
And he's pulling without consulting the ruler of his existence, MY MANA BAR.
---
people reserve stuff all the time for their 5mans, masterloot is quite common.
---
Yeah it can but it’s very reasonable to lvl as ret and and pay a very small fee to switch to holy at 60
---
Gotta give fair notice, dps pulls = no heals
---
Tank has gotta look at everyone’s mana before pull- I did that for so long as a reflex, would ask if heals was ready, annoyed people 🤷‍♂️
---
Problem with tanking as a shammy isnt the damage you take its threat generation. Self heals plus shield and mail armory make them durable but you will jave a tough time ever holding aggro.
---
Because stocks often drop for whatever company the internet gets mad at for whatever reason. People panic and do silly things despite there being no actual change in the company's financials during the internet freak outs. Kinda funny to watch happen. Even better to buy after these panics.
---
I mean if your tank isn’t pulling as fast as you like, consider that he might be new, and that his repair bill is going to be much greater than your own, especially if you never wipe.
---
The best was when they would duel without a pet all of the time and still win.
---
I tend to take into account the casting animation. I like that the male has both a healing and damage casting animation. I believe female humans use the same animation for both.
---
&gt; I’m fine with layering permanently damaging the economy
---
Ok Chicken Little.  
---
You're a bit naive to think one small phase is going to permanently damage the economy.
---
It's a really tough and awkward spot because hand on my chest, whenever I encounter a girl in a game it inevitably changes the way I interact with this person. That is in comparison to if it was just another guy, who I respond normally to. It is less so these days, but it used to be that I just avoided playing with a girl if I knew it was one.
---
At the same time though, it's not nice to feel left out or neglected, which will never happen for a girl if she's open about her gender. And it really is true that guys give and do a lot of extra stuff for girls. So yeah, I dunno. Weird spot to be in.
---
The run back to the dungeon is a lot longer.
---
There are loads of people who are married that have met through tinder - that's what I mean by swiping.
---
Plus you can heal dungeons easily as shadow spec at least until 40
---
Dal'rend set is biS for hunters at phase 1...
---
also when they run they will run in the opposite direction of whom they are aggroed to. If well positioned the low hp mob will move right inside the group of dps making it the easiest kill ever
---
I've watched hours and read tons of online info and content about 8.2 long before and even now. I'm very much up to date with the terrible, horrendous thing that is called Lore in retail. Gameplay is bad though, THAT'S why I unsubbed. Why bother doing the raid if I know the story and the gameplay isn't fun. 
---
I admit that the azshara and old gods thing is a decently cool concept but it's not executed very well and it's way too boring and predictable. Woo, a dumb person serves an old god but is then surprised when she doesn't become some all powerful demigod? She thinks she can easily beat the same people that have slain and beaten every obstacle so far? Crazy and interesting stuff!!
---
Honestly 8.2 doesn't matter to me though. I was mostly talking about literally everything before this. Anything concerning Sylvanas, Teldrassil etc. Was so awfully written my 3 year old niece would've done a better job. It's a huge spit in the face of any wow fan.
---
Damge taking wont be your issue threat will be with trying to tank
---
No, sorry, I was specifically talking about the number of RPers who were actively playing a 'half elf' but just using a Void Elf character.
---
Roll a orc warrior.
---
Nah I disagree. Theres tons of options in classic and you would see a lot of people transmog their end game sets into lower level stuff. 
---
Just take a look at some of the old photos people post here. You see those old raiding groups and everyone is wearing the same gear. Ends up making those tier sets look like class uniforms.
---
That's good to hear, I'd hate to stand around for hours trying to finish one quest!
---
The problem is a private company went public. Take that commie shit elsewhere.
---
I definitely have to find me a dad guild with people that are understanding when I have to go afk three times in a run to get my kid a drink or put some fucking dress on some doll or whatever the fuck because they will also be dealing with the same type of shit.
---
Warrior with a shamans windfury totem is amazing. You can tank dungeons and he can heal, so groups will be wasy to put together. 
---
For race, orc is better for pvp, troll pvp.
---
Ah yes, just the comment i needed. Add fuel to the fire of hunter stereotypes.
---
Yah, but this time it matters.
---
Cant block from behind, less damage towards squishy party members
---
all of these posts are just a program generating pictures based on input. instead of spamming the forum all day with things people could easily do, why not make one post explaining how it’s done and people can just do it themselves?
---
There were private players from both those classes as well I don't see your point.
---
Retail is just a harder game, it's players are better that's just that.
---
What do you mean ? He's a chaos champion of Khorne obviously :)
---
just a fact.
---
I am sorry, but you are talking about PRIVATE SERVERS, with mob damage that is clearly off what they will be in Classic.
---
What CCing one of the mobs? There was no such thing in the Beta, and it WILL NOT BE IN CLASSIC, because well...RENEW KEEPS THE TANK AT FULL HEALTH WITH FIVE MOBS ON HIM. If one of the mobs runs away and pulls another pack...Doesn't Matter because the Healer still has a full mana bar.
---
Every single dungeon run in Classic will be focused on efficiency which means nobody has time to kite around mobs that hit even a mage like wet noodles.
---
That, and he negotiated a crazy high salary with the acquiring company.  This was a $15bn/yr company and he was in the top 10 highest paid guys.
---
&gt; You can roll however you want. But if you do such a thing in MY group, you will be accurately labeled as a ninja looter. I will let the server know, discords/forums, etc. I will let your guild leaders know. And then anytime I see you looking for a group, FOREVER, I will let world chat know that you're a ninja looter.
---
wouldn't everyone just rolling need on boes be a lot easier than having to go on a crusade every time someone does not roll the way you like because you're using an inferior and outdated system of handling loot?
---
I think he meant that the animation exists in vanilla, is all.  Orc warriors and hunters after all
---
1.  Create quality addicting great games
---
2.  Attract massive player base
---
3.  Add micro transaction cosmetics
---
Why this isn’t the model across the development market is beyond me.  Look at all the juggernaut titles, they put player experience first so they could get to the golden goose of cosmetics.  People don’t want cosmetics in a shit tier game.  Nor do we want to pay for content through DLC or character unlocks.
---
Triangle is green (hex), diamond is purple (seduce/banish).
---
Blue square is for hunter trap since it looks like an iceblock.
---
Well, it's just a good game. Who could imagine that in 2019 it would be such a rarity.
---
Another version of “beat your meat“?

&gt;mage with blink
---
Won't help one bit against hunters (aspect of cheetah or whatever runs you wodn quickly) or druids (cant be polymorphed and can shift out of frost nove)
---
Immersiveness is the first thing that jumps to mind. Classic throws you into this awesome world and doesn't have features like LFG that take you out of it.
---
yeah not at all. the rank gear is pretty meh for elemental, its enhance gear after all.
---
Corruption+ drain life + arguably siphon life == 3 debuff slots for just your own damage.  No raid will allow you take them. 
---
On the other side, nightfall procs are stronger with nightfall/conflag or SM/ruin builds due to ruin's crit damage bonus.  Your scaling with crit with such a build is null.
---
Fucker had better have said horde
---
suck my ass
---
Wait boys what day is release ?
---
Im the opposite, love shaman but mages bored me to tears back then. Also would likely never roll a warlock, either.
---
&gt;Loot council via democracy. Each class will be responsible for electing its officer. I.e., the mages will an officer for the mage class, warrior for warriors and so on. When loot drops, the elected officer will be responsible for distributing said loot to that class based on “need” or, really whatever that particular class wants. Non class specific items will be put to a vote by the elected officers to decide who will get it.
---
 
---
how do you figure out "what you're worth"?
---
gnome mage.
---
They are tiny and die fast, so better not stand behind them.
---
Some of my best wow friends over the years were females... in wotlk and cata my best raiding buddy were females, things never got weird or awkward and they were both heroic level raiders. Just be yourself and rule out the creeps!
---
You must have gone up like 4 levels.
---
I thought he was into other mmos.
---
Yes, but at the end of the day this game doesn't punish dying in pvp harshly, so if shes willing to just accept random pvp as a fact of life and move elsewhere when bored 60s are hunting in stv she'll be fine.
---
It makes me sad to think back to when I was a kid and could honestly tell people "I just play Blizzard games and Counter Strike" as if Blizzard was a genre unto itself.
---
You are worth exactly as much as you produce.
---
you're on the side of autism
---
I feel like no matter what you got to go manatide if you're that far into resto. Are you dead set on going shaman?
---
Ironically, the term they used on private servers to justify uptuneing those raids was "Blizzlike."

He's been raving about classic.
---
Warrior/Shaman is a top tier duo without a doubt. Warriors benefit greatly from a healer buddy, more so than a mage. Mage and shaman level fine solo, but warriors truly shine with someone who can heal. I would go Orc if you are concerned with perfection and/or like pvp or will be on a pvp server.
---
*classic launch delayed*
---
The hell? I'm asking for them to be as challenging as they should be...
---
Yes do something else. As someone who is playing an Spriest you'll find challenges doing dungeons and getting groups unless you plan to heal. Thus gearing up will be slow because there is always better DPS options.
---
I find mid 30's tolatw 48s awful. 52-60 is a breeze. The XP in WPL, EPL and Silithus is fantastic.
---
I forgot about hunter and thank you for the corrections
---
I have the same ad it makes the website pretty unbearable
---
Yes dude. The parents would always come up with something lol. That’s why when they left town which they would often go to a lake town 3 hours away I’d know I was clear for a weekend. I knew I played too much wow when I’d finally roll to bed and I’d have these weird dreams where my brain combined real life with stuff I was doing in WOW all day. Trippy feeling.
---
I am honestly not sure haha
---
measured by what?
---
If you use a lawn mower to mow a lawn in an hour and get $100, you didn't produce the $100 alone. You used the lawnmower, too. What is the lawn mower "worth" in that scenario?
---
He's a fucking billionaire, what does age have to do with it?
---
No, but retail tanks generate a gazillion times more threat with every move, so it's basically impossible for dps to pull aggro
---

lmao!
---
Play a dwarf female, they are very bouncy and not very common!
---
Gotta embrace the cringe, it's like any skill... Everyone sucks until they practice!
---
Have at it and good luck!  My not trying to tell you that you can’t do it, just sharing my personal experience with attempting it in the past.  Hope it all works out for you guys.
---
Always determine loot rules before hand. If you don't, people are going to take what they want.
---
-A. Hunter ^tm
---
Dunno about that one. Shaman seem like they'll be second most populated after warrior on horde side.
---
&gt; What is the lawn mower "worth" in that scenario?
---
The cost of the parts and labor combined.
---
Yeah.  He lived in a 10,000sqft palace in a very exclusive area of our state.  Still was really humble though.  Rode his Harley to work.  Cool dude.  Money didn't change him.
---
Pff. Not my way off how it should be played, it’s how it’s going to be played. It’s the nature of the game.
---
lolbertarian detected.
---
Hey, where is Atari at now?
---
A ton of people do that already on my high pop realm, so its rather risky, but fair enough. I bought hundreds of Viper Fish, made it into 25 of the best feasts, and it took me nearly a week of undercutting to finally sell them, with the price going down every day, I ended up making barely any profit. Ended up selling them for 1.5k each, because someone whispered and wanted to buy it at that price for all 25 of them. I decided to go with it since these things won't sell and more and more people are unlocking the recipe, they were worth 12k each when I originally listed them as very few people had the recipe, mythic raid unlocked so I really thought they'd sell
---
I suck at economy stuff, but its always risky
---
Ayyy it’s ya boy
---
Soon they will be so bad they can buy out themselves from Activision and become independent again like Bungie... 🤫
---
That's a great idea, I'll look into it.

&gt;The works could own the lawnmower machine shop, and produce the lawnmower

you cracked the code: why don't you go out and make a co-op landscaping company
---
if what you're saying is true, then you should outcompete other businesses by poaching their workers by paying them "what they're worth"

of course socialists don't do that

every time they try, they fail miserably and instead end up whining on the internet about what's owed to them *by others* who are actually *producers* and what they're "worth"

Rogue can kite for sure. You grab aggro from a mob or multiple mobs and sprint-evade as far away as you can, back down the dungeon hallways that you’ve already cleared, and then vanish at the last moment. You don’t need to “keep threat” because in a kiting scenario you’ve suddenly pulled an extra mob and the tank can’t grab threat on all of the mobs. You’re not going to lose threat on a mob if it’s chasing you down a hallway away from your group.
---
Addons that play the game for you don't really work with the modern addon API. So I wouldn't expect healbot to come to classic.
---
In vanilla you don't ha e to raid endlessly like in retail I can get a piece from zg or mac or bwl and it might last me until AQ and NAXX but in retail every fucking 4montha there is a reset and I have to grind over to change every piece that i have and it uses to be that i needed to grind azerite too while am at it , in vanilla i remember stopping for months when i burn out comeback and am not that far left behind I just need to farm consumes join the 2-3 raids a week and am back on track no mythic dungeons endless solo every day to get what I want .
---
Oompa Loompa doompety doo take the early retirement package before Activision downsizes you too
---
What items were available in this early iteration of the holiday events?
---
That's not what Healbot is: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/heal-bot-continued
---
The friend who got me into wow back then was a day one player, rolled a pally, got to 60, and immediately figured out he was only a healer (I'm not sure anyone told him this, he had a mind for games and figured it out pretty quickly). His next move was to roll a warlock and never looked back. Years later when transfers were available he transferred that pally to his pvp server, mostly as a joke. He did end up a healer in one way though, as a stone cold monster resto druid in arenas, but that pally was always there on his character select screen as a reminder of what could have been if Blizzard had paid more attention to the hybrid classes.
---
I know which holidays there are but I dont know the available items and collectables from each holiday as they changed over the years.
---
Zug zug!
---
The thing about Thottbot &amp; Allakazam is that they were community driven. Someone could erroneously report a drop (intentional or not) and it could be added to the loot table because no one really knows whether it's true or not.
---
Currently wirting my bachelorthesis and spending time with gf, essentially preparing to go no life for about one and a half weeks.
---
Also spending too much time thinking about classic.
---
Ah, nothing like some 4+ year aged cheese.
---
These people don't know what it means to actually be good at this game. They think being good means doing stuff like CCing mobs and waiting for mana. If you're good you don't need that stuff or you only have to use it when its absolutely necessary, and are capable of recognizing that. These people clearly can't recognize that.
---
One of the devs/administrators said they "will look at it closer to the release of classic." [Source](https://healbot.dpm15.net/forum/general/324-healbot-for-classic-wow#1306).
---
I was a lvl \~33 Orc warrior who finally had all the mats for WW Axe, I just needed a little help to kill Cyclonian. After an unsuccessful recruiting session I went to turn in the mats anyway and wait to complete another time.
---
Shortly after I turned in the mats I just afked in front of the nearby questgiver. Then a 60 gnome war ran by and auto'd me once.
---
I Paused.
---
He did it again. So I started the quest, and he obliterated the quest mob for me.   Awesome guy, got my WW axe easier than ever.
---
Oooh I really feel bad when I read the cello part lol. I could see you like playing wow tunes and your parents just like no no no get back to the program! Anyways I’m glad you get to experience this special freedom this time around!
---
I love how in all of your shame you decide to be ultra specific and name-drop Rotan, lmao.
---
I think it's interesting how deeply people follow the rabbit holes of their imagination.  There's nothing tangible here, and yet internet guy develops feelings for a 12 year-old boy playing a female night elf.
---
What is there to take hold of (except the obvious female ne hoppity hop)?
---
I'm a melee hunter. Respect my life choices.
---
The cartoons in the 90s were awesome! So simple yet awesome
---
Why don't you reply to the actual comment instead of making up some bullshit that he didn't even say?
---
I read this question at first as can humans ride gnomes, missed the mount bit at first
---
It’s the exact same material covered in this post meant for the same audience and matches verbatim and point for point.
---
The source is obvious. Yours isn’t.
---
I was googling around and saw an alternative approach to loot distribution than the usual suspects... members make a list when they join the guild ranking items they want according to rules for point spread and class priorities. Your item score is your initial ranking plus a small modifier, say 1x(attendance in % over last 8 weeks), plus an additional small modifier times number of times the item has dropped and you haven’t received it. Each item dropped goes to whoever has the highest score for that item then they’re wiped. The one I was looking at had separate listings for mc+bwl and aq40+naxx.
---
What am I missing that is keeping something like this from being more popular given that we know all the loot? Seems like agreeing ahead of time would resolve a lot of issues with DKP or LC. 
---
On guild structure it’s not apparent to me that there’s any one right way as long as the guildmaster is more excited about making a great group than getting shinies for her/himself.
---
No shit.
---
This is brilliant satire of therealrecollector.
---
Ok, I think you missed the context of the link.
---
Lmao imagine thinking 2-3 weeks of layering will damage an economy for years.
---
TBC increased rep rewards quite a bit.
---
He 'll get it when he has 12 views and 10 dislikes per video.
---
Yes, but a cow-man can wield a big ass axe and look formidable. Sort of like a Minotaur. A gnome on the other hand looks feeble.
---
I’ll let you know when the beta is back up for stress test
---
Shaman.
---
Those are all buggy trash.  They didn't even make new vegas.
---
Nixxion is kinda handsome ngl #nohome
---
A lot of addon's creators can't test them properly (no beta). So don't expect to have a lot of Classic addons available at launch. 
---
I think we'll survive few weeks without them. We are here for Vanilla after all :)
---
Lmao imagine thinking Phase 1 will last 2-3 weeks when there are 6 Phases in total.
---
Genius.
---
I personally dislike even Microtransaction cosmetics. I *tolerate* them at most.
---
How great would thunderfury be if you could buy an axe in its style? Or a mace? Gotta make those $$$ so might as well sell the coolest looking weapon in many people's eyes!
---
Or how about games where you just always look like a hobo unless you pay money in which case you become a rave god? I *love* Path of Exile and considering it's a free to Play game with no strings attached I don't mind it there, especially with how gameplay focused the game is, but I just don't want to see this crap in games where looks are a driving motivator for gameplay.
---
Would people really care for epics and hold them to such high regard in Vanilla if there were 200x cooler looking stuff on the shop? Because you *need* to sell cool looking gear. Bothers me in every MMO I play, even Retail. Don't make me buy gear.
---
That's why I used to love sub to play. You get the *entire* game and the game itself gets constant updates and is quality. That's why I pay a sub; to get a huge MMORPG and be spared of all this free to play stuff. 
---
If you're fine with that, cool. But I really dislike this trend of looking like garbage in a bunch of games only to be told to pay $$$ to actually look cool (or become a neon rave god, killing all immersion. But people buy em so they'll make more!)
---
I don't think you should pick a class based on what it can do at end game. 
---
Do you like casting spells and having totems as a hybrid class? Or taming pets and using ranged? 
---
I think that's about as far as you should be going with the decision. Rolling hunter to farm mara is not a reason unless you're some kind of chinese gold farmer
---
It's odd how people perpetuate misinformation about it isn't it
---
Not in classic.   https://classicdb.ch/?item=16252
---
Clearly you have not been to a strip club. You think all that body spray those ladies use is for nothing? Toss some black lotus perfume on her and she's good to go!
---
It's predominantly due to the API being different from what Vanilla used since we are getting BfA's backend.
---
I remember I was 11 during classic so that may have been the reason lol
---
&gt; Captialism dictates infinite growth, without infinite growth your company is deemed dying by shareholders and the like I reckon
---
damn brother, you're making a good case for alternatives to capitalism in 1 sentence
---
You can just as easily blame capitalism for the golden age of Blizzard gaming that happened and we all got to enjoy.
---
Capitalism is good because it lets us the consumer ultimately have all the power. Big game companies are disappointing us with their releases but you know who’s killing it? All these indie companies making amazing games. I like to use Hollow Knight as an example, an indie game I bought for $14 and put 100 plus hours in.
---
Capitalism is not the problem.
---
Blood for the blood god.
---
Phase 1 will last 12 days when there are 6 Phases in total?
---
Ahahahahaha. 
---
Did you fail mathematics in high school by any chance?
---
He’ll get wrecked by a couple lvl 48s
---
They're pre raid bis hunter lol
---
In all polls Shaman are usually the #2 most polled class to be played for Horde. So please don't use this as a decision, OP.
---
Every raid needs about 3 hunters. If you want to raid, find a good guild and show that you know your stuff. You'll be fine.
---
I think it's very bad system since you will earn a lot of points (places) in farm raids, but no one will want to do progression bosses since they'll earn nothing.
---
wow, pulls out the T_D posting and admits to actually thinking Communism is a viable economic model. Also, how IS Venezuela these days?
---
He was playing others but it was due to BfA just being garbage.  He's beyond nostalgic for Vanilla though as he referenced it a lot in his videos.
---
Read my comment in reply to the same guy! If you want to raid as Hunter you'll be able to.
---
I bougth a gaming chair and 3 weeks off from work but after that I need to go to vocation:(
---
You're not passive-aggressive enough to be a healer, sorry. 
---
You have to roll a Rogue.
---
Did you see E3? They paid some people or atleast hand picked em to cheer and pray to them as if FO76 was the hottest shit ever, and then when Doom Eternal came on you heard *normal* amounts of cheering. For an actual game people care about.
---
Because those people weren't paid/weren't hand picked to pretend their game is jesus.
---
&gt;"Fuck yeah we made Fallout into a battle royale!"
---
Are people supposed to care? Does anyone sincerly want a Fallout 76 Battle Royale? Your game barely functions and your games usually don't anyway, they're also really basic in their structure anyway so if even those suck and are bugged beyond belief...
---
Yeah add some overhyped gamemode whose bubble will burst in the next few years to your broken game. That'll help.
---
Nah, tank and healer need to stick together and blame dps always. That's the way that God intended.
---
It’s supposed to come out around the end of the year around Christmas I believe.
---
Engineering is always very useful for extra dps in poe or incredible utility in pvp
---
I have no sense of smell.  I don't see what the problem is.
---
So mean :(
---
Hunter, I literally grinded all classes to 110 and tried to do hunter but left him at 67.  They were always favored in PvP through the expansions I played as they only needed to pop CDs to one shot something with faceroll mechanic which wasn't fun for me.
---
&gt; but you will want +1 to prevent loot trading ninjas.
---
This is not a solution to loot trading, you can have multiple people still roll for an upgrade for one person and trade it. 
---
The only difference is that you lose one person who can collude per item.
---
That was the joke lol
---
Double checked on Thottbot and you're right. I have been misinformed. I remember doing it only in the tower but other people insisted that it was better to farm it at Tyrs. Sorry about spreading misinformation.
---
I clicked all of them, take the following two as an example. Both require you to get the +shadow damage roll but there's what, 20 different possible suffixes? My point was that half you gear requires you to get the +shadow damage roll but you're not going to get that realistically. 
---
The pve bis set is retarded for pvp, which is exactly my point. This PVE bis list just stacks +shadow damage which is great for pve but shit for pvp since you're basically made of glass. You need much more stam than your list gives you if you ever want to "melt faces".
---
I didn’t really care for the video at all to be honest, and I wouldn’t watch another of his videos if it looks like this. First of all the thumbnail is just an absolutely awful jumbled mess. I would never click on a video with a thumbnail like that if I were just browsing YouTube and came across it. Why is the entire video sped up? There’s no context as to what’s going on at all. He’s got his action bars cropped out, which bothers me as well. He could easily just watch any number of  vanilla PvP videos and emulate what he sees. I’m sure he has potential to improve, and if he’s a good player maybe people would enjoy watching with better editing.
---
I mean, it's fine to want to grow, but some companies go too far; hypercapitalism in videogame developers drives them to care less and less about their products and more and more on how to squeeze the most cash out of their games.
---
This leads to companies like Bethesda or EA. I'm not saying "CaPiTaLiSm bAd" or something like that; sorry, it did come across that way. But the way capitalism is laid out *by AAA videogamecompanies* seems to be counterintuitive for decent games.
---
You start making decent games, become famous for your decent games and become AAA, then your shareholders gain more power as they make more money short term but 10 years later no one who actually makes your product/game knows how to actually make it or what made it work in the first place.
---
Capitalism isn't bad, but the way some big companies handle their internal ongoings doesn't seem to create decent games. I *did* make it sound like capitalism is literally Hitler, I apologize for that.
---
You literally told a guy the game probably isn’t for him because he doesn’t have the time to play in this abundantly slow way that you apparently plan to play it.
---
I’ve been in 3+ hour BRD groups, or slow UBRS groups, but I’ve been in FAR more (like 100x more) 15 minute lava  speed BRD runs, Rend runs, 90 minute full MC clears, etc.  
---
Again, telling a guy the game might not be for him because he doesn’t want to play in this fantasy style of yours that absolutely nobody will be forced into is utter bull shit.
---
Casting banish again on an already banished target removes the banish.
---
I see they updated it and added it to the new mount tab system, and it's even byable with some kind of currence.. however in vanilla you actually had these mounts in your bag, like shown in the picture below  
---

I liked to farm the Northdale (NOT THE PRIVATE SERVER!!!! so don't delete my post ;)) location in Eastern Plaguelands.  The ghosts are fairly easy to take down and there are so many around.  They drop a good amount of runecloth, greys, greens and major mana potions (save for raiding or sell on the ah for good $$$).  There are also 3 water elementals that spawn in the nearby lake that drop essence of water.  A chest spawns every hour in one of the broken down homes as well as x2 rich thorium vein nodes along the surrounding mountain side.   You can even get a Black Lotus there too.  The ghosts only have an annoying hit% loss curse that can be interrupted.  This is one of the best high level mage aoe farming spots.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  See you in Classic!
---
An entire server is relevant demand.
---
This is classic, Death is the real time waster
---
Having played on several prominent private servers, I can tell you with absolute certainty you’re wrong.  There will be multiple people at level 60 in under a week and people will be ‘zooming’ around, speed running 5 mans, 10 mans, and 40 mans well before the masses hit 60.
---
Just stop with this fictitious bull shit you’ve created in your own head, it stinks.
---
Hunter to 60 so I can stock up on ore and skins, then I will slowly level up a handful of alts that will help me to support my methodical foray into the art of a tanking warrior.
---
Because they actually respect them. Putting someone else's happiness and comfort before your own isn't "being a pussy" ESP if it is your wife. With that said - don't get taken advantage of either. They need to be willing to do the same for you.
---
Problem is with WoW you can't do as many cosmetic things. The weapons and armour (should be) ruled out of microtransactions as they're the core part of the game. However if it didn't mean a complete dogshit game I'd be happy with, and believe they could make a good amount of money with:
---
Mounts
---
Cloaks
---
Haircuts or tattoos (ie. Naked gnomes running round with a mohawk and full sleeve tats)
---
Possibly alternative models, like different spell casting animations or unlocking a "fat" character model or something
---
Tokens, paid weapons or weapon art in the shop to make your WW axe look like TF and anything else which gets rid of the competitive or admirative - wanting to get what other people have got from hard work - imo ruin the game and can get to fuck
---
This. Its buggy as hell and there isn't one single thing in those game i would consider suberb. Sure its a big world but thats it? I don't get it
---
Only 1% of all players have ever seen naxx in vanilla and even less have killed any bosses there.
---
Cthun was unkillable for a while and some optional bosses were rarely ever killed.
---
Sure experienced players will breeze through vanilla content if they minmax comps and buffs but a good chunk of guilds of wont get past the first 2 bosses in BWL just like in the good old days I’d bet money on it.
---
Classic wow is Simple but not easy.
---
One person can blow up the whole raid in more than one occasion. 
---
10ppl dying to breath on ony?
---
1 person pulling 40 welps? 
---
Those things can still wipe a raid and not everyone played on private servers or progressed raiding in the past.
---
Even to this day theres many guilds on pservers that didn’t full clear naxx or aq40.
---
And their armor values and resistances might even be too low there...

---
ABOUT US
---
Looking for a casual raiding guild that'll still progress, aren't up their own asses and just want to make new memories in classic with you?
---
We're a casual oriented friend/family guild that will be rolling on an alliance PVE realm. We're a raiding guild first and foremost but still plan to dabble in PvP for sure. The guild was made with adults in mind. So those that have jobs, families and a life outside of wow yet know how to bring it during the weekend and raid nights is exactly the type of person I made this guild for. Casual yet competent.
---
GOALS
---
We're NOT in a rush to hit max level. Of course raiding is in our sights and I expect us to get going around Dec or so. Take your time, enjoy this revival of classic we've been waiting so long for but don't forget we're here to raid at some point. So be ready for that as well.
---
RAID SCHEDULE (Central Standard Time) 
---
We're thinking a mid week raid once ZG, AQ20 rolls out but for the main raid group Fridays and Saturdays are likely. We'll adjust depending on whos recruited into the guild. 2-3 hour raid nights on the weekends.
---
LOOT
---
Right now we’re thinking a variation on DKP and Loot Council. The more you help the more gear you get but there’s going to be moments here and there where a tank should get first dibs to help the whole raid progress. Thats just an example but you get the picture. For the most part things are going to be as fair as possible. This is a promise to anyone that joins. 
---
EXPECTATIONS
---
Please check out the guild website for expectations / rules etc.
---
For more info please checkout our website https://www.competentcasuals.com/index.html
---
Link to Discord can be found on the site. Please look over the rules first.
---
As a mage, this. Ugh.
---
Aq40 will gear your elemental.
---
If you're worried about your time being wasted, don't play an MMO.
---
That’s actually really nice that you let them have time to do their parent duties. Lots of guilds would say tough luck, if you can’t devote your time to the guild then you can’t play.
---
I've played and enjoyed all classes from vanilla but could never get the hang of DK. Just not feeling the rhythm with those.
---
Rogues.....always rogues :(
---
With Bethesda its even worse because they have no shareholders that they have to please.
---
What kinda guild you forming? I was a war officer on nighthaven w some world firsts- pm me :)
---
As a future druid, lol... character sex man's nothing to me
---
I always wanted a sero arm.
---
The devs said specifically that they'll hard stop layering after phase 1 no matter what, but will only keep it for as long as they need to.
---
Which means if the tourists stay, then they'll start finding other solutions like free realm transfers to new realms before phase 1 is over.
---
Skulls for the skull throne
---
Very funny thread.
---
You're trolling us, right ? This is your own channel ?
---
S-same
---
I think the dwarf male model looks okay I priest gear, the human male model does look strange in priest gear. One benefit to picking the human female model is that is visually smaller, given the illusion you are running faster.
---
Or, hear me out, "don't waste everybody's time". I don't care what you define as a waste of time. We're all here to play the game. Don't waste our time.
---
Realistically, the only reason most people any kind of worth at all is because of that capitalists leech. Let’s be honest, if there weren’t people offering jobs, most people wouldn’t be able to earn a living. There’s a reason people apply to jobs and don’t just start their own companies. They can’t or don’t want to deal with what that comes with. At the end of the day, *every single person* in the US has the option of telling their capitalist “leech” to fuck off and start their own business to *reap* (reeks = has a strong odor, usually bad) the reward themselves... but they don’t. 
---
Please consider that your options for income aren’t limited to being someone else’s employee. As an employee, you are guaranteed your paycheck just for being there.... as an owner you don’t make anything unless your company is profiting. You’re more than welcome to take that risk if you’re that unhappy with being “leeched” off of.

&gt;Capital can be provided by anyone, like the govt, without extracting wealth from the poor laborers, and funneling it to the corrupt capitalist.
---
Where do you think the government gets that money? Taxes, IE extracting wealth from the citizens, including the poor laborers. I guarantee you’re getting more from your employer than the government provides for you. Lol that’s why people with jobs live a higher quality of life than people living off of government assistance.
---
Shamans are also one of the most played classes. It will be really fun when 6 other resto shamans have the same goal of getting ele gear
---
Drugs.
---
that is one old nixxiom pic.
---
Love the representation of each spec.
---
What are you smoking ? If you can't rise to the shaman challenge then stand down.
---
I spent almost all of my time after my PvP grind to rank 11 on Shadowmoon tormenting people at Black Rock Mountain/ Burning Steppes. I had a few run-ins with a NE rogue named Muhd, and we had some pretty memorable 1v1 fights which led to a mutual respect that had us no longer fighting rather watching each other destroy the opposing faction for hours on end which we did for weeks. I had similar experiences with some of the alliance GM group when we crossed paths however, none of them ripped it up like my rogue homie Muhd. One of my fondest memories from vanilla.
---
Dropped 7 lbs (174 to 167) since early June.  I'd like to drop 3 more by August 26th (and keep it going to the mid 150s after).

Need to buy or build a standing desk.  PC was already upgraded in May.

Check my post history this is not my channel. I will genuinely send someone a pizza for a quality list of shit examples with timestamps in his videos, description of why it is shit, and a video with an example of something that he shouldve done. Post half here and if that half is good ill PM you for the other half and give u ur pizza. Or withold the example videos etc

It got worse. The guild fell apart during Sunwell. These are just rumors, but the couple that led the guild went through a nasty break up bc she was cheating on him and he developed a mad alcohol dependency shorty after BT. Crazy ass guild drama and crazy how small servers knew details on almost everything for each person. 
---
It legit felt like real life in its own little ecosystem. Made great friends, saw great hurt, and met some of life’s most challenging moments. Learning empathy, patience, and kindness all bc of this lil video game and the people in it. Ah I hope the community feels the same when classic comes out.
---
What? Drop chances are ALWAYS rng.
---
Which makes them excellent rogues or mages imo!
---
Guess I’ll be playing the old version as a lead up to classic. That would have been an awesome cross promotion with classic to play the lore beforehand.
---
Package or speed?
---
And?
---
Phase 1 is your introductory phase, and for that it is a significant phase.
---
Because of the outlined reasons above, and because its for the entirety of Phase 1, it will do enough damage to drive a lot of people away from Classic.
---
Plus you bring up a good point - the possibility of tourists not going away. 
---
You're assuming they'll offer free realm transfer. I'm going to wager they will keep layering post Phase 1 if that happens.
---
Doesn't matter anyway since layering will do enough damage for the entirety of Phase 1.
---
so what?  
---

Thanks so much for the information. Hey, I recognize your username. Did you make a YouTube video where you tested different PC's to figure out the system req's for Classic? I watched it last night! You really did a great job and it helped me a ton.

Hunters benefit from them a lot
---
Healers are probably the most difficult to play in BFA dungeons and mythics but in vanilla it's completely brainless for the most part. I've always played healers in PvE and PvP and it's night and day. I'm going Shadow in vanilla though.
---
That was my first raid in a new guild for me. Dropped in with my druid and left with most of a stormrage set. Why? well else it would just be DE'ed and given how it was better than my at the time crap clearly not bis preraid set, it made for a huge upgrade.
---
Entire run was just gear up the druid, he needs it. But thats what happens when you join a guild that has been farming stuff for a while.
---
I like how he instantly deleted his account and this post... :D
---
Posts like these make me question if people knowing wow know of reddit but not of google, since you can get a faster answer by typing the same thing one-to-one in Google.
---
Relax boys, dont take it so hard, its just a joke, not a dick.
---
What testing?! I can literally log on right now and watch it not proc consistently!! Youre full of shit
---
Well stated. Are you planning on going through his other videos to get that pizza? If you do just withhold time timestamps and counter example vids, but post a few notes here for a couple of his vids and PM the witheld info

You can test 95% of the functionality in BFA, and there were already a lot of addons during Beta, so that's not really true.
---
&gt;step1: campaign and buy votes.
---
Campaigning won’t be allowed, and you can’t vote for yourself either.
---
&gt; step2: Objectively come to the conclusion that I deserve all loots.
---
&gt;step3: Reject their vote of no confidence. Maintain leadership.
---
You wouldn’t be able to “reject” their vote. If a majority of that class wanted that person demoted then the guild leader would demote said person from their officer position and promote a new one when said person was chosen.
---
They can’t ruin classic until all phases are pushed out.
---
That’s why I’ve been telling people to not blaze through content and demand the next phase to be pushed. Inevitably you’ll only see Blizzard-Activision get more hands on and start destroying Classic.
---
We’ll get old Blizzard until all phases are released, then its gloves off after that.
---
A good healer keeps everyone alive. A great healer keeps everyone alive and doesn't have to drink after every pull.
---
I heard private servers drop bags way more often and classic beta was dropping a LOT more grays and junk items for vendoring.
---
You can blame console kiddies for this. Blizzard stopped making PC only games ( good games ) and now all they make are console games so they can sell it to the masses of kiddies.
---
I've gotten those two on a lock, it isn't hard to run for those 2 items, you see many warlocks and mages using their versions of these 2 items. Pretty sure there are some restrictions on the rdm ench based on what it is (Armour type/weapon) so it is a bit easier then you make it out to be, just in my own experience. 
---
Ignore the fucking greens mate.
---
&gt; Great games take effort, effort takes time.
---
Anthem had loads of time. It lacked a cohesive vision.
---
Yeah, people think it means he was at odds at Blizzard, but in actuality he made a shit ton of money and is close to his retirement age.
---
He could be leaving because he sees it as the titanic, but more than likely he just wants to see his family as he grows older.
---
You nailed it in your original post. There’s no context, I have no idea who’s he’s playing or why I should be interested. 
---
Get him a mic and have him explain what’s happening. Very few internet ‘personalities’ can work off a raw game video and even then they have intros on what’s happening. 
---
Either way, top dude/dudette for actually giving a fuck. Everyone needs a friend like you.
---
Good question, it will be interesting to see what presents are available for the first winters veil.  Like some of the mecha tonk pets you could battle with others  
---
And not quite a holiday but I remember the Mountain Dew pet that you could fill with a certain color of liquid, though can’t recall when that specific event actually happened.
---
I am specifically looking at doing PVE, is the orc warrior best for that application?
---
I haven't had a cell phone for over 8 years by choice. Nobody bothers me ever. Get on my level.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
What makes the troll better for PVE over the orc? Sorry if this is obvious but I don’t really know anything about this game!
---
I lvled a lot of ALTs in vanilla and tbc. And played on a lot of the big p servers.
---
Always got waaaay many more bags on pservers. Waaaay many more green and blue boe items.
---
For Lothar!
---
Reddit is Google to some people, once the game is out it's going to get so much worse
---
If you do anything for long enough you’ll eventually get tired of it.
---
It's not - they just assume people are asking about vanilla healbot, which automated beyond what is possible today.
---
If you google that question it populates 15 webposts stating a private server was shut down november of last year...just sayin
---
Orc over troll for PvE raiding endgame?
---
I'm sorry you took this so personally.
---
Trying to figure out if its July 8th 2006, or August 7th 2006. Damn different calendar system
---
Mages
---
God fucking dam they are boring. I want to study the mindset of someone who only presses frostbolt over and over again and finds it fun
---
We are paying for it though, it's hard to get good and dedicated players with such a casual approach to raiding unfortunately. It's also Naxxramas, you can't really just disappear for 15 minutes in such a hardcore raid. We are doing it voluntarily though because we were supposed to raid casually on ND as a break between LB and Classic. We also have prot paladins, retris and boomkins in our raids.. you're just not gonna progress far into Naxxramas with the players that such a setup attracts. If you put a prot paladin, retri and a boomkin into Null (top guild atm) they will definitely still clear Naxx because the rest of the raid is so good. You just can't get to that point by allowing raiders to be so casual. It's really sad actually.

&gt;End of beta : Event - WoW Classic Beta Test - World of Warcraft ...

---
Blood elves are the greatest tragedy ever thrust upon the horde
---
The droprates and drop on private servers are very wrong, bosses in raids can drop mix of the items not possible to drop.   
---
Like getting 2 weapons of ragnaros etc. It takes ex. 3 items out of the total of the pool. Instead of how it should be, 1 of those, 1 of that 1 of that.   
---
Not only are they wrong, but the have intentionally increased both procc rates and drop rates of stuff.
---
If the mage will be your main character than human any day. In fact I'd say this for all classes, just for how useful extra diplomacy is.
---
Only for a small amount of time, then they become the same thing
---
Mage. It's not just WoW though, I've never been into pure casters in any MMO.
---
On alliance paladin is the best. 
---
For horde I’d probably go priest, horde doesn’t have enough that go holy/disc so that’d be good. Shamans can be really helpful but there will be a decent amount of them. Druids can be really good and you’ve got bear form and travel form and when people attack you
---
thanks for the condescension but I don't think you understand vanilla at all, for tanks to outthreat genuinely GOOD dps they need to trade a lot of tankiness for more damage output. Doing so, switching into berserker stance for even a 1 auto attack from the boss could mean instant death. That's why it's not only safer but BETTER in general to have multiple fear wards off cooldown to ensure the tank survives. The spirit racial is something that sounds good on paper and while a human priest can outheal a dwarf priest the utility of being a dwarf will ensure that you will probably not lose your raid spot to a human
---
but that's just if you want to be good, if you're fine with having 3 seperate raid days a week for each individual raid because you don't want to tryhard that's completely fine by me, but keep me out of it
---
Holidays in classic where all about cosmetics and fun items. Winter event gave you some low level recipes for frostdamage you could use for your mage alt while leveling.
---
Halloween was about collecting candy and transforming you into skeleton etc. 
---
No headless horseman and brewfest giving you free epics, this is vanilla :p
---
I dont remember honestly. Im eagerly expecting them to showup again after launch
---
Horde.
---
Skinning, but it's only going to barely make enough profit to justify itself if you don't get devilsaur. In other words, don't bother.
---
Its best, if you are a new tank, to run with guildies a few times before you PUG a group. Build confidence with patient players, then play with PUGs.
---
Almost set yes. I want to heal at 60 but I've always loved the solo aspect. Since my friends are going horde it only gives me three options - priest I don't like and I'm not convinced about druid healing, I also like the playstyle and totems of the shaman.
---
I love hunter but cba to be a DPS due to high competition among DPSers overall.
---
I dont remember honestly. They died all when blizz introduced guildbanks. But I eagerly expect them back for classic
---
Honestly, just play the game consistently and you'll make gold.
---
High level greys are worth decent sums of silver/gold, you can sell any profession-related items you don't need, and enchanter friends can DE green armor pieces for you to sell the materials (always sell green weapons.)
---
"Making money" in WoW is more about doing *something* that gets you drops, regardless of what the actual activity is. No one made money idling in IF... most had to dance on mailboxes.
---
Also, don't spend your gold on shit you don't need. This is a bigger factor than anything else. If you're capable of doing the content you're currently doing, even if it's not optimal, it's not worth spending that silver to buy a new weapon off the AH. No classes actually "need" to spend money to level on anything except ammo and food/drink (and drink/food is even optional if you have a Mage friend.)
---
Why the hell would targets be marked in dungeons though? What kind of Classic did you play vs the rest of the world?
---
That alpha version of the female troll tho
---
[So sexy](https://i.redd.it/r3h642gc0jq11.jpg)
---
Priest. I can respect people for being them, but it's not at all fun for me to play.
---
This is a spam account, look at their post history and karma.
---
Millions considering the subs kept rising, and Paladins and Shaman went multi faction for the first time.
---
I haven't encountered this mindset at all tbh, could it be an NA/EU thing? I'm currently in a guild I thought was casual but actually they're gonna force us all to grind flasks (Ew) and the GM siad it's fine if I wanna go shadow later
---
I feel like Druid fills the "jack of all trades" role better than Shaman though. Imo
---
Sounds like something the master of deception would say...
---
Druid. A jack of all trades, but master of none. I'd rather be very good at one thing and stick to it, druid gameplay just feels like a mess to me.
---
And yes, I know a skilled druid can pull of stunts like no other, I still don't like the gameplay.
---
If you go healer at end game the women will throw themselves at your feet, you will be a VIP everywhere you go, your hair will grow fuller, bank account richer, etc.
---
In all seriousness, these things have a way of working themselves out. Full resto shaman won't be as mana intensive as a half resto, but you should play what you love and try different things, there is no substitute for experience. Just keep you eyes on your mana, shaman are thirsty.
---
If you're playing a dwarf(which you should be for majestic beards) go in strathome use the dwarves racial treasure find it lets you to see the real crates throughout the dungeon those grey items sell for around 50 silver and you can get a lot of vendor junk from those crates there's also some other things like mana and health potions. Righteous orbs as someone has mentioned and pristine black diamonds are also hot ticket items all in all strathome is good dungeon. What I'll be doing to make money is herb farming very relaxing, Gromsblood in blasted lands or Dreamfoil in azshara or winterspring for black lotus are my prime spots for farming.
---
They are good for hunters. But they are way better for wars/rogues in terms of raw power. Once DM hits, hunters have a better weap available, whereas warriors and sword rogues do not.
---
You think there will be more Shaman than Priest?
---
I know the tower spellbinders def do, idk about the archmages in tyr's hand as I never got to test it myself on pservers, as the pservers let them spam counterspell when you try to cast against them. Looking it up now, it does look like they dropped from archmages later on in the game but I don't think so in 1.12
---
Shaman and priest.
---
20% skill
---
Going to say, drop rates aren’t close. 
---
I remember having to kill a lot of spiders for spider silk in Vanilla. They were very expensive on AH as well. 
---
On pservers, spider silk is too too common. Drops everywhere and sells for cheap on AH.
---
Yes, that was me. I made a large post about it on this sub, too; it's linked under the "Common questions" section of this subreddit's Wiki. I'm glad it was helpful!
---
Once phase 2 is out [Barbarous Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18520/barbarous-blade) is a better alternative with less competition.
---
thought this meme format's been dead, apparently not
---
Yup, classic beta had a ton of gray weapons to vendor. Also, my shaman got a lot of gray ragged leather pieces and flimsy chain to sell. Pretty good. What did stand out was the much lower food drop rate, bag drop rate obv, and the drop rate of linen was all a ton lower than pserver
---
No way, I just said that.
---
Yeah, feels like Blizzard added Barberous Blade to stop hunters from rolling on these.
---
Ahhh, yeah. I took a bit of creative liberty by making her float for sure :P
---
There will be more shaman than priests but of the two, more shaman will give up during leveling. Its very micromanagey, and a chore after 40, whereas priests in shadow form fly 40-60. Also, three races can be shaman, while only two can be priests. Almost all shaman will be orcs, almost all priests undead. If you actually want to heal, you can't go wrong with either since half those shaman think they are son of unbreakable, and half those priests will stay shadow at end game.
---
thank you .
---
in a heartbeat

I think we should use terminator rules for calendars and time travel.

Thank you very much!

If you don't have BFA it's just a legion subscription.
---
I never played alliance and I am concidering playing a Palladin healer. Is there a spec that would be optimal for pve and pvp?
---
Yea idk why.
---
My dude! That is the build I'll be using for my Troll Priest for both PvP and PvE. Only difference is I took two points out of Imp Inner Fire and so I could grab Imp Mana Burn.
---
Vice is so hit or miss. Either really engaging or full of shit.
---
Not as many people are going to be turned off by being a healer. It will still happen, there's just so much information available now. It won't be a big surprise for most people.
---
had a good laugh reading this blablabla while there is and always was consensus that 4-5 dwarfs is bad as humans are just better healers and always was this way in top eu/us guilds in vanilla, they all knew about racial you are not discovering wheel 15 years later and we made decisions based on what you call now min max that 2-3 dwarfs is enough since rest should be humans. Nobody says that if someone is as insecure as you are and wants a free pass based on racial and guaranteed guild spot they shouldnt, in fact you should if you know you will be mediocre in other areas, just dont drag us down with you
---
The Blizzard survey also confirms this, as does census data from 2005, as does Pserver census data.
---
This was on a PvP realm. Once while leveling in Un'goro crater an undead warlock was struggling with some of those fire elementals near the middle of the map on that volcano must have pulled one too many mobs, because he was running away and wasn't looking where he was going and pulled a couple more, there was another horde nearby but couldn't care less and went on his way. I stopped and helped kill the elementals saving this undead from his certain death he nodded at me and we went our separate ways. Not too long after maybe 4 days later I find him again there with 2 other horde buddies and we are just killing stuff minding our own business (I was pretty sure when I saw them one of them was going to gank me but I guess he must have said them I was good) I finished what I needed to do /wave'd to him and his buddies and left to continue my questing.  
---
I hope when classic launches I can befriend some more horde like this, I will fight when attacked but horde or alliance if you are about to die I got your back.
---
I love the Documentary Now spoof 'DRONEZ'
---
I don't care about free retail for my Classic sub. You can keep it.
---
No pizza for me, i'm not from USA. :(
---
This I can't speak to. I played alliance on my first toon but I was a priest. Given their strength in bgs, I'm sure pallys have some great battle healer specs.
---
Yes,  both the "dps" racials are excellent for PvE, and then you have the stun resist which is great for PvP and decent for PvE.
---
Then again if you tank, bloodfury suck, since it reduces healing effects.
---
Go Orc if you want tp DPS/PvP.
---
Undead for PvP is also good.
---
Troll is good overall and great for tanking (arguably the best Threat per second in the game).
---
Tauren is great for tanking since they get 5% extra health, and the stun is also very good overall.
---
Ofc. Its a dream.
---
Savory Deviate Delight pirate wenches.
---
Haha I'm in the same boat, babys in bed at 8pm, I play until about 1am with my wife and then get merc'd by my baby waking up at 7 or 8am
---
I love how i get downvoted when nothing i said was wrong lmao
---
In pvp preception is the only relevant racial to rogues, which would help you in detecting other stealth characters. Every other alliance race would have more useful racials in pvp.
---
Interesting, not at all what I expected
---
even then there were things that didn't punish really horrid play.
---
As a warrior tank main, I want to love a tank who can heal and buff in raids. But, I just can’t get behind it. From 10 to 20, you just spam one button. And it’s another few levels until you get a finisher for Cat Form. Imagine playing a Rogue to 24 with only Sonister Strike. By that point, I was done. Experiment over.
---
If dps takes too much avoidable damage I wont prioritize healing them even if they're like 10% hp.
---
Is that passive aggressive enough?
---
I sure hope so, I have always played healers in games where it's an available role, and I never understood why the mentality was always DPS DPS DPS. I'd rather healbot a nasty warrior, and its true that everyone loves a good healer. That said, shaman back then were always a fools gold situation, unbreakable didn't help that. Shadow priests, on the other hand, were called The Beast for a reason.
---
No, it's almost 2 hours just to watch all the related videos.
---
depends you have good amount of hp with blues and the basic spell dmg deals a good amount of dmg. ele is easier to gear in raids (except everything other caster can roll on) then a mage because competetion is a lot higher and you have shared loot with a good amount of other casters. with ele on the ther hand you dont have much loot competetion with other casters except other ele (not talking abou the necklaces and trinkets which you probably dont have a chance to get early as ele).
---
Yep people forget that retail still has lots of usage of cc, at least past a certain point.
---
I guess it depends on what you prefer. If trying to be a part of that launch feeling and trying content is important to you, it may well be worth it to optimise your time. 
---
I'm personally not trying to optimise my leveling route, as I want to enjoy leveling this time around - but that's because I usually just want to get it over with - it might be the opposite for you. 
---
I think the perfect balance of play time lies somewhere between as much as you would want, and as much as is optimal for the rest of your life. That way you have that urge to play some more, and at the same time you feel that feeling of "I chose to play now instead of XX, that's nice!". It keeps your daily life functioning and the thrill there :)
---
It's a 3D print made with PLA plastic and acrylic paint
---
That is a surprisingly verbose crystal ball O_o
---
Interesting, thank you for the explanation, So basically the meta could change depending on whether or not there is development in the game? Say for example introducing a new and better axe?
---
Being a male and rolling a female is creepy, IMO.
---
Any caster. I dont like there being a delay between almost all of my damaging spells.
---
Yea totaly agree. Nice to see some people can see that.
---
One could hope, but all the people who made the games that were great isn't there anymore, and will the new people follow the old guys ways.
---
This is a giant eagle of text that does not actually say or convey any real meaning b
---
Executie
---
I'm a male planning to main a female character because I'd rather stare at their ass for the better part of the next two years.
---
I completely agree, I’m almost through the frozen throne and it’s so good. I had to torrent it though, you can’t even buy the regular version right now.
---
More like 30-50% of the damage
---
Lol no.
---
I thought i have to write ANOTHER thread but you have taken care of this already, thanks :D
---
is there anyway you can make some with only using that class' abilities? ik it wouldn't look as perfect but itd still be cool looking to me i think.
---
You know, I actually really like that idea. Might incorporate it into all my professions. Try to stay at my lvlx5, and distribute the skillups at roughly 5 per level.
---
Male Troll, i will be smokeing weed like a industrial chimney however not part of roleplay. I am not really a roleplayer, ive never been one to play with dolls or  assume the roles of  another character/persona except myself.   
---
Why troll Male? I like the animation. And the racials are good, no matter the class.
---
Sure if your illiterate or too incompetent to understand ideas that contradict your own.
---
/r/ScriptedClassicGifs
---
I remember them going for 15s in vanilla, bought a lot of them to sell for twink gear
---
I guess that's an example of tone and context not transferring over text :)
---
Honestly I'd prolly go double gathering proffs and bank the cloth you get, being able to buy a mount easily while leveling due to vendoring skins/boes (if you don't pick up enchanting to de them, since you only need to have enchanting to DE anything) is really good, though since 6 slot bags will be pretty rare on live, maybe taking tailoring isn't a bad idea either. But any proffs that are gold sinks I'd avoid while leveling.
---
the only way you can really fuck up in my eyes as a healer is if you're that guy that asks for a mana break after every pull. bonus points if you type out "need mana break" while you're just standing there not even drinking
---
healing in vanilla is almost as braindead of a mechanic as most dps rotations
---
In the little bit I've looked into it I haven't heard of it being patched out but I also haven't looked over all the patch notes so take it with a grain of salt.
---
You forgot to mention that druids and fury tanks will be BELLOW prot warrios, as it was in VANILLA.
---
Thanks! It's actually the reason I uninstalled it the other day. I'll grab it again for later.
---
Using engi items instead of that little racial is more effective in the time you’re stuck, but believe what you want
---
Most people are going skinning to vendor the skins or to farm devilsaur leather, either way it's going to be a pretty flooded market for most stuff.
---
Theresa.....is that you!?
---
No it doesn't.
---
was gonna say this. each race seems to fit each spec perfectly. ele troll, axe swinging orc, and a healing tauren
---
Oh no! I accidentally looked at the butt of my Tauren! He's male, so I guess that makes me gay now! God, I gotta reroll to a female immediately. /s
---
Because they got glad on retail.
---
It proves your point only if you think retail is some kind of godly server where you instantly progress a lot more than on pserv (spoiler: it's not, people who play on pserv and retail are the same)
---
Did you test that on the beta?
---
Lol
---
Tell him to go watch some Kenion videos lol.
---
how are shadow priest in pvp? what are they strong against weak against? I might play one.
---
Mine was Diet Coke lol. At this time i didn’t really even have a guild. I was just soloing around and exploring late at night. Something about being up super late in the stillness of the night while also being super connected in this online world was so fascinating to me!!!
---
Never played any of the cloth wearers.
---
Yes. And it never worked like that in Vanilla either.
---
Paladins. How fucking narrow minded do you have to be to enforce the will of your faith on someone else and the punishments your club created?  
---
Worst thing I could imagine for gameplay. Low apm puts me to sleep and that the last thing I want when I'm playing a videogame.  
---
The fantasy is the antithesis of my theology; none. Weaponizing christianity is the opposite of what I consider to be a fun time. Keep in mind that during classic priests and paladins, as religious zealots, pre-date the restructuring of things resulted from the World of Warcraft: Chronicle. Priests are much more tolerable because their eagerness to make you a victim of their god-complex is less than a Paladin's.
---
What makes you think phases are spread out evenly?
---
Make do....
---
Futa elf.
---
Nah.  The healer is too busy being a ClassicThot and won't stop DMing the low tier players in the servers top guilds to heal.
---
Great app, works fine!
---
I will vouch for the rotation suggestion.
---
Lol what he said... I remember some of our warriors wearing leather for their hit to get 9% for BWL and AQ.  Special attack misses is why I went arms since you needed way less hit... that and the guild usually PVP'd after raids where arms burst was amazing.
---
You are a dense one. Achievements done on retail does not validate the gameplay of vanilla to be somehow equal in difficulty. Players who like pvp do pvp. You suggesting every private server hero gets a free glad on retail? I’m guessing you are, which is just asinine. Either way, vanilla pvp is still way simpler and slower, which is a good thing. Moving on.
---
I'm actually pretty literate. Did I convey any ideas on the subject? Did I say loot council or any other system of loot distribution was better than any other system? No. I just said that your giant wall of text did not convey any ideas in a coherent organized manner. 
---
The worst kind of stupid person is someone that thinks they are smart, but in actuality they aren't smart enough to comprehend how little they actually know. They tend to overcome their ignorance by pontificating in a voluminous and unorganized way. We called it word boarding in the Army. They think that the sheer volume of text will wear you down and that people will concede out of sheer frustration. This is what you are trying to do and people have already pointed out that you basically aren't saying anything constructive or meaningful.

Crater? Like that circle pit in front of where they put the bg masters?

Oh no! They sent me a poster of a muscular dude in a speedo rather than the girl in a bikini, I guess I'll hang it on my wall anyway. /s

Yes, the formula arrives at 8% because it doesn't take into account the extra +1% needed because of the modifier.
---
At 300 skill, the hitcap is 9%.
---
At 305 skill, the hitcap is 6%.
---
Dumbass.

Female only.

That is leveling a rogue. Everything else is just a waste of time.

Yeah its gonna be weird with the EoS since priests cant get Benediction till phase 2 cause Kazzak...

I have a 6 month old son, he sleeps at around 730pm and whenever he wakes up wife usually takes care of him since it’s usually because he is hungry, try and get your baby in a sleep schedule that leaves you with a few hours of playtime, I also have a soon to be 2 year old daughter that sleeps at 715 and we got her used to sleeping through the night till 6am so I’ll have plenty of time to play from 730 to 12.
---
Male of course, I’m not one of those guys that play as a female.

This is literally some /r/iamverysmart shit.
---
&gt; We called it word boarding in the Army and I see it all the time in the Court room from lawyers that either do t know the law or have a losing argument.
---
Ahahhahhahaaha
---
The fact you think I give a fuck that you're probably some fucking butter bar that just got out of OCS is actually fucking hilarious. Just for your information, I'm an enlisted Marine vet that fought in OIF. I couldn't respect you less if I tried. So absolutely fucking pathetic when I see people like you on try to toss around the fact you're a service member as if that's suppose to command some additional level of respect. Sincerely, fuck off. 
---
Let break it down for you Barney style smart guy:
---
&gt; It's really just the same symptom of the same problem that many gamers and just many people in general have. It's the same reason why when you get ganked on bot lane it's your jungle's or support's fault. It's the same reason why when you lose an overwatch game it's because X person on your team was bad. It's the same reason why when you get shot in the face in counterstrike that guy is obviously a smurf.
---
Gamers have egos.
---
&gt; Many people are incapable of objectively looking at themselves and saying maybe this didn't go my way because of someing I did. It's not me, it's everyone elses fault.
---
Gamers have a hard time setting aside their egos
---
&gt; The same thing is applied to loot council when somebody is super heated about a decision because they think they deserved it way more. Instead of realizing that maybe the other person deserved that piece more or even just accepting the fact that sometimes any of even 3 or 4 people is all a correct call for that piece of loot they call corruption because it's easier to shift blame to somebody else than look at yourself and say you could have done more to make yourself a better candidate for that upgrade.
---
The same gamer ego mentality that infects other games comes into play often when justifying their anger with loot council decisions. 
---
Still too much word boarding for you?
---
“I just pulled some numbers out of my ass that my own source says aren’t true” 
---
It even says 8% hit explicitly if one reads the link.
---
First of all it's nostalgia. Cause i do believe there is better games out there. However i will never have the energy, nor the time to invest myself into it as i have in WoW. I watched my brother play Warcraft 2, i played Warcraft 3 + Frozen Throne. I played the custom game Azeroth Wars, with the whole of Azeroth as a battleground with all the different factions. I was introduced to the whole idea of an MMORPG with WoW, it was massive, neverending and unbelievably vast both in term of people and experiences. The idea of reliving the days of my youth (yes it's basically a midlife crisis for me this.), is very tempting. And much like Heroes of Might and Magic 3, AOE2 and CS 1.6. These games just lives forever.
---
Secondly, it felt like you achieved something in classic just by logging on. (Seems silly when comparing to retail where you are the biggest and baddest boss around killing gods.) But in classic i felt a sense of achievement just by lvling up characters (which took effort, and planning.) It was slow and tedious, but that was the reason why it was an achievement in itself. Mixed with my interest in WoW lore (I read the original lore, without the Eredar/Draenei rewritten.) Must say i liked the original better. Fuck the space donkeys... (like seriously, spaceships in Warcraft... this is NOT Starcraft for christ sake.)
---
Thirdly... You could find your own way, questing, Raiding, PvP or just enjoying the events surrounding the holidays.
---
My old lady also plays a fem toon in wow. That said, she loves FPS and the guys in those games sometimes get weird (she uses voice chat, she knows some girls who don't use VC for that reason). It took her 3 months of hardcore Apex legends grinding before she ever met another girl in voice chat.

Came to see this comment
---
I can only play a few but the only class I can’t play at all is shaman.

God left.

---
&gt; This means that the so-called “hit cap” is in effect 9% rather than 8% for a player with 300 Weapon Skill fighting a level 63 monster with a Defense Skill of 315.
---
And those formulas are available from every wiki. Learn to google.
---
Not players anyways, some of the npcs do.

Bare with me; Jagex littered Runescape (original) with micro transactions, and their player base has dropped significantly. Now 2007scape has low key become their main game, despite having a fraction of the team Runescape has. It must be  embarrassing to just think about for any employee that works at Runescape. Jagex promised to never put any micro transactions into 2007scape, and fast forward 6 years, the company is salivating at the thought of putting Microtransactions into 2007scape, and the 07scape department is fighting to resist it.
---
Now, Blizzard (Activision) will be under the same situation in a couple years. I want to say classic WoW will never get ruined, but it’s just so hard to stay optimistic when you look back at what Activision has done to Blizzard and the integrity of their franchises in the last few years and all these big names leaving Blizzard.
---
I like how everyone mocks hunters for needing on dalrend but they would also need on blackcrow without a blink...
---
That's true, but may be redundant depending on your setup. You should have muscle memory to know that button activates Bear Form, and you won't need to look at the icon. You'd rather know the cooldown on Enrage even outside of Bear Form. This is doubly true if you have another hotkey dedicated to only transforming; then the only significant thing about the Enrage key is that it Enrages, and /use !Bear Form is more quality of life than function.
---
Yeah I really can't imagine anyone enjoying a pug dungeon route to 60, can't really imagine anyone trying that either, but I personally am going in with folks I know from a pserver, all of us hit 60 around the same time, and our schedules line up, but yeah it might be pretty unlikely many people will find that.
---
I’m planning on rolling hunter and I can’t really see what you mean but I understand if you are just going off of combat while leveling and trying to keep your pet happy
---
Yeah I wouldn't try and get into a discussion with this person. That at the end was so passive aggressive and toxic it makes me feel bad for the guy.
---
I'm sorry if you thought I was talking about vanilla, it makes sense since we're on r/classicwow but imo vanilla is absolute garbage about PvP and no one looking for competitive PvP should go there. I was talking about tbc / tlk pserv mostly. I didn't say that just because you're good on pserv you can get glad on retail, I said that I know pserv players who are / were retail glad

The video from Kevin Jordan you're referencing does not say they thought world buff stacking was a mistake because they ended up being too strong. He specifically says they thought world buff stacking was a mistake because of the work/effort involved in collecting them all.
---
No but gaining threat on multiple targets is a lot easier
---
Yeah I used to play eve online which is the biggest sausage fest mmo you'll ever play (takes a special kinda lady to enjoy cutthroat pvp).  It always caused a bit of a doubletake when there was a clearly female voice speaking in teamspeak, doubly so if they were actually an officer giving fleet commands.

Though i must say for being a game populated by so many neckbeards people didn't get too weird about it.

Do that cast to get out of a spell instead of using engi to stun them or other cc, that’s what the genius’ choose...

That’s not passive aggressive that’s just smart

And you're have to be an actual unironic huntard to try and get Dal'Rends just for 0.1% extra crit.

Those notes are not from Blizzard, you won't find them anywhere in released Vanilla patches.

Totems never had a 40 yard radius in Vanilla.
---
Totems should not have had a 40 yard radius on any Private Server.
---
Totems will not ever have a 40 yard radius in Classic.

It would be awesome if you could do some of the legends of vanilla, people we are aspiring to be come classic!

I believe in you

If gigantic companies had tighter regulation and as a result less incentive to chase infinite growth, it might feel this sort of behavior in. As Steve Jobs famously used to say, companies that get large off the popularity of a well designed product often shift their focus to milking money off that product vs continuing to build great products. If we rewind back to 2008 and Blizzard's focus continued to be "make incredible games that can sustain our workforce" rather than "milk our popularity and grow grow grow", they'd be in a better place. Of course, the Activision merger was the landmark moment we all point to where this shift in focus occurred
---
I have never since release heard someone call world buff collecting an exploit, not a single person I knew even gave a second thought that it wasnt working as intended.
---
I'm not saying it'll be easier but they'll also be a ton of mages who will also fight for spellpower against warlocks. Rogues have to fight with multiple classes for even their leather. I think druids and hunters are about the only couple that get it easy.
---
Tremor Totem did. None of the others did.
---
Really? odd
---
There isn't a single 2-handed weapon that drops from raids that is PVE BIS for Warriors you idiot.

And you can use every single one of your engineering items and still be caught in a frost nova or entangling roots.

Nope, not really.

Honestly, the key to maining a druid was picking druid and getting to 60 before you realized you were in an abusive relationship and there were other fish in the sea.

I guess they got screwed by Diablo 4 not being ready for presentation. They kept hyping up "new Diablo projects" and it built up to critical mass and when they couldn't get it ready in time for the prime time slot at Blizzcon, they were essentially left between an expected HS expansion, an expected OW new character, an expected update on Classic, the remake of a 18 year old game, and the only new announcement of a new game (Diablo Immortal). Still a bad idea, but one is left to wonder: how actually unprepared were they for Diablo 4, given there STILL isn't an announcement 9 months later?
---
Skull primary.
---
Cross secondary.
---
Moon = Sheep
---
Blue Square = Trap
---
Star = Sap
---
Triangle = Sleep / Hex
---
Diamond = Warlock target (Void tanking / Banish / Seduce . Fear)
---
If you just have to snare something/multiple targets and frostshock/earthbind on cool-down
---
You and I play Rogue very differently.
---
Everyone is telling you warrior, but you do need to ask yourself if you are comfortable tanking.  It's the hardest job in the game and if you aren't up for it you should consider mage.
---
must've got lost on its way to me
---
I mained druid through every expansion, and yeah...I'd try to enjoy chicken, but always switch back quickly.

I remember running around AB with full +Nature damage greens on my hunter back in the day, blowing people up every six seconds with arcane shot, but I remember by the time the BC pre-patch was out, it wasn't a think anymore. 
---
It was hilarious, so I'm hoping you're right.
---
Sick thanks for the explanation. I like how there's still new stuff to learn after all these years
---
First and foremost, thank you for putting this together! I am currently downloading and installing the app and look forward to using it shortly!
---
Many of the concepts and situations in classic wow are far too mature oriented (poisoning people, slaughtering entire villages, etc.) For this reason I would not recommend playing with your 7 month old.
---
No it's not.

People always talk about how easy Hunter and Warlock is for new players - but fail to understand that a lack of discipline in regards to pets results in more wipes than any other single factor.
---
It's not gay unless you touch tips
---
Warlock alt leveling with an AH bought set of +shadow greens is a beautiful thing, I gotta tell you. You just run around chucking instant dots on anything that's red. You end up spending more time looting than fighting, because everything runs away to die.
---
For real, though, it's going to be torture to be a healer when Classic goes live.  Tanks are going to pull way too much shit and DPS isn't going to follow marks.
---
I like that a lot better than the random talent calc app I had downloaded previously. That old app has been uninstalled and now I am using yours!
---
Paul Stanley owes so much to South Park
---
Fair enough! All very valid points. :)
---
They might make it shorter depending on their future plans, but I wouldn't mind a 3 month phase 1, makes leveling an alt a possibility due to like 99% reduced ganking in p1.
---
Here's hoping! My friend is trying to write code to do some GBank stuff and he'd love to stop I'm sure lol
---
These days a healer should be positioning himself so that you basically never notice him drinking, or at most have to wait once a dungeon.
---
I doubt it. He's retiring, not moving elsewhere. He wants to enjoy his 50's and 60's. And he still owns a ton of stock. He has no reason to discuss any internal information or politics of the company.
---
It’ll happen in Classic the the way people did this in Vanilla was by simply not inviting someone of the same armor type or class to the run to ensure they’re rolling on the item unapposed. Now people are just upfront about it so expect to see a lot of “LFM UBRS Truestrike res NEED KEY”
---
I just saw similarities in the sentence structure and word complexity. 
---
How do you know where I get my political news/information?? Are you a part of this FaceId spyware??
---
People just wouldn’t invite you if you needed the item(s). Now they’ll just say X is on res
---
I remember it fondly. I even faked that I was sick from work to play all day long occasionally. And I must admit I spent at least half the workday at work reading about wow on forums and other sites. Had an office back then so no one could see what I was doing.
---
How TRULY useful is the stun resist in PvP? I know everyone says it's amazing and 1/3 stuns is nothing to scoff at but at the end of the day you're relying on chance. That worries me, you know?
---
One I'd like to add is when tanking, face the mob so it's back is against the group. I've heard this has a big impact on its fleeing path. 
---
Also if rogues and druids are present, this allows em to backstab easier
---
wish less people did CAPS for every other word to make a point, it's not really necessary.
---
not really, a great healer doesnt make the group wait for him to drink,  drinking often is part of that, you should always have at least a stack of water and drink anytime you arent in combat and not above 80% mana.
---
It is a little tough. I don't own any apple products and so it would be a decent investment to start developing for iOS. :(

Fuck your weapon skill go to Blasted Lands for that 😤😤😤

Bag drops have got to be buffed on pservers. I didn't play the beta but I remember bags being super rare, yet every pserver I play I have  6 before I leave senjin village.

If you step out of bear form as a druid to heal yourself you'll probably get mulched. You're like a way squishier rogue.

Cys Male. All the way.

I like shammy. Too bad theyre gonna be so overplayed as a class for horde
---
We have a galaxy brain at work here.
---
Are these constant Hunter weapon memes making anyone else feel like they should just never group with a hunter?
---
lots of stuff is different, but I'm pretty sure the world record for /played might be close to that, the pserver record on silverhand was like 2.5 days or something, and I heard it had to do with logging out between each mobspawn cycle and having a raid group to help, idk how much of it is true.
---
Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold, that's why I got a heater for your thighs

Hmmm maybe yea. 100k is a little less than my yearly salary. I would take that.

&gt; Also Barbarous Blade will not be available until phase 2
---
We're talking about phase 2, here. Read the comment chain before replying.
---
My point is that going for a very rare drop weapon pairing, on top of taking it away from melee who will actually use it, just for an absolutely tiny, completely unnoticeable amount of extra crit, is flat-out retarded.
---
&gt;No warrior/rogue is going to use rend's weapons once viskags start dropping
---
Bad argument.
---
Oh shit! I've been using this and didnt realize it was yours. It's very good, my favorite for personal use. Superior to wowhead and classicdb, the only downside is not being able to link builds with it. But really, I'm not doing that often and when I do I can just go on classicdb. Great work, thank you!
---
Can't agree more. I played healer in vanilla, BC and then again in WoD. Rerolled after my first mythic dungeons as it was only pure stress healing there while in early WoW playing healer was a great way to have fun and make friends without thinking too much. On the plus side, tank became way easier to play than it used to be in vanilla ;)
---
I played a lot when my oldest was a baby. But the boy had a mother so.

NS healing touch and barkskin, shift back, no problem.

"bodybuilding" he calls it...

Is the plural form of shaman shamans or shaman.
---
does anybody know if spell damage is going to scale with weapon procs? I've seen some posts about shaman being viable dps for raids if they gear for more spell damage and focus on shocks instead of strictly WF
---
lmao hey we were human once too :)
---
Elfs on the other hand...
---
Yea def weird to make it a mandate for MC for a casual guild. If you’re pushing server firsts..sure that’s chill. Other than that, I wouldn’t personally start spending massive resources on flasks and pots until BWL at the earliest.
---
Crying bullshit. I started on '05 and it was all Chuck.
---
I don’t know why you were downvoted. Classic WoW has a completely different API than Vanilla WoW. Not every addon, but pretty much 95% of addons from Vanilla won’t work. The only addons that I know work on Classic that are from Vanilla are OmniCC and Abar/AttackBar. And OmniCC won’t be needed since it’s built into the interface options now.
---
Gotta love vanish/feign death/self heals
---
Not gonna lie, I won both as a hunter in vanilla and then put demonslaying on them to help with rok and look quest
---
&gt;Shadowform cost 574mana, that is more than 10%. And heals are not cheap in mana either. A flash heal and renew is 750 mana together.
---
Why would DPS go out of DPS form to heal? That's what healers are for.
---
Priests, I could never get into them no matter how many times I tried. Never got one past 20. That lowbie kit is too healing focused and so boring and healing dungeons to level puts me to sleep.
---
BigCritties is a terrible name for a male paladin.
---
Male,

 still hope that male orcs get the good posture option
---
Anyone who levels holy is a true masochist.  
---
The SP jerking on reddit so much worse than any other class imo. Everyone seems to think it's going to be an easy journey gearing up and raiding at 60 (like mage). A lot of dungeon groups are not even going to invite you. They rather waith for a 2nd hunter a lot of times. Stupid in my opinion tho.
---
You can’t get behind Rogue because Rogue gets behind you.
---
They are so good we would give ashkandi to pvp off spec warriors before hunters just because dalrends + enchants are a side grade even compared to Nef loot.
---
They won't. You have fanatics here claiming they'd shell out insane amounts of cash just to play Classic.
---
I was just trying to provide some input for OP - I'm fully aware that I'll probably be far from the last to reach 60 - in case it was me and not OP you wanted to reassure ;)
---
Still have to set up my new pc. Might get around to it this weekend.

Last time I was on, I saw lvl 1s riding around in motorcycles. So it would seem you get your first mount at lvl 1.
---
The problem with iOS is that every app is reviewed by Apple before it can go onto the App Store, and one of the requirements is that the app developer has all legal rights (with proof) of all content it contains. Given Activision Blizzard owns all of the rights to WoW including talent trees, it would just get rejected.
---
I think he was questioning why the dragon didn't de-spawn after a certain proximity from the spawn location. This mob was obviously exempt from that, at least when this was made. 
---
This video pre-dated my WoW career by several months.
---
It just makes you the healer version of the "YoU pUlL iT yOu TaNk iT" guy and that guy is retarded.
---
What a retarded troll this guy is, probably a heteroinsectual. (has a bug fetish)
---
Healing as little as possible while keeping the party safe and maximizing your mana regen while wanding as much as possible is what good healing is all about
---
&gt; before ZG and the 16slot debuff opens up 
---
We don't know yet but it sounded on Blizzard that will have 16 debuff slots at launch.
---
Sure you're not a hunter?
---
Layering is not meant to help with mob tagging or crowding issues. You need to re-read the Blue post. 
---
The current implementation of layering could be changed to prompt players to choose layer after picking server, then locking players to that layer, exactly like you were locked to server in 2004. That would allow friends and guilds to self organize and still preserve immersion.
---
Allowing layer hopping is unnecessary and most importantly, destroys the very fabric of the game.

"The owls are not what they seem"

Yeah... actually just been putting my phone on airplain mode and placing it under my pillow with a vibrating alarm lately

Precisely.
---
Don’t worry, we can laugh at all of them for their poor choices!
---
Have fun doing ubrs without a hunter
---
I don't know, just grinds my gears that people who hate healing is going to roll the most iconic healing class.  
---
Same as people selling make up and skin cream who wear a white lab coat to make them seem more legit and "science based".
---
I mean people didn't care about the fact that it was a mobile game. They cared because that's the sole new big thing that was announced that isn't a remake. They just had to make a " but just one more thing " as if it was E3 and make a big screen " HEY BTW DIABLO 4 SOON FOR YOU GUYS " and it wasn't a complete disaster. I don't get how people making these conference didn't anticipate the epic backlash from that. Or they didn't care because they knew that china would give them shit tons of money anyway.

Lmao, I think **I** found a virgin. Be a fucking man, your wife doesn't get to tell you when you sleep.

This is actually pretty good lmao
---
To the guilds that can actually use world buffs the content is already trivial easy, you don't spend the time to get the buffs if you know you might wipe on the first boss.
---
Yeah, that's called ninja looting. When you roll need on something you don't need to equip.
---
They have

Well there's a helmet that has 3 armor and is cloth that looks like a jackolantern that I'm really hoping is in classic but I think it came out later.
---
We did UBRS without kiting Drak back in vanilla.

Why?
---
Then don't play it
---
Conveniently, if you want it for it's gold value, there is a [picture of gold that you can click on to indicate such.](https://i.imgur.com/GzgQjvk.jpg)
---
I agree on shaman. They are (largely) passive buff bots with weaker healing than a priest or paladin. They don't really do anything special. Not saying they aren't useful, they are. But they don't seem very well designed compared to the rest. I know, because I played one for a year in classic, and was not happy. 
---
Druid is close, but at least feral is sort of viable. Enhance and Ele are just largely a joke.
---
Go with your heart. That said, hunters have very specific jobs to do in PVE, and have a very high skill ceiling in PVP. The two classes are very different. If you don't like to heal and are only willing to do it grudgingly, don't roll shaman. Gearing sucks for everybody who isn't the MT.
---
Best days. Sounds like my school days when I moved to the city at 16. It's the best.
---
Ashkandi is BiS for melee weaving though :(
---
Pets don't have a taunt they have a glorified high threat move. They don't snap aggro

Why would you pass instead of rolling greed?

That's why you dont skip raids

Boss drop rates are pretty spot on but everything else is a bit dodgy but still close enough for what it is.

And a bonus in the context of whether or not it can be considered an exploit:
---
&gt; Did we expect people to go out and collect buffs?
---
&gt; [Yeah, we kinda did](https://www.twitch.tv/kevinjordan/clip/InexpensiveAmericanGoshawkOhMyDog?filter=clips&amp;range=30d&amp;sort=time)
---
That what is write under a lot of addons on willitclassic "didn't get access to beta so i can't test properly"
---
Was this guild a transfer of Vis Maior from Everquest?
---
Counting down the days will only make it seem longer.
---
You are the tank. You have tank privilege, use it. DPS are a dime a dozen, if you are big dick tonk and know what you are doing, you are much much harder to replace and healers/clothes won't give a shit about the huntard+rogue QQ'ing about truestrike. You just get yours fam.
---
I think confidence is a huge part that makes a tank as well... never forget, they need you way more than you need them... DPS come a dime a dozen.
---
Not a tank, but a healer - I'm already looking forward to letting over-eager DPS / annoying people die...
---
&gt;affected by fear again
---
The same one or do you recast it?
---
none of us did
---
Step 1: be a Paladin
---
Step 2: don't not be a Paladin.
---
Nope I'm a healer, unless that person takes all of your mana or gcds to keep alive and the rest of your group dies as a result its always worth to keep them alive.
---
I just don't have the special snowflake attitude that some healers and tanks get.
---
As a Prot Warrior, I fully support anyone who says, "You pull it, you tank it." It gets pretty bad sometimes, and it's quite frustrating to manage some offenders. So, let them die and let them learn.
---

---
I think it's actually Paladins who down rank the least. I'm sure some more serious players will chime in on this but speaking for shaman, it's all down ranking. Priests definitely down rank as well.
---
I plan on tanking. If a DPS pulls I'm going to tell the healer to let him die.
---
It's a weird catch 22. The old "tough" raids felt better BECAUSE not everyone completed them. It gave you something to work toward, to see that content. Now anyone can see all the content in like 2 hours through lfr. So then the challenge is "removed" because you dont have to struggle to see it. And this kills some of the appeal. 
---
But at the same time why should they only create content where only 10% of the playerbase sees it? I feel had they taken more of the vanilla approach of adding dungeons to boost gear to let people just overpower their way through last content patches stuff would of been a better more organic option but /shrug
---
Finishing the full house remodel! Have done all the internals, and taken a chainsaw to a few trees and cleaned up the yard nicely, last is the outside and I will start on that next weekend, and finish it by release.
---
One small couple day vacation in the middle of there with the family before kids start school again. Happy kids, happy wife, happy life.
---
I always had Star = sheep :D
---
that never ever happens in deadmines
---
in that one room
---
you know the one
---
Using lower ranks cost less mana, and in vanilla there were addons that automatically would pick the optimal spell rank, but lazy scripts are not going to work in classic so now you need to pick the rank yourself.
---
Good to know! Thanks. I'm typically a druid or shaman player but the appeal of dorf priests in raids is hard to pass up.
---
You can have a rogue kiting no problem.
---
Shamen
---
Sorry but my mount is more valuable to me than this lvl 39 twink weapon is worth to you
---
Yes I believe so.
---
Agreed with the other guy who replied back to this. Though I guess I moreso meant exclusive rather than tough. In my mind and a lot of friends who had quit, we hated the idea of "heroic" and "mythic" raids, there was no fun in killing stuff you'd already killed. It just felt like lazy ass game design really. I get why they put it in, but in my mind it was one of the things which helped bring the apparent downfall of the game. And no, I didn't clear naxx in 2006...I got a fair few bosses down, and was fine with that. KT was an exclusive club reserved for the 1337 and the guys we wanted to work towards being. I will admit however that times have massively changed and people are a lot more conditioned with add-ons and knowledge now, so maybe I am looking at things with rose tinted glasses and it will be easier this time round...we shall see I guess
---
when you're attacking what the tank's attacking, it's impossible to pull anything
---
&gt; Were world buffs designed to be used all at once?
---
&gt; Yes. Though we discovered that was kind of a mistake. It was just too much, ya know? People can't turn down even the slightest advantage when it comes to progressing through difficult content. So it established this feeling that you had to have all of the buffs before you could even start. And collecting all of the buffs was just too much. It was too much work.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/440538861?t=0h21m14s
---
Not a single word on them being too powerful or imbalanced.
---
I used low rank spells even on TBC, its just mana menagment, depending on fight, composition etc i guess its must on Classic.
---
These posts right here, Inquisitor.
---
Takes forever to get gear on a shaman.   Took me a year just to get t1, and by then it wasn't even particularly useful.
---
Getting gear on a hunter and druid is ez.
---
Standard procedure
---
next time my healer sits down after nine pulls
---
bang
---
Are there examples of situations that would require using the mouse + turn key method to strafe rather than the bound strafe key, or are you saying either/or? Couldn't think of any but I don't play atm.
---
Just curious because I'm minmaxing a little more with my keybinds this time around.
---
&gt;gain rep and get exalted around or before 40
---
You aren't going to be anywhere near exalted even at 60 even if you did every single night elf quest available.
---
Hopefully! This sort of thing was creatively hilarious. I'm unsure if there was a range limit implemented before 1.12, fingers crossed this is still feasible though!
---
No, because someone might legitimately want to use them. That's the whole point. Boes are not just for selling, which is clearly where you're coming from. But ultimately they ARE for using because people **buy them to use**, which is the point that you can't seem to grasp.
---
Being a ninja is not the answer.
---
they feel immense pressure from the way the dps is spastically zipping around and jumping in place
---
You're right you'd die if you just popped out and tried healing mid combat. So you HoT before, it gives additional threat and let's the healer keep drinking for a bit.
---
Sereious question. Anyone ever jerked off to this?
---
pvp
---
Emergency bear: for those times when you have to immediately blow Tranquility at the pull, and you'd appreciate a few moments of quiet contemplation before you're given the option to release.
---
You wont even be able to get exalted at lvl 60 without the cloth turn ins
---
Pfft, *you* might not use World Buffs, but plenty of people in your guild will.
---
'positioning'?
---
so...the healer creeps behind a pile of rubble and drinks alone, got it
---
&gt; Edit: This was downvoted? For real? this community.... 
---
Your post have the lowerst approval rating I have seen so far. 9%, that's impressive. Basically no one agree with you.
---
It is possibe watch staysafe's video he did one on this subject and with human racial to gain 10% more rep it can be done
---
Again your reading comprehension is not very good. At no point did I say I am right because I was in the Army, nor did I mention my rank which definitely wasn't an Officer. I was relaying context behind the phrase as to it's origin. Notice how I also applied it to my experience in the Court room as applying to people that know they have a losing argument. Context was needed because that type of phrase would generally not originate from attorneys without a military background. 
---
It's funny that you mock me for mentioning that I was in the Army to get brownie points from you and then you mentioned that you are enlisted in the Marine. Pot meet kettle you are both black.
---
People usually project their own shortfalls onto other people, so most likely you are the worst kind of Vet. The kind that throws that fact out like people actually give a fuck. They dont give a shit if you were a marine, enlisted, or in OIF/OEF cause none of that shit matters.
---
You equate not liking a system because you think they are undeserving and if only they were superior, like you, then they would see how the system is perfect. However, you completely overlook other people legitimate complaints about the system. You add no constructive voice to the discussion. Only contempt for those that don't agree with you misplaced sense of superiority.
---
It's not enough until the dps you're talking about is the one with the shield.
---
Nah hes probably getring ready to "no life it" on classic
---
This community is retarded sometimes
---
http://consoleport.net/home/
---
"what percent mana do you want to be at before the next pull?"
---
Mind posting the video?
---
founded*
---
and now that you're an adult, you get to ignore as many responsibilities as you want
---
It most definitely can not be done lol the video is 100% wrong.
---
He did it on a private server.  The rep values are inflated.  If you want the nightsaber it is still worth doing at low level to get a ton of rep although you'll have a hard time buying your skills as a mage
---
Wow saves
---
That image is the reason for my first char being an undead mage
---
Spoken like a true ninja
---
Staysafe's video is based on private server values and is completely wrong, but yeah you do you boo.
---
Honestly, trying to save everyone can easily result in a wipe, so when shit goes bad, who you can afford to let die is a real calculation you have to make. In a perfect world, this is a rare gaming event. In reality, the expendables have already declared themselves.
---
No don’t tell them that. We don’t need more tanks.

A Tank who loves instantly finding a group for anything and the whole group saying things along the lines of “OH THANK GOD” or “FINALLY”

Well, thank you - you've convinced me.  I'm rolling a shadow priest now.

Mages, sure. Not Rogues. No midget could kidney punch me hard enough to stun me for 5 seconds.

1. "Give me lead, me tank"
---
2. Kick said DPS
---
3. /s lol sorry misclick lmao
---
Thanks for that, I genuinely couldn't find it.
---
Seems like the difference is not dramatic.
---
Well, Rank 1 of Flash of Light is way more mana efficient than the max rank while still healing enough for dungeons or spot-healing in raids. Downranking as holy paladin is therefore mandatory aswell.
---
Depth and emergent gameplay rather than a series of carefully constructed theme park rides so overly polished and homogenized that they have lost all grit and character.
---
An overall pacing which is slower yet far more meaningful than modern game design conventions.
---
Real consequential player interaction that is driven by people and communities, not matchmaking algorithms.
---
And a healthy dose of nostalgia that helps me to see past all the little blemishes and imperfections to appreciate the above.

'minimize time'
---
lol play BFA if you're concerned about 'minimizing time'
---
Batching will always be abused because it's simply very easy to abuse. On the other hand, there's no easy way of removing batching-related crit-sitting.
---
Either they remove batching or crit-sitting stays in the game.
---
My future Night Elf Shadowpriest says, "Hi!"
---
Keep **‽** in the clipboard for this.
---
Vanilla was not perfect, and classic shouldn't be perfect. In vanilla people with play a NE just because they like the races, you can do the same in classic and make the priest work without having fear ward.
---
Wtf are you talking about, man. I have no idea who that was, I thought that was the OP. I'm not laughing *at* him, it's literally banter. : | I don't fucking care how I look in 50 years, I don't know if I will even still live by then - according to statistics I most likely will not.
---
Jesus fuck, man... This sub is ridiculous.
---
You can also dual wield 2x"Bone Slicing Hatchet" and enchant both with +agi. That's even better than Barberous Blade. The 2-hander agility enchant only comes out later if I remember correctly.
---
They are all very viable. and have different playstyles and strengths/weaknesses

&gt; So it comes down to being a human and said humans in the previous post and most of us throughout the world are greedy and we dont care about if you eat or starve.

Stop with this, this is healbot *continued*. The OG one was a "spam 1 button to heal" addon until blizzard removed that stuff.

Granted, it wasnt as bad as some addons that synced with the entire raid, but it *used* to heal for you.

They're brainwashed. Same people somehow believe a nation less than 350 years old is somehow God's Blessed Country and the world was just waiting for us to come around to do things the right way: in short they're fucking idiots.
---
The internet has set impossible expectations for Scotsmen.
---
While your at it, make all of my classes completely useless talents into good ones.
---
Hunter weapon
---
Yep. I hadn't been paying any attention to wow and a friend wanted me to play and said they needed "casters." I thought I was going to get a D&amp;D druid which is a full caster. Leveled balance and just didn't know any better. I thought healing was also going to be more of a spot-heal type thing, not something you actively did constantly in combat. Oh, and the main reason I picked that class was faerie fire in the instruction manual of all things.
---
Faces were melted that day
---
What bothers me is changes. How was it in 1.12? That's how it should be.
---
I want to play Vanilla again. That's the whole point of Classic. Especially for so many of us who didn't get to do everything they wanted to do, before TBC.
---
And to play Vanilla again, means exactly as it was, before it *wasn't*.
---
Please don't confuse me as a "buff-stacker". I'm not going to be getting them. Consumables yes, especially as a tank. And Ony head, when possible. But even that's not dependable, as it can only be turned in after so many hours. 
---
I'm very confident that a very small percentage of guilds will be doing hardcore buff stacking. All I know is, I don't want anyone telling me how to enjoy the content. And I will not tell others what they can/can't do, either.
---
You want to funnel gear to your tank to an extent. 
---
However, you don't want to give one guy 8/8 immediately because guess what, he's not going to show up as consistently. 
---
You want to go by major upgrades between two or three tanks. Try to focus on set bonuses when you can. Clear upgrade for one person over another? Easy decision. Both tanks are using the same helm, one is 5/8 and the other is 2/8? Give it to the 2/8 person. Do your best to create incentive to to come to raids. Dangle the carrot as much as possible before they notice the string attached to the stick. Avoid giving one tank 7/8 or 8/8 with the OT sitting at 3/8. Most people argue that once you have 7/8 you should give that last piece to complete the set and I agree. Keep the tank at 6/8 until the other tank is about the same.
---
How tall are you?
---
Awesome. Great info! It sounds like something I can adapt to if it's only one spell I should be ranking much.
---
The video is based off of incorrect pserver numbers. You get far less rep for quests in classic. There were people in beta that did exactly what you are talking about and got about 1/7 of the way through revered at 40.
---
Which is playing wow 24/7?

---
Agree to disagree. I think choosing not to heal someone you can easily keep alive because the pull isn't perfect is way more of a snowflake attitude than just spending a little more mana and doing your job.
---
Don't tell me you encourage hunters on having growl turned on? It's a waste of focus and they can easily snap aggro when initiative a mob \~ one growl does a little bit more threat than two sunder armor debuffs.
---
Maybe not "amazing", but with hex of weakness and Berserking, Trolls are pretty damn near amazing priests. Shadowguard can at least proc from Blackout (shadow stun) so its pretty good.
---
People on the discord testing
---
Class specific. In later expansions, I would go healer on my druid for a meditative dungeon experience (or with mitigation tanks, meditation occasionally interrupted by sheer panic). In vanilla, pugs found ways to make you work. There's a reason people suggest resto druids make friends with shadow priests and shamans.
---
Look at these cool people who bothered to be helpful, and here you are just looking for a problem. How hard is it to just be easy going? What’s your problem dude? I’m sorry to Inconvenience you and waste the obviously very valuable time of a super duper important condescending narcissist

I am, played alliance on Lightninghoof from vanilla to cata. Was guildmaster of a small guild called "The Church" for a bit.

The new UD walk animation is the worst, we bounce up and down like a little Disney princess.
---
Old undead walk was flat out menacing.
---
New models + old animations would be tits
---
Paladin is definitely WoW's CoDzilla.
---
I like to test tanks by doing as much damage as possible and actively attempting to make threat a nightmare for them. It makes them stronger tanks.

"With my help he could be the best"

if you think the vanilla community doesnt min-max you are in for a rude awakening

No it wasn't:

---
Their feature lists are almost identical.
---
Let's say you run 2 daggers with 0 hit early on. Avg speed for dagger is 1.4 to 1.6. So in 6 seconds u gonna do 3-4 hits each resulting in 6-8 hits. Make it 8. So out of 8hits 3 gonna be misses(due to weapon skill and dual wield penalty of 27%). Means in 5 hits u need to get 5-6% dodge depending on lvl.
---
There are better arguments I could make here, but I really want to point out is you do seem like the kind of person that feels others are obligated to take on another person's misery.
---
I think the important question here is what class will the baby start playing in 4 years so he/she can farm for you while you are at work?
---
My mains in the past have been 2 male 1 female and right now I'm conflicted. The female Troll doesn't look quite as bad as I remember. If only they had even one good hairstyle, I'd go for that in a heartbeat. But I'm leaning male troll currently.
---

Priest downranks the most out of all healers. You do it for mana efficiency you dont have to bind all ranks on your keyboard.

They are more attractive then you, so they go for each other.

You obviously don’t have kids. Those 35 lb midgets can groin shot you like no other!
---
Herod's is one of those items where "'cause they look cool" really is all you need.
---
Jokes aside, if you're not alright with the idea of casters taking cloth, Vanilla is not for you.
---
Nice, I played Horde on Lightninghoof until Cata too. Then quit the game. I honestly cant remember my first guilds name. But after Wrath I was &lt;Red is Dead&gt; until I quit.
---
Y'all I'm a filthy casual who is super bad at pretty much everything, but hunters seemed pretty fool-proof to me. And yet we wiped because I forgot to turn off my freaking pet and jumped down somewhere. I felt like such an idiot. Everyone was really nice about it. I learned my lesson.
---
Yes, that is why we are here. Are you a Bfa troll or do you have other reasons to play classic?
---
Clearly you never played on Private Servers.
---
I remember righteous orb reserves in vanilla but that was the extent of it. Aside from a guild doing a "pug" MC and keeping the bindings
---
I would suggest retail wow. 
---
Part of the reason classic is appealing, is it doesn't have this. The first time I logged into retail a month ago (it had been about ten years), I could not believe the micro transactions available.
---
I'll be a hunter, so none really.
---
Challenge accepted!
---
Nah it instant cast. It's literally just a shadow version of lightning shield, and it can trigger blackout.
---
Boring they are, my friend.

Now this is some good quality content. Have a upvote my friend!

well we should not have meme races lol. Thus, the game can be improved in a way that does not hinder mechanics such as player to player socaial aspects and all the other reasons why people like vanilla
---
Ah, just looked into it. It was quickheal that did it all for you
---
My bad, I'm dumb
---
I usually get to play around 8 pm - 11 pm on weekdays and longer on weekends. I always spend time with my son while hes awake. The things taking hits is sleep and alone time with the wife:))
---
lol’d pretty hard at this
---
Good thing about Classic is most of us playing are already married and moved on with our life. Probably will cut down on weirdness quite a bit.
---
It's the pvp aspect of fear ward that makes it strong.
---
It was extremely common for righteous orbs.
---
No easy way? Just check if in combat -&gt; unable to sit. Or simply remove sit crits completly.
---
How on earth do you make these? You pump them out so fast!
---
Wait really? Was the pickpocketing money that overtuned on some/all Pservers?
---
But are they certified to not have donkey brains?
---
It's no doubt that the old guard at Blizzard have been and will continue to be slowly subverted by acti-accountants who shortsightedly design around meeting quarterly expectations rather than sustainable goals of quality game design.
---
But if it's any consolation, Starcraft Remaster is in a lot of ways a test case for WC3R and Classic WoW, and they've done a pretty good job of monetizing the game without compromising on it's core values. That is to say some pretty impressive **client side** graphics packs (seriously check out the [Starcrafts](https://imgur.com/8WWqcGR) one), as well as some popular esports announcer packs apparently, all of which is invisible to those who wish to play the game in it's original state.
---
The cynic in me expects that it's only a matter of time before additional monetization is pushed onto Classic WoW, but hopefully it follows the standard of SC:R, rather than that of modern WoW.
---
That’s what most of the hunters I saw ran with, bone slicing hatchet was a great weapon
---
Lol, you haven’t exemplified any of the qualities of someone looking to have a productive conversation. 
---
You’ve done nothing but talk down to me and call me names in an embarrassing attempt to contradict me about everything.
---
Private servers aren’t close at all. We won’t be seeing hour clears of naxx with a fury tank on classic ever.
---
I’m willing to wager you believe that multiple guilds are gonna clear mc in the first lockout too. 
---
You should just stop responding, you have embarrassed yourself.
---
They get a renew and a shield. 
---
That’s it
---
Warlocks. Just feel like shitty clunky Mages. You think lifetap would be   nothing but a positive right? but it feels like all of your spells cost 3x the mana to make up for having it.
---
...ok
---
There was a long thread about this on the classic forums the other day. People losing their minds if you suggested telling someone how to look it up instead of spoon feeding them info.
---
Pink ponytail gnome female warriors
---
+25 agility also won't be out for a while, will it?  so more of an ap difference between the two
---
I like your style. If only Blizzard appreciated RP(-PvP) :(
---
I agree with you, for what it's worth.
---
The healer's job is to get the group through the dungeon. Generally speaking, the tank is his primary concern because he should be the focus of most, or ideally all of the damage whenever possible. That said, perfect groups are rare, and rarer still in PUGs, so you have to be flexible. There are times when you have to let a DPS die to keep the tank up, but if you're making a conscious choice to let them die for any reason other than "if I heal them we'll wipe because the tank is under heavy pressure" then you're not a good healer, you're just enjoying playing god.
---
Warrior, just can't ever get into them
---
Taks are arguably the hardest role to find when creating groups, so yes, you will definitely find groups while leveling. Also, you dont need to spend your points on the prot tree in order to tank in dungeons, just equip a shield and you´re ready to go. About raids though, ive never been there but IMO it shouldnt be difficult to find an offtank spot.
---
Cant do it, the items are bop
---
Some of the engineering items you want are BoP so no.
---
Do^you have^such^a^certicate... ?
---
If they want to sure. We won't force people to and using world buffs won't gain you any favors from the officers. If you want to use them you can knock yourself out but don't expect other people to or start complaining about it, that will get you kicked from the guild.
---
Stop putting your retarded words and ideas into my mouth.
---
No, I'm not encouraging playing hunters. Ever. Thank you.
---
PS it's not a taunt
---
How hard is it to google things?
---
When I was my raiding guilds best geared holy priest I'd spam whatever fucking heal I wanted to, would even meme and throw Smites out there during some fights....but I had 2 pocket Druids at all time for innervate so YMMV.
---
Oh really? Define it for me then.
---
Most two handers are basically useless in PvE anyways, other than BRE
---
I have. 
---
Blizzlike and Instant 60.
---
Clearly whatever rationale you used to come to that conclusion(assumption), is wrong.
---
I really love that their explanation outs themself as a dimwit.
---
Yeah, they're good, but in all seriousness, I'd still personally pass on them for a melee. Not saying I expect others to do that though.
---
I'd go for the bone slicing hatchets since no one else would be interested in those at all.
---
Yeah, that attitude will last until the first night you have to call a raid over after a wipe.
---
Thanks, that’s vanilla spirit! What do you recommend then: start with Gobelin and finish with Gnomish ? Or the opposite?
---
K so out of all the wonky shit vanilla has to offer, you want to get to the bottom of nelf priests. Hey troll mages got the shit end of the stick in terms of pvp racials. You want to get them next?
---
It won't be months it'll be a week or two at most until most people who are just trying classic to see what it's like quit and populations stabilise
---
I can't wait to need all items..
---
exactly this, i don't get people who just seem to want walking through the dungeon and occasionally healing the tank. isn't the healers role to maximize the damage your group can deal to the mobs to get you faster through the dungeon with either healing your dps who got aggro or dealing damage yourself?
---
some healers are just lazy players i think.
---
Crippling poison/Kidney shot as well, to give yourself time
---
This was my server back in the day. Thanks for sharing!
---
Yes. Asmongold did it during the beta.
---
Thanks! So what would you recommend: start with Gobelin and finish with Gnomish ? Or the opposite?
---
Good job on the math. Yeah, I personally know the Dal'Rends set is better, but I still personally feel bad rolling on them over a melee that I know would actually swing them. That said, I don't personally expect others to pass on them.
---
More like, "are you gonna cast frost bolts or fireballs with your arcane spec?"
---
Well in Retail you play like a DD, just spamming any button and you can't lose aggro. A DD deals 150k+ dps on M+? You don't care, you cannot lose aggro.
---
In Classic, if you don't have a good rage management and use the correct priorities aswell as switch targets properly, every dps can pull your mobs. Just have a look at all those vids on Youtube. Nearly every tank is failing on their use of abilities. On top they are very slow at pulling, which was quite harder in some instances, because of pats and the larger aggro range.
---
In classic it is about pulling just one group, not adding anything and having a proper CC. In retail it is just about rushing through the instance as fast as possible and pulling as many groups as possible, to AoE anything down.
---
The difficulty in classic is not to fight against one mob in the first place, but to controle everything so well, that you can fight properly on single target.
---
Well and the rage management is by far more important. As i just wrote, watch some videos and look how people are playing. Most of all tanks in classic fail to provide good TPS.
---
It's kinda simple really. Spamming frostbolt is easy and gets great results in PvE. It doesn't take a lot of effort to contribute in a raid and you can be effective while having the 1 button rotation. 
---
TL;DR: path of least resistance wins
---
I'm pretty sure in classic any mob doesn't leash if you keep attacking it at least once every 10 sec.
---
Yeah but that was 15yrs ago..... It's 2019 there's female streamers and gaming is seen as casual as fuck/mainstream. No one cares there you're a female gamer now.
---
I think I am going to do this too. I think our best option is to set your hearth to stormwind or ironforge. You will only have to do this for your first 20 levels, though, as you get your ironforge/sw teleport spell at level 20. Darnassus is level 30.
---
Are y’all shittin on Thiccens again?
---
Yes, yes, no, yes, yes, no
---
Was lightninghoof rp-pvp? I think that's where I played.
---
1. Community is everything. Because of that your reputation matters. You can’t join a random group, not talk, and need on everything only to leave the group because you’re never going to see them again. 
---
2. You actually interact with people in the world because it’s dangerous. You can and will die several times. You have to group up for certain quests. 
---
3. Gear, levels, class, and talents matter. If you get a new piece you can feel it. No fear of titanforging. If you level up you feel it. Class identity is a thing and it matters. Actually having talents to choose from matter. It makes you commit to playing a certain way or having to pay to change it. 
---
4. You actually make friends. Since you can die you often make friends while leveling and some of those friends invite you to their guild where you can make even more friends. I have some friends from back then that I still talk to today and I don’t play retail anymore. 
---
5. The story. You aren’t THE hero. You’re an adventurer who got tired of the way things were going and decided to pick up a sword and do something about it. You only start out killing kobolds and clearing out the defias gang (Alliance) and one day you hear about a dragon that’s corrupting stormwind. And one day you kill that dragon. 
---
Vanilla WoW is an adventure where you earn everything you have. Where you can sit in IF proud on your epic mount in full T2 knowing not everyone can easily obtain that gear. Classic WoW is a game that develops memories that you never forget. 
---
The same one.
---
So you fear the mob, they run away.
---
You put Curse of Recklessness on them, they are now immune to fear, but still have the fear debuff on them. They will start running towards you.
---
You put another Curse on them, removing CoR, they are no longer immune to fear and will run away.
---
This can go badly if you get a few resists in a row. CoR also increases their attack power, which naturally isn't great if they get a few hits in.
---
Uhg another "you member? I member"
---
afaik 15 agi on one hand weapons was introduced much later than 25 agi on two hand weapons though.
---
Fear is the ass-to-mouth of wow. [Sometimes in the heat of the moment, it's forgivable to go ass to mouth.](https://youtu.be/3buEelLrjZ4?t=184)
---
No more slog leveling a protection warrior than a dps warrior; you will level in the same specc.
---
...
---
Bone slicing will not be in phase one. That was part of the expanded loot list that comes later in the expansion.
---
Dal is BIS preraid.
---
Where?
---
 You should play the class you like the most. If you are unsure about the mechanics of something you are about to tank just look it up beforehand on google to get an idea. 
---
  If you end up rolling a secondhand choice there is a big chance you will regret it later on. Going to suck if you are like 10 days played into it and wishing you had rolled a warrior. Being passionate about the class you are playing is very important.
---
Get them to play to level 10. They’ll never stop.
---
Although Chen's Keg will be making an appearance.

[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20525/earthen-sigil](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20525/earthen-sigil)
---
Other way around. There was initially only 15 agi enchants and then they added 25 agi to make 2hs less trash
---
I think you really want to play orc! Just do it, you don't need to justify your choice haha.
---
This is something I noticed too when I messed around on a Human Rogue - the Kobolds are yellow and won't attack you so you can just go around for a while and get a nice chunk of change for a low level early.  Seemed too easy.  Have always played Horde so no clue if this is what it was like in vanilla.
---
Thank you, it's astounding how many scrubs are in this subreddit. The game *completely* changes when you have a skilled group.
---
That wallpaper is awesome, fantastic battle station.
---
Wow what lazy devs. I'd would have expected them to level 1,000 characters from lvl 1 for us to play for one weekend. Classic is such a dumpster fire.
---
You can look at my post history...
---
Warlock is kinda the same flavour Judy a different name?  At least in my mind.
---
You start off with no cc, chaotic pulls, then you learn a bit, start ccing, los pulling, then you get good, and don't need that stuff anymore. Must be nice to have a dedicated group to roll with, lol.
---
You only need 9% hit for bosses not 14%- that includes all attacks including tranq shot
---
What makes you say that? Curious
---
As i dont purchase ingame virtual goods, and dont feel aesthetics ingames are not worth my money. This Survey dont apply to me at all.   
---
Still i hope you get the results you where looking for.
---
There's a website out there that's more in depth than Kenco's research from 2006, however it's the best I could find at the moment:
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kenco%27s_research_on_threat
---
&gt;e) Demo Shout ftl. Demoralising shout does one sixth the threat of a sunder. Even spammed in defensive stance with defiance, you're doing no more threat than 42dps on each mob. Besides picking up whelps in Onyxia and tanking panthers in the Panther boss encounter in ZG, i can't see a compelling reason to use this.
---
I'll use demo shout if I have excess rage and I'd like to reduce incoming damage, but I never use it for threat generation.
---
Is it that important to play a female nelf priest? God damn these weebs.
---
I recorded rep amounts (including spillover rep) for every single quest as I was leveling my way through the Beta as a Human Rogue (10% rep bonus). Stormwind was the rep that I got closest to exalted by 40 at 6,469/21,000 revered. You can see my results at the link I posted elsewhere in this thread.
---
That’s definitely a wowhead bug.
---
You're missing the absolute most iconic one, Carrot on a Stick.

Alliance Priests: [Consecrated Wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5244/consecrated-wand#comments)
---
This is the fastest wand available, and it is good to switch to for long boss fights during "wanding phases" (when boss damage output is low, a paladin puts up seal of wisdom instead of seal of light or some other debuff, and most healers are encouraged to stop healing in favor of hitting the boss to restore mana.
---
Gotcha. I don't recall that guild name but we may have briefly played at the same time during TBC. I started about half way through playing very casually and reached max level at the beginning of Wrath
---
The O in OLED stands for organic which is why you have burn in. QLED wont suffer from burn in.
---
I'm the type of dork that "self inserts" while playing games. Like RP but just in my head. And yes I can see myself being a troll, or undead in my fantasy world. But can I see myself being a woman? No
---
Also remember that some of those items won't be in the game from the start, so you might be a bitt less "meltface" early on.
---
Very strong. Healing is probably a little worse than a priest who has more cool spells like PoH/Shield for some tricky spots - but BoP/HoJ/DP are insanely good utility spells that are awesome wipe-savers, and you get amazing group buffs like BoW/BoM/Fire and Shadow res auras.  
---
Only time people would actively chose a priest over a pally might be in strat/scholo where shackle UD can come in handy for an undergeared/underlevelled group.  
---
Druid is a distant 3rd for 5man and raid healing in vanilla.
---
I've recently added the ability to open a saved build on wowhead and twinstar. It's in the build info and links under the options menu. However, there is no way yet to share a link that will open in the app, still trying to figure out how to do that.
---
Correct!
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17705/thrash-blade
---
From what I know it is BiS for Combat Rogue till way into MC
---
PvP my friend. No other class has more control. Defensive cool downs are nasty. The ability to CC one player and bursting another is crazy. Skill cap is high but when everything comes together and you beat a healer and dps 2v1 it’s just a great feeling.
---
i prefer this, too many especially female models in game are legit just humans with different facial features.
---
Cool, that’s what I thought from my time playing Pally in Vanilla, but it was just so long ago I wanted to be sure. Thanks!
---
You can find Chen’s keg. That’s close enough
---
I can’t even imagine the humiliation that team must feel. It’s so simple, make good game, people will spend money. 
---
Make game for money =\ people will slowly leave and you’ll be left with whales. 
---
But at the need of the day it’s whatever is going to bring these companies the most money, they don’t even care about player numbers anymore. It’s all who’s spending how much where
---
Have you heard if the crazy thing called a timezone?
---
!!!!
---
shadowmeld is ok if you're waiting for people to walk your way, but it couldn't be used in combat in vanilla. 
---
in pvp, i think there are better alternatives for when you get locked out. such as throw engineering grenade or bubbling or dispelling. getting locked out usually wont last long whereas starshards last 6 sec, unless u stop channeling, but good point still.
---
Internet culture and slang was a lot different back then too. When was the last time you heard someone actually talk about "**pwning noobz**"?  
---
Something as simple as someone typing "**kthxbai**" before leaving a party can tell you a lot about their demographic.
---
PoM Pyro and aoe Frost are both extremely satisfying ways of playing if you like BG grinding. They’re squishy sure but if you’re running in premades or have a good team that looks out for each other, it’s quite fun.
---
bag drops rates are insanely higher on pservers
---
I think since you haven't been able to enjoy the endgame as much because of limited time, your approach to leveling sounds very reasonable. Joining end game in a later stage is nothing to feel bad about, many many people will do the same, as long as you arrive surrounded by the right crowd to keep you involved and having a good time. I'm sure you'll manage just fine with your gameplan. Enjoy the real deal my man, see you out in the world!
---
Counter-Strike and DotA or only a few of the examples we have of sequels that do the original justice but also are the same game. If someone was good at CS 1.6 in 2005 and took a time-traveling spaceship to 2019 they could spend probably 20 hours and be just as good at CSGO today. Same goes for DotA 1 to DotA 2 but the same can't be said for almost any other game franchise.
---
Really there’s not much point in reckoning in bgs either if we’re being real.
---
Maybe he doesn’t want to play with Australians... don’t be rude
---
Not everyone that played classic raided MC during 1.3 and even still why not beg for the broken talent trees and worse classes to have the genuine experience?
---
Kinda funny if they pulled up an item that never existed and gave it to stress testers.

I see. Yes, VM was quite the envy on bonechewer. They were in the top 10 kills on a number of bosses in classic WoW.
---
Got my 4-5 year old laptop a brand new SSD, cleared it of dust and the like. Should be good to roll!
---
I hope...
---
Unless you're a shaman with rockbiter spamming earthshocks and getting windfury crits.
---
Mage is really involved in PvP and leveling. Group PvE ... not so much. But the class fantasy, aesthetic, and game play outside of raids keeps me interested in mage.
---
That was one of the Dragons for the Hordes Onyxia's Layer attun. Not one of the nightmare dragons unfortunately.
---
Thank you
---
I so agree
---
I absolutely hate those ugly things. They shouldn't be part of the Horde.
---
I'm so thrilled they wont exist in classic.
---
next thing we're going to find out is their internal testing of 40+ areas is bug free only with the earthen sigil equip.
---
So wowhead lists a version for live that also isn't in the game and seems to  be updated every expansion. Maybe it is a GM only testing item  but if that is the case why so low on Mana. Hm.
---
Yeah wtf? Fucking casuals are ruining this game, ffs. Can we get them fired.
---
Nope. No Illidian or Kael either. Blizzard didn’t start really using voice acting until the end of TBC and didn’t start using you as the center of the narrative until WotLK. None of the story characters you long for exist in Classic and the ones that do appear are just silent NPCs.
---
Why is that relevant? Yes I did and so?  
---
&gt; but okay mr. dictator sir  
---
Blizzard themselves want it this way. There's no way they will ever change something like this, no matter how much you cry about it. Just saying.
---
At least we didn't have to make do with gnomes.... *shudders*
---
Arya Stark would like a word with you
---
I like to take the caretaker role as healer. When the tank pulls too much or is failing to pull in the right way, i just switch to my armor set in bear form and show him da wey. (i'm always healing in heart/ns spec, never go full resto) Also you can talk down on them as much as you want because getting rid of someone in a group in classic is way harder than it is on retail. As long as you are not being too big of an dick to your retarded tank and dps, it should be fine. At least in my P-server experience.
---
Secret alliance loving fools. Blood Elves were the worst thing to happen to the Horde.
---
Unfortunately not. One of the later patches of the game chained all world bosses to their "arenas" as it were. If you try to kite them too far, they will de-aggro and run back.
---
Unfortunate really, If you happened to play on Dragonblight-US you got the pleasure of Mesa kiting Nightmare dragons into Orgrimmar and Stormwind at every possible opportunity.
---
But I saw a chest! 
---
I had to try to go loot it while everyone was in combat to make sure I actually got it.
---
If I decide to lead a guild again, I plan on running raids in the morning.
---
It really looks like I might be in the minority here but: Warrior. Stance switching feels unintuitive to me and they actually have tons of spells so the rotations for each different pvp scenario seem too complicated to ever master without going alllll in and really loving it and playing nothing else. I’m an alt-aholic so I never got very far with them. Rogue, paladin, mage, and warlock are all I ever really played even within their simplistic tool kits there’s a lot of flexibility with how to play them all, I just can’t imagine ever feeling like I made optimal choices as a warrior.
---
All the good goblin stuff is BoE so you can go gnomish and be fine
---
You serve us, not the other way around. Now start moving your damn fingers
---
Looks good! But the cables below would annoy the shit out of me.
---
I'm with you, mate. I usually tank or dps, depending on what's needed and it has always amazed me how entitled tanks and healers act. I especially noticed it back before LFG in Vanilla, BC, and Wrath. Just do your fucking job.
---
There's no riptide or healing rain in Classic, my shaman brother
---
Do you have a link about cloth turn ins being added in phase 1?
---
Considering you cant get it until level 45 and usually finish the quest around 50, not so surprising.
---
What's the deal with meme specs? I keep seeing mention of it on this sub and don't want to get caught up in the drama.
---
As far as I know, Kazzak is not kiteable either.

Honestly it just flows so weird. The late 20’s kinda suck too, then once you can do SM and quest in STV it picks back up. Then sucks again from like 42-50. Uldaman, ZF and the 40’s dungeons arent as fun. Not to mention Uldaman starts at 42 ad the ending is like 48. That said, the 50’s are super fun. Quests are great in the plaguelands, BRD, ST, Scholo, Strat, BRS, all that shit and you can start making choices that will matter at 60, do you grind rep? Grind BiS from 5 mans? Etc
---
If you grab a lesser mystic wand then you can clear out teldrassil pretty easily. But not really viable on a launch since you won't have the gold or someone to craft.
---
Absolutely. Really sad. Thankfully we have Classic atleast to remember.
---
Just give him the game manual: https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/263A8NGR8HLZ1556919642368.pdf
---
I didn't play the Diablo series, but from what I've read and talked with those who were enthusiasts, it was a serious letdown. I don't see how anyone would expect a D4 to be any better.
---
Orc girls are so spicy though! Gotta love em!
---
Probably include if its Horde or Alliance only.
---
Yeah, it's usually ten times creepier and unwarranted.
---
Downranking is NOT "mandatory" for Paladins in the slightest.
---
Even at low gear levels you can spam max rank Flash nonstop with major mana / demonic runes.
---
Rank 1 flash is only useful when you're super geared (700+ bonus heal) because then it will heal for like 500-600, using a completely negligible amount of mana. And even then, you don't use it all the time, you only use it during periods of low damage to save mana.
---
You never had to go through BRD. Before the teleport NPC you just jumped through that window by him.
---
Oh, people absolutely picked the wrong reward from that quest back in vanilla.
---
If you are going to show off your setup you should at least clean up your cabling. They sell kits to clean it up if you aren't super handy. But it takes away from everything to just see so many random wires in the back and a mess on the floor.
---
Messy, chaotic, and unorganized... yep, definitely Horde.
---
True again
---
The quality of this is just so sick. Makes me wanna cream my britches.
---
Now, I notice you didn't list usable quest items that can be used for fun / peacocking. Plan to incorporate those? If not, I'll eventually make a youtube video about them once I learn how to datamine it.
---
I’m pretty sure for it to be viable you need to be hit capped otherwise you will just miss and make it pointless
---
1 cute one, 2 smiles that are kind of evil but not disgusting, and the rest are nope.
---
Or just say, " Hey, this lvl 60 armor bonus stops working at 75" to give youj incentive to get the good lvl 80 sets in a few levels, or whatever.  They already have the tech for that, it was on legion legendaries, they turn off at 115
---
seems like a scam
---
They did this with the legendaries at the end of the Beta.
---
The amount of time he's had my PC?
---
Right click Edge icon. -&gt; Unpin from taskbar...
---
Cloth gear for spellpower hunter PvP spec.
---
Probably not. DM is Phase 2 and the vast majority of players won't be 60, much less farming for pre-BiS already.
---
Do it for the sacc

Nobody is crying retard lol. I simply asked what you guys think about it. You've already shared your thoughts now shut up already.

[There will be no TCG code redemption in Classic](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/tcg-mounts-and-pets/199459/38) as there was no TCG code redemption in Vanilla. Leandro Longshot was not available until the TBC pre-patch.
---
Added in patch 1.13
---
Rereleasing cards =&gt; price drastically drops =&gt; less hype for tigers and Blizzard.
---
Wrong
---
We say outside the box in the UK too.
---
It’s less the boringness to me, and more that playing a melee class without a slow is awful.
---
I guess I'm the only one that likes Starshards for leveling and baiting an interrupt
---
Priest here, holy from lvl 10 - nax.
---
From memory I had 3 ranks of flash and greater heal in my bars. Usually using the mid rank and saving max ranks for the trinket popping big dick heals!
---
The more your gear improves the more you can downrank in most cases :)
---
That quest also has a pair of boots that increases Stealth level. The mask is objectively better stat wise, but long term use it's a toss up of the other 2.
---
aka, appears to be a beta data pulling anomaly, keep your eyes out sure, but don't go expecting it.
---
You should mention wands for different schools of magic for BWL Chromatic Dragon trash and Chromaggus.
---
**Mages want a shadow and nature wand.** Maybe arcane b/c missiles is meh.
---
**Warlocks want a frost and nature wand.** Maybe fire because searing pain is meh and too much threat on vulnerable targets.
---
Phase 1 will last 2-4 months.
---
I've decided to play on EU servers as a US player. Times work well for me and I get to avoid US politics chat in the barrens!
---
Yeah, but the shit is empty.
---
UD and Orc anything on alliance, Elf and human anything on horde
---
Hey how did you get that flair? That looks so cool.
---
Yeah no, I had to think about it/google it to make sure I wasn’t losing my marbles. We say both phrases here. Don’t ask me which is more common. Probably box. Anyways
---
You said BS is an effective threat generator for aoe threat. At a certain mob count demo is better. 
---
If demo becomes more effective than what you say is an effective generator, then how is demo somehow worse than BS?
---
Either they're both bad or both good. They do the same thing at different mob counts.
---
Dalrend's set is still better than Trash Blade, but it's great to have in the meantime and while lvling.
---
Pretty sure Dartols rod was added in 1.13 so it won't be available on launch. Can anyone double-check this?
---
I feel like people who want to wreck face as Shaman and don’t know what they’re getting into are going to quite before level 25
---
male gnomes have spring green hair.
---
2 weeks and layering is gone? This guy is utterly insane. And I don’t like seeing him and his blatant lies get upvotes.
---
&gt; Warriors will be lucky to get enough rage to press more than one button.
---
That's not true, you get charge and battle shout at 4, that's 3 buttons right at level 4, let alone rend and hamstring. I honestly got more enjoyment out of playing druid pre-10 because I got to cast spells before I meleed.
---
Paladin. Only 1 viable spec and it's dreadfully boring to play.
---
if anyone dies in my group its obviously spell batching.
---
That isn't really true, is it? Wasn't the data from those databases fed automatically by an add-on you would download and use in-game?
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Awesome, thank you
---
That makes sense, thanks!
---
Looks like wallpaper engine on steam. I'm not OP so I cant confirm
---
Except for bags, especially at low lvl. On p.server I have to vendor 6slots because I have like 9+ extras by the time I even make it to thunderbluff to put them in my bank.
---
There's a demand for it I'm sure.
---
whats the progression? Are dungeons worthy of your time? Is horde or alliance better to level? Is it possible to grind mobs effectively kind of like mages to level? are there any videos / guides for levelling a druid? What professions should I pick up and why those would be some of the questions I'd have to ask.
---
I'm not going to argue it with you. Try it.
---
They were there in the beta.
---
I like it too, they should make it better 😉
---
I used to play Rogue with my Rogue friend, it wasn't pretty as a kid.
---
Man, I can't fucking wait for TBC, honestly. No more ambiguity about who gets to roll on what. Sonic Spear until I die.
---
Dont scarms video only take into account a 5% parry rate not 17%? Thats a 250% increase in parry hastes. 
---
Thays if we are talking about dual weilding tanking like i think you mean
---
Oh man, I forgot we are going to go back to complaining about bad tanks and bad healers, and those bad tanks and bad healers are going to say “no that bad dps is the bad one” despite being the only common person everyone complains about, and so on and so forth of everyone complaining and then the tanks circle jerking each other on reddit with the healers, because they are the gift to all of the rest of the players. 
---
I love wow
---
But what's he going to do for the first year or so?
---
Same. You bet your sweet ass I'll gun anything down, from grey to skull.
---
Warriors are very gear dependent, so if your gear is bad you need those prot skills, I'm a big fan of dungeon leveling because I play with my friends so we can run with a premade group.  I dont know how much experience you have playing warrior, but I'd recommend playing prot and as you get more comfortable tanking and your gear improves then you try moving over to fury, keep in mind in dungeons you have 1 healer so if your dps doesnt kill bosses quickly then your healer risks running out of mana causing a wipe, basically prot is safer/slower, and fury is riskier/faster
---
"Why the hell would targets be marked in dungeons though?"
---
It means that with the simplification of retail over the years Blizzard removed them.
---
Dude!  That is flipping amazing!  I’d upvote it twice if I could!
---
Beyond trolls and Tauren, all the male models in WoW look *really* bad. I'm going Alliance, so all ladies for me but that's my norm anyway. I plan to RP them as well.
---
Certain specs are just really bad in classic. This isn't like retail where you can play any dps or tank and have respectable numbers. Specs like boomkins, shadow priests, elemental shamans are example of specs that are very bad
---
Has very little to do with any *supposed* simplification in Retail compared to the fact that every zone was redesigned with all new quests in Cataclysm.
---
This is an amazing list!! I’ve saved it for reference. 
---
I noticed in several spots you mentioned phases. What are you referring to here? Phases of classic wow release or levelling? I’m not familiar tbh
---
MuH fEaR wArD
---
They were replaced in the Cataclysm expansion.
---
The item ID of the item is 20525
---
Item ID's seem to be assigned in the order they were added to the game.
---
Might of Menethil from Kel'Thuzad has an item ID of 22798 which suggests the trinket was added earlier.
---
The previous item is 20521 and the next item is 20526 which are both items added in Patch 1.8. This suggests the Earthen Sigil should have been added in Patch 1.8 as well. Seems like just some item that was made, but they never put in a quest or as a drop from anywhere.
---
prot leveling was buffed alot in wrath. in vanilla and tbc you level as 2hand arms or fury
---
Around the great forge and he was not allowed to run, he had to walk. Sorry "crater" was a bit disrespectful.
---
&gt;Also......why am I being downvoted for providing helpful corrections to the guide? This sub, I swear.
---
because you lack the ability to offer criticism without being an asshole
---
Sliverblade is faster at 1.40 speed, and buyable on the AH
---
Nice! Thanks for putting this together!
---
Warlock: [Orb of Dar'Orahil](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15108) This is the reward from a warlock quest chain startable at 35 and requiring you to kill a lvl 40 elite meaning its more attainable around lvl 40. This item is almost prebis, second only to [Spirit of Aquementas](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11904) or if you want to purchase a shadow damage offhand from the AH which rarely roll over 20 damage meaning any improvement may be very expensive. When you complete [the quest for the orb](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=4964) you are given the option of choosing  [a staff](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15106) which at first glance looks better due to it having more shadow damage. This however is false once the offhand is paired with one of many mainhands.   
---
(Quick note: This is prebis early phases. The staff already on the list is not going to be attainable until around phase 4 or 5 as it is catchup gear.)  
---
The orb can be paired with one of two mainhands to make it better than the staff. [Scorn's Focal Dagger](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23168) or  [Hypnotic Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7714) are both from Scarlet Monastery.   
---
ALSO when you are completing the quest chain for this orb you will get the option of getting the [Staff/Orb of Nar'Orahil](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=4975)  which are fire damage equivalent items. Do not get these please.
---
The problem is that there are so few sexy models. Male BEs and Draenei are nice, but we won't have those. :c
---
Wow, that's really useful. I never realized the benefits of the skull of impending doom at the time.
---
Hunters and Warlocks. Pets are annoying to manage.
---
Mind soothe is really good for DM skipping too
---
I am 6'2" and 173 lbs. Was concerned I was too skinny when I dropped below 169 trying a ketogenic diet.
---
Keeping track of available weapons is getting too hard...

---
There are green BoE crafted boots that give the same +5 stealth level - so very easy to obtain.
---
T0.5 and Naxx Boots give an even better +8.
---
So as far as I see it the cloak is superior.
---
I’m struggling to think why it’s useful though.
---
Just for when you don’t have shards? 
---
When would you need a void that you can’t just farm a shard?
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about those boots. I played night elf rogue so I already had an extra stealth level over others + 5/5 MoD was more than enough for me.
---
Did they bring back gnomish death ray as a claymore?
---
It wouldn't fly. If I went to bed early, I'd get questioned. Same with getting up extra early. Already getting up at 6:30 to have time to get to work.
---
Getting up early to play a game. Heaven forbid I ever did that for something as childish and pointless as computer games. :(
---
Yeah, classic is going to be tricky...

Except on an engineer who can make the parachute cloak.

More potential raid DPS in Classic would make successfully fury tanking *more* of a deal, not less.

I have an even better example - Warlock's Firestone.
---
Literally every mmo.  Casual players who don't min/max join casual guilds who struggle with content that the hardcore guilds have had on farms for months.  I'm not sure what the point of posting this really is, either you don't want the classic experience and are trying to point out its inferiority or you're making an excuse as to why your guild will fail before the server is even launching.
---
Just have fun, bring enough tanks and heals to your raids and let the dps chips fall where they will.
---
Ok... so they will still be in classic?
---
Ahh... so they will still be in classic?
---
Do the math for mental agility yourself, it's trash tier talent, if it would be possible to put 0 in you'd do that.
---
Don't throw away the really sticky glue! It's great for surviving ganks. Make that shit last.
---
Is there no Mage trainer in Darnassus? Or does he have to go all the way to IF/SW?
---
Some good info here but you left out the most important part.. no matter what you level, do not dual wield.
---
I just don't ever remember it being a thing. EVER.
---
That was a p-server thing. Same with 10-manning 5-man dungeons and 15-manning 10-man dungeons. I mean I only ever saw that on the most recent private server. I thought it was scrub shit tbh. All the private servers before that it was just standard 5-man and 10-man for UBRS.
---
Sure but it increases your dps more when youre overgeared which you should be if youre the MT, when everyones full bis end of naxx yeah it becomes more of a problem.  The crit changes also effect everyone relatively the same
---
Here's my guide to playing a healer in vanilla. 
---
Step 1: Press your heal button to heal. 
---
There is no step 2.
---
They came into the game later, so I doubt it.
---
Seems like something that's easily avoidable.
---
yes of course, basically this is a rollback server
---
What is the benefit of this?
---
The Warrior isn't going to do considerably damage and won't be generating rage, so he/she won't be generating significant threat. So the DPS can't do their job.
---
It's just putting the run on pause until the shield breaks.
---
its not
---
Should be, definitely.  The other guy is right of course, Cataclysm removed a bunch because it reorganized the landmasses but others, like druid form quests, were just straight up removed because of whiny beta try-hards.
---
Fear ward lasts 10 minutes on a 30s cd. 
---
Trinket is a 5 min CD and is your only way out of a rogue stun or a warlock seduce -&gt; soulfire.
---
I think a casual guild that is content with their casual status isn't going to be very hung up on raid composition. Like someone else said, as long as they have enough tanks and healers to get something done they will just do it much slower. I think the bigger issue is losing reliable once casual raiders to more hardcore guilds when progress is slow due to their lack of optimization.
---
yeah im blanking out also, no clue
---
Any weapon proc with frost damage works on Viscidus, like  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=5756](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5756), [https://classicdb.ch/?item=14487](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14487).  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=11931](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11931)  is usually considered BIS until arcanite reaper or raid drops.
---
I know. During the latest Pserver launch I just spent an hour in a Rogue and I had enough gold for a nice fresh start on a low level.
---
Does anyone know if Horde Hunters will still be able to tame a wolf, go to Northshire, Eye of the Beast into it, and then slowly walk around until some low level accidentally attacks it and flags up for PvP?
---
my guild legitimately wiped on the first pull our first time in MC lol
---
Vanilla bosses look more epic  many Post TBC bosses, even when its just a rando dragon.
---
Makes sense, having a constant demand, if the supply is high enough for that single stop MTs are gonna have a hard time finding a definitive spot. Maybe it will be better for raids that require more than one MT (if any exist).
---
Hell I have friends that will still just have a classic WoW subscription as that's when they stopped playing and are coming back.
---
Gotta go to IF/SW.
---
Have you confirmed this. All i have seen so far is a random claim that as armor is less on most boss therefore 0 armor. I have not seen anyone actually work out how the various armor debuffs stack on classic.
---
Classic is all about meeting new friends!  
---
True! I don't know if it will be as back then were the best players in a given realm were actually recognized in that realm and "celebrities" of some sort, we'll see.
---
Mine too!

I mean, after saving the world countless times, yeah, I'd expect to be made a commander, be given a garrison, and have the very best equipment entrusted into my care.
---
Casual guilds won't need multiple Warriors because a casual guild will never get to Naxx in the first place.
---
You're making a lot of assumptions and have literally nothing to back them up.
---
CS:GO does not do the original justice, i'll take accurate shooting over memorizing spray patterns thank you.
---
Isn't shielding before the pull bad? You won't get any rage from being hit.
---
Yeah, you can certainly find some extremely incompetent healers/tanks that should probably find a new role to fill. That's the reason I've never leveled a healer class to max. It's not fun for me, therefore I won't likely put much effort into healing well.
---
You'll be on a RP server and always stay in character.  Then no one can complain.
---
yeah nobody would blame you for looting, idk who doesn't honestly. Minus bag space, but even then I'd still check.
---
Priests do good damage with minimal gear. 
---
10% hit from talents, and lack of any real crit scaling means you start strong and taper off quickly.
---
However - Spriests mana consumption is a real issue. In 60 Blues it may take most / all of your mana to kill a single player, against a healer you might just not have gas in the tank for it - which leads to lots and lots of drinking. If you have a Magebot its just annoying, if not its going to be annoying and expensive.
---
For me the mana issues is whats pushing me away from casual Spriest - if I only have 30 mins to play, I don't want to spend 15 minutes of that drinking, and the other 15 minutes grinding mobs to afford my drink in the first place.
---
My dad mained a Shadow Priest in Classic up until recently.

I know what you mean. It is incredibly rewarding to get a bad pull happen, getting close to a wipe only to pull the rest of the group kicking and screaming through the fuck up. Ending with everyone alive, low health and it of mana. 
---
But having one dps that is constantly attacking the wrong target or pulling, that just gets annoying. Let the tank do his job.
---
It's super strong once your raid can pull off fast Shazz and Vael kills.  People would kill for a 150 AP trinket that lasted a full minute.
---
I also like it on Hakkar when OT'ing to help keep up with the MT.
---
It should be in any Warrior DPS or OT list of trinkets imo.
---
I really cannot agree with the recommendation to not take the Argent Avenger (aka light-sabre) when you're recommending the Warlock staff for looks. It is the only blue light-sabre model in the game (and Teebu's is the only red light-sabre model).
---
Yeah when the heals gets aggro, mages have fantastic tools to deal with it, even passively if they had that target hit by almost all of their abilities.
---
Who keeps the metric system down? 
---
Who controls the British crown?
---
WE DO! WE DO!
---
Sorry I could not resist.
---
Have you looked into shaman yet?
---
^
---
no it doesn't. That was added in Wrath.
---
I play an undead, I can’t smell cause I have no nose
---
You have those backwards. :-P
---
There isn't a metric for weapon damage on default profiles. Maybe that is something that needs to be added. I just updated my profile adding it to the tanking profile, thanks.
---
Those early repair bills will make them learn real quick.
---
If you roll female, you can pretend to be a girl for free gold.  Roll male, and you don't have that option.

Human male models are pretty terrible looking.
---
Bags function very differently in Classic than they did in vanilla WoW.  Some things you can do but could never do in vanilla:   
---
- Hot swap bags even when the bag is full.  In other words, switch out a new bag like in current WoW.     
---
- Click on an item in a bag and have it compare stats with what you have equipped.     
---
Also, bags auto equip when you get one.
---
Coldrage is much easier/faster to get, especially considering that every rogue/warrior in your raid is going to be using 2 of them.
---
&gt;I could switch out fortnite to disney animation but I think people would be defensive if I told them the style they like are directed to kids.
---
Classic WoW itself was accused of this, it was to "cartoony and childish"
---
It's going to take some time for players to adapt to the true meta of Classic Wow.
---
The exact same thing happened to most players 1st entering 1.12 pservers. I went through the exact same thing but I was consciously trying to adjust as fast as possible through research into the game. 
---
Retail Wow changed how people saw Wow just as it changed Wow itself from it's launch. The most simple statement is that you pick a class ... not a spec. People will learn this eventually but likely not until well after becoming frustrated from their initial visions being shattered.
---
If you enter Classic with an open mind to learn the real meta of the game, you will enjoy it much more.
---
Which window are you talking about?
---
Just don't use if 😁?
---
Shaman:
---
Enamored Water Spirit
---
Gives you a totem that restores mana, is way more powerful than mana spring totem. Almost like a much weaker mana tide totem in function.
---
Mage:
---
Celestial Orb
---
Restores some mana when used. A nice additional mana cooldown. The alternative is a staff that's inferior to the orb+hypnotic blade, so not many people should be tempted to pick it, but there's still a chance.
---
You are a sad, sad little man. You also might want to reconsider your sexuality if you think you're straight. Going through a lot of effort just to flirt with men.
---
especially if you're in a group with a mage, I personally don't mind giving people food/water if they actually will use it correctly.
---
Night Elves already have flips and Shadow Meld, what else do you really need?
---
What gave it away, the part where they said they wanted to be a night elf priest?
---
I think it is new user flair. Recently added.
---
Female for casters wearing a dress.
---
Mages are all-around probably the best class in the game. Objectively.
---
Ability to AoE grind, in groups or solo. Can DESTROY single targets. The crowd-control and utility is miles ahead of any other class.
---
One of the best DPSs in raids. For a while they are basically frost-bolts machines, but having the polymorph responsibility can make things a little more interesting. Once you get past BWL and you go to fire spec for raiding they get even better in raids.
---
Only drawback is in PVP they can get fucked pretty hard by hunters, warlocks, and shadow-priests 1v1. In a good PVP group they can absolutely face-melt shit if they have some protection.
---
Teleporting and portals and ability to make food an water can save/make you good money, and the ability to farm DM solo. 
---
Your personal preference is absolutely fine, just offering some reasons of why they are really good and why they're so popular.
---
For me it's driven by what models I can stand looking at. I.e. I prefer female Orcs WAY more than male. Male Orcs look like a square block to me.
---
This changes between race and some I could go either way. I never take human though.
---
I never said I do this. I just buy gold.
---
It also reduces the mana cost of the summon to 0. Usually summoning a vw takes around 1/3 of your mana pool
---
Thank you for all insights! Tanking indeed seems like quite the unique role.   
---
I've never actually seriously played WoW, and tanking seems like the hardest role of them all, but that also makes it the most fun in my opinion.
---
hes saying you face them towards the next pull, not away
---
Still have the char and account :)  
---
Still use the Black Qiraji Battletank as my ground mount to this day :)
---
Prot deals next to no dmg. He produces a lot of threat because the mechanic was way different back in vanilla. Lvling with prot will take ages.
---
I was thinking Druid it Mage originally.  But I just learned from your post that Shadow Priests melt faces.  I’ll definitely be Shadow Priest come launch!
---
yeah sometimes the SM/ruin lock in the tank group can get a corruption slot, other than that plan on just spamming SB
---
You jump thru the window...

My first character was a NE Rogue I got to 60 on Lightning’s Blade.  I got the itch to try the horde side and rolled a Tauren Druid on Lightninghoof after that which ended up being my main through Cata where I pretty much quit playing.
---
Hunters are getting kind of knocked down with how bad they performed in the beta.

There will still be a fucking swarm of them though lol
