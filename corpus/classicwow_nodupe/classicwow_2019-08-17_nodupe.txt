A pro tip: everyone says you can't fear in dungeons, but curse of recklessness can stop the feared target from running, so curse of shadow them, fear them, then if they are running the wrong way, recklessness them so they run back, then put shadow back on until they don't need to be feared again. It's tough to get right, but if you can, you can account for two crowd controls in the group.

Dude, just read through the sub and you’ll have answers. But since I’m nice I’ll give you the answers.

---
Thex is a dude on this sub that posted a thread regarding his plans for naming his character Thex and calling on others to talk about their naming plans. Obviously a silly thing to do if you actually want your name since others will steal it. Basically all the responses to his thread were people saying they would name their character Thex and it became a meme.

Layering is a way for Blizzard to handle huge player populations in small areas of the in game world. Look it up to get more details. 
---
Retail is the phrase given to the current expansion of World of Warcraft, to differentiate it from classic or private servers. 
---
Streamers being on your server will attract a heavy population of immature players who only care about finding a way to play with their favorite WoW personality. Again, there are many descriptions throughout the sub about this. 
---
Private servers are bootleg replicas of Vanilla WoW that players have opted to since even the days of Vanilla WoW. There are many different types and you can do anything you could in retail WoW and even more, and often times you don’t have to pay money for anything. But it isn’t technically legal for the creators to recreate the game without Blizzard consent.
---
queues of 10k JUST FROM PEOPLE RESERVING NAMES
---
Dude it's not a Blizzard problem when it directly impacts the players. Too many servers == ghost towns later with things calm down. They *want* things congested at launch, but opening too many servers to fix this is bad in the long run for *players*.
---
[removed]
---
Seriously? That's wildly dissapointing. From what I heard they added in the classic bow sounds so why not guns?
---
What? Literally all of the EST servers are located in Chicago
---
Pretty cool when you finally finish though. In a roleplaying sense, it should take some effort to employ enough people to attack a sunken corrupted dragon temple. If its just like whatever then you're not gonna care in the end.
---
Bob
---
If Blizzard wanted this problem fixed they should have done it when they released servers by releasing more servers. Dear Blizzard, you reap what you sow.
---
Yea I can’t speak for classic. Fair point! We used it heavily in ssc, hyjal, naxx25 and ulduar25 before our guild lost steam. We had a nice run tho haha
---
Marnkrik Master race.
---
I know!  I'm like, add me please!
---
Oh no, they had to add a server! Totally destroyed classic now. What a shame.
---
No.
---
Ohhh so because your Lord and savior said it's ok, now it's ok for you? Lol...try forming your own opinions and reasoning.
---
What does "give a chance" mean? We're getting layering like it or not. It will be removed sometime before Phase 2 like it or not. Not much else to discuss at this point.
---
just to add on another + since there's only two listed, rogues have way easier threat management than some other classes
---
Cause they WON'T be. Both sides agree a tourist drop will happen. It's how they deal with it is where the community differs
---
Where are the good names in that photo?
---
But isn't there gonna be a big surge of new players when the game actually launches? Would that not push Medium servers to High or Full?
---
It was 20 years after the second war ended that the third war began. Enough time for Thrall and Arthas and Varian to grow up and such. However, seeing the illiteracy of the in-game poster, I'm sure it's part of the in-character. Besides, there will be more than enough in-character scholars attending the gathering that it will be straightened out just fine
---
Speaking for my self, I’m not looking forward finding out about a taurnmill battle only to be on the wrong layer when I arrive.
---
What’s wow
---
Blizzard sounds like a bunch of nerds 
---
Here’s a silver
---
I think you have to factor in that people were most likely looking up what features and changes BfA was bringing vs Classic - which aside from the release date, most people already know what they are getting.
---
And it doesn't necessarily "prevent" login queues in Phase 1, but they should be minimal if anything. I'd be more worried about servers crashing :P
---
You really think blizzard isn't "dropping some gold in his bags"?
---
Negative, kill and chest spawn
---
Get close, cast Scare Beast. Scatter + trap if you need to reset for any reason.
---
As a Feral Druid, my goal was always to kite the Hunter. Seems kind of backwards, but Scare Beast (10 yard range) and Scatter + trap (21 yard range) is that strong. If the Hunter chased me, then I would sit in bear form to mitigate damage and kill his pet while playing LoS games with him. If I can kill his pet, then I'm basically guaranteed to win. Just have to maintain distance, wear him down with Moonfire + Insect Swarm, and stay out of range of Scatter + trap (or else he uses that opportunity to summon a new pet).
---
Rogue is together with Warrior the slowest leveling class in the game.
---
You might be forgetting that it uses the modern client, not the one from 2005
---
Have you ever heard of the term "Don't count your chickens before the hatch" ? 
---
Blizzard has.
---
Yeah I think I'll have the last laugh lol
---
layering is a temporary and necessary evil.
---
let's not start praising layering now. let's just get through it and get to glorious no layering.
---
More than you know lol
---
Yes, and now they are giving you ample warning before launch that if you chose Herod and don't wanna switch you're going to be in queue quiet a lot come the first few weeks,
---
Paladin specific gear should not drop from raids on horde side. Offset pieces such as those in Naxx also shouldn’t drop for them.  It only began dropping in the short duration when patch 2.0 dropped before TBC was released, getting ready for blood elf paladins
---
Deep.
---
This guy would say anything for $$$
---
It won't matter, he'll still be there for the next group of adventurers to fight.
---
Yeah that gave me chills.. So awesome
---
It’s bad for streamers better got normals when it’s gone
---
an internet browser
---
I suspect I will play retail way less when Classic is out so it won't be a huge issue for me even, just minor annoyance. It's just silly I get icons/quick launch for games I have zero interest in owning and not for the game I am most excited for. 
---
As for retail I am mostly just building up b.net balance via gold to pay for sub or any other games that come out, but that means logging in on a regular basis to list auctions.
---
My Guild is 60+ members all with preferred names. Not a chance of moving now. Poor planning on Blizzards part despite every indication this wouldn't be enough servers.
---
Well there are two big dropoffs.
---
1. You have the players who get frustrated with the leveling system and don't even reach level 20(70% of players historically, likely higher for BFA tourists). This is what layering is for.
---
2. You have players who get bored at 60 and come back when each phase it launched. Layering isn't intended for them.
---
Layering doesn't work in vanilla past phase 1, worldbosses /thread.
---
Not sure what the macro is but you can report your character as stuck and it will use your hearthstone. But if your hearthstone is in cool down it'll still do it
---
I didnt sub just to grab my name.
---
And a doubt "most" people did either
---
Playing with my younger brother, really excited to use classic as a bonding experience. We’ve been talking about our classes for weeks!
---
Here's the beef!
---
I liked it, too. Khadgar was good... I'd have watched ten of them if they made 'em. My husband and I had a nice time seeing it in theaters together. I'd kinda like to rewatch it, tbh... Maybe I will before launch. :D
---
I hope this isn’t an attempt by blizzard to float the idea of permanent layering to the masses through a streamer.
---
&gt; My personal preference is queues over layers
---
That wouldn't work, because you'd need many more servers to give people a chance to play even with queues, which then turn into empty servers a couple a months later. Making numbers up, look at this way:
---
With layering:
---
At launch - Server cap 12,000 - 3 layers with 4000 each. Population 12,000 and queuing. 
---
End of phase one after population drop off - laying turned off - server cap 4000 players - population 4000. Healthy. Effectively a full vanilla server.
---
Without layering
---
At launch - Server capacity 4000. Population 4000 and queueing
---
End of phase one after population drop off. Population 1000. Not so healthy.
---
Layering is far from ideal, but is a good way to deal with the launch rush while still having healthy population servers later.
---
Yes.  Because it's like they, and apparently you, cannot do some basic surveying of the various communities surrounding Classic and ascertain that the number of servers was too damn low.
---
I rolled troll back in the day and I hated how they never wore shoes. I'd go orc for that reason
---
Its a circle with spokes, the only people who don't like UC are people who refuse to remember where the relevant/important NPC's are.
---
Can o upvote 10k?
---
Makes sense
---
The real question is: "Is my PC too good for classic? I want that vanilla feeling!"
---
Net engineers should be safe :)
---
Nah, just open new servers earlier than overpopulated realms
---
thats a great idea! I never personally played rogue, so I was scratchin my head on some notes to add
---
I think he means “give it a chance before you make a decision”. Many people on this sub weren’t part of the beta and have already made a decision regarding it without experiencing it.  It’s like someone that says they hate broccoli and it’s worst thing in the world, but have never actually tried it.
---
Blizz should offer free memberships for the first few months while everything gets figured out. 
---
I'm not sure what to do about the people already getting ganked for 15$ a month but I have a feeling the first few weeks (or month) after launch are going to be rough.
---
Be a Warlock. Unleash your inner Slytherin.
---
I think layering is okay at the start because it will be literally IMPOSSIBLE to play without it. But long term? No way. It would be no fun to miss out of big world events because you're put in the wrong layer. 
---
I mean.. at the very start it has a clear benefit that imo slightly outweighs the cons but not after the insane rush is over, no way.
---
Great ! Thanks for creating content.
---
What are the best classes/specs for duo levelling given the following factors?
---
Faction: Alliance
---
Server: Full and PvP (so not sure if gathering multiple mobs and AoEing is a viable duo strategy)
---
Experience: Good at PvP but w don't know much about minmaxing, questing, or grinding (never played vanilla and haven't played WoW since Cataclysm)
---
I do prefer mages and priests so am especially interested in any combos involving these classes.
---
Its not even comparable.
---
Bfa is a new game it also has an advertising budget.
---
not to mention its much easier to keep an existing subscription than it is to aquire a new one.
---
Seemed fine on the stress test. Couldn’t test the trap / feign death stuff but there didn’t seem to be issues with the pet behavior
---
im not sure if the onion used to be funnier than it is now, or if the author was trying to make classic sound genuinely depressing
---
I wasnt particularly sure on rogue leveling for sure, we can totally add a star for combat as that makes sense
---
Damnit, just when I think I figured out which race, you pull me back to Taruen.
---
Unavailable is actually a solid name
---
Haha
---
Right got that. Making it into a macro is the important part.
---
I think you are underestimating "high pop". 
---
Imagine trying to go into BRD with hundreds of other people doing the same. Its a PVP server, so you just chain die in heavy lag.
---
HAHA YEA RETAIL BAD ACTIVISON BAD HAHAH VANILLA GOOD HAHA.
---
With a friend lol.
---
Classic wow isn't free. If you want to play classic wow you must pay $15/mo.
---
People who say/believe classic wow is free are the same people who said the classic demo at blizzcon was "free".
---
This guy is a fraud now, has been for about a year. Tuned in last night to see him struggling in Uldaman.
---
Yup. I logged in. Then logged out.
---
Yeah but phase 1 will last way longer than people think. Don’t be surprised if we’re 4 months into Classic and still getting layered.
---
How much too. It’s also neglecting the fact that in vanilla when pop was steadily rising there were “dead” realms. So launching with 50+ realms guarantees dead realms just like in vanilla.
---
Check out Questlime. Very similar to VanillaGuide, but has a smoother look to it IMO.
---
DO NOT DIE NOW. Or you wont even be in peace in heaven.
---
Did they remove emerald dream? It was in there originally.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
GM Island was removed from the files the same time they removed it from live (8.2) so i was told its probably some automated removal from all non-internal versions.
---
My guess is just general negativity. Although sometimes when I get really bored I do things like this that many people think is silly. No problem though, I know this shit is weird.
---
My dad and I first started playing around when the TBC pre-patch came out and he had a buddy from his work who leveled a warrior with us and he kept talking about how awesome it was and how he could kill two mobs at the same time. (Probably refering to sweeping strikes) I think Pservers are tuned incorrectly making it harder than it actually was. I did have a difficult time on the stress test but I've just been playing too much post-cata wow. Once I get used to the feel of vanilla again and learn my warriors limitations I think it will be a lot easier.
---
First, it's not 90%. Almost certainly less than 50%
---
Second, what's to say that's not already factored in and they have margins for that on the servers?
---
Both are true.
---
That sitting stance though
---
&gt;Vanilla raids were extremely simple (by comparison to retail). If I can pug heroic azshara, then I'm sure I can pug about anything in classic.
---
I think you're underestimating where the difficulty will come from, because it won't be the encounter design. 
---
Heroic due to the way lockouts work means you can try with as many groups as necessary and can pick and choose which bosses you want to do, you can also clear a few bosses with one group, stop, then clear more bosses with another. None of which is true of Classic raid lockouts. 
---
You also have cross realm + group finder. 
---
And you have a large mass of players who both are geared through other sources but not are simultaneously unwilling to commit to raiding, something that doesn't really exist in classic.  
---
So while they're going to be simpler fights mechanically, logistically you have pretty much everything working against you. The 20 man raids help a little, and will no doubt be pugged but what the 40 man pug world looks like beyond MC I am not sure.
---
Fuck yes. Imagine Shazzrah/Herod when layering is removed in phase 2. It'll be a fucking warzone.
---
Lok'tar Ogar, motherfuckers.
---
Ah, that's interesting, I thought they were on the coast like the PST servers. Interesting.
---
So you don't believe Blizzard is capable of detecting which account is relogging every 60sec for 8 hours?
---
I left them. I don't care
---
I'm not 15 years younger still. I don't have hours to wait just to get in
---
They like it. I don't know what their lives are still like but they can miss me with that lol
---
What about dagger rogue? I feel harassed
---
Based on rough googling, there are something like 157,000 English words between 6 and 12 characters in length.
---
When you start making up words past that, even accounting for keeping them pronounceable, you quickly get into the millions.
---
The only limit on picking a character name is one's imagination. I tend to find a foreign word that represents a 'trait' that I like for my character, then tweak the letters to make it more "name like."
---
Nice bait
---
Kids here are Ass
---
This but unironically
---
Odd. Maybe my memory is diluted for private servers where this doesn’t happen then.
---
Probably because it's been very popular on private pvp servers for a very long time.
---
It's not tho
---
I had no idea there were 27 months in a year.
---
Eventually, you just stop giving a frak about stuff like that  :)
---
How's the PvP on RP realms? Geniuinely curious
---
Sounds good! Hopefully you can also put in fewer hours (unless you enjoy it too much) to focus on.. hobbies.
---
Troll tolerance is not very high.
---
Yep! I’m on vacation starting today, so no point in subbing early. My names are virtually guaranteed to not be taken, and I have ~20 I’d be happy with anyway. My brother, guildmates, and I are all subbing the 25-26th.
---
Yea, man I want back to Minecraft after trying the stress test. The game is just dead, towns empty, zones empty, it sucks.
---
Mostly knowledge. And yes, but to a much lesser degree. MC is by far the easiest raid. It's the oldest, and that shows.
---
Can't tell if this is sarcasm or not.
---
RAM is so cheap these days
---
No? People are panicking because blizzard made too few servers and its going to be hard to log into them.
---
If you're going to troll about layering, try not to have your most recent comment specifically talk about layering.
---
4 pvp servers maxed but probably not optimal is around 115k total players NA(not sure if they added that new server). Blizzard might actually be retarded.  However like I said day 1 will be the worst because it's a set time on when you can play. After that not everyone will be jumping on all at the same exact time. I predict more people will stay with the game than they expect and we will have layering for a long time.
---
0/10 low effort troll
---
Apparently it's called "Sharding" that causes the system to not show people. But it sucks I unsubbed also after seeing it.
---
I believe it was figureprints.com. You can access your character armoury and also all level of tier sets you might want it dressed in, can also pick a pose and weapons.
---
Reminds me of rs3 vs osrs
---
Yeah then you’ll be fine
---
That's exactly what to expect on a pvp server its not bad lol.
---
Except Rogue has one of the highest skill ceilings for PvP and it STILL polls super low. 
---
But aight. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Makes me wonder how many of those Undead that used to gank me nonstop were senior citizens
---
you can cast it normally too. The stun aint worth the passive stun resist in my opinion
---
So if theres 15k players with layering and they remove layering the cap drops down to 3k? So 12k daily players cant get in anymore until other people log out?
---
Imagine being that much of a loser to create a new Reddit for this

Kinda weird that this dude has no karma and one of his only 2 comments is in a post that is exactly the same as the one he posted.

You didn't have a "spot" on the server, you can still make a character, you just might not get the name you want and you can stay in line with everyone else.

We have no idea how many nazis exist in american but common sense dictates that they are an outlier.
---
There’s a big difference between being respected and objectified though
---
As an EU player names all our servers have trash names so it doesn't matter :)
---
and by that point you were literally broke.
---
THAT'S FUCKING COOL AS WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWHAT
---
Seems like it. I hope Blizzard has some exceptions like bindings because some guilds never get TF due to bad RNG, and keeping them off drop table for a whole phase is rough.
---
Me and my friends are going to be rolling on Pagle. I’m really hoping it won’t be a “dead server” because Classic is not the game I want to invest hundreds of hours and then have to swap servers and start fresh.
---
Only stupid people would stay on such an overpopulated realm and expect a smooth launch, considering what this post said.. you will probably sit in a queue for hours on launch. Meanwhile, people playing on low/medium/high pop will casually start grinding as soon as classic launches.
---
I'm already preparing to watch this subreddit get bombarded with: "Omg the queue is insane! I was promised classic at this exact moment now deliver because I paid for this game!!1"
---
No I just mean that you're unlikely to have those moment in the first few weeks no matter if there are layers or not due to the sheer amount of players. With layers, you'll be in different instances. Without layers, people will rotate in and out of queues. And remember, each layer is still on the same server. The people in your layer are the same people that you'd see without layers. The difference is that without layers each server would be equal to one layer. So what's the difference between 3k players on your layer from your server and the other people who want to play on your server on other layers, and 3k people on a server without layers where the other people who want to play on your server are offline in queues? Would you somehow interact more with those who are waiting in line than if they're in different instances?
---
Yes, in an ideal world, there would be an active base of ~3k concurrent players per server and you'd have no layering or queues. But you have to realize that even without layering, you're still facing tens of thousands of people on the same server. As such, you're unlikely to run into random players both with and without layering. 
---
And you make an excellent point for me about the server queues. Like you said, *layered* servers will have 10k+ queues. And you want servers without layers. How long queues do you think they'd have? 30k? 50k? Did you ever play on a full retail server before Blizzard started sharding? My record was 12+ hours queues early in the launch of an expansion.
---
Just you wait until Blizzard announced their first Spanish PVP server:
---
* Unclaimed Poolside Sunbed

I think classicwow will be like how 2007scape is vs the regular Runescape subreddit... which is to say better memes &amp; becoming more popular than the original

I had a couple of those OH THAT'S RIGHT moments remembering stuff about vanilla warlock, I got to level 6 on test then quit because I don't wanna ruin the experience :D
---
Rip... Played wow since late classic. Never seen an epic drop other than from raids....
---
Of course they will. The fresh servers are going to be full at launch and serious guilds aren't going to want half their roster sitting in a 10k+ queue.
---
#BLIZZARD WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
---
Basically, yes. But it will only be for Phase 1. It's main purpose is to avoid having to open 100 realms at launch, half of which would end up being dead realms. Picture 10,000 people on one server all in the starting zones at the same time. Layering will make it so there are 10 layers of 1000 people (numbers pulled out of my ass). That way you can actually complete a quest.
---
Disappointment is understandable, but if all goes well you really shouldn't notice a huge difference besides the first few zones/days and maybe capital cities at first. Once Phase 2 hits, this switch is turned off. Then, however many people over the "limit" your server is, all those people now get put in a queue instead of on different "layers".
---
Its going to blow their mind when they find out most people didn't actually care and the servers get even bigger on launch day.
---
I rolled horde originally in vanilla, but didn’t play much. Got back into wow at the launch of TBC and rolled alliance with some friends and begrudgingly played as alliance til around firelands in Cata when I made the jump to horde to join a guild. Everything felt so right after that, I haven’t thought about alliance since then and either transferred my alts to horde or just rerolled them as horde. I own a few items that have horde logos on them, it’s how I identify when I speak about wow. But when I loaded up classic to make my characters... and I didn’t have my blood elves or goblins... I was thinking boy those night elves are looking real nice... but it felt wrong and I rolled a troll mage and an undead priest, can’t betray the horde, especially on classic with a worthy warchief.

Well... I wasnt exactly speedrunning. Just casually taking a stroll while getting murdered by 6-legged crocodiles.
---
If you read the thread they specifically stated... 
---
Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.
---
So yeah - you are going to be fine.
---
&gt;  
---
Bro, Chuck Norris is the reason why Waldo is hiding.
---
Well, since I'm the one going off on rants when you have single paragraphs larger than any two of my previous posts in this thread combined... sure, let's turn that around.
---
First: I'm fully aware that you said "for the resources required."  I was talking profitability, which includes resources required (and even taxes, incidentally).  The link you provided gives plenty of credence to my claim on it's own, so I'll use that.  3.4 million copies sold as of the 1st day of launch.  That's 214.2 million in sales (not counting digital deluxe and collector's editions, just multiplying the number by the base price of the game at $63 according to their site right now)
---
To match that number Classic will need to maintain over 1 million subscriptions for a full year.  That's just base game cost of day 1 sales.  That's not including sales after day 1, or digital deluxe, or collector's editions, or subscriptions.  And it's not including the store.
---
Even if Classic has a total resources required equal to $0, the chances of it being more profitable than BfA are incredibly small.
---
You are however correct that I misspoke when I said that Blizzard had claimed that BfA was their most profitable expansion yet.  They have not come out and said such.  It is however fairly easy to extrapolate that from what they HAVE said.
---

---
https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2018-financial
---
These all show year over year increases in revenue, including that WoW brought in more revenue in Q4 2018 than even Candy Crush.  So while I misspoke, it's pretty clear that the numbers back my assumptions rather well.  Admittedly, the numbers I can find aren't nearly as clear for 2019, so perhaps things have changed enough that I'm completely wrong and BfA is somehow not making bank.  But that would require BfA to crash rather worse than WoD did, and I've seen no evidence that it's gotten that bad yet.
---
As for the rest... your own link and quotes actually back me up.  Activision and Vivendi merged in 2008 with Activision's CEO becoming CEO of the new Activision-Blizzard while Vivendi had 52% of shares. But that's not the end of the story.  Per your own quote:
---
"On July 25, 2013, Activision-Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[33] At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[34] and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public."

So, Vivendi sold their control of the merged company, leaving the other party of the merge (the original group called Activision) ultimately in charge.  With the old Activision CEO as the new company's CEO since the merger.  Activision-Blizzard is absolutely the new company name for Activision, as supported by your own evidence.  Oh, and to further my point, they bought the shares which granted them control, thus, the end result is... they bought Blizzard too as part of that.
---
But I'm getting ahead of myself.  You attributed a whole list of conspiracy thinking to me that I never even implied.  I said Activision instead of Activion-Blizzard once in a post, and that triggered you into a chain of rant filled posts trying to prove your superiority and shout me down.  Hell, I never even said anything negative about the company.  I just implied that they like making money.
---
But you know, keep telling me what I think and how I feel based on a few throw away comments that took less than a minute to type out.  And have a nice day, you clearly need one.
---
I've heard this s lot.  I played shaman in vanilla and never touched warrior. Do you just keep a good spare shield and sword for taking as seems? Or do you need a full tank set (max Stam). Or can you 2h tank it all?
---
OH SO NOW PEOPLE ARE MAD ABOUT THE VANILLA LAUNCH EXPERIENCE
---
LOLOLOOL
---
bunch of hypocrites
---
Some think it is too soon for Executus server.
---
Kill on sight, then continue on.
---
Goosebumps! So good!
---
Honestly spells are cheap in the beginning. Buy everything at first, then pay attention to which spells you're actually using. Only buy higher ranks of the ones you actually use. A spell that is a handful of silver is irrelevant at level 40, as you can make that back by going and killing a couple things for 5 minutes.
---
I hope the mods can clean it up a bit, used to be able to come here to talk about classic / vanilla and now it's just being ruined with the cakes, tattoos, amateur art, and normie spam posts like r/wow.
---
If it's not directly related to classic then it shouldn't be allowed, I mean that's the entire point of this sub after all...
---
Is this on youtube?
---
the goal is get out of the starting zone ahead, and from that point it will be nearly identical circumstances, as nobody will be in the areas he's leveling in, because he'll be among the very first ones there.
---
Damn. Thank you for this story.
---
&gt; We do not know exactly how many players a Classic server accomodates. Based on Blizzard's hints in the thread it's anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 players.
---
So Blizz only anticipated 10k-20k people to play on English PvP servers across the entirety of Europe, that sounds like one of the most retarded things I've ever heard.
---
I'm right there with ya!!!  Gonna be fun!
---
Everyone gets cool server names.
---
I'm over here on fucking Arugal like "And I didn't even get a choice with this shit"
---
It really ruins the sense of server community. My guild had over 40 members online and I never saw anyone except when we was in a group. [We was meeting outside OG bank and I was wondering where's everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3LoEIpy1dU)?
---
I actually live in Chicago so maybe I should stick with the east coast servers. The technical difference doesn’t matter to me anymore but that’s too convenient now that I know. Thanks for the info
---
Look at it this way: Everyone started on Classic, why not you?
---
Yup, currently discussing moving over from shaz with my group. If we do go I hope we don't end up on an empty realm.
---
It also comes down to the speed of the weapon.  I think that’s why the cross bow from BWL is really popular
---
Also they consolidated a lot of servers during the downturn in Mists using connected realms which suddenly became overpopulated with re-subs. Its one of the reason they're hesitant to merge servers if they anticipate a fluctuating population.
---
"But I (read: 10 different guild members) have another group of friends yall don't know that want to play with us too"

Because your defined fire spec wont be taken into Molten Core. like at all. good luck kiddo go frost or delete character

exactly this! if they implimented a system to temporarily claim a name on stalagg i'd happily swap over

Owls and Wind serpents both definitely have those focus issues
---
boomers: “L.O.L. So true!”

I'm out of the loop here someone explain this to me; are they re-releasing WOW vanilla as in 'Molten Core is the end' or is it everything prior to TBC? Will 40 man Ahn Qiraj be a part of this?
---
I was deployed to Iraq right before TBC came out and my guild was, at that point, stuck on the triplets. Got back and could never get back into the game due to all the questionable changes. Would actually be pretty cool to go back and pick up where I left off :)

It was done by a Reddit poll for all realms. But I dont think something like that is very accurate, probably hugly inaccurate. You will really need server live statistics.
---
Troll are substantially better in pve (protip:pop berserking after eating a demonic rune for guaranteed extra speed). Orc is extremely good for pvp due to the stun resist- rogues, warriors, and paladins all rely on their big stuns to finish you off, resisting one will completely fuck them and allow for an easy win.
---
&gt; I always thought it was removed with the revamp of naxx in wotlk.

Only disadvantage I can think of is that the Druid is much faster outdoors. Feline swiftness and travel form vs. literally nothing.
---
I just wanted to point out that it has nothing to do with layering. Each layer will compose of at least a full server, so whatever that was in Vanilla or current dev's numbers. There could be 30 players or 2,000 and they would stay in that one area. In retail, with sharding, it's a different story as I've watched streams/videos of people trying to WPvP and people would disappear as there are too many people in that one area. 
---
I just wanted to clarify the difference between the two from my own perspective. I could be wrong but I've tried to stay updated on layering as much as possible.

I think it’s probably more depressing to be a journalist for The Onion...

That's why I'm gonna charge a gold per summon 😈 (gonna be playing with a full group of family/friends FYI)
---
I completely feel you - it’s frustrating having people say that they want to play on Herod because they think that the idea of there being long term massive queues is “just hype” even though all the signs are clearly pointing to it being a massive clusterfuck.

Think you can get it at lightshope.org

They are still EST.  The vast majority of the server population is going to start trash mobs when Johnny Central is just sitting down to dinner.

Haha cool names dude
---
this guy is a sellout and being a sellout pays big i remember him with 50 viewers way back when he was a true vanilla advocate then he started kowtowing to blizzard, signed by method and now he has over 9000 subs. DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE A GANGSTER
---
back when they said the "you think you do" line i probably would have agreed tbh. The game was really good then( i know it says WOD but this was before wod was out). its the 3 xpacks after that that really made me wanna go back to vanilla
---
I love it. Send him all our Horde comrandery
---
Yes. If there are still 15k trying to get in 3k get in and 12k go into queue. If it is that high they would almost assuredly offer free transfers to either a realm that lost a lot of people and is low pop, or make a new one to offer transfers to.
---
These names are whack

&gt; (No MCP/Sanc/JotC)

Seems like you missed the actual dps number for this alternative.
---
I'm curious how high SoR Ret can be pushed without MCPs. How would a regular spell dmg 1h work for comparison. Or possibly some proc weapon that scales off spell damage.
---
I know everyone always talks about how glorious it is that the you think you do guy had to announce classic, but in reality with how packed servers are Blizzard is just starting to realize how much money this will rake in the guy and J Allen Brack has risen to a ceo position, they're the winners in this.
---
yeah right
---
Cats with 1.0 attack speed and 2.0 attack speed have the same dps, all the pet's dps are normalized in Classic. Broken Tooth is only good for "pvping" against casters. For PvE leveling, 2.0 attspeed is just fine.

Go pve if you cant handle it

I don't think you're getting my point.
---
All im saying is, pvp-wise, you are way better with the orc's racials. Also you got a smaller melee range radius so if youre planning on going elemental, which you probably will at end game, you dont want a 7 yard range for people to melee you at.
---
Imagine knowing you said no one wants Vanilla WoW only to have to be the one announcing it haha....

Honestly though good on him for summoning up the courage to be the one to come out and do it.

WHY ARNT PEOPLE INVESTING TIME ON TOONS THAT GOT DELETED

Not only that... because bear is a percentage gain, when you pot in caster form and then switch back its actually like a 33% gain on health that you would have got from the pot if able to use in bear.
---
so a joke?
---
Well I'm responding to the original comment above mine. Just sharing my thoughts. Being offended is your right, but it's unnecessary.
---
It’s not about just getting new servers. They sent out the list. I coordinated with all my friends and worked hard to get my name I most wanted. I got off work today, read the news about stalaag and my name was already taken. Now I’m trying to communicate with my friends I’m saying hey it might be a good idea to change servers. But I have several different groups, not all read up on constant changes in classic so it’s difficult for me to explain this situation. they fucked up big time they did not release enough servers. They even say they want to keep the “server community” aspect meanwhile every server is AT LEAST medium which they state medium is already way more than full was back on release. Like what??? Why have early name reservations if you’re going to beg me to change servers two days later. 
---
I still like blizz I still want to play the game but i just don’t know where I’m going to play where i stand or what is going on with the community rn.
---
lmfao, that name is awesome

They're going to turn off layering by phase 2, they've said that. If they do layering in phase 2 it would be a disaster with multiple world bosses, split world PvP, etc. 
---
However, that likely means phase 1 could be extended, new servers made and free realm transfers, etc. They'll solve the population and overcrowding before releasing phase 2, which is a good thing.
---
Funny, I thought this was a title about your significant other, and your happiness is more important than them not understanding your hobby. I thought the dwarf there was yelling at her husband.
---
I had to take some liberties with this as the data isn't available en mass.  But I can extend to you how I baseline the information.
---
I assumed two different models and then attached probability ranges to them in the form of population estimations.  My baseline non variables in the models were estimates of activity by task.  In this case one model was 10 minutes average player access to create chars, the other model used 15 minutes average player access to create chars.  Then, unfortunately I was forced to take the liberty of assuming the average player would spend 4 linear hours logged into WoW.  We have to assume that for every person who leaves before 4 hours, another is playing longer or exploiting macros to avoid a queue.
---
This gives us some basic math to start understanding the queue mechanic of the equation.  So we can break everything down into minutes at this point to create a relative percent increase in time to cycle the queue. So with a baseline of 10 minutes for reserve, and 240 minutes for live estimate, we are looking at a 2400% increase in time to move through an equal queue.  Applying this number to the known estimated 20 minute queue time if you were one of the unlucky few who hit Herod at climax of \~20,000 queue, we come up with a live queue of 8 hours.  \[20x24=480 minutes\], but this isn't exactly accurate as there is a massive backlog due to the extended playtime of live. 
---
This is where things get complicated and I am still playing with models trying to represent population versus server capacity.  The issue comes into play when trying to calculate actual server capacity versus queue load when live, as stated above the extended play now creates backlog.  By my best guesses in its current state with available information, 6 hours was the shortest queue I have come up with, as stated, other models reach into the 26 hour range.
---
It helps that we now know from the post, that a classic "medium" pop server means about 30,000 accounts.  Which means a full server is &lt;60,000 accounts.  We know this because Argent Dawn in 2006 was the biggest server with 29,000 accounts.
---
Either way, the people who stick with Herod are screwed.  You cannot even tell them that either, they just down vote you to oblivion out of ignorant hope that your wrong so that no one else will see it.  They made their bed though, now they sleep in it.
---
Anyhow, that's just part of what I'm playing with.  I am sick of typing now, lol.
---
While I agree that blizzard should have done at least a couple more servers. They're basically telling the Herod hermits if they don't switch they're gonna have a bad time.
---
lol now thats fucking funny. i kinda miss that system.. a little
---
Queue time is based on people logging off no? On launch a ton of people are going to be on for hours and hours, so if anything I think the queues will go slower
---
Felt the same. I no longer care about Retail.
---
Stop it some of those changes were unavodiable.
---
TBC is propably the best MMORPG  has ever been created.
---
Good idea!
---
It is. Combat isn't green for PVP. Assassination and Subtlety are.
---
idk why you guys are laughing...... wont be laughing when youre in que watching everyone else play on twitch because you were too stubborn to switch to a different named server lol
---
There's limited amounts of modifers in wow, shift ctrl alt and ctrl+alt is all I believe. You can rebind the keys to the harder ones of those like ctrl+alt or alt. If you can't do it with the mouse software you have, then you can use the software Sharpkeys to do it.
---
I'd rather bring a warrior with nightfall than an enhance, and for ele you'll need to wait until at least aq when you get spell pen gear since there's no curse that lowers nature resistance. The whole oom thing is taken care of by fights generally being short and farming a *lot* for runes and any mana related consumable like food, blasted lands buffs, etc, but then you're putting in farm more effort that a mage/lock for similar returns.

The average age of a Classic player is an age where most people have a job.

---
10k+, i still dunno how i got my name reserved.
---
I seriously just had this convo.  7 people and the ONE dude won’t switch so no one else will switch.
---
is that 6pm pacific, central, or eastern time?
---
No I know he's right. I'm saying it should be common sense but their circular reason is from being stubborn
---
idk why people have developed so much server pride already when they literally havent played on the server yet
---
Yes I am sure that would work fine for WoW Classic and if it isn't fixed I will probably do that...but for me it's more about being able to launch all Blizzard games from a single pin (Battle.net Launcher), including but not limited to Classic.
---
No,  actually it's an opinion that non citizens of this country should go through proper channels to enter.  So that ar can verify to the best of pr abilities their intentions. 
---
Saying im racist is a personal attack,  you know nothing.
---
considering I got a swift spectral tiger during BC for 7k gold and that was about on par for the RL $$ worth, yeah 60k was a ton in vanilla.
---
But I love the names that I got on Herod!
---
I had a similar wood desk setup back in the day. Monitor size, not so much, but close enough. I hope Fred has a great time with his brothers and sisters in arms here on Herod. For the horde, brother.
---
With mellee leeway on the stress test, there was no way for hamstring kiting to work on my end, I've heard others have had the same experience
---
It doesn’t say anywhere you can’t. Other kits outside of combat and it’s heavy reliance on AR, are considered stronger.
---
Agreed. In cata you had the best system imo because most things on the tree had a real impact or did real meaningful things. best of both worlds would be cata style tree with a mop ability pick (1 of 3) every time you would normally get an ability in the tree (for example pyroblast)
---

---
No lie that's a very good idea. Especially because I'm sure they KNOW stalagg will fill up, but they probably need to turn to the Higher ups and say, "look! We filled up another server! Give us money for more"
---
That's unfortunate. You're going to miss out on a great game because of your willful ignorance.

Warrior leveling isn't that bad if you learn to hamstring kite units.
---
We had to wait for an hour during a BRD run cos our tank and healer (who didn’t know each other prior) wanted to make out on whisper after downing the golem boss. So we waited, cos it’d have taken longer to hearth out and find a replacement tank and healer...
---
This seems about right from past experiences just paying hardcore but getting distracted. 
---
I remember my rogue having 4-5 days /played after hitting 60 and thats with quite a few moments of idle afk. There are so many addons with guides out that I suspect a lot of people will be hitting 60 pretty fast.
---
I can't say how much I love this.
---
Hope he enjoys every moment of it!
---
I hope they add more servers before release. I'd assume that many more new players will come with the actual release of wow classic (without name reservation). And the servers are already full... 
---
Sure, probably a lot of people who come from the later wow expansions might leave after a few weeks of play. But yeah... I'm looking forward as to how the server situation turns out eventually.
---
Buying gear on the AH with spirit on it to heal my warrior faster.

naw it was after wotlk that it really started to go downhill. tbc introduced arena and much more class balance and more specs being raid viable. plus the lore was cool. wotlk added a new class and was quite legit as well but not as good as tbc or classic but still amazing. after that was much worse.
---
must have been some pear
---
I chose Fairbanks based off server location and avoiding streamer influence; being a noob I want an experience as close to release as possible.

Ruining the place with peple who actually played back in 2005? What we now know as "normal", used to simply be called "PvE".
---
Great for their time
---
It's not confirmed yet. We'll have to wait and see once people reach 60 if its possible at all. I think it probably won't be and that hunters will have to stick to mauradon farming. Would be good for us if it is possible though.
---
i used to love (love is definitely not the right word here) to go outside of orgrimmar and watch rogues duel each other. it was so funny when they couldnt find each other
---
No it's not warranted. Personally my guild is actually deliberately playing against them because it's fun to have good competition like them.
---
The problem however is that other guilds won't. People are dodging apes because they don't want to play against them, and people are joining apes on the same faction because then they have a strong "backup" so to say. This creates faction imbalance and faction imbalance is a downwards spiral. Once people hear horde is struggling none will roll horde. 
---
but they are keeping their server secret so that it will be harder for guilds to dodge them, which is a very good thing, because as long as people blindly choice their server, apes won't really impact anything. It's not like people are gonna quit a server they already committed to just because apes is on the other side.
---
I have my own house and shelter myself in the smallest bedroom in the corner. I guess it’s a comfort thing. It’s my safe pace.
---
I‘m not understanding that analogy.
---
If you think that third realm will be dead at launch you're delusional. Switching will happen and at least 1-2 more servers are likely to pop up to soak up the queues. Guilds and groups of friends will also start switching when half of their members can't actually play for hour after waiting this long.
---
My guess it that the majority of players haven't even joined yet. I still think the servers will naturally fill up on release. It's not like new players are going to chose the populated servers with the 20 000 player queue. Should they have added more servers initially? Yes. But I think it's a problem that will solve itself.

"Relative realm population will be visible in-game to help in choosing a realm so you will see Low, Medium, or High in the realm selection screen. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during name reservation and character creation, we will post warnings about the potential for queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms."
---
Blizzard also posted...
---
"As of now, a large number of WoW Classic characters have been created on the following realms. Players with characters on this realm are likely to experience severe queues at release."
---
Faerlina - PvP
---
Herod - PvP
---
Whitemane - PvP
---
And they posted...
---
"While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan."
---
"Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006."
---
I.e. make sure you are on one of the smaller lists as a backup.... 
---
No way the drop off is a big as Blizzard seems to be thinking
---
That was my thinking as well, lol
---
The point is for a smooth launch. Anyone stupid enough to choose an insanely full server after launch did it to themselves.
---
He loves these comments, thanks a lot guys!
---
wont happen because of realm queues and layering. fuck blizz

good meme :)

It is in vanilla wow, but it’s locked. If you stand by the IF bank in a certain spot you can duel there. Get a warlock to gear you and sometimes you can get feared through the wall and fall into there. We called it “Old IF” in vanilla. I remember thinking it was so interesting.

Cut them some slack. They're new at this!
---
Good luck with your queues.  From the new info its looking 8 hours plus now.  Make sure to remote in and queue as soon as you get to work.  There are going to be so many fractured guilds on Herod because of this.
---
If they opened up a fourth server, me and my gang would immediately switch. We all missed the opening of Gehennas so none of us got our names...
---
If you look closely, I purposely made it a really terrible spec - which would help the horde in PvP :)
---
I feel this big time.
---
I kinda wish there weren't all so many 'join our big 200+ member community that has been gaming together for 16 years!'. Seems like there's gonna be buttloads of large established guilds on every server from the get go, where's the fun in that?

title question : it really depends on the type of gamer you are. wow classic is a game where you have to work really hard for everything you have. the game will kick your butt and make fun of your mom. the modern wow is more streamlined . you get in get going 1 2 3 and done on to the next thing. there is challenging content for the people who want it but you have to want to do it where as in classic even leveling is going to be a struggle for some players. ( imo classic is better but look at the sub your on so what did you expect)
---
1. classic will be updated overtime just like it was at launch . way back when it was new vanilla added new content to the base game as time went on. new raids battlegrounds etc. the current plan is to release the content in 6 phases very close to how vanilla was so the progression feels like it did back then.
---
2. as of right now when asked about future content as in xpacs or branching off blizzard has said along the lines off lets see ho classic does and what the community wants. 
---
some ideas i heard were along the lines of release each xpac and allow players to move forward but also keep legacy servers for each stage for the people who want them.
---
Blizz as the technical capacity to raise cap and with layering itll be fine, but they choose not to. Fuck blizz
---
Rogue
---
God I hate what this subreddit has become.
---
Shaman
---
Paladin
---
Half the raid is going to be in queue now before layering is even removed.
---
Druid
---
and youve never gotten to 60
---
Oh it's the stolen vanilla meme with retail models lmao, I really like this image Lori, can I save it?
---
Hunter
---
Nope he does pretty good, 1-4, C, V, B, T, R, and his mouse has the shift modifier, so all the shift of those too. He tries!
---
I assure you Blizzard knows how many accounts are on each server and didn't overlook this lol.
---
I was always impressed by how faithful and adaptation that movie was — like that’s literally (minus a few changes like Lothar living) the story of Warcraft 1.

Been playing since 2006. Bought a 35” monitor and I am ready to  play Classic.

Oh..and I’m 68 and I’m ready to kick some Alliance butt!

---
This. This so hard!
---
What were they thinking when they opened the new servers...?
---
Being a support is rarely a rewarding or fun experience.  There are a select niche few gamers (5% maybe?) who enjoy playing the support bitch role.
---
When you get a progression kill on a boss, rarely do people say "wow the mana that shadow priest fed us the entire fight really gave us the edge", no, the response is "Wow look at our dps really pulling through in this fight!  And our heals!"
---
thats what guilds are for man.
---
yeah it would be pretty big dumb if they did xD
---
YOU ARE LITERALLY BEING WARNED 10 DAYS BEFORE LAUNCH. YOU ARE DOING IT TO YOURSELF.
---
BLIZZARD KNOWS BESTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
---
3 servers for PVP and the choices were Streamer Server, Herod, and Brazilian Server.  People flocked to Herod for some reason...
---
Several? 5 servers across 6+ xpacs. It's not hard to get a feel of your server's guilds with the various recruitment channels, server forums, and constant spam.
---
Thank you.
---
Its little stuff like this I'm most stoked for.
---
I cant wait to aoe level and amaze myself with how much cloth I get.
---
How’d he get 4
---
Good to see that they are smashing so many bugs... But a little worrying that 45-60 and the endgame content is untested.
---
Disabling layering for levels 50-60 would help, as per written in the original post.
---
This may be a dumb question, but why do people not want to play on a server with streamers?
---
Me too :)
---
On the flip side, I missed server opening on Herod and couldn’t get the names I wanted (without adding a few extra characters). I transferred with my guild to stalagg the day it opened and got exactly my names
---
Well dunno send him this discord link then 😂
---
Why not?
---
Happy birthday, Fred!
---
that's rad. my dad moved over to eve online and refuses to move back because he said he didn't like wow's pace
---
I think it would be the location of the server you'll be accessing to play and therefore the latency between you and said server.
---
If you're on the East coast and access an East coast server, you'll have less latency than if you access a West coast server and vice versa.
---
Weird, do you know why?
---
There was a poll on the grob subreddit.
---
[deleted]
---
now that's surprising to me.I like that a lot actually
---
I know that feeling bro
---
Yea I don't have any friends either. That's why I'm rolling Hunter, so at least I'll have a pet as a companion.
---
Until I forget to feed it and it runs away. I lost 2 pets that way on stress test before I finally found the location of the fish vendor.
---
lol roleplayer salt
---
Thats why they have this "we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so", they didnt put it on 20k even if they can, they probably went for 5~7, they know going too high will hurt the comunity, but they also want lower ques.
---
Well barleywine is the shit, so that doesn't sound like a bad problem to have.
---
I’ve got a razor death adder. What should I use?
---
It's more that it's a player-coded custom business program, I'm not sure it gets anymore German than that :D
---
Originals.  I think they remade them for BC but I think that was roughly when WoWhead launched so no need for paper. 
---
I had Wailing Caverns bookmarked for some reason.  
---
I also had a Guide to making WoW addons for a few things I made back in the day and have totally forgotten how to do again, but I think I lost that one in a move.
---
Honestly, it's a bit paranoid but a legitimate concern. No one knows what the population drop-off will be like after phase one (honeymoon phase). So their logic is, with such a big unknown, why not go with the biggest server?
---
They'll find out why when they try to play on launch week though.
---
Is using layer hopping to avoid PvP, mine resources, or farm rares bannable, or even reportable?
---
It was done easily during the beta. It would be very difficult for players to detect others doing it in to report in the first place.
---
thats what i mean and most ppl who are leveling wont need layering since it wont be crowded in those zones
---
Man I might have to go out my way to run it. One of my favorite map designs in any game.
---
I wonder what it would be like if everyone only got 1 name. Barbaric I know but still
---
Do you know if it would work with joycons? They technically link to bluetooth as 2 separate controllers but I like the size of the controller
---
And do you have the ability to do that?
---
Of course not.
---
Actually fucking impossible to disable it at higher levels.
---
Even if 1% of launch days population hits 60 within 2 weeks, that means there are thousands of players per zone.
---
Why would server merges ruin the community feel in the long run? Wouldn’t the servers get merged, have a healthier population and develop a long term community around that? It seems like it would suck in the short term but the realm probably already kinda sucks if it needs a server merge.
---
Yeah, pretty much. The raids were definitely fun, and in general I enjoyed the expansion, but the dungeons were so much more fun at the start when everyone was grouping up and running them socially with friends than when LFD came out.
---
tf did i read you base your rules on weird shit like race instead of like maybe how they act, if they try to make truce with emotes or something like that lol?
---
Besides the majority of that realm's players having different peak times than your own, potentially making finding groups, guilds, etc more difficult, the only other major difference is your ping to the realm's hosting location. All the PST realms are hosted in Los Angeles and all the EST realms are hosted in Chicago. Day and night shifts will also be different and events like the STV fishing tournament will be at a different time, but those are minor.
---
This is the one change I can get behind!
---
Rly tho most skills are partially idle.
---
Cant wait
---
At least I try, but my community, friends and guild are all German natives, so why playing on a English server?
---
It actually happened at the end of Wrath before Cata launch.
---
&gt; correct hairstyle
---
what that would be? i wanna make a troll warrior
---
I’m sure a few of the servers wouldn’t look as populated as they are. You bring up really valid points, honestly.
---
So, what, everyone chiming in with memories of this person is part of some conspiracy to... What? Fabricate belongings in a video game for street cred?
---
IDK why bliz thinks this is and tho overconvienience takes away from the actual game itself if you are just zipping around everywhere it sucks the life out of the journey
---
Because you don't need that information.
---
Ty, finally someone knowing his stuff
---
shift modifiers are the first step to being rank 14, i expect your dad to be the 0.0001% of Herod that the rest of the server looks up to
---
Probably would have worked better as a TV series.  Hell, they could just rip the script right out of the Warcraft games, each level could be an episode.
---
Well, I plan on skimming through quest text because.. you know... no more easy quest markers on map/world map
---
Hey all. A few months back, I made a phase 1 gearing guide for healing priests. It was well-received, but right after it was publish Blizzard announced how they'd be handling itemization.
---
So after doing more research and finding out more about the available gear, I created this updated phase 1 gearing guide for anyone planning to cap a priest early. 
---
Enjoy! :)
---
It is very satisfying and memorable getting loot in vanilla and a testament to how well they made the progression system. I also remember my first epic boe, it was Shadowblade and dropped in Corin's Crossing (EPL). Really excited to see what lies in store this time.
---
Have you played osrs?
---
ping , immersion , raid times.
---
you will have a slightly higher ping going across the country. prob a non issue tbh
---
the time of day will be a little off around sunset / sunrise as in game  does a decent job of matching real day and night
---
you will find more guilds raiding late night since there will be a 3 hour time diff. so 8 pm for them is 11 for you. i raided 11 - 2 with a west coast guild it sucked the next day lol
---
Thanks for the detailed response! Yes, I absolutely agree with all of those points. I recall enjoying the more streamlined leveling experience at the time, but at this point, it doesn't feel good. Cata was only a few expansions deep, so the pace wasn't too wack. But now, you ding multiple times through most zones before like, 60 or 70, and it feels really weird.
---
I think Cata was the point at which they really leaned into the "endgame is the only game" philosophy. But for some reason, they didn't produce much interesting overworld content, either. Having said that, I enjoyed Cata, particularly the raids, though Dragon Soul's recycling of art assets felt super lazy and it dragged on for too long. But all the raids were mechanically interesting and, as I recall, pretty challenging.
---
Mods have literally broken their own rules before by posting something that's not allowed, or leaving such posts up because they found them funny.
---
I wish I had proof but this was several days ago and I'm too tired to look rn. I'll see if I can find something tomorrow.
---
Thats the IRL character
---
I'm in the exactly the same boat man!
---
Full more than 1 hour, high around 1hour, medium less than 1 hour, low instant que is what im expecting, herod specifically i expect up to 3 hours on release unless players really understand what they are getting into.
---
Well fuckin done!!
---
And what about the level 60s?
---
Your dad is the real life Randy Marsh, and I say that in the best possible way!
---
Yeah I guess he realised he made a mistake back then... I needed to be fixed
---
alliance or horde ?
---
I'm playing it right now yeah.
---
you could get killed by 0 crocodiles tho.
---
The game doesn't have any kind of mechanic to tell you which shard you, or any other player, are on. If you need to trade with someone and you can't see them you'll have to group up and one of you will get pulled across.
---
It's the new pfQuest: Guide Lime
---
That's awesome! I got rid of mine because of the Internet. The only thing I kept were my collectors edition hard copies of the game expansions.
---
Lets say  the server can fit 30000 player, it doesn't mean they can handle 30000 player in the same place at the same time.
---
Imagine a stadium that can handle 10000 audience, but all of the audience want to sit in the west side of the stadium, its that kind of issue.
---
One of these things is not like the others
---
I probably should’ve elaborated in my top post a bit more:
---
My budget is around $400 USD, but because I know I only need the computer for WoW Classic and typing up recipes, I’d prefer to keep it lower. I originally thought to build it myself, but as the costs mounted towards my limit, I couldn’t help but think I was wasting money on parts that are just too good for my humble needs (in addition, I was afraid I would damage them upon attempting to build), thus I started looking at refurbished computers. Aiming to get one for the cheapest price I could, while still being able to comfortably play WoW Classic, and perhaps have some music going at the same time.
---
I came upon a Dell Optiplex 760 with these specifications for only $200 USD. I know it’s an ancient beast, but as long as it can run WoW it does everything I need. As previously mentioned, I am computer illiterate, I ran the minimum system requirements versus this computers specs in google multiple times, and while I was fairly confident it would be enough, I just needed to be sure before I pulled the trigger. 
---
If you could point me in a better directions it would be greatly appreciated, but as of now this seems to be the best deal I could find.
---

Not really, no.
---
SERIAL KILLA!!!
---
On the other hand, you can put one in the inn to get rested exp and then keep switching like this to be more efficient.
---
Well you can't fault me considering your reddit name is bongscoper lol
---
Definitely, my fondest memories of that expansion were running with guildies and randoms getting geared in heroics for 10m naxx. I'm looking forward to that again, I miss having to whisper people randomly all across the server to find people for a dungeon.
---
No, I don't need it. But it would be nice. Maybe someone will make an addon?
---
Been there but I didn't see any of the stuff I am looking for in this post.
---
If there was no layering with blizzlike pop there would be less people hitting 60 and less people farming all these precious items. 5 times more players, 5 times more tryhards, 5 times more people to spread it around with.
---
That's how fucking scaling works.
---
"we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so."  You got to be kidding me....
---
It's a role-playing game where you play as a character for hundreds/thousands of hours where people call you by that name... of course people care
---
Read the op
---
It could effect you being able to find a raiding guild that runs the hours you do. For example a raid starting at 6pm EST could be hard for a west coast player to make at 3pm. Not saying there won’t be guilds who run later but the majority of stuff will be based on that time zone. Other than that your ping might be around 80-100 still pretty solid but not as low compared to if you chose your own region.
---
Actually Mike Morhaime as he was retiring and putting Brack in his spot most likely told him to be the one to announce it and put his foot in his mouth and he was quite bad about understanding what the community wants.  Still to this day I feel the people in charge of Retail WoW are quite detached from the community and the core of the game and what it once was to a lot of players.
---
Yea, I always run with master loot. So I can master loot all items to myself. I am a Hunter after all, everything is Hunter gear.
---
Even maces and plate, they help my vendor spec.
---
Serial Killa by Snoop Dogg
---
YES
---
I have characters on a lot of servers I won't end up playing on. I literally have a character on 3 NA servers and 3 EU servers. I imagine a lot of other people are in a similar situation. So I count toward all of these realms.
---
Gr8 B8 M8 I R8 8/8
---
Yea when it comes to classic YOU HAVE TO DECLARE YOUR SIDE, not this dumb retail garbage where you have both horde and alliance on the same server!
---
100% this. Anyone who thinks group finding was in any way a good thing in classic is kidding themselves. It sucked. I did love the *result* of that system, with a much better sever community, but there was never anything fun about logging off after five hours of failing group finding without clearing a single instance.
---
I’ll be playing with friends and if I don’t have a good group to enjoy level 60 with I won’t be doing endgame. Been there, done that.
---
ugh not excited about that. not sure what to do now.
---
Reading posts about how FULL THE SERVERS ARE GOING TO BE IS AWESOME.
---

---
This is gonna be a shitshow, the real vanilla experience.
---
I'm just wondering why they dont' enforce a hard cap on the server
---
yeah my descent into marijuana use consumed my life, couldnt think of anything decent so i picked a word my buddy made up to describe players who did the 360 quickscopes on highrise in MW2. remember the 420 montages, at one point he said "im sick of these 420 bongscopers" and it just stuck with me
---
This is so bad
---
still, I have 3 characters on 3 different realms, and many did the same
---
Would having a larger community be a bad thing? As I understand it, it would build a stronger economy and create more oppurtunity to better experience the game.
---
Thats why you have to care how to treat us.  
---
Those dps wont come when you lie in the dirt.  
---
Pray to us and you might get what you desire.
---
I've been trying to play retail even with a video on the other monitor.  I just have no enthusiasm to do anything in retail like I did on the stress tests in Classic.
---
&gt; Never in vanilla did I see mobs instantly respawning like I have on multiple pservers.
---
And I said nothing of the sort. Read my post again and please don't downvote just because I might be wrong.
---
True that, but still insane there is people how devote that much time over that long period of time. I would burn out if it was me
---
Multi spec would change the game significantly, but I think substantially cheaper respecs would be a welcome improvement.
---
Nope. and its technically would be a game-breaking information, lets say your guildmate got shard C which only opens up when the server is overpopulated, if he has that information, he would just stay in shard C and enjoy free Gurubashi trinket, free nodes and quest spawn.
---
“Atleast I got my name” *twiddles thumbs in a 4 hour queue* Lmfao
---
Yes.
---
dope
---
I agree, I just hope they can find peace with it and enjoy a different server.  Many people are in groups that might be fractured from it.  It's unfortunate.
---
Use razer synapse to create a profile which activates when WoW launches, and then bind your mouse side buttons to ctrl/alt/shift in that profile
---
You dont have to deal with the queue if you never log off ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
&gt; 5 times more players, 5 times more tryhards, 5 times more items and 5 timesmore people to spread it around with.
---
Not exactly. If there are 5 times more layers, the absolute top and first levelers can get 5 times more resources by layer hopping, *concentrating* the resources. If those 5 times more resources were spread among 5 times higher population evenly it wouldn't have the same economic impact.
---
Blizzard already said at Chinajoy that each realm will support at least 10k concurrent players even after Layering is removed.
---
TBC added nice things but it also added flying mounts that made the world much smaller and removed wpvp.
---
The long term plan is probably ~3k, in order to reach that they need to overcap the servers at launch to absorb the mass exodus of tourists which will occur within the first month or so.
---
nope, shaman purpose is to wreck everyone in pvp and not heal or help teammates
---
They’re limiting the number of layers though so that when they get rid of layering, the numbers on servers are still playable
---
It can still be a noob friendly class with a high skill ceiling. Ever heard of the phrase "easy to learn, hard to master"? That's pretty much rogues. Any geared rogue can easily kill lesser geared opponets with the simple cheap-shot-kidney-blind reset. If geared enough, blind isn't even needed.
---
Rogues have always attracted noob players, "ninja" type classes are always popular, no matter the type of game you are playing.
---
Also wondering this
---
!remindme 2 months
---
I like to think he wasn´t the one calling that shot. But he had to sell it. Similar to that Immortal guy.
---
I imagine most people who are keen enough to be there right on launch day are keen enough to have subbed already. 
---
There will definitely be more players, but they’ll probably roll in slowly in the weeks following launch. They’ll see the queues and be pushed to the lower pop servers as intended.
---
The expectations is that by the time layering is removed, at least 50% of players have quit the game already. If not more.
---
Probably at least like 30% will quit before level 30. I think a lot of people are going to try classic because their favorite streamer is trying it and then get bored when leveling gets really slow and go back to their usual games
---
Hmm... Herod. If he managed to reserve 4 names there perhaps others have as well? Is Herod gimped in allowing more than 3 names for some reason? Would that account for its insane population?

Honestly, i'm almost 40 at this point, cynical, and I just want to find a mature group to go through this experience with, but I'm kinda clueless about where to look, and I worry that I won't be able to
---
what was that addon and website in vanilla that would inspect players in the background and let you upload the data to their website?
---
they did in pservers
---
Nice job mate :)
---
This guy also did it with barely any sleep. If you do 8 hour play sessions you can probably cut some time from the /played. Not viable for world first though.
---
god damn that's rough, hope you found greener pastures

Awesome man keep it up! Wisdom teeth and by the looks of it you gave blood too? Badass MF! Must be a fellow hordie :)
---
theyre level 60s. they dont need to level, they need ppl for epic world pvp events.
---
I'm not hype for that, but I am expecting numbers to drop when cata-babies realize welfare epics, heirlooms and LFG don't exist, zeppelin wait times are horrid, there's typically only one GY per faction per zone, and things come much slower. 
---
Not all will leave, but I can see a good number coming just because Classic is included in the sub, and they'll bail in due time. First week is going to be rough, but beyond that we should be fine.
---
Stealth makes so many things in the game possible, both while leveling and at max level. You can even sneak around the other faction's cities which is quite a lot of fun too. Playing rogue allows you to do and see things you just can't do on any other class.
---
That latency though
---
FYI, queue times will have started long before FULL.  Thats just blizzard trying to normalize metrics based on expanded data from Vanilla.  Even servers listed as medium capacity had queues during peak hours.
---
Gonna get this even though I don't speed run for lols. :D
---
There are examples of that. Especially because the gamer market, at its core, is an enthusiast market. Make a great product and people will throw money at you, sing your praises, advertise for you, and immortalize you in pop culture.
---
Isn't a long ass queue going to incentivize people to switch?
---
What is a layer made up of?
---
Thanks you just gave me flashbacks.
---
Exactly, it felt so flattering to hear from a tank in my guild that my name was being tossed around as a good healer to group with. The servers felt to alive and communal when you knew who the best players of their respective classes were, and the infamous ninja's and trade trolls
---
At first i couldn’t hear it. But then it hit me. Nice job man. 10 days left, GET HYPE!
---
I've been repeating the same better suggestion ad naseum for a long time, but people still genuinely think that layering is somehow the only solution imaginable. Don't believe me? Look 3 comments up this thread.
---
I'm wondering why the huge desire to be on Herod in the first place. Call me clueless but why are so many people wanting this particular server?
---
I dont retail. Old school wow player that's been fighting for classic to return. As far as I'm concerned we've already won and the kids will be back in school soon! Wooooo
---
CauthonLuck is such a sweet name. Praise Oden!
---
Barrens chat.
---
how dl you grind Ravenholdt rep without being a rogue?
---
Because if a streamer quits the server it more worthless becomes a dead server. Every where the streamer goes theyll have a massive crowd following them. The followers will help streamers farm mats endlessly. Trade chat just becomes twitch chat, etc
---
I don't think so, my mom, sister, and friends only got 3.

You are remembering wrong then. The current world record is around 4 days played as a hunter. That means no afk and only 100% gas pedal.
---
forums are somehow worse than reddit, they're going to be saying that even if everything says otherwise
---
I wonder how many people permanently rage quit because of that place.
---
Servers don't get put together anymore. That is bad for brand optics. You need to understand things from the business side.
---
Only situationally. Like if Druidy boy is already out of mana, you can use Viper Sting to prevent him from recovering. But if you're both starting from full, a Druid might use half of his mana before a Hunter is completely out of his. Then there's Innervate. He's just going to cleanse Viper Sting or go into bear form (can't drain mana while he's in form). You will run yourself out of mana before him if you rely on it.

This is huge, especially at the higher tier raiding level. It's so easy to dump threat on a rogue!
---
Layers are shards.
---
Yeah for 400 you could build a pretty decent gaming pc if you were only planning to play things like mmo's (classic)
---
that pc you posted def isnt worth $200 I've got a bunch of old dells that i paid 5 bucks for that are better.
---
&gt; Stop complaining about layering
---
Fuck that defeatist attitude, it's pathetic.
---
Wow, looks like I picked the wrong server.  I wonder if it is too late to reserve a cool name on Herod.
---
I look forward to this
---
Lol
---
Obviously the ideal is to just have the perfect number of servers right away and never have to do anything, but that's pretty hard.  
---
If you can't get it perfect, then either 1 of 2 things is going to happen:
---
1) you put out too few and need to have more added.
---
2) You put out too many and they are underpopulated.
---
I'll take option 1 any time given those choices.
---
I was being heavily sarcastic
---
Not advocating anything here, but they seem incapable of a lot of things. 
---
My buddy paid Chinese farmers to level a new troll shaman on a new account and he speed hacked everywhere and (I don’t know how) but ended up able to fly in places (this was pre-ZG days) and it took blizz like two months to ban him. 
---
(I don’t personally know anyone that got banned since)
---
With the amount of classic server traffic, I’m not sure tracking log ins is on their radar.
---
Yeah, that was my instinct, too. I'm no expert on smite priests, but from grouping alongside them in 5-mans, they seemed at least on par with a boomkin.
---
how bad was it? im terrified and have been putting it off and im in my 30s. most of my wisdom teeth are broken in half and hardly even there anymore
---
What's your better suggestion then?
---
thats his whole point. even if just the top 1% does it the economy will be much different.
---
How’d you go from new to wow to booking 4 days off?
---
It’s not about that at all.
---
Tell me - How does a Balance Druid AoE on retail? Starfall. (Amongst other things you pedant)
---
How does one do it in Classic? Hurricane
---
I said it is “the classic equivalent” not it’s exactly the same.
---
What kind of autism is this? Are you so dense that you cant infer what isn’t literally spelt out in words for you? 
---
OC: Hurricane....
---
Retard proof the ellipsis out: It should be Hurricane not Starfall.
---
Who the fuck doesn’t recognise icons this day in age? Stop trying to find fault and “be right” and just accept that this is a shitty meme, that could have been appropriate for this sub if the OP had just taken a little time out of their day, rather than copy pasting something from a different generation of WoW
---
where are the smartasses saying "blizzard knows better than you" now ?
---
I can honestly see Blizz having to open several new servers upon launch to retroactively deal with demand.  Glad they opened one now, and they should be looking into another before next week.
---
Good to see the devs trying to be proactive though.  East coast is not gonna be fun.
---
Haha my grandfather is also 71 and I think he’s going to beat me to 60 just because of the sheer amount of time he has. We’ve been playing together ever since WOW launched.
---
So it's a fail situation whichever way you go. Cool, thanks Blizzard
---
The "end game is the only game" is a direct result of them adding levels to the end of the game on each expansion, instead of them adding parallel leveling/items/class abilities.  
---
  
---
If I was in charge, and had a way back machine, I'd have the expansions come out as an horizontal extension, not a vertical one.  For example, while in the BC content, you'd have a separate level, gear, and skill tree that only worked in BC.  And I'd do all the other expansions like that too.  When in the vanilla area, you'd have your old level/gear.  You'd even have an independent bank with all your BC stuff.   BC would start at lvl 40 too, so you'd not have to start at lvl 1.
---
No, just obvious conclusion to visible facts, so you probably saw many people stating similar things. Thus the impression of repeatability.
---
LOL... howd he get 4 names!
---
My friend is a Warlock, I'm a Mage.  We will be running our own ingame uber business.
---
How can I repost something I made? Lol
---
Well I don't think its truly a matter of elitism its matter of as a per-structured group wanting to play among and against other per-structured groups.
---
Damned if you do and damned if you don't. And you think those options are fine? /boggle
---
The most populated server in 2006 was Argent Dawn with 29,000 accounts.  Just to give readers a point of reference.
---
Thats fine. I made my names on herod and then switched and got even better names on stalagg. I was in immediately on herod but like 6 hours behind on stalagg. No skin off my back what people do, I'm just happy to not have to wait in 3 hour queues for herod.
---
Hell to the naw
---
We’re going home boys
---
I'm sure you can find a guild that takes 5 minutes to kill MC bosses if you put your mind to it.
---
Thanks!!
---
Yes, name transfers should be the default for any server launch for at least a 2 day period before opening up creation of new characters
---
Their fans group up and are swarm them, assist them, give them preferential treatment, and the fan base as a whole is a general nuisance on the server. It's just not very vanilla-like and doesn't seem very fun at all.
---
14 servers good to go, and a million more on the way,
---
Thanks! And yeah I’m so pumped!
---
me too pls
---
I get ya. How would people who aren't overly into the RP thing, but willing to not break Immersion fare?
---
6 hrs/night
---
This 100%. Even without classic, if they took modern wow and got rid of all of the LFG and cross realm stuff they would probably pull me back in. It was always the community aspects of the game that made me enjoy it so much (which makes sense, because otherwise why not just play a single player RPG?).
---
ok but this has to be copypasta
---
That's not an argument to put non-Vanilla abusable mechanics in the game that will change the server dynamic and economy potentially well into Naxx patch.
---
Seems pretty weird to put a trial period on guilds for launch, when it's prolly 10-15 people making the guild and 25-30 new people aka ''trials''
---
The congestion will hit it's peak when layering is removed if you read the post
---
 Get that Elf out of my sights.
---
are you US?
---
Everyone go add him 🦑🦑
---
I’m glad you enjoyed it! And I’m rolling horde till the day I die! For the Horde!
---
It’s fun to see that despite hundreds of people clearing out the Frostmane Trolls in vanilla they are still a threat in retail...
---
Oh the days I remember getting that 10% roll twice in a row sapping stuff in UBRS.
---
If you get the gear and are really try harding, Smite Priest can pull 550 peak for about 45s.
---
This comment is so wrong it hurts to read.  
---
Hunters have the highest unique actions per minute of any class in raids.  Weaving shots and abilities requires effort that none of the other classes require.
---
It’s important to realize a lot of players will quit. The game requires tons of effort and no doubt a lot of players are just dipping their toes in the water. It will definitely be crowded but that’s fun for some people.
---
Ok thats just ridiculously cool
---
I played very little of retail wow but plan on playing classic is hunter a good class to start
---
A long time ago when I first went to the r/wow subreddit, I couldn't have imagined finding a subreddit with posts as unironically stupid.
---
Then I came here
---
They said they CAN support 10k, big difference.
---
I keep hearing this "The economy is gonna be ruined" argument, as if Vanilla WoW economy was some super balanced delicate thing.
---
First off, the economy back in the day was a massive shit show with insane inflation caused by gold farmers. Tons of bots were pumping gold into the game at a steady rate from continuously farming mobs.
---
Secondly, almost every argument I've seen about this layering issue boils down to farming resources. Unlike gold farming an increased amount of resources being farmed is GOOD for the average player. If people are farming Devilsaurs much faster than in Vanilla it means leather prices will drop and competition for spawns will dwindle much more quickly. It might mean that farming them for profit will seem less profitable, but in a market filled with resources (and less gold farming) the gold you get from it will stretch much farther.
---
Even if you want to try to argue that layering will allow early birds to farm up and then make a good profit down the line that's still a self regulating market. If you hold on to your banked resources too long the prices might just drop like a rock as the market could end up saturated with the overabundance of banked resources.
---
So I'm left wondering, what specifically is this cataclysmic effect that layering abuse will have on the economy ?
---
I’ll send you $10 of bitcoin
---
we're not talking about working the market we're talking abusing layering to gather many many many more resources than would normally be possible. 
---
have you been reading anything in this thread?
---
Any experience on what rp was like on the horde side? i'm trying to decide my faction and am leaning alliance but am open
---
I'm glad noone has flamed you yet. Brace yourself for the absolutely toxic community
---
I am curious what items do you think will permanently affect server economy
---
What?
---
Thats ok but that wont solve the 10k people still waiting in que at launch because layering doesnt do anything but make the world feel more empty more than it is with how low the cap will be set at.
---
That’s completely baseless
---
Yeah I’d much rather have too many people than too few, so I’m good with it
---
I don't know where you're getting this fake statistic but c'mon. For all the jokes in this subreddit, most people have self-control and most parents here know how to parent as well as draw boundaries. 99% of people aren't addicted to WoW the way you described. Most people shut off the game and go to bed at a decent hour. Most people don't fail out of school. Most people do their homework, get to work on time, and live normal-people lives outside of the game.
---
Your average person out in the world who isn't a gamer fills their time with something: reading, the news, television shows, sitting on the front porch watching the sun go down, motorcycle rides, boating, hiking, camping, fishing, et cetera. These things aren't any better than WoW. You ever had a friend with alcoholic parents? I'll tell ya one thing, I know some people who would have had a much better life if their parents had spent evenings playing WoW instead of downing their weight in alcohol every night.
---
I get what you're trying to say, and I'm not going to try and argue that there aren't shitty parents who play WoW. There are. There are shitty parents at Wal-Mart, too, though. And at home, right now, ignoring their children for an episode of whatever's on the telly while they work on their dozenth beer.
---
"I really need to do X" (and then not doing it) can be a sign of laziness, mismanaged ADHD, or a general lack of self-control/time management. Maybe all of the above! I see nothing wrong with opening discussion on these things, and maybe how to manage time and ADHD better, but posting what you did on this guy's post when he's just excited to play with his kiddos is in pretty poor taste, especially with pulled-out-of-your-ass statistics.
---
For every scrub who fails a grade or a class or gets fired from work, or for every neglected child due to a shit parent who just happens to play WoW\*, there are probably several thousand well-adjusted functioning people playing this game.
---
\*Let's not pretend they wouldn't be a shit parent no matter what they were doing lmao.
---
Hence layering. Man, they thought of everything.
---
I don’t about this survey. But it’s interesting for sure. ~50% play TBC as last retail and only ~25% have active subs. So this is clearly a very skewed poll.
---
I don't have hours to wait just to login to a server, but I also don't have an interest to play this game without my friends..  Seems like I won't get one without the other.
---
It won't be so fun when you are lagging out trying to get to BRD. 
---
Don't expect any summons with how busy the entrance will be.
---
How are you more likely to run into that lvl 10 mage again without layers? It's still the same amount of players on the server with or without layers.
---
Say that they have 5 layers on a server. Each layer is said to be as big as a vanilla server, which had a dynamic cap around 3k. So with this layered server, there are 15k players online at the same time. Blizzard still predicts queues much higher than 10k. So, for arguments sake, say a queue of 20k. That's 35k players trying to play on the same server. With layers, 15k will be playing, and 20k in queue. Without layers, 3k will be playing and 32k will be in a queue. That lvl 10 mage will be one of the 35k players no matter what. In fact, using some these numbers, there should be about 10% chance of you being in the same layer as him, and about 10% chance of you being online past the queues at the same time as him.
---
Personally, I think that they will let in alot more than 15k per server. And if they let in 30k on a server with layers, instead of a 20k queue, you'd have an additional 27k players in the queue on the same server without layers as there would still only be \~3k players online at any time. 50k queues anyone? And the more layers there are, the less likely you are to see that lvl 10 mage again, but also, the more layers there are, the bigger the queue would be if there weren't layers. So the chance of both of you beating the queue at the same time would decrease aswell.
---
FOREVER
---
Great job beta tester!
---
Can anyone recommend a video that is consummate classic/vanilla WoW that I might send to my friends who haven't played before? I've played for so long and am so attached to it that I have little idea how to describe the game, in part or in whole.
---
There will be a massive number of tourists. There will be a massive player drop off when most of them leave. The idea is on no way ridiculous.
---
Lol.

Our focus is to have a flexible main raid group that will be able to make steady progression through the content during each of the phases. We also welcome members focused on pvp, or a more casual game style to join our community. 
---
 **Expectations** 
---
Respect the community, and respect the rules. Our community is friendly to players of all types, but we will be expecting good attendance and play if you are seeking to join the main raid group. 
---

---
But the medium realms having more than 4k today could be due to the presence of layering.  He is just saying it would be good to have clarification if the 'medium' is representative of how many players are expected to be on each layer/the final layer.
---
Yeah everyone would start fresh. There would be no real catch up.
---
If you were to try retail, then there would be some catch up but it's not a big deal. It's a huge world and you should take your time to enjoy it. Just having a subscription will allow you to play all of Classic and a HUGE chunk of retail (apart from the current expansion) so it's probably worth at least to check out.
---
What an ignorant post lol
---
See you in Brill, Fred
---
- Gnome Mage
---
I heard this topic being discussed in lots of Classic WoW streams like Kargoz, ClassiCast, etc.
---
There doesn't seem to be as much conversation about it on reddit. Maybe people are purposefully keeping it in the dark because it's going to create some very big winners unlike ever has been seen on a Vanilla server before.

---
Simple, people will see a 3000 queue, then decide they want to roll on a lower pop realm.
---
Somewhere deep down I fear they'll find some excuse to keep it. Instead of turning it entirely for phase 2 they'd only disable it in areas where world bosses spawn.
---
This isn't Blizzard we're dealing it. It's **Activision**-Blizzard. Not exactly a company I trust.
---
Epic bait
---
As recently as WoD(the last time the game saw immense queues) you could login in the morning, go to work, and still be in queue when you got home.
---
My favourite moment was when I was being chased by 2 skull alliance with my Druid named Freewynd and they were on mounts. They were closing fast but I was approaching the coast and got there in the nick of time with my heart pumping trying to avoid the gank.  They were persistent and tried to continue to chase me in water so I went deep in seal form.  I kept trying to cast roots on the one and getting resisted but I got one to stick while keeping range on the other. The roots broke and he was frantically trying to swim to the surface so I cast roots again. It was resisted but was able to cast one last time with him being a couple feet from the surface and was able to get the roots to stick. The one guy died and I started after the other guy but he ran away, not wanting any part of this water fight.
---
You realize the early character creation is actually really helpful. Imagine having just the first few servers at release. You'd have to wait so long just to get in. Now there is a chance they will announce even more severs.
---
Vanilla realm caps could be as high as 3.5 – 4k as confirm by Mark Kern (Grummz) here  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Tfo1QTo.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tfo1QTo.png)
---
Yeah, what?
---
because sometimes people like things that you dont.   
---
Welcome to planet earth.
---
You’re not new to the internet, are you?
---
If you're relatively "solo" at the moment, and don't have any strong affiliations with RL friends playing and haven't signed up with a guild already, this is actually a really good time to switch to Stalagg. I was able to get some prime names that weren't available on Herod, and hopefully won't have to deal with as many tryhards and queues that will surely plague Herod.
---
The whole premise of this discussion is based on overpopulation of realms after they remove layering thus creating server queues at launch.  It's difficult to understand why you're thinking layering will be a solution to the post layering population issue.. are you suggesting they don't remove layering?
---
So go respec.
---
Thank you sir!
---
Awesome!!!!! Keep it up :-)
---
I’m not restarting my sub until classic... no point in retail for me. Too grindy without feeling like I’m actually doing anything.
---
I've been playing since late 2001 and I only ever trained while having something else going on in the background/foreground. It's more like giving yourself a babysitting job, lol. 
---
Doing 3 hours of homework? That's 100k fishing xp.
---
Just activate your sub. Reinstall WoW classic will be available. No need to purchase any expansion.

Pretty much, I haven't played since wotlk but everyone says it's just a hub now and unless you raid mythic + there's really no point to being in a guild
---
Funny how people say it‘s because of the money. Not the fact that Arnold exercises.
---
The money did help him with his post steroids era though.
---
Just subscribe. That's all you need.
---
In a database, the name does not need to be unique. I'd laugh at anyone in the health care industry that used names as a unique identifier. So people could have the same name because two names of 'CL60' aren't how the database tells the two characters apart.
---
Although I don't know how they'd handle the whisper system, which does rely on a unique name. And since no one wants to type in a GUID or something, I can't see a better system personally. Account name, but what if someone didn't want another to know their account, only their character name? Meh. They won't change it anyway, it's a moot discussion.
---
I think they had an aneurysm.
---
Goosebumps for days. Nice.
---
This.
---
damn man fucked up if true lmao
---
That is awesome. I would love to have one of those little guys on my desk. Wow.
---
If you just want to play classic wow im pretty sure you only need to have an active subscription
---
Well they already said medium realms are bigger than Full realms from Vanilla.  I can only imagine how much bigger Full classic realms are.
---
nah having a complex passive tree is never a good thing
---
*boots up Path of Exile*
---
Install battle. Net.
---
Log in. Recover pass if needed. 
---
At launch of classic add subscription. Done
---
You’d compare the moon landing and some wow screenshot?
---
I would avoid those, as well as "guild formed by group of 8 close lifelong friends, join us" types of guilds.
---
Major streamers are going Faerlina and BR are going Thalnos
---
I know someone had mentioned ClassicWoW+ content that was new to classic wow and not in any of the other expansions. I don't like changes but if the community could vote on content being released it would be amazing. OSRS is nearly top grossing on play store with a healthier pop than rs3. I think it could be great. I think classic as it is will last for a very long time. But everyone plays at a different speed and everyone has different engagement levels so its hard to tell when would be the time to poll new content. If there's ever a right time for that.
---
No, he is ill because he has a wesk heart. He is ill because he used to have an unhealthy lifestyle and most importantly:  He looks ill.
---
But without layering the queue would be way higher than 10k.....
---
But has there been any mention of queues being layer specific? I just figured they are still based on overall server cap not layer based...so comparable to retail realm queues for the most part.
---
How?
---
I kill only hunters and any horde using savory deviate delight. Only alliance deserves the sexy human model
---
Considering that the original population was based on hardware limitation, I think that the server cap after layering is removed will be more than 4k, mainly due to better hardware today.
---
Nostalrius and other private servers have proven this, but I don't think Blizzard will go as high as those. If I was a guessing man I'd say somewhere between 6-8k.
---
But I agree that it would be good to have more clarification, and hopefully in the reddit AMA we find out more
---
Hey, don’t yuck anybody’s yum.
---
Right? It doesn’t say that at all. They’re just making their own interpretation.
---
“Click”
---
I mean, YES, ass and sub are the premier pvp trees, but...
---
AR, improved sprint, blade flurry, improved kick as an option... 
---
Combat rogue is nothing to scoff at in pvp.  I'd pick one in a multitide of organized/bg and world pvp scenarios over many other classes that are pvp specced.  I'd say they are worthy of a green.
---
That's extremely awesome to hear and I might actually consider coming back to a game I haven't played for 15 years. Thanks!
---
This was more of a celebration of WoW in whole. I didn’t know about this whole faction merger thing on retail and it was hot topic /shrug
---
Blink twice if UPS is holding you hostage.
---
This has always been common sense to me..... which is why pvp servers in true vanilla are nothing like the monster pvp private servers.
---
I have no interest in a pvp server 3-4 let alone 5-10 times the size of original pvp servers, the game world is not built for real world pvp.
---
I seriously love you.
---
Probability math isn't intrinsically obvious to most of us. You can play around with this calculator to get a feel for it: https://www.calculator.net/probability-calculator.html?cal4pa=0.03&amp;cal4par=26&amp;cal4pb=0.03&amp;cal4pbr=26&amp;calctype=series&amp;x=77&amp;y=27#series
---
Yet they still use the same archaic naming solution... are you implying that WoW populous means it shouldn’t use it? I would say the opposite is true. Since you don’t want to have to message 10 different people with the same name to find the right one.
---
😂 exactly
---
fuck off
---
There is definitely rubberbanding when too many people are in one area. 
---
It happened a lot in 8.2 when you went to certain areas, and that was with sharding.
---
I'm most excited for launch day threads of Herod players complaining about their queue times.
---
He's talking about how they're not raising the server caps for when layering is off. I don't see how people are interpreting this any differently.
---
Yeah, I'm 36 and most of my people are 30-45 we are all original guildies who never lost contact with each other.
---
Blizz might delete one of his characters at random and he'd have nobody to blame but himself.
---
If Classic restarts the cycle it won’t be on Blizzard this time, it would be Activision forcing it on them.
---
yeah but that was a small price to pay for better pve raids, class balance, and arena/eots
---
&gt;**A small portion of** the BR community going to Classic has stated
---
FYFY
---
One thing to keep in mind is that everyone most likely made 3 characters but won't be playing them all, not at the same time at least, so you can pretty much reduce the pop by 2/3.
---
Yesssss that’s what I’m talking about!
---
Pretty much lol
---
How is that server supposed to get down to a population that’s fits onto one layer before phase 1?
---
I do remember someone saying 3-4K per layer
---
Eh not if you enjoy the AH or server community / name recognition. The 2.5k cap back in the day was great. The shit on Nost was out of control. Just check any large private servers AH and you'll see what I mean.
---
I do not agree, people are not asses for you not being able to help yourself when it comes to harasing people. Just dont do it and grow up.
---
yes, one of the best duos i think.
---
Not every mmo uses it and I could care less about every other mmo.
---
Not true, read blizzard post
---
&gt;and will blacklist any BR folk trying to be toxic/unfriendly.
---
Just like the previously "proposed" 'streamer blacklist' and the ongoing 'anti-streamer blacklist', it's ultimately pretty pointless. The vast, *vast* majority of players don't go on any forums, don't go on Reddit and frankly don't care about these community arrangements, they just casually play the game. There isn't a large enough drive to keep these things going or to have a noticeable impact, for every Brazilian player that will keep to a 'blacklist', there will be 5 that don't care whatsoever about their reputation on said 'blacklist'.
---
Aaand, delete post
---
&gt; The thing we actually need to know is how big realms will be in p2 vs the original realms.
---
*Bigger*.
---
They are answering that question here:
---
&gt; Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.
---
The old server was hard capped at...what? 3,000? The new server hardware is - due to advanced technology - hard capped far higher. A server that is low might still feel just as crowded as a High or Full server back in the day.
---
I know that’s supposed to be a joke, but it’d honestly be super adorable. 
---

Guilds, Mythic raiding, and Auction house are all specifically realm only. Now traditionally there’s been more impactful things like battlegroups and non-sharding populations, but I also have to consider what you’re arguing. 
---
Blizz has nerfed the entire meaning of what a server is, and so a dead server is really only dead if you care about certain things. AH, Mythic raiding are basically why I play WoW, but I could see why you might not think it’s “dead” in the traditional ways servers have died.
---
When it was released, Vanilla was for causals. Hardcore played EverQuest or Ultima.
---
Let's hope all the hunter boys are ready to go without an epic weapon for the first 3 months because the Leaf is P2 and the other MC weapon drops are crap for hunters
---
Will of the Forsaken for tanking
---
I have been saying this for a while. Off chance you have a few guilds who consider themselves "hardcore" that get 10-20 people in that decide to stick with the server. Otherwise, people will see hour long queues and say "meh" and just go to a different server, meet new people, and move on from Herod. 
---
Same with Faerlina and the streamer fanpopulation.
---
The guy makes a lot of sense. You could even apply a similar logic to major brands in your local supermarket. 
---
A brand starts out and initially gains tons of success. Then the brand slowly sells out its name in order to continue growth. 
---
The brand eventually loses its name and is not known for its once great value.
---
I enjoyed reading. Thanks OP
---
Similar thing for my group. About 10 people and those of us that cared about name reservation all made 3 on Herod, then when Stalagg dropped we made 1 on Stalagg and kept 2 on Herod. But one of the guys is now adamant we stay on Stalagg and has removed all chars from Herod and refuses to go back. Meanwhile I'm expecting them to drop another new server on top of Stalagg and I think we should all go there...this is a huge mess entirely because they had to start off with so few servers...obviously they needed more. They've done nothing but underestimate when it comes to Classic...
---
Can I have one
---
Put a queue wait time estimate next to the server pop. If it says something like  'Log in wait estimate - 3 hours', that'll make people think twice. And create servers that are open open to character transfers off the full pop servers.
---
Yep. 3 days and 19 hours I think - dudes a beast. He also got a lucky drop (Dwarven Hand Cannon), so that helped him a bit...
---
They've already made more.

FORTH EORLINGAAAS
---
I have, no where did they dispute this.  They said they plan to remove layering regardless of server pop.  The only possible result of this is longer queues.  
---
The question is, did you read the posts?
---
That would encourage even worse overpopulation
---
It’s worth pointing out that leveling as assassin is very doable. I did it to 60 and had a blast. Not using daggers just seemed less fun to me.
---
Exactly. This.
---
Fuck yes I’m so glad I chose to be a part of the Grobmob
---
If your name is so simplistic and unoriginal that it is taken quickly and often.... then there is much to be said about how simplistic and unoriginal you yourself are.
---
Just found out punkrat is going there on the alliance...
---
It's cause no one wants to play with streamers... Why would they
---
Seriously though, it is my favorite place in Teldrassil. It is incredibly dangerous and I always wait until I am at least lvl 10 before I even venture near that place. And everyone you meet will group with you (at least on pservers)
---
Thread for the lazy. http://imgs.fyi/img/8qxt.png
---
Not that you could buy.
---
“Blizzard knows more than you”
---
But apparently they didn’t realize opening so few servers to start would mean a ton of communities would be entrenched on one server and then refuse to move.
---
&gt;Login queues in excess of 10,000 are a certainty
---
I don't understand this. Isn't the point of layering so that we *don't* have login queues? I was under the impression that we wouldn't have any login queues until layering was removed.
---
This is an RP game of course people are gonna care about their name are you serious?
---
Hunters don't really have any gear competition, especially on Alliance.
---
The only other mail user is Shaman, and only enhance would compete for mail gear. But even then Hunters generally use their raid set anyways, which is Hunter specific.
---
Rhok'delar is a Hunter-only obtainable bow with a high drop chance in MC (well, the quest item does anyways).
---
Ashjre'thul typically has Hunter priority in most as well, since Striker's Mark from MC is a better stat stick for other classes.
---
The only things you really compete for are accessories. And melee weapons too, but those are just stat sticks anyways.
---
Dunno. I can't say I don't care about names, but I can say not nearly as much as most here. I didn't get any of my top 5 names, and just kept cycling through.
---
 Would I stay on a server like Thalnos for my name? Hell no. Would I stay on a server that I have a cool name on, and seems like a decent server? Of course. 
---
P.s: I also think it's funny when people say others stole "their" name. Not sure how they decided they owned the name, especially when it's things like "Bug"
---
They launched new servers already and some weren't full.
---
&gt; Vanilla was for causals. 
---
Now imagine 10 year later as they REMOVE what little RNG it had....
---
Someone confirmed the eye of shadow was in the game during not this, but the last beta. Was a post on here
---
Overpopulation isn't more people in the game, it's more people in the queue
---
Sorry bud those ques arent going anywhere. Anyone who reserved a name is gonna keep playing most likely. So when layering ends best of luck to the herodians. And they deffff wont go after a week.
---
If you can’t beat them join them.  At least that’s how I see it, and usually people feel the same too.
---
&gt; The answer is clearly 'no'. Is English your 2nd language?
---
No matter who is wrong or who is right, one thing I do know is that you are a jerk lol.
---
What did you have...? .1 of a coin ?
---
Don't worry I drink only 100mg of caffeine a day :p
---
It clearly states they will leave caps because when they remove layering that would cause problems if they didn't durpin
---
I fell asleep in Molten Core while holding down W and ran straight through trash pulls into Golemagg. Woke up to everyone wiping.

Be a man and convince your homies instead of blaming Blizzard. Blizzard is doing us all a courtesy and you spit in their face and blame them for your disorganization with your friends? Wake up.
---
will the real /u/FranklynTheTanklyn please stand up
---
I think its how they get away with gaming for a long time with families around. This way they are present with the family while the family watches TV. If a kid does something funny (like trips and faceplants into couch) the gaming parent/parents don't miss it (depending on focus anyways).
---
we love overpop

Do it! Only have to pay the sub fee $15/month it’s going to be a great time! :D

A friend scored like 3sec by chance, time for my revenge
---
Had to do with the lag i think name reservation was laggy as shit.
---
I also had both factions by accident.  I corrected it a bit later because I'm not looking to exploit a bug.
---
Yup, they should have just started with an Arthas story
---
No, I absolutely got it. That's the joke. So you whoosh.
---
Beastslaying to fight all them hunter pets in your face?
---
The problem I see and why I think Blizz is being extremely cautious is that all you need to reserve a name is 1. Having a WoW subscription 2. download a 5gb client. 
---
there are what? 2 million paying customers for BFA? how many of them are going to reserve a name play for a week, decide they don't like it and then return to retail?
---
to be honest, I rather have them be this cautious than have dead realms down the line of having them be forced to merge realms.
---
&gt; So if you want to avoid this, listen to their warning and switch servers now when it's a lot easier to do.
---
This. It is a *lot* less punishing to switch servers now, trust me. Even if you might only get your second favourite name on the new server. Once you are on the server and you're settled in gear and ready to raid, levelling again on a new server will be a pain.

---
There is still a cap per server, and they explain in the post why they don’t raise that cap.
---
Yes, layers do. But the issue is what might happen *after* that...?
---
yeah its not like classic is addicting or anything
---
Flash bombs break a druids neck. It's not hunter specific, but on a hunter its even more severe as the druid is f-ed when you get him into a cc chain
---
What hiders it isn't layering itself, but the amount of players that are the cause of the layers. 
---
Say that there are 50k players wanting to play on the same server the first few weeks. With layers, you split them up in different instances. Without layers, you have 47k people in a queue. Let that sink in for a moment. What are the odds of you seeing the same random player twice? Hell, what are the odds of you two even being online at the same time, and not in spot 42987 in the queue? 
---
Yes, layers won't help you see that random dude again, but you won't be any more likely to run into him again without layers when he's 0.002% of the playerbase. It's next to impossible that you'll have a random encounter with the same guy wether you have layers or not. The problem is the amount of players. When he's one out of 50 000, the odds are abysmal. With layers, atleast you will have a \~10+ queue rather than a 47k queue.
---
The only thing I could see solving this is spreading out those 50k on multiple servers. The less people on the server, the more likely you are to run into them again, layering or no layering. However, Blizzard won't do that because they don't want dead servers when the tourists go. And since alot of people refuse to change to the one other server they've opened, I doubt that opening 5 more servers would do anything good.
---
You champion
---
&gt;molten core sneks
---
In keeping with the theme, the next servers will be named after infamous Ninja Looters.
---
I think there is a wait timer. I have a group that is trying to coordinate a server, and we really can’t identify whether medium vs Full is gonna have a significant difference in queue and lasting potential.
---
Where are you rolling? I'm not super confident I'll find a great group of people, myself, either, but I know there has to be something out there somewhere. I'm pretty picky about the kind of people I spend my time with, though, so that makes it harder.
---
NGL thought he was going to draw a penis
---
Then why tf did you make this post man lol
---
I'm buying 6 month sub :)
---
Sounds more like a technical limitation turned into a design decision.
---
50k+?
---
10/10
---
Same class but switching factions
---
blizzard's not advertising.
---
blizzard please advertise!!
---
the servers a full
---
blizzard starts advertising
---
uh-oh
---
Clearly ..pvp servers with absurd amounts of players would be a totally different experience.
---
Lmao! Hopefully it will rise again while we are all distracted :P
---
Thank you, this still shows other game versions, but they are in fact classic versions. Thank you!
---
and publicity. If they shut down servers it makes news.
---
Daggers sounds okish, but the dagger talents are imp backstab and opportunity, and then whatever you want. Hard to think of that as an assassin spec.
---
Ion ballparked it at “a couple of months” for Phase 1. It sounds like they want to do the first two relatively quick and make the rest of the phases longer.
---
Right, so what you said isn't true. They won't have any extra issues when layering is removed. Closed case. Gavel
---
I feel no jelly.... only pity that your name is so unoriginal and bland.
---
I’m doing everything the opposite of my previous experience.  Horde this time, on a pvp server, on a class I never played in vanilla.
---
This post is basically:
---
"Ok so i read something on the forums that blizzard posted and i took that tiny piece of information and blew it up into something thats completely made from my own imagination, but ill preset it as fact nonetheless =))))))"
---
wait i got baited tf is that haha
---
214k and some change, has to do with the 32-bit integer limit. The first time I saw proof of someone at gold cap was in TBC but it wouldn't be that crazy if somebody did it before then. It's definitely going to happen in classic, if the cap is lowered down from retail.
---
So once you set up a queue and it gets into character screen, you won't get kicked out for inactivity? You can jump in at any time? Cause I have work on launch day, but as you said, I want be ready to play once I'm back home.
---
can i have one
---
Actually it would be on us the players because we know damn well it's gonna happen again yet we play and pay.
---
This time when it does happen we don't pay or we are to blame.
---
yup and people that were on the fence will be logging on so they don’t miss out
---
I think isn't normalised right so it's very wep speed dependant. Might need someone to confirm for 1.12? Hemo MSA was definitely a thing, although by that stage i can't imagine why you'd run a dungeon.
---
&gt;Paladins have to farm 5-10 MCPs for every raid to perform optimally.
---
&gt; This is also why the 811 dps number is unreachable in realistic circumstances: You'd have to get a new Lifestealing enchant for every boss :)
---
Color me a classic noob I guess, why is this?

It took months of organization and diplomacy to get everyone on the same page for one day.  It's not going to happen again.  We were perfectly organized and all got on the same server.  Now we're told that server may have 12 hour queues.  This is not our problem, this is Blizzard's problem.  What courtesy have they done by releasing too few servers and cramming us all in then telling us to get out or else?  Wake up from what?  This was a completely forseable thing that happened.  We all knew 24 hours before picking names that Herod was going to have a massive population because of Streamer Server and Brazilian Server making Herod the only EST PvP server.  Blizzard knew this too and decided not to release another realm at this time.  We figured they knew best and they had it covered.  Turns out it's a complete shit show.  How can you defend what they did here?  It was a completely obvious disaster and now you're saying that I'm disorganized because I can't get 6 different networks of people to move from the server we all agreed to?
---
Top tier chat advertisement.
---
Would apply 10/10
---
It's people. People are connected, guilds, friends of the people in the guilds, friends of friends. Before you know it you have national communities, interconnected guilds, entire private servers etc all wanting to play or at least be together on the same realm.
---
Let me clarify; you're not on a different login que on a different layer
---
It's almost like Blizzard has a consistent track record of waiting until two weeks out to do any serious advertising.
---
According to the GM Shazzrah will have an 10k+ queue on release, let's say that 50k(I'm just guessing) are able to play at the same time.
---
The game releases at a bad time so the people online are there to stay, so unless there are any disconnects you would be in queue for 2h+.
---
(or maybe im expecting people to be sweatier than they actually are)
---
Yes!  Arthas's story is so good and so easy to tell without going into *what* the Lich King is or who Ner'zhul was with any depth.  
---
The Culling would have been fucking amazing to see on the big screen.
---
My names will never be taken and I doubt will ever be randomly chosen in my lifetime. Plus,  I just looked in the armory, retail, and only my characters showed up.
---
Now,  they are important to me because the 3 names I reserved, already had a subscription, are the first 3 characters I ever created in Vanilla and BC. They are my WoW identity. I'm hoping,  if I get super lucky, that old friends I lost contact with remember my names and whisper me if they see me. If they don't then my names don't really matter since I'll be playing with all new people. Though, getting called the same name on voice chat in classic and retail will make it easier. xD
---
Fuck you and your shitty at get this garbage off the sub
---
LOL my naxx geared rogue says otherwise, scrub.
---
Take my internet points sir. It's all I can offer.
---
Should be good. Almost any duo is good.  Go feral and shadow
---
So what's the problem with Stalagg? Is it just that you might not get your name?
---
I couldn't give half a damn about it but if thats what you wanna do go ahead.
---
That default UI makes me want to carve out my own eyes.
---
I bet if all 7 of you switched the last guy would end up switching out of FOMO with yall.
---
.... I want to know who got 'Your' on this guy's server.
---
I can always tell when someone never played retail Vanilla WoW, but played lots of Private Server Vanilla WoW.
---
From pvp to pve, from alliance to horde.
---
I like shooting myself in the face so I'll roll feral once again
---
I don't think you understand, population and server capacity are two entire different beasts.  As soon as the layering is removed, the allowed population also goes down, extending the queue.  I'm not trying to be ignorant here, I'm literally speaking the truth.  These servers do not run on hopes and dreams, blizzard has a target allowed population end goal.
---
Quit in 2 minutes and uninstalled but try it out if it makes these 10 days go faster
---
That’s why they’re talking about queues on launch. They’re using layering to address the launch bubble, but they’re still putting limits on servers so populations don’t get out of control.
---
Yup, Illidan's story is another good one.
---
They just want to make sure servers fill out before they release another. They're thinking long term so all the servers will have the best chance at a healthy population.
---
a rogue trades the lockboxes to you i think
---
Not rolling on herod but whitemane, so likely still gonna have big queues. Bonus? University starts this monday, so queue times just means I have less of a reason to procrastinate haha.
---
&gt;impossible 
---
Enjoy the queue
---
Yeah, I hear ya.
---
Nah I’m the only one that is pushing against the dude.  I’m like 65% ready to go solo and jump servers but I won’t have anyone to play or level with lol.
---
I love this, thank you
---
Still works. Just tested it today.
---
+1 Paladin  for stalagg
---
I'm about to post the math on how long Herod queues will be.  I've been crunching numbers for three days.  Today Blizzard slipped and gave me the one item I needed to take probability out of the math.
---
I remember going through the opposing cities; sapping flagged players and blowing /kisses
---
To be fair, I also felt like you were implying that
---
I also choose this orc's dead wife.
---
no you said wotlk, whereas wotlk was actually the PEAK
---
I honestly don't know. There is a timer in game. You could probably set something up to mirror your computer screen to your phone and at least long in and jump every 20 minutes or so.
---
Never played on a RP server.
---
But how are the rules enforce , for exemple : How can you stop someone from excessively grief or troll in pvp ?  
---
I'm curious about RP... been watching a lot of GTAV RP on twitch and im hook , even tho I'm sure I will suck lol.
---
I think there will be more people in a month.
---
Yes they should have launched with minium 20 servers. Yes they should have gave more notice about stalagg server. 
---
But now it's up to you, try to move your friends or deal with 6 hour ques. Truth be told at this rate I'm worried that we'll all be dealing with ques come launch day.

Anyone who knows anything about Osrs knows that botting is on a whole different level..... the fact that you even used it for a comparison shows you either dont know such, or you know such and attempted to make a comparison with false logic.....

\&gt;  10 days to wait with no satisfying outlet. 
---
Make 'fan-art', like everyone else (even if it's terrible stick figures).
---
There was in vanilla, so one can assume there will be in classic, however blizz hasn’t released any details on it yet
---
If this was week of release I would agree but these numbers are not mainly from newbies.
---
Excellent trolling
---
Yeah that part... Not feeling the fact they're charging 2004 prices for a 2004 product in 2019. But we'll see.
---
Don't get it either. It was a nice addition, but most of my names are a "take it or leave it" thing. And I am a roleplayer, so I should be obsessed with making my characters.
---
Thing is, the choice is keeping a name or spending nearly an hour each day in the queue...
---
It was doable in 1.12 so it has to be doable in Classic
---
Blizzard needs to add at least another 6 Servers, I do not think they realize whats coming.
---
Also it doesn't make sense, currently whitemane is full and fairbanks is high, why should west coast wait for an east coast server to fill before getting a new one? If there isn't a new west coast server, it's going to be guaranteed that both of them are going to have login queues at launch.
---
Yeah. I am not sure either. I am not a native Spanish speaker either, I am still learning and found an appreciation for the language. I think I only notice is now that I am learning it and enjoy the immersion.
---
LF (Vigormortis) on Herod or Stalagg LF Player With my Vanilla Name (Vigormortis) Please Send Tell if you have it.

cheers.
---
(Vigormortis)
---
Typically, PvE realms have fewer people playing than PvP realms, and, while they're still full of life and people to play with, there generally aren't many queues. But, given the low server count, it might just be untrue this time around. We'll see.
---
Be reasonable and don't go fanboy mode pls.  There will be massive drop off.  Blizzard needs to be realistic to account for the future health of the game.
---
Extremely well edited, loved every second of it. The hype is too real.
---
Amazing
---
Why is that crazy? Your name is the only thing no one else on your server can have, why shouldn't it be important to you?
---
No, you're speaking of the written interview in English from John Hight, I'm speaking of the live spoken presentation/interview in Mandarin.
---
I'm comparing u to people that deny the moon landing indeed. 
---
"you can never be sure!'
---
'cant trust these pictures/screenshots'
---
'it's been a long time!' '
---
'In all seriousness, no one knows if the moon landing really happened'
---
That's totally fine. Generally the norm these days is to get a desktop PC for gaming, and keep laptops for travelling/work/browsing and non-gaming. 
---
While you might see a lot of "gaming" laptops for sale, they are extremely poor value for money in terms of performance, and make all sorts of sacrifices as a result. I cannot stress how much better a desktop is enough. You also aren't the first person to be space conscious. You can build extremely small desktop PCs these days - one example here:  [https://i.redd.it/18lt9za930d11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/18lt9za930d11.jpg). 
---
If this option is of interest, (tech illiteracy aside) Building a computer yourself may seem daunting, but they really are quite like lego and not nearly as difficult to assemble and get working as you might think. There are of course, lots of companies out there that would do it for you. 
---
In terms of budget, its pretty hard to say, many computers of many prices will run world of warcraft classic, at varying different levels. I would expect to spend about £550 (probably $650) minimum to run games OK at OK quality settings. A laptop of similar performance will easily go over £1050. 
---
My advice, decide whether you could cope with small a desktop if it was uninvasive enough. IF no, then for sure, consider laptop options. A lot of people do stuff like mount their screens on arms [https://www.kareproducts.com/images/main/418D-Monitor-Arm-mn.jpg](https://www.kareproducts.com/images/main/418D-Monitor-Arm-mn.jpg) to keep desk space clear.
---
as a wrath baby i look forward to seeing how my class was before i joined. i did get to see the old world but it wasnt the same as vanilla by that point it was just something you had to do as fast as possible to catch up to the other players. this time im going no addons reading every quest and fully experiencing the world as it was
---
Yes
---
I'm waiting too, as well as a couple of friends.  No reason to pay for time you arn't using if not worried about the name.
---
Yeah, but the cap will not be changed "While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further,"
---
Except it isn't the same game. In fact, the version of Classic we're getting is nowhere close to the version that released in 2004. 
---
Every class has different talent trees. Many abilities scale or function differently. A lot of the gear has different stats. 
---
And the source code they're running on is completely different. Wallwalking isn't possible in Classic but was in Vanilla, as an example.
---
The social aspect is different as well. People are more experienced, more informed, more connected. There's more tools available to improve gameplay too.
---
Classic is pretty good remaster of Vanilla for sure. But it's not a clone. It's different enough to be classified as a new game.
---
Not sure how to feel about this meta surrounding Herod that it's the 'serious' realm, while being competitive is fun, I wouldn't neglect the appeal of a bit more social or laid back realm, which I honestly belive it has more retention power and embodies the true spirit of vanilla rather than going through Joana's leveling guide or ticking BiS items on an excel file.
---
“Blizzard pinkie promised so they for sure will do what they said, definitely won’t go back on it when the situation is way different than they planned!” -someone brand new to Blizzard-Activision
---
It's easy... They will make queue times worse than they should be until enough people leave Herod.  Suck it up buttercup.
---
If it‘s total war, how is killing low levels and civilians (NPCs) ok? Those are war crimes.

---
i wonder, if blizzard intentionally denies access to tens of thousands of players who had access to herod at phase 2 for no reason, does that become a legal issue?
---
That's 7 more friends then I have
---
wrath baby here so im looking forward to how my class was berfore i joined up
---
People use keybinds in osrs too. Switching between the Special attack, prayer, magic and inventory with f1-f4 is necessary for certain slayer tasks and pking
---
He is talking about Herod being full, and not raising the cap to introduce more layers for it's current population.
---
Huh? Classic was announced back in 2017. Mike Didnt retire until late 2018 before Blizzcon. They have no correlation with each other.  He announced Classic because he was the VP for WoW at the time.
---
I think 2-3 names is fine, but it should have been 1 name per server.  That way they could choose a server while getting closer to the release date in case they wanted to swap.
---
That is what I did I saved my name on 3 servers one of them was Whitemane me and my friend agreed on but with the heavy influx of people to it we decided to go to a different server a few days later.
---
Orc for PvP. That stun resist is the real deal.
---
Troll might just pull ahead in PvE. Berserking is decent.
---
Orcs also get 5% damage bonus for their pets, which is nice while you level up as BM.
---
Same class, same faction, but going to try to stay more casual this go around. I just kind of fell into a raiding guild in Vanilla, didn't go looking for it. I had a ton of fun but I think I want to take a more laid back approach this time, less in-game obligations.
---
Also, thanks for being civil, to many people go full tard on here.  Haha.
---
That one is fine as gameplay goes though. Feels right being busy during the day and sleepy at night.
---
I'm wishing it were the other way around. I want to be outnumbered.
---
You could always just stay away from any guides and.. you know.. read the quest texts..
---
Not hard for them to put in a cookie to remember preference.
---
Blizz stated they have extra servers on stand by
---
It's really not that difficult to setup Teamviewer and AutoHotKey so that you can get in the queue and stay logged in long before you ever intend to play.
---
I think it is a male undead.
---
&gt; What we now know as "normal", used to simply be called "PvE".
---
don't make me repeat myself
---
If the name is popular, there is much to be said about how good it is. Simple names are the best, I had an 'original' name in vanilla and it sucked, people couldn't pronounce it half the time. Stop pretending you're some creative intellectual for picking names so shitty that no-one wants them.
---
Good luck chasing them.
---
Same thing happened to PoE
---
I mean, the hand full of servers is because they can save money on server space or sub drop. Who knows when that will happen. The day 1 release annoyance isn't worth saving a few dollars on the number of servers. Layering technology pays for itself. I think they are banking too much on this technology that I think will come back to bite them.
---
It kinda sucks to be honest, but you'll get through it. Some people have different reactions. As far as general pain, it wasn't bad to me. For some reason my throat got irritated during the process and I could barely swallow, so that was what made it pretty awful for me.
---
Anyone with half a brain knew they were going to release too limited amount of servers... The trick is to aim for a lower pop server instead of going to the one that will be full. Not hard to figure out. Even easier to fix...
---
You still have like two weeks. Get on discord and ask people if they want to play WoW or wait in a lineup? If they want to play the line up game, stay on Herod. If they want to play WoW, switch to a lower pop server. 
---
People with the other half of a brain will listen and move... It is pretty straight forward. I realize it is not ideal, but remember... Blizz could have just released the game with no information about servers until lunch day. This is a courtesy. You're welcome. Organize accordingly.
---
I'm with you... who gives a crap? Just pick something else.
---
main, alt, and bank alt is how i did it...took 3 names that i know will atleast see some use
---
    When participating in communication of any kind (chat, voice communication, group finder), you are responsible for how you express yourself. You may not use language that could be offensive or vulgar to others. 
---
I get what you're saying, and profanity filter and the ignore list are tools for people to utilize, but the language is pretty clear in that you are responsible for the things you say and how you express yourself. It's not another person's responsibly to use the profanity filter and that most likely will not be a factor at all when it comes to a support agent deciding on how to respond to a report against your account. Context may matter, and there's usually a pretty clear line that most people know to avoid. Crossing that line puts your account at greater risk, but you can still get hit even if you stop yourself just before that line in the same way a cop can issue you a ticket for just going 5 MPH above the speed limit.  
---
Your only real guarantee that you won't get in trouble for violating this rule is to just not violate the rule, as is the same with every other rule.
---
idk why ppl enjoy this type of shit show pvp. it’s not fun at all . if u get focused at all you die instantly. and everyone is just basically spamming rain of fire/blizzard.
---
On the most recent Pservers I was on, Krono$, we were killing MC bosses in 30 seconds before BWL came out. Now this was with 1.12 dungeon gear being available.
---
It took them till 2007?
---
Rainforest left hangin all these years
---
A rogue that's poorly specced for pvp will still do pretty fine against pretty much anyone but pvp specced and/or skilled opponents. I played a rogue in vanilla and never bothered to change specs between raids and battlegrounds and my gear and class carried me through quite a lot of them.
---
Yea but there are morals. It‘s pathetic if the fight is no challenge.
---
You think the que will be longer without layers, correct?
---
Well, they could be right (maybe not *die*, but lose a lot of people).
---
If I based a restaurant off of its first week of being opened, I would think it's everyones favorite place to eat.
---
Skewed to what?
---
because there are thousands of people that want to play with friends on herod but havent spent the money on a sub yet
---
The war stomp is good for pvp but hunters already have plenty of tools to death with kiting anyways
---
How DARE you suggest even a single change to Classic! Everything must be exactly how it was! Including the 6 hour queues, random server crashes, and 7 fps in Ironforge on a good day!
---
nah, you're good mang
---
Hahahah
---
needed that sick glow lmao
---
Its gameplay and system design lends itself to short term tourism, and is a chore for long term investment. It's a Frankenstein of contradictory design philosophies that don't blend well with a large scale RPG.
---
Fuck! Man! Who's cutting onions!?!?
---
You can use flairs to filter reddit. Never see a post flaired "art" again.
---
I think both subs could learn from each other anyway.
---
Only if tourism doesn't die off the way they think.  If the population holds, then queues will expand further when layers are removed.
---
Perfect slap dat ass
---
MMDDYYYY
---
this is what happens when people flock to realms solely based on realm name.
---
So whats ur plan when stalagg is full?
---
Definitely going herod now, cant stand this anti herod shilling.
---
2 months for phase 1? Classic isnt being tailored for hardcore guilds.  The casual player will hit 60 in 2 months. Then another month to gear and attunements.  Then 2 months for raiding.  I would bet my life phase 1 is not that short.
---
Yep. I transferred there to try to catch it having missed it on my original server. It was a ridiculous hour too, like 2-3am.
---
You're thinking only an hour?
---
I imagine it took them even less than that, was probably in some Cata press release from 2009 or 2010 or some shit and they pulled it out of the draw on some wanky flash drive and used it.
---
Yeah only one minor issue is the 10k people stuck in login queue who are majorly PO'd while there's 3k actually logged into the realm. Post layering removal ofc.
---
Imagine being so carefree with your money that you spend $8 on a virtual name you might have been able to get anyway without spending the money?  2 weeks to do nothing but put a name on hold in a server that you might end up not playing on anyway due to wait times, and then having the audacity to call other dumb.  Mind blown.
---
You think Mike simply decided "It is time for me to retire" and simply walked out of work the next day?  Mike Morhaime built Blizzard from the ground up with a dozen people he calls friends; he knew he was retiring in 2017 he probably even knew started planning to retire when Metzen quit in 2016.
---
Because those low levels will eventually become high levels and compete with me and my allies for resources. By killing them and their quest NPCs, I forestall their advance and give my allies more time to get ahead.
---
Try TukUI and Leatrix Plus it covers the first two number. For number 3 try Domino, it changes to your hotbars to whatever you need.
---
Why don't you join Stalagg and stop making shitty shit posts.
---
I always use the same name, its recognizable and people who ive played with or against always message me. if they've played another game with me, i think ive got about 15 discord message from people playing classic WoW so far. I even got a message from an Anthem dev who said he played Planetside with me like a decade ago.
---
The issue is for many its already TOO late to switch. They have gotten multiple different groups that have played together over various years together in one spot. Reaching back out to all of them reorganizing all them is a feat. Also people got their names.. if they want to switch it means they get to lose their names possibly. 
---
The only way to make this work is to DELETE all character reservations and set another day to reserve characters on new server names. Now that sounds insane but it is the only way this you are going to fix this.
---
No one is going to the new servers because a lot of us who played in vanilla or TBC experienced low pop server and its awful.
---
Prot is a tank spec, Fury is a DPS spec, Arms is a PvP spec.
---
My friend Steve just paid a guy 15 bucks for the name "Steve"
---
Now there's no imposter Steve out there running around on the server, there can be only one.
---
Oof
---
If you really think the very top players in OSRS are botting then you clearly don't know much buddy. Most people competitive with EXP know eachother, or know of eachother. Especially when a lot of them will stick to the 2200+ servers, the botting is rampart but thats really something that is prevalent in the middle-levels, most of them get banned before they are even close to having impressive stats.  
---
No having 99 fletching isnt impresive btw.

You do understand the type of heart surgery Arnold had cost a lot of money, also the fact that this is a genetic disorder? Exercising and eating right is always good but it has nothing to do with the ability of doing a 5 day caffeine filled binger. Also Arnold made the choice to not take care of it back in the day because it would slow down his career.
---
As an Australian nothing triggers me more than 'fuck off we're full'
---
RP servers are more about being a mature player. Writing complete sentences and not writing like a 15 year old, not being too crazy into min/maxing, stuff like that. I am also think that people on RP servers gank low levels slightly less, but that should also apply to you.
---
Generally a more wholesome experience

Ehh, I played rogue originally, played rogue on nostalrius, and will play rogue again. I've dabbled in other classes, they just aren't as fun for me.
---
For the love of god up vote this shit.
---
I’ll have one alliance... because I want a paladin... lol
---
What??? How is that even the same??
---
Your guild was obviously a highly dedicated guild (going for world first kill) obviously you have a lot to gain by transferring and abandoning any other out of guild friends on your server.
---
What does the average Joe gain by moving? Simply less queue time. I'd rather wait in a queue if it means getting to play with all the people I've already coordinated in to Herod, we aren't a guild just a bunch of friends.
---
This isn't even a bad suggestion. Blizzard is asking people to move off Herod, it ain't me complaining about queue times. I'm only going if I can bring my buddies with me.
---
You realize people are more efficient with a proper work life balance right?
---
2080 ti and 9900k here, u sure it will run??? I need confirmation before running out to buy some new parts to get ready for launch
---
I don't see why they would need a standby set of realms, when they could just utilize them at release. Seems counter intuitive.
---
He starts with a lvl 10 scorpid from northern durotar, then switches to a lvl 13 cat in Barrens. At level 25, he tames a level 25 wind serpent. He might tame another cat in the 30s, but I know he tames broken tooth at level 37. Not sure what he does from 45-60, he might get an owl in felwood, but a hunter main might know more than me. This is just based on catching bits and pieces of his VODs.

Up until this year i always thought that icon was a red-skinned dude with a moustache and a big grin. I'm an idiot.

Well when your my group and get names like six, spy, prime, trophy and all...

Nothing is going to switch us from Herod.   
---
Q times we are used to because of classic so they will die down when people decide to make characters on launch day and its a 2 hour wait so they go stalagg
---
And Sword spec with its chance to prove an extra swing.
---
The guy?  He's Mark Kern.  The Mark of Kern is named after him.
---
OMG I miss that talent system. It was a black day when it was removed.

I'll admit that i have always clicked. Makes no difference,  I've cleared as heals and tanks most heroic raids including LK and up to sunwell in BC.

Even went back and did the mage tower for all tanks and heals in legion.

Play how you enjoy
---
listening to his stream he seems to have some strange ideas about diet though.
---
/u/timmy_cj
---
I decided to crunch some numbers because I was curious about your claims. Here is what I came up with:
---
Suppose 10,000 players per server with 5 layers with 2,000 players per layer.
---
Now the tricky part because we can't actually know what rate players will reach 60 so I am going to use the wow classic survey results. I know this is flawed because it only takes into account people who took the survey but it did have 40,000 responses which is greater than the 10000 on our server so it is possible to think of a theoretical scenario where 10,000 of these respondents ended up on the same server so the statistics from the survey hold. 
---
Moving on...
---
According to the census 11.9% claimed 60 in 1-2 weeks and 23.1% claimed 60 in the first 2-4 weeks. This account for 35% of our player base reaching 60 in the first 4 weeks.
---
Part 1 (weeks 1-2): 
---
11.9% of players reach level 60 by week 2 and begin farming the layers. This is 1190 players. Since there are 2000 players per layer it is highly unlikely all players could be on the same layer but lets suppose they do in order to calculate our upper bound on farming. Keep in mind these farming numbers are assuming that all 1190 level 60s fit into one layer and have perfect layer hopping with nearly perfect timing as for each layer to have equal amounts of nodes available. This means each of those 1190 players could effectively farm 5x as many mats.
---
Part 2 (week 3):
---
The amount of 60s is effectively the initial 11.9% of players plus half of the total 23.1% census's week 3-4 levelers. This is 11.9% + (23.1%/2) = 23.45% which is nearly double the initial amount at 2 weeks. This means that now those 60s can farm at most 2.5x as much mats (half of the initial 5x amount).
---
Part 3 (week 4):
---
At this stage 35% of characters are 60 meaning that 3500 players are level 60. They cannot fit all on one layer, similar to our 1190 per layer example above lets say 1000 60s per layer meaning that 3.5 layers are farmed out at a given time, so we have this situations:
---
Layer 1: 1000 60s farming
---
Layer 2: 1000 60s farming
---
Layer 3: 1000 60s farming 
---
Layer 4: 500 60s farming
---
Layer 5: open
---
chances are by the time one layer with 1000 players farming finish the 500 players on another layer will likely have finished. That leaves one open layer that 1000 players will compete for meaning 1000 players are getting 2x the amount of resources. This will continue for a little longer until eventually there are 5000 60s in which case 1000 60s will exist per layer and the high level farming areas will be saturated. This (again, according to census numbers) will happen at week 6.
---
So in total, with only farming and perfect layer hopping and perfect node timing:
---
For 1 week (week 2-3): 11.9% of players will gain 5x the amount of resources that they would normally farm.
---
For an addition week (week 3-4): 23.1% of players will be able to farm 2.5x the normal amount of resources that they would farm.
---
For 2 weeks (week 4-6): 10% of players will farm 2x the amount of resources that they would normally farm.
---
The net resources in the economy that otherwise would not exist without layering is not enough to break the economy in this instance. If the farmers sit on their mats (removing themselves from participating in the economy for the particular resources they farmed) demand goes down but only until they use all of their resources (they don't have enough resources to last until phase 6 as your "permanently affect" claim implies). If they decide to sell/corner a market they will only have a small amount of potential buyers as very few 60s will be purchasing those items immediately. As more players reach 60 the initial gouging will pass until those 5x/2.5x/2x excess mats are sold and then the market will reach an equilibrium long before phase 6 (again, as your "permanently affect" claim implies).  I would love to hear your well-formed and mathematically backed arguments but judging from your responses in this thread you have not provided any sort of rigorous arguments involving math or economics.
---
Somebody needs to bitch slap J across the face.
---
Rather see low effort memes than a bunch of fuck heads who think we care what names they got or people using the sub reddit as their personal blog
---
If it wasn't for rep I would probably grind my first 60 since have done most the quests already.  I grinded a hunter to almost 50 and felt like it was as fast as questing until about 40ish, then slowed a bit...probably slowing again post 50 but didn't get that far.
---
Dont worry about that other douchy comment. I dont think there will be a legal issue that can manage server population how they wish, and you have access to other servers if you dont want to wait the queue time.
---
Why would that happen though? The idea is that layering will be necessary to keep the 12k people trying to log onto each realm happy and then be removed once two thirds of them are gone.
---
I already have.  I'm trying to save people the trouble before it happens.  Unfortunately there will be many casualties of groups due to this queue time.
---
I’ll be Stalagging it hard af come the evening of the 26th!
---
10k queue wont take long with layering.  10k queue @phase 2 will be bad.
---
Also a warlock, would like to join on the business end, flexible reliable hours, real life uber experience and I love WoW Classic.
---
Unless they came post nerf.
---
Got my names but had I not I would have just come up with new ones. Certainly wouldn’t get bent out of shape or buy the name off someone. That is batshit insane.
---
$15 a month to play the game is one thing.  $8 to attempt to get the names you want to play with is an entirely different thing.  $15 for 15-20 hours of entertainment a week is amazing value.  $8 for a few letters on screen is a rip off comparatively.  Spend your money how you'd like, calling others dumb for not wanting to spend theirs is not necessary.
---
I don't even understand what you're trying to say. If they kick tens of thousands of players off the server in p2 when layering is taken out? Because that wouldn't happen. It would just be a longer queue, and/or allow a free server swap.
---
and where shall the germans spread out to? open some servers plz
---
Heres some info about all that stuff https://wowclassicpriest.wordpress.com/
---
It’s literally impossible to be carefree with $8. You could do anything with $8 and there’s a case to be made that it was worth it. I couldn’t care less about reserving a name but I pay to support the games I love. 
---
I understand not everyone can do that, because like you, they are sad and broke.
---
20 days /played in beta so I dont think so
---
There are positives and negatives to Dungeon Finder but in my opinion the game lost a lot of the community aspect when you could just click a button and away you go and that is something you should never sacrifice for the sake of convenience.
---
Fun story about Rtiual of Summoning: the first guild to kill Garr in MC had a rogue agro the boss and then get summoned to the front of the instance. The adds ran back and Garr came all the way to the rogue where the killed him.

You're gonna die if you try to take the Menthol boat to Ogremar. You want to go to Hammerton, then fly to LordIron. You can find a goblin airplane there that goes to Ogremar.

Yea they are totally being douchbags for their innocuous comments.
---
Relax timmy, feel sorry for yourself for getting so worked up lol
---
that Celine dion made the clip lmao.
---
Except Stalagg will be just as full when the other 80% of players come at launch. Maybe even MORE full, because they will see Herod is already full, and massively pack Stalagg. Good luck

Why isn't there a link to all the previous class Fridays?

\[A\]\[NA\]\[RP-PVP\] Looking for a raiding focused guild.
---
4-5 RL friends coming back to enjoy the original experience again. We are looking for a home for all of us on Globbulus on the Alliance side. We have never leveled Alliance in our time playing WoW. We would like the guild to be laid back and mature, with some seriousness sprinkled in there for raiding. We aren't expecting a hardcore raiding guild, but we all have extensive raiding experience in all facets of end game raiding from vanilla to cataclysm before we went our own ways with the game. We will be leveling together so we will have a tank and healer with 2-3 dps classes.
---
You started a year too late to ride the classic gravy train
---
I honestly never understood why people rolled on RP realms with no intention of RPing. Honestly never really thought on if rp servers have strong communities or not since I've never really played on any other kind of server in years and years. That's rather interesting.
---
I've managed to use my name (not my reddit one) going all the way back to the North American launch of Final Fantasy XI.  Its just always been a core part of my gaming identity. I've used it in Furcadia (don't judge, it was 1996 and options were few) EQ, Eq2, GW1, GW2, FFXI, FFXIV, ESO, runescape, Wildstar, SWTOR, BDO, Archeage, Eldevin, Ryzom, Chronicles of Spellborn, COH, Secret World, Second Life, Allods, Eve, Fallen Earth...god I'll just stop now. Lets just say probably every damn MMO possible, even some mobile WoW knockoffs like Order and Chaos Online. 
---
Over time, I started seeing more and more people using my name or some variation of it. Which was odd, because to this day I don't think its a name of anything in pop culture (books, movies, etc) but it is a character name (not an object like "apple" or "bubblegum"). I've played every MMO throughout the history of MMos. So maybe I was getting an unintentional follower base, or started a movement of some sort without trying. I used to be a leader of a PvP guild in both WoW and Rift... so who knows, maybe part of me was rubbing off on young impressionable youths who wanted to be like me when they grew up.
---
 Somehow this user name keeps getting more popular with time. So anyway, yeah nabbing it in any MMO is somewhat important to me, it states that the ORIGINAL _X_ is here, and yes you are correct, it IS that player you were in awe of in that other game.  Anyone else with my name is a knockoff, even if they obtain the original spelling of my name, I was still first. I will always be the name more than any other who aspires to have it.
---
No speculation, the math is there.  Feel free to dispute it but it was easy once they made that post.  Right now, your just ignoring in hopes that it's not true.  Ignoring it doesn't make it go away.
---
The cycle of life can be cruel!
---
It's not hard to figure out really. Streamers will probably ruin w.e realm they choose with drama and bullshit and the BR community, even if they are fluent, often refuse to communicate in English.
---
Upvote solely because you said “read it, then downvote”.
---
You don't have to go all the way to Bounty Bay. There's a goblin airplane in Gormal that takes you to Ogremar.
---
There's no way they're going to dedicate this much effort to it. They're just making new servers, as needed. And when people see hours long queue on launch day, some people will just roll on a server with no queue.
---
* We don't know what the cap will be
---
* They are allowing more people in than the vanilla cap now because they expect drop off later when layering is removed. Doesn't mean the max cap won't be 3.5. It's possible they may raise it for classic.
---
* 6-8k isn't "huge"
---
So when the server lists were released and people complained about potential realm population will be too high, they didn't listen... And now they are admitting not wanting to add more realms until Stalag is at a high population...  Why is it the communities responsibility all of a sudden?
---
This is from name reservations too, not overall player base. Do they really think that many people are going to quit before p2?
---
I'm going to predict blizzard won't get rid of layering p2 because the limited servers at release will cause people to not want to roll on any new servers creating a bottleneck for the few first realms.
---
So future note when this happens: gj people defending layering, hope you're happy with what you got.
---
I'd say it was dungeon finder plus making the instances too easy.  That combination meant there was no reason to ever try to keep track of good players.  When I leveled in Vanilla I would always add the good players so I group later, but in retail I don't know if anyone does that.
---
2h arms is the best leveling spec
---
2h fury is no longer as viable because you can't proc enrage by sitting.
---
The best way to level is by by being way over leveled for the content you're doing. The mobs you're killing should be at least 2 levels lower than you, and the quests you're doing should be green. Doing this is the easiest way to level a warrior.
---
All you have to do is make sure you do zones for other races as well. Say you're a Human, first you do elwynn forest, but at level 10 you don't go to westfall, you go to Dun morough. You do a bunch of lower level dwarf quests there, then you go to Loch Modan and do the first early quests. Then you go to westfall and do the quests you now outlevel, up till going to Redridge to do the very early quests. Then you go back to lock Modan and finish it up except for the elite quests. Then back to westfall, finish it up, run deadmines and complete all the quests, hopefully get Smites Mighty Hammer. Then back to Redridge, polish that off. Now you're ready to start Duskwood and Wetlands at about level 25.
---
most of those described on the podcast are not aussie. not sure any were.
---
God watching Brack be so smug and condescending in the first part of this is painful.
---
Oh nice!
---
Hah I killed this guy in STV a bunch of times in beta and everyone got super mad at me
---
How dare they!?! Obviously, my likes are the best and everyone must share them with me. Now shut up and read the Wheel of Time.
---
You'll be fine mechanic wise, you would learn it. The only thing you should be worried about by not ever playing heals is that if you actually enjoy healing. I can't heal, I don't enjoy it one bit. Hopefully you aren't the same.
---
Herod: Full
---
Faerlina: Full
---
Thalnos: BR (and even then High, which according to Blizzard is several times the number of people who can exist on a single server)

Tell me again what all our fucking options were for east coast pvp?
---
You choose your own fun in an mmo
---
Unfortunately to many people vote based on a title before content.  Ignorance is bliss as the old saying goes.  I just hope it saves some groups of any the incoming queue shock.
---
It's based on wild estimations like 4 hours of average gametime and random queue numbers that we don't know how will turn out, it's all speculation. We don't know how it will look on day 2, we don't know how many is skipping day 1, we don't have a fucking clue. The only diference is that you pretend that you do.
---
That warglaive tho
---
No I think they're lying
---
Predominately P-Server players... it’s not a bad thing. Just an observation.
---
I'm alright with them being the winners as long as I'm also a winner. If I get a good community while getting to play Classic World of Warcraft then I consider it a win for myself. A deal where both parties involved get what they want is good business regardless of who makes the most money.
---
You didn't even need a complicated named to have everyone fuck it up in vanilla. If it wasn't a normal word, people fucked it up. Always.
---
I was kind of hoping to play ally this round, because i always used to play horde in the past so that would kind of breathe some new life into things, instead of going through the same old dance the same way. As it's her first time though, I thought it would be fun to let her take a little initiative and choose for us.
---
tbh, I'm just not sure *where* to look for guilds recruiting for only classic. I tried to make some posts in here, but they got removed by automod for being reposts because of random phrases I used. I'm just not really sure the exact right spot to look, even though I know for a fact there has to be a place for that pretty active right this instant lol.
---
Thanks for the kind words and best of luck on your adventures as well!
---
It's easier to pick up than you think and also more engaging than people assume as well. You'll have no trouble just grab a wand for leveling.
---
This suggestion really needs better visibility - it seems like a perfect and simple solution.
---
There's probably a way to reverse the clones as well (ie, removed before launch if the originals still exist on Herod).
---
Sorry, somehow forgot to mention we are Horde!

I do not care about your personal experiences.... but thank you for sharing.
---
If you do not see how pathetic and childish your last comment is, then you are destined to consume low grade media designed for the bottom masses for the rest of your days.
---
You literally designed a fabricated counter argument that defies all logic and encourages simplistic thinking..... all because you enjoy being average?
---
It is not based on people logging off, so no
---
But wait...I thought reddit and the WoW forums were saying new servers and 100% guaranteed to be dead. Ughhh my brain
---
There will be a couple more servers announced the day before launch that new people can roll on. I’m pretty sure of that.
---
Downvoted for being a flamer
---
Amazing! And very life like!
---
Jus highlighted the hypocrisy in ppl spending hundreds of dollars on the game previously and all of a sudden 8 bucks is “a little too much”
---
Seriously if you had to contemplate spending 8$ then you definitely shouldn’t play a game with a sub model. Spend your time getting a better paying job or take courses about how to save more effectively. Of course it was a cash grab...it’s blizzard. At least it allowed them to gauge interest and low and behold they are rolling out a few new servers to meet demands. BUT MY EIGHT DOLLARS BRO.  Jesus a burrito from chipotle costs more.

Guy is prob in UK, friends prob take a 4hr train to get to him... it's like saying friend visiting from a different state to hangout when they live in Indiana and I live in Chicago

3. An easy to use addon is CTmod. I used it for the stress test. Can upload a picture if you want. Saved a screenshot of my CTmod UI as I was setting up. 
---
  It has many other features which are useful as well. Can tweak target frames and stuff among other things. 
---
Eventually I will switch to luna unitframes and either bartender, dominos or zbar( doubt it will be updated but was the best bar addon, could make unlimited number of bars). At launch though I want as little hassle as possible so CTmod it will be for a while.
---
I don't attack druids. Life's hard enough for us.
---
Yea, I think a few more shades of red and purple might just make this stand out just enough.
---
Pagle is where Marcus aka epicnamebro of dark souls lore fame is rolling.

you're playing a video game, get a grip please.

---
I believe that is a limitation of how many could be logged into the server at the same time. The "full" status would refer to the total amount of characters or accounts on that server.
---
Yeah I used speedhacks for a few months before being banned. Even teled to gm island like a month before the ban.
---
[Follows instructions good](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=rampantly)
---
So sensible. Instead Blizzard will open a single new pvp server in the middle of a workday next week and whine when players aren't able to coordinate a move with their dozens of friends.
---
Alright thanks the only warning my friend told me is the ammo/arrows are super annoying to get/manage how true is that?
---
Tbf if the only reason your guild isn't moving is because of names, that's a pretty stupid reason. Maybe I just don't care about names.

If you don't think Herod is going to be a shithole cesspool of toxicity then you are new to the internet

"Suit" also needs to rhyme with "me" somehow

When I eventually get to leveling my druid, I will give my tree friends a hug unless they are carrying the flag.
---
Yeah it needs to run circles around IF
---
you cant respec whenever you want to in PoE
---
You can only do a full reset once a season. other than that you need currency which is not cheap and hard to come by.
---
I'm not on the server but I wish Blizzard would give a time frame instead of just telling people that there will be a queue. Your math and deduction might be right. I doubt blizzard would be worried about queues that are low and I'm assuming the queue will be at least over a hour. Blizzard is probably taking release day into consideration, too. Now, I'm not worried about waiting in queues but blizzard should still let people know estimates as everyone is not the same.
---
I know what I want out of Classic and I'll wait in queues, how ever long, to play.
---
Horde player.  I don't kill greys unless they attack or try to screw me somehow or are camping one of ours.  Don't mess with people inside the druid zone.  Don't kill someone open world more than 3 times in a row unless it's a good back and forth fight where I'm taking as well as giving...unless it's someone who has corpse camped me or something.  I don't always attack if they are pulling/grinding etc....sometimes I will for sure, but often feel like it's just as fun to save the odd alliance from a bad pull or grind next to them until one of us can't resist hitting the other while they are low hps etc...makes the grind more suspenseful and keeps me interested when I'm bored.
---
ah... why are you posting your mom's pic on the internet??
---
To some extent, the problem may eventually work itself out due to people realizing that spending hours upon hours in queues simply isn't viable or reasonable. There's really only one logical choice when the game hard locks you out. However, many people are willing to suffer just to be part of the "alpha" server.
---
Blizzard definitely needs to open another PvP-EST server and allow transfers from Herod, and it should give advance notice to give people before releasing the server. Stalagg's abrupt release (and questionable name) was poorly conceived and didn't do anyone any favors, and I say this as someone who's going to be playing on Stalagg.
---
I was thinking Emily's pear as in, Emily's pear booty.
---
Blizzard is informing players of the status of the server. It’s not going to matter to them one way or the other. Players are the reason it’s so packed, not Blizzard.
---
He's saying theoretically they could  expand the active player cap. This would create many more layers. When they remove layering in Phase 2, they would have to reduce the active player cap so the server WON'T BE CRAZY and filled with characters. This would cause insane que times./ So he says THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT.
---
He says they are going to keep the active player cap THE SAME. So when they remove layers, you will see more players in the open world, but it will not affect your que time adversely since layering has nothing to do with que times. ONLY ACTIVIE PLAYER CAP affects que time WHICH IS UNCHANGED. WHAT DON'T YOU GET?

This is just par for the course

good thing they didnt accidentally get the Sword of a Thousand Truths instead

I mean I was going to play Shadow anyway, I just thought going healer, at least for the beginning would be a easier way to get groups and gear up.

I went with an enhancement tauren shaman. I really liked how Thrall was this very warrior-esque shaman and now that I have a chance to wield 2h weapons I feel like it'd be really fun to try out a fighting style like his. Reason I chose a tauren shaman was because I just like the general feel of tauren just as much as I enjoy the Orcs. It was kind of an even split on which I liked more. Also shamans are just cool
---
I never knew how cathartic it would be to see all those cinematics played in reverse (it started to feel more warm and fuzzy around TBC)
---
I don't give a single fucking shit about Blizzard. If their headquater burns down tomorrow, I couldn't give less of a shit. Nevertheless, it'd have been a WAAAAAAAAAAY bigger fuck up if they released to many realms than to few as that would give classic haters the ammunition to say "lul dead game". 
---
You blindly hating blizzard isn't any better than the fanboys blindly licking their ass.
---
What is the name of that song? Holy shit if that didn't hype me uppp.
---
They are idiots man and lack common sense. If these servers are full or almost full already, and only a fraction of the player base has created characters, doesn't it make sense that Stalagg and the other servers will fill as well? It's incredibly simple to comprehend, but I'm not surprised this sub is on for yet again, a non-problem.
---
This post is 10000% the quality of latest post. Actual information rather than the ‘what should I pick’ screenshots or other BS.
---
While I am not playing the American servers and do not care about its status personally, it will be clear this server is going to have severe login queues at least in the beginning. I think it would be for everyone’s best interest to move if able unless you do not mind the extreme queues. Remember that using macros or other software to stay logged in forever is a punishable offense.
---
Good post, have like.
---
This is pretty phenomenal.  Thanks for posting your find!
---
"And you think you do but REEEEEEE"?
---
Well, as you are leveling you can definitely still heal with shadow being your main spec. Late game if you are focused on PvE you'll probably have an easier time healing but you can always do shadow just may have a more difficult time getting some groups. If you like PvP, you can do very well as a healer or in shadow. I actually think shadow is very fun in PvE as well but more so in the open world solo than anything.
---
that could be referring to the realm size in p1... we dont know that its for p2
---
It's still Blizzards fault for releasing only one server for Germany for example. All the large guilds like mine already secured their names on this server right when it opened. The reason why this server will now have 10h ques is because people who will start later will probably want to play with their friends who already were forced to create their characters on this server.
---
It's Blizzards fault for not anticipating enough people. They can not expect guilds with hundreds of people to organize a server change now that they already got a name.
---
All the Blizzard apologists claimed that Blizzard knows better than the community. Blizzard never new better than the community.
---
Preach partakes of the drama, towelliee doesn't. he may comment on it, but he usually stays away and just raids. the man almost never pvp's which is where a lot of toxicity of these communities is bred and fostered
---
Best part of the game!  Love escalating hostilities until the whole zone is just a riot.  Not a lot of lvling going on, but so much fun.
---
blizzard is literally planning everyone around it... they better know it
---
&gt;Also, computers can not create "random". 
---
*glances at RDRAND opcode*
---
Word. Exactly how I’m feeling
---
Stress test worked without any lag in like 100+ player fights :)
---
The timer duration was increased before 1.12, so it won’t be an issue in Classic.
---
But .... but ... that vanilla experience!  j/k
---
Still my fav zelda game!
---
That’s how they busted open the market. They made a part of the game for hardcore players, but simultaneously made it fun for casuals.
---
The main variable to this that nobody can account for is influx to servers at release.  If every server is full, and Herod appears to be a leading server, then new players will join there as well, further prolonging the problem.  It's lose/lose in this situation.  I don't know how I would handle this as Blizzard without any defined projection of subscribers.  It's a hard business choice.
---
Alëx reporting in!
---
What does that matter? Herod will already be full, everyone will fill up Stalagg. I'm POSITIVE of that. Any new players already see the doom and gloom of Herod.
---
 You can do a remind me on this, and I can guarantee u it. Bottom line -- if you want a lower pop server, you have to wait til launch for new ones. Stalagg will be *packed*.
---

---
I'm seeing some issues with the glancing blow formulae.
---
It falls apart when mob defense and weapon skill are even, and when weapon skill is higher than mob defense.
---
For example, level 60 attacker with 304 weapon skill vs. level 62 mob (which has 62 * 5 = 310 defense):
---
    High: abs(1-(1.2-0.03*(310-304))) = 2% damage penalty
---
    Low: abs(1-(1.3-0.05*(310-304))) = 0% damage penalty
---
    Avg: 1% damage penalty
---
Whereas according to the chart it should be between 5% and 15%, closer to 5%.
---
Any ideas or clarifications on these?
---
Healing is definitely something that became more fun later in WoW PvE. For PvP though as a priest is can be very fun but it's mostly because people aren't as predictable as the NPCs.
---
Cool, so people who weren't prepared to pay just to reserve names are going to be locked out from playing with their guild. Because good luck trying to get the entire guild to move.
---
That would put me off before it even launches. They would be insane to do that.
---
I accelerate and brake with my feet... what do you use?
---
I might have to give it a playthrough while waiting for classic
---
Hunter can for gold easier? Makes gearing an alt easier?
---
Blizzard is doing nothing. They could've just setup a private server and it would've been a better experience than this. It's just a cash grab and they have no idea what they are doing.
---
I’ve had the same two names for almost 10 years and never had an issue in any game I’ve ever played including wow
---
sorry you're getting downvoted but you're absolutely right
---
"wait, you guys ACTUALLY wanted this!?" is very telling to their state of mind
---
give me a game where accomplishments matter and and they can be displayed for all to see. yes it's vanity but what the hell else are people here for, the GAMEPLAY? rudimentary at best. it was never the 300 hours grinding a mob spawn just to get the damn purple BoE hammer. it's walking around with the hammer no one else was going to take their 300 hours to grind and match you
---
vanilla wasn't a perfect game by far, but it was really good at getting lots of people together to do trivial meaningless shit that takes a lot of time and effort. people made friends and THAT was where the fun of the game was
---
The RNG is how you casualize a loot shooter, you have to abstract the lesson and apply it to WoW.
---
Good luck trying to get your entire guild to move for you.
---
Heart stuff is weird. Especially if it's a valve they may tell him to keep physical exertion to a minimum.
---
Yeah I’m logged in several hours before it comes live spamming that auto clicker while watching movies or something. If they make it work that way of course.
---
The vast majority of names has likely not even been taken yet... Unless you plan on naming yourself something uncreative that every 11 YO wants to name himself.
---
It will work itself out some for sure.  But then comes phase 2.  Even if they have gotten just to the point of no queue, then they just add a queue again when layers drop.  They even mention it in the blue post.  It's a tough spot for players and Blizzard.
---
And a time-traveling dragon named Chromie
---
Done.
---
Is simple math, between French and German speakers there's around 160 million people on EU, and there's around 500 million on the rest of the countries. You are gonna need at least double the servers in English than French + German. But they don't seem to understand and now I fear is too late. They gonna have 2 overpopulated servers with tight communities and on the rest are gonna be the lone wolfs and the tourists
---
It is, but you won't be healing for a little while. You will be healing for the entire time you play with a guild until all of your DPS is geared, and THEN you get a shot at the gear for shadow. Not trying to push you away, just being realistic. You gotta like healing if you go priest, or just go strictly shadow and try to find a guild.
---
Gunna level queue free on Stalagg and then transfer to Herod after I’m 60 and sit in queues the whole time instead of playing while laughing like Tom Cruise with a headset on.
---
I didn't see anyone here assume that here either, wym?
---
As long as you only hunt runners and not HuntingRunners everything is fine :)
---
Owh man, I'm drinking coffee. Nobody should get a feelz lump in their throat while drinking coffee. Glugulp.
---
I loved the reversed Cataclysm footage, something very satifying seeing thousand needles being unflodded.
---
Thanks for confirming my first impression of you.
---
I would agree with you if there were any warning before blizz opened the new server, but they didn't. Forcing a group of (10 here) friends who all waited patiently and logged in at exactly the right time on name day to all get their names (though some got more lucky than others with login times) to all be stuck with some random crap names kind of defeats half the purpose of reserving the names in the first place. All of us are okay taking 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th choice of names, but by the time we found out they were even opening Stalagg it was too late even for that. (It's not even like we choose catchy or common words)
---
We were warned, but very belatedly.
---
I knew I was rolling an English pve realm. So I had the Choice between pyrewood village and mirage raceway. Pyrewood sounded more alliance since it’s a gilnean settlement. Mirage more horde since it’s a thousand needles thing(I think). So since I wanted to roll alliance, I just chose pyrewood. I also found an alliance pyrewood discord with over 800 members already, so it seemed like a good decision to me personally.
---
\*cries in tauren\*
---
Using an auto hotkey macro to stay logged in is a punishable offense and is frankly a sh\*thead move. I **will** report any player I catch that uses such tactics.
---
I’m cool with full man, my post isn’t about that, the writing is on the wall Herod is probably the most crowded any server has ever been ever and a simply full server is nowhere near as packed as Herod already.
---
Even if stalagg hits the full mark it’s gonna have roughly 50K less people on it than Herod
---
I’ve learned to use them for my own entertainment.
---
Better keep the best class for last day

Respectfully, I disagree to this interpretation of the post.  I just posted an article that analyzed the que times for Herod using cold math and the blizzard post.  Feel free to look into it as well friend.  May your time in game be everything you want it to be.
---
My rogue got them in back to back runs. &gt;.&gt;
---
He got the contest winners tabard of frostwolf too
---
Mostly they leveraged their already very popular IP and made it run on some of the worst hardware ever so anyone could play.
---
Same reason we kill babies in real life.  ;D
---
&gt;We are all older and don't have time to deal with hours and hours of queues.
---
Yet you have people whining about NAMES, so which is it, are you all older or do you care about something as stupid and childish as a name lol?
---
Going to try and take my time and enjoy the leveling process (read quests, engage in pointless world PvP, etc.).  Never succeeded in doing this, but read the WoW chronicles series while waiting for launch and it’s given me a whole new respect for the lore and story line of the game.
---
Any chance we could get some numbers for an Arms Warrior spec?
---
I have Papa on Faerlina... looking to trade for something cool on herod
---
&gt; "You think you want Vanilla WoW, but you don't."
---
&gt; I just smile now with these server populations
---
That doesn't make any sense. We are still in the 'think you want it phase'.
---
To see who was actually right, you have to look at the population in 6 months. Were they totally wrong and everybody wants it? Is it a relatively small core of players who want it? Or does nobody actually want it?  Only time can answer that.
---
I still don't understand your interpretation
---
Weirdness on classic beta had eye of shadow drop from a demon that was kited to Everlook in winterspring.  Eye of shadow and divinity should be p2 as well, so it seems some of the phase2 stuff might incorrectly drop in p1.
---
&gt;they don't represent the rest of the server and the greater population,  and to assume so is just ignorant. 
---
Soap box is real
---
Why wouldn't it be directly proportional to the rate of people logging off? That would make no sense.  The goal is to control the amount of active connections
---
How do you claim to have this knowledge of what's going to happen? 
---
This isn't a new game. A new game in which people don't know what to expect, and don't know if they will like it.
---
This is a game in which most people know *exactly* what they're getting into. Sure, there will be some who are "tourists", or whatever you want to call them. But this is hardly a typical game launch. **This is people coming back for dessert, for a flavor they've had before, and they know they like it.**
---
It took her 14 days to ding 60? Filthy casual.
---
You jest but Minecraft with mods + shaders is insanely demanding.
---
You don't have to roll on a east coast server! The ping won't be an issue and there are enough people from east and west on these servers that raid times will be all over the place and you'll find more than enough guilds to suit your needs.
---
A healthy server back in vanilla had good player retention because it was basically the only MMO in town, and people loved MMO's. It's not the same today.
---
What track is it? I need it in my life
---
Ok bud, good luck with that

releasing the name dom on Stalagg if anyone wants it

[This is the document my gm made to describe our loot distribution system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mgak-G34CcwiVYI_Q6xi5qgysUPJBLQNbg5NAmp7M-s/edit). We are using ep/gp with loot council for some things. but the doc describes ep/gp pretty well.
---
true
---
The effort you put in for the stones
---
Speculative math is still speculation. Just because it's a good fermi estimation doesn't mean it's not an estimation.
---
They haven’t.
---
Not every guild plays like that. There are semi casual guilds that will allow suboptimal specs.
---
Besides which, one shadow priest is totally normal to bring to raids
---
releasing the name Dom on Stalagg if anyone wants it
---
I wish I had friends that didn't think WoW/WoW classic is gay 🙃
---
&gt; We simply need more servers.

You don't necessarily know that.

Sorry, calling everyone you disagree with *toxic* is really fucking old already.

If you’ve never played any mmo before then this is really going to be a treat!  Well it will either way, but if you have played a different mmo recently then I’ll just say... make sure to keep in mind this is going to feel much slower... in a good way!
---
My brother's name is Sean and this is hilarious to me.
---
Its nice. It means you know...they listened to their community. People are demonizing the heck out of this guy. They're giving us classic, lets move past his views on it in the past. He seems to be embracing it now. Which I respect.
---
Unless it’s a bald orc on a goblin trike that name is stupid
---
nope i think they announced it on the main wow page, as long as you have an active subscription, you’ll be able to play classic
---
You have to consider the reality of MC and BWL - the challenge isn't the content, it's getting 40 people to show up.
---
Did they at least stop letting people make characters?
---
Instead of a bloodbath, it will be a gankfest when you're going through then. At least I'll have a chance.
---
Find a dungeon grinding group. Mine has zero intention of leveling outside of dungeons from 17 all the way to 40 (with the exception of any prereq quests). We've planned our breaks, sleeps, and meals to all line up. We even know who is going to go get each sharable quest so we don't waste any extra time.
---
You can never stop normies.
---
Been here since actual Vanilla actually, but sure keep telling yourself that. Also, if that's your entire point then this clarification is still nothing more than another "pinky promise" so what does it matter?
---
Fail by not having the old human model as the Classic girl.
---
Maths based on speculation and estimation is still speculation and estimation lol...
---
Dwarf killing bunnies, perfect.
---
YOU THINK YOU DO....
---
I’m trying to think if there’s even a truly viable alternative to stv. I’m sure there is but the game tends to funnel both factions there for the level 30-40 range at one point or another. 
---
For horde I vaguely feel like you can skip it and do thousand needles to shimmering flats to tanaris. Idk what alliance alternative is. 
---
There’s always spam running scarlet monastery for 6-8 levels 🤷🏼‍♂️.
---
People use cats because of their damage. I just stack the natural armor skill on my cat. It ends up getting around a 45% physical damage reduction at mid to higher levels. It’s plenty tanky. And the massive boost of DPS it has over bears (Cat +10%, bear -10%) is considerable. More damage also means more threat, so better at holding onto aggro, and faster kill times so comparable damage received to the higher armor/HP pets.
---
If you want a faster atk speed and tanky pet, there is a level 11 rare Scorpid in durotar (deathflayer I think) that is the only high armor pet in the game with an atk speed of less than 2.0, it has 1.6.

Conversely: *imagine being so dumb that you’d give a multi-million dollar corporation 7 bucks for literally nothing in return and think you’re smart for doing it*.
---
Different strokes.
---
No one said you're an asshole! Just don't complain! Adapt and change with the tools and information you have. 
---
We're all excited to play and have an ideal way this will all turn out, but we/us/me/you are ultimately responsible for choosing the server we play on, with no one to blame but ourselves when it does not work out!
---
How can you wait longer than literally a a month after lol?
---
There will be a large spanish community on one of the EU servers, if you want to practice the language just go where they go and you can play with them there.
---
Why give a notice and not just launch the server right away? While I'm sure its not as simple as pressing a button, there's really nothing stopping them from announcing a new realm and simultaneously launching it right away.
---
&gt;medium right now will have more players on them then full servers in vanilla did
---
Yeah it's good to have confirmation on that. Im on fairbanks which was "low" and I assumed low meant "only" 2-3 layers
---
Then get dced and have to queue anyway.
---
Easier solution is to wait a couple hours before trying to play.
---
GROB MOB!!
---
Oh fuck that hurts.
---
I'm just worried about the faction imbalance on pvp servers.
---
even if they dont own the base game or any of the expansions?
---
Hillsbrad has a few quests, one for a yeti cloak, some for the nagas and I believe some to go into the Alterac Mountains and do a few hits. Arathi should also have some stuff, and SM is just up the road if you can convince people to make the run.
---
Holy fuck it is you
---
Holyshit.
---
^(grobmob)
---
Here's the thing, 1st yes they messed up by not having enough servers.  2nd they did add another server for both regions.  3rd No one is instested in any server yet outside of name reserves.
---
Anyone trying to make it seem like there is more at stake than a name right now is a cry baby.
---
The thing about armory is that it introduced the tools needed that lead to add-ons such as gearscore and raider.io. As much as I do like your idea and the convenience of the armory in general, it's something I'll gladly give up to avoid going into that rabid hole. The current state of retail pugging is a direct result over such add-ons.

---
I'll send you a PM about borders since we're getting close to rule 5.
---
yes, they should delete a server. is this a joke?
---
Stalagg is an awful name.
---
Yes. Full doesn't prevent new character creation it's just information you can use to choose a realm.

I remember being excited to see my older brother. He was home from his first semester of college on fall break and we hadn’t talked in a while. I wanted to catch up and hear what college was like so I walked in his room and sat at the edge of his bed. He was sitting at his desk back turned to me, motioning his head upward slightly to acknowledge I had entered the room. I began asking him questions, but seemingly couldn’t steal his attention off his computer screen for man than a few moments.  His answers got shorter and shorter so I took the bait and just sat there quietly watching play a game I had never seen before. What was 10 minutes became 30, then an hour, and finally my brother asked if I wanted to play. He needed to take a piss. 
---
We were gamers born in the 80’s. Nintendo, Sega, Gameboy, N64, Playstation,XBOX, Pogs Pokémon, Yugioh, Magic. You name it we had it. We watched it. We vegged it. Yet, how did I miss this and what the hell was I playing? At this point in my life I had never experienced drugs, but in the hour of watching and the minute and a half it took my brother to come back from the restroom I became hooked. Like smack to a hillbilly I had to have more. Unfortunately that was my brothers only break that night and I’d have to wait for the morning before I could venture out to the nearest game store to get myself a copy. 
---
I awoke and made sure to grab my brother before he could log on for the rest of the day. We ventured out on our first quest together, hitting them all. The stop sign trade in your memories for nothing store, the don’t want to grow up giraffe store, the red bullseye dog, the barely pay your workers wal-fart. Nothing..not a single copy anywhere. My excitement turned to anxiety and ultimately to a waiting game. 
---
It would end up being weeks before could I get my fix. A fix that I didn’t yet understand would impact my life for years to come. A high from video game that I didn’t yet know existed . A high generated by a community that I never anticipated being part of, but oft look back on in longing to experience again. 
---
What was once thought impossible is now 9 days away. I get chills. I tear up. I sit with anticipation once again. I’m ready. To once fight side by side with my brother, to venture into the memories of our past, to make new friends, and to relive the moments that changed my life forever. I’ll see you in you Azeroth.
---
- Tickle
---
I’m glad they’re being more transparent, but this is badbad. Plenty of people have no care to save their name but will play, plenty of people haven’t even subscribed yet but will still play. 
---
Release a few more, if they are all full or high at release that is going to be a HUGGEE problem. 
---
At this stage it looks like layering is in for a looonnnngggggggggggg time, not a few weeks like I - and many others -had hoped.
---
But I still dont know where Mankrik's wife is now.
---
From what I've heard, the shazzrah discord is absolutely toxic.  I see the OP will fit in beautifully.
---
If I may, using the averages I posted above was not based on speculation.  It was based on poll data new and old from WoW for average playtime of live, and then based on samples of posts in Reddit for name reservation queue.  While the numbers are still estimations, they are anything but uneducated estimations.
---
How could they warn you a server is overpopulated before it even opened up?
---
I remember checking the leaderboards before school and seeing that I got rank 10, I couldn't wait to leave school half way through and skip class to go to my friends house and play WoW!
---
You need to post this as a new thread and try to get some traction. This idea is way better than what Blizzard is currently doing.
---
I can't wait to make both friends and enemies on a server/game where the same red player that kills you at lvl 20 can be lvling with you all the way to 60, met in world pvp, and then also met in the BG grind.
---
I think you're talking to the wrong player base on this one buddy, your characters name is the most important part of character creation, it's the thing that sets you apart the most, are you saying we should all just get generic no name, non custom characters?
---
I mean i came here hoping to hear it wouldnt be 15/mo, so its not that ridiculous a thing to ask about
---
I know that, but we didn't really know their metric for "medium" or "low" and if that had changed. Saying medium is more than their highest pop servers of vanilla adds more context to it.
---
I don't quite feel TBC is where the downhill slide started.  Things like flying mounts, heroic dungeons and daily quests, in my opinion, expanded the experience.  Arena formalized PVP and made it competitive with ranking (for those who need to measure their e-peen, which isn't necessarily wrong).  The downward slide really started in WotLK and was ramped up to 11 in Cataclysm.  At least in TBC you still had to farm reputation to get into the heroics and you had to travel to the dungeon entrance.  So what if you could fly over everything?  It was a quality of life improvement that wasn't cheap.  You had to EARN it and work for it.  I do see your point about not raising the level cap in order to preserve the viability of vanilla raid gear but if you do that then what's the point of doing TBC raids if the gear isn't going to be any better?  At the very least level cap should be raised but the quest rewards from Outland shouldn't immediately replace vanilla raid gear, only the TBC raid gear would do that.  THAT I always found to be a stupid aspect to the game (that gear you worked months for would be replaced after 10 minutes of effort digging through buffalo poop piles or something simple and silly).  All in all I see the points you're trying to make and I respect your passion for the game but I don't entirely agree with everything you listed.
---
This is dumb. If people want to play on a full server and deal with a longer queue then that’s their choice. Why would Blizz force anybody to leave a server?
---
Agreed, how out of touch do you have to be to believe that players don't want to form groups themselves? We remember the world that used to be in world of warcraft, back when it felt like an MMORPG and not just a hollow shell of an excuse for teleporting to instanced content.
---
If you remove all inconvenience from a game you remove the soul from it, it's no different to playing a game and enabling cheats, sure you could still have a semi-playable experience, but it's going to be much worse once the novelty wears off and there's no challenge or immersion anymore. The "you think you do but you don't" quote applies far more to the features blizzard thought we wanted in WoW over the years than anyone else. They thought we wanted all these conveniences and gutted the game in the process. 
---
I hope they've learnt from the mistake their game direction took after cataclysm and retail improves off the success of classic.
---
can I mob your grob though?
---
Stuff like that is inevitable, almost never can you get away with having it in today’s gaming age. If that’s what keeps the servers running then let them in my honest not so popular opinion
---
Massive blackrock guild wars because everyone is waiting for a few guildies to login before MC starts and a lot of guilds have the same raid times.  Blood, lava, and hilarity ensue.  Back then fuck world buffs you were going to die on the ramps, chains, or in lava  30mins before start.
---
This guy literally just downloaded 2 videos off of youtube and put it in 1 video and is taking credit for it. SMH, make some original content.
---
I'm Sagax, I played with Maicho, Oorik, Droodude and Bloodydavid. I remember when the event came out and you were decked out in the welfare epics destroying all of us. Good shit man.
---
Ok, Ive reserved my name on herod, grobulus and that new server. I'm ready.
---
Its a logical fallacy when its not people. Its not a fallacy is the decision maker believes its true.
---
Go look on OSRS reddit. You will see so many posts of 'well we already changed X, gotta change Y now for consistency' or 'we already showed we don't care about X, so might as well change Y'
---
In an academic context, you can't use slippery slope. But in a real life decision making context, you absolutely can because the other party will often use it as a justification
---
Yes, but definitely Cataclysm too.
---
Wait people think STVietnam is a bad thing?  That zone was a beautiful clusterfuck of pvp.
---
This is a really good question. I imagine the cache of the firelord is in but who knows
---
Your argument for opening more servers is that nobody likes creepy uncle? Yeah they're not opening more until the ones they have fill up
---
&gt;If I may, using the averages I posted above was not based on speculation.  It was based on poll data new and old from WoW for average playtime of live, and then based on samples of posts in Reddit for name reservation queue.  While the numbers are still estimations, they are anything but uneducated estimations.
---
Just posted this above you in the thread as you replied to this.  Maybe I should outline where I got these numbers from.
---
1. Herod was never the 'only' choice.
---
2 do you seriously not expect all these realms to become full rapidly on launch night anyway?
---
Need a new link for the alternate thalnos discord, please.
---
Depends on the server mine it seems to be the second lowest after druid. thank god. I'm a bit of a hipster but also nostalgic for my shaman.
---
Hey buy a guy some flowers or something first there bucko
---
I have Varok reserved on Grob. Willing to trade for Unbreakable, Thrall, or something else interesting.
---
There used to be so much guild drama in Vanilla around ninjas, corrupt GMs, and people getting the loot they wanted and instantly /gquitting for another guild. 
---
Was part of the excitement :)
---
Shaman is my favorite class. But I hate the horde so I went with my second favorite class. If I could be an alliance shaman in classic I totally would.
---
Only really happened in Hillsbrad vs TM, AQ gate opening, and maybe Naxx pre event but I can't remember.
---
I'm browsing /r/wow daily. And I've been browsing /r/leagueoflegends for years. I know what I'm talking about, sorry. It's just day and night if you compare how much constructive discussion is going on overall. Not to mention, complaining about content getting delayed speaks volumes about the state of the game. But we're not having that discussion, are we? No. We want more content. That's going to fix everything!
---
A third server would be a great final solution 👍🏼
---
enchanting so you can DE all the sick BOP loot you aoe farm in dungeons.  Tailoring so you can craft sick gear to do said aoe farm in dungeons.
---
News flash, layering ends before phase 2. What are those people gonna do then?
---
Been following Cauthon for a while. His girlfriend Artemis won the TipsOut first to 15 competition. They're both great people and very talented.
---
All these people on Herod server telling people to move off of Herod but unwilling to do it themselves... seems odd.
---
You guys are always in packs of 3 lol hate it
---
That must have been incredibly exciting! What Rank did you get for that?
---
These meeting stones reminded me of a wonderful wow video called [yesterday’s news](https://youtube.com/watch?v=sJESm-assss)
---
You shouldn't join that guild because the realm is full. Either your guild should move, or you should find a new guild. People that subbed early, or were subbed to retail reserved spots on that realm. You chose not to. By stubbornly maintaining that you will play with only those people, you're exacerbating the problem. It's cut and dry tbh.
---
I played there!
---
or well, my guild moved there from Dunemaul back in the day.
---
Wow Classic is literally the World of Warcraft full game with everything after that being an expansion that essentially waters down the baseline experience. That makes the current game and classic two entirely different experiences in which one has you playing the role of champion and the other has you scraping the bottom of the barrel, and who doesn't like a good underdog story?
---
Wooooo I get to be a contrarian today. Speculation and making hypothesis based on poll data is definitely based in science. It's just also most definitely speculation.
---
RemindMe! 3 months
---
Stalagg if you are EST
---
They are going to cap the population on herod in p1. This is what they are telling you now. We aren't going to open more layers on herod, because then at p2 you'll have 10k+ queues.
---
Instead of just uncaping the layer limit off the bat and saying 2nd week we are opening a new server and will allow pre transfer to it from herod. So guilds and friends have time to plan to move. Instead of doing this they are just like take a chance sure you lost your name because we told no one about the worse server name ever, Stalagg, and no one may even play there because at release we didn't have enough servers and now people want to avoid the low pop server, as its worse to have no queue and no group than to wait in a queue for a group.
---
Also look at this guys comment (wherever it was):
---
&gt;Blizzard can do whatever they want with their servers.
---
Rofl, yeah and we call call them shit for it and stop playing as far more will simply stop playing classic because they already messed this up this badly.
---
Give in...
---
Im with you, but I also understand some people have literally been known by the same name for **YEARS**, and from what I understand, your name and the reputation behind it means a lot more in classic because of things like group finder not being present.
---
Play PVE.

Venture Co was last... I was there Gandalf, I was there 3000 years ago...
---
Not saying it's dead, but it's dead to me. I already have 3 names I want on Herod with 50+ friends, guildies, and co-workers on the same server. It took a lot of effort to coordinate, but we got it done. We can't just casually reroll.
---
Some people roll pvp servers then act surprised when they’re faced with pvp. :/
---
Seems like rp-pvp grobbulus will have a large population  of people with the same mind set you described. Maybe check out that sub Reddit.   And You don't have to rp
---
You're right. But it's still a strong indicator, for now.
---
seems quite stupid that they dont wanna open a 4th up, before people on shazzrah has moved over to the 3rd
---
whats the 4th gonna help then? just cause even more community split?
---
The guy has made a good guess, that's the bottom line.  How could anyone NOT think there's going to be six hour queues on Day One?
---
I spent 30 minutes searching google and famtasynamegenerator and came up with about 20 solid names that I could roll with. Take pets of names that you like, and mix them with other names, and boom you have a name that is totally unique and personal to you.
---
Me four!
---
should have used the low poly classic female imo
---
Dude did you read the same post as the rest of us?
---
&gt;Based on name reservations so far, the Shazzrah realm is looking to be massively overpopulated. If all existing players on this server remain there, login queues in excess of 10,000 players are a certainty, and possibly much higher than that.
---
Blizzard just came out and told us directly they're worried that some realms are going to be overpopulated. I'm not even sure why you're spending time and energy arguing about this when the company just told us the lay of the land.
---
Not to mention a significant amount of those German / French speakers will roll on English speaking servers to play with international friends regardless.
---
Stalagg will be just as full as Herod is now on launch day. How many times are you going to move servers before you come down off your high horse?
---
anyone else waiting for the bear to roar at the end!?! this was awesome.
---
He used the word mug, chances of being British or Indian are high
---
I get the desire for at least the sound of the name. Like if you really want "Teddy". 
---
You could be Teddy, Teddi, Tedi, Tedy, Teddii, Tedii, Tteddy, Tedie, Teddie, and on and on.
---
I’m trying to get my friends off Herod, I sent them the video, now we wait....
---
"I say let's stick it out" 
---
"Other people will leave after a few days"
---
:(
---
These were expensive right? These days anyone can just export a file of their figure and walk down to the library and print it out for less than a dollar. It'd be unpainted though, and you'd probably need some basic Blender skills to make it print-ready. But it's obscenely easy if you know what you're doing. I Dm'd some DnD at a camp and just printed any models I needed by ripping them straight out of WoW. Need a human mage? Just dress one up and export the file.
---
You're not taking into account layering. We don't know what the cap of a server is.
---
Keep in mind that Blizzard is basing the number of servers on how many players they project will be playing the game months and years down the road, not to cater to a nice launch experience. They don't want to end up with dead servers.
---
Panic adding a bunch of servers right now is about the worst thing they could do
---
That is awesome, will definitely get!
---
It's mostly just a meme aside from novelties like Moon Guard on retail. Hell, even on Moon Guard you wouldn't run into ERP'ers that often outside of Goldshire. I wouldn't worry about it. If anything, most of those types will most likely end up on the PvE RP server. Although I don't RP, my main server has been Emerald Dream (for the World PvP) since Cataclysm and I can count in 1 hand running into random people being lewd in public chat since then. 
---
At the end of the day, no matter what server you roll on, your kid is still 8 and on the Internet with live chat. Best thing to do is play together.
---
it's been that way for months, lol
---
Welp, good luck friends :(
---
Noob
---
&gt; You're not taking into account layering.
---
You're not taking into account layering isn't even going to last for the entirety of Phase 1.
---
Did you make this? If so, great job, thank you!
---
Its a tough call, one you'll have to make on your own. Ganking can and will happen on a PvP server. As another who started in vanilla yet will still level slow, this is a fact of life I dealt with back then and will have to deal with again now (RP-PvP server for me). You have to decide which you prefer: the safety of a PvE server yet the only possible cross faction danger is if you go to battlegrounds or wander into the main territory of the opposite faction, or the danger of a PvP server where you could be ganked yet that very fact also makes you more a part of your chosen faction?
---
Good luck with your choice!
---
Which is doubly better!
---
Im invested because i got like 4 different loosely tied groups and then all their friends etc all to pick a single server. 
---
Yeah people are invested. Could we get say 80% of the to switch sure... but still. And people WANT their vanilla name, that is a big thing for a lot of people.
---
Retail does like difficulty, look at the Mythic Raid fights now compared to older expansions. That shit can get really complicated very quickly. Same with Mage Tower, that was insanely popular. The thing is they probably have statistics that show something like when it gets easier it gets more popular and has more participation, therefore they don't like difficulty right? Even so, the ceiling being that high might make people feel the need or have the drive to grow if you get my drift.
---
Vanilla is more difficulty in Logistics then it is in Gameplay, and that may not be very enjoyable to many Retail players. The bosses are simple, but the prep is intense and the lack of loot means you have to have a solid system to keep all 39 other players from tearing apart over the drops.
---
I hope that if Retail lifts some things from Vanilla, it's to try to add back RPG into the game. Weird niche items, consumables, abilities, some even low level (though that concept doesn't exist in New zones) but can be effective in their circumstance. That sticky goo you found on a spider could save your ass in a gank or something. This sword has a debuff effect, this one Cleaves, and this one is just raw stats. Stuff like that. And if the new patch seems to at least be looking that way.
---
Remember when you downloaded that Questie app to give you the map markers that you said ruined the immersion and made the game too easy? 
---
Seriously though, most of the features that people say ruined WoW are features that, in some form, were add ons first. All these people talking about how hardcore they are when they’re going to be downloading everything they can to make it as much like retail as possible.
---
BGs won't be in the game until phase 3, like 6 months from launch.
---
Classic is slower paced and grouping with people is encouraged but not required.
---
You should get out of your comfort zone a bit and get to know people you meet.
---
The best way to level in PvP is with another person. People look for easy targets like solo players. Two people are more intimidating and you'll win fights much more often and be able to kick solo players off the mobs your after.
---
Or communicate with your son and answer questions he has about things people say. Might actually teach him something.
---
Honestly world pvp is not going to be like it was in the original vanilla time period.  A lower count streamer with just 500 followers can ruin you and your guilds day out farming.  So just do whatever you think is best and want to do.
---
Right. And Blizzard is expecting a large attrition rate. Not 100% of players are going to make it into Phase 2
---
Assuming they go with the way it's always been 'Locked' is a temporary status that goes on whenever the server has a queue. So yes at that point you can't create a character unless you already have one on that server even if you wait through the queue. But the 'Locked' status goes away back to 'Full' when there isn't a queue.
---
So yes if you wait until release night and expect to be able to create a character then you are going to have a problem even if you wait through the queue, but there should be no immediate rush (for example if you don't already have a sub like me) - it's not like 'Locked' is triggered by number of characters. I can't see there being an actual queue until release day, so as long as you sub and create a character before the launch you should be fine.
---
(tagging /u/nokinship - don't panic!)
---
Nope, there are a few suggestions that is one that would fix the issue is it not?
---
I always think about leveling an alt, but the mix of this and grinding while solo the whole time sounds terrible.
---
Because not all of them keep 20 (21) points in Holy...
---
Lua maybe?  A basic script that references the mana costs of the shapeshifts.
---
It would basically say if you're casting Z spell and (x-y) where X is your current mana and Y is the cost of Z, would return a value less than the mana cost of your shapeshift, then an error message is returned.
---
You'll need the help of someone who knows basic .lua
---
Why would you skip mind control!? That’s a big reason to roll priest! Makes lvling much more fun when you can throw people off a boat/zep.
---
We seem to be going around in circles. Layering initially but it has caps so they want people to spread around the servers and they'll remove layering once the population subsides. Am I missing something here?
---
so you are saying when he was a fresh 60 as well as when bwl was end game he was making just as much gdp as when he has cleared naxx? also you do realize that he is not spending all 7000 hours farming for gold right?
---
Here’s a thought, open more servers.
---
It existed in classic, but it didnt work properly so it was never used
---
Interesting. Who doesn’t love dragon aspect lore?
---
Also keen on knowing!
---
Our mt got them in back to back runs pretty crazy!
---
Seconded. Generally real rpers are into the lore/high fantasy, and overall just want everyone to have a good time. It's similar to going to a convention, no matter what you're into you can find a friend. Or not, because everyone else is a socially reclusive fandom drooling wierdo just like you. An 8 year old may actually really like an rp server where they can really be whatever they want and it doesnt matter.
---
I live in PA and joined WoW in 2007, two weeks before BC. In my personal experience I never had an issue with raid times. Every time I looked for a guild, I was on Feathermoon (RP)(PST), I never had an issue finding one that worked around my times, ending before midnight. You won't have to worry about finding a guild on PST server. I'm joining a PST server for classic and never second guessed it.
---
i was a gm of a guild on a pacific time server while i lived in the east coast, we raided at 10pm my time which is prime time 7pm theirs, it was awesome, also you get on early in the morning and can farm mats with little competition.
---
I'll be over here fishing on my Warlock at level 17 for some Deviate Fish on day 3. Don't mind me boys
---
He’s 8. He doesnt need to understand the sad reality of a furry crawling into a gnomes ass quite yet
---
Imagine writing all this just to sound like an idiot.
---
basically that. i want the lowest risk of ended up on a dead server.
---
I'd rather wait in que times being excited to play to avoid the risk of logging in to have nobody to play with
---
Thanks man
---
Fuck whoever responded from blizzard
---
Tanking Deadmines. No idea why that's such a fond memory, or why I enjoyed it so much back in the day, but damn. I can't wait to get back to it. Just a couple of weeks off now.
---
Strat and Scholo will also be great trips down memory lane when I get there, but it'll be some time before I hit 60.
---
Release isn't the problem, weeks later when people have left is.

PvP, I took 2 weeks off to get ahead of the pack asap.  The longer it takes to level, the worse it will be in terms of corpse camping from higher level players
---
I meant a lot of us have been waiting since long before the initial announcement. I personally have been waiting for blizzard to make classic servers since around wotlk.
---
I’d say if you don’t have a guild or friends that are competitive then just enjoy the game. you don’t have to be the best as long as you enjoy it! it’s a huge journey to max level and i’m sure you and your husband will enjoy it together :) cheers

🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 "You should break up" 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
---
Getting people to play on the same server isn't investment.  There is no investment being placed there because the server doesn't exist yet.  As for the name, it's just that.  A name.  I'm betting that the first name you tried for back then was already taken.  I say this because mine were lol.

The literal current head of Blizzard.
---
Hope it helps. I went back and forth for a while on what to do and while I don’t plan on raiding hardcore(more of a PvP man myself) I want to have the option and EST will just limit me too much
---
I just got a new laptop to game on the road, the binds held across devices
---
No joke I'm teared up after the 3rd time I watching it.
---
We're finally going home.
---
I could see doing it.  Never have tried a pve server, but have had some fun creeping around pickpocketing and garotting mobs.  And have played a handful of single player games as a stealth class.  I'll bet the pop is less tho.
---
I’m cool with staying on Herod and getting down in the chaos filled trenches. That’s what vanilla WoW is all about. Pain, suffering, and eventually accomplishment(s).
---
Except these are 2 different kinds of CC and was never meant to share DR. Which is why this was removed in BC. A disorient and an incapacitate should never share DR.
---
I mean just for an example contrary to your imagining.. I haven't subbed but will 100% be there on launch day.   
---
Played Vanilla through Cataclysm. Haven't been interested in WoW for literal years. But the hype is real. However I can't justify paying for over half a months unused playtime just to secure a name. A name which I am convinced will still be available a day or two before launch.   
---
Pretty sure the OP is right on this one. Numbers are going to absolutely explode.
---
But pvp should only be 1v1 same level while not fighting mobs and only against classes that don't counter each other!  /s
---
I’m also not rolling RP like you are. Been there and loved it but I can’t commit this time around haha but more power to you my friend
---
I second this. The community here seems to be most active for being lower population than other servers. Check out r/grobbulus

That would completely screw anybody who hasn't paid to reserve names but who's guild is on that server. That would lose them people before it even starts. Just let the queues themselves encourage people.
---
I took two.
---
Then why are you letting him on the internet to play a game you think he’s too young for?
---
&gt; when people have left is

Save my comment for then and we'll discuss it further
---
Damn, the first pc I played WoW on had 112mbs of ram, on a 80gb hdd. 
---
Ran it in windowed mode at like 1/3 the size of my screen so I could get 20 fps.

Human Paladin named [Sephrin] (https://i.imgur.com/XJYsMqg.jpg).
---
They often have pretty creative memes too, not the same old rehashed stuff you see all over social media.
---
Once you have a pet's loyalty up to max, which isn't that hard, it needs hardly any food, definitely sustainable from random mob kills
---
To make you even more confused there is no Fir, Seco, Thir, they are One Two and Three respectively so first is always first, Second is always second and third is third, better yet the they are only repeated as abbreviations for numbers 1st 2nd 3rd, and only ignored for 11th 12th and 13th, unlit you reach those 3 number beyond 100, with 111th and so on.  
---
Isn't English grand and easy to understand.
---
Lol I loved that paladin whose macro said "Blessing of America on _____"
---
(Freedom) 😂
---
Are you going alliance or horde?
---
Beautiful sir.
---
Organization of a guild is the players jobs, not Blizzards.
---
Vuhdo was by far my favorite healing addon but idk if they are gonna release a version for classic. Hopefully they'll do!
---
You doom posters are terribly boring
---
It was 7 months till first Chrommagus xbow for my hunter, and I wasn't class lead so make that 9 months...
---
blizzard is hated whichever direction they go in. They can't win it. 
---
too few servers (even with layering) and people complain about queue times or spawn rates.    
---
too many servers (even with less layering) and people complain it's too empty.
---
Must have been the whopping two advertisements
---
I like Auberdine!!!
---
Good thing a show is coming soon :)
---
How? That is my question. It is nice they are like uhh guys there are a ton more of you than we thought and a shit ton more on Herod. But thats not a fix, that is them asking for the players to fix it. And Stalagg was done awfully. They should have been like Herod has too high pop. We are going to open a new server in 5 days at this time. We encourage you to reroll. 
---
No one wants risking the names they are happy with on a server they were happy with until they learned its super full. 
---
I agree that its good they have put some focus on this issue. They should put some more. I don't know what they should do just had a few ideas... i do think they should do something.
---
I haven't read into it too much but from what i've glanced at they're letting people scale down to old level content and still having it be somewhat worth their time so they can play with friends leveling etc.
---
Basically you'll be able to go to old zones and scale to those levels, but most importantly you should be able to queue for dungeons across any expansion as a level 120 or any level thats high enough for the dungeon and you will be scaled down to the appropriate level for that dungeon kind of like how timewalking works now.
---
that's encouraging!
---
I’m 30 and grabbed my names already, but I also have a close-knit group of friends who will probably join up Sunday the 25th or day of on the 26th
---
I’ll risk all that instead of playing on a soon to be dead realm
---
If they built the server correctly on a bank of servers (AWS), they should have just increased the size to scale with the number of players.  Thats adding more CPUs, RAM, etc to accomidate all the extra people.  You would think they would have figured this out by now.
---
I like 3 since I could help grab my friends names since they got blizzfucked by the servers
---
100% agreed. I even tried to get mine on Stalagg but it was taken immediately. No clue how I lucked out on Herod
---
lovestospooge
---
My guild decided to occupy ourselves with making quite an impressive excel spreadsheet with our classes, roles, etc. And all kinds of crazy formulas to get different things 😌
---
HOW MANY PLAYERS WILL BE ABLE TO LOG IN AT ONCE IN P2? HOLY SHIT DUDE.
---
BLIZZARD WILL CAN/WILL LIMIT THAT # DUE TOTHE BELOW 2 REASONS: 
---
TECHNICAL REASONS
---
GAMEPLAY REASONS
---
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT NUMBER THAT IS. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PLAYERS ABLE TO LOG IN SIMULTANEOUSLY IN  P2
---
in this camp myself, why would anyone pay early for something we did forever ago
---
Shadowfang Keep and Scarlet Monastery runs.
---
As Alliance.
---
You realize its been done on private servers and some of those guilds will be coming to classic with the intent of week one rag. Not saying its easy but it is possible if the servers stay stable.The guilds and people planning this are well aware how long it takes to level and what is needed to clear Molten Core.
---
Your source?
---
Meh. It’s not so bad. Feed my pet uncooked meat from beasts while questing. My bag is overflowing in stv

Have fun with leeway!

When you are 60, raids are 50% of the game.  The other half is pvp.
---
Yours is from a time when AMD APUs weren't very good. A current Ryzen-based laptop will run WoW just fine.
---
Had Thunderfury as a Rogue in classic. The sheer amount of tells I would get a day by noobies “OMG WHERE DID YOU GET THAT” really made my day.
---
It reminded me of when I’d see a bunch of cool shit in FF11 or EQ and I’d admire all those hardcore players. Except this time, I, was the man.
---
LF nep on herod! ;w;
---
you sound bitter... and a little worried tbh
---
Someone above had a great idea of making a new server and for the first couple of days, only people with characters on Herod can transfer their character (and their names) to the new server. Then after people have time to decide if they want to switch, you open it up for everyone else to make characters on it.
---
Best I can do is $15 for the lot.
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler has a 3 charge Use: increase attack speed by 50% for 30 second ability. However, it is a level 29 weapon, with about a third of the weapon damage of a normal Pre-raid BiS (for Ret, at least).
---
This means that your damage is coming from Seal of Righteousness (spell damage each hit) and Lifestealing Enchant (spell damage scales weapon enchants that do damage).
---
So after you use the 3 charges (90 seconds of buff time), you need another Manual Crowd Pummeler. Hence, each boss. So you would need to farm a realistically impossible amount of time for the 5+ weapons that you have to get from Gnomer, and for the mats/gold for the Lifestealing Enchant
---
This post didn't contain doom. Unless you consider Blizzard is a doom poster.
---
Honestly, the replies i have gotten have been more than disappointing. In what way am i doom posting? Other than the Doom that Blizzard itself has already published themselves?
---
Not a bad idea!
---
\&gt; I  give classic 2 months for 50% active player drop off.  
---
so, like every expac since wrath then?
---
Lies. He has achieved 5 sigma. Don't worry if his data isn't publicly available and if it hasn't been peer reviewed.
---
Nah
---
I think it comes down to if you consider it "wasted time".  Most people who play on pvp servers see it as constructive time, learning your toon, tactics, joy, pain, etc.  Kind of leveling your(the player behind keyboard) skills in the same way that pve levels your toon.
---
It's not for everyone, and it's ok not to enjoy it.  For me, I would much rather pvp than raid...and consider end game pve a waste of time that I would rather not touch...tho I do do it a bit.  Many people even get so into twinking that their lvl 19 toon becomes their main and the 60's they have fall by the wayside.  But again, everyone is different.  I would recommend trying it, because I think it is so much more fun than pve and feel like you might miss out on something that is (subjective)great...but if it's something that just dosn't interest you there is nothing wrong with going pve instead.
---
I miss the early days of Cata. I actually felt like I was doing really well when I was able to heal through different fights
---
You made me spit out my water. Take your damn upvote you beautiful animal.
---
I don't really think you care, so I'm not going to. If you were genuinely interested, I'm sure you'd already know the other solutions. And if you don't, use your imagination, I'm sure you can think of something.
---
Too late
---
My first BOE purple was Bow of Searing Arrows... I was playing a mage. I will be playing a mage again, I hope for better loot this time. (My warrior still has the bow btw.)
---
This wouldn't have been a problem if they gave South America their own server, or just had more servers to begin with.  Only 3 East Coast PVP servers.  One is taken by streamers, and the other the realm chosen by SA players who are known to not be fun to play with.  Was it really a surprise that the average East Coast PVP player would pick the 3rd option?
---
And now that this server is guaranteed to be filled, and has what sounds like will be a good mix of players, people won't want to leave.  Herod is pretty much going to be *THE* pvp server for NA.  This isn't even the only full server either, and more and more are going to join leading up to and on launch day.  Really feel like they should've been able to handle this better.  Queues are going to be absolutely awful, and layering will be here much longer than they thought.
---
If only there was enough demand for new servers currently PepeHands
---
Eeeeeeeeeeeeesh
---
Raiding on high settings.
---
Not even kidding.
---
Yeah this is the problem. I would’ve been more than happy to switch if they had given people a proper announcement. For me, I am only invested in Herod because it was either that, or streamer/BR server. So I was forced to reserve my names there. 
---
They need to release another server properly this time and I’m sure a lot of us will switch, especially since we’ll have another chance for name reservation.
---
chunkylover53
---
That's fine if it worked for your group, but i know my group won't allow meme specs because if you allow one then everyone wants to raid in their pvp spec. Sure a raid of all moonkin healers might be able to clear some content, but definitely not all content and not efficiently.
---
Well just say that the first time lol. That's hella caps for a simple question. Though you won't see it answered. It does blizzard no good to answer that question now.
---
Me too!
---
Yea just make the name on the new server and try to be quick. It’s unfair and waste of resources to do “transfer” just cause a few people want to reserve a name
---
Truth I guess us literally throwing dollar bills at him changed his mind
---
If you're not Mt or an off tank, you're prio 3 for warrior loot at best
---
You have the audacity to tell somebody they can't play with their guild? In a lot of cases guilds chose the server long before it was 'full' and I can't make an entire guild move. 
---
&gt;People that subbed early, or were subbed to retail reserved spots on that realm.
---
No you reserved names, not spots. You've no more right to a place on that server than anybody else.
---
&gt;you're exacerbating the problem
---
You shouldn't join *your* guild on that server. Either *your* guild should move or *you* should find a new guild. By stubbornly maintaining that you will play with only those people, you're exacerbating the problem
---
It works both ways. Why is you think you've more right to the server? Because you setup a subscription first?
---
PvP will be wild. Maybe not to this extent until the layering is dissolved but rest assured, we’ll have our World War style PvP back. Classic, we missed you.
---
Three, technically.
---
To the people so sure that this is all speculation and OP may be blowing this out of proportion, do you really think Blizzard would make this post if they were only referring to 15 queues? It will be hours at the very least.
---
That's still 10.
---
"and a partridge in a pear tree" is 8
---
So maybe "and a time dragon named Chromie"
---
Though it's not my favorite. I'll keep thinking.
---
lmao
---
Worse, PvP death doesn't cause durability damage, but getting killed by lava or MC'd into a mob does.
---
Mark Kern (original WoW team lead) confirmed that realms would 'cap out at 3k players and place players into login queues long before then'. Those are his exact words from his discord AMA which he hosted in 2017 the night of the Blizzcon classic WoW announcement.
---
Here is what Blizzard said today
---
&gt;Based on name reservations, the Shazzrah realm is looking to be massively overpopulated. If all existing players remain there, login queues of 10,000 players are a certainty, possibly much higher
---
&gt;we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further even though we have the capacity to do so.
---
&gt;Raising realm caps would forestall the problem, more players at launch but an unsustainable situation down the line, severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan
---
Realms capped at 3k back then.  
---
Blizzard confirms classic realms will cap at 3k.  
---
Blizzard says "severe queues after we turn off layering"
---
I'd say you missed literally everything in the post considering we're still having this conversation. Whatever it is you do in your work life I sincerely hope you're not depended on for your reading comprehension skills.
---
Ohh, gotcha, I googled the weapon but thought it was just a random proc and not a on-use
---
This is not just protocol on RP-PVP, this is the true way of the rogue
---
5head move
---
Great write up, but how does smeld help you escape ganks ?
---
Yeah but which will be crowded months from now? Most likely the first ones they put out for name reservation.
---
Very good video, compelling too. But I’ll stick with my Orc. 
---
ZUG ZUG.
---
Why would they pay for half a month of game time they cannot use?  If they're not fussed about reserving a name, they are unlikely to sub weeks early.
---
Yeah... no. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
---
I'm not crying, your crying
---
Big brain move right here
---
They're giving you the choice, nothing more. Keep your name and suffer queues or change servers and possibly have a different name but no queues.
---
Spleenfat123
---
Yea, the highest I ever got was rank 9 (Knight-Champion). It's nice to fantasize about rank 14 but realistically almost none of us will ever see it, lol. Still though, to be in the top 10 for a week is still damn impressive! Congrats :)
---
I'm doing the following (with varying levels of success)
---
+ Guild Website (via google sites)
---
+ Database (to track guild roster, attendance, loot history, raid history)
---
+ learning how to write-addons (because sometimes you want something simple without bloat)
---
+ Loot distribution flowchart (for complete transparency): This is already done.
---

---
I was writing up a 'siming' script in python, but gave up for the moment (by the time I get back to level 60 and need it I'll focus on it properly).
---
I'm sure they will switch servers when they are sitting in a 3 hour queue every night.
---
People like to be mad and think they are right, it's hilarious
---
I have no idea what that means or if it's good or bad.
---
get fucked reddit nerds 
---
this meme is true as fuck
---
that’s a lotta caps
---
Classic easily. Current game sucks
---
I will be playing on a 2008 Mac Pro with a GTX670. No issues with FPS in the stress test.
---
It was released in WOTLK 
---
and no I don't think there should be achievement points. I don't want people asking for me to post my achievement in order to get into a raid
---
Spotted the American 😘
---
I can't believe I watched that all the way through. I must be very desperate for classic. Shut up and take my upvote.
---
The "gnome suit" thing is a bit weird since that's not how dragons in WoW work, but it's your meme, you do it however you want! I'm more curious to see 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 TBH. Some of them are going to be tough!
---
Abjurer's Robe
---
Definitely possible, I just believe knowing true numbers before launch gives a healthier chance on the correct amount of servers being ready.
---
X
---
As I hope my data is incorrect and the people on Herod do not have to deal with this.  But it doesn't change the evaluation from the blue post.
---
Yeah it is. Also you get some pet damage buff right? But trolls look way cooler.
---
That's not free
---
Unless there's another option to do it automatically now, I've not looked. Doesn't matter what the reason is blizzard have the sub whether they unfreeze it or not. They have done it before there's no reason they can't. I did it simply because I was going on holiday iirc.
---
There’s currently 6 pvp servers...
---
My group has hopped all over the place. We planned going Faerlina then the streamer crew went there, so we had to swap. Then we swapped our reserves to Herod and now it's supposedly way overcrowded. So, now we're on Stalagg and that's gonna be full soon. So who knows how launch will be.
---
No matter what happens there's going to be a fuckton of people who don't login before the 26th or later (not everyone absolutely HAS to play the moment it launches),  its going to be a fair amount of guesswork on blizzards part no matter what.
---
Thought it was not as good as Hurricane's other work, but then I realized it wasn't made by him, good job nonetheless.
---
Too busy speed running to make guides!
---
Username checks out
---
The other mc ones are not still upgrades from blues?
---
Those Chad arms aren't even in retail 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Why do you want to do that?
---
this is great hype fuel
---
This assclown is President of Blizzard Entertainment now.
---
Thanks for the clarification. 
---
You make a solid case for not having it
---
Do hunters kind of have to go engineer for the thorium ammo?
---
By that logic they think Streamers are rolling on Stalagg? Never seen anyone say or claim any of this i think most went to the faeri sounding server. 
---
For your claim to be accurate there would need to be good evidence or a belief, that streamers from HEROD (or other servers) moved to Stalagg. This of course isn't the case. Logic. I am the dumby yet, you make arguments like this.
---
Some one's watching Dr.Stone.
---
I'm with you, OP.  It's not about being "fair" like the other comments want.  It's about trying to actually fix the problem at hand.  
---
I think this would be a viable strategy to try and solve it.  At least to a certain extent.
---
oh. uhhhh. awkward. at least shadow priests heal better than retadins.
---
You don't have any way to confirm or measure that. It's pure speculation. The smart move is to avoid the problem in the first place. People need to spread out more onto other servers. Somebody should move. Maybe not you, but some should.
---
Couldn't care less*
---
It was always the plan to start small and scale up as needed
---
The load on launch day is inherently unpredictable.. that's why layering fixes so many problems and they can afford to have less servers and scale up
---
Yes, but that is obviously at GM's discretion.  They probably aren't going to let it fly between now and launch for this exact reason.  Make no mistake they want their extra ~$6.
---
Pure gold.
---
Let me get this straight, your cool with having queue times chopped out of your daily wow login and play time for 2-3 weeks while other servers blow past you in progression because their whole guild can actually get online at desired times?
---
I have a problem. Blizz pls fix, I don’t care if anyone else is affected, only me is important.
---
3 on east coast.  This is assuming  you go to your optimized ping.
---
Have about 500gb SSD and not sure on the PS,
---
Just playing classic! Thanks!
---
Thanks!
---
I enjoyed it somewhat in Wrath when it first came out but now it’s just obnoxious.
---
Makes high quality video. Uses default font...
---
I guess they wanted to make sure each realm would be at a specific population minimum before launch for long term server / community health and weren't 100% on the sort of population to expect.
---
So they wait for the current realms to hit their population goals before opening more, and they see now that it's not quite going to plan, so they're urging people to switch so it does. 
---
But had we had 5-6 realms, we may have ended up with several realms being below the population threshold they want, and that could have lead to a situation like this anyway - where people see those realms aren't filling up, and go to the others because they're worried of playing on a dead server.
---
So we could have had 5-6 realms with only 3 of them full anyway.
---
We’re going home boys.
---
We’re going home.
---
I had the opposite experience. I didn't login until ~30 minutes after Stalagg went live and got all 3 of the names I wanted that I didn't manage to get on Herod.
---
Please tell me you’re the one I’m in. You’ll know if you see your post on our Discord Paladin chat.
---
Die, Bart, die.
---
They said they could go beyond what their soft cap is now, they have yet to hit a hard cap, but don't want to make the problem any worse.
---
I  hope so, but good luck.
---
where did you get cartographer? that hasn't been updated since WOTLK.
---
Some of you guys really care about not risking losing your  reserved name than having it be raid time but your main tank is stuck in a 2 hour queue?
---
I believe if they are on the opposite faction, they are only able to see your character name. Appearing offline does not work in classic wow, it will set you to busy when you launch the game.
---
Back to back blockbuster video game champion
---
I have been playing for less than 6 months with my husband, who is an amazing teacher, but I found your posts and think they are absolutely awesome! Thanks to you and your wife for all of your help. Much appreciated!!!
---
How else can this be interpreted. I'm completely dumbstruck by your responses and have no idea what you're reading or thinking.
---
I really don't care about streamers and I don't derive any pleasure from ganking.

Step three: pump the mage's arm till your inventory is 30% full of water.

Step four: follow the tank, mashing heal!

What’s with the Herod hate??
---
Thank you, I haven't gotten to Undercity to train in Twitter yet.
---
I like the thought of him coming in one day and just retiring, choosing the first person he sees to take over his multi billion dollar company
---
Does anyone remember the guys name who kept making hunter after hunter in an attempt to perfect the fastest time to 60? He had like 11 hunters at 60 by the time I got my second toon to 60. He would post updates all the time to the community I wish I could remember his name.
---
Striker's Mark and Blastershot are both gonna be good upgrades over the blues.
---
I suggested the same along with 2 other ideas.. was pilloried. reddit is kinda bipolar.
---
Well it might not be incorrect, so far they specifically said "dungeon loot" eye of shadow wouldn't fall under dungeon loot. Thorium brotherhood was also in the beta, so it's also a potential that nightfall will be in phase 1, despite not being added in vanilla until patch 1.5 which would be phase 3.
---
I hope they answer this in the Q&amp;A thats coming up, so we can have a clear answer. All of their answers so far to this situation has only left more questions to be answered, as they never went in detail.
---
I thought the development of diablo mobile was outsourced?
---
You're a good friend.
---
Blizzard never guaranteed anyone a name.  They opened servers based on internal projections and then, based on actual numbers, opened more servers to meet high demand.  Now, the choice is yours: do you want the name you reserved on Herod or do you actually want to play the game?  
---
They’ve clearly warned you a full 10-days ahead of launch about what you can expect if you stay.  You are informed and what you choose to do with that information is on you.  But, it seems pretty childish to throw a tantrum and stubbornly refuse to take action in your own best interest unless some kind of special accommodation is made for you.  A name isn’t a very compelling reason to ruin your classic experience and waste 2+ weeks on principle when you could simply move to another available server.  Especially considering you haven’t so much as stepped foot in the server yet.
---
I haven't seen this in 12 years. Wow
---
WoW... Hmm.......
---
Keep in mind 3 of the 4 end game weapons you're likely to use are crossbows which don't get the benefit from that. Only rhok'delar will benefit from that passive, which gets replaced by the xbow off Chromagus in BWL. 
---
So while the math would indicate it's really good, in reality it's not great. Berserking is definitely more of a dps boost than the pet dmg boost for orcs though in pve. But seriously, the stun resist is so good always. Mediocre rogues won't even bother to try with you a lot of the time.
---
Steve
---
There are good MMOs around now? Where?! They’re releasing WoW from 2005, that’s how bad today’s mmos are.
---
And my axe!
---
90% of my bnet friends don't even communicate anymore lol.
---
U BRING GROG?
---
I see hurricane I upvote
---
Sweet Jesus G4. I miss that.
---
Yeah but this time around people are paying. It's harder to switch servers like a ferret when you invested actual money in them.
---
Game launches at 6pm EST. nobody is going to bed after only 4 hours after sitting in a massive queue.
---
Shimmering flats is one of my favorite zones, its good at early-mid 30s.   Desolace also works. and i believe theres some quest in alterac mountains and alterac valley as well.
---
Why is everyone so afraid of PvP servers.....you don't even lose anything when you die. Just whatever little bit of time it takes to run back to your corpse.
---
It's not like you drop your inventory, or lose your character, or die in real life. Like you would with some other games. PvP servers are already care-bear compared to those games. PvE servers are just zzzzzz might as well just play a single player game at that point.
---
I'm switching to hemo/prep spec at 32 in preparation for STV.  Should give a huge edge in staying alive.
---
It's not about necessity, it's about customisation and choice.
---
Just because a group of streamers agree to roll on a server doesn't vouch for the entire streaming community.  How hard is it to get that?  Did Summit1G agree to this?  Did Sequisha agree to this?  There are several streamers who play wow and know nothing of this agreement to roll on Farelina.
---
The person is definitely wrong in saying it was in the blue post but I do recall Blizzard stating that each layer would be the equivalent size of a server from vanilla back in a post about bug fixes I believe. They clarified it because people were worried it would be the sizes that were being seen on the closed beta.
---
Ok, I dont care about them.
---
Pandaria and Legion were dope, fight me.
---
Oh snap! Scarab Lord Jugador checking in. I rang that gong.
---
Sorry I was kind of a dick back then.
---
Addons boi
---
You can't cast Power Word: Shield on people not in your party.
---
I strong disagree. I played on a private sever with 10k cap and it was NOT the vanilla I remember. it was unbearable, every enemy was dead and all I did was compete for kills for hours in every single zone.
---
Its only medium pop because so few people are moving to it. The truth is no one want to risk it on a server that looks like its gonna die. Now at release i fully expect its population to be more than fine maybe even max out.
---
Had they done what i or the op has suggested you would have seen a TON more people move.
---
It's Chinese.
---
Haha and you actually think they won't be able to detect that?  So naive.
---
right like nobody even goes to the top half unless they’re going to duskwood
---
on illidan we've had 3-4+ hour queues before, this is completely reasonable

I played wow for a few months during BC but never got a character over 30. I've actually got a group of friends for raiding so I'm looking forward to it this time. Only shame is that I was alliance when I played and my friends were horde back then so they want to roll alliance now so no shaman for me :(
---
What a coincidence. My enemies usually do a /pee emote on my corpse after they gank me. R Kelly would be proud.
---
Yep. There won't even be battlegrounds until phase 3.
---
Yeah agreed. Blizzard really needs to do more about this.
---
Whats ur name
---
See, I tried that but then a patch dropped right before reservations came up. By the time I closed the client, downloaded the patch, and relaunched the game servers were already up and I was put in a few-thousand long queue.
---
Name?
---
Bruh they announced and opened Stalagg in the span of like 3 hours lol.  That's on Blizzard.  I would have been down to move.
---
That was amazing
---
How long after launch until phase 3? And how long do people expect it to take to hit 60
---
Death Knights
---
doing this will filter addons that work for classic?
---
Overachiever
---
lul
---
Help mama
---
Both Pacific PVP are full...
---
Um.
---
For the sake of fairness, people should roll need on BOE purple items that are BIS for me also. It's not a selfishness thing. Gold gives everyone more flexibility.
---
I get that, was going for a little absurdity. Some of them will be a bit meta, but overall I'm hoping to capture the feel of the wait for Classic we've all endured mixed with some in game jokes as well :)
---
I may lose my job over this. But I must hit 60. Whatever it takes.
---
That channel is gold thanks!
---
Tldr; spec shadow and duo with a friend if/when u can
---
Me too and no one can complain now because we have been warned and given the opportunity to act. Anyone that keep sitting on their server has no right to complain about queues later.
---
Nice. Glhf
---
6 months after release, ~200 hours
---
I am skeptical we will see a high percentage of warriors continue past 40.
---
Changing layer isn't like ordering food off a menu.  If an enemy level 20 switches layer you can't just select the one they fled to from a list...
---
Stop making fucking stupid posts.
---
Yikes.
---
For sure it is man. But like, China and all
---
thanks for giving me a new area to corpse-camp
---
Yup! [Here's a guide for it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/filtering-reddit)
---
Then why come comment in a thread specifically about her art?
---
Technically it’s totally fine to play classic with. Best upgrades though would be a new GPU, next best would be 8 GB more of RAM.
---
Much truth.  I had little need for stealthing, so I would see how close I could get to mobs before stealthing and hit them with a cheap shot.
---
You'd be surprised how good you can get at consistently aggroing a mob *and* going into stealth.  Every time it feels like I saved a half second making them run to me.  Those half seconds add up!
---
This would have been removed if it weren't for "low mod week" which is a crying shame.
---
Remove the art and comics and (lame) memes for all I care but this stuff is gold.
---
Really only version of achievements were titles and there aren't many and they are difficult to get. Dassaboutit
---
So consumables and epic mounts don't exist in your world?
---
It's not on Blizzard that everyone decided to go to Herod. I'm no Blizzard apologist, but it's not their fault if people remain on Herod and get stuck in 5 hour long queues. They're giving the players plenty of information on the population health of the servers. Just go add a "z" to your name and it'll probably be available on Stalagg.
---
It's hard to avoid stv completely. Desolace, dustwallow, thousand needles all have little pockets of quests here and there, but at some point you'll be lead back to STVietnam. Unless you dungeon grind hard
---
I think most people here are expecting way more people playing this than what will be the case. There will be a steep decline. Especially after the first couple months. 
---
The community will be great. The nostalgia will be glorious. The bigger challenge will be there. But so will 2006 gameplay. And that is going to be a problem for a lot of people. I grew up playing Everquest and tried going to project 99 plenty of times and never could stay because the gameplay is so old and aged. I think the same will happen here.
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you. I just don't think that they will get an accurate count until day 1 of release. That's when they'll be best to release more servers and get the most out of it. It won't affect me but I just don't want to have them to merge servers at all. It'll be best if people can keep ttheir sever community the whole time. 
---
Either way, no matter what people say blizzard wants to keep subs and return subs so they will do the best they can for the long term. It's always about the long term.
---
this truly had nothing to do with what i said. good job assuming what the true server cap w/ layering is though btw.
---
Price for the performance right now new I'd go vega 56. Hardware swap has deals galore though.
---
To add to that, get in guild and make friends. So if you do get camped for some reason you call for back up! Then it really starts to get fun. Some best experiences come out of WPvP
---
Looking for "Greed" on Fairbanks.
---
For Grob specifically there will be an abundance of guilds in all NA time zones because it is the only option for RPPVP. You will be fine.
---
LF/WTB Birdy/Dirt on Whitemane
---
He literally didn't say "no one wants it". And he's literally right that a ton of players are going to try Classic and realize they miss a lot of the conveniences and speed of modern WoW, or realize they don't have time in their modern life to play like they used to. (They think they do, but they don't.) That's going to happen for some non-zero subset of players, and maybe even the majority of players. We won't know until like 3 months from now.
---
Further, Blizzard's official line about Vanilla servers was always "we don't think there's actually enough demand to make it worthwhile". And I have a feeling that up until ~6 years ago the demand likely genuinely was not there (despite what the people with private server blinders on like to tell themselves). Things change over time. The situation changes. People change. Opinions change. 
---
Brack announced Vanilla as a sign of humility, a way of admitting he was wrong about the demand for it. That maybe it was worth it. Maybe there were enough players interested for it to have a vibrant community. And people STILL kept shitting on him. It's really sad that people can't let go of their grievances and move on with their lives.
---
There was a lot a few weeks back, they’ve died off because your comment is the general consensus and people got the idea after the first few. It does run on an updated client rather than the original, so your pc should probably be slightly better than what you ran in 06 lol, but I’d say 2 potatoes duck taped together would do the trick
---
No one knows how long it'll be until phase 2
---
No one except Blizzard knows when phase 3 will come out
---
Can you switch specs like bfa? No.
---
Can you change specs? Yes, pay a trainer to reset your talent tree for an increase per use amount until you cap at 50g. 50g in vanilla is an amount of gold that really hurts but isn't the end of the world if you do it once a week. In phase 2 you should be able to grind out 50gb in an hour or two using dire maul.
---
That got better and better.
---
Yeah corrupting my padawan was surprisingly satisfying for me lol.
---
Ordered one of my Dwarf Hunter many years ago during TBC as well. I was annoyed I couldn't get it made with the Grand Masters rifle so ended up having a mix of TBC gear and level 60 PVP Gear.
---
can confirm classic WoW works 100% zero issues via lutris with DXVK and Vulkan drivers installed (for both amd and nvidia users) 
---
in my testing i had 75fps (vsync on with a 75hz monitor) at maximum settings even during the stress test  
---
im running an i7-6700k, a vega 56 flashed to a 64 bios, and way too much ram.
---
Some of the most overlooked talents are in the combat tree. Improved sprint and improved kick vs a frost mage are game changers! I feel as though a rogue can do well with the popular specs such as 31/8/12(daggers) and 21/3/27(hemo), but you can create a custom spec with a lot of points in combat tree and be more effective in bg’s.
---
Absolutely not. It takes way too long, the Hunter calls for backup, and I get slaughtered by 5 Horde by the time I kill his pet. Hunters are the best base defenders in the game for a reason.
---
I prefer to partner with a Rogue, coordinate Hibernate on the pet + Sap on the Hunter, and cap the flag while he's in CC. Actually killing him takes way too long.
---
Love it!
---
Are you speaking from private server experience here or actual vanilla naxx?
---
Yeah not making at LEAST 25% of new content in Azeroth is really what led to killing the game, more than anything I think.
---
Second is class homogenization and overly catering to casual play... which vanilla actually did just not for all content.
---
Literally nothing except reserving three of your names
---
pure fiction
---
Pop is gonna be big now.
---
I gotta say, when people make fun of Blizzard for the whole "you don't want it" stuff, it kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I know it's mostly just memes, and that's fine. But they are right about the bug fixes and massive improvements made to the game client and interfaces over the years. I imagine when they said "you think you do but you don't", they were not envisioning the same game that we are getting in Classic. Blizzard has put in some incredible work to replicate the Vanilla experience in a polished way.
---
brilliant, game changing, looking forward to attempting hopefully it works you've saved my fingers.
---
This is a really good idea. Blizzard gets 24 hrs to get servers in order and ensure launch is smooth - all while only missing out on only 1 days worth of subscriptions.
---
Too bad they would rather have a shitty launch but make more money.
---
Someone give this man some fucking gold
---
Foredoomed &gt; Drakedog
---
This is my plan and it's actually happening
---
lol
---
I made a female troll shaman named Thexi on Herod so i’m not complaining
---
My bad, i got wooshed.   
---
I sounded like a dick lol.
---
Also be sure to remember that bills are due and you both still need to go to work to pay them.
---
If you dont enjoy actively ganking and griefing people in the open world, you should question why you are even rolling on a PvP server.
---
So many people are attracted to the socially created hype that is wow Wpvp, but the reality of it is much more simplistic and bland.
---
You will get killed in the most pointless, unfair and inconvenient ways possible..... all for the notion of "fun", because once BGs hit, the amount of organized world pvp is literally gone forever.
---
All that will remain is people protecting farming routes, hours of battles over world PvE content and your random griefing to destroy people otw to dungeons and raids.
---
Playing rise against and fucking all you horde up as a ret paly.
---
I saw an interesting suggestion to "Clone" Herod (or any full server) so that people on Herod from the get go have a characters on said server, which would make it a lot easier for whole h
---
Guilds or groups to migrate!
---
That’s fair boys. As long as you’re having fun nothing else matters
---
We all were friend. We all were.
---
"But as blizzard said if a population is too big removing layering could cause "severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan." and I think they would rather leave in layering"
---
No, they'll do exactly what they did today, and highly recommend people stop rolling on overpopulated realms.  If people choose to ignore this advice then it's their own fault and they'll have to deal with the queues.  Tough titty.
---
can you link his stream mate?
---
I genuinely don't understand how people are treating "when we turn layering off before phase 2" as either a news item or a surprise. It's literally the first thing Ion said about layering.
---
&gt;imagine being j. allen brack
---
Pass
---
I'M GOING TO USE THIS FOR EVERYTHING. Reddit beware.
---
Your claim is people are not moving to Stalagg because of streamers (as Herod will not have them?) So your current arguments both apply equally to Herod and Stalagg. Sorry about that burden of proof is on you.. 
---
The truth is streamers have nothing to do with why people aren't moving to Stalagg.
---
I’m kindve low key pissed I didn’t know about these. I would’ve bought like 5 those are so freaking cool
---
World PvP. Loved meeting in STV, near Dire Maul and crossroads.
---
Running a 3% run twice gives you more chance to get something than only running it once. It’s not the chance of it dropping it’s the chance of you getting it. 
---
A better example might be if you imagine trying to flip a coin until you get heads. The odds of getting heads vs tails remain the same every flip but the odds of you getting a heads eventually increases the more times you flip it.
---
 If I tell you I’ll give you a million dollars if you flip a coin and it lands on heads you would much rather flip it a hundred times rather than only once because yours odds of winning the million dollars is much higher the more times you flip the coin.
---
I wont transfer unless I get my name on at least one character

Hi, /u/KingAceNumber1
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/crhufw/i_just_want_to_play_classic/). 
---
Read them you have? Real page turners they are
---
Hunter rotation isn't hard either its literally just Aimed shot and Multishot with auto's weaved in
---
Because when they remove layering we're back to a 3k cap. If they create a hundred layers per server we're looking at severe overpopulation in phase2
---
Oh neat, didn't realize the easy servers were in Chicago. I'm in the midwest, solves that question for me! Thanks for the reply
---
rly confused why you would want to be self sufficient in a social MMORPG. There's literally no reason or benefit of being so.
---
Hunters has the highest gold per hour from farming diremaul tribute. You need engineering and optimally you have enchanting as well, so you can use that as your enchant char, and be properly self sufficient in enchants as well. 
---
Get alchemy on the alt, consider dropping tailoring for LW for your devilsaur.
---
Came here to post this.
---
What were they
---
Consider who is reserving names right now: people who already are subbed. 90% of those people are going to be retail players. They're going to drop Classic as soon as a new retail patch comes out. They're the people most likely to stop playing it. Obviously those 10% non-retail players who only subbed to reserve their names are likely the most hardcore, and due to network effects the name reservations are likely still a good way to gauge interest and relative server population, but still, try to keep things in perspective.
---
The original cap was a design decision, not a hardware limit
---
Don't think Enchanting on a 35 is worth it since any good enchants are from rep which you wont have. If you just want an alt to d/e things, just have a level 1.
---
The best stuff happened far away from Goldshire, anyway.
---
If your hearthstone is not on CD you destroy it then death skip and pick the HS back up when you go to an innkeeper next.
---
dumbass would be a more fitting name for you honestly.
---
They prefer "Edgar Allen Hoe", I'm told.
---
Dire Maul is catch-up content for MC because it makes MC easier, but you still have an incentive to do it. Lvl 61 content is a skip because you no longer need to do MC at all.
---
I did this back in the day during vanilla days.  It's not hard, just have to have zero responsibilities.
---
I thought this would be helpful for people to see this close to launch.  This diagram has helped me estimate on which day I should hit level 60. This diagram was created by /u/Strobber7 and the original post can be viewed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq847f/diagram_of_the_average_time_needed_each_lvl/).
---
So I should take a picture of my liquor cabinet and post it with fake hype to reddit? Or do you want pictures of my freezers with actual food in them?
---
People will seemingly do anything to be noticed on reddit I guess.
---
Yes. Bliz has stated transfers will be in
---
theyd have to really be reaching to ban that, do it coward, doubt ull get any type of ban at all
---
while im not specifically saying your example wouldn't work, this is a classic case of homogenization balancing. The problem is each change seems like a good idea, but when you implement them you suddenly realize youre pushing things together slowly.
---
The formula is essentially this:
---
Look at class/hero/faction/etc -&gt; identify weakness causing it to be non-viable -&gt; smooth out the weakness to make it not cripple the entity.
---
This will lead to you doing the same process to dozens, or even hundreds of other instances. Each one of these small changes in a vacuum seem smart, but then after a while you look at it and go "well a boomkin and mage are functionally just different forms of the same exact thing". Then you get into a situation that, them competing for the exact same niche with very similar properties means if either one is even a little better than the other it immediately consumes the role entirely. Then the only way to make it so both will be brought is to make them equal in power level, and the only real way to do that is make them basically the same thing.
---
The proper way to maintain class identity is to give them something that makes their weakness worthy of coping with. So that this exchange happens "boomkins have mana issues", "yes, but they're good anyway because _______". Much like shadowpriests in TBC are super mediocre dps, but they're definitely worth bringing for their mana-battery properties.
---
If in TBC shadowpriests were essentially just warlocks that would go oom and didn't do as much damage, would the solution be to make shadowpriests do more damage and be more mana efficient? No, because then they're just warlocks.
---
Icefrog (from DotA fame) does an excellent job at this. He will often make changes that sort of make no sense from the content of a heroes problem. I can remember countless instances of patch notes where people for months have been like "Naix sucks, he just gets kited around and dies. He needs to be faster or his slow needs to be better". Then icefrog took Rage and buffed the shit out of it, but left him with a low range slow and unimpressive move speed. Everyone was like "what the fuck this isn't what he needs". But then they suddenly realized, holy shit rage is crazy good now. Like, you can just build a radiance and speed items and it doesn't matter cause Rage gives him like 10 seconds of magic immunity with a ~6 second down time, he's like sleeper crazy good now despite having that same weakness. They've since changed him a few more times, but its an example of instead of just going "yes naix has this mobility problem that cripples him compared to other carries, lets just change some stuff so he doesn't suffer from this problem as much" they went "lets double down on his strengths so he becomes this unique entity with his own niche".
---
I'm not a professional game designer so I don't know how you'd increase the relevance of a boomkin without just buffing it's weaknesses. If they implemented some shit like a talent 0/3 "33/66/100% chance when you critically strike with a direct damage spell to reduce the cooldown of party members abilities by 2%". Suddenly it wouldn't matter that much that the boomkin has mana issues, because you popped like 5 cooldowns at the start of the fight and he scored 15 crits, he'd have reduced all your 3 minute cooldowns by almost a minute and 5 minute cooldowns by a minute and a half.
---
Save blizzard is the one who said their is a problem right? And they are saying its going to affect a lot of people right? 
---
How is your snarky comment even remotely reflective of reality? 
---
Hit its not. Try to think a bit. I personally  have lots of time for queues i played wow at back in beta, i played mmos before this. I don't enjoy queues but i can handle them. I have older friends with far less flexible jobs who i am more concerned for related to the queues themselves. However, this isn't even about them. 
---
What it is about is effective ways to get the results BLIZZARD wants (avoid massively over or under populated server). That is why its not just a single idea.
---
99% of people don't know shit about streamers.
---
Go pvp it's really the full experience. Yeah it might sting a bit to get ganked, but it'swell worth the experience. 
---
BG's arent added before phase 3, that's like 6 months of gameplay without BG's.
---
12 hours to reach 60?
---
Hamstring kiting still works, I used it on the recent stress test. 
---
This video explains it pretty well: https://youtu.be/2Rsx2ARJyXY
---
You can pick a PvE server and flag yourself as PvP (not really like WarMode) then if you feel the ganking is too much you can flag off (which isn't possible on a PvP realm).
---
Since it is 2019 and all servers have a discord World PvP can be organized on discord, so you should still be able to get your PvP fix on a PvE server.
---
I need to move to the EU! The women are attractive and when I get older and weirder I will just be another guy in town.
---
old models were hotter
---
I haven't subscribed either. But they have plenty of time to add new servers if needed. I'm sure they will have servers ready to go that first week.
---
Anything higher than medium will have a healthy population down the road
---
Yes and yes
---
For some reason classic runs quite poor for me even on extremely low settings.
---
We're talking like 20fps zoomed in to a wall max.
---
Yet pservers run at around 40fps in a raid...
---
Anyone have any ideas?
---
I have checked for driver updates but apparently everything is up to date.
---
Thanks.
---
They won't do that cos guilds would be torn apart...
---
People losing their name is and community
---
Details! I used recount for years and refused to use anything else but then after using details it way better. Their classic version still has a couple bugs but should be good by release
---
Consider yourself fought.
---
Because if you read the rest of this post, you would see that they plan to remove layering for all realms by phase 2 even at the cost of additional queue time. 
---
Selective hearing at its best... Or in this case, selective reading.
---
Great answer thanks. Yeah one of the reason I don't want to play Warlock for example is Soulshard management is so annoying so I was hoping to avoid anything like that and yeah it sounds like rogues consumables are pretty manageable so I'll be giving it a shot.
---
love it!
---
Do you have the link to that thread/article? would like to read the rest, thanks.
---
Never going to happen.  BR gamers have been an absolute cancer in every game I have run into them.  I had a perma-red in Lineage 2 dedicated to killing BR players who refused to respect any of the etiquette in that game.  Nearly every player on my ignore list in CS was Brazilian.  
---
I have no clue why, but those fuckers are consistently the most toxic pieces of shit in games.
---
So unlike all your #nochanges posts, you are actually okay with #somechanges then?
---
lol.  You are on reddit right?
---
   Heroic strike is just weapon damage + flat damage, there isn't any coefficient added to the weapon damage other than 100%. Having a faster weapon would actually give you better dps with heroic strike because you are only gaining the flat amount of +damage on your next swing.
---
 It's not like an instant attack like whirlwind, sinister strike, or mortal strike where having a slow weapon was actually more dps because the instant attack gave you a dps increase just from the weapon having higher end damage. This is why they added weapon normalization. Slow weapon(with high top end damage) with instant attacks was too much dps in the mind of Blizzard.
---
Reminds me of Plague Inc. somehow. Could be a nice little scenario, get the whole world addicted to Classic. Put points towards Insomnia, get every country infected and slowly start putting points in explosive diarrhea. Some geek research centers are popping up, trying to find a cure. After hearing a fabled story of a weapon Sword of a Thousand Truths. The race is on.
---
They've literally never merged a server in the 15 year history of the game, and you think they're going to start now?
---
the mere fact that nostralius existed means i will never believe anyone who says blizzard knows better
---
Bro
---
Wait, people give a shit about the name of the server they are on?
---
No. Everyone can create their characters right now. It's not like we're in some special early access club. Numbers will go up sure but not by much, those who are interested have created their characters
---
It's not really a change. You could do this in vanilla by simply logging out and back in while on a flight path. Put down your pitchfork
---
Farming Mats, is less time consuming that farming gold alot of the time. I find, and playing warrior it's a bit more stable than grinding. 
---
Time isn't always going to be on my side so I am opting to have ALTs who can bridge the gap. 
---
Are Dire Mail Tribute Runs high focus/APM grind? I plan to have the second 60 on another account so I can play simultaneously. Again saving time in my life as much as possible!
---
Neither will that current model human.
---
Thanks Chromie!
---
Are you 12? Seems very likely to get a ban/suspension pretty quickly.

THIS... 
---
This is the point in WoW where I became discouraged and left.  I came back for a bit with each expansion, but I never played like I did before.  
---
The mob screamed that they not only had a right to participate in all of the content, but they demanded that they be successful at completing it.  CC was just too hard!
---
I had so much fun in early Cata, and when they took that away, it pretty much destroyed the game for me.

I was the opposite, speedrunner who wrote a guide then got so busy writing the guide hardly had time to speedrun lol

i feel like everyone with his mentality needs to be replaced at blizzard if classic wow is successful.  they've pointed the ship in the wrong direction for more than 10 years
---
I'm so damn ready for this. Everyone on PVP servers is going to get stuck in STV because nobody will let anyone quest. It's going to be insane.
---
MY WIFE MADE THIS PLEASE HELP ME FARM KARMA

Are you 12
---
I dont think that their is a right and a wrong way to play WoW. Especially during the level phase many players play alone. Later they have to include others player but I cant see what is wrong with their play style. Back to topic: Nearly every class combo should work fine. WL+ Healer is very strong for leveling!
---
You sell those?? Everyone else uses it for First Aid.
---
Wow you're hilarious bro. Hopefully you're like 12 otherwise that's pathetic
---
I'm just thankful I'm looking to play on a PvE server and dont have a guild. I can switch to whatever the hell I want if my first choice gets long queues and my name is never taken.
---
I knew like three people in Vanilla with all reps exalted.
---
It wasn't infinite back then.  There was a time frame it would function outside of range.  Once the time frame expired if the target had not returned to range the spell would interrupt.  No different than casting a spell as a npc walks out of range.  Eventually if its a long cast he can get to far before cast finishes and the game cancels.  Occasionally lag would cause this effect to continue, as damage dealt was static and not refunded, this lag was associated with the spell extending duration, but was not the actual case.
---
The god damn goosebumps. That was fantastic.
---
Except that if people spread out there would be 0 queues right now
---
Yeah I change my mind every day. Back to mage right now ;)

No worries! Sure, almonds have some protein but nuts tends to be very calorie dense. Some cold cut turkey perhaps? You can't have protein? Surely you must to have some to not waste away 🙂
---
Ah, it's the clueless guy that makes no sense. Here is what blizzard said, and I've yet to see what your interpretation is (probably because you are an idiot)
---
I massively disagree on the mats part, and warrior can make gold or mats quite quickly. If you really lacking in time, leveling several alts is not in your interest. One warrior with mining+engineering that farms gold with a shaman/paladin in DME is the best option for optimal play. 
---
As for tribute run, it's high focus not really high apm. You have to play careful because you can die quite easily. Here's an example of it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x95kTb9ky8Y
---
Not really duelbox possible. But if you are decent at duelboxing you could level a shaman/paladin and 2man DME solo, it's not that hard to do basically just /follow and play the warrior then alttap to start heals. here's how to DME jump run https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVUKcRqesto
---
They gave like an hours notice and a lot of people on the west coast were still at work.
---
You can say that, but it's undoubtedly one of the factors that led to Herod's massive population.
---
I actually stayed away from warlocks and a couple other classes until recently for the same reason, I always hated the idea of constantly managing and keeping track of the shards or not having them when you need it etc. but I’ve actually been playing lock on a wotlk server for the past couple weeks just to pass time and there’s macros that basically do it for you, so it’s not as bad as it sounds. But if you’re going for low maintenance as I always have, I feel like you’ll fall in love with rogue. They’re pretty much self sufficient, I mean obviously they have to get potions and other consumes like anyone else, but beyond that, your able to craft pretty much everything you need for super cheap and barely any hassle. And the poisons last an hour and I’m pretty sure also persist through death, so you don’t have to reapply every time you die. Based on what you’ve said, I’d say rogue is the class for you man, and I say that as someone who mained one for years and have played every class but hunter.
---
Not true, this is what blizzard said today paraphrased:
---
What melee weapons do I have to learn to use them as an orc hunter?
---
That's great! Can you make more so I can buy one?
---
I don’t know if you ever played vanilla but, in Blizzards defense, there were times where you could spam for a long ass time and still not be able to get a tank or healer for your dungeon run.  The nature of vanilla made it really difficult to enjoy the game as a tank or healer outside of instances and raids, and without the dual/multi spec system, it was expensive to switch your spec often.  This lead to a huge drought of tanks and healers, and Blizzard only solved it partially in BC by making paladins more viable tanks, giving them to the Horde, and giving us DKs.
---
Can't wait to go there with piece of mind on my pve realm :)
---
You should keep it so you get banned.
---
Oh forgot to mention that. I’m also in Windows 10 since the latest supported OS for Mac Pro 2008 is El Capitan.
---
 Now there is hacks to install High Sierra which works great for everything else but WoW crashes at startup with an error about missing CPU instructions. Legion worked fine but not BfA which Classic runs on. 
---
 The GPU supports metal trough Nvidia web drivers but doesn’t help since it has issues with the GPU. 
---
 So Windows 10 was the solution for me too.
---
So, wherever baron longshore spawned last. Or the raptor pen.
---
I really don’t think people will leave right away. There is nothing to do on live except raid log at this point.
---
You play WoW.
---
You should be used to being forced to consume content you don't enjoy.
---
One of my favorite quotes from a guy in battlegrounds, "What's that thing where your pet turns big and red and I die?"
---
Everyone told me to go Marksman but Beast Mastery and Survival were nuts for PVP.
---
This is literally how Counter-Strike became more popular than Quake. The game mechanics allowed players who are less skilled to sometimes get lucky and win. It's pretty well-trodden territory in competitive multiplayer games.

This vid made my day. So spot on. I almost choked at the start when the dude gets dismounted by a mob as he rides away.

Yeah, he said above THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT, IT'S HYPOTHETICAL. Learn to freaking read dude Christ.
---
I meant the mats thing from the perspective of, I don't have to rely on AH prices, time for things to sell on AH or the RNG of drops on a weekly farm. 
---
You have a set farming route for all the mats you need that week. Make the pots, bombs etc and then the rest of what you earn is gravy. 
---
I will certainly look into your tips though! It's much appreciated
---
We still don't know the end cap of concurrent players so it is a bit early to cry for bigger servers. There might wery well and probably be alot bigger then the original server cap. There just aren't enough servers atm to keep server cap at original 3000
---
Or it means there are so many ppl from US/Brazil queueing. You can spin it in both ways.
---
Why not? My question is why? Why is that better? There is going to be plenty of people
---
Clearly made the right decision asking on here before I went through it. Appreciate the honesty boys
---
I assume that wow classic will be getting a parental control feature, like any other blizzard game. You can give your accounts parental controls to a friend and have the friend configure it such that you can't play between e.g. 00:00 - 18:00... you can focus on college during the day and go no-life at wow during the evenings (assuming you can finish your college responsibilities before the evenings).
---
I used to do this as well, it worked really well. During the day I was so bored that I just went studying, whether I felt like it or not.
---
&gt;  little bit of time
---
the only thing I can't never replace. can't ever have more of.
---
that's true Auberdine is good, in general I think the english speaking realms got the worst names
---
&gt; He literally didn't say "no one wants it". 
---
So him "literally" saying "you think you do, but you don't", isn't saying directly to the players face, on live broadcast, "you don't want this".
---
Got it, don't even need to read the rest of your paragraph to know how dense you are.
---
Blood and ashes, that is fast!
---
If it helps, I actually caught a slip by blizzard that confirmed my earlier analogy.  It put the calculation right at 6 hours.
---

That icefrog example is so accurate. He really does a great job at allowing players to discover new metas AMD keeping the game in an ever evolving state.

Light blind you, it’s the Creator that needs praising.
---
i'll suggest rolling on a PvE server and flagging when you want to PvP. you may never pvp this way but that option is there.
---
once you hit 60 and you have a great feeling for the game, roll an alt on the PvP server.
---
If that is the case, then why is blizzard warning us about massive queues at launch via the blue post above?
---
They're clearly taking the approach many players are tourists and won't play long. So to counteract this, they should increase caps. Adding servers would just cause a bunch of dead servers.
---
How has no one mentioned [this](https://youtu.be/HR69zVmPb80)?
---
N=30k isnt a bad sample size
---
*rogue stealth sounds*
---
Gotta be a troll
---
Lets not get  crazy here and bring logic into it.
---
it's monetarily free.  everything cost time.
---
They think everyone will just be a tourist. With that thought process, they should raise server caps opposed to adding more future dead servers
---
Thanks, any word on the Spanish realms?
---
I don’t gank anybody!  But as a shadow priest it is fun to be ganked.  
---
Only times I really attack people would be competition for some resource, or if I see them attacking other players.
---
Light help me, but I’m pulling for him!
---
*cries in Fel Reaver*
---
Cata dungeons were amazing. The problem was that people were used to WotLK faceroll, and they didn't leave enough time for the playerbase to adjust to the new content. In the end they turned Cata into an expansion that made many people give up on WoW for good, although it had so much potential.
---
What realms are the streamers and Brazilians playing on?
---
Did you read the article? The said pop cap stays the same as Vanilla. So instead private-server clusterfuck you will wait in hours-long queue.
---
This is whats above it.  You do realize your making yourself look really stupid right now.  Please take a minute to interpret this again.  He said they will not raise realm cap for layering where the server is currently at.  This cap has nothing to do with when they remove layering.  Its really not complex buddy.  I bet reading a book is really hard for you.
---
"*While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in  2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any  further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising  realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in  at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with  severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of  our content unlock plan.*"
---
You for sure are qualified to say what blizzard should do.
---
Not if I MC and heal the enemy first
---
Maybe you can help me with this. I wanna go warrior and wanna tank for leveling so me and my friends have a group of 5 for doing dungeons. But in late i wanna play fury. When should i start going in on fury in your opinion. Or is there a website where i can look up the best ways?
---
Thalnos has been selected unofficially
---
Not when they think everyone will be a tourist (which they clearly do since they didn't put many servers) with this train of thought, they should add higher caps
---
We are right here buddy, and still saying it.
---
But I am fine with layers of 3k for launch and a 3k cap for Phase Two. I don't want a ghost town, I just don't want the locust swarm zerg you get on pirate funservers with no population limits because that is hugely un-Blizzlike and awful.
---
It's gonna be your first time experiencing wow. You're over thinking things and you should just enjoy the experience of exploring and learning things yourself. You have at least 260 hours of leveling to figure all your questions out before you reach level 60.

To add to that I still eat fast food, buy overpriced t shirts, buy games and the occasional skin on CSGO or EVE. Me not paying for subscription right now is becauase I've never been terribly attached to the name of my character in games. Would it be nice? Sure. Do I understand the hype? Of course I'm super excited about this release. All of my youtube recommend videos are for classic wow and I spend way too much time on this sub and the blizz forum. But is it worth $8? Not to me, but if it's worth it to you then you should go for it! The dude calling people "Sad and broke" is still a bell end, however.
---
To show that once you hit level 50, you aren't even close to 60 yet
---
they want enough people per server that they're not empty after the first month to two months. they dont want the layers and dont expect more than 5-7k per server total.
---
It's not possible, even if you can miraculously get 40 people to hit 60 in 5 days and not sleep.. you are then expecting them to stay up another day and a half farming hydraxian rep and pre raid gear, THEN expecting them to do a FULL clear of MC in 12 hours with the gear they spent 36 hours farming... All the while having been awake 168 hours straight... It's not humanly possible... I don't even think AI could do it and they don't sleep
---
i play rogue and yeah pretty true attack a rogue while u can still see it, and are not dead
---
I think Blizzard has a lot of scientific randomized survey data that we don't and is in a better position to make estimates than we are.
---
But they are doing dynamic respawns (in a way - a bit different... Mob packs always have a living mob, so if you clear an area one mob will always be alive even with a 40 man raid)
---
Same - I'm not trying to get every little thing pre determined and time myself - I'm going to level as quick as I can but know 100% I'll fuck up a ton... good thing is, there is zero reason to rush - we wont see bwl until 2020.
---
Cringey AF
---
Herod **is** cool. That’s why it dwarfs every other server. This isn’t rocket science lol.
---
Honestly I don't get why people are making such a big fuss. People are posting memes and shit because they're excited for classic and can't play it yet, discussion will resume when the game is actually open
---
For NA pvp without a queue roll on stalag
---
Nobody knew because every single post on here linking or sharing the announcement was deleted. Seriously. I saw 4 different ones
---
And 21/0/30 is even perfectly viable for healing raids. And using Divine Favor on command proves you can heal, just unfortunate that you can't get Repentance.
---
I know Orcs get a bonus to axes, but learn every weapon you can so you can use whatever you find that gives the best stats.  I think that means everything except maces.
---
PoE? Pillars of Eternity?
---
Well, i started playing  mmos  when  i was 7. No filters or anything, never had  any  problem. Id go for a low pop pve server
---
I would love this. Insanely good idea.
---
No sarcasm, blizzard is good at identifying afk macros when they are looking for them, and I fully expect them to be looking for it
---
Let the fuckin' man share his wife's badass art with people....fuck!
---
My god... they're learning!  \*insert dramatic music\*
---
yeah, its called raid gear sets.
---
Looks like its from the comments in the database from classic. [Chromie in this instance](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=10667/chromie#comments). Pretty cool to see the actual comments made at the time.
---
I mean, them seeing the massive success of private servers IS listening to the community. The truth of the matter is that forum posts often aren't the best way to gage community sentiment, things like subscriber numbers are more concrete because if people don't like it, they just stop playing. By that logic, the massive numbers private servers were pulling showed them that, yea, there is an audience for this beyond people who take the time to post on the forums.
---
That’s the case.. for now. I think it’s safer than the others by far . But they will most likely release another server
---
Rly amazing video! Thx for sharing!
---
Reminds me of all those retards who thought that pandaren who leveled by picking herbs wasnt botting because he streamed himself doing it every once in awhile.
---
Hahaha nice, that sounds great!
---
I kind of want to experience everything as organically as a hardcore player can. I haven't researched any leveling guides, but I have character guides
---
Only turn it on bosses that have an item reserved. Reserved item should be told when you advertize your group and before you enter the dungeon. If someone throws ML on in the middle of the instance they can go on without their healer.
---
What stat priority for gear while leveling? Beast master, marksman, surv?
---
Ironscape is 99% rng posts, idk what you're talking about.
---
Complete nonsense and fear/doubt/uncertainty. 2 things:
---
 They're tabling on people who made characters on "full" servers just to snipe names and think they'd actually play on it
---
People collectively believe that most people won't quit by the end of the first week.
---
Let’s delete the entire server then. Wait, let’s delete the game so no one will have this problem any more.
---
Absolutely not, I don't know what reading comprehension level you have. They specifically said they're not doing that and gave a hypothetical scenario where they would and the negative of doing so. You should have a cup of tea with the other moron above (wedgies)
---
Don’t understand why you are getting downvoted, your post makes complete sense, you would get locked out of potentially playing with your friends because you didn’t start paying subscription for a game that hasn’t even launched yet. Anyone who makes characters on day 1 of launch should have the option to choose any of the servers they want, no exceptions. Other people downvoting you here fail to see the nuance of the problem
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Brazil is on Thanos, and quite a few streamers have said they're on Faerlina. Though with server population sizes we'll have to see how the cookie crumbles, if these communities break out into other servers blizz (likely) opens up at launch.
---
Higher caps will just lead to higher queues come phase 2. Right now even if 80% of the players on Herod are tourists, you'll probably still have queues come phase 2
---
His name is Robert Paulson.
---
This describes my wife and I exactly. Retail WoW doesn't interest us and hasn't since we quit in Cata, but the hype for classic is, as you say, real.
---
Thank you so much sir!
---
Glad to see the obligatory IKEA uplighter makes an appearance. Great work Josh!
---
Just prepare good food and you're set.
---
You can as a druid lol.
---
A Vega 56, flashed to a Vega 64 bios which only really unlocks the memory frequency and let's you boost a bit higher but I didn't even surpass 25% total system load while also listening to a YouTube video and having dwarf fortress running (cause I'm *that* kind of Linux user)
---
This looks more like Thalnos to me.
---
It looks like you superimposed a piece of a turd over a picture you took of your monitor.
---
Didn't they remove about 80% of the BFD dungeon in retail?
---
I do
---
Lots of ways. This is off the top of my head:
---
* Require previous content for expansion content attunements.
---
* Introduce crafting materials and high-level recipes that still require vanilla content.
---
* Have the catch-up mechanic be raid-specific that makes the one raid easier but doesn't make your character have more gear. An example would be a new weapon enchant that gives +200 attack power in Molten Core
---
* Increase drop rates drastically for older raids so new guilds/players can exhaust that content and move on
---
* Have sort of post-60 progression that makes your character more powerful but still keeps the benefit from the Vanilla raid gear
---
* New Buffs/Spells that make older raids easier
---
* Incentivize veteran players to make PUGs to clear old raids (such as if a rogue wants to get a Thunderfury and reserve the bindings by helping less-skilled people get gear)
---
You are a moron. You don't know how to read. I'm done wasting time with an absolute baffoon who doesn't understand when someone explains why they're not doing something... It means their not doing it.
---
Man I've really been away from retail for a while, what the hell is a void elf? Are there many new races?
---
What's the point of quality if nobody is there to enjoy it
---
But, dat hair casting animation, tho.
---
I doubt even 25% of the people that are going to play bothered to sub 2 months in advance for name reserve. This is going to be a fucking shit show of a launch.
---
i loved long dungeon crawls
---
No, it was the cross realm and auto teleport features.
---
I hadn't even realized the first time I saw the picture. When I read your comment I was sure they were Perdition's Blades until I scrolled back up. Guess I automatically place Perdition's Blades into Bloodfang Rogues in my head.

&gt; most players you see in a battleground are horde players even if they're on the alliance side, as you can opt into something called "mercenary mode" which swaps you to the other faction for the duration of a battleground.
---
I'm genuinely sickened by what's become of retail.
---
You are correct, they are not increasing capacity to introduce more layers as it will increase queue times when they remove layers.  Pretty easy concept right?  :)
---
Why would this be bannable? If I order toast at a restaurant and eat it with a shovel, why should the restaurant care? As long as I'm not shoveling the other guests that is.
---
This is the last time I'm rolling. I've put to many man hours into characters I'll never get back this time I'm going all out one last time.
---
Retail is nothing but RNG it's terrible. Theres no BIS unless you get lucky.
---
I'm honestly so glad I didn't decide to look into it and get drawn in until last week haha idk if I could have lasted 2 years.
---
Delet this fam
---
Ugh same. Was deciding between rogue and priest. And then mage got thrown into the mix. Can't decide!!
---
So this.  I am 44, my son is 13.  He used to move my character around when I wasn't looking.  One time I came back from making a sandwich and somehow found myself dead in a graveyard.  I had drown.  Little stinker was 3 or 4 years old.  Now we are going to Priest/Warrior Duo Level.
---
Because we both work on it together. I helped design the layout, had the initial idea to do these in the first place, and do the research on the classes, and she does the actual art, bringing the idea to reality.
---
Is it so hard to imagine that we both worked on it together, thus why I credited both of us? And, considering I can answer questions far more accurately than her as I actually played classic and did the research in the first place,  that it simply makes sense for me to post it?
---
Go fury from the beginning.  You can tank perfectly fine as any spec as long as you have a shield in your bag to switch to.  Prot isn't at all necessary for most of the game's content.
---
I'd love for her to be in a semi randomised location of something like 8 locations around barrens.
---
Yeah most people had just one level 60 (some never hit 60). You really had a class identity. Those who had more than 1 60 usually focused on one a lot more than the other, it was rare to find someone with multiple 60's, and even fewer had more than 1 geared character.
---
I'll take Warstomp into FD/Trap and Extra HP any day.
---
This is a bizarre gif.
---
People will be planning to do that on both factions, so if you are struggling gankers, you can always call for help in then world chat. With the size of these servers, there's always going to be people who will come and back you up.
---
tell me more about this rogue mage class you speak of.
---
Is his Alliance guide not good? Any better replacement?
---
A good mace spec rogue will stun-lock you into oblivion.
---
&gt; orc warrior and rogue mage
---
I lol'ed, you should be able to do all of the non-class quests just fine. You'll have to go back to Durotar to start yours.
---
My Guild, Horde Gone Wild on Kel'thuzad, dropped Magmadar with 1 tranq back in early 04. Tranq is definitely not a limiting factor in 1.12.
---
i thought you could release, but you couldn't zone through the instance portal
---
I always remember the whole 'don't release' thing
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/GmsPAf9
---
we did do priest already! All thats left is warlock, druid and mage (isnt that crazy?? only 10 days till classic!)
---
I mean...what kind of weenies really care about the server name.  They should have just called them pvp-east-1, pvp-east-2, etc.  I really don't need a server given a "realm" name to create some sense of immersion.
---
That there were quests outside of Elwynn Forest. I just grinded to 15 and queued dungeons for the rest of my life.
---
And thank God, because i'm in my 4th depressed era and really needed a distraction.
---
Too little too late. LFG meant people would just quit after first wipe and regroup later on. No motivation to try or to be good. Who cares? Gonna end up with randoms few minutes later anyway.
---
 Sharding and LFG killed wow world.
---
I haven’t drank in like 10 weeks. My original launch day would be a fat case of beer, some white, and unlimited junk food..

Now I’ll be sticking to Bubbly, and I bought a weeks supply of meal prep food haha.. this health kick is a pain

Mine got removed :(
---
Doesn't matter you can do both if you know where to go in tanaris to change from one to the other  and still be able to use all the shit you made

yeah I am excited to get started. I do plan to just go with it but I like some guidance or something to fall back on when I want to make progress.

"And a Bronze Dragon named Chromie" fit well

And another Ret in pic 9!
---
I got my Hunter to 10 in 2hr 10m with a tiny amount of practice. I am happy with it
---
maybe they wanted to wait till after name reservations to dedicated players got their names first
---
It is really when you realize its not a random sampling. Its a very specific minority of a minority. Not good.
---
Horde or pussy?
---
i still meet max-level druids in dungeons every so often unaware that they even have a battle res
---
Is there something wrong with that?
---
You'll be wishing you had that again once classic drops.
---
Ill be leveling too hard to do it drunk. Retail sure lol its just flashing lights like whack a mole.
---
Chills.
---
now that is funny shit
---
Those things definitely aren't worth that much particularly early on when nobody has gold yet
---
The queue goes much faster without a character to create.  The 10k 1h queue you saw during name reservation was just that.  People sitting in the name reservation screen.   There are only a fixed number that can be doing that at once.  
---
Logging in and selecting a character is much faster.  
---
It's *absolutely absurd* to think blizzard's login is so slow as to only do 3 logins a second from character select to in game.  (3600 seconds an hour * 3 &gt; 10k ).   Expect a 10k queue to go by in 10 minutes at most.  Right up until the server is full.  Then you are waiting for people to log off.  But with layering they can just pile more and more people on.  You can have 100k people with layering online across 1000 instances of the newbie zones.
---
Chill

I don't think you understand how sample sizes work when it comes to statistics.

3 points in thick hide instead of endurance, it’s way better for your pets survivability if you still want to farm stuff. 
---
Trueshot aura is way too good not to take if you want your build to be viable for raiding
---
Imp concussive isn’t that worth it imo. Efficiency is necessary for PvE and even better than imp concussive in long pvp fights as well. I’d go 5/5 efficiency and put the 2 pts from imp hunters mark into imp concussive
---
what about potato?
---
not saying you have to heal, but have fun with your wand in raids ):

Thanks for the thanks! I love when an expert can give people more in depth answers, these definetly were made to be very simple, so its nice seeing someone more knowledgeable about the class pipe in with some helpful info!

No this is just wrong
---
If you read the post, he never said there would be additional que times in phase 2... The only way that would happen is if population cap was reduced. How else?
---
On Amazon these guides are selling for more than they did during Vanilla. $70-$90 for a new one
---
Spotify has all the soundtracks... And YouTube. I'm assuming your PC can run both at the same time.
---
Literally the most boring way to play classic imo
---
Jeez the playerbase is over a decade older, let's try to have some nuance
---

---
You can’t compare classic prices to twink prices now. In early classic no one will have 3k for a green or blue. Maybe in a year or so.
---
Nah it wasn't worth nearly as much in vanilla because there was no transmogging.

"Wow this is so good ! :D You look so fierce and badass :D I love your smile! :)"
---
Nice thinking. I was planning priest main/hunter alt, which sounds about right. Priest hardly sucks but it’s definitely more faff than a hunter, and the hunter can feed gold to my main later on.
---
No it's not, another idiot on the list. Let's hear the braindead explanation from another moron
---
I haven't experienced it, but I see a lot of people complaining about them in other games.  So I pass it on for people who care.
---
I do wonder if the same goes for Shazzrah and Golemagg on EU at this point since they are also "Full".
---
They'll remember, they wont have the money!

I believe that's an Ikea shelving unit of some sort, not a freezer.

---
classic stress test had two seperate binds, "target enemy player" and "target enemy".
---
target enemy player should exclude pets, at least thats how it works on retail
---
Why would you want to avoid it?
---
Laughs in Zandalar Tribe
---
Haha, sweet. Good luck and all the best to goals!
---
Here's a thought. Don't charge your player base such extremely amounts to move a toon or toons from servers. It's a dick move and will ultimately destroy low pop servers after the boom.
---
Ok disagree with no rebuttal. Typical moron
---
There's a ton of YouTube videos for beginners that would suit you better than anything you'll get on reddit.
---
I chuckle when people say that a downside of a druid is that you don't see gear as often
---
Yeah, because you can xform INTO A SILLY BEAR
---
And you seem to think the people that "sniped" names is a massive majority.
---
You also think, based on practically nothing, that most people will quit a week in. Just baseless assumptions.
---
I will primarily focus on PvP. How is PvP gear?

You are literally proving my point and choosing to not see it. As I said previously, if Blizzard released more servers at character reservation this wouldn't be a problem. You have disagreed on that while at the same time trying to tell me Herod is so full because it's so cool. I don't know how you could possibly think that but not see the solution is to have more "cool" servers to compete for players. Now THAT'S not rocket science.
---
Imagine how different the population on Herod would be if instead of 
---
Thanos
---
Fairbanks
---
As the only pvp east coast options you also could choose 
---
Hogger
---
C'thun
---
You literally are trying to tell me that Herod is just SO COOL of a name that it completely eclipses any possible server competition and no matter what it would be overflown with players. That's not true.  There would be a fuckload of people that would pick Hogger/C'thun over Herod. Maybe you, maybe not. Everyone has different ideas of cool.
---

---
What about this guy (chances are there are hundreds if not thousands like him on Herod) Is he just trying to join the 'cool' server. Nah there is just 30k people on Herod and he knows people playing on there. What a shocker! That's how numbers work. Population growth is exponential.
---
February 04 to March 05 here. So missed out on WoW launch, but then I went back to Germany and didn't come back to the states until July, started towards the end of the month.
---
like when in vanilla, the pvp players (who didn't want to raid) cried about raid gear being to strong.
---
and so blizzard ruined pve progression, by forcing higher ilvl gear to flood the game every 3 months, "for parity" due to... 
---
pvp players also crying... that there was no reason to stay subscribed (because they were ignoring most of the content)... so blizzard gave them a seasonal carrot on a stick, hamster wheel, whatever you wanna call it.. seasonal gear upgrades... 
---
and that crap bled into pve and ruined the experience, memories, etc.
---
ruined.
---
you should still sell that training sword of the boar though
---
Nope. I kept it simple.
---
Just a window that have text on it.
---
With a couple of buttons to move/scale the window and change next/prev to navigate the guide.
---
They should also tell you a time ahead of time when its opening...so people can get name reserves
---
Joana is not the gold standard of power leveling. Expect a lot of people to reach 60 faster than that.
---
&gt;Still got my names because they weren't some stupid pun or internet meme
---
This is where having another interest (like listening to shitloads of metal so I have an encyclopedic knowledge of [cool band names](https://i.imgur.com/ayBWGaM.png)) comes in handy.
---
Come on, you can suck harder than that. At least make your main a ret paladin and refuse to heal because you don't want to spend gold on respeccing!
---
This is it exactly. Imagine queueing for upto several hours every day to get the same experience as someone on a medium server without queues.
---
After only ever playing horde toons, and being a die-hard horde player, my guild is deciding to move to ally for classic?? So... unfortunately, pussy. Lok'tar ogar
---
Had they continued developing WoW with some more of the original passion, there would be no need for classic. I'm also a little skeptical about the long term motivation to play it (&gt;1-2 years), but we'll see what the future brings, for now it's the best we have.
---
Haha I like it! It’s gonna be epic
---
Yeah hunter or lock alt is great. Wuick to level and farm with
---
Thanks dude, it's clearly the best option on their current track. Why they're not doing it is stupid, since adding more tourist servers will be dead in 2 months
---
I guess that's true haha. We're talking about demographics here, there are always outliers lol.
---
You won't get anywhere near those prices for a long time. BG's aren't released in phase one so no one will be twinking.
---
The real PSA is if you plan on twinking later look out for your items now as you can get them for cheap.
---
It better still work for horde. I don't like how it says "alliance quest"
---
though from blizzards perspective, if later on they think letting people move makes more money they'll do that
---
they won't be like 'sucks, we told you so' if it actually hurts the game
---
yeah my bad , edited xD
---
I have used the same name on private servers for many years. It has become so recognizable to some people that when they see someone ingame with the same or similar name they hit me up on discord to check if that was me.  
---
It is based on a minor fictional character so no wonder others might pick it as well but it is my name just as much, the people I roll with recognise that name too.  
---
Vanilla wow is more about your community and your reputation than you might think. My name has left a strong legacy across private servers,  I will do my best to continue it in classic.
---
There are 8 new races that came with the latest expansion, BFA.

---
This gave me goosebumps.
---
But then I remembered... I’m playing on Herod, and I’ll never get to play.
---
I wouldn't take it that far ;)
---
Don't try it. You are talking to one of the many walls in this sub that will always be negative about this subject and not see reason.
---
almost all the servers are going to have long queue times, it doesn't matter which you picked.
---
No problem! And I definitely wouldn’t say I’m an expert but I know a few things lol I just love the community and want to help people out as much as I can with the info I do have. Hope to see you in game!

On a PVP server, engineery is a must to every class

it might be using your onboard graphics, rather than your dedicated gpu.

Some of the worst, most report-worthy shit, in my opinion, will not be caught by the profanity filter. In fact, I do not care about profanity, myself.
---
But if I see raw, targeted bigotry or bullying, I'll be reporting it. Plain and simple, the state of discourse online is way worse now that it was in 2004. People are way bigger pieces of shit, and in greater numbers, and treat a lot of their bigotry and abusive ways as almost sacred. To those people, a big middle finger and a report. People just being idiots? Sure, I'll ignore.
---
kinda low effort since this idea has already been posted multiple times (albeit with slightly different images)

my vega has worked just as well as my RX480s did, which worked as well as my ancient 6850s. i actually refuse to touch nvidia anything because AMD has always had the best performance and most reliability

i dont play super AAA games, and people who use linux and also game should be happy that anyone gives a shit about games on linux at all. i may not be terribly invested in steam but i worship gaben for his decision, even if it was only to spite microsoft. 
---
DXVK, Vulkan, Proton, and Lutris are a new paradigm and things can only get better from here. i've noticed explicit performance increases after just about every other update i receive for the DXVK/Vulkan software, and tbh i predict it'll take about 5 more years for linux to become totally equal to windows in the gaming department at which point i suspect some big mainstream companies will catch wind and start supporting it too. 
---
we may be on track for total ~~world~~ desktop domination, comrade.
---
Cheeky little bastard aren't you lol. I can respect that I guess.
---
"Squeal of fortune"?  Quick! Grab the... greased pig?
---
The most important thing you'll need is a sense of direction as to which areas to level in next. 
---
I recommend checking out Joana's leveling guide (he's currently the record holder for fastest first to 60 and he got that record in 2006 and no one has beat it yet). He made a website that tells you the most efficient path to take based on your race and class you choose. I recommend checking it out so you know the zones you should be in, but I wouldn't follow it step by step because it'll ruin all sense of fun and exploration for you.
---
Lol that’s J Allen Brack. AKA current president of Blizzard Entertainment and was Executive Producer and Vice President of World of Warcraft when he said that. 
---
Honestly I think he just got caught up in how the game was going and forgot how good the non convenient parts of the game were. I think he’s smart and didn’t take the time to think about the perspective of how good the old game was since he’s basically been in charge of improving it since then. 
---
Once he saw how much we adored Classic, I think he came around to being fond of it like we are. That’s my optimistic point of view and I believe it.
---
It does reveal rogues who walk into it, but the only time I would recommend doing so is when you know you’re going to need to be in one place such as if you’re capping a flag in arathu basin or something. 
---
If you’re quick you can drop it mid fight on rogues who try to re-enter stealth, robbing them of a second opener on you. This will often be the difference between life and death if you get jumped.
---
This is completely wrong. Its hard to explain how wrong because all of it is wrong.
---
:Yawn: 
---
Tell me more about how i should play a video game.
---
lOr just let people plan on switching servers. Totally agree.
---
This is pretty good for a leveling spec, I'd say drop two points from RWS and toss in Spirit Bond, it'll help keep you topped off while grinding and may keep you alive in PvP, you're not gonna miss 2% damage. Also, scrap something for Beastial Swiftness, it makes your pets always able to stick to your target.
---
Same I'd rather pay not to play retail
---
tbh if you're doing it relative to ALL specs in the game they should all be ~'s or even negative, since rogue is one of the slower levelers regardless of spec
---
I liked achievements but I don’t enjoy seeing “&lt;LINK X ACHIEVEMENT&gt; for invite.
---
They have to. If you have 3 layers with 3,500 players each... that's 10,500 players. Once those layers are removed you are back down to a 3,500 cap.
---
I remember running WoW on super low graphics on my like 2006 dell inspiron (intel integrated graphics). 
---
Got me by for downtime at college/work.
---
Sheesh, I really am basically you. I played a shockadin in TBC because I wasn't happy being just a healer, damnit. I might've been the only non-tank paladin that used consecration but damnit I'm using every source of damage i can get!
---
"why did I get kicked from guild?"
---
"You kept yelling in all caps to right click. I learned three new curse words from your rant."
---
I literally had a macro that said that every time I used a stun.
---
They usually resisted it :*(
---
hahah trust me im no fan of playing retail, but with how easy they made it, i can farm up a months worth of gametime in like a few hours of playing, or with some lucky/smart auctioning its all passive! then play the real game for free*!
---
they d actually have to pay me to play that dogshit not the opposite lol
---
why is this fairbanks exactly? lol
---
Blizz have been adding allied races. They are mostly reskins of existing races with new racials and lore. They require exalted with their respective faction to unlock
---
Not really. DMG output without CDs is way higher being MM. You can global someone with Aimed+Multishot crits
---
IMO it gets smaller as you reach the end again, the last day feels short af since you know it's coming.
---
gearscore simply doesn't work in culture of vanilla/classic.  
---
Itemization is "bad" and stats are not "balanced" - there are many over-statted items despite being lower level or item level.
---
Daggers and Swords and Axes are your best friends. Daggers often give agi since they're mostly a Rogue weapon, swords and axes often give attack power. Agi&gt;&gt;Stam&gt;Int

You can usually find it on the auction house if you *need* it. I would only recommend getting it though for guild raids, I remember selling it for a healthy profit 15 years ago :P
---
i meant at a later date as in 'next tuesday well open up name reservations' (not sure if that was /s)
---
Kill, or dont its whatever
---
I really hope so! I’ll look into it when the servers are up. Hopefully be able to run something.
---
Cool, thanks for the rundown man! Those trolls look insanely buff and powerful compared to the old lanky fellas. They certainly have their charm though!
---
The population cap before you start getting queues will be much higher on day 1 than phase 2.  Layering is the tool they are using to handle the increased population until all the tourists leave.
---
Jesus, retail fan much? 
---
I was going to respond , but judging from your posts why bother, your firmly entrenched in the "everyone things they want this but they don't" camp.

I stopped playing for a bit and wanted to get back in but seeing what the current game was I realized I didn't want to play that game anymore. Now that classic is back I'm actually looking into buying a PC strictly for the game... I have an outdated iMac and classic is the only thing in the last 9yrs that's made me think of spending a couple hundred on a PC.
---
I know one of the groups going for world firsts (MC clear, first 60s, etc) and if you're starting with a public leveling guide you already lost. I think they are planning on week 2 clear, but I also doubt they will be the best prepared group going for it...
---
I'd pay stupid $$$ for new content in the 60 state of 40 man raiding for an alternate wow not moving into TBC
---
Bilbo Baggins style, he always reminded me of a hobbit
---
Lolwut. Layers temporarily increase the population caps to allow for more players (that eventually leave). Theoretically once you’re at the cap it doesn’t do anything, but that number is much higher with layering than without.
---
Okay me too.. Not gonna lie lol
---
check his post history, it's pretty clear which side of the fence he's on.  He does not want Classic WoW and so he's here to tell us we don't either.
---
This. We raided just fine as a NA guild playing on private servers. 130 ping was the best you got and spiking to 500 ping wasn't too uncommon. 
---
Sticking to a steady 70ms? I wouldn't worry.
---
We don’t know. Herod is an obviously seemingly safe bet long term due to sheer volume. But stalag is looking pretty nice. They both will prolly be just fine
---
Herod already has the population so the odds are in its favor. There isn’t really anything else we can use to predict.
---
already checked, thanks tho
---
His Alliance guide was fine, but keep in mind he looks like he is porting the guide from a PDF to a website, which was not previously available. I just think he is not done with it yet. I would imagine based on what he is saying that it will be done by launch.
---
Nah, I think you really can't argue for the validity of anything that's for free on the internet.
---
And as soon as only a single penny is involved the numbers drop tremendously.
---
'tis a whole different game now with money involved. That shows that there is some weight behind your intentions.
---
I can try anything for free and be like "whatever" but as soon as ya want me coins...!
---
If you want a guarantee, go herod but I'm going Stalagg because I'd rather now be in 10k+ queues.
---
Holy fuck I'm so pumped!!!
---
* Herod and Stalagg will most likely have high populations at launch. However, Herod will have "severe" queues as blizzard said. And if the population doesn't budge by the time layers are removed those queues will continue well past phase 2. 
---
* After layers are removed all the realms will have the same population cap. So assuming realms are able to reach this cap,you are not really getting a better experience with Herod... just longer potential queues... potentially much much longer.
---
Server mergers look bad.
---
Is Bender a lefty?
---
Im more thinking end game spec that's why I didn't spec in frenzy and beastial wrath like other leveling specs
---
Are there anything else to scrap if I don't want to respec at 60?
---
True lol.  But don't be afraid to play on a medium or low pop server.  According to a blue post, they can fit so many more people into a server today, that they raised the population threshold by a huge amount.  So much that a server with medium pop still has way more people than the "full" servers did in 2006
---
I'm pretty set on playing on the eastcoast servers. Still though, I am slightly considering whether or not I should roll on Whitemane.. I actually have no reason to be set on an eastcoast server, only reason is that im on the eastcoast. Do east/west coast servers really make a difference? I'm not really versed on this, so any information helps. thanks!
---
What changed? They've had classic addons for months, but there still doesn't seem to be any separate category for it.
---
This is all just fear mongering to get people to move
---
That hasn't stopped people from using it as the be all end all on retail since it's introduction. It's why equiped ilvl and bag ilvl became a thing, because idiots used it as the be all end all even though many specs had bis items at a lower ilvl than the current raid, specially trinkets. Some of those same idiots will be playing classic, so I'll gladly give up the armory if it means not having to deal with them.
---
Doesn't matter. Most people will still do it.
---
Bunch of masochists!
---
thats part of the mankrik joke, people mispelling it in barrens chat all the time
---
Actually I'd say the talents will help a ton, for some classes the talent revamps really improved the leveling process.
---
What you on about, crooked teeth get fixed by HEALTHCARE!! we just don't have them white cause we don't need to be fake to be interesting.
---
Eh theres multiple ways to skip STV. Classic always has bleed-off zones if any one particular area is shit. I plan to hang out in Feralas-Thousand Needles-Tanaris core area for a long while. STV won't be worth the hassle with my limited time scales.
---
Mind you, this is purely a sample of about 900 people for Pyrewood Village (PvE) only.
---
:Alliance:  61%
---
:Horde:  39%
---
:Warrior:  16.9%
---
:Druid:  8.0%
---
:Shaman:  6.5% 
---

---

---
It would! Thanks :)
---
I really like that!
---
Wht hve u done pzzashll?
---
Honestly once the streamers quit their followers will go also. They may have a temporarily higher pop but the drama will kill people's desires to stick with them.
---
Looks like you're right but aren't the pouches those permanent booze slushies for underage girls?
---
So main Paladin and alt a hunter? Check
---
Shut up
---
Hah. In vanilla the only time I broke 1k gold was for a few minutes between auctioning a krol blade I had luckily found, and buying my epic mount
---
but STV is the best zone
---
I was testing the ElvUI dev release and it's pretty stable.
---
Which is faster, 60 in wow or 99 runecraft
---
&gt; and like a slot machine, there's no skill involved.
---
Not if you want the best stuff.
---
The ones that have "severe" queue warnings from blizzard.
---
Anyone cheaping out over half a month of sub fare isn't going to play the game for long any way tbh.
---
I can’t tell if this is creative, depraved, or a copy pasta.
---
melee
---
And this is all speculation.
---
I read that post. But your post says something completely different than blizzard. If your intention was to education the community about the post then you should probably have posted what blizzard said. Your re imagining of their words changes the meaning completely.
---
something near gold cap i would say
---
I leveled a rogue to 60 in vanilla and it took me about 4 months playing everyday with 17.5 days /played. I PvP'd a lot and did a bunch of random stuff around the world just to take it all in. I guess I got the typical Vanilla experience. It was great.
---
I think people are vastly underestimating the time it will take them to hit 60. If you haven't played since Vanilla, haven't looked at guides AND gone through practice runs, it's going to take you a while. I don't care how long you've played retail....I think most people are going to be in for a rude awakening once they hit level 40 or so. People look at the world record and think it will take them maybe double that....just no. Plan on 250 hours or more at the very least if you are completely new to vanilla.
---
what do you mean ? only 10 levels left
---
Calling it now, at least 2 guilds will be able to it, one of them probably APES. 
---
!RemindMe 3 weeks
---
Wait until you finish the starting zone, then you can quest together wherever, Warrior and mage have trainers around Brill and Razor Hill so either orc or undead 2nd area is fine.
---
Because one of the great things about Vanilla you got to know the people on your server if servers start being 20k people the community aspect is ruined.
---
If someone didn't read the blue post thoroughly, it would seem to be you.
---
You are safer on the roads they said...
---
&gt; Agreed, how out of touch do you have to be to believe that players don't want to form groups themselves?
---
Very in touch? How hard it was to get groups was one of the most common complaints and the reason most people simply didn't bother ever doing dungeons.
---
Instant queue probably went too far in the other direction, but it certainly wasn't created without good reason.
---
Oomkin

Something he mentions a bit that I hadn't realized was that Edgemasters Handguards don't work with two hand weapon skills.  I had previously thought that they'd be important for 2H Fury as well but I guess not.
---
Didn't Blizzard offer him a job after the Naxxramas trailer?  Black Temple was supposed to be next but it never happened...probably because he's making bank now.
---
You are already logged in once you have retrieved the realm list, so that’s not it. There’s even a login queue if too many players attempt to connect at the same time.
---
I guess you have a point about slowly letting more and more people in.
---
I wouldn't know, I think I leveled up maybe 2 characters after Cata, which was generally decked in heirloom gear en steamrolled through the content without any immersion whatsoever. Can't even remember.
---
You might be confusing the EU with the UK my friend
---
The mace was thorn-stone sledgehammer probably if for lvl 38s, my buddy gave me one at lvl 5 to try to motivate me to lvl back in classic, instead i quit at lvl 28
---
It doesn't say that. The whole point of layering is to temporarily increase the population cap for launch.
---
You think you want 30k players running around per server, but you don't.
---
God. It would be game over for me if I could be a cow rogue. I'd have one on every server.
---
Stalag will easily get to full before launch and then the rest of the playerbase will also pick servers at launch. So it is also gonna have a queue
---
Nah it's fine. Just get ready for your classic experience.
---
Ah okay thanks, guess windows is the way to go then. I just found it weird that the GPU can be supported on one OS but not the other lol
---
I'm really not sure what I want to do here. On one hand, on a high pop server, you have a much better AH economy and plenty of people to grouo with for things. But on a lower pop server, people are more well known and the things you do seem to carry more weight. You tend to find tighter knit groups of people and will definately see the same people while leveling up and doing the same kind of things at endgame.
---
I back in late BC I play on Boulderfist, which was a pretty low population server, with like 70% of the people on Horde, and I was alliance. Then I switched to Lightbringer, which was higher pop and Ally heavy. The difference in how the communities behaved was night and day. Fame and infamy is a whole other aspect of the game on a low pop realm in comparison. At least from what I've seen.
---
Some will, some won’t. It’s not like every person playing classic has already played it or is going to fall in love with it.  Some people will quit and some will quit quick. The drop off may not be as steep as blizzard is anticipating but there will be a drop off.

---
Look for Lan
---
\&gt; I think Blizzard has a lot of scientific randomized survey data  
---
While this is true, the question that poses itself here (how many people will return to wow classic, how many will switch from retail) is a novel one. This is a situation that lends itself to data misinterpretation and false confidence.
---
I think it was a mistake to have 3 character slots on day 1.  
---
This means that the lucky first gets to name their alts before other people get to name their mains.  
---
I'd be annoyed if someone put my main name on a alt and never played it.
---
Rogues do 100% threat and have feint. 
---
Warriors in zerker stance do 80% threat. 
---
A good tank should only ever have threat issues in the first 20 seconds of the fight and with the new info on fury tanking that should no longer be a thing. 
---
No class at any point should have threat issues if your tank is adequately geared, potted, buffed and skilled
---
tl;dr - "Reading is hard!"
---
Troll for premade PvP, UD for solo and world PvP.
---
In premade any CC should be dispelled very fast, for world PvP the UD just offers more with WOTF and Cannabalize.
---
Why there are not storage requirements for macOS?
---
I have 128 GB version and 70 is taken by the system. I have 10GB free, is it enough? Can someone tell me whtehr this will be enough?
---
no offense but you really don't; private servers and true vanilla are different and level 28 is so, so far from 60 
---
this isn't to say that you won't stick it out, but tons of people will fall by the wayside or else blizzard would never have planned for layering in the first place
---
lol it was on that boss then moved to the king :(
---
60 in WoW is a lot faster than 99 Runecrafting in OSRS. Unsure about RS3.
---
Pros of rolling warrior:
---
Gonna kill a lot of people
---
Cons of rolling warrior:
---
Gonna get killed by a lot of people
---
Yep. Fucking ruined immersion. All the instant travels did.
---
"an alt" - hahahhah
---
Nope, as far as I remember, if you logged into your friends character, u had his keybinds!
---
But many players clicked a lot in classic.. overall keybinding got really  popular quite late.
---
Unless you get Viskag it’s the best MH sword for Rogues until CTS from Chromaggus.

Me and creepy uncle are going to have fun on the 26th.

If you think critics are what stops a sequel from being made, you're living in a different world than the rest of us.

If it made enough money, there would be a sequel.

Camme back to wow after leaving in wotlk and play retail just to pass time. Half of guild reserved names but have no intention in sticking with classic
---
Definitely dude. I get off work at 11:30pm at the earliest. This is perfect for me, tbh. A booming economy that I can take full advantage of? Sign me up.
---
Here's a quick attempt I made. [Link](https://imgur.com/9fes9np)
---
The worst are pictures of a collection of shitty packaged snacks(chips, candy, soda, etc) on the couch with some cutsie note saying "enjoy your video game honey! I love you! xoxo" written by their totally real girlfriend, complete with some generic cringy title like "Been working hard at my new part time job and suffering depression, came home to this".
---
It's fake, it's cringy, and it's irrelevant low tier content. I hate those posts so much.
---
Try 3 months now. Every major patch that brings a new raid tier completely invalidates the old tiers and they give make up mechanics so that you can completely skip tiers of content.
---
I have seen people on retail throw legit fits about their pixels being misgendered, and threatening to open tickets to GMs. Not the player. Their toon. So, forgive me if I think it needs to be stated.
---
Also, discourse hasn't really changed much, people's attitudes to it is what really has. Not weighing in on the positive or negative of that, just that I've been using the internet for going on 22ish years and besides people's reactions, the content of whats said and how has pretty much remained a constant.

10 million+
---
I was the second richest person I knew at the end of vanilla at ~6k gold(there were plenty of richer people than that, I just didn't know them :P).  I quit BfA ~3-4 months after it launched with ~1.3 million gold, nearly all of it made during the xpac(I think I was around 60k when it launched).  I can safely say that the 6k gold I had in Classic required far more effort(10x the effort easy) to attain than the 1.3 million in BfA.  
---
60k back than is actually insane money.

The group finder that came at the tail's end of TBC was perfect. It was literally just automatic /2 spam without the actual /2 spam. It didn't teleport you, it wasn't cross-realm, it didn't replace having a guild or friends or any of that nonsense.

---
So you predict in 6 months it’ll be double the size of BFA?
---
It's better than phasing imo because layering covers the whole world, not just one zone. So you can't walk next to someone and then watch him fade away as you enter Loch Modan, which is better for immersion.
---
ok, thx :)
---
They’ve already confirmed that cross-realm bgs will be in it.
---
On nost they released an infographic saying 10days and change was average to 60 time. That's with like hundreds of thousands of accounts wisely ranging in experience.
---
Uhhg. How dumb do you have to be to not have enjoyed watching that movie? How good the movie was doesn't matter it was soo god damned cool seeing wow on screen.
---
I hope they do a shit load of meth and decide it's financially sound to make another.
---
Yes, but each of those levels take much higher amounts of time and experience to level through.
---
Did you turn off your brain before you read the bit about harassment should be reported?
---
Nope. A lot of us did this shit as 14 year olds with dial up and year 2005 information. You’ll be fine.
---
What a daring statement.
---
Remove the BFA one and you have my ideal version
---
You are a disgrace for the Horde. The original one, the old one, the new one, the iron one, the modern one, the genocidal-blight one and all the futures Hordes. Consider yourself dismissed.
---
Might go with one! The more I've been thinking about it the more I like the idea of a gnome warlock.
---
What if they share accounts though? And there is no need for everyone to have the essence, you only need, like, 7 or something?
---
I do doubt they are going to make it in week 1, I think the requirements (consumables, gear) are too high. And it's completely nuts and would take my fun away if I were to do it personally, but some people are crazy when it comes to world firsts.
---
Cross-realm Battlegrounds were added in patch 1.12 and are confirmed for Classic as enabled from the start.
---
thank you for sharing your opinion with us
---
With that level of gear you should be seal fate/blade flurry. You’d be crit capped with buffs and pots and with the 5 pc 2.5 gear your evis damage would be bonkers.
---
Pathetic
---
I used Joanas guide.  It was a hunter at like 4 days 23 hours.  I also was using a lot of rested XP over many play sessions, it was not done in a speed-leveling context.
---
Honestly skip staves. The only staff geared towards hunters in Lohk'delar, and it isn't even that good compared to other available weapons at that "tier".
---
Can the English speak German?
---
Why do you think you deserve to have those glorious names?
---
Dont be afraid to add more servers just because their not all completely full yet 10 days before launch...
---
You think you do but you don't.
---
The smithson-boeregardè regression model statistical calculations have been repeated numerous times and suggest the answer to your question is Herod. 
---
Tldr : boobies
---
And also casually mentioning your product in social media discussions unrelated to your product. GWENDOLYN.
---
&gt; no death penalty?
---
Yeah...I am pretty sure that if the then-"standard" death penalty had existed, I would have spent much of 2005 naked, gearless, and at level -1.
---
Oh damn
---
Amen, fellow PvE bro!
---
Yes it should, still can’t convince myself that Thunderbluff and Darnassus are major cities as they’re always dead lol
---
My biggest gripe with it was when it included cross realm people. Thats when the community died a little extra.
---
Right? I was in the staff room at work crying not to tear up and hoping nobody would walk in, in case I did lol.
---
Cata was actually the most fun I had playing the game,  that’s where wow peaked for me, but I also started in wrath. Excited to see what the game was like in the before time, in the long long ago.
---
I’d add people all the time in dungeons. But by the next day they’d be 40 levels above me (or me above them) and we’d never play again.
---
Yes for raiding trueshot is insane. It’s one of the best value talents in the game. 100 AP to warriors/rogues is p big :)
---
This guy is projecting hard. Hope you're ok mate. And for the record I am British, not American.
---
Because summons
---
I did, you still have not read the blue post thoroughly as proven by your answer.
---
Read what beardruid12 wrote, it's the same answer you'd get from me.
---
Goosebumps
---
Are you talking about the passage under the throne room? It's not there in vanilla, I checked last test.
---
Ah yes. Tab targeting. We got a future extra add puller boys.
---
quite possibly but then I'll be to discouraged to log out at all.

SHED THE WEAK!!

If you don't have any ties to the server (friends, guild), do it.
---
Thats really evil, mine doesnt wants to play anything pcgames related at all :( Going to lvl warrior alone...
---
It's too early in the morning for this much profundity. Take my damn upvote.
---
20/0/31 cause im selfish
---
Launch day a Large pizza and ill get half it down and eat the other half cold so I don't have to leave my computer! Then healthy meal prep for the next week.
---
That and 30 isn't halfway there. You're not even quarter way there.
---
Got a shipment of club mate coming in, wont need much else
---
But you dont know by how much, or when, and we're talking about layering being gone in phase 2. There's just as much likelihood that phase 2 will have dreadful login queue times on some servers.
---
It doesn't matter if the servers new hardware can handle even a million players. The game world itself was built for an expected 2500 max back in 2006. If the server has even half the 10k remaining, that's still double what the original vanilla game world ever saw at peak. Login queues wouldn't be added because of server stress, because the servers can handle it. They'd be added because the zones can't handle so many people without layering. Gameplay would suffer with so many people everywhere.
---
It's better to assume classic will be very popular, and the drop-off won't be as high as people think. It's better now for the population to spread out more across the servers, just like Blizzard is warning.
---
True af ^
---
You realize these are all transmog prices heavily inflated over nearly 15 years?
---
Nobody is going to have 56k for a very long time, let alone for a cosmetic item.
---
the farm spot next to Moonglade demands this code be forgotten.
---
&gt; most of the tourists will be gone by then.
---
That is the presumption Blizzard is betting on. However...
---
* High pop vanilla servers didn't lose population
---
* Nost stayed high population
---
* Light's hope stayed high population
---
So I'm not sure I'm convinced of this tourist phenomenon. If it doesn't decline sufficiently the queues will be pretty bad for a lot of servers... and especially Herod... in Phase 2.
---
More details on this spec ??
---
Dude what are these prices. This is Classic wow sub, not BFA. Sure hand of Edward and Teebus are priced somewhat accurately, but 3000g for a green chest piece? In vanilla? not going to happen.
---
Now there is. I don't know when my Twitch app updated, but now when I point the installation to ...\\\_classic_\ it only shows me addons with a Classic designation. Very happy Curse got this out in time for launch, I had 7 addons that had updates since the last day of the recent stress test. Now if only Tukui would update their client to also install Classic-only updates!
---
They said in an interview it was. But it certainly a bit of both. Good games designer usually design alot of things around technical limitations. Respawn times, zones sizes, etc... All of this was tuned with a 3k player cap in mind.
---
even if the 40+ characters intending to clear MC stay awake, or share their accounts the whole week... its still 99.999% impossible to get raid ready in time, even the most hardcore raiding guild on Silver Hand only cleared rag week 3, and they were alliance too (cheese mag)  
---
and anyone thats still on the mindset that "joanas speed is outdated and that ALLOT of people will outpace him" I urge you to go look at the "realm best" for each class on Silver Hand (Light's Hope) discord ch under the achievement tab   
---
\-mage 2 days 17 hours 17 mins (prob world friggen record, the guy was INSANE) but they nerfed AoE grind in classic vs vanilla/private so not viable  
---
\-hunter didnt log, im assuming it was between 3days and 5 days  
---
\-warrior 5 days 17 hours  
---
\-warlock 7 days 1 hour  
---
\-rogue 7 days 1 hour  
---
\-priest 9 days 10 hours  
---
\-shaman 6 days 19 hours  
---
\-druid 5 days 1 hour  
---
\-paladin 8 days 7 hours  
---
ALL TIMES IN /played, not Xdays from server release... NONE of these guys stayed on 24/7
---
First UBRS clear 11 days into launch  
---
First Devilsaur kill 6 days in  
---
First onyxia clear 15 days (without attunement) first attunement was 17 days in  
---
First ragnaros clear - 17 days in (third week)  
---
Im not saying private is exactly proportionate to classic when it goes live... but expect simmilar timeframes (the times above were all nolifed, the guild that killed all those bosses was aiming to down KT within 2 months of the server going live so they were rushing this just asmuch as anyone will be come live.
---
Endgame, for blue gear you'll be wanting either the one handed axe from Stratholme Baron, the Ice Barbed Spear from Alterac Valley (Unlikely though since you'll probably take the crossbow instead), or the two handed sword from Dire Maul tribute runs.
---
Pretty sure most raid melee weapons for hunter are axes. Dual-wielding is preferred in PvE as the bonus from two agility enchants outweighed enchants on a 2hander of the same item level.
---
I've been a massive dick long before I pre-made my Forsaken rogue on Arugal.
---
Do you want a scholarship
---
It drops in dungeon from elites with rather low drop chance, but 56k is utter bullshit. Its under 100g at best
---
Same, I'd feel like it's a job. "Play this shitty game so you can afford the game you really want to play".
---
I'd only bother with that for guild first attempts on bosses, I primarily used the best vendor ammo and still crapped on the other dps. Honestly don't recall how much of a difference it had vs crafted ammo, but I was a hardcore min/max at the time and even then didn't bother. Wasn't even a pricing or availability issue, just wasn't a big deal.
---
I don't know about that. I've been playing games 35+ years and the WoW Classic era was the most wonderful gaming experience I've ever had. Nothing can compare to those epic 40-man raids with guildies from all over the world on teamspeak. I had to quit right before TBC because it was taking over my life though...
---
I once was grouped up with a friend doing a quest in Tanaris, and we killed a random scorpid that wouldn’t let me on the flight path, and it ended up dropping the Lei of Lillies BoE epic. We both laughed pretty hard and rolled for it, and he ended up winning it. We then hopped on the flight path and flew to Feralas, and killed a random mob while waiting for the boat to arrive to Feathermoon Stronghold, and sure enough, it dropped a BoE epic bow. 
---
I don’t know if this is really relevant but he won the roll for both of them and I’m still mad about it.
---
&gt; It's Blizzards fault
---
lol...
---
No, world first 60 will be ~3 days /played. Expect the bulk of raiders in a dedicated guild to be able to hit 60 in 4 days /played or less because of dungeon grinding. This is based on beta testing btw, not private servers or 14 year old videos.
---
90-100 hours /played will probably require about 120-130 real hours counting minimal sleep. That leaves 48 hours left in the week, which is plenty possible assuming the guild has enough non-raiders funneling them mats and filling groups (to avoid splitting gear between raiders).
---
Even if that's not enough time in the week, there absolutely, 100% positively will be a kill week 2. There will be many kills week 2.
---
Vanilla WoW is not nearly the unapproachable superhuman feat that you're making it out to be.
---
It's classified as a mercy killing and guilt free.
---
People really need to stop putting PSA in their titles
---
Hakurai's guide on YT or https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H0AWJMvQSIrFdZMTRYcYZcWBsjCPZmy9eHygEWMsKU/edit look pretty solid to me. Hakurai gives a warrior perspective while the doc is paladin based, though both guides claim to be adaptable to any class.
---
Old ironforge that you glitch into?
---
so if they turn off layering the population will be what...8k?
---
For you.
---
I have a limited amount of time, and just want to enjoy the game.
---
If i want to pvp I’ll join a bg.
---
If i need to farm stuff I’d rather not walk into a battlefield.
---
A lot of people also abandoned it due to dragon fatigue. 
---
Besides I wouldn't say group finder was the death of wow. 
---
Having too many low pop servers and faction imbalances is what did it. If you were in a guild or had a group of friends dungeon finder was trivial anyway. 
---
The only people affected were casual players and those that either didn't fit in with guilds.
---
Thanks :) - already watched Grim recently but looking forward see what else you have posted
---
Very moving.
---
Sucks 2 suck
---
I guess we'll see, I'll take my chances, all my friends and guild are going Herod and so am I, got my names reserved on there.
---
yikes this thread
---
Thank you sir. You've helped me decide. I really appreciate ya.
---
There is wakeup on Lan, but SteamLink doesnt have it. I tried set it up with another software but I dont think my motherboard supports it
---
You'll have to keep the computer running to use Steam without WakeuponLan.
---
To just get into the queue earlier you could use stuff like Teamviewer or other remote control software. I personally like Splashtop Streamer, its stable and versitale, and has that wakeuponLan but costs a couple of bucks to access the computer outside your local network.
---
what a surprise...cmon blizz we need more servers...lots of servers..
---
Druid: am i a joke to you?  Dont answer that...
---
Same, that's my monitor right now lol
---
got this little macro for switching between TargetNearestEnemyPlayer and TargetNearestEnemy.
---
/run local T,t,P,m="TargetNearestEnemy","TAB","Player"," is now set to "if GetBindingAction(t)==T then SetBinding(t,T..P)print(t..m..T..P)else SetBinding(t,T)print(t..m..T)end
---
There as in the wall is sealed? Or there as in the glitch don’t work. You had to use illegitimate means to access it until cata.
---
What, NO! Essence of the Newb is like 100g a vial on the AH.
---
He/they where online pretty much 24/7, supplied like 90% of the alliance with enchants.
---
I always hear 'full experience', but people are coy about what the experience is full of.
---
As long as they keep servers small and actually force migrations to keep factions balanced it shouldnt be an issue
---
Drakedog vids are the ones which inspired the most. My first toon on 2005 was a if warlock, i used to play him until 2010. 
---
I roller a 2nd one human un 2006, which was rank 10. My third one will be for classic. Warlock rules. And of course drakedog will be my inspiration again
---
Trick question, you can never reach 99 runecraft
---
This just isn't based in fact. While some players might choose Faerlina because they want to be a part of the Streamer world, even if those streamers leave, those players aren't going to abandon the characters they've played for months just to start over somewhere else, nor are many likely to pay to transfer elsewhere unless they're part of a guild that also collapses because of a particular streamer quitting, which is a very small number of players.
---
What a time to be alive 👍🙂
---
Even with Blizzard's warning of the 10k+ queues at launch? That will take hours to get through...
---
The thing with MSA was it dropped a lot, so sometimes you hadn't seen a good sword/dagger in 3 months and a whole tier, and then you get this amazing slow mace and have to make use of it. Combat maces might have been better possibly for raid dps, but hemo was also great for pvp so people went raiding in hemo spec.
---
The beginning of the end.
---
As an anecdote, i am the only person i know who has resubed and reserved a name. However, i've also wrangled a group of ~10 (and growing?!) to start again. Can't say how long they'll last, but 1:10 ratio is insane even for the first phase.
---
Tacticool. that's my rogue's name.
---
\*shudders\*
---
Thats fine, makes driving your rusty Peugeot to a boring work without future a bit easier
---
It also was initially created as a server only tool so you still grouped with people from your server. 
---
It wasnt until later battle groups and cross realm groups became a thing. Which was a population issue.
---
Weird but ok
---
Striker's Mark and Blastershot are 2.5 and 2.6 though, which will cause shot clipping issues with AS and MS. They'll be better than blues in P1, but the AV crossbow is easier to get and comparable due to 3.1 speed.
---
People saying they literally can't switch servers because they already saved name "xyz" lmao... and now blaming blizzard for it.
---
I thought he played on PvE?
---
To each their own! But also remember that battlegrounds are not available in phase 1 of the game, so will have to wait a bit for any sort of opposite faction battles.
---
Caffeine drinks and random snacks/frozen meals
---
I'll sub next weekend. See if I can take my level 70 to the end of Legion.
---
Pretty good. Only one I'd maybe change is sub/ret. 
---
A subtlety rogue (eventually putting secondary points in combat) using hemo can outlevel a ret pally, IMO. Although maybe not by a ton.
---
What add-ons are you going to use?
---
I think that not full now probably means dead af in 2 months...
---
People don't want the Vanilla high pop experience, they want to be on incredibly over-full servers that are bustling with life 24/7. They want to be on the servers with the community organised events and PVP events. They want to be on the servers with the best competition. You don't get that by jumping ship to a new server after 90% of the hardcore/eager players already decided on where to roll.
---
No NVME m.2? Failing hard my friend... I think wow just won't work.
---
You’re awesome for explaining this so well. Thanks, from a newcomer.
---
nope
---
Not usually but it isn't taught in school
---
Hopefully the queues scare them away
---
I literally just remembered that every spec had its own artwork behind the talent tree. I loved the little splash of flavour it adds.
---
Not really, im just discovering I've apparently lived my life in reverse comparable to a lot of people.  I had just graduated high school when WoW came out 15 years ago, I had to get a career, home, life, etc. together then, that's when I was too busy for WoW. Now I'm in my mid 30s, good job, home, family, more free time, the rat race is over...I didn't come in first but I didn't come in last either, and now it's time to play some WoW.
---
No, much more like retail.
---
No way retail has 2 million subscribers right now.
---
Yep, this solves the problems. Want to pass on the items? Please do. Cheaper for me.
---
They didn't ask your opinion on whether they should use mods; You're redundantly soapboxing.
---
Why not have engi/mining on warrior and herb / alch on the mage. Seems counter productive to have them split up
---
That's true. I leveled to 120 within the first few days, and was bored with BfA 2 weeks in.
---
Yeah because the average person pays $15 2 weeks before they can play something. The fact that we have full servers before the game is even out just for reserving names should tell you the amount of interest there is in this game
---
The people who took this server are just a small percentage of the actual player base. Name reservation is small as well. Maybe skewed is the wrong terminology but idk, seems to me the people who took this might not necessarily reflect the true demographic of the player base come release. Pure speculation on my part but there are a lot of people without subs, and the influx of players come release will show that all the servers currently available will reach full status.
---
Indeed, but the technical limitation was first and the game would be better without it. Would you have to tweak some things? Yes, but it would be worth it imho.
---
Did that all the time back then...
---
Classic client is seperate that you can download now it’s 5gb
---
Is it... and much smaller...
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic
---
Me and my friend haven't subbed yet. We're gonna sub next weekend. I'm not gonna pay approx 7 dollars/ 6 Euros so I can reserve a name.
---
Naw he was definitely on the pvp realm awhile

Yeah they had the data,.or classic wouldn't exist,  they're taking a different approach than you want, filling servers and thennreleasing new ones as needed...this is a warning to the players on shazz that its over populated so move or deal with the queues

 If you roll on a pve realm you lose out on the chance of fighting the enemy faction in the open world which is a huge part of the game. No contesting resources, no coming to the aide of your allies or fighting a random enemy player, no epic battles in contested territories etc

You’re wrong. Keybinds were stored locally in the WTF folder.

Log in right at 6pm est at launch and never log out. Or time your sleeps so you log in at like 4-5 am est and shouldnt be that bad. wake up, login, maybe a decent sized queue, go afk and have breakfast, work out, etc. do what you need to do then come back and play.

firefox is fine though (i have no issues)

Insane how people are not over Brack saying that. It was obviously not a nice thing to say, but he had to come up with a response on the spot and it backfired. Now years later he announces Classic and acknowledges there’s a community for it and people still give him shit. There’s a reason why he announced it.

To help noobies narrow down their class pick. If someone thinks a class sound interesting based on these little tidbit infographics, they can easily find more explicit details in a million other guides, yet I saw very few actually simple quick glance guides for deciding a class.
---
Try it out same level, no skill delta (300 skill vs 60 mob)  
---
1 - 1.2 - 0.03 * 0 = 80%?
---
1 - 1.3 - 0.05 * 0 = 70%?
---
70-80% damage compared to their 5%.  
---
Additonally, the place they source their formula from describes it different.  
---
The actual source they used says that a 300 skill melee attacking a 60 mob, will have glance damage range of:
---
91-99% glance damage.
---
To get this formula:
---
**High: 1.2 - (0.03 * (Defense-Attack))** - Clamped to 0.2 and 0.99  
---
**Low: 1.3 - (0.05 * (Defense-Attack))** - Clamped to 0.01 and 0.91

The % of the population beating end-game isn't a good metric in any game, fact is you can defeat T16 maps in less than a day in a new season and be farming them at near max speed in 2 days, with less gear than ever before because of power-creep which makes the game incredibly boring. It literally became faster paced than Diablo 3, the builds are simpler and easier to play and the screen clutter random deaths are even more annoying.

I think it was patched as I remember fighting people and just before they run out of range you could cast arcane missiles and it would channel the whole spell regardless of how far they were from you. But then when I played a mage in TBC it wasn’t doable. So some time in vanilla it was patched out.
---
I mained a hunter, and up to around level 30 I was buying gear off of the AH based on armor points, and not stat type. So I was wearing stuff with str, spirit, int, etc, not realizing I needed to focus on agi and stam.
---
Also leveled to about 50 going fully into the survival tree, and this was when counterattack was at the end of the tree, and not wyvern sting in the later patches. I was a melee hunter. Not sure how I was able to get that far and was able to get groups for dungeons, because my dps was probably trash since all I had was raptor strike for primary dps lol.
---
The thing is, that you would learn to know new people from your server, outside of your peer group, when taking at least some randoms, if not a whole pug from your server. I did this a lot during vanilla, tbc and even beginning of wotlk, particularly on my tank. Doing a good dungeon run in a pug was often a first step in forming new friendships and I was also scouting for the guild. Maybe you can consider this casual, since it's not optimizing for loot/minute played, but it's one of the things I'm most looking forward to in classic - running dungeons with at least some people I haven't met before, knowing I will probably see them again.

Bis hunter melee weapons can include 1h swords, daggers, a fist weapon, and even a 1h axe in naxx iirc.

Then 2h staff is handy from time to time, and 2h sword. 2h axe is never bis but plenty of easy raid drop upgrades are 2h axe.

You still don't understand how getting a dungeon group really, truly works and what made Classic what it is. You don't mindlessly spam in trade/general until someone happens by and wants to go. You have to ASK people, get a conversation going, be SOCIAL, and actually LOOK for players to fill your spots.  
---
It's the same with getting people to join your guild. Sure, you can spam your guild ad in cities and zone chats all day and invite randoms and sort through the clutter later. But if you REALLY want good people, you need to talk to them directly, and make them interested in your guild.

If there are still long queues, I'll consider re-rolling (my names are unique enough I don't need to worry about reserving them), but not until I see how it plays out.
---
Honestly, there just need to be more servers. Gifting 
---
two whole servers to quarantining streamers and Brazilians doesn't leave enough room from the rest of the community to squeeze into two servers.
---
Not sure if this is applicable but I remember hearing that in early alpha/beta at some point they were planning on Ironforge having 2 levels.  Apparently they scrapped it because it made getting around too complicated/troublesome .
---
Its not that i dont doubt you
---
But i do.
---
It nerfed some fun builds like an elem shaman with two 1h weapons
---
I dont understand the reserving mentality. You're telling me that you get dibs to an item that is also an upgrade, even though we are both putting in time and effort to running this dungeon? By reserving one item, are you automatically gonna pass on all other items? Or do you get a chance at those too? How do I know you won't screw me over and also take anything else that drops since you have master looter on? (Not trying to be hostile here, just asking genuinely because when I played classic 15 years ago, I don't remember ever being in a pug dungeon with master looter on, that was mostly a guild raid thing for distribution of loot through council or dkp).
---
Why do they care?
---
If they quit....
---
Why does everyone think that so many people will quit??
---
We're all here (with such passion and hype) because we think Classic is an incredible game that is sooo much better than retail.
---
I think it's more likely that numbers will increase post-launch, once others (maybe those that were just trying it out of curiosity or retail players waiting for the next patch) see how awesome it is.
---
&gt;"well a boomkin and mage are functionally just different forms of the same exact thing".
---
 
---
Being able to do similar dps to a mage doesn't magically make a moonkin a mage. The differences outside of that remain. Wearing leather, versatility, one being able to make water and portals etc     
---
\&gt; "This will lead to you doing the same process to dozens, or even hundreds of other instances. "
---
I think that's clearly the Slippery slope fallacy. In order to not be a fallacy, you would need to say why they couldn't choose to fix a few -major- things and then stop. This isn't about reblancing all classes, but about fixing a broken spec that doesn't work at all! either it's viable enough to be accepted for the dps raid slot in your average pug or it's not.    
---
The existence of imbalance isn't the issue, imbalance is fine in PVE wow. It's the level of imbalance in raw numbers, it's too great. It's so great that the average player trying to raid with moonkin will do embarrassingly low dps. You could add utility to address this, it's a lot riskier than fixing the dps/mana issue because that can be isolated to the moonkin and doesn't affect other classes. As soon as the moonkin is buffing others you have a lot more rebalancing work to do.     
---
This was fixed at least as soon as wrath, moonkins were raid viable. No questions asked, it wasn't an issue if you could pump out enough dps and had the gear. We weren't brought to your average raid for utility, but as legitimate dps. We were there to throw down some starfires, and occasionally throw some clutch heals if healers stood in fire too long. If the guild needed more tanks we could respec to be a tank with the offspec gear set we've built.          
---
I don't want to be brought along just to buff everyone else despite my terrible dps. 
---
Vanilla did a lot of things right, but one of those things it did very wrong was moonkin.
---
They fixed it in wrath at least (didn't play when TBC was released).  
---
I also play starcraft2, so I appreciate asymmetric balance.  
---
You don't need to make classes the same to balance them, but you do need to give them the tools needed to perform their role properly. The job of a dps is primarily to do dps in raids, there's not too much room to work with since the game's already complete. You can make moonkin a glorified stat stick for the 'real dps' (yawn), or you can fix moonkins dps so it's not laughed out of raids. Moonkin and heal and resurrect, that's enough difference.
---
\&gt; "  "Naix sucks, he just gets kited around and dies. He needs to be faster  or his slow needs to be better". Then icefrog took Rage and buffed the  shit out of it, but left him with a low range slow and unimpressive move  speed. "
---
For pvp the point you've brought up is great, and as I said I'm a big fan of asymmetrical balance, where classes have different strengths that lead them to being balanced overall vs radically different classes. Can even depend on where on the map you are or how much time has passes since the game started. Common advice in terran vs protoss for sc2 was to not let protoss get to lategame. "Just kill them in the midgame", some were asking for buffs to terrans in the lategame, but it was already balanced. Terrans had the advantage early in the game, and protoss would usually win if they stayed alive long enough.     
---
Unfortunately this can't be translated to wow PVE for classic easily. We don't have the design space, the options are too limited. Increase moonkin runspeed? irrelevant. Increase moonkin range? irrelevant or broken. Give moonkin another slow? doesn't work on bosses. You get the idea.  
---
Moonkin provide a 5% damage buff to party? essentially no different to just buffing the moonkin dps, except it's a slight nerf if one of their party dies vs just buffing moonkin directly.  
---
CC isn't that relevant, bosses ignore it.      
---
How you do the dps doesn't matter to raid lead, only that you do enough.   
---
Buffing dps of others isn't more interesting than buffing the dps of moonkin directly.  
---
\*\*TLDR\*\*:   
---
It comes down to making moonkin buff other players to make up for moonking doing terrible dps, or fixing moonkin dps, which they did successfully by the time WOTLK was out. One isn't necesarily more interesting in terms of gameplay or class differentiation than the other.  
---
   
---
Your concerns for homogenization of classes are valid, but apply more to pvp than pve.  
---
For pve if all dps did similar dps, that would be fine. You would have utility built on top of that that made every class different. Think patchwerk, how fast you run doesn't matter the only thing that matters is your dps.  Mages bring water and int buff, druids can swap to healing, MOTW, and resurrect etc     
---
The pvp equivalent would be if it was a 1v1 and both classes rooted to the ground next to each other with no escape, it gives you less room to have asymmetric design without having a clear winner.  
---
For raiding I think the correct thing to do is normalize dps, but build utility and extra gameplay on top of that. There can be difference, but if it's too noticeable some classes just don't get invited to raids. In pvp normalizing dps would be a boring design choice! but it's fine for single target pve raiding.  
---
In raiding you're guaranteed to be behind the boss and it won't run from you. A rogue might as well be a mage (outside of getting cleaved if tank loses aggro etc), as long as they do the same dps. In pvp everything is different, you've got range, stealth, CC, moonkins being able to heal or go travelform being significant etc which you don't have in raiding as much.  
---
What is good design in one type of game, or even one aspect of a game isn't necessarily so when applied to another.
---
Have not seen that one.
---
The same response but more in-depth.
---
you never played retail?
---
Yes. probably a week or two of farming depending how dedicated you are.
---
The queues will be because the server is actually x/x full. Think of it this way (all numbers are generalizations / guesses, not actual data): Let's say that Blizzard expects that 80% of the launch population will quit before phase 2 (tourists from retail who decide they don't like it). Therefore, if they want a server to have 3,000 players on it at one time in phase 2, they are going to let 15,000 players on the server at once at launch (so after an 80% drop you are down to 3,000) but divide those players into 5 layers of 3,000 each to avoid overcrowding.
---
Sure, they could let a server have 10 layers and get 30,000 people online, but then if the quit rate is still only 80%, then that server has 6,000 people during phase 2, and still has long queues, because at that point they will stop layering and only let 3,000 people on at a time.
---
Because of this, there is still an active population cap that servers like Herod will quickly reach. They could increase this cap with more layers, but won't for the long term health of the game.
---
Every dps warrior should expect to tank at some point.
---
Doubtful...
---
My list is filled with retail addons.
---
You're forgetting about Korea and China.
---
Why give people what they want when you can tell them instead
---
This. It was smart to open name reservation two weeks in advance. They know generally what to expect, people can communicate in advance where to go and even move to another server because of reasons intime before the game launches.
---
For me it was a good thing because it made me realize the character I was, has weird else so I got to remake my character.
---
If it was during launch I might have been level 15 before I noticed I made a mistake in the face.
---
Alright man, have a good one.
---
Its not like every expac release has caused massive server issues on the first day before...
---
Surely you mean 11-25 days right? Or are you expecting a perfect launch? :-)
---
I don’t agree, but that’s besides my point.
---
It seems you have no clue what laying is and quoting the whole blue post and saying the same wrong argument over and over doesnt prove your point.  Layering has nothing to do with queue times or player capacity. Each realm can hold so many players and that doesnt change during or after layering.  Layering is only ment to control the massive influx of players at the beginning so you arent waiting 40 minutes to complete a quest while 500 other players all try to do the same quest.  
---
Once the population spreads out over different zones and content layering isnt needed.  Some servers will still be "full" and might have queue times at the busiest play times but layering or lack of wont fix that.
---
As for raising realm capacity also has nothing to do with layering. They dont want to raise realm caps on the most popular servers because they want to balance out the population of all the servers.  That way when the eventual player decline happens a few months in you wont have a few full servers and few dead servers you will hopefully still have balanced and healthy server populations on all realms

The second half of TBC was the major casualization of wow to the point where it no longer appealed to me. Tier 5.5 badge gear making SSC useless, gutting the attunement for black temple (because no one should need to actually kill kael thas to enter black temple?) Basically the expansion where people can become nearly as powerful as anyone went from 40 people required down to 5 with a lot less time investment.

it's really easy to remedy by acting like a grown up and not being attached to a dumb virtual name.  Unless you're RPing, you're just being a petty child about it.

Well good luck... but I think you might be underestimating how bad it's gonna get.

Exactly what I thought lol

Blizzard posted today saying;
---
The increased capacity they're referring to is down to layering.
---
That face does sum up STV
---
I’m sure you don’t. I’m just curious about your reasoning because I find these things interesting.
---
If the bottleneck is the login server, why did Blizzard just plead to people to move away from one specific server? All servers should experience the same login authentication queue if that was the case.
---
Well, one could say it's the only good MMO in town today. I think ESO, SWTOR and FFXIV are both very different games and not a threat to classic.
---
But that is what I think, and I know nothing about the playerbase and how they roll!
---
It will happen here sooner or later.
---
I'm just saying that people give him a lot of shit for saying that people didn't want vanilla. And in reality if you put the entire population of BFA players in vanilla the majority of them would leave. I'm expecting the majority % of players who start classic to swap back to BFA within 1-2 months.

Skimmed through all these posts, and no one mentioned repair bills?? As the tank, your gear takes more damage than other classes, and plate costs noticably more to repair than any other armor type. After a dungeon run you don't get any bonus money from the pugs you just tanked for.

Slower weapons are better but that's not the main reason why. The main reason is that RAP scales to weapon speed, causing a slower weapon to actually do more damage each hit than a faster weapon that claims to do the same damage per hit.

We all know what he meant by ["wife"](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/489661-inflatable-thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker.jpg)
---
You mean bad news AFTER layering was removed. Before pretty much 20+ hunters will get a broken tooth every 6-8 hours. He won't be as rare this time around.
---
Since the stress test, my life is a husk of its former self. There is no joy, only longing.
---
&gt; tourists from retail die out 
---
this phrase has some meme potential
---
It's come such a long way since then, it's actually incredible.
---
Hey, guys, check out this picture I took of a cloud that kind of resembles [thing] from [franchise]!
---
Bt and sunwell were probably some of the best raids in wow
---
AMEN
---
Oh I know WoW blew numbers up on all of these guys. But they were still serious alternatives. The one argument WoW had was sub numbers.
---
Which is not longer really has honestly. Though Classic might change that.

---
I was looking at trying my hand at ADOM or Dwarf Fortress but a lot of planning has to go into those two. Maj'Eyal I can create and go.
---
I'm gonna sub a minute before the servers let me log in and this thread has changed nothing.
---
Its called criticism
---
Question, how the heck this device is called? :D
---
My wife posted this shitpost comment. Upclassics please.
---
Oh wait this isn't /r/wowcirclejerk, never mind.
---
Erm, you know all active retail players can do it right? They're who i mean.
---
I played two months of BFA, stopped, tried another week, then just decided to wait for classic. 
---
To put some perspective there, I played a lot more of WoD, and WoD was ass.
---
Another reason Gehennas is better than Shazzrah:
---
He drops pants.
---
Ladies' man confirmed.
---
TL;DR all the names will be taken, the sky is falling
---
I wouldn't say it's harder, but different. The leveling process takes longer because it was the original 60 levels. They can't have it take that long when there are 120 levels. Mechanics wise for raids vanilla is actually easier until you get to C'thun and Naxx when the mechanics start to become punishing. Retail people that are used to getting max level and raiding within 1-2 days might find it tedious it takes a while to get to 60.
---
The argument that addons are bad doesn't hold water.  What some don't realise is that the base game has addons built into it.  They're written by Blizzard but they're still addons in every sense of the word.  So it's impossible to play Wow without addons.
---
The auction house, talent system, combat log, flight map, macro system, world map, tradeskill system, raid system, inspect system, nameplate system... the list goes on and all of these are addons written by Blizzard.  They're all written in Lua and they're no different to the addons available on CurseForge.  No different whatsoever.  They're even packaged the same as third party addons.
---
What third party addons do is exactly the same as the built-in addons.  It's the same code but it's tailored to a more personal experience and that can only be a good thing.  One player might use Blizzard\_WorldMap (Blizzard's built-in map addon) and another might use a map addon written by a third party.  Both players are technically using addons so it makes no difference.
---
P-server vanilla experience.
---
Little bit of Retail just to help a friend out since he knows I'm currently subbed.
---
Risk of Rain 2.
---
Have "Kindly " on Faerlina, Whitemane, Fairbanks.

It was bad. Especially because few people had the UBRS key and many wouldn‘t join a group that didn‘t have somebody with the key already.

---
Well good luck on those queue times and on getting in then. You're gonna need it if you play on anything but a PvE server. This post though I didn't explicitly say so implies what the majority of people seem to want : PvP realm.  
---
PvE realm though ? You're fine. I think.
---
I can't believe I find myself agreeing with things Mark Kern is saying on a semi-regular basis nowadays.  What a time to be alive.
---
Alternatively they could order the murder of all male children under the age of two in Azeroth. There by avoiding the prophecy that... um... Azeroth will be one day ripped asunder by a giant dragon?
---
Unless you're neck deep in retail already, the number of hours it takes to farm a token is not worth it for the vast majority of the playerbase.
---
Drops are not the point. The implementation of build archetypes was a huge step in favour of casuals, disregarding the hardcore players. Melee patch? Play cyclone and you steamroll entire game, thats why it's at 50% usage on poeninja. Trap patch (incursion league)? Arc trap and youre done with the game in no time. Thats how poe is now.
---
Op builds always existed, but never a single spell/ability was at 40%/50% usage.
---
Brian Kopp’s allincw guide was always free
---
YES! I have mine on the mantle. I'll post a pic tomorrow. I was just looking at it. 
---
There was a queue to get them at first, took me a month to get in.
---
So what I'm getting out of this is 
---
- Names will be taken
---
- Waaaah its hard being Blizzard
---
ok?
---
Pat! Such awesome videos
---
Reservations are announced ahead of time when forming the group. If someone is putting together a group and has reserved an item for that run, but you want a chance at that item, don't join that group. Usually they will only turn master loot on for the boss that drops that specific item, then back off.
---
Most often items are reserved by tanks or maybe healers, because they can afford to exclude some people who also want that item and form a group of people who don't care about it, because their role is in such demand.
---
yes i do, but i was still curious.
---
 Not to be b*tching about but oh boy if only they could have listened to this sub and properly forecast the interest in the game, oh but no they went with way too few servers for reasons /s
---
"Look at this building, it's ancient history! Almost 100 years old!!!!"
---
Uhhhh, no decades are 10 years, they are never 9 OR 10, its just 10, you're using decades like numbers, which is wrong, time and numbers hardly ever correlate. Jan 1st 2000 and december 31st 2009, is ONE decade, TEN years, thinking about it in terms of 2000 to 2009, which can be correct, it's not a definite. Long story short a decade is always 10 years not 9 or 10.... technically YOU are wrong. Jan 1st 0000 to december 31st 0009 is the FIRST decade (if using the BC and AD scale)
---
I'm playing on pvp and I'm gonna be a-okay
---
Yeah, them trying to fix server pop on retail worked so well.
---
but even without a pet, he shoot me and i still got aggro from guards without any buffs
---
Make it a roaming npc. Some boar dragging her from the leg. Chewing it.
---
I think what they did was make it way easier to go to different areas. Instead of one large dungeon there are 3 portals to take you to the different areas. That's the best I can remember. And yeah I think there was some stuff taken out
---
Gotta be smart and save your friends names yourself :)
---
I've got exams (last one the 29th) so no gaming for me. Except for maybe some OSRS before I go to sleep.
---
it's showing you retail addons because you have retail installed and right now they're under the same category.
---
Layering, layers.
---
From what they have said recently, the would just let the queues handle the overpop (perhaps with other yet to be announced measures).
---
Yup.  Not that they won't find a way to screw this up a bit, I think it is astoundingly unlikely that Blizzard isn't on top of this problem for the most part.  Consider the motives here.  Do people honestly think they are instituting Classic to make a vocal subset of existing subscribers (and even recent unsubs) happy?  
---
They are doing this because it will lure many thousands of long-ago unsubs back to the game.  Classic will be a cash cow for Blizzard at least in the short term.  It is absolutely business critical that they don't screw this up too badly.  I don't think they will do that.  Heck, having server queues (so long as they aren't *too* long) only heighten the intrigue.  Blizz probably *wants* queues to an extent.
---
Not that I mind myself, but also the fact guilds are literally gonna have downed rag in 2 weeks is likely a put off for a lot of people. Going to give the impression you cant catch up.
---
That's a dragon not a gnome.
---
Tbh it isnt bad. When the character resrrvations were i got in 11k queue and got trough it in 8 mins. Its not like you will be in hour+ queue
---
I never mentioned a pet in my explanation above.
---
Apes are on Gehennas right? Don't think it will fill up that quick.
---
And get banned, sounds like a plan.
---
I know you can join or create your own chat channels in wow. I usually /join world
---
There's a reason some Rogues are called PvE Combat drones. Combat is good, but all you really need is Imp Sprint and shove the rest in Sub tree.  
---
There's nothing more embarrassing than seeing a Combat Rogue pop all his CDs in the first 5 seconds of the fight and then wander around useless because he blew his load too early and is now CCed...
---
DOOM 2016
---
Bet you want personal loot like on retail
---
Cata

---
I've never had great success with WoL. It only seems to work when resuming from sleep and not actually powered down.
---
Making others who want to enter to play normally wait longer just so u can be inside and not do anything? 
---
Yeah, if that’s not a douchebag move, then I want nothing to do with you.
---
I wouldn't know havn't seen KJ since Cata.
---
Not really the point of my post no. I didn't mention names even once ?   
---
Talking about realm availability. Also like 2/3 of my message is advertisement for RP-PvP realms so ...  
---
You didn't read it at all.
---
I love you!
---
&gt;They cannot possibly turn off phasing.
---
I'm sure its just a big button in blizzard HQ. They definitely won't forget where it is or something. Yeah can always turn it off.
---
Albion Online, and some Island Defense in wc3.
---
That's more for pvp than pve raiding though. The designspace for classic wow raiding is far more limited.  What icefrog did was good design for dota.
---
It's a good example for pvp or even non-raid pve in wow. e.g. how a warlock kills multiple mobs by rain tanking mobs vs how a frostmage does it.   
---
I think it's a poor example for wow raiding, however.   
---
A rogue might as well be a mage once the fight starts, what matters is which one does more dps. A moonkin doesn't bring enough dps, and doesn't have essential utility like buffing all the warlocks (shadowpriest) so isn't brought. Increasing range, runspeed, health etc would be relevant for pvp, but not so much for pve raiding. Hunters can kite, but that doesn't help this specific problem we have with moonkin not being viable.  
---
Either moonkin gets a buff in the form of the damage it does over an avg boss fight, or the same buff just in a different form, by buffing the damage of others in the party. If not, it remains a meme spec. This is without redesigning the raid fights, which isn't realistic.    
---
Viewing moonkin mana issues as a bug and fixing that, I could see that happening.
---
It did happen! by WOTLK it was fixed. Bringing moonkin dps up to viable didn't water down the class or make it too similar to others, was still the same class but it could raid after the changes.   
---
\&gt; " He really does a great job at allowing players to discover new metas  "     
---
We had a long time to discover the metas for moonkin. None of them included moonkin being viable for raiding. Shadowpriest for buffing warlocks? yes! melee hunter to spam wingclip with a certain weapon? yes! moonkin? no.      
---
The gap in dps is too great and there isn't much an individual player or raid leader can do about that.  
---
Even making use of consumables doesn't bridge that gap. The great stuff icefrog did doesn't translate well to pve raiding in wow. You go from having massive player agency and everything you do mattering in dota and pvp wow, to your decisions being reduced to \*\*"press these few buttons and don't stand in fire"\*\*, that and the gear and consumables you have available. Moonkin talents don't let you pull a rabbit out of a hat and bridge that dps gap either.
---
I am guessing new realm and free transfer. It is a shitty solution, but one that may be needed unless there is a large drop off.
---
But i like WoW classic art :/
---
I just googled it because I wasn’t sure, I know it was an hour and did in later exp but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was that way in vanilla, they should last an hour and persist through death though, although I saw someone reported a beta bug that deadly poison did not, like the other poisons. No response on whether it was addressed but I imagine it will be fixed.
---
alright, so how the hunter get debuff from ice armor? he is ranged dps and never gets the debuff from mage
---
I won't try to be doom and gloom, but the gaming community tends to all jump on the hype train of whatever the new shiny is, without thinking about it too hard. They just want to be a part of the new big thing everyone is talking about. Not that Classic is bad by any means, but every MMO that releases has a pretty large drop off after the newness wears away.
---
"hey, this physical hardware limitation you guys have... just increase it!" - every douchebag boss, always
---
Just a quick +1 to this, yes the difference is noticeable
---
There is nothing wrong with you my friend! It’s awesome! Feel all the feels!
---
kof
---
Not really ... did you even read this ?
---
I want to see population stats for each server every week after launch.
---
Feel the need to rub some faces in it.
---
Omg. Healing will be so more enjoyable.
---
Seriously, I just subbed yesterday and got my name on Stalagg, Thalnos and Herod
---
I think I leveled my warlock to lvl 114 then dropped the game. Completely lost the feel of wow to me, another game entirely.
---
As a borderline alcoholic (just beer) I’m using classic to help me curtail my addiction to alcohol and instead place it upon Azeroth to deal with me.
---
all info that i got, sadly no video
---
Got to level 120 then quit, they ruined the game.
---
Retail wow, HoTS, Apex Legends, anything to pass the time
---
Your friends will be trying to make you move when they see the 10 hour queue.
---
Literally just a blue blood elf on alliance
---
Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Deutschland, Luxembourg, Belgium and on some extents Andorra &amp; Monaco.
---
Cost me £45 return last time I visited my guildies in Copenhagen.
---
By comparison it cost £40 in fuel to drive to more guildies in the peak district
---
Better an info to be posted twice than not at all, no ?  
---
Why are people behaving like asses on this sub recently though, is that waiting for Classic that puts people on edge ? Gets cancerous here lately.
---
Such a load of horseshit. You could be the most hardcore player in vanilla WOW, get unlucky, NEVER get two binding drops in MC, and then just never get the best tanking weapon. You could be doing Naxx and still not have TF just because the game was nothing but RNG and you got fucked.
---
The game's always been pure RNG bullshit. Retail WOW is actually far more hardcore than vanilla ever was. +15 mythics with shitty affixes and mythic raiding are far more challenging than anything in vanilla. The only real difference between WOW then and WOW now is that they added tourist modes for all the content so basically everyone can "see" everything.
---
Play if you feel like it
---
Don’t play if you don’t feel like it
---
Ah must be some chain not in my area
---
There will be and it‘s said somewhere in the official FAQ or somewhere (I just read it yesterday). Just not the „how“.
---
I actually have a feeling, that population of servers will rather steadily increase than decline
---
Really? 
---

Come play on Fairbanks PvP Horde side
---
Mostly just small reskins on current races
---
Yes but Blizzard is banking on people in your situation switching over to alleviate some of the overpopulation. Any little bit helps at this point.
---
calm down its literaly a videogame gnome  also whats your obsession with impregnation? did you knew that women in real life exist? maybe you should try interacting with one you batshit insane  weeb
---
Yup wtf
---
My take has always been the community are against too many servers because that will result in dead worlds once the hype dies down and a large % of the player base has already quit before they hit 60. The issue with this realm is it became a popular destination, helped in part due to the overblown streamer server(s) drama. Not because of a lack of servers.
---
How did you summon him on the first day exactly?
---
You had to get reputation with the waterlords in order to clear all the runes, which shouldn't be possible on the first run I don't think?
---
Millions of people will be returning for classic. I myself have been away from wow for the last 8 years.
---
Priests got a talent in alpha or beta to get a battle rezz. Sadly it never made it to the game. On the other side: it would have killed druids probably
---
Yes. 
---
That’s why I’m happy I dumped my ex, and that I’m taking a month off work.
---
You need prioritize your life. What is important to you?
---
This is good shit still xD will be listening to it all over while levelling.
---
I keep hearing this but on the flip side how many people that reserved a name will be tourist? If you paid the 7$ likely your going to play exclusively classic. If you play retail you will most likely be a tourist. 
---
I dont think the people that sub at launch will be tourist, they're returning players. Some may leave, but I dont see why their more likely to leave than someone who had a shot at reserving their name. Very few people even got the name they wanted, and now are having to jump ship anyway to avoid queues.
---
Now bfa lvling is soo fast, and pretty fun, also i had 3 days 12hrs til lvlcap , but on 120 you just bored in farming  world quests and pearls alone for character progression, in classic you have much more pleasure when you get new level, new talent, new spell, especially with big social interaction. 
---
You cant lfg just for quests or dungeons without talking with real people, you cant kill same quest mobs with someone if you arenot in party.
---
Classic have many small rewards, and much more social interaction, but also its have big rng in pvp situations, even green geared shaman/warrior/almost any class can 1shot your epic geared mage. Rng is fun and good for casuals.
---
I still can't believe it's actually happening
---
Pretty much. I paid to get my names early and tried about 10 names on Stalagg and they are taken. I wouldn't care as much if Blizzard didn't try to make a quick buck by offering name reservations so early then ninja launching a new server. Kinda scummy
---
It really depends what you're more focused on. If you're looking to raid, however, you might just be better with a raid spec and deal with the disadvantages in PvP until your guild is able to comfortably clear content, and pulling that extra 10% dps isn't that big of a deal anymore.
---
I've seen a few comments on this but don't understand. Can you elaborate?
---
Same issue with Minecraft. I’m done.
---
Be a casual. not everyone has to make it an obsession.
---
I never came that far in vanilla because I was such a slow leveler. This time baby I will make some memories for myself
---
Heavily modded Fallout 4.
---
It’s already on youtube
---
I think thats the only way to use wol
---
I'm not crying, you're crying!
---
A vast portion of the playerbase will quit when levelling gets too tough for the retail babies and we'll have decently sized servers. By phase 2 it'll have calmed down IMHO
---
Warcraft 3. Highly recommended to reset your lore-brain back to WoW launch times.
---
Also planning to play some Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
---
to say I'm hype is an understatement
---
Yeah, they should've made it like GW2, a game that came out 8 years after WoW and had time to learn from the mistakes of previous MMOs and still managed to lack an end-game worth anything for a year.
---
yes
---
I dont think it's likely, but I'd love for it to overshadow retail just so maybe some retail design philophy changes.
---
Oh, lol. I totally didn’t realize that you’re probably not American...
---
Jack in the Box is a fast food burger place. Direct competition to McDonalds/Burger King.
---
They are known for being open 24/7, though. So it has a reputation for attracting many stoners/drunks at night.
---
They will add servers at launch, to which you can go. 100% certain
---
WoW's gameplay even in 2006 was far far more polished and refined than EQ. Obviously it's not as smooth as what WoW is today, but it's a far cry from what EQ was.
---
Well they don't speak Russian either
---
Still, I live in the extrem south in France (extrem as in « I can see the sea from my balcony ») and it still takes 7 hours in train to reach Belgium!
---
Even that’s a laughable time as a Canadian, I suppose.
---
When WoW releases I was a teenager, now I’m 35 and have a LOT less free time, it will take me probably 3 months to get anywhere near level 50, never mind 60. As I’m sure others will have said, play it when you feel like playing! There are always people who want to jump in and out and it will be so busy during the first 12-18 months there will always be someone to interact with.
---
Layering is how they reduce queues.  Each layer can hold a certain amount of players, so to reduce the queues they can add layers (increase the pop cap).
---
However, in Phase 2 every server will only have 1 layer.  You can't go from a server with 10 layers to a server with 1 layer and not have huge queues unless you lose 90% of the initial player base.  It's just not likely.
---
Therefore, the maximum number of layers they will start with is directly related to their expected drop-off rate.
---
It's too bad we're full otherwise I'd be able to tell you to fuck off to your face.  
---
Fuck off; We're full.
---
Source?
---
then tell me an alternative to level up to 40? I tried the 30ish area in Kalimdor as well and died there several times.
---
gadjet
---
Keep in mind they're also using dynamic spawning of creatures and items in start areas.
---
This is golemagg erasure right here

---
Ofc. Games like fortnite and fifa ultimate team stuff (how is it called?) are successful as hell. Those short slotmachine type of games are working like a casino does. Is it good game design? No ofc not. Is it successful. Sadly it is
---
The true true
---
who cares though
---
Checked out during WotLK. I have no idea what WoW has become after that. From reading these forums lately it looks like I didn't miss shit over the last decade.
---
Here is the thing. They did that already its called retail. Literally everything they changed and added to the game through the years was based on player feedback. It's what we wanted lol
---
Without tf there will be lots of threat issues later on, just because you can’t afford to wait 20 seconds.. not every guild will have their tf when aq or naxx needs to be done.
---
whole bosses + quite a bunch of situations or phases in bossfights in which the raid has to make sure not to overaggro
---
Great to know, thank you!
---
Yes, really.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20061107023627/http://www.briankopp.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107023627/http://www.briankopp.com/) 
---
I distinctly remember receiving multiple DMCA complaints for sharing it \~
---
I get the reason why Blizzard chose to use cross-server for LFG. But I never ever understood why they implemented teleporting to the instance. It makes no sense what so ever to me. It's not like it was hard to run to the istance - heck you had a mount or even a FLYING mount to do so, but still they chose the "click on this one button and we'll serve you the instance (and loot) on a silver platter". 
---
That's just taking the word 'convenience' too far in my opinion. 
---
I like your ideas about modifying the Meeting Stone system btw. But I agree that because of Blizzard's own screw-up and stubbornness it's not something that we'll see in the game, unfortunately.
---
But that's the point here.  Most (all,by definition!) new MMOs are untried concepts - loads of hype, but the actual content could be anything. 
---
That rule would apply if Blizzard were launching WoW2, but Classic is very much tried and tested.  We know it is a good game.
---
Imo, the only thing that could f**k it up is exactly this - servers too crowded, login queues / general issues, too much layering, layering that they then can't remove (because the servers are still way over 'non-layered' capacity at the end of phase 1)...

until lvl 60 you can easily heal all dngeons as shadow skilled, in Classic unlike retail you got all spells available no matter your specialisation. 
---
I'll lvl my Priest as [Disc/shadow](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/051230133205141--35025000005) puting the pointe in shadow first and make good use of wands with shadowdamage.
---
Spirit tap is criminally underrated.
---
I will say pvp is more unique in classic and if you will have the full experience go pvp, 
---
I played on a pve server back in vanilla, and have played pvp on pservers. 
---
There is something special about it, it’s like adding an extra reason up why it’s a good idea of creating connections in game. Sometimes depending on the place: a 1v1 can sometimes swap to a full scale war, and the story about a game which take place in a midst of a war between two factions. Many anecdotes can come out of pvp that are unique to another, and you might be saved by someone or you might save someone, in a particular awesome fashion and now you’ve gained a new friend!
---
It’s also adding to the element that Azeroth is a dangerous world, and you have to be careful and come prepared. What is more dangerous than mobs? .. that’s players. Furthermore it creates faction identity. You really get it is us against them kind of feeling which is thrilling. wPvP was for me one of the absolute best features in wow. As soon as flying mounts were introduced it kinda turned into a shadow of its former self. Therefore now without flying mounts wPvP is truly special in classic.
---
Ganking does happen... you’ll get gank, and you gank yourself.. but I ever rarely experience it to an obnoxious point.. and when you do, just take like a 3-5 min break. People would rarely wait that long anyway. If they’re, just get a group and get rid of the scums. 
---
From experiencing both worlds both pve and pvp servers I gotta say, you rob yourself from an experience and a feature for going on a pve server in classic.
---
I paid early to experience the stress test, so saving my name was just an added bonus
---
It... Doesn't work that way mate.
---
Not to mention that it would often be the same players. But hey, if you're finding tons of people for BGs and PVP in your area on Retail, kudos to you.
---
Except... I've heard this complaint on multiple occasions, platform's and from different areas. Literally Google it. 
---
But you keep shillin' dude, whatever makes you 😊
---
I think the only real issue with waiting right until launch to sub is that the subscription page on the website will probably crash due to high demand.
---
I’ll never forget my first epic was the baron rivendare Mount. Granted it was in BC and not vanilla but still insane. At the time I had no idea what had even happened. Couldn’t even use the damn thing until my guildies explained the situation to me lol
---
Actually I'd like to amend my statement from an hour ago. I just checked, the best ammo in the game is vendor ammo. It beats all other ammo, including thorium. That must be why I never used it.
---
Ironically I  still have a HUGE NOTEBOOK of his printed out guides for the original
---
Too real that it hurts.

Who are you?

If you ain't ready for the grind then don't waste your time. /flex

Super oddly enough I am American we just don't have them in my part of the country. But I appreciate the explanation since I actually didn't know what it was!

---
Get omniCC and Immersion as well
---
Except this diagram isn’t measuring time for each level it’s measuring xp needed per level.   It since you gain more Xp per quest and move as you level up, your so per hour also increases therefore this is an inaccurate representation of time per level.
---
Need a solution not consequences :)
---
There are a lot of ways to prevent this in other ways than by paying money. For example, making it only available to people with battle net account with some games on it. Make one name free and up to 3 or even 5 names only for people with subscriptions.
---
That would give them a much better idea of how many people will play, so I doubt they were driven by that.
---
Also it favors people subbed to bfa, who may not be as interested in playing classic a other people who quit wow.
---
Buying Icy or Iced on shazzrah EU. Will buy or trade for ‘Air’ on mirage raceway
---
No no it's time for Shazxit and Gehentry!
---
Dude, they've already increased the caps to account for their expected drop off.  A Medium server today is several times larger than a Full realm in vanilla.  This is because they expect to lose players such that that server drops down to being Vanilla Medium in Phase 2
---
If you read properly, you will understand that I start to care a lot after you log in. 
---
Whatever you say, it is still a douchebag tactic
---
Probably about as many people who care about the low-effort memes posted here.
---
I just thought it was slightly interesting that Jack’s is specifically targeting WoW players.
---
If you don’t think so, that’s fine.
---
The only thing I can come up with is Mister Smee from the pirate ship in Peter Pan, but that's a stretch.
---
Of cource there will be a drop in population.  We are all aware of this.
---
But I disagree.  Herod with only 30% of it's pop left is still an average or healthy server for vanilla standards.
---
I refuse
---
My man, that's basically why I couldn't ever get bored of playing rogue @ 60

'Being poor is kinda fun' - Reckful
---
Yeah agree 50-60 is a breeze and you’re already collecting endgame prebis at these levels so they’re less relevant.  Sure you may ding 60 but you’ll be running the same dungeons as u were at 55+ to get your prebis.

Renataki's Charm of Trickery makes combat so much better to play in PvP. Combat, oddly enough, is more cooldown dependent than other specs in PvP.

"I get those goosebumps everytime ya..."
---
Art and cosplay does not belong in subreddits dedicated to games in my opinion.
---
I come to this subreddit to have discussions around classes, mechanics, encounters, things that are actually part of the game.
---
If I want see someone dressed up as an elf that for some reasons also wears a mini-skirt and a bra four sizes too small I'm sure theres a seperate, dedicated sub for that weird shit.
---
How painful are the ammunition costs? 
---
Do tauren hunters get bonus range with a ranged weapon?
---
Since hunters don't scale that well in classic, do any of you plan to play a hunter first and then level an alt that will later transition into a main? I'm thinking of doing something like this in case I get REALLY frustrated with the class later on (context: I don't plan to play hardcore, but I do plan to try raiding; waiting for BG's before doing any serious PvP as I will be playing on a normal server).
---
While that makes sense, I’m slightly bummed because they could have said so in advance, not only when everyone is hysterical. IMO communication and listening to the fan base hasn’t been their strongest side, even if recently they started to communicate post facto with their player base (same for Hearthstone)
---
Honestly if you’ve got the money try Kenshi. It will prepare you for the grind.
---
And it's not true really.
---
Just imagine the shitstorm if they didnt have name reservations before launch with only 2 pvp servers
---
In America there's up to 31 months in a year. And only 12 days in a month. That's why they're all rich. They get paid every 12 days.
---
Amaizing video. Makes me want to roll on Grob

---
Jesus christ dude this game is from 2004 you're going to literally kill it with that rig.
---
Not sure how it was on release but elite demons in Winterspring definitely dropped the eye of shadow on retail servers at a like 1-3% drop chance. Bring a warlock and enslave something cool and go to town! I remember getting 2 in a group of 3 of us in under 4 hours, that was how I paid for my epic mount.
---
Holy shit, that’s actually kind of mind blowing!
---
If you ever leave your area and like to eat Garbage, you definitely have to give it a try! Really good food, especially if you’re not sober.
---
2h swords are also BIS. ZinKroh and Ashkandi scream hunter item PVE wise (no pun intended)
---
They’ve done a good job censoring it, but Tipsout commited à major fraud IRL. He’s also horrible at the game and fake and should not be followed.
---
They reiterated their position mere hours ago, layering WILL be turned off before P2 EVEN THOUGH they know servers are overloaded.
---
They'll offer transfers.
---
And a 10k queue should be around 9 hours to get through.
---
There's that as well. Though [battle.net](https://battle.net) has a queuing system as well. I'm not actually worried about queues. If you have a queue nowadays it means you're getting in at some point if you don't screw it up by trying to switch realm of something.   
---
Just thinking that there are servers where character creation is locked for newcomers, and that it may get worse before launch. And if everyone waits last sec to sub, sure Blizzard is probably expecting this and has servers ready to go on demand, but launching new servers *during* a launch ... well. Seems a bit like recipe for disaster on player end  ...   
---
But that's just my thoughts - not trying to tell people what to do, just thought I'd offer the advice. Apparently it wasn't welcome \*Shrug\*
---
Play in your free time, set short achievable goals for yourself. The later phases will have more for low level and casual players like battlegrounds
---
If you wait until 60 do you have a 1, then a 5?
---
There were ways to transmog your gear client side during vanilla (model swapping) and blizzard wasn’t exactly cool with it.
---
I would not say it casualized it. It opened the genre. There were still enough hardcore ways to sink 24hours a day into wow – if you wanted to. I played some runescape and galaxies before and those games were just ridiculous
---
Do you need a lot of time to play minecraft ? Becaise it seemed a nice alternative game to play (multiplayer servers with minigames etc). Never really played a lot
---
Tried every expansion except Legion, solely in hopes of finding any resemblance to Vanilla gameplay and feel. 
---
It's only gotten worse with time.
---
Thats one hella setup
---
&gt;When they get rid of the layers the population threshold will go back down to "normal."
---
If that's true it would only mean "medium" servers would be renamed "full", and "full" servers would have horrible logging queues.
---
Not worth. Hunter is the easiest character to reach hit cap anyway
---
bonfire studios is a company like that, featuring many previous blizzard employees. They still haven't announced any games though
---
I played till level 11 or so on retail, only mmo ive played was ESO (which i really find unfun rn). Im looking forward to classic since i wont be playing catchup with anyone. Just going to quest together with a friend.
---
Hey thanks for being an asshole!  So much easier being an asshole than just keeping your mouth shut or offering  a worthwhile response. Also if you'd bothered to actually read my post you'd see I'm not playing retail.
---
MMOs are unhealthy habits if you no-life them. Treat wow as a normal hobby &amp; balance it with work, spouse, and parent obligations, and it can still be fun.
---
I’m the same age and have the same obligations. I find it liberating knowing I won’t have time to get the best gear. I can engage with the game as I want, find a casual guild, and avoid wow becoming a 2nd job as it did back in 2006.
---
What do you mean? Everybody is still here.
---
Just because a discord channel exists doesn't mean that the guild will come to fruition in game.
---
cant decide between rogue and a mage :(
---
There are some good staves while leveling.
---
Can anyone else wrap their heads around how ironic it was to implement queues for dungeons in a massive multiplayer game that is supposed to promote open world environment? Blizzard lost their product when they made the game linear.
---
You might be right. I guess I'm looking for people to remind me of all the good parts &amp; the fun parts that I'll be missing if I skip it because of the grind.
---
Op is beyond retarded
---
It was, but they have swapped to Gehennas now
---
I think they’re mostly trying to get Herod to spread out a little bit more. Without this clarification the people who were going to move had moved, so they needed to be very pointed about who needs to move servers. The new PvP server they added is at medium population, and the people on Herod are scared of not being on the biggest and best server. They need some encouragement. They’ll see another server in a couple days, I’m sure.
---
^ that's bait
---
Well that's your right to do so.
---
I member
---
You should definitely with BM and then transition to MM all the way to mortal shots. The strength your pet picks up from the bottom half of BM is insane compared to 100 attack power and some %damage from the MM tree at bad gear levels.
---
clASSisc
---
I made a post and accidentaly said the name of a private server and it got taken down almost immediately.  Wth mods?
---
The 5 of us are rocking horde on Shazzrah. Maybe see you there!
---
TBC and wrath, much as I enjoyed them, did their own to skew the design philosophy and start the games decay. Classic+ all the way.
---
There is so much gay in this picture.
---
 4 weeks in br1
---
I'll try it sometime. I do leave the area sometimes I promise but it's usually on vacation and fast food isn't my first choice. But now I'm curious. I think we don't have a lot of stuff in my area like I've never seen a White Castle but that one I have actually heard of
---
Did the same, and I ended up  playing 40 hours on the stess test, testing all the different classes I had in mind to level and found which one I wanted to play as main. I fell the 7$ extra was well worth it. Havnt had that much fun in years
---
Shit like this was bad design. Atiesh was a way better design and how TF should have worked. 
---
Fragments that have a high chance to drop but you need a lot of them so basically you had to put actual time into MC. 
---
Vanilla's really overrated in terms of design, honestly. Its real strengths were the art, music, and atmosphere.
---
If you found the trial daunting, I recommend you stick with BfA. Classic is, as it states, classic. Mechanics are set back to how they were in the past, classes and content also. Current WoW is much easier and since one sub works for both, you can always try classic later.
---
Man the frozen throne is such a classic. Nothing beats a winter maul or legion td from time to time IMO.
---
Although I'm not sure I've ever heard it called this, I suspect what you're talking about is weaving your abilities in between your auto attacks so that they don't cancel them out. 
---
If you're using a 2.9 second attack speed bow and cast Aimed Shot .1 seconds before your next auto attack, you'd go 5.8 seconds without an auto attack. If you auto attack, then instantly que up Aimed Shot, you'd only go about 3.1 seconds. Always weave to maximize damage, never cancel out autos unnecessarily. Also related somewhat, you don't want to let Serpent Sting fall off and you don't want to re-apply it halfway through its duration. Try to time it so that the projectile lands on the target within .5 or even the exact moment it's about to fall off. I believe it ticks every 3 seconds, so if you reapply it at 13 seconds (one second after the next to last tick of damage) then you'd go 5 seconds without a tick (since it won't tick the first time until three seconds has passed). But if you apply it as I said earlier it'll just be essentially one long continuous dot with no hiccups. 
---
Hope this was helpful.
---
Essentially weaving abilities in between your auto shot so you maximize DPS output. Think auto shot then aimed shot, and by the time aimed shot is fired auto shot is ready again.
---
I'm not sure it's cringe to offer friendly advice but ... sure. I don't care, I have my characters ready to go. Just saying that for people wanting to resub to avoid getting a bad surprise on launch day. You know, help thy neighbor stuff ?
---
4k pr0n
---
Oh I agree completely. I wasn't trying to say 2006 WoW gameplay is the same as original EQ. 
---
But I would argue that current WoW gameplay is as much better than 2006 WoW as 2006 WoW was better than EQ gameplay. So I think going back is going to be super jarring.
---
Gonna get pooped on with no gear
---
Those who play retail might have logged on to reserve a name cause they have sub anyway. Sure they probably wasn't waiting for the realm list to change colour from gray but they might have done it now before the masses on the 27th
---
&gt; I would not say it casualized it. It opened the genre
---
^ this
---
Prior to World of Warcraft, MMORPG populations were usually around the 200k mark.  WoW revolutionised the genre by opening it up to a broader audience.
---
This sub is extremely toxic. Your best bet is to post during NA peak hours and pray that your post will get a few upvotes before people smush it into the ground.
---
Don't take it personally - There are many people who take joy in downvoting posts to 0 in New before they get a chance to take off.
---
I'd have to buy BFA no thanks and that's valuable grind time to waste for a few dollars a month. I'd rather give out handys at a bus stop to pay my sub fee if it came down to it. Luckily I havn't quit my job yet but always have a plan.
---
Thank you, do you think getting Bestial Wrath is better than Scatter shot? (pvp server leveling)
---
Whitemane for Mega Milk
---
Yup, PvE for the win. I want to level without being annoyed by gankers.
---
I leveled as a noob way back when on Dunemaul-PvP-EU and that was enough PvP leveling for me.
---
Now, when I get home from work I want to level and not get corpse camped.
---
I can’t relate man, it’s that struggle for nodes that has me keen to play.
---
As I understand it, it is making sure to only use your abilities in-between your auto-shots so as not to cut-off the autoshots and lower your DPS. This is much easier with an autoshot timer add-on that will visually show you when you need to stand still and not use an ability so you can fire your auto-shot, and when you are free to move around / fire off abilities because your auto-shot is on cooldown. There are a bunch of those add-ons for Classic.
---
/r/drama
---
blizzard won't add more servers until they fill up, they stated this, and put out a post HEAVILY encouraging people to move off of Herod and into Stalagg. They're literally giving us an explanation of how to get more servers, but people are refusing because they'd rather have 10 hr queue times on Herod than move to another server. Why would they add more servers if people are just gonna bunch up regardless
---
This is EXACTLY why I rolled Fairbanks.
---
The shit server name of the shit NPC turned out to be the 200 IQ play.
---
Damn, it feels so good.
---
This came up a lot in the Beta. Blizzard said it's the same as vanilla but if you have played on pirate servers then that could be what your remembering. Or you just sucked at video games back in vanilla. I know I did
---
Why do you think the economy inflated during Cata when Kezan blew up?
---
Ranking in Classic is \_very\_ time consuming, even more than raiding. Considering you want a high rank..
---
I think they are just adding servers as the current ones fill. There doesn't seem to be any ulterior motive for it. It sucked that they never really gave notice that it was happening. They definitely need more servers and waiting until the current ones fill to make others is probably the safest way to prevent servers from becoming barren wastelands in the future.
---
Awesome! How did you get the game to not have a border in window mode?
---
Same feelings here. Finding a suitable  guild will be some sort of quest :)
---
lol nice
---
Nah I’m just doing it for the fun. Not really trying to get high rank
---
hahaha same thought, like, niicce... uhm no.
---
Really the bottom line is that weapons from a higher tier (pre - T1 - T2 - T2.5 - T3) will always have a higher DPS and will pretty much always be an upgrade from a lower tier, as your example says. I used DPS in my statement because it's pretty much synonymous with equipment tier.
---
Within one tier, higher top-end damage is still important and might be the deciding factor, but we're going to to a level of detail where also stuff like stats on the weapon, racial perks and weapon talents become a consideration. Ranking weapons strictly by top-end damage is therefore a bit iffy.
---
yes very helpful. Yes it helps feeding your pet. better quality food means better loyalty gains.
---
Well /u/Revalent , I will happily be considered a douchebag by you in order to not have to wait in queues. Especially since you'll have no idea who I am inside the game.
---
Yup, same here.
---
I'm looking forward to it, but Im not excited or hyped.
---
Just, O, thats nice.
---
Can't speak to speed leveling but I would imagine it is negligible with farming. Remember, Orcs get +5% pet damage, which is good for farming. And most importantly, they get 25% stun resist. If you're on a PvP server, getting wrecked by a rogue in stealth is going to slow down your farming way more than the troll racial DPS increase will speed it up. I'm 100% rolling Orc for my PvP server Hunter.
---
He thought they did, but they didn't.
---
I'd rather have another repetitive layering-thread than cosplay-crap all day of the week.
---
These masses you speak of, which full realm do you think they'll be rolling on?
---
Its funny how unit frame addons can spoiler all this things because i had aguf that show me creature type, so Chromie was a dragon, this guy also [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8479/kalaran-windblade](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8479/kalaran-windblade)
---
You can try oceanic realms, the time may line up. I work the night shift in Aus and haven’t a snowballs chance in hell of finding a guild. 
---
I’ll be raiding weekends in gold dkp runs most likely.
---
I do.  I can play for hours and hours. Time killer to make cool features.    Never ends I have to move on.  I get addicted and no focusing on important things.   
---
Work late.  Big family to share time. It’s an escape.
---
Except there are way more elements towards the fact we did land on the moon.
---
I'd recommend going to one of the ET servers, people tend to raid later on in the day so wrapping up before 11 would fit your schedule better.
---
What does immersion do?
---
I also never enjoyed the idea of letting me pet do most of the work. I leveled MM and it was no problem at all. BM IS faster, but MM has absolutely no problems and the difference was minimal, MM does more damage to cancel out most of the BM perks. You do you, it's all viable.
---
His entire party adds 15 fps.
---
I hope you’re right. With the amount of layers we’re gonna need tho I don’t see recognising names to be much of a thing for a while. Definitely agree tho, community is the best thing that’s coming back with Classic.
---
Carnivore is the way to go for focus and steady energy. You do bulletproofs?
---
&gt; But I've actually gone ahead and changed the addon.
---
You must have known someone would change it back :)
---
https://github.com/EmpressSteak/PersonalShopper
---
This a really good point, the realms may be packed now, but that’s partially because anyone with an active subscription for retail is given the opportunity. Whether they actually play for a long period of time is unknown, but they’d rather save their names now and just have it for when they need it.
---
I know I’m in the minority here, but I honestly think Blizzard has some clue as to what they’re doing. Everyone is this sub loves classic, so obviously to us, there’s no reason it won’t be crammed to the gills. But Blizzard does have years of data on player habits, and they’d rather Classic be a cash cow then shoot themselves in the foot and set it up for failure. 
---
Mind you, they have already released new realms, nothing is stopping them from adding more anytime they find necessary.
---
BC was way better than vanilla.
---
You don’t need to wait any seconds. Warrior tanks open with death wish and get ahead in threat and don’t lose it. Warriors don’t need TF to produce massive amount of threat with all the knowledge of dual wield fury tanking that exists. And i mean a difference between bosses with threat drops and losing agro to just straight dps
---
Nothing good comes easy

Embrace the grind

Gnomish engineering brings you back a couple of years.....

beast slaying is very helpful if your smart, take skinning and spend time grinding beasts. the salt flats in thousand needles is one of my fave places and you can grab 5 levels there very easy while enough gold for your mounts by vendering the leather of what you kill. Beserk is a decent racial and so is the bow spec while leveling. i

---
That's every server and trust me no one will like you if you are toxic towards those that haven't played it as seen on the last stress test
---
Really? That's interesting to me. So is it that you enjoy beating other people to know it's? Or is it because like you said goals for yourself on how much do collect per session or something? Like do you make a game out of it for yourself?
---
Errr, no?
---
There are only three staves with agility. One is a green reward from Hogger, another is a level 27 green, the last one was never implemented into the game (was supposed to be a Druid quest reward).
---
There are no staves that give critical hit (Except Lohk).
---
There are no staves with attack power (except Lohk... vs demons).
---
There are no staves that give chance to hit.
---
-----------
---
I guess if you are going a meme "Arcane Hunter" build, focusing on buffing Serpent Sting and Arcane Shot, you would theoretically be after Spell Power, but there are realistically no good leveling staves.
---
And they said we didn't want it...
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Theres room for everyone. If you want world firsts or hardcore raiding or rank 14 you will not get it  but you still can have tons of fun by being a casual. I was and hardcore back in vanilla, and now I simply can't, got wife and 2 kids. So I will play with the time I have. 
---
I do encourage you to try.
---
Would every layer be a container running in a Kubernetes cluster to enable scaling? I’m just starting as data engineer and am wondering about their setup..
---
Did I hurt your e feelings? Ok then go back to LOTRO
---
Im pretty sure im on the same quest. I think i also want to play with the more mature server that played Vanilla too. When I join a guild like i feel more at home so i dont feel like a lonewolf
---
jealousy* FTFY

I had chills all over my body

Fucking casual.

oh fuck! i suddenly remember all those pages i will have to find. totally forgot about that. hated it on every character. can't wait!
---
That Vanilla trailer Dwarf man..
---
This is slightly disingenuous in that, yes there was no armoury site.  However there was a way to look up chars over level 10 that were in guilds and get moderate information about them.  For example their level, class, pvp rank and I think things like honourable kill numbers etc.
---
I know this because back in the day blizzard had this site and it was xml/xsl xpath based so I used to scrape the data for use in an irc chat bot where users could do !charname to look them up on the server I played at the time.
---
How are boars as a pet? The charge seems really useful while leveling and for pvp.
---
M+ says hi
---
I advise you not to take leatherworking. Its tempting, espec cos skinning is SO good for a hunter, but LW is a trap. theres nothing good your gonna get from it and its a gold sink. better to put the time into engineering ( get the ore/bars from a miner alt or buy it from ah with the gold you made vendering leather).
---
That's news to me! Will have to look it up, thanks!
---
Welp, at least this means that you'll get your mount 1/3 of your way into levelling (assuming you will have the monies by then).
---
rip Zeth'kur
---
I played there, Zeth was very unique compared to other vanilla private servers in a sense that it was the leftover server... Casuals making up 95%+ of the population. People were generally really bad at the game.
---
Felt like playing retail vanilla.
---
Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Been going to tournaments for Smash since 2015, may as well keep playing a little longer.
---
Actually I don‘t think PvE realms will be so much better. They will probably be better. But not by magnitudes.
---
This is the worst kind of gatekeeping. So glad you're on EU and not NA.
---
That's called a guild and every server will have something like what you're requesting. You just have to find it.
---
Joke?
---
Classic is not about the "quick fix" or LFG tool kinda ppl.
---
I mean even drop chances for quest items are so low that ppl like you will go insane over it.
---
I for myself will enjoy the deceleration **ALOT**!! Actually way more of a **R**PG as retail. Nowadays its more of a MMOPG.
---
This confuses me the cross realm LFG is considered one of the main things that destroyed the community so why is everyone fine with cross realm bgs?
---
!remindme 4 months

Ascension Project WoW Private server, you drop loot when you die and create your own class. Kind of clunky and stuff, but hey, it passes the time!
---
I worded it poorly. I didn't necessarily find it daunting. I'm just not sure on what I should be going for, other than quests. I'm never certain on what I should be working towards other than progressing, which is what I don't know how to do efficiently. The best advice would probably be just to play, but yeah.
---
I appreciate the reply. That helped

I just bind pet attack to a mouse button, like a side one. Hitting it again disengages. No macro needed.

Can't speak for Tauren but as a nelf I won 99% of rogue duels because standing dead center of a flare you can't be touched. I'm aware Tauren have a larger hit box though so ymmv. The 1% of rogue duels I lost? I made mistakes, it wasn't a particularly good rogue. You just have all the tools to counter them if you know they are coming. Even if they get a big opener on you, if you survive the stunlock you can still win with the right talents.

Because tourists don't play private servers. Hardcore WoW players do. Those don't drop off. And they are a tiny population. The most populated private servers are like 5000.

I cannot believe that people think a massive amount of people will play wow classic. After a few months we are going to see a mass exodus.

Well, they tend to fill slower since people want to play on PvP realms for the most part. So I expect that during Launch day there will be room for people on PvE realms. Queues are going to be a thing for sure, but I'm talking about general realm availability since past a certain population cap, realm character creation becomes locked for new players.
---
Thx, could be, I'll try to find some statement from Blizzard
---
So what would drop in Outland? And if Outland is tuned so that only Naxx raiders can go there, how many people will pay for it?
---
Cant you hear us boii, nobody wants to play Retail? You can earn 12 euro at a dishwashing job in 1h. So it's not worth it.
---
Have you played a pserver recently? Mechanically it's not really that different from retail(I'm talking how movement feels, how the engine feels, combat, etc). It's not like the 1.12 is a clunky mess while current retail is polished perfection; running around and hitting hotkeys to attack mobs is basically still the same mechanically.
---
There are a few adjustments to make if you're coming from retail, but it's nothing major and most people won't notice after an hour of playing.
---
I've played p1999 and pservers for 1.12, and they're not even comparable when it comes to outdated clunky mechanics.
---
Yeah the dungeon finder isn't all bad. Perhaps it should have been limited to leveling and old dungeons? So people leveling alts can more easily find groups and just get through them. But heroics and the like in the present content require manual grouping and travel. Mythic dungeons try to do that but they're faceroll until M+10 or so.
---
They could even do a FFXIV and have a leveling dungeon queue where you get scaled down if you're at max level, and rewarded with some decent gold and materuals. The next modern patch appears to be bringing in a player scaling system for playing with lower level friends but it seems very limited.
---
so basically, we're living in a poorly designed MMORPG whose devs have no idea what the players actually want
---
It feels like they tried to make it like the more popular games out there now with only four to five abilities that you have to cycle through, as well as forcing a talent spec to be viable in PvE or PvP.
---
Regarding Moonkin melee: this is theorized as a possible solution to mana issues (proccing omen) However in your scenario (90sec fight) mana doesn't really become an issue, so better sticking with whatever the best Moonkin spec is.
---
Absolut Vanilla guys!
---
No. The balance of retail has homogenized every class. A feral is just a cat rogue. A rogue is just a leather fury warrior, and so on. There is no differences. I am saying that I want differences and uniqueness without denying certain specs about 50% of the content of the game.
---
I don't think Id have to fortitude to grind through hundreds of hours of gameplay before getting to the parts I enjoy. So yeah, you might have the wrong mindset for classic. Sucking at lower levels and every slight power up actually mattering, contesting nodes and not having everything handed to you are the reason people are so hyped for classic.

I have to disagree, memes are the good filler content when there is something to discuss, but not enough for a fulls page worth everyday. Memes keep people engaged when there isnt a whole load of stuff going on.

Overwatch Reddit is a big offender of this where they've restricted so much content that 95% of the posts are POTG clips and 5% discussion if there is a patch coming out. It's such a boring Reddit because of it and it's hard to engage with it.

I won’t be surprised if all of these medium pop servers end up being high or even full by the time launch day comes. So many people aren’t rolling characters until day of or the night before.

Game is like food. You don't want your food served cold. Yet it's not like the hotter it is, the better. Food can be too hot. Of couse, people can prefer their food more or less hot, but there are certain thresholds when majority would say: "ok now its too hot".

With games, they can be either too hardcore or too casual to enjoy. Old MMOs were too hardcore. Current WoW is too casual. Original WoW? It seems it hit the sweet spot.

WoW sorta tries that. I believe Protadin has a PvP talent that makes their taunt inflict a damage taken increase debuff. It starts at 5% and increases up to 15% if the paladin keeps attacking them.
---
Unfortunately tanks in PvP continue to either be utterly useless or utterly broken. Blizzard keeps trying to make them a DPS but with more health then get surprised when a protwarr can steamroll BGs. They then get hastily nerfed to the ground. Honestly the main issue is that besides being harder to kill they don't bring anything unique. Healers already have defensive stuff covered and DPS all have crowd control out of the ass. So what's a tank supposed to contribute to a PvP fight besides sitting on a flag in Arathi all game?
---
I had a lot of fun as a Protadin in arenas at one point but then we got nerfed and I had to go back to Ret.
---
If your reference point is private servers know that those made thing intentionally harder. They even nerfed the base mana pool.

Mobs after 10 start getting more dangerous, before that it's kinda easy which is expected for starting zones.

This is entirely due to incompetince on Blizzards part.  There is no way you can blame people for wanting to stay put for a multitude of reasons, including what notsingsing mentioned.

Steve Jobs said it best, once the marketing team controls a companies decisions, it goes to shit.  The fact that people arn't even more upset with how this was handled is mind boggling.

There's a battleground that's vaguely like Huttball, the MoP one where you can throw the orbs to people. The brawl version with only one or two balld is closer to the idea but the scoring system is of course way different.
---
There can be so many things on an expansion pack loot table that don't invalidate old content. Rare/Epic BoEs, new reputation loot, new crafting materials, items that make old raid content easier, new progression mats (for new spells, skill ranks, enchantments, etc...). You can have "lateral itemization" content updates for the normal zones, and then high-end post-Naxx content for raiders all in the same new areas.
---
Outland itself doesn't need to require attunement because the "attunement" is a server event, I was suggesting maybe dungeons or raids.
---
The concept is pretty simple, an expansion could just follow as a normal phase or content patch would. Classic WoW Phase 6 doesn't make phase 1-5 content obsolete, right? So why is it necessary that a hypothetical phase 7 or 8 cannot do the same?
---
Playing that stress test is one of the worst things I could have done because this has been the longest 2 weeks of my life. My arse has been making buttons waiting on this being released!
---
Aye too much layering and some shitty corporate decisions are the two things that could make this game fail. There will be a drop off at some point and then a stabilisation, but to think this minimal server count we got will be dead in a year is absurd. Classic levelling is far more compelling than retail and will have a far higher player retention as a result.
---
Haha totally worth for wow classic

Legion was a very successful expansion though overshadowed by the expansion of BFA where they took everything they learned from Legion and threw it in a dumpster then set it on fire and tried to fix the dumpster fire but sadly all the good things were destroyed.

Necrosis-Classic seem to not work when using Git, gets stuck after downloading and placing it in the addons folder. Possibly due to the way the addon author has structured the release?
---
It works fine through curseforge, where it isn't inside of an extra folder.
---
The fresh economy is half the reason I am so hyped for this game, I look forward to actually getting a chance at getting rich in comparison to others. Everyone will be broke at launch, and tokens aren’t a thing, which makes this a completely unique second chance in the official wow history.
---
No I haven’t played LOTRO actually but that sounds pretty cool!
---
Yeah, I’m wondering how I should do it too, maybe you could change up your faction and try a new class (what I’m going to do, although for the life of me I can’t figure what I want, currently thinking a rogue haha)
---
Also if you haven’t - check out the rp/rp-pvp servers, I’m planning on going grobbulus and the community (reddit and discord) is already something I’m falling in love with!
---
I understand that we (as the group of fans) know that Classic is great and we know exactly what we're signing up for, but there are a lot of folks out there that have no idea. They're just gonna jump in blind because Bob and Jill told them that it's amazing.
---
For example, I know 4 people that will be playing at launch and I'm about 99% positive that 3 of them will quit shortly after. I've gone through this with them so many times, they just jump from hype train to hype train too quickly. They have zero attention span to stick with a game long term even if it's good. I'm sure there are plenty more like my 3 friends.

This is badass dude! I wish I had the cash to throw around to make a WoW lair, I’m Jealous as fuck. Hope you have a ripper of a time playing classic on this rig :)
---
I remember it being damn difficult to get enough resources to craft or get enough gold to buy pots for raids. I gotta say I was a student back then so I had lots of time and still it was difficult/time consuming.
---
What I also did not like was nobody wanted melees in raids. I was a rogue back then and a good one at that but still I‘d basically have to beg my guild to take me.
---
Bosses dropped like 2 items and they were the same damn useless items nobody wanted for 4 months in a row.
---
The raid leaders would explain an encounter for an hour and there‘d always be those two people who would manage to do exactly that what they were not supposed to do.

Basically they said target medium is the old full. 
---
Large ques
---
&gt; Also it favors people subbed to bfa, who may not be as interested in playing classic a other people who quit wow 
---
You mean that blizzard is giving priority to their current paying customers, that non-subbed people interested in getting the ability to get names can pay half a sub for, showing both their intent to play, as well as Blizzard paying respects to the people who stuck with the modern game. 
---
&gt; For example, making it only available to people with battle net account with some games on it. 
---
While there is some positives to this idea, you're ultimately opening up people who play overwatch and black ops 4 to making characters and taking up slots in blizzards population metrics, and then never end up playing anyway. 
---
&gt; That would give them a much better idea of how many people will play, 
---
I'm not seeing it. I could see it as an indication of how many people *entertain the idea* of playing, but saying nothing about who will be there at launch. Classic and BFA will be a shared sub, so Blizzard are obligated to make space for everyone who plays modern WoW, and can make enough servers to accommodate those BFA players who reserve names, at least as far as launch is concerned.
---
If someone not subbed wants to reserve a specific name so badly, they can pay 6 bucks to get their name, and as such inform Blizzard to make space for them server-wise. If someone hates the idea of paying 6 extra bucks to blizzard before they play classic, they can wait until launch day. What is so bad about this? Its probably one of the most least intrusive forms of monetization in modern games, its not a cash grab, as you'll still be able to play, maybe just not with the name you want. Its like Blizzard is supposed to not be a company all of the sudden.

You don't actually have a fiscal responsibility to shareholders, that's a myth.

Pretty sure I just used  [Carapace Spine Crossbow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18738/carapace-spine-crossbow) right up until I procured Rhok.

Unless you are a Hybrid class that wants to start building up gear and preparing for their main spec.

E.g. Enhancement is optimum for leveling but if you plan on healing might be worthwhile switching to Resto/Ele.
---
Oh fuck he got me with that reacharound :(
---
Im pretty sure Blizzard is underestimating how many people are gonna play. If they think that the name reservation is a clue, they couldnt be more wrong. I know several people who dosnt have a subscribtion, incl. my self. They are waiting to a closer date to the launch, before they sign up. You end up losing half a month subscribtion, just for the name reservation, wich is stupid. The name isnt that important.
---
Are you coming from 2035 damn..
---
I'd argue that current wow isn't actually too casual, it's just too monetized. It definitely nails the casual/hardcore balance but the game systems implemented all have some sort of "engagement" mechanic to keep people playing. The azerite grind, infinite scaling on m+, warforge/gemsocket/benthic gear.(I don't mind the mythic scaling personally it's just an example)
---
Oh well that's what retail is all about these days isn't it? Grindy grind to keep people occupied! ;)

---
I always skip this, what’s the reward for completing ?
---
I was in the same boat as you until this post by Blizzard.  I planned on waiting till the day before release to sign up, but with this news i was afraid that they might lock out new characters created on the server, so i resubbed a little early.  Quite a few IRL and private server friends had already chosen Herod and arnt moving and im not playing without them. Blizzard fucked up!
---
I sincerely doubt it would have been a huge risk for launch day. There will be a lot of people making their new characters on launch who will not sign up for a  full/locked realm with a long queue. So in short term, I believe it would have worked well.
---
In long term however, there would have been a small risk that one of the servers would die due to low population. Assuming that server gets a lot of tourist that play for a little while before giving up and either quitting or going back to retail. I pressume this is what Blizzard feared and has affected their actions. A reasonable idea, but the wrong one.

oh just a ps, theres a number of compromises in that build I feel I should point out: No trap mastery or surefooted due to insufficient talent points for surv. Inability to reach frenzy or spirit bond in BM due to lack of free talent points for BM. necessity to take hawk eye due to pvp requirements when they would be better spent within the BM tree for damage and/or quality of life. Desire to drop top 8 Bm talents for surv talents for pvp compromised by the damage that it would do to the specs pve viability.
---
Conclusion: OP would be better served by defining exact pve requirements and considering making this hunter either a raid hunter or a pvp hunter and making another (perhaps hunter, 2 hunters isnt unrealistic) alt for solo farming purposes.

---
&gt; Why is WoW Classic getting a lot of hype? 
---
The reason legacy servers been been asked for for a very long time has to do with a few factors. Originally I think people just wanted them because with each expension the previous expansions content pretty much became worthless and the only way to actually do them as they were was to return to the version of the game that content existed in because throughout versions of the game there's a lot of changes to how classes function like new talents, old ones getting reworked, the over all base stats change, new stats get introduced. It all adds up to where even if you  decided you were just gonna stop at level 60 in say BC and do a vanilla raid, it wouldn't play the same as it did in vanilla because of the core changes introduced in BC. 
---
Later on, many felt the game was changed so drastically with the introduction of Catalcysm which was shown in their since declining playerbase as a result of the game at its very core no longer being reflective of what World of Warcraft was and where it came from it ended up more becoming a plea of desperation as Blizzard took the game in a new direction and veterans of the game wanted to be able to keep playing the game they fell in love with. The only way to do this however was on illegal servers which Blizzard regularly made lawsuits against to shut down all the while refusing the provide a legacy option themselves which was asked for repeatadly to a point where a list of reasons why they weren't going to do it were compiled and pasted to anyone who asked for them on the official forums. Long story short, the most popular illegal server was shut down and met with mass backlash from many, many players which resulted in a petition and support from very popular content creators who play or used to play WoW and even ex WoW developers. 
---
&gt;What are the benefits of this which don't appear in the actual WoW: BFA? 
---
This is impossible for me to answer for you because this is wholy subjective. I can tell you why I personally prefer vanilla variants of WoW over modern and why I stopped playing modern. My reasoning doesn't mean you'll enjoy Classic yourself.
---
&gt; If I was to buy a subscription for WoW in the coming week, should I start off with WoW: BFA or play through WoW Classic? 
---
I think it's best to do things in chronological order, but I often don't end up doing that myself. Why not play modern for say 2 weeks and Classic for 2 weeks? Decide which you like most then, or even if it's both of em. Your sub gives you access to both modern and Classic.
---
&gt; What are some general knowledge tips or advice I should know about the game? 
---
Umm, there's not a whole lot to give really, it's something you kinda just have to play and experience for yourself. I went into WoW not knowing much about it either, my friends just kept telling me to play it. I had an idea of the vague discriptions they gave me and that was it. I will say one thing though, that a lot of games today just don't have. Your interactions with people on your server matter. They're not just someone you don't have to worry about ever seeing again if you're an asshat. At some point you will need the help of others, you wanna build connections. Be helpful and nice, you'd be amazed at what that can lead to later. I'll even give you my own story. I was PvPing in Arathi Highlands one day and I saw this lowbie who was trying to kill some Ogres in one of the caves. I helped him out for probably a good hour then went on my way. When that guy eventually hit cap, I was looking for someone to give me an enchant, and that same guy saw my name and told me he'd be more than happy to do it free to repay me. After that, whenever I needed and enchant, he was my guy. Little things like that, you'll be dicking around somewhere and all the sudden that guy you gave 2 gold to a week ago just whispered you to ask if you wanna fill the spot they're missing in their raid. You end up joining their guild and before you know it, this guild of people are you best friends. Not gonna find that in modern, or any modern game for that matter.
---
&gt; Is there anything bad I should look out for when playing this? 
---
Literally any game; there's gonna be people who are gonna be assholes to you and give you shit for anything and everything simply because...they're dicks. Don't even give them the time of day, they're not worth letting ruin the game for yea, put em on ignore, go back to having fun. If that means dropping a group, or even maybe getting kicked from one, you'll find another one soon enough who won't be a bunch of pricks. Honestly, I've played a lot of games, and WoW is probably by far one of the least toxic games, even though people love complaining about how toxic it is. Of any game, I've experienced the least number of problems with people in WoW. Once you're in a guild things become a hell of a lot better. I recall once in Wrath several of our guild mates joined a pug, during it someone bitched about my DPS despite it not really being that bad, my guild was quick to tell the dude to eat a dick and we dropped to find a new pug. There's a lot of assholes out there, but believe me it's worth sticking around and finding some really amazing people too.

I rocked Rhok n' Lok until BC hit and I was still topping meters in AQ40, even Patchwerk (my guild was giving up around Naxx like most so that's as far as I got). Yeah Ash was technically better but not so much as to make you outdated without it. I loved the look of Rhok, I don't think I'd have given it up even if Ash had ever dropped for me.

That’s because xp/hr would be a so much more work, you’d have to do it per class and assume you’re in the most optimal areas and taking the most optimal forms of travel, have the best spec and have the best gear.

Ideally I want most DMG from pet but if that's significantly weaker (lower damage) compared to a build focused on the hunter DMG then I'm ok with pet as utility as well. I don't think you're saying if I want pet DMG then don't PvP? I want pve to be the focus but can still PvP decently well so if I have to prioritize then it will be pve over PvP. I'm new to the game so I'm not sure what the difference is between raid and dungeon but I like group pve not solo farming.
---
Thanks for the detailed response again!
---
What math are you using as layer cap? Is the sever capable of housing 50k? 100k? 200k?
---
exactly what i think. THe talk about tourists is bullshit.Even if you max your main and fully gear him. You can and probably will always make alts to max up next.
---
Oh just stfu. Of course people are going to take it. A huge amount of players is quite casual. They'd much rather switch server than having to sit in a 3 hour queue. Just because you won't, doesn't mean NOBODY will. Plenty of people would use such services, just like people used it in 2005.
---
Details! will be your best option for Classic.
---
Nostalgia is a factor, but it’s only when it comes to wow that nostalgia can be used as a cuss word, a way to shrug it off - used by the many players attached to their retail accounts decade worth of progression.
---
The reality is this: the game is amazing, with or without nostalgia. It’s gameplay is captivating, it’s design fosters comraderie and community. There’s a reason vanilla WoW is argue-ably The video game with the biggest pop culture impact of all time (outside of gamer communities).
---
The video is also spot on. The dungeons are all made with such care and absolute genius. I can’t imagine skipping them. Honestly I may talk my friends into doing a horde DM run.
---
Just a fun thing. Back at the WoW start, they added more realms cause the queues was large on some of them. So i decided to go for one of the new realms. Some years later(i think) the realm i played on, had to be merged with another because of lack of players.
---
a sense of pride and accomplishment. 
---
wait...wrong game sorry.
---
Whole link, or that doesn't work here like that? xD
---
Yes, 20 days of played, not 20 days IRL.
---
Not possible yet.
---
The ElvUI developers have said that MobHealth integration will come at a later point.
---
&gt;Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006. 
---
It will be fine. You can pick literally any server and you won't have population issues for a good while after launch.
---
No, US servers are just as slammed.
---
hellofa job
---
So you're agreeing with me?
---
That company is so fucking strange. They have hired top tier people and have been going for years now and there is nothing coming out about what they are doing.

I still play BFA and its currently to waste my time till I can play classic.
---
classic should have had old models
---
Ferals' bleeds only became worthy to use by default when wotlk hit. Both vanilla and TBC feral were the same, shred spam into ferocious bite as finisher while doing the powershifting trick (and abusing wolfshead helm, BiS until T6). 
---
AoE? Druid has hurricane (and can be backed up with a +damage set and buffs), pally has consecration (depends on build, though), even shammies have chain lightning+magma totem (and again, enh should have a +damage setup to back it up).
---
Dumping aggro? Neither warriors nor locks have aggro dumps, did you see someone considering their viability out of it?
---
You're the one who's clueless and close-minded.

Happy cake day my friend!

On a scale of 1 to 10, how uncomfortable is it to look or actually make proper use of the monitor that's hung up on that weird angle on top OP?
---
I've seen Midsommar. I'd rather be in 10k queue
---
I like your setup man!
---
BigWigs already has a working Classic version, so I'd be surprised if LittleWigs doesn't get one aswell.
---
My guild wont be doing any stockpiling, we want more than 1 scarab lord thx. Also, time and bag space isn't infinite, other phases will have their stuff to farm.
---
Hope it brings good memories of your father back to you mate. Rest In Peace
---
Here's what I'm thinking is going to happen.
---
Classic is the last hurrah for the WoW MMORPG. They'll release TBC and WotLK in the next 3 years. Maybe one last expansion for retail to tie some things up. But it'll be all about going back to the roots for one last time with Classic/TBC/WotLK, kind of a "thank you" to the fans for playing WoW for 15+ years. 
---
Blizzard will then announce a Diablo MMO either this year or next at Blizzcon. Because I don't think they can go back to retail WoW for much longer after Classic lands.
---
Manastorm Leggings, Flamewaker Legplates, Salamander Scale Pants
---
"pants" is even in the name!
---
Right, I mean they had to die the first time to die again!
---
LG 34uc88-b
---
Legit, if you haven't made a friend by level 10 just from being in the world I'd be very surprised.  Classic forces social interaction, and even something as simple as buffing other players, or helping them when they pull an extra mobs etc can lead to conversations.
---
I love this!
---
Upvoted. I'm planning to get my 60 till ~ November 2020
---
No reasons to rush
---
I'm scared that I mistake my poop sock with my jizz sock, would be not cool
---
You can achieve a 1:1 result with ElvUI in Classic.

16 silver for a stack of 200, could fill a quiver for less than 3 gold. That's 3600 arrows. It lasts a loooong time. I always purchased mine from the inn in IF.

It looks beautiful. Well done to you guys.

Good that I'm not alone :)

The reason they’re not in the gehennas discord is because some of them have been kicked from there.

Clearly, it's just watercooled for shits n' gigs m8.

You can use WeakAuras to display custom art panels in Classic.
---
Enjoy what you want to enjoy, but don’t mislead people. Marks is MUCH slower than BM.
---
I can imagine looking up all the time will get tiring.
---
Fuck me

There is no special monitor stand. The bottom monitor is on its standard stand while the top monitor is wall mounted and I put the Webcam between them.
---
The fine print at the bottom is a little hard to read due to the background.

Is there any difference between nm.reddit.com and reddit.com with the new css?

Holy SHIT this is a well-produced video

no

I like the fact that he has Warlords of Draenor behind him saying this. Nonetheless, he summoned his inner courage, suppressed his Pride, and gave us the Classic WoW Announcement. Funny huh, i got chills just by writing Classic WoW there ;)!
---
Then the account deserves a ban.
---
Jizz sock?  You neanderthal.  It is all about the cum box.
---
Or it could be the best time of your life...
---
It was introduced in [Patch 1.12](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0).  The problem was ghost realms had 1hr+ queues and could never get a BG that was not during their realm’s peak hours. 
---
I think they’ll have plenty of time to make a decision here, as BGs aren’t coming until Phase 3.
---
yes, the site that nobody could spell or remember
---
Yeah, but have you seen Midsommar?
---
And everyone stops dpsing and leader gets mad as fuck when you wipe. I intend to queue premade with a healer to make sure if someone does this. They just stop healing.

What things on top display?

Oh, it looked like a 2 monitor stand with a hinge between them, and thats exactly what i needet. Really nice setup!

People also forget that a lot of the zones that did have quests in that range were SIGNIFICANTLY more bare-bones. Badlands was a complete mess with most of the quests involving outside the zone and requiring random items to complete them. Swamp of Sorrows and Azshara were very desolate. Tanaris was the only major zone that did a lot of work in that level range and with the neutral quest hub, it's no surprise people ended up killing each other there. Thankfully things become a lot more cohesive in the 50-60 range with Winterspring, WPL, EPL, and Un'goro.

Is shit hot? Asking for a friend
---
5. I mean I only use it for reading twitch chat or changing music. But there is no way you could use it to watch videos.
---
Oh i though u post it cause of that hahaha
---
You realize this post is a joking poke at how much they're looking forward to classic right? :P
---
I have the same issue though tbh. I had done a great job keeping it out of my mind and not getting super hyped, but as soon as I woke up to do name reservation I went to the stratosphere and immediately had to go roll on a private server to get a pvp fix until classic launch.
---
Can you run it fullres though?
---
Gonna be hard to balance females irl
---
I've said this several times a month ago to people and got downvoted for not doing my part and subbing to test the beta.
---
Come play alliance on zandalar tribe:) me and my friends are playing there! And no we don’t rp even tho it’s an rp realm. Rp realms just have another ambience to it
---
except that everything's out of focus relative to its resolution
---
Oh, it looked like a 2 monitor stand with a hinge between them. Really nice setup!

You are correct in that a decade is always ten years, but I have to nitpick a little:
---
There is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar. December 31st 1BC was followed by January 1st 1AD. The first decade ended on December 31st 10AD.
---
[We are currently in the third millennium and the 21st century, which began on January 1st **2001**. The *year 2000 was the last year of the second millennium* and the 20th century.](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/millennium.php)

Everyone having short "meaningful" words for names sure gonna look silly..
---
But his speed run is 4 days 20 hr, while Classic is 10 days away?
---
As I am playing on a German realm I hope that not too many people people are choosing to use it. But you might be right.
---
Yeah, me and my group of Brits are rolling on Golemagg too.
---
I definitely wouldn't pay $200 for a machine with a C2D and a GPU that's pretty much on par with integrated ones. Seriously, I tried giving several for free and I failed, had to recycle them eventually :D

Something like this would actually check all the boxes – it's fairly recent, cheap, has decent graphics performance for less demanding games and you can always bring the price down a bit if you shop around for a cheaper case or ditch the HDD if you don't need it. ;)
---
Theres only a few items you lose by switching, the teleport to gadgetzan and the world enlarger etc.
---
ok well that really makes it easier to help you. Raid dps is a min maxed marks build. You gotta understand that your pet will die in a raid if you send it to attack. theres just too much aoe/conal boss attacks and healers wont heal your pet. Mend pet will never be enough and you wont have the mana to keep reviving it. When you raid you will bring a wolf pet and it will be on passive by your side the whole time. You manually activate furious howl for the buff and thats it. If your raiding with pvp as a side, we gonna be ripping all those points from bm for the surv talents we really want and trueshot aura. 
---
 If your rolling with the pet as your main source of dps you need beast disc IMO. frenzy you can live without.  " I don't think you're saying if I want pet DMG then don't PvP? " Im saying you have a choice: pet damage, personal range damage, good pvp skills:- pick TWO. 
---
 If your in a dung you can roll whatever (decent) spec you like. BM leveling spec is fine for dungs. Raids? no. If your not going to raid though... Can I interest you in a full on SURV pvp spec? suboptimal for group pve play, but not by anything that anyone will notice if your not trying to raid with it.
---
It gave me the biggest hook in gaming \_ever\_
---
The story and the leveling is so well designed in classic, you can really feel the difference almost from level to level, from gear to gear. It is hard to describe if you ever played an MMORPG.
---
Try it :&gt;      "...i'm your pusher." dum dumdum dumm dumm
---
Darnit I believe I threw away a Q6600 and a GT8800 very recently when moving.
---
I wonder if eminem plays WoW
---
hard pass
---
I've not tested it but this looks like it'll work for classic.  Thanks.
---
I’m 35. Game came out in 2006. Means you were 21 or 22 when it came out. You weren’t a teenager.. just in case you forgot
---
Who the hell are Apes?  Red is dead man, guild names are for tombstones
---
There's a blue post regarding damage a while back where they compared their 1.12 reference client to the Beta and it was exactly the same. So yes, it is exactly the same as Vanilla.
---
No they didn't because you can only create a maximum of 3 characters/names across all servers.
---
How’s wow on ultra wide? I want one so bad but idk man
---
I remember me and some other people being put on Vurtne hunting duty when that happened 😁
---
I never said otherwise. What I said is that Warden detecting that AHK is running is not enough to flag your account. I've been running AHK on my machine for over a decade and have never once had any sort of warning from Blizzard, even when using scripts that do things in-game. There are numerous Blue posts explaining that AHK is fine, just not everything you can do with AHK is fine.
---
Fixed now :D
---
*cries in Shazz*
---
When  I think Hunter, I think Dwarf with a gun just like in that original trailer. Are guns viable in WoW? Are they so much worse than bows/xbows that high level pve/pvp will be impossible?
---
I would be happy if i can find 10 hours without sacrificing family time or sleep time..
---
That's not real, there is no Fortunate Son playing in the Background
---
See you on Lucifron Bruda :D
---
Ackhschiually it came out in 2004.
---
Retail wow. Though it feels more like a waste of time than wow has ever done.
---
Stay in Gehennas?
---
It's really addicting.
---
I agree
---
\&gt;&gt; No you reserved names, not spots. You've no more right to a place on that server than anybody else.   
---
a name and a spot are the same thing. it is one player character in a finite number of available spots.  
---
\&gt;&gt; Why is you think you've more right to the server? Because you setup a subscription first?   
---
yes, this is why they should play there over someone who wasn't subbed and came in late. Because they were in the group that filled the realm.  
---
aint no difference to me, arugal best realm. it is dumb to see a full realm and go yer i dont care that its full, im going to go there anyway. yall dumb
---
Launch day: OOH BOY , can't wait to play after waiting for months. Server full, server full. You've been placed into que estimate time 10 hours
---
a big buton.. sure :')
---
The fate of every video game sub is the constant screen shot and meme garbage. I've subbed to one gaming sub and won't sub to another for a long time.
---
Pretty much this. Don't have a wife or family, don't plan on getting one.  
---
Classic launch is going to be bueno.
---
TBC Dungeon finder was actually excellent. It didn't automatically group players, you just selected what you were interested in and could add a note advertising your spec or anything you wanted to mention.
---
Expecting people to read more than 5 lines on Reddit? What dream world are you from :P. Anyway thanks for the read
---
I have a huge appreciation for Mark Kern. But what he said here wasn't a big revelation. It's all well known. Some normies will get enlightened by his tweets and that's it. This knowledge will never hit mainstream, because casual audience don't have time to do the research. And you can be sure big companies like Epic spend a lot of money so this knowledge doesn't become mainstream.
---
Honestly I liked to old look way more. Dont get me wrong this new thing looks fine and is well made, but I'm kinda the no changes guy and think the old style fitted vanilla more.
---
August 28th? You late to the party ?
---
Nice vid btw :)
---
I'm not crying. You're crying.
---
&gt; higher skill ceiling
---
now that's some creative use of space, not sure how comfortable it would be too look up at this angle.
---
I mean it all looks so not lived in, inauthentic, sterile. Everything is put in its place, God forbid you touch it and disturb any of it. You're meant to use the thing, not pretend it's some kind of decoration.
---
I’m also CST and working a 7 day on 7 day off 20:00-6:00 schedule. Similar dilemma as you, where I don’t know what server to pick
---
Brilliant video - love the mage not being able to hold on how much damn damage she can do - SO true
---
I don’t know why people keep thinking blizzard are underestimating the numbers. They are a multi-million dollar company who have been doing this stuff for years. It’s not run (contrary to what people want to believe) by a bunch of idiots. 
---
They are clearly taking a cautious approach to adding realms to avoid ending up with dead realms a few weeks after launch. 
---
If they had launched the game with just 2 PvP realms then I would be just as critical as anyone else. But that’s not the case.
---
Consider yourself corrected
---
Asked to join Zul’farrak group. Me a NE Warrior. No idea what a tank is. We pull first group. Wipe. No shield. Everyone leaves. I’m left scratching my head.
---
you can slowfall from a weird area by climbing the ironforge mountain too, unless that's changed in the classic client
---
A legendary story that me and my mates still talk about:
---
A game of Alterac Valley... it had gone on for.. I don't know how long... 6 hours? When Armand and a few 4-5 other method players joined in. They had such respect, so everything they said the rest of the alliance followed. Needles to say the soon turned the bg around and we won!
---
I think lots of people got their Ice Barbed Spear that day! 😁
---
/Ariswe, priest &lt;Regrown&gt;
---
Censorship works pretty well actually. "Try not being offended by racism" tends to be the worst idea in the world.
---
Thank god, you mean?
---
i think if blizz sees a massive uptake of subs in the 48hrs before launch they will spin up more servers
---
&gt; Bestial Wrath
---
This is one of the best talents in the game for world pvp. Specially while levelling, where pets tend to be very powerful.
---
I remember being stuck with chain fear and pet just soloing Warlocks in Vanilla with Bestial Wrath.
---
What is in the top left of the upper monitor broski?
---
&gt; isn't that 2 minute cooldown crazy long
---
No I don't think so. 5 min is crazy long ihmo, 2 is fine. Your pet does a lot of dmg anyway so you usually keep it ready for particular situations, like for pvp.
---
No because then loads of people would reserve names that probably won't be playing in classic so that'll fuck up their predictions of server pop
---
Yeah this...it only gets worse
---
Yeah he was streaming his guide updates during the beta.
---
He's playing it twice
---
I thought this was a diablo forum?
---
They should just allow player kills to award good exp and drop random trash vendor loot and world drops and let the problem sort itself out.
---
He's saying people paying to get a name reserved while not playing retail are more likely to be hardcore.
---
Horrible levelling experience? Slow doesn't mean horrible. Slow, unrewarding and overall boring resemble horrible to me, and that's how BfA levelling is, but I understand blizz has to sell those levelling boosts.
---
Tell bliz that not me, they are the ones who already stated Herod has way too much pop and already the population 10k+ queues.
---
I wasn't saying, omg NOOOO. I was saying like if bliz wants to fix this, which is much their fault and they are attempting to fix, here are some ideas and i asked other to share their own ideas.
---
make a gigantic weak aura so when the swap happens you can't do shit :P
---
Tailoring/Engi
---
People seem so anti-layering. 😶
---
I've always mained melee, first ever lvl 60 was a ret paladin which, if it had a flavour, would be the denture gum my grandma uses.
---
This time I'm going mage. Completely different playstyle and a new tool kit to have a play around with.
---
Also I'm looking forward to having to save my money for my first mount this time, back in Vanilla I would buy stupid shit from the AH allll the time.
---
Selling portals, 1g
---
I don’t even know why BFA even has classes at this point.
---
Besides the fact you've linked to a site that's providing exploits, bots and pirated stuff, it's barely a guide. You might as well just look at the list of WoW zones and their suggested level.
---
Or just make more layers. It's pretty easy to do.
---
Amusingly enough, this makes it look like assassination is the best single spec for people who want to do both pvp and pve.  
---
In reality, I bet even combat with improved sprint is better than a pure assassination spec.
---
This is my background now lol
---
This is all a overhyped problem. I bet like 75% of players won't make it past Level30. There are lots of super casual tourists and retailscrubs there. People here are mostly Hardcore Vanilla Fans but we are like 5% of the whole playerbase, if even that.
---
"repairing the timeline that was damaged by the plague of the scourge"
---
Is this a slight jab at ablizz/acti by any chance?
---
thank you.
---
Looks too alien to me.
---
I used minion and it worked well. The biggest problem is always addons being available through the managers
---
A lot of lazy answers here. I'll try my best.  
---
1. Sense of community. You need to actually group up/ guild up with other people to do things.
---
2. Sense of accomplishment. There are no achievement points and those fancy systems, but when you get that Thunderfury you can feel you achieved something.
---
3. Gear matters. If you see someone geared to the teeth - you instantly know he's good at the game (unless his younger brother at the wheel. but don't tell Blizzard).
---
4. World feels immersive. Even though it doesn't have nearly as much content as retail has, it still provides that sense of insignificance that every adventurer craves for.
---
Retail abandoned these 4 core tenants of MMORPG. That's why it's so boring to me.
---
Yeah maybe the 12 year olds. Most people have some patience.
---
Dick move.
---
This is amazing. Thank you.
---
The trick to preparing for classic is to order several sets of socks from amazon so you can have multiple poop socks for one when gets full.
---
Couldn’t have nailed it more honestly.
---
Terrible “solution”.
---
Weak Auras can probably do this
---
Who says now isn't the most depressing era of my life, Onion? WHO SAYS?
---
Well, that's a shame.
---
Overkill, fine if your into it I guess, I unplugged my 2nd monitor since it's not needed and breaks immersion for me
---
Phasing will never be turned on so I don't think they'll have a problem turning it off.
---
The only Mech I know is SC Terran Mech.
---
Absolutely correct.
---
There is no world PvP in the queue.
---
You think they have to, but they don't
---
It is rough, I know. You an always roll on a Rp server and set goals that correspond your play time.
---
How is no mans sky number 2? Wasn’t that game terrible?
---
I think you have this wrong. I think it said 10k queues AT release (with layering). No that is what it said. They said they aren't going to allow more layers to shorten the queue because then at p2 there would be far too many people
---
Yeah because this was an obvious mistake. Layering is getting removed. This will stay as a smear on Classic forever
---
Wotlk.
---
There were a huge amount of Warriors in Vanilla, too. Trouble was many of them didn't want to tank.
---
Channeling strong Zoidberg
---
Every class has a heal.  Every class has a CC.  Every class has a mobility ability.  Every class has a CC break.  Every class has a stun.  Every class has about a 3 button rotation.
---
The stars are there to say "this class/spec combination is really good at this thing". Combat is only middle of the pack for leveling imo. Maybe even bottom half.
---
I still need a good 1-60 Alliance Guide since he won't update his one. ._.
---
You're just scared of APES you little girl.
---
I don't always log into Reddit to comment, but when I do, there is 10 days until the global launch of World of Warcraft Classic, and an awesome video is in need of upvotes.

I upvotes only because how clean your setup looks. I love it
---
Quit during MoP. Numbers were getting ridiculous (dmg, hp, etc), class identity was dead or dying, cross realm and lfg/lfr had already killed any sense of community... Only interested in Vanilla thru Wrath at this point, to be honest.
---
Because name reservation date passed with only 2 EU English PvP realms.  
---
If they had released 4 instead, people would have been much more spread out on the 4 servers. So they wouldn't have to make posts urging people to move servers.  
---
A lot of people knew 2 EU PvP Servers was a RIDICULOUS lowball for how many servers they would need.
---
Damn. Missed a trick there!!
---
That happens with every new Blizzard game. Blizzard has over 30 milions monthly players with ability to hype every new game release and bring a lot of attention from other games (especialy on Twitch). /r/wow got way more new followers between BFA announcement and launch than /r/classicwow.
---
Issue is people who care also went to Herod.
---
Cool cool. Syne/Vention and I are on Shazzrah.
---
Can't tell if this is an advertisement for Corsair or for Joana's leveling guides.
---
He's talking about PvP servers, which are what many see as the "real" classic servers.
---
So did bobby kotick pay for this or....?
---
Combat leveling damage is pretty good but they have to eat after almost every mob.
---
I would say Blizzcon, I enjoyed the levelling of BFA as I did with legion and the pre raiding point was fun with world Pvp and mythic dungeons but at some point, I realised that BFA had like half the amount of content of legion. The faction campaign was like half the amount of content suramar served (including both factions) and then no class quests also the azurite system being way less fun and flavorful than the artifact one. I think mechagon and Crucible of Storms coming out in fall 2018 would have helped a ton.
---
Overall I think Blizz put a lot into legion because wod flopped then had less time for the next expac and just made a repainted legion with less content, like the battle of dazar'alor and Nazjatar seem like quick content to make.
---
Yeah, they said it already has 10k too many people.
---
Came out in 2004, I was 19. A teenager.
---
Was it a long journey up the stairs?
---
It sure is. Not only its harder due more complex it also has no end. 
---
If you play classic 20h every day, some day you'll finish your gear.
---
If you do the same on retail you'll never finish it. I did around 100 Lv10-15 Mythic runs this season, so around 300 items &amp; I saw 1 item at 455 w/ socket (best possible item).
---
Wow
---
Outside of the controversy of merging realms and/or offering free transfers, I think the biggest reason for why they're going this route is because it's a cost savings.  Why spend the money on servers that probably will end up not being used when you can use layering to better utilize fewer servers until the population dies down?
---
I know STV has a reputation but don't sleep on Hillsbrad Foothills. Taren Mill and Southshore are literally right next to each other and it's going to be a blood bath.
---
Also put a star for combat world pvp. At least before 60 with an asterisk. Adrenaline rush and blade flurry will tear anyone up that doesn’t have adequate armor/stamina for pvp yet. You can kill bear druids. Easily.
---
Yup, master loot is for guilds and pre-made groups with a specific goal, or ninja looters.  If they're up front when looking for members about "x drop is for y player" then that's fine, but if they just don't mention it, that's a big red flag.
---
well its hype cause most mmo's have shyed away from many factors that built the genre even before wow. Clasic and BFA are basicly completely different games with some shared backgrounds.
---
If you prefer games with consistant more casual progression and belance out every player BFA will be more your speed. If you like games with that challenge you to overcome or be persistant to reach your personal goals even if it means sometimes being at a clear disadvantage Classic will interest you. If you never played an older or more "hardcore"(not that many will conside classic hardcore as a whole) than I'd recomend trying classic first before you get comfy with luxurious of BFA that many classic players detest.
---
tips play what you want don't give in to elitist rabble unless you want to specifically progress with those people. plenty of awesome beginner new to wo guides on youtube I'd recommend "Madseason" for entry level content and someone more like "tipsout" if you endup wanting to get into the weeds(he hosts some great deep dives)
---
bad things include spending more time playing than you reasonably should and getting overly passionate about a 15 year old game.
---
Yes, and the light was too bright
---
Good news! Questie’s newest update offers a toggle feature for quest objectives, so you can toggle off quest objectives and only see available/completed quests on your map/mini-map
---
Oh perfect , ty
---
Yeah Priest is fine, it’s Druid, Shaman and Paladin which have vastly different stat priority’s when switching specs.
---
In general I won't join any Loot Council Guilds. That never works! Even if you want to be fair, people rather give someone to a friend if they can. 
---
I want a Guild with a Fixed/Attendence DKP and Loot Council for major Items like Legendaries etc.
---
I'm torn between orc and troll hunter talking about both PVP and PVE perspectives.
---
Orcs have 5% more pet dmg (great for wpvp and pve in general) and reduced stun duration (pretty big in vanilla)
---
When trolls have 5% more dmg to beasts (pretty random does help against some mobs/bosses while  being completely useless for other) and improved bow skill (which means less% hit chance needed so you can optimize your gear a bit better)
---
I find their active racials pretty much equal so I dont care there.
---
Servers will be dead due to layering, also servers will be so overpopulated you won't be able to quest.
---
Exactly. WoW subs were at their strongest during Vanilla, it peaked at WotLK, but with their monthly sub reveals there was a hit during TBC. Before BC was released, WoW was sitting on 9.2 million subscribers. From BC through WotLK it peaked at 12. It started it's steady and rather sharp decline with Cata. Why people think Classic is going to suck, I can't understand. Subs have been dwindling since Cata, we all know that, but the numbers for the Vanilla era are enormous. That's when the playerbase surged and held strong, arguably growing, and would have continued, I think, even without TBC. I'm not trying to fanboi here, as I was accused. I'm looking at numbers. I don't expect a return to 9.2m subs for Classic, I'm merely pointing out the base Vanilla built that TBC and WotLK profited from, and that Cata killed. Classic is going to be popular. It will be a smash hit. My kids, who were too young to play back then, but play retail, are estatic for Classic, ya know, those teens that are too stupid to like depth? Yeah. They've played private servers and are glad to have Classic here run by Blizzard. Stereotyping because you think the state of Profit First Triple-A publishers are how Gamers want things is a mistake. A finely crafted and cared for product will ALWAYS outlast the quick buck mentally, and few publishers get it, because they're run by profit hungry accountants.

I don't get the name reserve thing, unless you're a streamer or whatever. Cool you got the name 'God' or 'Legolas'. It's not a good name. Oh you got your own name that no one was gonna take anyway? Nice.

Honestly my post is already summing things up quite a lot, don't quite see how I can trim it more without missing crucial info. Never was good at this.

Phases of what? They mentioned DUNGEONING and RAIDS in the post.
---

Filthy casual!
---
The Battleground has an equal ammount of people on each side right? So it's already a solution to the imbalanced world pvp. 
---
I suggest they suck it up or reroll server..
---
How about Server imbalance? It can be more difficult or easyer to gear up in my server than yours. 
---
It also ruins the feeling of community on the server. I don't want to play with other people from others servers, I dont care they exist. I want everybody I meet to be relevant to the world I play in.

I was one of the lucky few to get ahold of this. We had three left half's drop over the first year and I got the last one basically for free as no one wanted it. After that I banked dkp and grabbed the right one about 2 months later. Such an epic quest line. I'll never forget all my guild, my PvP mates and even random Horde come help take down Thunderaan. The journey to get it and the swag that came with it was unreal.
---
I think you are the ones with clouded eyes because you just use love as a justification for facts...

Obviously there will be queues, obviously there will be rage, for less than a week.
---
Numbers will be great on Classic i have no doubt, but don't go with the is going to blow up, it won't.
---
This is a pretty silly assumption. A lot of people want their powerful rigs to look clean as well. OP is running a 9900K and a RTX 2070, so it couldn't get much better.
---
Holy shit you're balling dude.
---
The best leveling spec changes over time. Fire is actually better than Frost at the start for example, and something like a Priest can grab Wand Specialization first and then respec into Shadowform at 40. You can argue that the cost isn't worth it of course, but if you're purely concerned about speed then it is definitely worth respeccing once or twice during levelling for most classes.
---
I've rewatched this several times, it still gets me each time.
---
Thunk.
---
15 years of stuff to redo over and over and over again, good argument.
---
Did I try to make an argument of classic vs retail or is that you just putting words in my mouth I was simply saying people are bored in retail with very little things to keep them entertained and making names on classic servers.
---
Very sorry that happened to you, but I prelogged and it worked fine.
---
Never purchased it, just played on private servers.
---
they absolutely do. it will be exploited to hell and back if layering isn't stopped before then
---
There's lots to enjoy but keeping focus is hard when Classic is knocking at the back of your mind.
---
You're planning on having a cum sock? I don't think I'd be able to cope with 40 min of one handed play. I'm going nofap for the first week.

At least in Cata keybinds carried over from one PC to another, I borrowed my account to a friend when I was done with the game and had 4 months of subscription left, returned during MoP with his keybinds.
---
And in the post he mentions DUNGEONS and RAIDS. Which dungeons are you doing when you're prepped for phase 3?
---
get lucky in counter-strike?  how?  that game was pure skill, thats why i loved it and other millions too.
---
I can almost believe that, even in the stress tests going from Elwynn to Westfall, it goes from packed to empty, maybe everyone justs get stuck farming candles and gold dust.
---
Thats pretty much precisely what i did
---
even against real players? I know that I need it against mobs but what about players who are my level or 1-2 levels higher?
---
Yeah I went and checked my guild's first MC kill, the quality is shitty, the damage meter was shitty, but it was all yellow and blue at the top.
---
We need more servers available during name reservation. Blizz by intention or not layed the foundation for what is (the Herod situation). And further by refusing to open more realms pre-emptively is going to compund this issue come launch.
---
Oh yeah! This spaceship interface
---
Really nice. Not a cable in sight, well done. 
---
Bring on Classic!!!
---
Sure. Let everyone post their favorite art from their SO to commemorate the event that is classic. We can call it r/notclassicwow
---
Rubbish... plenty of time to quests.. it just adds an extra element.. don’t go STV and you’re fine... make it sound like there is someone ready to  gank you at every, which is far from the truth. Bis gear is in dungeons for the most part... don’t have to fight anyone there. Conflicts doesn’t necessarily start just because two from the opposite faction meets...
---
ugh youre one of those td players
---
I’m not changing classic db for wowhead, wowhead wasn’t around for years only till blizzard announced classic and they decided to jump on the bandwagon
---
This piece was done by Genevieve at Equinox Tattoo in Montreal. She was (and is) super awesome! Definitely check out her other stuff on Insta - genevieveft.tattoo - if you like the style :)
---
Yes the same dungeons as earlier phases? But do people play frost mage in Naxx too etc?
---
thanks I will change it then. I thought it would be a waste in PvP, I was wrong. 
---
by the way, why is permafrost inferior? it makes chill last a lot longer and isn't chill on all my frost spells?
---
Blizzard missed a trick by not getting Warcraft III: Reforged ready and released a couple of weeks before classic launch. Plenty of Classic WoW fans would have purchased it and done a playthrough on the lead up to classic. When it releases this year now, I'm going to be too busy playing classic to have a chance to play it.
---
What's the 27th month called?
---
That's a nice way to lie while technically telling the truth. The reason why a medium sized Classic server has more players than vanilla is because of layering but there's a ton of players who will quit Classic in a few months, which is exactly why Blizzard has plans of permanently removing layering in phase 2.  When that happens there might not be enough players around for the server to feel as full as a high population vanilla server.
---
You need a weekly event for your shitposts. It's not your fault, the model team is just half shortbus
---
Omg, I’m crying already ;( !! I am going home AGAIN. &lt;3
---
Some people enjoy it?
---
I think Lootappraiser does something like that in some way. You get an AH sound when something drops and gives you the value of the loot on your server(this depends on which database you use, i think). https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lootappraiser
---
Holy shit, I got goosebumps - I'm so happy Classic is bringing back Machinimas and they're so well made!
---
nooooo i don't want to go back to the warcraft 1 days

Frost is fine for dungeons, which is part of what I was responding to, and I specified that it's fine for MC as well. Get off your goddamned high horse.
---
Crossrealm battlegrounds and phasing makes them less affecting anyway.....
---
I played on a private server with a name that started with ely. That server held about 8 to 10 players.  The que was around 10 to 15k. That took several hours.
---
Id still like to see Mr Allen saying "we were wrong"
---
4 hour queues on a 3k pop realm are ridiculous
---
4 hour queues on a 100k pop realm are a great deal
---
how about skipping piercing ice for permafrost?
---
Tbf there are still 3 of them. 4 if you count the rp-pvp one
---
&gt; he nightborne and high mountain Tauren are the only two that are exceptionally time consuming since they are old world stuff
---
don't forget lightforged and Void Elves- they're even worse, because they aren't even just "old world stuff", they're gated by late-patch-addition factions that you'll only *start* grinding rep for when you've basically already left Legion content behind (unless they changed it so you can level Legion content on Argus?).

Because they're neat

Name creation was just so people can grab their unoriginal names. The ones that go early. And it is the minority. I have unique names that will be open at launch and have no intention of subbing until a day before, as with the majority in my opinion. 8/10 people didn't name save in my group.

Was there no room to the right? Or move the pc to another position and place the monitor there?

Really neat look all around though :)

Yeap, and mixed with RNG so you'll feel like shit for not logging in regularly.

world pvp is going to be dead with p3 either way regardless of the population size

Anyone remember roughly how many hours it might take to do 1-300 mining with a normal level 40 mount? assuming you're level 60 already
---
This hits home!!
---
Man you need to play some RPGs if you think wow is more of an RPG than an MMO.
---
They literally just added another server. Chill, they have it under control. This is not retail team.
---
Only played 6months of retail so first time playing classic ever :)
---
R/wow
---
Are you sure you're going to enjoy Classic, doesn't seem you played it. At least at lvl60.
---
you redo every game, every movie you see more than once, that isn't what makes bfa dislikable, it's the lost community, the lost mass pvp areas, the unbalanced but balanced pvp, the enjoyment on doing things slower but that rewarded you so much, Classic is the most grindy game, you redo everything to the max, but the reward is amazing, so yes, your argument is shit, because Classic IS about GRINDING and RE-DOING stuff.
---
OP is surely leveling holy pally, second monitor for porn ofc

Just because you don't see used dishes and jizz rags everywhere doesnt mean they don't use it. Some people like a clean workspace.

No lie there are people who think Golemagg will be dead because Blizz didn't make a seperate post about it.

---
It's a Mac, so probably no.
---
What the hell why is that nelf looking like that? Haven’t played WoW in years and this looks shit
---
Private servers had 10k at all times. It works out okay in the long run because everyone is spread out and not packed into the low level zones.
---
But diapers need replacement! "Brb bio" is even faster

Shaman and shaman

As far as I’m aware, he tries to stay away from the Internet in general. According to him, he has an “addictive personality” so he doesn’t want to risk it.
---
Many people say that we only miss nostalgia but they are missing the point that with the changes core mechanics also have changed, there's nothing wrong with chill slow lvling and coming back to the old instances and raids, in main wow you can't have the full experience because the old instance and raid balance is broken, I think the core mistake was increasing level cap and making better gear which made old stuff obsolete, in Guild Wars they nailed it, you don't chase gear there but the fun aspects of acomplishment and more visual items and not OP ones.
---
What they could have done, a suggestion which has been brought up here on the forum long ago, is to create "layered selection" when it comes to servers. So choosing a server your choices are Shazzrah 1, Shazzrah 2, Shazzrah 3, Golemag 1 etc.
---
 So Shazzrah 1-3 would share a naming pool for characters and guilds. If the player count gets low on one of them you can merge it with another without forcing people to lose names. If the population stays high you can change the name. So Shazzrah 3 would eventually, if not low population, become "Hogger" or whatever. The namechange could even be made into a fun event on the official forum. Give people with a character above level x on the server a chance to vote for a new name using a list Blizzard posts.
---
Just stop. You've already established to everyone that you're a mental midget. Let's not go any further.

---
I'm with you. I'm against layering past the first week. But you see they dont care, simply by the amount of people on each server
---
All the realms are going to be full on launch day. I dont quite fathom how stupid one has to be to not get this.

Don't listen to the douchebags. It's a fine piece of art and you clearly enjoy it. That's all that matters.

Me: &lt;kills level 35 alliance player&gt;

Alliance player logging off and getting his main: "I'm about to do what's called a pro gamer move"

lol what's the point of an ultrawide if you're going to use it like two monitors
---
Hurricanes nax video still gives me chills such a bad ass at building raid hype Blizz should Defo hire him
---
And preferably a 2nd or 3rd story window nearby so you can fling the full socks out the window and never have to worry about them again
---
Exactly. Also, established guilds that now have their community entrenched on the original 2 servers aren't going to uproot and move the whole guild to a new one. That will piss off people that reserved their names and is a whole lot of effort to do. If there was a more reasonable amount of pvp servers at the name reservation (e.g 5 or so), those guilds would be a lot more spread out across 5 realms. Instead we have most of the guilds on the 2 base servers, and very few on the new one.
---
Just add them as we need them or if you create too many population will be spread too thin and like I said before once the retail tourist leave they'll be forced to merge which nobody likes
---
Most tattoos are retarded to begin with
---
Real vanilla players are virgin. Cum reserves are sweaten
---
This is a great idea indeed!

Are the quests mentioned also available for alliance?
---
Really? That’s pretty low dude, it’s a badass tattoo if you liked wow or not. And it is apart of WoW so piss off
---
All the realms are going to be full on lauch day. I can say with utnost certainty that wow classic community is one of the dumbest, stupidest community I've ever seen.
---
All realms are high population and will have layering.
---
most of the guys I know &lt;40 even the ones subbed to BFA havnt reserved a name yet.

You defile your body with this utter filth heathen . But do not worry for I can cleanse you and cast a lasting judgment that can bring you back to the light.
---
The only way to successfully use that is to have a scorpid pet, get the pet to stack poison on the target then use sting. This way you'll make the target use more mana to cleanse than the actual sting would drain. But let's be hones - no one would use a scorpid pet, because it will break traps/scatters.
---
I just told you why.
---
Yeah, I’m having trouble with that, too, as well as “more moving parts” and dungeons being more challenging.
---
I don’t agree with any of those three points.  Not being salty, and absolutely willing to defend my position if necessary.  Just saying, those three points strike me as off target.
---
I never liked wowhead, it was a website full of bloatware.  I'd rather use a no nonsense basic database anyway.
---
I always expanded it with lockpicks for no apparent reason. Just to make it bigger... I wonder if other people messed with the keyring as well...
---
And the layers will be full enough for a good time.

Layering *isn’t an issue at all*

ClassicDB wasn't a thing during Vanilla. At least WoWhead bought Thottbot and has a theme to make the modern site look like it did in Vanilla.

No official confirmation yet, but it will probably turn red (clickable) or you may have to reload the client (close and click “Play”) when Server’s are live.

skull of impending doom. casuals
---
That's not at all how layering works....  
---
Think of layering like a dungeon.  
---
Multiple groups can run the same dungeon at the same time because of instancing, layers are instances in the open world that overlap.  
---
Layering is being used because at launch **EVERYONE** will be in one of 6 starter zones and there will be simply too many people competing for quest items and mobs. Once everyone has spread out across the world the layers will be removed and we'll all be in the same instance because we won't all be crowded into a small area.  
---
It will have no effect at all on actual server population numbers.

Young people are allowed to like Classic. Dw.

Please no, bad idea, I want to be able to buy feet of the lynx for 2g...

---
How much poon do you get when your sees that thing?🙂
---
/world is a global channel controlled by GMs on pservers. It isn't in Classic.
---
Servers will go down before launch, so no.
---
Yeah those normal servers are pretty damn imbalanced. Like 75/25 imbalanced. Besides Blizz already said that there will be cross realm battlegrounds
---
Oh yeah, I can imagine Eminem playing games heavy.
---
We have to remember he grew up like most of us, albeit different struggles. Gaming was still huge for his generation in Detroit
---
Just for interest, the data in classicDB relays on which data? Original Blizz or the proven inaccurate private servers?
---
Would like to stay on classicDB but I also want to have accurate numbers!
---
Blizzard should hire this man! 
---
He knows how to touch our emotions :)
---
You’re in for a fantastic experience my friend, never mind how old you were just be glad you get to experience this monumental game with the rest of us
---
Are they though?  
---
If they'd want to make M+ an esports, they first would need to fix the horrendous and absolute garbage balancing of the classes, which resulted in seeing the same comps over and over.  
---
That's not really fun to watch, some of the earlier M+ tournaments when teams played a lot of different shit was way more entertaining to watch, since different comps allowed for different strategies.  
---
Just look at this shitty leaderboard:  
---
https://www.wowprogress.com/mythic_plus/
---
Always Monk/Warrior Tank. Always Rdruid healer, always at least 1 Rogue even up to 3 Rogues.   
---
Since they don't balance around that at all, it's hard to agree with your point.
---
I miss X-Fire so much, SO much.
---
Honestly I'd rather they just put up a (real-time) info-graphic on the blizzard site
---
Server Queues @ (date:time)
---
+ Server_A: bar/line that represents queue-size
---
+ Server_B: bar/line that represents queue-size
---
+ ...
---
+ Server_n: bar/line that represents queue-size
---
Once people can (visually) see that Server_XYZ has a queue size orders of magnitude longer than another server (which, might have zero queue) they'll swap immediately.
---
Yes. You can solo-farm princess in Mara or do tribute runs. Nets you a lot of gold per hour.
---
You can't replace the BG queue with spamming trade chat because you rely on the other faction also participating and you can't communicate with them.
---
For LFG you can communicate with your faction so there's no need for that.
---
&gt; As for the meaning of full they explained it a bit on the link I posted in the op.
---
The only thing I see regarding this is "Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity." And this really does not tell us anything meaningful. If you are referring to something else, could you please provide me with the link? I am curious as to what it actually means.
---
* What population are they aiming for mid to long-term?
---
* How many layers will there be on a server?
---
* What population will be on each layer?
---
Oh, I missed Gehennas being added.
---
As I said: You aren't wrong with what you say and to some extend, Blizzards behavior is understandable. But in my opinion they are being way too cautious. Just taking Germany as an example, we have two servers (1 PvE and 1 PvP) and both are full. Let's assume that the target realm population is 10k players, that means the expectation is 20k players from Germany. This is a utterly ridiculous expectation imo.
---
In any case. Either give us more servers or be more transparent. Nobody can even try to be sympathetic to Blizzard if we have no clue about their reasoning.
---
nope its refering to the scourge invasion and naxx
---
Where have you read that? I havent been able to find any Information about it.
---
Oh no. Clean and well curated!
---
I bought an RTX 2080 Super and squeezed an extra 100mhz out of my 8700k just in case though.
---
Please no
---
Both races are good for Hunter.  
---
Orc: Better PVP, Good PVE  
---
Troll: Good PVP, Better PVE  
---
For pre-raid BIS both races will most likely go for a crossbow therefor trolls will not be utilizing the bow specialisation. Untill you can upgrade the Crossbow with a Bow, the "**Rhok'delar**" longbow is very strong becomes bow specialisation very strong.
---
This was posted and got over 200 upvotes... yesterday
---
bruh she looks like Daenarys
---
Why cant I see feral top meters or do the DPS this thread is saying they can in any pserver logs or videos of raids then?
---
Is nobody gonna comment on the GOTG playlist?
---
You are a man of culture OP. Especially 'I'm not in love' is a masterpiece imo.
---
I'm staying put! Heroddddddd!
---
Yeah that is nice, I agree. I just think its not worth the sacrifise
---
What makes it badass? And "apart of WoW" is bad argument, if that the case what stops people from just posting retail shit here? Retail is part of wow too.
---
Mixed nationalities in the upper picture vs 1 ethnicity in the lower
---
also I don't understand anything of this discussion - there's just 2 PvP realms in the US, you're going to get a mix of everything on both servers.
---
I was 19 when vanilla released and really looking forward for take 2 :)
---
Is it really that hard to figure out?
---
If you make it free you are going to have bots creating free accounts and reserving every fucking name instantly, not to mention it's really hard to gague how many people are actually going to be playing if you have to try and figure out whos a bot and whole a real person making a character on that realm.
---
Having fun is not about solving all puzzles the game offers you in advance by reading a guide. At least not for me. I have fun figuring things out. And according to this thread, it seems like some people demand just that: not knowing the answer to a problem in advance and figuring it out their own.
---
You misread the spec requirements buddy, core2duo is more than enough.
---
For the real vanilla experience u gotta play it on a microwave. If u don’t raid on 10fps , ure doing it wrong.
---
thanks for this nice and very informative video mate. Could you please make a more extensive video on Leatrix Plus?
---
Okay. Yea, logging on a few, if not many hours before release is the plan I'll use. You should as well :) If they dont shut down the servers before. I guess we just have to wait and see.
---
Exactly, we must fight against these art/tattoo posters before its too late, or else we'll turn into r/wow
---
Anti-Herod propaganda.  Stay strong, my brothers.
---
I mean there's always masturbation
---
workspace lol. Imagine thinking anyone playing WoW has a job, how deluded
---
They don't have margins for that on the servers. We already have 10000 player queues. The servers are overcrowded. Medium means more people than the most crowded realm from vanilla. Most of the servers are at Full. What they have is a number of servers that can be activated on very short notice. I don't think this strategy to activate additional realms one by one is that bad. They just screwed up by having the initial number so **absurdly** low. Blizzard going above the vanilla 3000 cap makes perfect sense since a good number of retail players will just be tourists but now you have realms that should have 6000 but have 20000+ players. 
---
I think it would have been optimal if they had said in advance :  If you level to 5(or10) on the stress servers you can also reserve names on the official realms. Tada a good amount of the actual Classic fans that will probably stay on the server already have chars which is a much better representation of the real numbers. This would have given an actual incentive to play the stress test with a reward at the end.
---
if you are ready to get rekt by random normal mobs (for pve servers)
---
if you are ready to get rekt by random normal mobs while being rekt by opposite faction (for pvp servers) 
---
if you are ready to spend hrs getting your pots for a raid or dungeon just to get your wipes rolling over and over  
---
if you are ready to do proffesions grind just to have your gold &gt;0  
---
then you are good to go
---
most of the people dont tho, but they will figure out that later
---
bunch of sweaty neckbeards who control the entire servers economy.. and also spend all day ganking  
---
im sure if you look them up on google youll find people complaining about them
---
I'm not married lol. I'm a free man and living my best life. its 2019, you can get laid whenever you want off tinder bro. You dont need to get married
---
40-60 ppl terrorize the whole eu community. It’s epic
---
Boars are good pets, especially if you dont want to control your pet and leave it on defensive. They however fall behind vs a managed Cat/Owl in prolonged fights because of their DPS output. Most hunters will be leveling with a Cat.
---
I'm also torn between Orc and Troll
---
Wheel.  Of.  Misfortune!
---
IMO if you want to do both PvP and PvE, orc is the way to go. 
---
Trolls technically win out for the top hunter damage for horde in PvE, but unless you're going to be raiding and only raiding (and I think it only mattered post-BWL) I would say that's not the thing to consider. 
---
What really tips the scales is the orc passive stun resist if you're PvPing. Hardiness- It isn't reduced stun duration, it's increased stun resistance, meaning the stun never even happens on you roughly 1/3 time. It has that huge of an affect of your overall survival against rogues, warriors, engineering stuns (which all serious PvP players will be using), paladin HoJ, druid bear/cat form stuns, other hunters pets intimidations, etc. 
---
Those stuns are usually relied upon to win fights or keep you in melee range, and resisting them can allow you get away, reset, and control the fight again. 
---
Also, it isn't that big of an issue gearing with shamans- they'll generally want more caster stats and you'll want more agility and AP.
---
1-30 has a ton of quests. 30-45 is a barren wasteland. 45-60 has a ton of quests.
---
leeets goOooOoOo
---
What is that monitor stand?
---
You do you, it wasn't a condemnation just my perception.
---
The timeframe for every class except Hunter and maybe Druid is not going to be similar at all to those times.
---
Every private server had dungeon XP wrong. With corrected values everyone at the front of the pack is going to be dungeon grinding and it will be significantly faster than their class can quest. Enough that they will potentially be keeping up or even beating the solo questing hunters.
---
Personally I won't be able to play until the 30th due to work, but I plan on going hardcore 12 year old and order a large pizza, keep a huge bowl of Doritos and a 4 pack of monsters nearby. Will probably die the next day, but hey, at least I got to play classic. Worth.
---
The thing is, if they pick a server people get pissed because they got a server, if they don't, people will get pissed because there are foreigners on "their" server.  
---
We've been asking for a latam dedicated server for years now, and still 150+Ms is the least of our worries because we have to deal with xenophobic aholes
---
Yeah this was actually posted originally 3 months ago with 300 upvotes, but people seem to post most of my videos over and over during the hypetrain for Vanilla, so I'm shamelessly cashing in by growing my youtube channel, why should everyone else get all the glory for my work?
---
My two characters names are so obscure i could sub 2 years into classic and still get them.
---
I'm not saying base level dungeons are more challenging, but high level mythic+ and mythic raids are harder than anything in classic pve, just mechanically and in skill required. BFA isn't harder overall, it just has some options that are harder.
---
Save some pussy for the rest of us
---
Will for sure be using this. I plan on making 2 night elves. Both will be questing in eastern kingdoms.
---
Yup. Also as others have pointed out - you start gathering pre raid bis items so running the 52+ instances multiple times ain't that bad.
---
&gt; Sorry, you're rate limited. Please wait a few moments then try again.
---
Yeah, fuck you too Twitter. DAE think the site went to shit after the redesign?
---
How can a single guild control the entire servers economy? That sounds mental, Surely a single guild cannot impact the entire server in such a severe way?
---
Cleeeannn
---
nah im 13
---
I have no solid Blue posts regarding layering. I remembered reading something along the lines of one layer = one vanilla wow server blade population. But I didn't find solid evidence of that. 
---
What population are they aiming for mid to long term ? I'm not even sure they have a clue. I think their current narrative is to follow the flow daily and see where it will go. And then properly adjust. At least that's the vibe I get from the extra servers coming up to meet demand on relatively short notice. 
---
My bad though I understood your question as "How many players is "Full" ?". I have no extra info on that.
---
I first got started on an rp realm because my friends were already there. I never really got into world pvp but also don’t understand how it works anymore. How do pvp realms actually work? Where is safe? What isn’t? Do you think it would be worth trying on a pvp realm this time?
---
If you have selfish leaders/officers that’s you’re guild’s problem, not the loot system.
---
Nice carpet
---
It's because people are mentally weak failures who are severely intimidated by fucking nothing. None of this matters. Jesus christ, this community is pure cancer...
---
Laptop Bros Unite!
---
At least this game will run smoothly with pretty much any rig.
---
So fricking excited.
---
We don't even know when phase one ends. People like you seem to always conveniently forget that
---
That's where you need a coalition of guilds to get together and put the stompdown on them
---
&gt;thanks for cementing in my head why i play on PvE servers.
---
Yup. Save yourself the grief.
---
I'm 51, chump.
---
And you know nothing about me.
---
[I wrote this.](http://sins.sourceforge.net/)
---
So many idiots
---
You too could possess a breakfast table
---
Same pattern here, sometimes I also try to get my main name on another server just in case...
---
And bloodbath is what everyone wants.
---
Cooking/eating food takes a lot of time you won't be leveling. I would heavily recommend training/capping First Aid, to heal both yourself and your pet when needed.
---
I hope there's nerds on my server that need taught a lesson.
---
Should have used wow sounds instead of guns.  Rogue stealth, night elf male death, gorillas etc etc.
---
That's why you make friends and join a guild. Add people that you quest with and see in the cities. This is why people like vanilla better, because it encourages you to be social and make friends within the community and join a guild instead of just pushing a button and playing with randoms
---
APES actually lost to pretty much everyone in beta in a fair fight, they just owned the private server community where the competition wasn't very good. They will be completely inconsequential in official classic.
---
Some people might, I'm not spending 2 month's salary to buy a phone, just like I won't be paying for something I'm not using. 
---
I'll wait till release.
---
I get the max graphics on my laptop but i miss the comfort of a desk 😂
---
Played private TBC server years ago and got trolled hard there by rogues on my human warlock.
---
It's an allied race, which is a whole new race on it's own in the character creation menu but they are not that different to be classified as whole new characters.
---
So basically Alliance players wanted High elves so Blizzard was like, we will make High elves for u but not really but also yes.
---
And then there was a ton of people on the forums rioting about it. Demanding being able to be a Paladin Void elf and have blue eyes and normal skin with it. Then one of the devs said "Go play Horde XD" then people got more pissed and accused Blizzard of Horde bias.
---
TLDR: People irrationally angry at a selfish desire like usual.
---
And there are other raids in the LATER PHASES as the title still suggests.
---
For real '04 experience.
---
I was planing to sub -1 day. Now I am thinking maybe -3.
---
nah dude.... all of their members are level 60 in like 2days tops.. seriously.. look into them.. they are VERY hardcore.. not that theres anything wrong with that.. but they are a bunch of nerds LMAO
---
Then imagine how many who already subscribes to bfa will join and play/try classic
---
Is there any estimated information about the horde/alliance ration on EU servers ?
---
Im crying
---
People just want to get on a good server. Even if the risks joining a server with big streamers, a guild with bad reputation etc are small the rationale would be better safe than sorry. Nothing strange about it regardless of how big of a negative impact exists in reality.
---
It's your own fault for being inflexible. We all knew this would happen when everyone joined Herod. You'd barely notice playing with &lt;5% streamers or South Americans and yet you'd rather clusterfuck Herod and not even play than get over yourselves.
---
Will be like Diablo 3. Servers dead the first week. People angry that they can't play. Then we can play for a week. People angry that the game is too hard. 
---
Bad troll
---
What happened?
---
Because it does

Full/High/Medium/Low designation only indicates number of created characters. It doesn't have anything to do with online population threshold which is the same for every server.
---
Just a part of the swedish community really, and not the Nordic community as a whole which is split.
---
Done responding to someone who refuses to understand what my initial response was to.
---
Spec variations have diff weights also
---
Dumping everything on ascension classes is wrong though, since it was Imho a futile attmept to somehow balance 2.0 endgame. Remember how tempest league was? It was awfull. Like 4 builds were able to clear high lvl maps, the balance between offense and defense was ruined, the general consensus shifted from creating balanced builds to grab as much pool as possible and dump everything else into damage. And the first major patch ( wich came out like half a year after release of 2.0) with talisman league brought us renewed poison and curse auras and *more damage* gems.
---
So now all of the sudden you forget blizzard's tourist statement?
---
Ofcourse theres more players on a medium server then the highest pop server had in 2006.
---
Blizzard estimates 70% to leave by the first couple months. 
---
What is worse however that even if 70% of the players on Shazzra/Golem leave after the first couple months. We will still be well above 2006's server cap.
---
What are the names?
---
that's how I want classic wow to be =)
---
I played for 2 days at bfa release then took break until 5-6 months later still playing though very casual
---
me irl
---
Players genuinely wanted a shit launch. Here. I can prove it:
---
[Example 1:](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/agrgw6/i_see_threads_every_day_worrying_that_blizzard_is/eeb5s2b/)
---
&gt; Ive played plenty of anticipated private server launches through the time, all of them were **unplayable for a while, but it was still an experience I value personally.** And that is exactly what leads me to say that I personally dont think they should shard it, at any time.
---
[Example 2:](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c7qm59/layering_makes_the_world_lose_integrity_economy/esib1n7/)
---
&gt; Even a queue is a memorable event.. a controversial one for many players probably, but **much more interesting than a super smooth, non MMORPG like launch** that has no issues caused by massive player influx at all.
---
[Example 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c7qm59/layering_makes_the_world_lose_integrity_economy/eshyhu3/)
---
&gt; What? **Server queues preserve the integrity of the classic experience.** I'm not so impatient that I can't wait a short time to play the game, knowing the wait makes it that much better for everyone. Have some respect for the game and stop being selfish.
---
[Example 4:](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/akmw4d/can_we_stop_with_the_small_changes_please/efb0ush/)
---
&gt; Maybe you prefer instant server access over Authentic community gameplay, but the one that we originally asked for when this all began seems to be the fairer choice here to me.
---

---
The real Vietnam look
---
Considering Vanilla is 15 years old, it's kind of hard to come up with unique insights about the old metagame
---
Problem is the super long queues don't show up until layering goes away.
---
Discord karaoke
---
Layering is off before P2 no matter what.
---
Looks like there's less of them. Blizz have all but said they'll add an extra PvP server per region once the current newest ones fill, but no word on pve now being high pop across the board.
---
The computer close to the wall is what is bugging me

Private servers were/are way bigger than Classic servers will ever be

It was. And it was beautiful.
---
And I'm going back.
---
 Also for anyone that has missed it, you can do a short walk over the mountains in Dun Morogh, jump to your death once you see the zone switch to Wetlands and res near Menethil Harbor.
---
 My plan is to do this when I have finished the quest near Gnomeregan were you kill leper gnomes. Since it's so close to the mountains anyways I will grab the Wetlands flightpath and then hearth back to Kharanos. It's like a couple of minutes of extra time spent.
---
Once they implemented the dungeon finder and LFR, the community aspect of wow was done. Especially during Lich king where you had to sit down and log in (sometimes in queue) to sit down in Dalaran and queue up for a dungeon.
---
You were a person logging into a closed (before server merging) online community of strangers from all over the world, that then was queueing you into an online community of random strangers from an open streamer of people you’d like never see again.
---
The idea of community died within Wrath of the Lich King
---
who needs pussy if you have bg's?????? I need R14
---
No mate I just dont bother I stay out in the open world and level when I get to 60 I go into a city and find a guild. I always roll healer so it's not like I find it hard.
---
That's the issue though the majority of people who can do dungeons at the appropriate level dont because it take to much time out of the game to go get a group together.
---
Why find a group for a lvl 30 dugeon when you can just level up outside and skip it in the time it would have taken you  to get the group together
---
I've legitimately tried to give FFXIV a chance but wow classic has spoiled me. I've been playing on private vanilla servers for years. Most of these shills are mad their servers will be empty when the tourists come from their jrpg mmo to give classic a chance.

Yeah, I just think it's a bit of a dick move to reserve a name if you don't itend to use it.
---
One of my most memorable adventures in vanilla was the journey from Darkshore to Ironforge. I was such a noob that I actually had to follow the signs. The long road from Wetlands was the best part of it, running away from those ?? level spiders on the side of the roads was actually stressing.
---
The tears won't stop flowing
---
Hence my comment old chap.
---
Anyone know if cross realm battlegrounds span realm types? For example, can PvE cross PvP? Also curious since there's only one rp and one rppvp realm in the Americas.
---
No he didn't.

---
&gt; f all existing players on this server remain there, login queues in excess of 10,000 players are a certainty, and possibly much higher than that.
---
... and
---
&gt;While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.
---
They are saying while they could allow unlimited layering thus take as much population as they want.. They are not doing that and instead are going to stick with the current population cap, that will "certainly" result in 10k queues on live.

I tried convincing my gf to play with me but she thinks the pace is too slow. I can't argue with that, but it's one of the reasons I love classic
---
the assumption is based on the premise that need/greed system acts only as an interface for BOE whereas it has an actual function for BOP. This is self evident but let me run you through an example.
---
1. (no need/greed system exists) *BOE item drops and is automatically given to a player* that player can then trade the item to whomever they please.
---
2. (no need/greed system exists) *BOP item drops and is automatically given to a player* this player can not trade the item.
---
3. (need/greed system exists ) *BOE item drops and people who dont want it greed, one person wants it and and rolls need* - same outcome as scenario 1.
---
4. (need/greed system exists) *BOP item drops and people who dont want it greed, one person wants it and rolls need* - group can now control who gets the item.
---
As you can see, the need/greed system only effects the outcome for BOP items.

Against an equal level player you have a 4% chance to miss, you can reduce this to a 1% chance to miss with chance to hit. Each additional level above you adds an additional 1% chance to miss so a +1 mob/player is a 5% chance to miss. You can never have better than a 99% chance to hit as a mage, no matter how much hit you stack that last % can't be obtained.
---
Mobs considered to be bosses have a I believe its a 17% chance to miss. So its very difficult / borderline impossible to hit cap.
---
The server population doesn’t matter. Blizzard know there is going to be a massive surge of population in the first week- 1 month. Then it will slowly die down. If the severs are “full” they can just add more layers to compensate, and remove layers as they need too.
---
Imagine not listening to the game's OST for immersion and following a guide.

MM runs out of mana and had to drink to do comparable dps. BM does not. MM also relies on upgrading weapon regularly. BM can fall behind and it doesn't matter as much. MM can and will pull aggro on its pet if it crits which means feigning or melee, both of which slow things down.
---
Is MM actually better for pvp while leveling? I don't think so. Aimed shot isnt critical at low levels. A beefed up BM pet us a serious threat to any class while leveling and they are forced to choose between dealing with it or chasing the hunter. 
---
BM is way faster and cheaper to level while being equally viable in pvp (though a different playstyle). It's not even close.
---
I swear, put her in the hut next door and people will actually not know where she is

APIs are based on the 8.1.0 client, with some heavy changes. You can check out details here: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.13.2/API_changes
---
Gave me the chills!  Now i really can't fucking wait!!!
---
Is it an actual viewport mod, or is it just artwork overlay?
---
they abuse crossfaction collusion to control worldbosses, black lotus, devilsaur leather and other important farmspots/farms. also they will most likely control the standings in pvp. so if ure not part of APES you wont get any higher than rank10 or 11. 
---
they are really good players imo and if they will be playing on my server i will 100% try to join them.
---
I rerolled ud warlock because of him before BWL release.
---
Can you do something similar to bring a human to Night Elves zone?
---
I think you should read the comment above again
---
"Remember when you had to like... actually talk to other people to do **group** activities".
---
True,  listen to this man.  Some 40 ppl guild,  and everyone on reddit is shitting pants. I wanna be on their server and against them. You can become better only if you play against stronger enemies,  though I doubt I will meet them at all,  maybe few times,  out of HUGE server population.
---
&gt; There can be so many things on an expansion pack loot table that don't invalidate old content.
---
You just avoided answering the question by dumping a huge pile of buzzwords.
---
There's a dude in level 58 levelling greens. There's another dude in BiS Naxx epics. Blizzard needs to sell an expansion pack's worth of content which is worth buying to both of them. How do any of these buzzwords you are dumping solve the problem of letting them both participate in endgame 70 content without the player in greens catching up to the DPS, health, mitigation, avoidance etc. of the player in BiS Naxx gear? The answer is they don't. The xpac had a problem to solve and as a matter of plain mathematical fact no amount of "lateral itemisation" can solve a vertical stratification problem.
---
&gt; So why is it necessary that a hypothetical phase 7 or 8 cannot do the same?
---
Because the game had broken down under its own weight already. Naxx raiders made PvP against everyone else a joke, but only 1% or less of the player base was in Naxx, because the grind to get there and progress there was so arduous. Class balance at Naxx level was fucked because the classes were never designed to scale properly to that gear level. Adding a new layer of ultra-uber-loot which only the 1% could access would only have made all of those things worse.
---
You can only let the population get vertically spread out so far before they need to be squished back together again, otherwise you can't make new content for anyone but the bleeding edge elite, and the bleeding edge elite can't support a MMORPG.
---
Why didnt you get it in colour ? red horde symbol with the blue lion would have looked far better than all black.
---
Can confirm, had a lot of fans on beta so the story checks out.

on r/wow and all the other mmo subreddits too.

lets prove them wrong!
---
try hards that dominated every classic private server
---
Or I could just type classic.wowhead.com and my browser is going to remember it whenever i start typing classic.

I think it's because people have been known for 15 years by that name.

#   Paladin or Priest?
---
Hey there!I'm here with a sort-of dilemma and extra arguments as well as tips/tricks brought by the community might aid me in my decision for a main when Classic rolls in. I'll be playing on a **PVP** server.
---
I've been playing WoW for years now, both Retail and Private servers. I used to play on a server called Feenix and mained a rogue, which later turned into a Holy Priest. I decided to go with something different this time around and thought of leveling a Holy *Paladin*. However, I'm slightly torn. Should I go with something I know such as Priest or stay with the new adventure of leveling a Paladin?
---
Here are some pros and cons I've come up with for each class:
---
**Pros:**
---
* *I am familiar with this class*
---
* *Limited range of gear (i.e. cloth) so I won't have to meddle with anything else*
---
* *Different healing spells such as downgrading ranks, Renew, Prayer of Healing (extremely useful in fights such as Baron Rivendare)*
---
**Cons:**
---
* *Squishy?*
---
\-----------------
---
* *New class, perhaps fun to experience it?*
---
* *Wide variety of armour proficiency*
---
* *Don't have to micro-manage several healing spells*
---
* *BUFFS*
---
* *Might be able to survive World PVP (I will definitely be using Bubble-Hearth)*
---
* *I am not familiar with this class; I'm a bit worried my learning curve will be slightly slower, especially for quick-saving moments in dungeons or World PVP*
---
* *People have told me it's boring to level*
---
* *Flash of Lightx100*
---
* *Having to pay for new armour proficiency come later levels*
---
Any experience you have with this sort of issue, or either of the two classes - I'd love to hear it! Thanks!
---
Make them pick a new name?
---
Yes and?
---
I mean more layers at launch. Servers have a max population regardless of layering.. We don't know how many layers of people they are allowing but we do know that Herod has 10k+ people over that cap atm.
---
Haha,  no.  Read the new post of Blizzard,  stating that these servers will have a lot of players at one time.
---
There's a lot of casual players that will run dungeons. I'm one of them. Especially since it'll be official classic and not a private server.
---
If you choose to level to 60 to find a guild and skip the leveling dungeons then that's on you, but it's pretty dumb to do that and then complain that it's hard to find a group. I have no problem being out in the open world and asking my guild, whispering people and talking in general to find a group while I quest and grind.
---
Allakhazam is the true answer.
---
Mostly they are their retail names , nothing special and nothing worth fighting for
---
No, we don’t get PTO at my Job.
---
I love everything about this. Can you include links to what you have? monitors, joy cons, the lot.
---
Stalagg will have ques too, most people arnt subbing until launch and when they all see a lower pop server as opposed to all the full, they will flood Stalagg..
---
The music clips just makes it hilarious.
---
Haha, yes. I've read the new post. The caps on servers will be MAX 5k, same for layers. The private servers these guys played on had 10-15k at all times.
---
If your guild wants you to no life warrior mt and you can no.life warrior mt you should no life warrior mt.  Warriors are great in group pvp but not as any pve spec.
---
why am I crying in the club rn
---
Still shouldn't be a problem on classic. Anyone can join a channel as far as I remember. If it doesn't exist it creates it.
---
Thanks for doing these.
---
I stopped at WoTLK sooooo wtf is this blue nightelf?
---
Oh okay I thought it's a new theory.
---
Everything you did brought you to where you are now, where you belong, home.
---
You can appear offline
---
But you wont see any additional people on Herod vs Stalagg since there will be layers on both.
---
Xdddd
---
I think what makes this so beautiful is you can see the last 15 years of your life winding back
---
*Doubt*

hahah meanwhile on this sub:

Nah, warmonger is great and let's you shuffle gear around for more crit overall. It's a perfect entry raiding weapon until dm comes out and you can get tarnished rings.
---
&gt; Oh just stfu.
---
Ouch! Must have hit a nerve. A lot of people took it in the past and regretted it. Me being one of them.
---
I’m all for the 3 hour queues anyway. I work from home so can keep myself logged in, ready to play when I want.
---
[I think he's talking about this movie](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1Vnghdsjmd0)

What’s up with that face? It’s not great man.
---
It's a major release happening in a matter of days, of course it's getting attention. Everything else on that list has been out for ages.
---
ultrawide is a replacement for 2 monitors, so some people would still want the functionaity of two monitors.
---
Tested this in every test just to make sure it still works lmao
---
Damn now I gotta swap over.
---
But WoW did something original: They just started from scratch again...
---
...and all the hardcore players and unsubbed casuals are returning again :D
---
You can install it without a sub, on battlenet app go to wow, click the button above play, change it to classic, hit install and just sub on their website the day of, done
---
lol bad.
---
It was confirmed by an APES streamer. 
---
https://m.twitch.tv/videos/467565673
---
I'm rolling on Gehennas aswell but not that worried it will affect gameplay that much. Some of APES activities on pservers were against ToS and Blizzard will be better at enforcing it than pserver admins.
---
I remember walking out the tunnel leaving Booty Bay and a fucking rogue was always waiting outside the tunnel.  Good times getting camped for hours but I miss every minute of it!
---
Nah, a medium server can lose like 60% of its population and still be considered high pop by vanilla standards.
---
&gt; who control the entire servers economy
---
I like how it became a meme and ppl now just make shit up to make it sounds even more scary
---
Until phase 2. With those pop numbers Herod will be layered for years.
---
Take care of your neck. Neck and back problems are no joke.
---
Spoke to my friend (a hunter who played during classic) and he said that guns are viable while levelling, just much more rare with regards to quest rewards/random drops in general. You can craft a few decent guns with the engineering profession too.
---
As others have said though, at endgame it's all crossbows and bows apart from like 1 or 2 guns unfortunately.
---
Wing clip?
---
Those are his ingame sound effects
---
The thing is, retail makes more money per player. Having to buy expansion, option of buying mounts, pets and level boosts, paying through tokens give them 20$ a month instead of 15$ a month, there is more money in retail. When they share subscription, share icon on the battle.net launcher and stuff like that, they are essentially using WoW classic to promote retail. So because of that, they will always run a merged subscription.
---
There are *literally* zero low pop servers period.
---
15% per tick.
---
DotA here to provide TI entertainment right up until classic WoW release
---
To what though? They have basically all the bandages, and ores, etc.
---
Mate,
---
I’ve been hearing you here and there on Countdown to Classic and love all your work and input on that show. 
---
Great video. Keep it up!
---
Lok’tar Ogar, my friend.
---
My life.
---
Totally worth the 15$ to sub early!
---
If you can no life classic then finding the gold to respec for PvP shouldn't be an issue. 
---
Warriors are amazing in PvP once geared, and as MT you will probably be the first priority for gear.
---
Yea but the difference now is that there is a super hyped launch date where everyone will play. That didn't happened in vanilla. sure there was a hyped launch but there was also growth because people didn't know about the game. Plus tourists are a thing now which it wasn't before
---
I'm not surprised, really loved WoW before TBC, WoW changed a lot after that and basically split up the community and made the social aspect more difficult to interact with.  Looking forward to re-rolling my old shaman.
---
They never did. Its dogshit
---
If you want the location of Mankriks wife changed, the quest text should also be changed. Because it states where she is “Gold Road, small Tauren Camp“.
---
Yes, I was one of the few, who actually read the quest texts and didn't need to ask where to go.
---
Nah willow is the biggest oversight
---
Hiya guys! I made another WoW Classic animation! I figured a change of scenery would be nice this time around! :)
---
If you have any feedback or questions, then feel free to let me know here !
---
Hahahaha awesome!!!!
---
I didn't include Innervate as some Ferals seem to use it on themself. Additionally, mana issues for healers aren't really a thing in Molten Core if the other rules of the setup hold (World Buffs, consumables, preraid bis)
---
So you wanna do brd but your in stv the odds on finding a group socially is slim to non. 
---
If your in a guild yeah you probably will get a group but let's face it your going to end up in a shitty social guild where anyone only ever talks when they need something, because you joined a guild advertising in /2 with no application. 
---
You sound like you have never played vanilla and are going solely of the story's of legend tou have been told by people in your guild on retail.
---
Today. It'll get 200 more. 
---
Tomorrow? 200 more!
---
_This_ is what the pvp servers are going to be like IMO.
---
Don't you know that to play vanilla you have to walk backwards uphill two directions in the snow without pants on?
---
You can doubt, but it's true
---
Same with the pcgamer.com community. So fucking ignorant
---
I mean, reading the names of the other games it doesn't seem a bug achievement tbh.
---
Depends how much you want to do it, I know a lot of people who got up, raided, then did their night shift.
---
Yesterday we launched a new discord for our Nordic community over at Gehennas! [https://discord.gg/cy45Gqa](https://discord.gg/cy45Gqa)  
---
Not even one day old and we are soon to hit 800 members!
---
Yes - you have to run up the mountains over by gnomeregon and then jump to your death after you see the zone change to wetlands.
---
No one knows, you can't call speculation a truth.
---
depends what you're used to, playing anything on that much ping feels like absolute shit if you are used to ~20
---
Time stamp? There's almost a 100% chance that whatever he said is just bait. Maitoz (the GM) probably wants to snipe dreamstate so maybe even they aren't certain on the server.
---
Makes a huge difference.
---
This is how I made my original shaman name back in vanilla. Now is has dozens of copies of the same name. I agree, I really don’t get the obsession with the name, but if people have money to spend then why not.
---
Thats just scaremongerin at that point. LIke 80% of what you said is just not true.
---
Here is a [Photo](https://imgur.com/a2tMB1N) , Sadly he is a little beat up :(
---
Who has time to build a paradise when there is Classic Wow to play?
---
its proven fact that when they merged realms in past it killed the entire game.
---
\^is a lie
---
APEs is a super toxic guild. They only care about themselves and will do anything to get ahead.
---
Ehh 2070 is a not as good as it gets. 2 2080 in nvlink is on another level.
---
Did you read any of the rage threads after name registration? 
---
A lot of WoW players are pathologically convinced that the only person in the universe entitled to use their handle is them. They are Dafuq, and everyone else who ever called themselves Dafuq is an impostor and a name thief.
---
So of course they all rushed to the highest pop server to try to register "their" name before someone else "stole" it.
---
Make sure to use wine-staging for wow, the default wine version the lutris script gave me was not working. (MX150, proprietary driver)
---
Damn :(
---
Nope, Blizzard clearly indicated in that post Herod will have queues at launch. Do you believe they will spin up unlimited layers for a server?
---
I think we are saying the same thing essentially but with different words. Layering does increase capacity but the ultimate point of layering is to have a healthy long term population. For that you need to have a high capacity at the start. Hence layering is needed.
---
Seriously.
---
"You think you do, but you don't"
---
Now he is running the show.
---
Blizzard doesn't have to use queues because of technical limitations, they are a tool to help distribute population evenly.
---
God. Grinding out in eastern plaguelands. My first character, I had almost no clue what I was doing. It was hell.
---
i see you want authentic classic experience right there
---
No, there's not a chance that blizzard will allow 10k or more people per layer. Not. A. Chance. Their cap always used to be around 3k.
---
No
---
You're fucking thick if you can't figure out that the content in later phases is raids *when the only new content is raids*. 
---
I get that you're frothing at the mouth trying to defend your mistake but just stop.
---
That's a pro tip. Thank you!
---
I think everyone already thought of what he's saying lol
---
No only raid quests can be completed in a raid group. You won’t get credit for anything else.
---
I think cross faction collusion was a private server thing though. The horde on gehennas already announced they will fight them. And im not even sure blizzard would allow collusion like that.
---
Don’t think the devilsaur mafia will exist like it did  on private servers.
---
It's not like the dota 2 international with the biggest prize in gaming history is on the whole week and weekend.
---
Great thought I wasn't.
---
Any update on this judgement?
---
As someone that's going to play a human warlock.....well  at least I know what I'm headed into.  
---
It will be like I'm that skinny guy in Predator without Arnold and the rest of the team.
---
It doesn't scale after max level. That's why hunter dps is so low and hunters become gear dependent for pvp once everyone is out of blues.
---
I wanne see dunkan tank this dungeon  
---
very nice content will wait for next part
---
Yeah also true. People should just ignore everything they read about APES because it can just be fake/bait.
---
no, my alts used to work at ~~uranium~~ thorium mines, run dungeons to supply my main with gold
---
Holy crap man this tattoo 'artist' is awful, horrible lines. Also why is part of the bowstring missing? Lol.
---
Design is alright but 1/10 execution.
---
MM is completely viable. Go by how you want to play. I leveled to 60 in vanilla pretty easily in MM spec.
---
Read my other reply please. There are other ways of restricting bots than scamming your community out of money...
---
I payed $15 god damn dollars just to reserve my name. Then stayed up til 4am and remade the character with the proper appearance. My best friend had his birthday party yesterday, which was literally only for the Classic wow Guild  Members. We had WoW Trivia and a bunch of other shit. I'm pretty sure I think I want it.
---
As someone who hasn’t played wow since Vanilla, a little TBC and was 11-12 at the time, I kinda forgot about addons and how they work so I have a few questions.
---
Are there any risks of getting banned? I don’t intend to use anything too strange, just curious.
---
Is there a good registry for them? Like with reviews, bug reports, etc (or is that all just on github or something)?
---
And speaking of github does anyone have any experiencing developing addons? If so could you point me towards any good guides/documentations for starting off developing them?
---
Don't forget layering. Just because the server has more players, doesn't mean you will have more players on your layer.
---
The reason they have less servers (and that the servers are so full) is because of this tech. They are directly linked.
---
Noo
---
When will they go down? I plan to create my character next weekend. Hopefully the servers won't be down at that time.
---
That would require OP to have made this instead of stealing it from whoever originally posted it several months ago.
---
Sounds like Marfans
---
Hell mine goes to bed and I'm logging in for classic
---
Who knows, does it actually flag you for PVP when you kill those mobs in beta?
---
*ooooooommmmm*
---
Where is this?
---
What class are you irl?
---
Who?
---
39-40 should be the longest, especially when you have enough gold saved up for your mount. It’s like an eternity
---
Haven't followed it recently what is it like now? I know it got bought out by Tencent or something, which I kind of imagined would have some negative implications.
---
Pretty sure the want for private server started to truly gain steam near the end of Wotlk, the introduction of LFD, the 4 raid difficulties for an instance and the first major content draught all kinda contributed to this, nothing particular happened in cataclysm until once again the end of the expansion where they added LFR, 3 shit dungeons and also the following content draught but made worse by Dragonsoul not being as well liked as other end tier raids. The biggest single rise for classic servers was in WoD where the game hit one of it's lowest points and had another content draught with the fucking selfie patch, the first big rise was at the end of wotlk with a big rise happening at the end of nearly every following xpac. In short there is no reason to state that Cata was the reason for the rise in demand of private servers.
---
Found it while browsing reddit on the phone app
---
At 35 you're only 1/3 of the way there, at 45 barely halfway. This is a pretty typical XP scale, or was for the era anyway. The estimates I've seen for actual time played to reach 60 are in the range of 5 days for speedrunners, more like 10 days for casual or ineffecient leveling.
---
In the grand scheme, I guess 240 hours just to hit the level cap on one character seems like a lot; what's the last game you played for 250+ hours in a single run, right? But even some relatively modern games require similar played times to max out. When it first released, the typical 1-50 played for SWTOR was over 100 hours, and that didn't seem so awful at the time. It's been massively shortened since then, but I had multiple alts long before the leveling reforms. Maxing out CP in ESO probably takes more than this now; the nominal level 50 cap there is really just the end of the tutorial, and doing all of the available story content also takes quite a long while. Same for FFXIV if you want to max out all jobs and finish the story, which is legendary for the amount of time it takes to slog through.
---
That's not to mention much older titles, early 2000s era, where the grind could be an order of magnitude longer than this. My first MMO was Anarchy Online, and, being a dumbass and having no idea at all what I was doing, it took me around 2,200 hours played before I had my first (and only) character leveled up to the cap (220, but the way XP worked in that game it was more like 400-500 levels in reality), and only halfway respectably geared.
---
In that context, it's easy to see why WoW was panned as the ultimate "casual" MMO when it came out. And looking at it from the perspective of having done all this over again in more games than I care to admit, this seems fine.
---
Hey man the way I look at it.. free honor :)
---
See, I'm doing the opposite. I'm staying inside with as little activity as possible. That way when I start to veg out, it won't shock my system and I'll already be used to it.
---
Which ones are English, German, French?
---
That's the stress test though. I wasn't a part of any of them but I don't see why people would dedicate time to actually levevling during a stress test rather than just logging in and walking around doing whatever in the starting zones
---
It was nice of them to extend the stress test a few extra days through the weekend, but I really wish the level cap was higher than 15. I played enough to level 2 and a half characters to 15, and I would've preferred to have dumped all that time into just 1 character, take it to 20-25.
---
No not even he thinks that he could take the top prize this time around.
---
You are safe in your faction's territory where all of the lower level quests are located.  Once you hit around level 20 though, you will have to start questing in contested territory.  As the name implies, in contested territorry you are automatically flagged for pvp.  Anyone from the opposite faction will be able to attack you.  It's also important to know that, if you attack the opposite faction in your territorry, they can then attack you.  Hunters will sometimes lure lower level players into attacking them by making their pet act like a quest NPC.
---
the ticks take forever.
---
I don’t really like it sorry..
---
FIRE UP MSDOS BOYS
---
It’s going to be fine dude, just let launch happen and servers will fill out and then die down after many leave first few weeks, I wouldn’t stress on it
---
Great as a leveling pet. Cats are objectively better (assuming you get the ones with faster attack speeds), but stylistically boar charge is a lot of fun.
---
well, all other mmo's except pantheon which follow directly the line of game develop concept of classic wow except greatly expanding on it, in a timeline where blizzard would have to progressively keep making the game good to not have pantheon be a amazing success
---
Yeah I believe for the most part the retail tourists aren´t even there yet. The population drops will happen mostly on new servers from now on.
---
They should honestly do exactly like they runescape did it with OSRS
---
Any source for this because I can't imagine casuals beating pros in Overwatch, ever. Even if you don't look at pros, there are plenty of videos showing high ranked played 3/4v6 lower ranked players similar to league of legends.
---
PvP is kinda the reason i'm wanting to roll rogue and not mage/priest.. Love the days of 2 shotting drinking mages!
---
Wait for release. Once launch is up and people want to play the overflow will steadily trickle over to the other servers. Gehennas is gonna be full as well.
---
I know some people don't like Valve, but their cash flow from Steam really lets games stick to their original design. CSGO and DotA have really stuck to their guns for a long time and it's why they are so great.
---
There’s a list on the Blizz forums for Discords, but it’s not complete for various reasons. The OP is trying to add in as many as she can and give unbiased advertisements to all. You can as your Server Reddit for a Discord link, and see if they have one. You can also search r/classicwow for Discords and there’s a few threads with links.
---
Have they updated Risk of Rain much since launch? I had a great time with it, but became stale very quickly. I know it's early access, just wondering if it's worth another look.
---
Yeah it felt like this for me when i pushed to 100 on path of exile. You see the exp bar move and it cant go backwards or restart. Felt real nice pushing 59-60. But the 55-59.... feels grim.
---
No way! This should be fake.
---
I honestly wish they would put up a disclaimer of sorts saying that everyone should be ready and willing to have their server merged if it gets below a certain threshold of daily logins, or at least be able to vote on it. They could also...if they are truly concerned about server community's, make transfers free if your pops dry up on any given server etc.
---
Blizz needs to be ok with closing/merging a server in the future.
---
It was fun, and the massive kiting abilities of Hunters was imba.
---
There are times when WotF would be useful in PvE (pretty much the same times that Fear Ward is useful).
---
Based on your own criteria though, it's as you say, you're out of options.
---
They camp children’s favorite streamer and have a good set of time in their hands which give them the ability to farm a lot of honor for rank 10+, a lot of server economy control, etc. 
---
They’re considered by many as a toxic guild but they are a blast to watch. If you play on their server, you’ll definitely encounter them at one point harassing others on their server. I’m personally a fan of them though so i might be biased. 
---
Meh.
---
LoL ARAM. I can't stand the base game anymore, but ARAM is just fantastic.
---
Ouch bro, ouch. This is the true classic experience tho.
---
It's more of a guarantee versus a possibility. I always went for high pop servers in MMOs and never regretted it in the long term.
---
I haven't forgotten that at all, care to tell me why you believe that matters though?
---
I live in Denmark, and it's probably more expensive for me to travel to Copenhagen than the cheapest plane ticket from Copenhagen to London, by train it's the prices to go to Berlin as it is to go to Copenhagen.
---
I got the name on grobbulus
---
This is in no way saying it's a top tier idea or anything, but I used to be an MT who also did PVP. I kept anything with good Str and Block and had a blast being an immortal shield slam bot. Time-to-kill was abysmal but it was super fun just annoying the hell out of people (obviously best done with some back up..)
---
blood elf it looks like
---
Tbh, Allen Brack's responce there is kinda why he should never have become a game producer in the 1st place :D He did similar things to Star Wars Galaxies... just not understanding why people play MMO RPG's to begin with.
---
He must be a great manager though, to rise through the ranks to become President of blizzard. I wonder if that has anything to do with the lack of marketing and hype buildup for classic now that i think of it. I mean really, how hard would it be for Blizzard to make something like Hurricane did.. all they need to do is edit some old trailers, perhaps use unused scenes from em... and put epic music on it :P
---
They won’t hit 60 in two days on classic
---
talking out of your ass
---
I don't think this is true, blizz said to expect 10k+ as a conservative estimate on herod launch.
---
It's fine except the R14 weapons aren't particularly good, so you can safely stop at 13. The R10 set has a nonsensical amount of crit on it. The set bonuses are solid as well.
---
You know you hit rock bottom when the guy who doesn't start his sentence with a capital letter calls your post low effort.         
---
Yes I'm not perfect either, but you guys do you guys!
---
Because they want to avoid exactly that.  Merging realms is never a good look for an MMO.  They wanted a solution for that and expect the drop off to be far far worse than on retail
---
The troll racial is actually really negligible and worse than it sounds, undead will of the forsaken might be a lifesaver as a mage if you're on a world PvP server, they also have a higher base intellect although that's quite negligible. If playing horde I'd say pick for looks tbh or undead if you're pvp
---
Most PVP servers tend to have a 50/50 split, at least at launch. The PVE servers tend to be more polarizing.
---
I posted this same thing last night, and I all I got was downvotes and something about him streaming the whole run for months. Deleted thread. Glad yours is doing better, I could watch Joana do his thing all day.
---
Clearly you don't have the mentality for a PvP server, and that's fine - just stop bitching lol.
---
Oh. I dunno. I've never had a problem using it. Certainly gives me more access to people on the server of I need to advertise for a dungeon or something
---
If you are doing the bare minimum, arrows are cheap. But if you want to be competing on the damage meters you will need thorium arrows. It all depends on your server economy but they are something you have to farm some gold for weekly. If you are an engineer (which you 100% should be as a hunter), you can buy the mats and make them pretty easily which ends up being cheaper.
---
Ummm “laughs” rekt. there is a reason I play paladin and warlock
---
What server they going to be on?
---
Not really, becuase you can easily swap between 2 single and 1 ultra wide at a click of a finger.
---
My friend doesn't get it.
---
I hope not, Germans are cool and the French are alright, but keep Ruskis out of my Bgs please.
---
I do :)
---
I have to wonder - how do they know what realm people are going to play on? There are 3 PVP servers, and 3 characters available. I therefore have a character on all 3 servers. So, that isn't exactly useful information for them.
---
So
---
Well no. If you assume a certain % of players will drop of after X months, then adding more and more layers will result in a net increase in the number of remaining players post-layering. So while adding more layers technically would be doable, it doesn’t make sense for a server long term, as the total number of players who remain will be greater than the non-layered server maximum.
---
&gt;	a very full and active realm
---
So like every other realm option? Why are you Herod people so stubborn to switch? Enjoy your hour long queues/ice cold hypothermia water while all the other realms will have just as many people on their layers.
---
Agreed, I just found it odd that while Northshire was so packed that people could really only progress by grouping up and being lucky with a first hit on a Kobold, to being empty in the 2nd zone.
---

---
Here is the fair well video from APES as they make their way to classic.
---
The only people who are going to stick around are those who played it back in the day. People who have never played it before are going to try it out of curiosity, then quit once they realize how much of a grind levelling is. Don't get me wrong I'm hype as FUCK and will be playing it for years to come but I'm under no disillusion about how steep the drop-off will be shortly after launch.
---
Who sheep’s a pet??
---
Don't know how realistic aoe farming is given the server population.
---
Alenya and Umbra have an alliance guide I believe, specially made for classic, and they are racing first to 60 on launch
---
I don’t get why the rude comments. If you don’t like it, move on. 
---
Your tattoo interpretation of Sylvannas was interesting to see her in that perspective. I’m glad you like it! Do you prefer tattoos in this style or have you ever thought about realism?
---
&gt;Are there any risks of getting banned? I don’t intend to use anything too strange, just curious.
---
&gt;Is there a good registry for them? Like with reviews, bug reports, etc (or is that all just on github or something)?
---
Tou can get them from curse (through twitch app if you prefer) and you can read reviews and sort by popularity)
---
Chances are you'll be using it almost always at full health which results in 10% haste. That is not enough for an extra frostbolt.
---
Definitely. I have my wife's name on reserve on my account and when she subs I'll pass it to her.
---
1000IQ mages
---
Is it that much faster if you're stuck swimming it? Assuming you can do the normal route without dying  to mobs.
---
I hope it IS like that. That was classic. If you don't want classic, stick to your garbage current easy mode face roll baby version filled with dickheads who don't communicate.
---
2 options : 
---
- The button will turn red
---
- The servers will go off and on again
---
This. I expect to see a lot of Warlocks during launch.
---
Stat priority for leveling is ALWAYS stamina. A lot of people here are posting agi as biggest priority, but you just don't scale well from agi until at least lvl 60 blues. In fact your pet will be doing most of your damage.
---
I would say stam&gt;int=spirit&gt;agi. for a pvp server. For pve, staying high on health doesn't really matter that much and you can probably just glass cannon stack agi.
---
Lets say 90% of the million resubs quit.
---
That's 900,000 people who quit and 100,000 people who stay.
---
12 servers.  5,000 per server.  That's 60,000 people.
---
*We're still 40,000 people short with server capacity.*
---
Not true.  Layering dramatically increases concurrency on each realm for the time it exists, and shortens queue times.
---
That is indeed the named mob he tames at level 25.
---
Well, my internet can't run YouTube without making WoW lag, but Spotify would probably work I haven't tried. Bit awkward to search for different playlists every time I walk into a new zone or town though, I was already just using Windows Media Player on extracted WoW music files.
---
Figured i'd try my luck at requesting an addon, but looking at the up/down vote ratio I guess it isn't an addon people want
---
HEATHEN
---
I will notify the paladin police force of this immediately.
---
Err sure let’s go with that
---
And left almost immediately
---
I want my husband to bring me sweets :(
---
Venruki was proved wrong and so many other people will be proved wrong. 9 MORE DAYS
---
That game was the greatest thing
---
To get into a server of how many? 10k? 30k, 50k? Vs. what is a medium pop realm? 3k, 5k? 
---
Only getting some of the numbers doesn't mean anything.
---
This game is legendary.  Have you played the second one?
---
2-8 pm pst equals 5-11pm est which seems to be right in the sweet spot for est raiding.

Think he means teamfight tactics lol
---
if you're a dota fan times are fucking great
---
People are downvoting this guy but hes more correct than everyone posting agi. Stacking minor amounts of damage while leveling is pretty useless. Regen and uptime is what is key for leveling.
---
Arguably all choices have good sides- troll is probably the weakest in pvp, orc has stun resist, undeads wotf, and tauren have warstomp for a free stun. Beserking isnt strong enough to warrant saying its the pve choice, so its really a pvp and qol decision.
---
Yup. I remember being PM'd  as a druid asking if I wanted to tank or heal a dungeon quite frequently.  It's nice getting to know people and making "local" friends.
---
The stun resist is a lot more than "Mildly" better.
---
No, it's because of layering. If you were seeing the trade posts, people are there.
---
I think you’re correct - those are just the stats in my 8 man rl wow playing friend group.
---
There are also alot of people saying that 90% of the people who have reserved names are retail players so alot of the numbers were seeing are tourists - well out of the four of us friends who have name reserved NONE of us had an active sub for BFA.
---
Except your aren't allowed to use it on pull because you will get too much aggro and that 10-30% casting speed does jack shit when you run out of mana early.

Fire Emblem 3H
---
This video is legit the best world of warcraft video ever made.
---
LMAO was about to just comment this. Get me out of that hippie nightmare.
---
Being undead is useful on a number of encounters. Magmadar, nefarian, gluth come to mind and a couple others too.
---
ITT: No one seems to understand the difference in population cap and concurrency cap, which are two entirely different (but related) things.
---
Priest is probably a solid choice for me.
---
For some reason the priest class fantasy never really called out to me as much but I love casters and healing.
---
Isnt fire the pve spec?
---
* Epic gear has a real value. It is either extremely hard to earn or you need to be extremely lucky. Most often it requires both. This is the same reason D2 is so loved and D3 is not. 
---
* Classes, races and talent builds had unique benefits and downsides. You had to prioritize.
---
 In contrast to modern wow where every class and build has almost been designed to fit every role, and every class almost feels the same to play.
---
* Vanilla had a much more living world because we did not have flying and could not be teleported to dungeons. Most classes also had mechanics that required you to have certain proffessions in order to get the most out of your class. This was also a factor for the economy and community.   
---
+++
---
I think Pantheon is closer to EQ than classic WoW.  Also still really far away unfortunately.  That being said classic WoW is far closer to pantheon than retail WoW is.
---
Sounds like you should switch to horde
---
uhhh, i just checked my old server, it has a grand total of 500 players, 120 on alliance (my side) and the rest horde.
---
That seems pretty low pop considering there are servers with 12,000 players on alliance side alone.
---
This sub sometimes man yikee
---
I've loved watching this a couple times in the past and I'm glad he's doing this re-run to line up with launch. I hope he does as well with his guides as he did back in the day. Unlike a lot of modern gaming "personalities" he seems like he's just a regular guy who knows a shit lot about the game and puts in a ton of work sharing it.
---
I have Noobslayer on Gehennas
---
Want a name on Golemagg
---
I agree but mind you the retail tourists also had the opportunity to reserve their name as well
---
It will be expensive.
---
Good thing blizzard never invented dual-classing. Imagine the horror of trying to pick one of the possible 23092953 combinations.
---
Why? It's on a VESA mount.
---
They still have a set amount of players on each server. Blizzard is expecting queue times of 10000+ meaning it will most likely be around 25000 in queue. On launch that means times of 5+ hours just to get inside to play.
---
There's going to be one big zerg following the Joana guide. If you haven't got your lvling down by now, good luck to you!
---
Don't see any issue with that statement though? Plenty of people believe that the game will have a massive up take early on and that players will leave on mass after a few weeks. I personally don't but its a legitimate thing to believe. Wildstar been the gold standard for this, needing a huge amount of new servers on launch. Having a massive player base and then been all but dead after 8 or so weeks.
---
Does anyone else remember getting 'stuck' in the 30s? 
---
I do. I exhausted all of the quests I had and to grind. It felt like it took forever!!
---
I can't wait though.
---
Why am I crying?
---
Is that a joke? Are you really calling someone out for a capital letter?
---
Nice dude, you've really excelled yourself this time. Been here 10 years but gonna call a dude out on your favourite sub just for a capital letter.
---
I think the approach to say that you'll be rich as a mage because of aoe farming is ok but you'll be not using the engineering profession until you can actually aoe farm so might aswell have mining until then. Also not sure how realistic aoe farming is given how crowded servers are. If you have mining yourself it's in your own hands to get the materials for engineering. There are skill guides that list which materials you need exactly to reach 300. Having mining also doesn't stop you from aoe farming so if that turns out to be the better approach you can still do that.
---
Hey man are you working on your 1-6 route video?
---
have fun ya sweaty virgin =)
---
You can save Spotify songs locally so that when they play, it doesn't use any bandwidth.
---
It's just a request to make an AddOn that breaks some of the magic of Vanilla. The music is part of what made it so amazing. Also, I don't think it's possible to override the base game music. There are script commands that will play different sound files in game on demand, but it still plays all the sounds currently being output in the game.
---
its like people think they are the only no life hardcore guild, every pvp server will have many guilds like them
---
He can aoe farm DM east by himself just don’t know how much money he will make
---
My crying?
---
Hes an Activision boot licker.
---
It will be expensive as it will be rare at first. The actual gold needed though would be less due to people having less money and inflation not really kicking in yet.
---

Anyone who pays for a 60 can go suck on a Disgusting Oozling.
---
Ignore the limits bud.  Those are clearly just to demonstrate the math and make it easy to understand.  The point was the math.
---
Before people freak the fuck out, this is an ad for powerleveling services (which is still bad) not a level 60 boost sold by blizz.
---
A medium pop is more than the most full server in vanilla, yes they're being vague, but they are definitely giving us some information.
---
Oh yeah, I love this!
---
I love what Hurricane did for the vanilla-WoW private server community, hyping us up for years.
---
Yes expensive but as a mage you should be able to afford it.
---
You can't really go with fire till AQ opens. Frost is best up to that point.
---
Go for a laptop with minimum of 8gb ram, pref a 8th gen i5 or i7. A stand alone gpu like the ones that are in the laptops you linked. The laptip MUST have a ssd it makes a helluva difference. All else is up to you like screen size etc but try not to get anything under 14 inch with less than 1080p resolution if you plan to game in it for longer periods of time. Smaller than that will be a pain.

He's some sort of retail elf that didn't exist back in the good ol days. One of Blizzard's frankenstein creations that you'll never find in original Warcraft lore predating Cataclysm.
---
Whoa partner, I didn't start the fire.
---
Get a swing timer addon and use hamstring to stay out of range between your hits (wish I knew this back in Vanilla). Obviously, you want a big 2h for this tactic. I'd suggest Arms (f.ex. 31/5/15, with the prot talents last).
---
Research important weapon upgrades throughout the lvling process (be realistic in terms of drop rates). Keep your weapon skills somewhat updated in case you get a good upgrade of a different type. 
---
I strongly recommend Mining. Lvling Engi early has its pros and cons. It's costly and takes a slot, but at the same time offers tools to ease what could otherwise be very difficult (stun grenades, target dummy, etc). Enchanting also has its use if you are doing lots of dungeons (enchant your own/party gear, disenchanting BoP drops).
---
Learn the basics of stance-switching macros sooner rather than later (like def stance + equip shield + shield bash). Do as much dungeons as possible, both for tank practise and the benefit of playing with a group.
---
What? The queues will happen because there *is* a cap.
---
Hi, yeah I got to finish off the route and record it at the end of the open beta. Im horrible at editing so im hoping the sped up clips ive put in work properly.
---
Its a 40 min run so im trying to cut the video down as short as I can make it.
---
Good analogy.
---
Well, if it is a scam - it's ok. But if Blizzard did it - I'd be done with that company in no time.
---
The beacons are lit. Azeroth calls for aid
---
I played on Stormreaver at launch which was not nearly as full as some but still had a queue for several days after launch.  Basically enter queue .. see estimate ... go watch TV or something and check back every 20-30 mins to see if I was getting close.
---
Never played vanilla and started during Warlords, in 2015, so I feel pretty blind. I've leveled a bit on retail through the older zones, but having played the stress tests almost nothing is the same except the names, so I don't feel like I really know much of anything about how the game was back then. I feel pretty lucky getting to experience it as a new (to me) game since I missed out back in the day.
---
I remember tanking with my warrior in vanilla. This would happen about every other group. 
---
You'd get someone that would spam their highest aggro abilities as soon as the fight would start. On the add that you are **not** meant to be focusing on......
---
Shazz = No APES
---
Gehennas = APES
---
Don't think you'll be dancing around that pole for long.
---
The answer is flying mounts and smaller worlds. It takes a player a minute of semi-afk flying in a straight line to arrive at any destination in Outland or Northrend. It is a menial task with no sense of adventure, so you might as well port and be done with it.
---
I think only the face is different.
---
They havent domminated evey server lol
---
Yeah, so far we can only speculate. 
---
What I am wondering is how the game experience will be after they remove layering. 
---
That’s why I was wondering how it was on a really crowded realm back then, I know it won’t be a accurate comparison. 
---
But as you said, maby the private servers come closer to the truth.
---
So here is a smart idea: Move NOW, and you don't need to worry about it.
---
whats your synonym then, cmon were waiting
---
Thank you, I was beginning to wonder what the hell "APES" were and hadn't seen the word "guild"
---
I did. Also to log in and say hi to old characters. To see how broken the game is. Tried rolling a new char and was mounted within a few hours.
---
You could get a decent desktop and a good monitor for better price.
---
The PlayMusic command actually overrides the currently playing music, so this is supported by the game. I agree the music is part of what makes this game so amazing, but you can't tell me you don't get tired of listening to Plains\_01, 02, and 03 after Mulgore, Barrens, Thousand Needles, Desolace, and Stonetalon Mountains. Hence why I mentioned a "Faithful" pack that stayed true to that, just [listen to this for a few minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8PqlJBeuT0). There's also [Durotar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejqUoPoyUg8), [Feralas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w-lfD5Jngg), [Tanaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qIttZLLq4), a couple [new PvP tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1moapLIZm-g) to add more variety to the existing ones, new [Elwynn Forest music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7p-hqRz7cw) (though i'd just leave the original track in personally), and one of my favorites [Arathi Highlands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_9jqf9e0eA) (though it is the least-Classic, it would probably not be in the "Faithful" pack)

If need be i'll be manually using Windows Media Player because I already have it set up. I'll just keybind my Music Mute key and manually play playlists for a zone or whatever when i'm in it, then pause it and re-enable music when i'm in caves and such. I was just hoping an AddOn could be easily made instead
---
Aww yea figure prints!  You had to win the random lottery to even order one due to their capacity vs demand. I got lucky and got one of my full T5 Human Prot Warrior.

Boars are great if you wanna be able to feed your pet literally anything you want, as they can eat bread, fruits, mushroom, meat and basically any food source.
---
Cats deal better DPS as they attack faster and hold more threat
---
Your choice is between easier combat/levelling and convenience

Of course. These hundreds of guilds with hundreds of members each, what a farfetched idea it is that a large portion of them will materialize.
---
Shit IS dope....everyone saying it's lame has no tattoos or is against it and wanna put u down lmao...bunch of bitch ass toxic wow players out there. Do u , I think it pops out and looks dope but once again who care what anyone think but you

Just received this from a friend, video from Joana https://youtu.be/Xtty9M4kaoo

It's a cash grab of 6 bucks x all the people who paid. It's a multimillion dollar cash grab more likely.
---
Will there be a queue even with layering? I'm not really familiar with how it works.
---
There was no fire until you called someone out for a capital letter.
---
Sounds like you er...
---
Sounds Like You Did To Me? See What I DiD TheRe?
---
I'm really sorry for your lost man. He would 100% absolutely love to hear that hes in your mind when you're playing classic.
---
Oh hey, someone who correctly names it "LFD" instead of calling it "lfg" like everyone else seems to. Nice.
---
Bookmark is even easier.
---
According to the blue post, Herod with 30% of it's players is probably still an overcrowded server when layering ends.  If a medium is bigger than any Vanilla server ever, then High must be like twice that, and Full with 10k+ queue times?  It must be like bigger than any BC server ever was, maybe like 20-30k.  30% of that is probably still a medium pop server bigger than any Vanilla server ever was.
---
It won't be difficult to find a laptop that can run classic wow, but seeing as you're gonna throw down $1000cad on it I would consider looking beyond 'can it run classic'.
---
Maybe try posting in r/laptops or /suggestalaptop. Also, r/suggestalaptop has a [2019 updated buyer's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/85xevt/best_laptop_recommendations_2018_guide_for/), with a section on gaming laptops.
---
You only use so many in order to level up. Don’t need that many compared to how much trogs/trolls give you.
---
It won’t let you straight search for the classic folder in world of Warcraft?? That’s how I pulled my Classic game to load Twitch addons.
---
obviously it is not blizzard
---
A writer made this one up.
---
19 here as well, I've played WoW with my dad since 2005 and betchyersweetass we're excited to play Classic again
---
I think *Thex and Candy* wins.
---
I made this point previously in this sub and got downvoted for it. 
---
Server technology is way different to what it used to be. When Blizzard first launched WoW, the servers were still emerging from the era of being identifiable as units of hardware. Now with cloud scale, realms are autoscaling VM or containerized microservice clusters that have virtual cores and the "server" is just a load balanced endpoint. They could effectively have ONE server if they wanted to and it would make no difference.
---
The *number* of servers is somewhat irrelevant and a relic of the past - it's just a virtual representation of something and is only really there to provide all the variants (PVP, PVE, RP PVP, RP PVE, language specific realms etc.)
---
I only played for the first week of launch but I believe it has had a decently large update with new weapons and I think new maps.  I might check it out while waiting for classic.
---
That's just my own personal knowledge based on the overwhelming amount of gathered information and life experience. No sources, because they most probably didn't say that using exactly the same sequence of words. Cheers!
---
Blackrock is where the pvp endgame happens. I can´t imagine how streamer raids want to pass that area in phase 2. Same with Silithus later. You can get so much fame by fucking up their raids in front of thousands of viewers. This is the main reason why I regret not rolling on a streamer server.
---
Okay I'm sensing you are kind of a bitch, so I'm gonna leave you at this.

---
Seriously,,,paragraph if you want people to read that.
---
But anyways, it took me 6 attempts over 2 days for blizz to process my cc. My stuff is fine, there pay server is not.
---
10k in queue goes fast. Don’t see the issue. I could complain about it daily on reddit, but I have better things to do. 
---
Fold your laundry while you’re in the queue.
---
Just adding servers to account for the massive influx of players will kill the game guaranteed. It's how Wildstar died. Every single game goes through a honeymoon period after which a huge percentage leave. After those leave, many servers die as they don't have a population to sustain them and then eventually the game dies due to the same issue.
---
I know you've read this before, why do you keep saying the same stupid shit?
---
They're trying to make sure you don't play on a dead server.
---
I would dispute this to some extent. Given the amount of information and guides available to the average players these days, hunters will feel the hit in BWL (once enough gear has dropped for their guild) not after BWL.
---
I mained a hunter in vanilla and 2 on private servers. During vanilla I was top DPS all the way up to nef. On private servers though, the average player had access to more information, so the overall dps output from the guild was higher. Even when squeezing everything the class has to offer you still can't compete with above average rogues/warriors (and casters once they get enough gear).
---
Hunters make themselves useful in AQ and NAXX with pulling, pet pulling(this is a big one for AQ) and kiting. There is always reason to bring a couple. But the myths around hunters came about because the demand for the class was low, and in vanilla hunter was the most popular class (and most poorly played/understood).
---
So yeah, I'd paint more of a grim picture of DPS meters in BWL than you do, but I'm not really arguing with you either.
---
If people plan on maining hunter, your plan should be to always be on top of your utility skills in raids, make yourself proactively useful, that way when DPS starts to get shit, you will still be in demand from a good raid leader.
---
It did let me search. Which folder do I need to direct it to? Looks like the classic umbrella folder is called \_classic\_. Do I direct it there, or to the actual executable that opens the game, or to the addons folder?
---
have a look at borderlines89 on Instagram to see some real masterpieces just from a pen
---
I'm the kind of person that finds a song I like and listen to it in repeat and don't get sick of it until the next song is found. 
---
The question is, can the PlayMusic command access files outside of the core game files? Editing the game files is against TOS so the Add-on would need to also store these sound files somewhere else. Not only does this create a gigantic add-on, but it might also not be possible because it's not a core sound file.

Ok :)

"people's attitudes to it" is literally part of the state of online discourse... How are you gonna state an example of someone's online discourse such as the ridiculous concept of misgendering a game avatar being used to report someone in one breath, and then say it hasn't changed much in the next breath? Are you thinking clearly, here?
---
I've been on the net since 1992, and before that on local and nationwide BBS communities. It is so much worse today, and the reasons are likely multi-faceted, including just the sheer number of people.

---
What?  Of course Blizzard knows it’s 100% correct that’s because they have reference numbers to compare to... YOU SAID THIS IN YOUR OWN POST!
---
my guy!
---
I am in this exact boat.
---
I hardcore tanked back in the day. i was like.. THE OFFTANK but was with main tank shit. 
---
now im like. ahh shit here we go again...but i don't think i want the same exp twice.
---
It feels like to me like playing a game for the different ending and somehow with the choices i made getting the same ending and im like...wait i chose this person to die or but i did the extra collect quest should i not get the 2nd ending....
---
but now im like..well i remember being a warrior and having my ass melted off by SP all the time... maybe i want to try that out..feel the opposite of a warrior..b ut fuck man... 
---
arms warrior in AV is sick as fuck.. charge in WHAMO 2k hit then bam Ex-him.
---
but ... do i want that same ending again........
---
pvp with a warrior is fun, but the casters will always look fun .... your there bashing 12345 and stance dancing .. they are doting and killing... and fuck... my fingers are 34 years old now... i spend more time gutting deer then playing wow.... so....
---
i think i  personly have to take it easy..but
---
i know your pain... if you wanna bs more about this please hit me up.
---
Yeah it's not blizzard, it's your typical 3rd party shady websites, pretty sure they'll run rampant with gold selling a bit after release
---
Golemagg gang busy discussing politics, financial trends, innovations in particle physics, sipping sherry and polishing monocles.
---
Very cool, mdsionvaoirnd.
---
Why move after launch.
---
They are urging you to move now and once the new realm reaches full, they will open another and so on.
---
Blizzard is literally handing out a bone to people and you're all too stubborn to take it.
---
It depends on the stage of the game and the gearing. 
---
Assuming equal gearing:
---
If you are both in blues, kite them and win.
---
If you are in epics, kite them until either of you get bored and stop fighting.
---
Well, technically, you can go see the high elf empire in the well of eternity dungeon. Like five minutes before everything exploded.
---
A typical PvE rogue build would be  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005323105-3210052020050150231](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005323105-3210052020050150231)   
---
It's not perfect for PvP but it is still really good, a lot of fun, and you don't need to respec!
---
Grinding Murlocs in Hillsbrad on a PvP server will have you corpse running more than killing Murlocs.
---
Who knows? You’ll have to wait and see. I suspect the majority of players aren’t on Reddit and when they log in for the first time they will look for a server that is high but not full.
---
It’s entirely possible blizz will launch the game with additional servers.
---
&gt;This is like saying "The game's not out yet but everyone knows it'll suck"
---
No, it's saying "Classic has been negatively impacted by decisions to promote retail". With a separate sub, layering would not have been necessary.
---
&gt; The sub is for both games so people can go between the versions without hesitation. Retail people can try classic without losing money and people who end up not liking classic will just swap to retail and check out all the new stuff for a few months. 
---
I'm aware of what it's for. Blizzard's decision to cater to retail tourism is why we have layering and servers with several times the amount of players they can support.
---
Everyone knows what retail WoW is. If they're not already subbed, putting Classic on the same sub isn't going to change shit. People who sub for Classic want Classic, not BfA.
---
Where did you get that information from? My understanding of layering is that each layer is like a server capacity. Hence the scaremongering of huge queues post removal.
---
I could be wrong but it makes a lot more sense to me.
---
Bloodvine set bonus requires tailoring.
---
The only people that are going to be convinced to move are the solo guys that are rolling there. You have groups like mine that are like 30 people scattered through multiple groups of people’s friend. I’m not about to try to campaign for all those people to now try to claim their names on the other server especially after it was stealth released mid day and you have tools out there reserving names to sell them.
---
As someone that works in IT, the capacity planning portion of their rollout has been entirely laughable and the community management portion of their team seems basically worthless at letting that team know what is going to happen.
---
And I’m just sitting here. Waiting until the last day to subscribe. Hoping all this sorts itself out before I pull the trigger
---
Even if it was a thing that would be like using an encyclopedia that never got updated. If they don't want new information, let them use their old out of date encyclopedia. And yes it will be out of date because people have learned things about that version of the game since.
---
Twitch didn't want to be directed to the addons folder but it looks like it's working now, I directed it to the classic umbrella folder \_classic\_
---
I'm not completely clued up, but I think they are known for controlling economies on private servers from all their farming etc
---
Blackrock is where the pvp endgame happens. I can´t imagine how streamer raids want to pass that area in phase 2. Same with Silithus later. You can get so much fame by fucking up their raids in front of thousands of viewers. This is the main reason why I regret not rolling on a streamer server. Everyone knows Trollgodx and he was just a tiny level 1 troll goofing around for two hours.
---
Dungeon my ass to 60. MT
---
Its not all the Brits,
---
Loads of us are on Golemagg.
---
It would probably be annoying with half a million people on one server tho.
---
The human in front should have been using a classic model.
---
Yikes you're a certified edge lord aren't you
---
Lets be honest. The biggest suprise here is that No Man's Sky is second.
---
ooh ok :) Ye priv servers tend to have boosted dynamic respawns
---
Yup or instead of gouge kidney shot and pwn pwn.
---

---
Awesome! I’m not at home so I couldn’t pull mine up. Glad it’s working!
---
What did he say?
---
Overwatch finally adds a 2/2/2 role q and I couldnt care less because classic is out in 9 days. You win either way bliz, just take my money and give me azeroth.
---
FFXIV is good, I'd be playing it if they fix god damn 2.X main story quest (which they are planning too). Heavensward is apparently amazing, Stormblood is pretty good, and Shadowbringer destroys them all.
---
If this is true I’m curious how many never accepted saw during the launch test cuz of layering
---
It was already crowded as hell in my layer
---
Herod stv gonna be some scurry shit in phase 2 when people are incentivized to go hunting for kills and no layering.*
---
Your dog has fantastic teeth considering he/she is 14 years old. 
---
Good job, seriously.
---
Hell yeah, chromie is great!
---
Same for me and my younger sister, she passed at 35 years old from cancer in 2015, so I know what you mean a bit. I'm very sorry for your loss and I hope you find comfort with the memories that WoW Classic brings. *hugs* RIP
---
I believe both classic+ and TBC people would settle with revamped TBC content excluding the common features e.g. outworld / flying mounts / pvp arenas etc. I still wish classic+ could be achieved by including the zones such as silvermoon and gilneas, but obviously without new playable races. Other things such as implementing Dalaran under the bubble as a neutral city wouldn't be a bad idea. Yeah, I know this sounds pretty horrible but I don't think it would be game breaking horrible and more in tune with what classic+ at least for me would mean.
---
I didn't see it mate, my fault. 🙄
---
Super Mario Maker 2
---
if you are min/maxing, almost no pvp or pve build is the same. Eggsecutie pretty much pointed out some of the top talents tho. but also riposte while not useful in anyway in raids, is amazing in pvp. endurance mixed with the sprint is huge for anti roots/snares. Mace spec, is mace spec enough said.
---
That dog has seen some shit
---
I mean, they were founded in 2016 so they've only been around for 3 years. Depending on what kind of game they are making it's not that strange.
---
Go mining while leveling
---
Well that'S good for the people who have done that 15 years ago. I've never played classic wow. I started playing wow when Wotlk was released so I don't know anything about classic mechanics, what to look out for, what to farm to make some coin etc.

Completely forgot about that. Not sure a profession is worth 2% Crit Chance though.

Over the past year, I have been telling myself it's cool but I don't think I am that bothered about vanilla.  
---
As we approach launch, and watching this - turns out, with the smiling creeping on my face ...
---
I fucking care.
---
Which server/faction?
---
Zandalar Tribe has some youtubers/streamers playing on it. That might be a game changer.
---
While kinda funny, that is a terrible representation of a rogue.
---
True. I'm not saying they should do it, but it's a big reason why I'd be more keen on a TBC release than vanilla.
---
Same design philosophy but plenty of QoL improvements and balance adjustments.
---
It does yup, it can play files from an AddOn's folder, you're right in that it would be a large AddOn though, hence "sound packs" being necessary. I've been playing WoW for 13 years, since I was 7, I know every single track in this game and I hum some of them often. I never listen to "real" music, i'm the kind of nerd that listens to WoW even when i'm not playing it. I won't get tired of Plains for months, but I already know I will get tired of it eventually from experience leveling a toon on a pserver a few years back. It's not a big deal, bit it is mildly annoying. I don't quite get why you're so opposed to other people enjoying music from the future with convenience?
---
nice, looking forward to watching it
---
Enough said what? I don't know much about Vanilla.
---
the amount of melee I remember getting off gaurd by disarming as a rogue with riposte is also huge. People will have to learn the value of weapon chains over regular dps enchants if they plan on pvping.
---
Lol ok buddy
---
lets take a moment to think about it
---
I'm 99% sure OP just took two random pics of golden retrievers

---
Cheers for the downvotes, if you ask for an opinion don't get pissed when someone posts their honest opinion based on the sad facts. Higher as results in lower HS hits, hence the statement.
---
Vanilla experience entails finding friends while playing. Or is it way too "hardcore" nowadays?
---
I mean, look at the (non) competition.
---
Bruv... recount is more than dead. IF details will work for classic definitely go for details. Best damage meter around.

---
 All of the laptops you linked will run classic fine depending on what settings you use. Personally I don't care about graphics, I actually think the game looks fine on 1 out of 10 graphic setting. 
---
 I ran the stress test on a 7,5 year old computer at 5 out of 10 graphic setting with max draw distance for objects. Had FPS capped at 60 and never dropped below that. Didn't try but possible I could have upped my settings some more.
---
 My computer is pretty solid despite being so old though, i7 CPU, 16 gig RAM, SSD harddrive but the graphic card is horrible by todays standard and lowers the overall performance massively.  GTX 560 ti with 1 gig RAM. 
---
 The specs for the laptops you linked are worse except for the GPU, GTX 1050. I wouldn't know how to judge the performance really but for sure you would be able to run the game. My guess would be 5 out of 10 graphics at the worst. But someone correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Seems like you really did your recon. It's just a big ask. A possibility would be to learn LUA and make it on your own. LUA is a very beginner friendly programming language.
---
DECIMATE THE WEAK
---
Lol If only I made Vampire Hunter D x WoW
---
yeah, I think the people that dont value combat in classic pvp are people that just duel. In BG's we can have insane burst with AR, but the utility you can get out of combat is huge.
---
Afaik didn't battlemasters originally appear only during weekends?
---
I just remember them taking sooooooo long. Like I had to do my Ony quest chain. Took SOOOOOOO long, like 4 hours in LBRS. that’s just too much. I don’t mind longer, but some of those got ridiculous.
---
Yeah, no. 
---
If a lot of us could make our way in WoW when we were 7-12 I’m sure we’ll be fine.
---
When you put it that way!
---
Thanka for the info, i'll be sure to check out the progress at launch tho
---
So i stand corrected: no rag week 1
---
Raiding paladins are only holy aka buff bots. They don't get fun till bc. Imo.
---
Before betas he believed classic wouldn't be popular and it was a futile effort, and after the beta he 180'd on his opinion

He will! Nothing bonds better than a good game with the old pops! Whether it be poker with my father growing up, or smash bros with my kids, these moments will be cherished until the end of time.

I think Reddit has a tendency to think it's an average of demographics but it's not. Any guess now, especially as high as 80%, is bollocks.
---
It was great for hunters to be eng and use feign death to get out of combat then Rez a healer with the jumper cables. Felt like such a hero doing that.
---
Thoughts?
---
This is so true. People seem to think that you need a constant 10k+ concurrent players on a realm for it to be "alive". Somewhere around 3-5k as you said is a healthy number.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
&gt;With a separate sub, layering would not have been necessary
---
You mean with a lower population in a server, layering would not have been necessary. Can you explain how less people playing the game is a good thing?
---
&gt;People who sub for Classic want Classic, not BfA.
---
How can you possibly know this? How can't you see how hard you're projecting right now?
---
Great video!
---
Yea, some keyboard warriors can be pretty toxic and timing can mean everything if you don't have followers.

You think youre going to just log into your blizz account and resub on the 27th? I'd do it a couple days ahead of time. guarantee their site is going to implode on launch day.
---
Ok this goofy shit made me LOL pretty good.
---
Blizzard are being cautious, players are being stubborn.
---
Because I plan to play for years and don't want the name sstiobgewkpov on my main.
---
They were later added as a core npc in the mayor cities and if they base code on 1.12 then we will have 24/7 access to battlemasters there
---
If they do, justice for Dunkan, once they hit 60 he'll form a guild the mage will apply to and he'll remember. OH HE'LL REMEMBER.
---
I don't think so. I think a lot of you are having a hard time understanding  that it's better to have a handful of full servers than a couple handfuls of low pop servers.   I was around in vanilla and such when server merges happened and how big of a pain I. The ass it was for everyone involved.  Trust me blizzard knows what it's doing they know from experience that it's better for the long term health of the game to run as few servers as possible from both cost and player perspectives. Believe me that as a player a full server is a much prefered  problem than an empty server.
---
It matters for the client side, hence layering. Rendering and data for 80,000 people in ironforge just wouldn’t work
---
I loved this game, I spent most of my time at an internet cafe just playing this like a lil sado lool
---
Check your local Facebook Market Place &amp; Craigslist. There are a lot of people who bought gaming PCs, presumably to be like Ninja, and realized they don't care for it after all. 
---
They usually want to just recoup some cost and let really decent systems go for a bargain.
---
Well my friends will get tired of the game i'm pretty sure, but I intend to go a bit hardcore in the first two weeks and i'm looking forward to make some new friends ingame. I'm on Shazzrah (might change to Gehennas/Zandalar or a new server that pops) and I play alliance.
---
Did you read the post? They will open another when the 3rd realm gets full.
---
I think hemeans battlemasters that you could join battlegrounds and teleport to them from capital cities. I don't think they were in vanilla.
---
I'd like to share one of my secrets.
---
There's a really good grinding spot in Feralas, North West of Mojache. It's a Grimtotem camp but if you look hard enough there's a hidden path near a totem that goes up and there's a hidden village that's rarely used there. Plenty of mobs and chests and by the time you kill them all they're respawning again.
---
Well, if they are all going horde that might kinda be a problem.
---
Blizzard has done everything right.
---
I think dungeon finder would have been fine if they didn't make it teleport you to the dungeon. Have it form the group then have everyone run to the dungeon.
---
No queues happen because of a throughput problem. In theory you can optimize this.
---
What do you mean by capital cities campaign?
---
I kind of hope you're right. I'd love my guild to move early.
---
This is a general rule, not a universal rule, it's like a stereotype. Also, streamer bad has more to do with gameplay impact than the actual streaming itself.
---
What a witty retort
---
Mace spec is 5% chance on melee hit to stun for like 1-3 seconds, cant remember and to lazy to look up. Also, because it is random the way they used to handle it, I dont think it counts as DR vs regular stuns.
---
I think Blizzard knows exactly what they are doing
---
Because generally people have a lot to do on the weekends. They're going out, they're taking weekend trips, they're kids are playing sports, they have family visit. 
---
During the week you have a routine that's pretty much work/school, food, downtime, sleep. Most people are home in that downtime and available to raid.
---
How would you know? It’s not like the reports from their QA vendors are released to the public.
---
&gt;after the beta
---
during the beta.  The beginning of the beta actually.  He released a video while he was leveling in Silverpine about how much he was enjoying the game.  Talking about the things he found so amazing in classic compared to BFA.  It was funny because he was talking about how great the interactions with other players had been and somebody walked by and he buffed them and the guy came over and said thanks.  Pretty good stuff.
---
I don't even play retail homeslice
---
i'm a grown man and this brought a tear to my eye, we coming home guys
---
Nice!! I'm not sure why the comments are so toxic here or why so many people here hate tattoos in this day and age. I guess you really would be better off putting this in r/wow.
---
And the people pointing out that Sylvanas is only a reskinned night elf in Classic, like, so we expect people to get tattoos of her as a night elf? Really?
---
That's strong, less burst though I guess.
---
My point with morals was, that you‘re ruining somebodys playtime because they literally can‘t do anything about the gank. They can‘t fight back.
---
Eh I'd say it's a little bit of both. I don't think the devs themselves are unaware of what people want, but they aren't the ones who make decisions either.
---
&gt;stop mindlessly slamming their community
---
Ethnocentrism isn't something you can just wish away.
---
I plan on doing the same thing but on a warlock. You won't sustain engineering while levelling so don't worry about it till 60. You will however need some leather for random tailor recipes and skinning is the easiest gathering profession to sustain levelling. Play tailor / skinning and later drop skinning for engineering. Mining will be hard to level efficiently with and won't be worth trying to keep at the same level you are.
---
Oh boy here we go again. Gold sellers and level boosters will come back big time. Don‘t use them. Just don‘t
---
Why not just fill up the RP-PvP server first?
---
The servers will be grey. And will light um once you can play like every expac
---
because it got major new update.
---
Giving it more power will upset pvp balance. people will cry.
---
People have social lives on the weekend
---
he meant well but but it came across as condenscending ..right? I hope im right
---
I see someone posted the YouTube link. Watch it when you have some time!
---
Yes it's the case but the perception of Paladin has changed from vanilla times to pserver/classic times we're at now.
---
You could play a paladin and have a happy life tanking all dungeons until 60 if you wanted to do that, there was a famous player named WoWHobbs who made his living/reputation powerleveling people thru dungeons. They can't tank raids.
---
Retribution sucks in pve but if you can get gear for them they can be very strong in pvp, especially small skirmishes.
---
Holy is simply the best heals in the game, if you enjoy that, you'll enjoy it, especially in pvp they can turn a warrior into a literal raid boss.
---
Both German servers are full. We need at least another PVP Server as Lucifron was full basically immediately.
---
I can tell you with 100% certainty that 99,99% of the playerbase was never this prepared. I was definitely not. I only had the bare minimum so the raid leader wouldn't bark at me.
---
This is great and all, but it's still just all hype. I hope it does well, but we'll see what happens in 3 months.
---
Me not that kinda orc
---
What happens if you lose vs Vietnam
---
all of them are overkill really
---
Agreed. This is why I don’t understand all of the bitching about layering. 
---
People are falsely equating layering with having completely empty zones. That’s definitely not going to be the case. The entire rationale behind layering was so Blizzard could provide a huge influx of players with zones that have a healthy population of other players.
---
thex
---
While I agree with your overall comment can you explain the difference between these two: 
---
&gt; Queue times aren't based on population cap.
---
&gt; Queue times are based on concurrent play session caps.
---
Wouldn't the population cap always = concurrent play session caps?
---
Yea I did try a few months ago to get into LUA, I suppose I could try again, only 9 days until Classic launches though. I should of tried again sooner
---
While that’s true, it would be nice for more of these items to make it to the AH especially for extremely rare blue boes.  It damn near a tragedy for someone who’s just leveling to equip a Pendulum of Doom, or for a pair of Spellshock Leggings.
---
There will be no merges. If blizzard offers server transfer, you need to change name if someone has your name on the server you transfer to
---
If you get to be the paladin that judges seal of light you should have the #1 healing output (doesn't change the gameplay much though). Especially with some gear holy pala gets very strong. You'll never have issues finding raid spots. If you can get past the fact that you're almost exclusively using flash of light there are quite some upsides to playing paladin. Unkillable in pvp, always wanted for raids, fancy ass horse and very big dick looking t2 set. And who knows, if they take the game further after p5 pala will only get stronger and you'll already have an endgame pala to play.
---
Also: Just because you're mostly using the same spell doesn't mean there's no skill in playing holy pala. The skill ceiling for healing remains the highest compared to other classes.
---
Ah see I gave the stress test a shot because I figured what the hell and it clicked with me and I remember how amazing the game is so I'm relearning leveling areas and figuring out which class I want to commit to so I don't waste time once I do start playing with like 4 different characters all level 10 lol plus its honestly just fun and I've already found a classic guild I mesh well with
---
Ret pal bc I want to feel the hate from everyone
---
Depends how min/max you really are. Other professions could provide means of making money. Not everyone has enough time to create alts to farm in order to supplement their in game economy.
---
Damn, I wish human females were real
---
Thanks buddy :) means a lot
---
for pvp gnome rogue are the most annoying.
---
For pve, you're going to hate leveling a rogue, the progress is super slow.
---
Instant upvote when seeing the thumbnail
---
Yea, I'm a programmer and I don't feel like learning LUA.
---
Casually playing takes 20 years for 99 rc
---
Because i want to play PvP a lot when AV rolls out. Frost is superior in pvp but im not so sure about PvE in that time.
---
The ranking ls change with tiers...
---
The wording is a bit strange though. Probably just a third party service
---
Ya'll motherfuckers have been to the wrong midsommar parties, I'll tell you that right now.
---
Thanks to /u/Clowncopter, /u/idlelowbie, /u/Asdioh, /u/tykha, and /u/Dontusethisname1 for helping me refine the meme. Your feedback was appreciated!
---
Updoot for "tacticool"   Gonna add that to my list of words I like, but will probably never remember.
---
Yes and Shazzrah has gotten the warning about being mega crowded with extreme queues.
---
But you have to remember that we're still over a week away with most likely a majority of the players that will play Classic on release not even having done the name reservation yet or might not even do it before release day.
---
What is his name?
---
How did they fuck up? They can't control the Reddit hivemind. It's ya'lls fault you all decided to jump on one single server.  Did none of you actually think this through when you were in here telling the entire community to join this one server cause all the others are ruined by streamers and non English speakers etc? This is a community driven problem it would not have mattered if they had 50 servers if all you knuckle heads still decided to join the same server.
---
Its literally in the title of the stream. "We're rolling on Gehennas EU PVP"...
---
Nice
---
You're excused.
---
You forget that many people spread the names across multiple realms as they haven't decided yet. Not all the info will be accurate until everyone is playing.
---
Love the purpose and the artistic execution! Can't wait to see all of them!
---
This is 2004 all over again, people had \~24 hour queue times back then and we very well may have them again.  This is going to be great getting back to the original pre-TBC era.
---
Grab the first one.
---
Don’t think it’s ever gonna merge. If anything it will be as back then. You pay to switch server. But that it why there are few servers in the first place and the layering in the first phase.
---
Make sure you are a current sub.
---
Make sure you have the classic client downloaded and available in the "play" drop menu.
---
From there it should prompt you to choose a server after you fire up the launcher.
---
It's made by Sleepa__ check his YouTube https://youtu.be/q5o8_bvthkw
---
All we can do now is grind our one-handed skill.
---
If there's something that can kill Classic is this #nochanges attitude.
---
Nothing. All you should have to do is select wow classic from.the dropdown menu above the play button and login like normal
---
Yeah it is ofc, chinease farmers, by expected i meant 3rd parties creating gold selling and boosting services before launch, we'll probably get more ads after release, i just hope they get dealt with quickly ingame
---
OP must’ve either done his testing in a dead server of never tested these at all(most likely)
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxzhbZcZxidscMzVo
---
I’m going with this.
---
Oh nice you got a Pac-Man tattoo
---
Because they read feedback from this subreddit and uptades the game according to feedback.
---
It was and is a part of the vanilla experience that I wish everyone who missed it to experience.
---
Every class (except maybe druid) is going to be overpopulated. But I've noticed on a lot of survays they're usually middle of the pack in terms of popularity. 
---
The major down side is if you plan on going swords you're going to be fighting with warriors for some weapons (BIS or not, a fury warrior with trash weapons is rolling on any 1H that's an upgrade) and they can use some leather gear for pre raid. 
---
Personally, I wouldn't worry too much about a class being over populated.
---
It's made by Sleepa check out his YouTube https://youtu.be/q5o8_bvthkw
---
Yeah, I'm waiting to see how launch day is then I will sub then, if it is shit then I'll wait.
---
Voidwalker tanking is a private server thing only. He can't hold threat on live.
---
I had a dream last night I was playing my mage and I heard a rogue stealth....terrifying
---
We we're all Dunkan at one stage.
---
Keep him in there, mage starts to use polymorph which makes the entire run much smoother.
---
Barb drops, you click need faster than you've ever clicked anything ... your heart is going to explode as you wait for Dunkan to pass, you inspect him, he is using a white wooden club. It is a massive upgrade to him, imagine what it would do for his threat generation.
---
But he passes. he says Grats, then asks the most classic question ever...
---
/p Again?
---
Don't take this the wrong way, but if you aren't sure where you will be in PVE when AV comes out, it means that Frost will still be the optimal spec for you in both PVP &amp; PVE. That being said, Fire is completely viable in PVP. Sure, it's more of a glass cannon build, but given the support from others, you can nuke some shit.
---
Also, by AV times, I would imagine that you will have enough gold to afford a respec or two each week.
---
Quite astounding
---
on pservers it was popular to get the whole raid buffed in lbrs before going to mc... some mobs in there can be mced to provide fire resistance for 1h... so that's another reason why you can see 40 man raids going back and forth through the BRM
---
It's fine for the other classes as well, just put on int/+heal gear, no need to respec.
---
I stopped at beginning wotlk, so all add-ons in reverse are my favorit part 😂
---
Ask the Vietnamese.
---
But you don't see dragons turn into goblins do you?
---
So far blizzard took nostalrius and rp pvp petitions seriously and acted. A Reddit thread is not the place to make a petition tho.
---
10,000 person queue during the stress test only took me about 10 minutes, it really wasn't that bad.
---
Players on the "dying" server who share names with players on the "surviving" server are prompted to change their name. Same for guilds. Thats how it used to work, anyway.
---
PSA for anyone who wants to do this on classic: you can't heal the npcs in real vanilla that's a private server meme.
---
You can easy tank dungeons with arms/fury specc until lvl 50/55
---
Any decent druid.
---
Yeah that totally wouldn't be abused
---
Yes, they are being taught by a traitor gnome in booty bay.
---
No you wont.
---
You will be lost forever.
---
RiP Prixm
---
Think he is being the pack mule, I'm 99,99% sure that the green flasks are distilled wisdom (2k mana) and the yellow is Titan's (1.2k HP), which would be for the tanks and healers (or warlock tanks on twins?).
---
Most of that shit was probably traded around to the rest of the raid haha.
---
If you want a class that can kind of do all three roles, your options are druid, Paladin, or shaman. 
---
I never played any of these three in vanilla, but I know that they will never be warriors, priests, or rogues. 
---
Keep in mind that respecing is expensive, so if you want to do two roles with one hybrid spec you might end up gimping yourself. 
---
Paladins can run a prot/holy build, but you miss out on some key holy talents that will gimp your healing, and at the end of the day prot pally is only really viable in 5/10 man's and I've read that it has a high skill cap to not oom and maintain threat. 
---
Druids might be able to have a pretty good build for bear + cat, with some off healing utilities. Druids are also beasts (see what I did there?) In WSG as ideal flag carriers. They are my pick if you want to dip into multiple roles in all aspects of the game. Added bonus- don't have to worry about crappy gear looking like a clown. 
---
No clue about shamans. The tanking aspect of enhance might just be a meme. DPS shamans, like all of these classes, are more hybrid and support rather than pure DPS. You'll spend a lot of time learning to manage totems for your rogues/warriors.
---
For leveling, bow spec plus beast slaying is pretty helpful.
---
Im gonna have to measure that but I think those would  be really big hands that can reach there without repositioning. Might be a 1%er
---
Using the PvP spec is a good way to go, it allows you to tank well enough. Don't need Prot pre-60 really :)
---
They were very clear in stating that they are using the 1.12 patch as a baseline and only gate content related items/NPCs. So in 1.12, the Battle master's were in the main cities, that's what Classic should be.
---
NO CHANGES
---
You can tank all 5 mans without prot spec. Especially any dungeons before endgame.
---
You don’t need to be prot to tank dungeons while leveling So it’s not a issue just put on a shield and def stance
---
This is going straight into my cringe folder
---
The 2 I remember were The Knights who Say Ni which was smaller, then I joined my friends guild Council of Nine, which I hear is still going lol.
---
Perhaps, but making an issue known to the general public is often a great start.
---
The bonus is only useful for Phases 1-2.
---
Starting with BWL in Phase 3, you'll use crossbows for the rest of the game. So you won't benefit from your racial bonus anymore.
---
Also, +hit is quite easy to get on Hunters. You can get 3% from talents and another 2% from a scope. You don't need that much hit either since your attacks can't be glanced.
---
Barrens.chat and classicwow.live
---
This subreddit has gotten to the point of everyone killing time until launch and going crazy with anticipation. Should return to more quality content after launch
---
Truly legendary!
---
I'm gonna tank with a 2 handed weapon in DPS spec in battle stance and blame the healer if i die.
---
I kinda want to roll a rogue just to bring more terror to what will be a very crowded STV. You gotta earn level 40 in classic.
---
No way, sir.
---
NoT tHe AcTuAL LAunCH eXPeRiEnCe!!!
---
which is it, do you love your friends more or do you love you more.  I know you will make the right choice.
---
Doing the same with my brother. He was 9 back then when we cleared naxxramas. Now I can take him with me on my journey.
---
Yes. Layering isn't infinite. Take a 3k pop server. Give it say 5 layers. That's only 15k people. meanwhile there is probably 20k+ signed up for herod.
---
Is his FAQ out of date?
---
&gt;Q: Will Joana speedrun on !Classic launch?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;A: Yes! I will be speed leveling for Classic WoW launch and beyond. I have been full time on Vanilla/Classic WoW (since January of 2018) and im certain I will beat my 4day 20hour time. Auto looting alone will save 5+ hours. There is much faster routes than what was used in the 420 run. I am also more skilled at the game. Classic launch is going to be amazing!
---
Thank you, this is exactly what I wanted to know!!
---
Guys come on. We think we want this. But we don’t.. 
---
remember?
---
No idea mate.
---
Bought these during the original releases, kept them around depite not being relevant anymore. I read the one for vanilla front to back multiple times back in the day. Lets see how well it will hold up with the re-release of vanilla :)
---
You’re not supposed to wear pants when you play WoW. Ya done goofed!
---
Totally stuck in my head now...
---
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
---
/cry
---
Yeah correct, once layering is removed server caps will be that of vanilla so these servers with 20k people are just fucked with queue times
---
You can transfer for free right now.
---
I actually made this

[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bidu4u/hunter\_weapons/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bidu4u/hunter_weapons/)  
---
Also three months ago. I'm just very flattered people are liking my videos and reposts actually really helps my youtube channel grow. I was indeed heavily inspired by the gif and thanked the creator for the inspiration.
---
Exactly, I'm not trying to change how the battlemasters work in any way, the only thing is to postpone to battlemasters to perhaps phase 4 instead of phase 3.
---
If you have no requirements that'd narrow down your choices, you may as well go watch class overviews on youtube. There's hours of them, it'd take too long to reiterate even a condensed summary. One thing that comes to mind is to settle on professions you'll be using on your first char and take something that'd benefit from those (and don't take engineering or enhanting on the first char since those are money hogs). The other is that being able to tank or heal a 5-man would make finding a party for one 50% easier. Other than that, just pick whatever sounds cool to you.
---
releasing puts you at the start of the dungeon in retail currently. There's no running through a zone to get back in at all.
---
I think 4 hours is a little bit too much :) Blizzard login servers can do better than that. Everyone will get layered, server cap will be much higher than on private servers and there's gonna be multiple servers instead of 1 after all.
---
Sure, you don't need a PhD to accomplish a hunter rotation, but it's one of the most complicated of the meta dps classes. Especially compared to one button rotations like mage / warlock.
---
Yo are you 12
---
Not really, only a 1s interval between ticks.
---
What's the betting your sugar crash hits before you get past the login queue?
---
Will be rolling druid and 100% following the druid code as it was.
---
Me
---
The gnome racial is also very strong in PvP.
---
I have see jn this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU6PAnGUKV0)  that the guys does a run for area exploration to level 5 in 50min /played time.
---
I have tested this route during the stress test and it is legit, so if the starting areas are too cluttered and you are fighting to get mobs maybe this is an option.
---
It is very specific from to Alliance but I guess the Horde can achieve the same thing.
---
🤔🤔🤔
---
New big update that made quite a lot of changes including some good QOL improvements.
---
I have been playing since closed beta 2012 lol. I know poe used to be slow paced but slow paced doesn't mean hard. Maps didnt used to be hard, they just didnt drop which is why people didnt get to high lvl maps.
---
Yeah his Twitter is pretty bad sometimes. I do enjoy the gems like the OP though.
---
Many have not played one done right. They won’t understand until they try it.
---
I mean you still have 10 days, wouldn't it be better to prepare some lasagna or burritos or something that freezes well instead of eating the worst kind of frozen pizza, ramen and macaroni with dressing?
---
Yes, we will see. Plan is for the layering to scale up to accommodate the initial surge. However each realm will still have an upper limit. I would expect that even with layering they would try and undershoot the total number of realms. They can always add new realms, split realms, and offer free character xfers to deal with over-full realms.
---
From a marketing perspective it looks better to handle overflowing realms instead of having some realms DOA.
---
Paladin: arrives cleanse - freedom - mounts job done
---
Youre gonna be walking back to your irl corpse a lot after release...but nonetheless have fun!
---
If you can handle it, join the discords for the servers your interested in, I've been looking and they all seem to have guild recruitment sections, the majority of guilds have their raid times posted there. 
---
Just beware, especially for the pvp servers, the discords general channels are hard to look at.
---
I got divorced last year (her choice, said she just fell out of love), I quit WoW when I met her which was easy to do because I was super casual , had been for three expansions, and it was Cata which sucked anyway.  If I was still married I wouldn’t even be thinking about coming back for classic. It would be eating me up, but I don’t think I would do it.
---
Divorce sucks and when it’s the result of the capricious nature of feelings changing, it can give one trust issues.  I doubt I’ll trust enough again to tie myself legally to another.  No kids so at least it was a clean break.
---
I didn’t actually find out about the WoW classic announcement until after my separation so that was very timely and quite the pick me up.
---
The average dungeon meta is looking at 4-4.5d played to 60.
---
I expect when the meta gets sorted out and maybe with warlock summons and 20-30 support players they could do 3.5d played to 60.
---
Also it doesn't take 36 hrs to farm rep and gear.
---
They'll be doing rep grinds by resetting trash and doing actual Mc in leveling blues and greens.
---
I think week 1 rag is totally doable.
---
Stalagg! Well populated but smaller than Herod

Never heard of them until now.  Does “APE” stand for something?

I'm sorry that you live such a sad life
---
playing devil's advocate here: isn't it a bad idea to have servers have a bigger capacity? The big community-sellingpoint was that you build your reputation. How would this be possible like it used to be when meny more players are around. It's like living in a village where everyone knows each other vs. living in a city where you avoid other people.

?!

I have watched a few of his videos and he is absolutely not my cup of tea. He looks like the Sandy Hook school shooter and it seems like a huge number of his videos are “reaction” videos to him watching someone else’s original content like Punkrat’s guides. Fuck this autist.

While *what* waits for people?

Oh, I like this one.

Hope someone has it.

Stand in the fire for maximum DPS.
---
I'd actually been considering enhancement shaman but I have no idea how they performed. I only picked them because ever since the Legion class hall where they basically get Mjolnir I've LOVED Enhance, and wished it was viable in retail so I could actually play it.
---
I'm willing to bet Blizzard is counting on many people dropping classic before the end of layering. I just wonder what the plan is if it is time for Phase 2(alleged end of layering) and servers are still way past full.
---
Rouge:cheap shots pala
---
I understand what you are proposing, but Battle Master's are a part of the BG system, they were in Capital Cities in 1.12, which means they are going to be in Capital Cities when BGs are releases.

I’m on Grobbulus.  I don’t anticipate a long queue time.

is hunter the fastest gold farming class in phase 1?
---
That would be crazy! Like...I suppose you could make a mod that cross referenced an npc database so it would know if those existed, but I don't think there's any inherent meta data about tracking pips that you could access through lua. And what about false positives for people named like Squirrel. I would love a targeting computer addon like that but I think the overhead would just be tremendous.
---
He's literally playing the class people make as a farming alt.
---
Stalagg is just the better option, it's got GG in it's name.
---
why are some of you people here so thick sculled?  
---
Do you not understand that it was different time back then and WoW had almost 0 proper competition?   
---
While today there are hundreds of F2P games to take your attention, no need to pay monthly for one.

Back then, there were almost none and most were garbage.

Subs over game's lifespan are not simply based on game's quality.

Subjective opinion!

My subjective opinion is that a large number of these tourists (including a fair number who are only turning up to troll classic fans) will be hooked.

They might think they don't want it, but they do...

---
The thing with resto druids are that only one druid can apply their healing dots on a target. Which means only the best geared druid puts up dots while the others get to spam down ranked healing touch. This also means that all the gear will go to the druid that puts up the dots first.
---
They also don't have a ress which is a bummer in dungeons. But sure, they're pretty fun and you should absolutely roll one if you want to.
---
You want to sit in a 10k queue or not? I'd avoid all servers that's full.
---
That's why I didn't play during any of the stress tests. Would've just made it worse for me tbh
---
Perfectly timed Shield Bash.
---
some of it the guy got paid by private servers to make but most of it was just projects he gave himself. You should check out his naxx one it's amazing
---
How in this day and age you have servers that can’t handle more people? We are talking Activision Blizzard. They can afford the best servers.

Is the joke that this is just totally unreadable?

You must really like long BG queues

I’ve seen a lot of Hurricane’s videos and they’re all fantastic! I love the Ahn’Qiraj and Naxxramas ones especially.
---
I do not misunderstand a thing...... and I play on Pvp servers since Illidan server existed. Just because I enjoy them does not mean what I said above is not true. 
---
I enjoy the extra challenge and make my own content by pvping when I wish, but having played actual PvP games where the entire world is a real battlefield and PvP actually matters, I am fully aware that “make your own content” is a bullshit model. 
---
I also have no issues explaining how pointless and broken the class balance is on said PvP servers, especially for people who are only rolling there because of artificially created hype. 
---
Always remember people on the internet lie, most of the people on this reddit are sad sacks who never played vanilla retail seriously or at all, and the PvP experiences between retail and the 3-5x larger omega private servers are Worlds different.
---
So you're playing a troll, I see. For the horde
---
Yes. There is a cap on the number of layers, Blizzard explained this already. So say there are a maximum of 10 layers with 3k player cap per layer. If 40k people tried to play, Blizzard wouldn't add 3-4 layers, but instead there would be a 10k queue.
---
League is and will stay bigger always. just wait for the one year hype to die if they dont update classic.

You have been waiting for this moment haven’t you? :)
---
high quality shitpost , i rate it 9/9 .
---
Layer numbers are not limitless. Technically Blizzard could add any number of layers to a server but they won't. So if a server is grossly overpopulated, yes, there will be queues on release.
---
Vanilla realms had a ~3K concurrently online player limit. In Classic layers have this limit. When layering ends, only one "layer" remains, with the aforementioned cap. So if a server is grossly overpopulated even when layering ends, expect *monstrous* queues.
---
There is no complete package called BG system, if there was then we would be getting arathi basin at the same time as wsg and that is not the case.
---
Add battlemasters together with AB release and everything is fine and dandy.
---
So no changes is against Vanilla WoW now?
---
Germany vs. Russia in a snowy environment like AV.... that never ended well for the German team...
---
Against the French however, historically - there is more of a balance...
---
Seriously, thinking about it this way, putting teams from different nations against each other might not be such a good idea...
---
I think I just came in my pants
---
Oh man those sound familiar!  I was in MGX then Crimson.
---
That is not at all what would happen. If anything classic just shows there is demand for a more traditional mmo and Blizz will try to bake a bunch of that into the next expansion. 
---
Also, I think it's EXTREMELY unlikely that Classic will outpreform retail in revenue. Not only does the sub pay for both but retail makes most of it's money from in-game-services and microtransactions.
---
It also has lag in it's name...
---
Basicly they want your b.rez and innervate.  Until Phase 2-3 you’re not a very optimal healer. They are needed but in very small amount because they bring very specific key spells.  If you have good raid attendance everyone will want you.
---
Don’t worry about a raid spot,  everyone needs good druids ( even feral ) you still bring both brez and inervate. Also with healing gear you can still do an average job at healing for fights where more healing is required.
---
Learned something new, did not know that. My mistake.
---
Just level both. The items require specialization to make, not use.
---
They updated the models. They're available in BfA. Go have fun.
---
Population cap is the total number of accounts with characters created on that realm.
---
Concurrency cap is the total number of players with *current sessions* on that realm.
---
The former only matters insomuch as you can usually predict the latter using only the former.
---
They are very different numbers in terms of size, though.
---
They are managing for concurrency once layering is removed by capping population.
---
98 is halfway in d2
---
Very well said.
---
You’re gonna love it, it’s incredible. Especially if you have even a slight excitement for it, it will be matched. Playing with a S/O is even better
---
Even better. The classic experience.
---
My guild officers flat out said that all of them(other than thinderfury on MT) are blocked from getting legendaries. Good son they are taking it seriously.
---
Leveling is what I love about MMOs. I don’t wanna rush it to the top levels so I can finally experience the game, I wanna enjoy every aspect of it as I level. That’s what WoW was when it first released. Every new zone was a new experience. I quit after a while and came back and immediately felt like everyone was rushing me to the top levels. I also felt like I leveled too fast. I made it to Scarlet Monastery and still had low level equipment. Just wasn’t the same.
---
It's honestly so much fun watching people discover the Classic Magic.
---
I think my favorite instance has got to be Preach during the first beta. Prior to the Beta he was pretty clear that he had no intention of going back to classic long term. Preach wasn't a dick about it, he was really happy for the people who were excited for classic, but he insisted that it simply wasn't for him and didn't interest him.
---
Now, he still gave Classic WoW a go for nostalgia's sake during the first beta. He released a video of his first couple runs through Rage Fire Chasm and you can literally see the excitement start to form. You can watch him remember why he loved Classic. You can watch him see how much more fun he's having in that low level 5 man dungeon than he does in most 15+ Mythic Plus Keys. And that's honestly what convinced me that I'll be all in for Classic when the time comes. That's when I realized it's more than just nostalgia. Classic has something that modern games are missing and I just can't wait.
---
It's gonna be a good time man.
---
I’ll be grobbin it by the....
---
That's exactly why layering is being used: that incoming population drop.
---
They've said they plan to allow free transfers off of the overpopulated servers if not enough people leave them like they've done in the past.
---
Personally I don’t invite them as healer unless we have a Rez alrdy in our group. This only applies to dungeons.
---
Mage was dead already
---
May i ask why? I just bought a 27 inch 1080p display to replace one that didnt had VESA and was very surprised by the prices nowadays.

Its an BenQ with IPS-Panel and cost me 90 CHF or roughly 88 Euros. (new, out of the store)

Only gnomes and dwarves, I don't think that changes till WotLK.
---
Only thing I'm gonna miss in classic is the current combat system. 
---
Spamming frost or fire bolts with cast times of 2.5 to 3.0 seconds as your primary rotation is torture.
---
Well, you don't have as much experience with Blizzard's work with WoW then, specifically recent work.  If you did, you'd be worried.  That being said, I suppose it's good to be optimistic and we are all excited for Classic, even if a bit frustrated about some things.
---
If your on Herod, 4 hours could be a reality.  Read there Blue post about Herod.  It pretty much says they arent budging on the situation. So be prepared for it.   That goes for Faerlina and Whitemane servers too. Just to a lesser extent.
---
What a world we live in.  "World of Warcraft influencer"

Congrats for planning and successfully going through with this stupid post. Legitimately higher effort than most other content here lol

Touché.
---
You are not PREPARED!
---
Noooooo dude we are old enough now to prepare health food to actually keep us focused. You're gonna have so many sugar crashes making you tired and log off

it will feel like an expansion because blizzard deleted a lot of stuff from the game in the last few expansions LUL

Also has Sta in it's name, which stands for STAAAANNN *bad randy marsh impression*
---
I bought gold from China in classic, I need to buy it again to get the crisp vanilla experience.
---
I go for old school b/w tattoos but I really love the look of this one, if anything it’s done amazingly well and looks sharp. Tattoos are very subjective and r/classic can be toxic, dont let it bring you down!

It took me way too long to get this.

This low fibre diet is going to give you a serious constipation. What about getting som over the counter laxatives? Or you plan to become constipated so you don't spend time pooping?

Keep in mind that the game needs to support it. In STO you can export the model to Game Print via the ship customization screen.
---
? you don't know shit. back in the day when we had no phasing or crossrealms, some servers had even more than 10k players on both sides.
---
For a while, there will be serious people in classic. But before long all these dumbasses who are so used to getting everything handed to them and whining when they dont, will leave classic and head back to whence they came.
---
Many I have talked to think that they will enjoy Vanilla, but I have played with them and they whine when the AH doesn't have what they need. They are in for a shock. And it will cause many to bolt for an easier game.
---
He talks about Warcraft 4. Is he mistakenly calls W3 Reforged a W4, or does he for real believe in Warcraft 4?
---
Does GuideLime come with leveling paths already loaded? Or do I have to find a guide to load in it?  If I need a guide does anyone have links?
---
I played SP in classic and the pvp was good (though I wasn’t great at pvp personally). Raid and even dungeon groups were almost nonexistent. You will not out dps the pure dps classes and have lowest priority on gear. If you enjoy warrior, I’d say go with that, they could be beasts in pvp too. 
---
Personally, I am switching up roles this time and just going mage since I don’t want to heal

As a recovering shadow priest, TBC was my jam. The variety in loot  and locations was great and specs that really sucked in vanilla got their time to shine. But it was also fairly unbalanced, which I suppose is fine. French vanilla if you will. Wrath is where I started to peter out really. The loot was all some color variation of that norse wood and metal motif that got REAL dull after a while.
---
I would be happy to play through TBC again eventually once vanilla has run its course. 20th anniversary maybe.
---
Thank you!!
---
Lvl as fury to 40 then go arms. Tank as arms with 1h shield and profit ;p
---
I really hope so, I was just picking a bit of fun at the recent blue post regarding the high pop servers :)
---
No changes is against lfr and group finder for pve encounters, why remove them but keeping the same thing for pvp encounters? 
---
Run to the instance if you want to run a dungeon and run to the instance if you want to run a pvp instance.
---
At least keep phase 3 pure, add battlemasters in phase 4 perhaps.
---
What is the horde/alliance split on EU going to be.  I still can't decide which I want to play.
---
and i thought we are all apes. how wrong can one be?
---
That subreddit is notoriously negative about everything so take no offense.
---
Your weapon type isn't that important while leveling. It's usually better to always go with the highest damage weapon you can get at the time.
---
30-40 is okay for me, because you have your mount to look forward to. 40-50 i always found the longest.
---
Ah ok, cool to know!
---
thanks
---
BRD, UBRS, LBRS, Scholo, Strat, all those runs makes going to 60 a lot faster
---
According to this post Herod at 30% would be orders of magnitude more populated then any vanilla server was
---
Edit: lost in action.
---
I don't think they'll keep layering longer, it'll have tons of backlash. Instead, I expect free transfers to the low - med pop realms.
---
This is vanilla, it should take under two months for regular people to hit 60
---
Lame flex
---
But if he would only sing it in the proper octave...

It was good therapy for me with all the other guys in the same boat.
---
What
---
When BGs came out, it was WSG/AV. In 1.12 you could queue for WSG/AV, regardless of AB being in existence or not.
---
Think of it like items. Items will only be available in their appropriate phase, but they will be released in their final form. The final form of WSG/AV has the ability to queue from a Battle Master in a capital city.
---
I thought the game was getting a classic summer release.
---
This is exactly why I'm leveling as sub. I can dab on the tryhard combat rogues in STV.
---
I got Murlocmender for my healer 5 days after herod opened.  People just need to be creative.
---
Well, if you start out in SwordWind, the  you’re probably one of the United Nations, so going up to Undertale is not only going to be a long trip, but the guards will try to kill you anyway. No, the Gobyear Blimp is definitely worse than taking a boat to Threadymoor, if you’re just trying to get to DustyTar.
---
How would a Hoard kid end up in Elladan Forest anyway?
---
Like 90% of the pvp is getting ganked by 3 people or when you are 10% hp killing a mob. The last 10% of the fights are actually fun
---
That will work if you don't mind painting and also a lot of clean up since most printers are FDM. DLP resin printers are becoming affordable and now coming to the market however, so this will offer far better quality for miniature/figurine prints.
---
And it shouldn't be that expensive anymore if you go by what Game Print is able to do. You can get a 4" model printed in color for like $25 for STO.
---
Why did rogues get a \~ in every spec for leveling while ret paladin got a turd in leveling and raiding? These posts are either guesswork or just biased.
---
Im interested in that Poke Mongo game but I can’t find any info on it.   Anyone know what the deal is?
---
Playing with AAP might ruin ***your*** experience, but for some the game starts at 60.
---
That's why dark souls is unpopular right?
---
They always said they'd do this. Just read the previous blue posts. They specifically mentioned that if a realm gets overpopulated they'd tell us.
---
Naturally they had to wait until name reservations stabilized.
---
It's ignorant to assume they didn't prepare for it when you don't have any data to support it. Only they know what the data shows from client downloads, stress tests, site traffic etc.
---
Yeah only halflings can ride mechanostriders in vanilla
---
Those 2 content creators are rolling horde on Zandalar Tribe.
---
&gt; That being said, it's pretty obvious that every major decision they did so far, has been influenced by profit and expenditure. The sole reason behind layering and releasing so few servers, was not queues and surely is not about ensuring healthy communities in the long run. It was about saving the most money possible from server infrastructure and it's maintenance with specialized jobs.&gt; 
---
I disagree entirely. I'm almost certain blizzard does not host these servers in house anymore. It's most likely running on something similar to AWS or even AWS. The cost to add servers is probably not even something they consider. What was nostalrius paying a month in server fees? A quick google search says around $1200 a month. $1200 a month to a multibillion dollar corporation is literally nothing. I work for a small business and can tell you that amount a month is negligible. I know the infrastructure is probably far better and more expensive but the point still holds true. They're not *not* adding more servers because they're greedy, they're doing it because they have serious doubts about the population after the first few months. 
---
To expand, I also believe layering is far more computationally intensive then just adding another separate server. I'd argue it costs more to do layering than to just add another server.
---
I believe every single spec CAN be played. That's just how they tuned vanilla raids. The question is how optimal you want your guild to be.
---
Iirc it only affects base intellect and not total so you'd have to do a statistical analysis to notice it.  Play whatever you want.
---
I'll sell them to you for $5

This is why I'm #nochanges

Can’t wait to make money all day pooping portals

Removed as game guide / disc repost, sorry.

Nice!
---
That's literally exactly what I'm saying
---
Isn’t the whole idea of classic to actually enjoy the leveling experience in the 1st place?!
---
Why would people do this at all?
---
Couldn’t be further from the truth..... it is the factual truth with as little bias as possible. I have played exclusively on pvp servers since illidan server first launched. 
---
You shouldn’t blindly defend something just because you have no context as to what is being said. 
---
You want people to believe world PvP was still active and populated after content was on AQ and Naxx..... get the fuck out of here. 
---
Your idea of populated is and must be a joke, and the world was designed to be sparsely populated BY DESIGN, made increasingly worse by BGs, instances and raids. 
---
Very high chance someone like you is the reddit majority that never played vanilla retail seriously only to play private servers much later.
---
Facts fortnite is a shitshow now
---
That’s not semantics at all they intentionally created connected realms to avoid realm closures of all the reasons we’ve been discussing.
---
i like /spit
---
Not trying to nitpick but we have no real idea of population spread on the realms.  Tho shazz will prob the most populated and likely heavily so going by the blue post.  And really its only the name issue preventing moves (though as someone who played classic and got my name back I get it).  No other investment can really be made till launch.
---
Part of the issue is some people actively want the most populated realm, and all the &lt;insert nationality&gt; speaking people roll &lt;best realm here&gt; posts.  The more the player base effects pop density the more blizz will have to adjust to compensate.  Case of too many cooks seasoning a dish without sharing what they doing imo.
---
I was ready to Burn this mother fucker to the ground.
---
I am Ok with Powerleveling Services.

Its linked elsewhere in the thread, but here is the imgur album with what we have done so far https://imgur.com/gallery/GmsPAf9
---
I get what you're saying and I don't know why so many people are coming to this conclusion. He's literally saying they don't want that. They don't want higher ques in phase 2. They're not doing this. They're keeping caps where they are. Why would you infer they're still going to reduce caps even after all that's said?
---
Cause the game relases on the 26th for NA and I still see the occasional NA player who doesn't realize that. It would suck to miss a day.
---
I think Herod isn't a problem that requires a solution. If people are dead-set on playing on a server that busy they are playing on that server because of it's pop.
---
Dota 2 - The International. Quite fun even if you dont play
---
And thats an issue why?
---
Just use search? There is a ton of guides here, u dont have to look at memes if u dont want to.
---
Only thing I can see them being able to fix is class identity but even then you can’t just take a res from a healer that used to have one they would once again be pissed ...
---
And the finals end right before launch
---
&gt;We're all here (with such passion and hype) because we think Classic is an incredible game that is sooo much better than retail.
---
This sub doesn't = the entire population that will try playing classic.
---
Or you know warn people it’s too full and let them decide if they want to deal with that mess. These crazy solutions aren’t needed. People can switch or not, it’s simple as it should be.
---
That would be hard on your mental health
---
Amazed
---
the sad part is they use the same "data" to design Retail around too and it is the sole reason it sucks.
---
It’s true. Once Players realize how hard the grind is, or how slow movement is, or how dungeons work (Summons are tough, cc required, druids can’t res, ect) people will drop off.
---
Yea, when you're in full T3 with a TF and Bulwark.
---
Even then have you seen how much Naxx mobs chunk a DW Fury Tank?
---
The whole point of classic is to finally be able to avoid the fking euros that plagued every private server..
---
Go work and save up. Classic will run on the crappiest of laptops. But I’d advice you to build your own pc. You can build a very capable AMD machine for a couple hundred $.
---
IMO the fact that they require you to get a max toon and then get exalted with a faction that involves a lot of daily quest grinding is a deal breaker. One thing I like about classic is, for the most part, I can grind as much as I want when I want. Being locked behind a daily wall that does nothing but prevent you from getting where you want to go quicker is a pita.
---
So on Nef and Magmadar, casters can out-range the fear. Onyxia is literally the only fight I can think of where WotF is useful and you're spending a gcd (1.5s) to get out of a 3 second fear, once every 2 minutes.
---
Meanwhile Beserking can be used on every fight. And it is especially good as a caster since you can take all your gear off + put it back on with a macro (to start low health) and pop a Demonic rune to get even more haste.
---
The later. Once you click on a guide it will check your quests done,your current quest log and will check it against the guides tasks and remove the ones hat have been completed by you already :)
---
I have only played PvE, but this time I'm rolling PvP to get a different experience. I'm looking forward to the additional challenge.
---
Let's Leave a message to the game industry that they already fucked up by giving us too tier game's in the golden age of gaming, with endless replayability. And if they don't want us playing 15 year old games, something's got to change.
---
Yeah this has been posted before, it's exp needed for each level not time.
---
What’s it like to be such a huge virgin?
---
Hahahahahaha
---
After CoN, I did join a more hardcore raiding guild, but for the life of me I can't remember the name. They kicked me in TBC because I didn't hit 70 in time lol. I had a warrior named Tendrel and a warlock named Tendrelock.
---
But what happens after phase 1, when phasing is gone? The server cap won't be bigger than 4-5k. APES will control the server, trust me, they've already done it on a private server that had between 10-20k players. Rip Gehennas.
---
You will definetly need to have a gathering profession to be able to sustain making leatherworking/blacksmithing stuff, but you could easily go leather/skinnng or blacksmithing/mining and make your own gear to pad out the inevitable competition rogues will face.
---
https://classicwow.live/leveling is great.
---
Sure but the data is 15 years old and there is for sure several version that are all a littl diffrent and noone knows what data was realy live there for sure coud be some errors
---
Yo the ff24 shills are a sight to behold lmao.
---
Are you going to try and get one before Classic?
---
I played vanilla. I played every class to 60 and beyond.
---
Also we were not addon deprived. We had things like Carbonite and way points addons.
---
Hate to break it to you but you don't get to dictate what is fun about classic to me.
---
Leveling as Prot really isn't that much slower because you can fight multiple mobs at a time and once you get revenge + cleave you're laughing while pulling entire camps of mobs.
---
I hope that Classic is very successful forces Blizzard to make retail WoW a better game.
---
Beautiful !! But after two weaks, please eating some vitamins and drink water !
---
Can you throw him off a cliff first
---
Did you know that some people are interested in things that you are not interested in?
---
Combat daggers is unbelievably good. For some reason swords gets a bit more press, possibly because it can be used outside of raids. But the sacrifice you make on positioning (and how utterly gimped you become toe to toe farming) pays off spectacularly in static boss fights. Oh yeah, static boss fights required. It should definitely be best in game for dps.   
---
also, its pretty decent (gold notwithstanding), for switching to cb/prep in pvp which is arguably the most fun rogue in pvp.
---
Yes, but are you PST? I would pick another PST server if you are.
---
If not, I would roll Stalagg.
---
They took away res from guild perk, took away hunter bres, and added cost to cast or cast time to all bres. 
---
There is more evidence that they could vs that they couldn't.
---
Only one package of novalucol? Go get at least one more!
---
&gt; with a separate sub, layering would not be an issue.
---
Fucking lol.
---
I remmeber killing the dude with my 8 lvl hunter , 2mins later he ganks me with lvl??. Retard
---
That’s on private servers where bosses do stupid damage and use their abilities way too often.
---
You’ll get downvoted because no one claimed it would be doable in classic. It’s just a fun video.
---
You could also check FB marketplace you can find some awesome deals there sometimes.
---
Which is the exact reason why people speak in terms of "realms".
---
Not your cup of tea? You seem absolutely triggered by him. Did he piss in your cup of tea? 
---
“Looks like sandy hook shooter” I think you’re the autistic one, the fucks the matter with you?
---
It's not really that bad. You can easily mail items between characters.
---
Mage is better for farming ore. Most ore is deep inside caves filled with mobs. Mages can run in, nova everything, mine the ore and get out. Warriors would have to fight their way through one mob at a time.
---
SOOOOOOO HYPED!!!!!!!
---
They have absolute knowledge as to which data was live and when.
---
Yeah no man, I get that. I want a pc for good games too. Hard to save when you’re a father and don’t have the best job. Not buying a budget one. By don’t have enough for a good one. Every time I get near my money limit I have to use it for something else
---
Thatz AMAZIN! Thank you, Sir!
---
The strength of young blood.
---
It’s a Void Elf, it’s an allied race that were added in BFA.
---
TLDR lore, Elves respond to magic around them hence the changing eye colours and the fact Blood Elves evolved from Highborne when around a font of arcane magic... Void Elves are Blood Elves that changed because of their use of Void magic. They were a controversial addition to the game due to their badly written lore - I don’t like them and wish they’d go away with pandas.
---
Really though. I really wanna jump into classic and get engrossed in it but I know it will cause other aspects of my life to suffer. It’s an internal battle and I’m shook.
---
I currently play on a "high" population server that feels completely dead.
---
I don't know why I'd want to go lower.
---
They don't want to make it worse than they already have. That's the distinction. 
---
They have already added some level of layering which increased the cap temporarily until phase 2. The blue post only said they don't want to exacerbate this more by adding even more layers/population than they already have.
---
I hope so, but honestly doubt it. ): wish I could’ve been ahead of the curb with everyone else
---
Bears will eat a lot of stuff too in a pinch but this is also why I roll boar. Saves me a lot of trouble in the long run.
---
Damn that's both terrifying and exciting.
---
As someone who's not here for the nostalgia, I'm looking forward to getting utterly bent over in a few days.
---
There are many guides and mechanics breakdowns on YouTube videos.
---
I was planning on using classicwow.live but this seems great to have it integrated. Do you have a breakdown of the route it takes you on?
---
lol, thats very different.
---
People are reserving names and then getting out of there and going to another server to reserver a name. When the games out.. you're not going to have that.
---
Trust me, I was there on NOv 24th 2004 on a high pop server. It was 45 minutes to 1 hour for like the first few months at night when trying to login. And that was not even close to 10k.
---
should be in drama or gossip communities, the subreddit is just 90% drama at this point.
---
I never found it particularly hard gearing as a troll hunter. 2/3's of the shaman specs don't want the +agi mail so you only really fight with those filthy enhancement shammy's. Either are perfectly fine and the racials tend to even out for hunters. I would say go for whichever run and shooting animations you prefer since you will be seeing it a LOT. Orcs have the classic William Tell style and trolls hold that sucker sideways like a gat in 1994. Also orcs have proportionally gigantic shoulder armor so if you like that about WoW, then orcs are fun.
---
It's basically guaranteed.
---
Yes kids are expensive
---
awww man there's so many of these stories on here &lt;/3
---
As it should be. People are choosing a name and getting out. People wont be logging into the world and then quitting after 30 seconds on game day... 
---
Good luck man.
---
The issue has more to do with 1-2 days prior to name reservation. everyone told their friends what server to pick.
---
This is the main issue, People aren't gonna leave the bigger servers because they put to much effort into telling everyone to go there.

Enhance in vanilla was not end game raid competitive, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun playing it.
---
Probably should get rid of this one and go buy a pc, life would be easier!
---
Ikr I feel sick just looking at that lol.
---
Man this is making me wonder if troll priest over troll mage
---
Lmao
---
I reckon both will be complete shit on launch as Stalagg will be the realm all the day #1 subscribers will likely go to
---
I played on low pop back in the day and there was never a lack of people on.  You'll end up meeting good players that play the same times as you and add them as friends.  Don't worry.  My 2 coppers.
---
So you missed the first two days AND changed day 1? This meme is already stretched thin.
---
Its capped in the sense that if they allow infinite name reservations they will dig themselves a grave for the end of P1. In the blue list they state their ability to raise it, but choose not to. That doesn't mean they wont use layering to the maximum of its ability during phase 1 to minimise bad player experience. There will be queues, but they 100% wont be 6hrs. 
---
I'm on EU and am not even facing this problem, but have a good understanding of how their system will work. I'll see if I can find some recent posts regarding the subject for you.

Arms warrior is insanely good in bg’s. It is not very good in duels as they can be kited. If you have a healer though you will be a juggernaut of destruction and mortal strike is essential for your team getting kills in group fights. iirc shadow priests were really good in duels but everyone kind of disliked them because holy priests are so valuable that it’s a major disappointment dealing with a shadow priest. They want to play with holy not shadow.
---
Same. I went rp-pvp my first time around. And it had its ups and downs. 
---
This time I just want chill mode, and not have to worry about gankers.
---
That is a while and it could die in dev hell but mmorpgs should take a while. Wow took at least like 5 years and a modern mmorpg would likely have much more lofty goals these days which makes it require more time/rescources. I would be much more concerned if they rushed out a piece of crap.
---
Alliance version?

This is turning into r/roastme with all these WoW Tattoo's. Why not Tattoo Nike on your foot, Levi's on your Leg, Bjorn Borg on your ass, Tommy on your Chest, Rolex on your wrist, Gilette on your cheek, Ray Ben on your Temple and New Era on your Forehead. 
---
Individualising based on commerce is about the most anti indivialistic thing you can do.

How come?

I think IK Edit also got a job with them. I know I've seen his work used in the arena tournament advertisements, at least. Not sure if that's just contract work or a full time gig. Hurricane and IK Edit's styles are pretty similar to me, so I may just be mixing them up.
---
Indeed! I have two and will only be able to play an hour or two after they go to sleep. Depending on how much sleep I can sacrifice
---
There's already WoW like this, Ascension high risk.
---
What do you mean by H0?
---
Having a quick look, you're looking at $400-700 and 20 days time
---
People in 2019 are still struggling to run classic WoW? What the fuck?

Or you just leave if you don’t want to deal with the queues.

If you are unable to handle the stress of your plans being altered because of someone else then don't roll on a PvP server. PvP servers add more drama and uncertainty, for some people this can cause extreme stress or anger.
---
3PM?
---
Depending on where you live in NA and EU, EU is up to 11 hours in advance... So the advantage might be smaller than you thought?! :-)
---
I'd say it's Fortnite with the biggest impact with Minecraft a close second.  There's an entire generation of kids hooked on Fortnite and That's gonna lead to an entire generation of adults used to microtransactions being a standard part of their gaming experience.

---
I would consider Lock or Shaman then, Lock has plenty of tricks and utility they lack in retail.
---
If you are on a different layer and group up with someone you will switch to their layer. At least that's what I experienced in the stress test when I wanted to meet up and buy something from someone and couldn't see them until we grouped up
---
What people always forget about the EverQuest death penalty is, sure you lose experience on death, but that experience loss can be mitigated by another player. If you get a Cleric friend to Rez you, you gain up to 97%-100% of the exp back. Clerics could even have a little Rez business set up for side money. 
---
It made you rely on other players and added to the sense of community.
---
I'm not so sure how true that will be in classic in regards to herb. The spawn timers on the lotus and such is way longer than private servers and as such I suspect will have just as bad a farming monopoly as devilsaur leather. I dunno what the going rate for non flask herbs are but I would rather just not have to buy the thorium for arrows and occasionally get an arcane crystal to sell then hope I get the 2 a day black lotus drops.
---
The level 25 ones have level 3 lightning breath and it's a great focus dump for that level range. Not sure about other levels of wind serpent, but that one specifically gives him a big power spike.

What server ?
---
85% of the player base are returning Vanilla vets. There will be minimal drop offs.
---
I made that number up btw.
---
This guy makes god tier videos, check out his naxx one it’s absolutely fantastic
---
That is a solution, but it is not the classic experience :)
---
I held off at first but just remade my character on Stalaag. I'd rather actually play the game rather than wait in queue. Hopefully the server doesn't die off in a few months but we'll see what happens.

You Chug that Salad Dressing, and be damn proud of it.
---
&gt;when we group up via battlenet (is that even possible in classic?), will we port to the same layer?
---
&gt;Aren't layers supposed to guarantee no queues?
---
If they wanted to, yes, but they will still have a player cap so the servers don't get too full.
---
Thanks! This guide will be really helpful if my wife and I actually manage to get to max level :\^)

HANZ ! CAST ZE WINDFURHER TOTTEM !

It wouldnt work with what WoW became eventually, but you have to remember it started off as a much, much different game. The original proof of concept was just a War3 mod, so in the design phase im sure they kicked around ideas about how to make 150 players work, probably something like diablo 3 drop in/drop out servers, persistent character but nothing else.
---
Death is truely the best interrupt
---
Goddamit! i was looking for a helpful tips thread and was all ready to bask in my glory, but you beat me to it. I always did this on my NE characters.
---
I feel like that game isn’t that great. Every class is the same. They all rotate through X&gt;Y&gt;Z abilities for rotation and they glow when they’re supposed to be used. I played FF14 when it first came out before they fixed it. That was almost better than it is now.

Is connection through usb actually ok in case of speed? Won't be the gaming lagging and things like that? :). Do I need SSD or pure harddrive will be ok?
---
Playing a character to 60 and gearing in vanilla is such an undertaking I wouldn't suggest playing something you're not stoked about just because your guild says they need someone to. Either recruit a tank externally or someone else can swap. Play what you feel.

Adding xp to bgs, and allowing people to lock up, was the best thing for battlegrounds. I really wish it was a part of classic. That way the twinks can fight each other and everyone else can enjoy bgs. 
---
The only ones who will complain are the people who suck at pvp and can only win if the have some kind of advantage over everyone else.
---
Are there so many people playing no mans sky?
---
I’m thoroughly thankful for your guide! Maybe you can help me with a thought of mine:
---
I’m on a budget and recently reactivated my old desktop (rocking an AMD Phenom 2 X4 955 CPU, 4 Gigs of ram and an ATI 5770 GPU). I just bought a 4k TV (that’s why I’m on a budget now) and was wondering if there’s any way I can play classic in 4k resolution with as little upgrades to my rig as possible?
---
I currently plan on buying a SSD as they are so cheap right now aswell as a used GPU with at least 2 gigs of VRAM. 
---
Is something bottlenecking my 4k plans? I don’t really want to change the CPU. What should I look for in terms of GPUs? Is 4 gigs of ram enough, does it even matter?
---
Advices are much appreciated 😊
---
HF with the &lt;APES&gt;

And also the state of Montana. Over 1 million people total here now. Gettin' down right hard to breathe with all these stinking people around.
---
Idk about that, but you certainly seem to have some deep insider knowledge. What makes you think that so many hardcore people would play an easy game such as classic? 
---
Not really, not at all. Lots of guilds do these, same as back in vanilla. 
---
Does hardcore mean you go out of your way to grief others? If so, yes they are hardcore.
---
They aren’t a fly by night operation they have more than “the dude managing the databases” but ok.

 As a XIV player since before relaunch, while the relaunch fixed a lot of problems it also added a lot of current Gen MMO problems as well. Outside of the story (XIV feels like a single player game with people running around) it’s a glorified dungeon crawl at best, much like current WoW. It’s a shame people don’t want to go back to the old school socializing, such a better experience.
---
I think they're gonna be bigger than ever before. People have grown up and thus they generally have more money but less time :P
---
Even with layers a server will still have concurrency caps. Layers change this concurrency cap from 3k to like 20k, for example. However, once you hit that 20k cap, you will be stuck waiting to get in.
---
I'm not crying! You're crying! 
---
In all seriousness, I dread the day when I have to bury my parents. It's going to wreck me. I hope you can make many more memories with wow. I'm sure your dad would want that.
---
I'll bet you $100 even odds that day 1 is the most concurrent players in classic's life.
---
Thanks for the response guys \^\^
---
I'm honestly super perplexed by people thinking classic is going to fail. Vanilla WoW was the fastest selling and most successful MMO of it's time when it released. It shook the genre to it's core and killed 75% of it's competition. Vanilla WoW during it's time was more successful that FF14 is currently. Vanilla WoW was a cultural event. South Park hasn't made a FF14 episode, Toyota hasn't made a commercial using FF14 and celebrities aren't crawling out of the wood work to make commercials for FF14. I don't see people doing on late night talk shows admitting they play FF14. Vanilla WoW was, and still is a great game. These people act like somehow the age of something is the only determining factor in it's quality. There have been like dozens of private classic wow servers over the years. These private vanilla wow server communities have literally been thriving for a decade but as far as I can tell there are literally no private servers for FF14.

It releases for everyone worldwide at the same time, so its not an advantage lol. Some NA people just don't get that and they dont factor in time zones.
---
How would you go about leveling engineering without mining?
---
Yes but no one is meaning it as an actual physical server.
---
But 3pm PST on the 26th is 12 am on the 27th in EU, so it’s releasing at the same time for everyone...
---
The main benefit of RP servers isnt the RP, it's not being surrounded by stupid fucking names.
---
Druids are gonna prove this song wrong! *Shakes fist*
---
How does that NOT matter? Layering destroys the vanilla experience and it'll be around for a completely undetermined amount of time

I'm the opposite.  I spent the first 6 years on PvP realms and I have absolutely no desire to revisit that. All of the positive social interaction I had came in dungeons, raids, and BGs.

If you switch the 'Dungeons' and 'Leveling' spec chart it would look a bit cleaner.

---
No there is no timer. I deleted my name multiple times and created a new one right away.
---
It should be available immediately. Are you sure you're spelling it the same way? If so somebody might have sniped the name.
---
No... I'm saying Herod won't have a higher concurrent player cap than any other server. Therefore, it won't be any bigger than any other full server... just have a longer queue time.
---
Try again - it was instantly available for me, deleted and recreated all 3
---
Just name a server Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.
---
Same here man, let's hope for the best
---
Nope. I’m going Grob and I don’t RP. The RP on the server helps keep some of the riff raff out. It turns them away. It’ll still have plenty of drama and competition. I played on the release of Lightninghoof in vanilla.
---
It is about wow.  I never liked the /r/wow rule that the vid or pic has to be from wow to make the post something about wow.  It confines the content too much.

Coz in vanilla you cannot play with the people on the other realms

There's plenty of time for dodging higher level mobs on long walks to grab flightpaths later on. :)
---
This is nasty but half these Redditors don’t wanna admit the amount of cigarettes and energy drinks they’re gunna pound on launch

Me and my friend have popular names. There is no timer

This is the best recommendation. You get all the hype and all the relevance lore-wise. I will be doing this tonight.

thats a good way to kill battlegrounds
---
I agree, there are some things fixed later that I would prefer to have in classic. It seems like there is no middle ground on Classic though, you either go full classic or go home. Maybe they will consider a special rule set server that votes on changes like this in the future.
---
I hunted the guy &amp; his friend (also paladin twink) with my twink, one of them took his 60 too. I ended up letting my twink there to kill him everytime I could.
---
I like the near afk level of relax for leveling and being able to tank 5 mans if I want. I’m also ok with the idea of being a one button heal and buff bot if I ever decide to try and raid, which, if I’m being honest with myself, I will never actually have the time for.
---
For someone who will play very casually doesn’t care about being competitive about anything and just wants to enjoy the WORLD of Warcraft it’s not only not a bad class, it’s actually outstanding because in open world and small group play you can perform two always needed roles very well, and for soloing you can easily do lots of things that are out of reach for any other class.
---
Realistically every class at endgame only has one designated role in which they’re widely considered viable for raids, cause that’s just how classes were built back then. And between the two you will have a lot easier time finding a heal spot than a tank spot. So I’m ok with healing being my assigned role if I want to raid.
---
Yeah once I saw that picture my though was "Yeaaaaah, this doesn't end well."
---
The point I was making was that in the past there was a physical correlation between hardware and server numbers.  These days, with configurable virtual machines in the cloud, that correlation has moved on.  That's all I was saying.  Nothing to do with what people say or think.
---
Is there any reason the layers can't be infinitely spawned to accommodate 100% of players who want to get in on day one, then gradually collapsed over time as people fall off?  I really don't see any need for queues during the first few days.
---
Not being able to play at all due to overcrowding and/or keventually being on dead realms also destroys the vanilla experience. Rather high pop layered realms than that.
---
/r/mmorpg is depressing they hate all games.  I guess they were hyped for phantasy star online 2 which comes out next year.  Only issue with that game is theres no open world its just town and dungeons.  Its like warframe/vindictus.
---
Okay got it now. But it didnt seem unrealistic for me though, if the release wasnt worldwide at the same time, since NA gets new content first for example... But good to know, thx for the explanations! :-)

---
The whiners will be legion, but will deserve no sympathy.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see some larger guilds who care about world firsts going elsewhere though. Because world first anything will be impossible on Herod if there are 10+ hour queues.
---
Perhaps a bot. You can try to report it to Blizzard to investigate the new owners activity for anything suspicious.
---
Cool story bro
---
He made a blanket statement, subreddit doesn't matter, he said there were no low pop servers, that would be an incorrect statement to make.
---
That would actually be amazing. It was an obscure reference and that would imply some dude just sitting there trying it for days or getting really lucky
---
What's the point of spending a couple hundred gold on a lvl 19 character if I can't 1 shot normies in battlegrounds?
---
This sub is worse than r/WoW for shutting down posts because they are critical.
---
tho sometimes it was laggy and it took like a minute before your group ended up together.
---
and other times it was buggy and randomly decided you don't get to play with your friends anymore and throws you into a different layer even tho you're grouped.
---
Ah, so it's as pointless as any other petition.
---
For Barrens hyenas, fml xD
---
Why can't they just allow space in names?
---
Honestly you won't if you need a step buy step guide.
---
to prevent queue
---
That makes a ton of sense.  Thank you!
---
&gt;sing each layer supports 5,000 concurrent play sessions: You allow for a max of 10 layers, you get 50K players concurrently.  The 50,001 player to connect is queue
---
This is not true and there's literally no evidence to support them doing this. If you read this, it clearly states they won't be removing caps as that would cause higher ques:
---
 *Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.* 
---
If what you're saying is correct, he'd be using completely different wording
---
I’m in Afghanistan for this launch.....almost sucks but I stay busy enough to avoid the hype, and I’ll get a month to play when I get back.
---
Going on Stalagg and realm hopping at 60 to Herod to dodge the queues.
---
# BAKAMONO GA DOITSU NO KAGAKU WA SEKAI ICHI
---
This is r/mmorpg in a nutshell.
---
I leveled to 60 in vanilla with a VW tank.  In fact you pretty much have to use it on a PvP server for the sac if you get ganked.  It holds threat fine if you're not a mongoloid though by level #6 or so it does start to get pulled off relatively fast.  It's a balance between your mana, your hp, vw mana, vw hp, and mob kill time.  It's a beautiful balance and what makes leveling a warlock so much fun.  If you cast a shadow bolt or immolate you will almost certainly take aggro.  But a couple dots and wanding?  You'll probably get it low enough before aggro to where it will die before it gets to you.  
---
Either way that is preferable to not having VW sac when some rogue comes to gank you.
---
I mean, that's suspicious. Maybe they really are working on an MMO? An MMO is a 5+ year development window.
---
If by gold farming you mean grind potential, I think AOE farming from a mage will our produce a hunter. However if you’re considering leveling quicker, then level 60 grinding will likely out produce a lower level AOE farmer.
---
Really?
---
Only watched 2 of his vids but both of them had an insane amount of commercials on them... like 8+. I remember seeing that at the start and just thinking fuck this guy right at the start.
---
Yeah. It been a while. My bad
---
It’s very good connection, I always use with my iMac, almost same speed as internal. Get ssd, normal too slow.
---
I'd rather use Ublock Origin so WoWhead is significantly better than those sites that rely on pserver data or burning crusade values
---
I know it hurts, ppl don't like pain :c
---
The exp from killing mobs with someone that massively outlevels you is very bad. Like a 10th of the exp you’d get if he was your level. The wowhobbs videos were cool back then but realistically a group of competent players at the correct level will be able to level way faster than that.
---
Tl;dr: not enough creative freedom
---
Sadly with this whole thing we've got to take some bad with the good. Otherwise we end up tweaking the game back into what retail is now. I personally would love the xp on bgs upgrade though and I think most players would.
---
11pm uk time for me.
---
In terms of the weekly farm for Sapper Charges and grenades does that make the need for mining pointless, as the only reason I had that on any room, was to farm Mats for those items. 
---
In terms of the mage, it will purely be to farm gold on and have as a solid AOE grinder that I can just AFK in the background on my second account and farm gold while doing the important things on my warrior! 
---
Totally hear what you are saying about enchanting though, so I might just forget about enchanting all together and have Alch/Tailoring on the mage for the Passive Gold Income and with Pots being the bulk of my spending, I can just dodge forking out for them by brewing them myself!
---
My friends and guild is on Fairbanks.  We are currently sitting at high pop.  NONE of us want to wait in massive queues.  We all have jobs and want to be able to log in at night.  
---
If Fairbanks turns into Herod/Whitemane we would move in a heartbeat.  Names or not. 
---
What we dont like is this dance Blizzard is doing with only making new servers when the rest are already over populated.  Making it awkward to really decide where to play on launch
---
4 GB of RAM is the lowest I'd really want to recommend. Should be fine though and not cause any issues in performance.
---
There are a lot of variables here so it's hard for me to say this easily, but, I think something like a GTX 1060 or RX 580 would be enough for 4K in Classic, though maybe you'll need to lower some settings. I'm not super comfortable with this recommendation though; as mentioned, lots of variables here. So, please take my suggestions with a grain of salt!
---
Some im a girl who uses 'guys' and 'dude' a lot and play a male character. I generally don't like to stick out.   
---
But im starting to regret it cause half of you really believe it's all dudes in here.
---
I always felt like healing was fun without them. I was actually playing my class instead of an addon doing it for me.
---
Unless you're on a PvP server and not literally the highest level person.  If a rogue comes by and sees a warlock without a VW out they are basically looking at a free kill.
---
Because they need to remove layering before phase 2, if they let everyone in day 1 then people will have no reason to leave and will be FUCKED come phase 2.
---
Kid, you are making a fool out of yourself. I had 5 Level60 in Vanilla and had Chars on Nost, Ely and Lightbringer. I'm better than you. Have fun seeing MC in December.
---
I don’t think their really gonna be as a big problem as people making them out to be. Maybe at the very top end.
---
Yeah I can breathe after 55 cus it already feels like you’re a big boy in the endgame
---
In that case i will be playing
---
Yeah, he could at least drink diet soda.
---
That sounds like me. I don't like fighting over loot. So I am, sure I'll stick with the human patchwork mage.
---
How long does it take you to go out and buy some food? Even 2 weeks worth of food. Under an hour, surely.
---
I cant tell anything about the world Bosses as i have never even tried for one because of the hardcore guilds always camping for the spawn. There will always exist guilds who is more "tryhard" than others on both sides. Even more now when the server player limit is much higher
---
That will be bottlenecked by USB transfer speeds.
---
Good luck having someone power level you with mob tagging severely nerfed compared to private servers.

Don't forget to post this tomorrow, and the day after that
---
Every single guild I've been in where DKP has been used people have massively exploited the system in multiple ways.  Issues lead to the raid leaders just shrugging and basically saying "well that's our system"
---
None of the guilds I've been in that used Loot Council have had any issues with unfair loot distribution. Strangely enough guilds that aren't fucking shit don't want to screw over their raiders so they leave the guild, I know this is a hard concept for some people to grasp.
---
I'd imagine this will get heavily downvoted because the echo chamber on this sub is that loot council is designed to fuck you over at every chance possible and every guild has to be conspiring to make loot distribution as unfair as possible.
---
Thanks! I'll probably lean toward Shaman and play Enhance but lock will certainly come to mind, I'll have to go watch some videos

FFxiv is more like a single player game with multiplayer aspects than a true mmorpg.  Its more like bfa than classic.  It has a good single playe campagin.
---
Your response has no relevance to my point.  I don't think you understand what I was saying.  I was talking about the infrastructure that powers WoW.  It's got nothing to do with cross-realm play.
---
Can someone explain the last day? I don’t get it.
---
Ah cool, didn't know there was a website. Good stuff! Thanks
---
There's no experience from batllegrounds in classic and those who love low level pvp would surely twink their toons as well if they are staying in a certain bracket.
---
That last line rings true for all of us
---
Not interested in seeing this type of comment
---
 Nope I’m pretty sure it doesn’t matter what level and certainly not if you kill a bis first, I could be wrong, but as far as I know you can go back at 60 and do all low level quests you haven’t done. Were you going to do every starting zone quests in your faction too? That’s going to take forever 😂 you’ll make a huge chunk of gold after all of it though if you manage to do it
---
That would be absolutely ridiculous as only a % of players will be online at any given time.
---
imagine being a person that actually buys a boost lmfao omg
---
Good idea. It would just way too fucking weird of a coincidence - especially this late in the name reserving game. I made the name hour 1 but accidentally made it the wrong class rofl
---
The reason I paid early was to make sure I can actually create a character on the realm. They shut off new character creations back in the day for full realms, so I'm not risking not being able to play with my friends, which is exactly what happened the first time around. 
---
But if my friends hadnt picked a realm that was already "full" on day 1, I would have waited.
---
I suppose I can ignore the lack of ladies on the classic crew and laugh at this inaccurate meme
---
Knew somebody would make a reference
---
Hey. Yes, I made cdframes. Unfortunately it's gonna be one of the most annoying (and partially impossible) to port since the APIs it uses changed very drastically. I may still attempt to port it at some point but the ones listed in this thread are the ones I'm working on with highest priority.
---
Like what
---
The poll here (IIRC this predates streamer confirmation and even Brasil) had Herod as the highest pop server.
---
off the top of my head I can't think of any "impossible" quests. Some that are hard without certain classes or groups or even professions but nothing that's straight up not possible.
---
More people? You don't even know the cap so how do you know how many people their servers can handle?
---
In the games graphics settings, there's a dropdown to choose which graphics card you're using. Don't use autodetect, manually select the dedicated GPU.
---
First a tattoo, then 5 shitposts saying the same thing about stranglethorn vale being a warzone. 
---
Theres like 20 shitposts for every discussion post. It's already worse than wow, and overwatch subs.
---
I honestly dont think it will be widely successful. It will be successful because there are tons of people who have missed wow. WoW is the kind of game you invest and take time into playing. A lot of the younger generation didnt grow up with slow paced games.
---
I've seen people say 50% will stop. I actually agree on that because WoW is one of those games you focus on a lot. It's your main game. Down time is when maybe youd play a different game.  People who never played WoW and ride the hype train. looking at pvp videos of people owning noobs thinking its skill and so on wont last. Today's generation of gamers or fed fast paced flashy games. Those gamers are going to get to level 20 and quit because like I said WoW isnt just a game. It's a serious commitment that requires sacrificing things
---
It would help i am garbage at spelling
---
It's most likely a bot programmed to keep pressing enter so when you delete the character the name instantly becomes theirs.
---
Ok?
---
When op says “no change” he means it!
---
But don't click direclty on the Download button on the right, you need to go to the Addon's page -&gt; Files -&gt; Download the last 1.13.X one
---
Split in 3 is too much. Split in two is probably even too much while stalag stays at medium. Based on things blizzard has said in the past that 10000 person queue is at most 1/3 of a server cap for launch. 
---
But also, more importantly, opening a server where nobody can roll on it except for people from a certain other server. But they can’t even create characters on it but only transfer to it using a UI flow that might not even exist in the client anymore. Is not really an easy ask. Even if they wanted to I doubt it could be done before launch without any bugs.
---
Some people just have no idea of how difficult what they are asking for really is.
---
Pfft, next you'll be asking for Murlocs to drop their eyes for that random quest more than one in 30 kills.
---
You aren't forced to transfer you CHOOSE to transfer and upon CHOOSING to transfer you CHOOSE a new name if it's taken. Your option forces people to change their names against their will. My server is fine. Why should _I_ have to change _MY_ name because my server got merged with these idiots?
---
now ive heard of boomer music but this is ridiculous i was expecting muddy waters in the last half of the video
---
Preach, brother. Don’t let the man keep you down!
---
The "it's just nostalgia" people always were a small minority on r/wow. 
---
r/wow in general was very positive about Classic from the very beginning. 
---
Why do you guys keep lying about that?
---
Are you sure? We have to train specific mounts instead of just riding. Have they said the mechanostrider restrictions won’t be in place?
---
Jesus. Send some of that shit to blizzard.
---
Yeah, the low effort rule sucks, if it's funny who gives a shit?
---
No. Need retail subsribble for classic.
---
All u need is a subscription to world of Warcraft, I don't even think you need to buy any of the games. I believe it's free to lvl up to 20, by since u need a sub to play classic it's kinda moot anyway. Just download the blizzard app and go to the wow tab, click the drop-down menu and switch it to classic then install
---
I'm fairly certain they can. I think the server caps are artificial to get people to spread out across servers in preparation for the removal of layering/phasing. If every server had extremely long queues then they would likely raise the cap or add more servers.
---
Doch!
---
I think most addons take away from the game and you definitely don’t need them right away. Although later on some guilds might want you to have a couple specific ones for raiding. Atlas loot is pretty nice because you can quickly search dungeon bosses and find out what they drop,  but there isn’t much you can’t find out from a database page open in the background.
---
Pokemon go growing. Who the fuck plays that anymore ?
---
You only need a battlenet account and a subs. You do not need to buy Retail.
---
Question like this one they haven’t clarify. However, they have said that “classic wow comes with your subscription of WoW” I think they refer that you don’t need to purchase retail, rather just have the subscription.
---
You do not have to buy BFA, just have subscribtion to WoW
---
I too did the PVP server thing for years and I'm not going to bother. I don't feel any sense of accomplishment taking out weaker players and my ability to play probably means I'll still be in the 30s or 40s well after people to get to 60 and are bored.
---
World of Warcraft PVP = trolling like 75% of the time. Attacking a vulnerable target who is low on health fighting a mob or attacking a target when you have backup or just straightup attacking someone 30/40/50 levels lower. 
---
The actual full health vs full health nothing on cooldown equal level fights are the rarity. Most PVP severs end up( or in this case) start off with large faction inbalances. I will play battlegrounds, but world pvp? Nah.
---
yeah totally.
---
Tomorrow is my turn!
---
That's "one group". Not the same as coordinating 2 seperate groups that you're the one mutual.
---
So since i cant do that, i'll give you another super secret tip. Around stormgarde keep in arathi highlands is a cave that brings you to the sea and a bunch of undead (i think) pirates. Theres a couple of sunk ships. In one of those ships is a chest. In that chest is a weapon that puts a dot on the person who equips it (The skull of impending doom). Sure, it seems absolutely useless. But...
---
If youre stuck in a trap or cc that breaks on damage... and happen to have a weapon swap macro...   
---
It also lets you kill yourself in a clear wipe saving costs. Oh, and the speed buff is nice for reaching those boats.   
---
Pretty awesome utility item
---
You just need a Subscription to play Classic WoW.
---
Duo leveling can be faster, depends on the class. A warrior might benefit more from having a healer. But sone quests do require a full-ish party (they are tagged as Elite quests)
---
As for a guild there should be a page on the forum. Depends on your realm.
---
They stated in the past that it was a feature back in vanilla.
---
But resto is the optimal raiding spec, the only other viable one is bear.
---
No you don’t need the expansions  all you need is a sub. Don’t spread incorrect information
---
Healthy food will make you last longer and will help you grind better!
---
... If you're into lore.
---
That's pretty much how those dungeons were designed to be done.  Running *all* of BRD in one go is fucking nuts and takes a whole afternoon even if you're high enough to do it.  Uldaman was very clearly split, the quest even gives you the staff so you can jump right to the final section from the get go.  Upper and Lower BRS might as well have been two different dungeons entirely.
---
They were experimenting with more organic ways to split dungeons up into separate wings without it being as explicit as it was in Scarlet Monastery.  Turns out that just confused people so with TBC they flat out made each dungeon have separate wings that were totally split dungeons and that's what people liked. /shrug
---
current online on Steam: 50223
---
Sorry, reading is hard
---
But he didn't finish the addon which he said he would try to. Going to lose out on a lot of people because of this.
---
truth
---
I mean, all of the quests have minimum level requirements, so yea, there's tons of that.
---
As far as quests go, the only thing I can really think of is the Centaurs in Desolace. You have to align yourself with one of the Centaurs clans and then the quests for the opposite clan become unavailable. No really way around it though, would just have to pick the opposite one on an alt.
---
u/Bagaan’s teeth: Oooof
---
I'm just surprised nomansky is here, I expected classic to be up there.
---
I mean all the polls so far, with a few big one with over 50k votes show that there is only 3-4% that are women, so the meme i far from inaccurate :). Men are a very big majority in the gaming scene, not a secret. World of Warcraft retail has 15% women or so though. So by those numbers it would be 3 women on every 100 men, so that this car is full off men is the highly likely .
---
/Sincerely meme valid committee
---
No, you dont need to buy expansions to play classic, you just need a subscription
---
No one said that.... they just said servers
---
Have you tried changing your mind every 5 minutes on what class and faction to play?  It's really helping to pass the time for me.
---
Classic WoW and retail WoW aren’t really competing. People that play retail are doing it because they like the modern storytelling, accessibility, and more skill based pve. These things aren’t present in classic.
---
If classic is going to be wildly successful it’s going to be people coming private servers, others games, or just coming back after not playing anything for a while.
---
I’ve got a laptop that’s good for gaming, but I want a pc so bad, it’s so much better for playing wow!
---
Things pve server players just dont get.
---
Right, tho at this point idk if you could even buy wow standalone, isn't it all just bundled to BFA now?
---
Hahahah best comment
---
Everyone rolling on a PVP server cannot opt out of being randomly ganked or blocked from entering instances by a group multiple times the size of your own.
---
Players on PVE servers can opt in to world PVP.
---
Screaming at your own employees? Who cares. 
---
Bleeding money to making cringe music videos? Who cares. 
---
Demanding a right to have sex - what’s that? Like I don’t even know what it means. I’ll take a link if you have it, couldn’t find anything on google search
---
To play efficiently, how retarded can you be? Or have you memorized every fucking step from 1-60? There are some Quests that have like 20 Steps and you need to pick up a Quest for Swamp of Sorrows in Stormwind. 
---
If you want to play as efficiently as possible you need to follow a Guide.
---
They are ruining my playtime because you guys are ruining the way I play.
---
cool?
---
Can't you tank in arms spec for a large majority of the leveling process with no real issues? Not sure but I feel like that was a thing.
---
It was only free, because you could torrent/download it, like any of the other guides out there. If you want it 'legally' it cost money like about any other decent guide.
---
So it really wasn't any different than all the others.
---
And you'd be wrong.
---
I'm apart of about half a dozen large guild discords because I wasn't sure which one I wanted to join. All are vehemently opposed to switching to Stalagg and expecting everyone else to. This is going to go poorly.
---
Well its hard to tell until we're in the future, but as things stand right now i don't think you can make much of a case of that. Try some googling about wows cultural impact.
---
Very impressive! Do you happen to have a link to the playlist you used in the video? I kinda dig it
---
As a member of the osrs community, many held the same view (myself included) and now osrs has I believe twice the player base as rs3(it took a few years but it shows that at least in a game like that, people enjoy the lack of QoL features and a grindier slower game). And I believe the difference between wow classic and retail is similar enough that wow classic overtaking retail is a real possibility. Moreover osrs is orders of magnitude more grindy than wow classic, so the idea that people hate slow progression is questionable. The most important thing I believe for classic being able to overtake retail is how Blizzard manages the game at the end of vanilla content.
---
I'll have to create a [battle.net](https://battle.net) account for her and poke around, from memory the only subscribe buttons always hovered around my retail accounts. Perhaps you can choose to create a classic account and sub to that now?
---
Early 2000s Blizzard really did a great job creating a game that, while complicated, really takes very little effort to learn as you gradually and naturally progress through it.  I wouldn’t worry about that part at all. Just enjoy your first adventure through Azeroth. 
---
As for what you need to purchase: you need an active subscription (~$15/mo) and you need to have the classic client installed.  I could be wrong, but I think Classic WoW is included in that at this point in the games life.
---
Retail doesn’t need to be saved, it’s fine how it is, classic is t better it’s just different. It’s okay to like different things.
---
Clone the server and give everybody 3 days to pick one. That west everyone can keep their names.
---
Don't pick Troll for their improved bow skill, ranged weapon skills are far less important than melee since ranged weapons don't suffer from glancing blows.
---
I played Orc Warrior and wore Lightforge (iirc) Paladin shoulders (gold/yellow ones) for a long time due to bad luck xD
---
I don’t think you understand the concern behind APE, no reason to keep going.
---
Spin up two additional servers. Randomly migrate characters to them. Guarantee friends are separated and names flagged for name change. Yup, totally painless.
---
No time for hussies when I am slaying so much in Azeroth.
---
Too many people on a server is a fixable problem that they already have a solution for.  Server merging is much more disastrous.  
---
What they don't know is what the drop off is going to be.  Is 10% of the pop at launch staying for longer than 2 months?  Did you know that for every 10 active players, only 1 is online at a given time on average?.   So if 10% stay for longer than 2 months and 10% of those people are active, each server that starts with 100k, that leaves 1000 active at any one time.  
---
But this is conjecture.  We and they are only guessing.  It's better to underestimate than over estimate the number of servers.
---
Up to 110 is “free” just gotta pay a sub
---
Sorry I should have said he wasn’t trying to break his record.  Thanks
---
I got one to show everyone how dedicated I am to my undead frost mage. Do you like it?

I thought I remembered something about being able to ride other race’s mounts if you get exalted with that city.
---
I'll have to create an account for her and have a look. cheers boss
---
How long you think dw cool down is
---
I love the subtle green hills of go fuck yourself at the end =)
---
Never even heard of that game - just looked it up now. I know graphics aren't everything, but it just doesn't look very pleasing at all. Very dark and dreadful, animations are amateur-ish.
---
This could never compete with WoW lol
---
Serious question, isn't brokentooth overrated ? I mean, the pushback is nice but imo it's nothing in comparison to boars stun/root ? Ofc i would go brokentooth vs casters in duels, but out in the world / bgs, shouldnt you always have your boar up for those pesky rogues / warriors ?
---
I am also ok with level 1 bots spelling out 'sex leg' mid-air in Orgrimmar to complete the classic experience.
---
&gt;To play efficiently
---
Umm...no...constantly having to look at a guide step by step isn't playing efficiently. IT's being bad at the game and needing other people to tell you what to do lol
---
&gt;Or have you memorized every fucking step from 1-60?
---
The actual good players who will be doing MC and wrote the guides have. Not you though apparently.
---
Me personally, I love IceHud. I havent checked if it will be out for classic yet though. It basically makes transparent life and resource bars around your character for you and your target. I find it hard to play wow without it now.
---
This is the effect that meta parrots have on the average player. The reason you have this impression is because people have a way of talking about the game that makes everything feel set in stone. X class is garbage. Y class is optimal etc.. If you deviate from this you are somehow "wrong."
---
But the truth is there is a vast number of people who do no give a ***fuck*** about any of that. Those people tend to have much more moderate opinions in general, that is if they even go online to voice them at all. 
---
I'll reiterate my first point: A lot of people saying these things are just repeating what they've seen other people say. It's a pissing contest to show off how much they "know" about the game to feel superior. 
---
Most of the people actually doing heavy min-maxing are going to be busy doing that, and finding other people who play the game like they do, not telling the masses how they should be enjoying the game. 
---
There will be no shortage of people out there looking to play with people who just want to enjoy and experience the game as fresh as possible. 
---
Even in the modern game, there are video guides for every raid before it launches. Zone previews. Beta testers. Data mining etc.. Virtually everything is known about every expansion/patch prior to release. 
---
And keep in mind a lot of what people think they know about Classic is based on private server experiences, which is different than what Classic is. How different? We won't know until years from now. So come, participate in the madness, revel in a unique, historical gaming experience that many of us missed out on the first time!
---
Eh, i didn’t think to much about it. I was a junior in college when I started playing. Just knew you weren’t a teenager
---
I would absolutely take anyone who would put up with it. Shows they are dedicated and know what they are doing.
---
What was it?
---
Slots sounds like a promoted bank alt. 
---
Sometimes nostalgia is more than just nostalgia.
---
I’m looking at building my first pc but hard to justify because I bought a laptop not to long ago. Are there budget builds specifically for classic that will run the game better or just as good as fancy expensive PCs?
---
Can’t. Don’t want to play it until it’s re-released. A sound idea though!
---
Because all some people care about is winning.
---
Ah, I forgot they were turning layering off in P2.
---
GRERLOGOLOGOLOGOL
---
there is more junk on that table than ive consumed in my entire 37 years.
---
Why are you replying to a discussion piece of obvious factual information..... if you have a point make it clear please.
---
No, I believe it's for some Mercy outfit or some other Overwatch character.
---
Oh boy, does that mean we get to fuck with gold-farm bots again? Like kiting them into the Furbolg tunnel that needs rep to not be hostile.
---
I hope not since it does not comply with the naming rules
---
Grind the rep back in the other direction... though that’s insane.
---
The real questions :)
---
Paladins are pretty easy to level, it's mostly autoattacking. And I don't think Paladins were ever considered bad? They have great buffs, are excellent healers, and very hard to kill. But they are a support class, not a damage class. Keep that in mind, and you can do well with them :)
---
So many haters in the comments. I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed your meme and breathed a bit more heavily out of my nostrils than I normally would.
---
I thought they only recently added that into Retail.
---
No damn doubt about it.
---
Also, I like the downvoting on my comment, I was obviously just joking. Based 9 gang.
---
I did the same thing, couldn’t get the names I really wanted thanks to work anyway.
---
Best thing to do is first Download battlenet client then click wow then subs, you will get the retail game up to legion for that subscription and classic, all you have to do at this point is select classic.
---
mining with what
---
What race were you out of curiosity?
---
wtf, there HAS to be a more streamlined way of doing this
---
Double gathering when you can only track one type at the time?
---
Too bad they didn’t release WC3 before classic. Activision level planning.
---
I get that; but for me I picked up the battle chest a few weeks before WoW way back in 2005.  This is more for me doubling down on nostalgia and I hoped other people would enjoy it just the same.
---
Just dont read that post?
---
[yeah onya champ, on ya bike and fuck off](https://imgur.com/AQExJb0)
---
Of course it’s semantics or are you going to explain how connected and merge are entirely different in the context used in this forum and by blizzard as referring to classic?
---
That’s a good point?
---
Fuck man....... I laughed way to hard at this!
---
No, addons are completely unnecessary. Once you settle into the game you can decide what you might want.
---
/spit [target]
---
These are perceptions of the masses. It doesn't matter if they are right or wrong. When you have 30+ people in a guild ready to play and half the guild is vehemently opposed to playing on x server, it doesn't matter if they are right or wrong. If you want to play cooperatively with people you know, you do what the overall decision is.  
---
And again, people are seeking an authentic as possible experience. It's fair to want to stay away from the unknown.
---
If you have the old keys download it from bnet and run the launcher there are updates that run the videos properly.  This has been my experience at least.
---
I honestly expected it to be a bit higher then that. All in all I am sure people will do it.
---
I mean virtually nobody levels in an all out healing spec, but I never remember druids having any issue keeping tanks alive in 5man content one with actual points into their heals should do even better.  Most healing classes level in a dps spec and keep a bag of healing gear in the bank.
---
That guide was pretty good back in the day.  I followed it for my second max level char and it sped up leveling a lot.
---
thanks mate, I'll have a gander
---
Ya no doubt. That would have been a good lead in.
---
Spirit? I disagree 
---
I would say Agi—&gt;int—&gt;stam
---
Spirit is not even a factor
---
fair play, shows how much I know about the current state of retail haha. I'll get it sorted
---
So, spit in the face of everyone who picked a server? Cool.
---
No. If someone takes a shit in your favourite pub what do you do? Ignore it? No. You say something about it because shit belongs in the toilet. Just like this photo.
---
Correct
---
You are clear easily up until raiding with 0 points in prot, can get away with it after that but last stand is pretty nice.
---
Ana wisp made me briefly forget about classic wow. Briefly.
---
My motherboard died today, i hope i to change it in time :\
---
No way in hell would they be able to control shit on a server as popular (and Horde dominated) as Shazz.
---
&gt; Every single guild I've been in where DKP has been used people have massively exploited the system in multiple ways
---
&gt; None of the guilds I've been in that used Loot Council have had any issues with unfair loot distribution
---
Ok and how many guilds have you been in on vanilla servers exactly? There's good dkp guilds and bad lc guilds. My post isn't shitting on dkp, I'm just saying guilds advertising as casual and LC is usually a sign of drama to come.
---
Because he said "What is this 'Low' that you speak of, OP? On EU there are no 'Low' population servers left, regardless of language or **type**." which would include retail, which is why i said i don't think that's true.
---
I know what subreddit im in, you have to be able to comprehend what the other people said, he literally said ANY type and yes i know hes referring to pvp/pve/rp but that it could also include retail
---
Everything is a serious and personal attack on character on reddit in general. Treat people like they are really insecure and they will start to make more sense.
---
Wait, is that wrong for guilds to only care about their own progression and their own members?
---
Yeah it has to be organized in a way where youre all combined in an open way or its super messy
---
The world is MUCH larger in the current game than it was in classic. Far more room for people to be spread out. If you crammed all of a low pop server into orgrimmar it would look packed. That's a huge factor in why realms feel dead.
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
I’m just looking for some suggestions, so feel free to share as much of your knowledge earned from your testing and experiences!
---
The PC will only have to handle Classic, Discord and maybe Spotify. I got another rig for work (which I can’t upgrade) and a console for all other gaming. So the PC is purely for classic. I guess I can stick to my 4 gigs of ram then. 
---
I’m a total noob in terms of PCs and upgrading, I only know some basics (like the GPUs VRAM is kinda important for high resolutions) and I watched some gorgeous classic footage in 4k on my TV, it’s freaking gorgeous. Would you name a few more GPUs which I can look for on eBay? Is 2 gigs of VRAM enough for 4k, other things I might wanna look out for?
---
And again, thanks so much for your effort, really appreciated.
---
People need to stop with this one game to rule them all shit. Retail is a different game from classic, stop hoping that blizzard will ruin it to make it more like classic. You won’t be happy with the result and neither will retail players.
---
You can't reduce the chance for glancing blows, it's always a 40% chance. Weapon skill increases your dmg from glancing blows though, and when you reach cap your gb will deal 100% of normal dmg, while still not being able to crit.
---
Woah that's basically the same format as Echad Mi Yodea. Never knew. Wonder which came first or whether both were derived from a third song.
---
The amount of soda 🤢

You might’ve heard elemental precision isn’t that useful because on the beta I’m pretty sure your spells couldn’t be resisted by enemy players. In reality it’ll be the best talent you put points into

Here is the gear I had before the TBC announcement killed my guild and I ended up quitting. [https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/mage/human/AjwAAVNjAkl-A1NhBTdIBkrAB0ITCFfkCUuuClflC1rFDFLaDU3uDkuzD1npEFMZEk2V](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/mage/human/AjwAAVNjAkl-A1NhBTdIBkrAB0ITCFfkCUuuClflC1rFDFLaDU3uDkuzD1npEFMZEk2V) In classic i'd prioritize getting things like mana igniting cord, choker of the fire lord, Neltharion's tear and of course in phase 1 rush to get Robe of the Archmage they are fantastic. Loot from Rag or Nef can be hard to get (RNG Gods) but depending on how your raid guild does loot you'll have a ton of DKP over a mage collecting mage sets. Vanilla had a lot to do with gear planning so you really needed to discuss with your fellow mages on if X drops I want it. I can't predict how classic will go, but I think many guilds will do loot council or have each class discuss and vote on who gets what loot. I think DKP wont be as popular. I could be wrong though.  
---
Have fun on your mage! Me personally I'm going to heal this time. I'm still burned out from playing mage 15 years ago.

Chronormu is a Bronze Dragon in the form of a Gnome called Chromie. She was sent to Andorthal to investigate The Scourge's plan because they were messing with time. She was very sociable for a Dragon so she became the ambassador for the Bronze Dragonflight in Wyrmrest Temple. Now Blizzard is using her as an "excuse" to go back to Classic WoW (She invents a time travel thingy that reverses time and lets heroes go back to Classic times).
---
Server releases and server populations. All the reshuffling that seems to be happening due to the high demand
---
Worth noting that Joana has been updating his guide recently so it has improved even more since.
---
Just be original and your name won’t be taken. Or just pick any name because honestly nobody cares what your name is
---
Do you not know how to... turn off a monitor? Or open google or something? Like forreal?
---
I keep seeing the “tourist” excuse, but I’ve not seen one person say oh I’ll just check it out. No one resubbed to be a tourist. Everyone that name reserved is pretty hardcore. I just don’t get it. I seriously doubt we’ll see the drop off everyone is claiming.
---
Ah yes, I see you are a man who makes THIS comment as well
---
Seems to be fixed now btw, it was likely just a datamining error
---
Bro gotta add a decimal so people believe ya 76.32% of the time.
---
Any link for Fairbanks-US-PVP
---
It’s the most active dps rotation in classic.
---
Which one are you talking about? :) the website or Joanna's?
---
Anecdotally, I’ve talked to over 15 people who intend on playing in real life, and 10 of them are younger (17-23) and they are going to play because of the hype and the *real* gameplay. They will quit around 32 if not sooner. The older 5 people, with lives, jobs, families, etc, will play for a while, realize the time sink, and hit the nostalgia withdrawal by level 19 when they finish their first deadmines, wiping 3 times and the whole instance taking 3-4 hours. They will quit, too. 
---
Then there’s the few, like me, who have dabbled on private classic wow servers, have levelled to 60 more than once, and know exactly what we want. People like me (hopefully) will make it. The first 3 months will be amazing. Then BlackWingLayer will remind all PVE’rs how fucked WoW classic can be, as guilds decked out in easy MC gear get crushed by the first area and 2nd boss, over and over. Then more people will quit. 
---
In 5-6 months this game will be basically dead. Raid loggers. No arena pvp. Anyone who wanted grandmarshall pvp gear will have it. No one wants to level a 3rd 60. Core players will carry on, but the numbers will be 7-10% of starting players.
---
There's also 19/29/39 twinks
---
Are you trying to level as quick as possible.. I’m just going to explore and take it as it goes not sure what the big rush is. Content won’t run away you will be still running Mc and Ony in 2 years. My  advise take it slow have a adventure.
---
Who is gonna make devilsaur armor then?
---
WoW ruined all other MMO's for me. 
---
No newer one ever came close to peaking my interest. The only thing that I somewhat got into again was OSRS which is what I was playing prior to WoW
---
It's true, all you gotta do is look and see what the top scoring link on /r/wow of all time is. That should give you a pretty big indicator.
---
Enhance shaman was beautiful to watch in pvp if done well. One of my buddies grinded out the pvp rep for unstoppable force, and he did some bad things to a lot of terrible Alliance.
---
Europoor confirmed.
---
Well not like it matters anymore lol also taken on other servers already.
---
I was going to be Nambla the Priest
---
Warrior looking to grind level dungeons. Will be no lifing for a week or two, reducing work hours. Would love to join
---
Nowhere do they state they'll reduce the Active Player Realm Cap in Phase 2, you're simply guessing. That's my whole argument, they won't reduce the Active Player Realm Cap as it would cause "unsustainable issues" and that would be "forestalling the problem" in their own words
---
Jan Hegenberg is quite the known personality in Germany.
---
He basically started off making songs like these, and thanks to the internet, he became famous. He still makes music to this day, either gaming or humor-focused and it's all pretty cool stuff.
---
Props to Jan, awesome music. Trendy Eistee especially was him singing about his favorite brand of iced tea, no sponsorship in sight. It's random, but pretty funny - especially with how serious and at times, epic he tries to make his music.
---
Just fyi, as someone who played enhancement in vanilla and deeply regretted it, enhancement is 90% autoattacking while praying for windfury procs, because the only other things you do is use a shock every 6 seconds, stormstrike every 20 seconds, and put down some totems. It's only narrowly more interesting to play than a ret paladin, which literally just autoattacking and a judgement every 10 seconds.
---
&gt; They've said they plan to allow free transfers off of the overpopulated servers if not enough people leave them like they've done in the past.
---
Got a source for that? Legitimate question, my guild is debating hopping to another realm. The more info the better
---
If it makes you feel any better OP, there are only 223 hours left to wait, or 13,380 minutes!
---
&gt;My alts get to sit in Stormwind
---
This is classic. Put your alts in Ironforge!
---
Hope you got pocket heals.
---
They can't make more layers. You will still have 10k queues but with more layers, so you will play with layering until the end of phase 6. Just go to unpopulated server and stop ask for stupid things. Or play BfA, it has plenty of them.
---
&gt; Appreciate that. I hope one day we’ll get a genuinely stellar game who won’t get ruined by that vicious cycle, free of corporate bs. I could make a prayer of it at this point tho.
---
I have conceived this game. If I ever win the lottery or BTC is worth Trillions, I will personally fund it.   
---
Simply put it takes the Hytale, Skyrim approach to game development. Release a bare bones engine with a simple story, and provide a modding kit and servers for the community to develop.  
---
Over time certain servers and mods will rise to the top, and become the norm.  
---
Imagine an MMO with Classic game design, but with the entire world able to pic and choose which version/server/mods they wanna play.
---
The biggest difference for me is my entire mindset:
---
15 years ago I had never played an MMO before. I didn’t have any idea what I supposed to be doing. I didn’t know or understand what could be done in the game. 
---
Now, I’m a 15 year veteran. I have clear goals, and I know exactly what I want to do and how to do it.
---
I don’t see why you would be considering how massively popular it still is.
---
Sure. I never said otherwise.
---
Absolutely no one will be 60 in 2 days takes about 30% off 'er
---
I think people underestimate how many current wow subs made names but have no interest in playing, or play for a few days and go back to retail
---
When you really think about it, at its very core games create false inconveniences that we need to surmount. Why couldn't I just push a button and get a BIS set?
---
It's an extreme example, but it definitely supports that there's a balance between convenience and having a game.
---
Or alcohol. I've seen a lot of people mention their drinking
---
I get your point. But it'll be the same for Classic.
---
Raid tiers is literally the same, especially for Classic this time around, where the average player is much better. You spend months farming the same shit in launch raids, then the next tier releases and your old gear is literally irrelevant in most cases, because your guild is still going to farm MC and Onyxia, so anybody can jump in with their shitty gear and clear the raids. 
---
Raid tiers used to be a stepping stone to get unto the next tier, but lets be honest, for MC/BWL and even some part of AQ40 it won't be the case.
---
First link gg wp
---
If anything this makes me more worried about medium pop
---
i dont remember tier gear being tailored to fury, could be wrong tho
---
Where did he say anything about this?
---
My first thought aswell lol
---
Works with bing too =]
---
Its not worth the time, though with the high population this time maybe there will be more in circulation making it easy
---
You already know they’re gonna update classic...
---
Yiiikesss
---
There are already communities devoted to this. Xpoff.com is a good think source.
---
More like the 40k a month vs the parents house
---
I know people are going to hate this but whatever. I don't think retail will ever go away, but if Classic is stupid successful they may go onto add other legacy servers for other expansions. I also wouldn't mind a new expansion to build off of Classic and keep it the same gameplay with a totally new experience.
---
\&gt;inb4 ur dumb
---
Can we please fucking ban post on streamers.
---
Just wait. After few days of unsuccessful tries to log into a game they will rethink that.
---
I leveled a warrior back in the day and part of me wants to go relive that Human Warrior ""experience""
---
The other part of me doesn't want to hate my very existence and should go rogue or druid.
---
Also relevant for sex!
---
3 years with zero games and zero announcements is *very* strange. Obviously they're hard at work on something, but no teasers? No leaks? No hints? Very unusual.
---
How will layering affect STV?
---
The linework is awful, give me some of what you’re smoking
---
Mining/tailoring
---
find a readily available guide for leveling engineering. 
---
When you have mined all the mats you need, drop mining and level up engineering
---
Älgtårar ❤️❤️❤️
---
Pretty much covered by the folks below. It's about downtime, mostly. Rogue's are squishy as hell. Also, you need CDs to reliably take on multiple mobs, so it can be a little rocky in places with mobs that are strung together - and arguably the best CD for dealing with multiple mobs (blade flurry) is deep combat.
---
Ugh you're one of those people who inserts their political opinion onto video game subreddits
---
Let people do what they want.
---
Well i hope so im going to be playing both but first month classic only get to 60 start raiding.
---
From the sounds of it, yes. This is my worry too
---
Who is?
---
The hope is that population dies down a bit because tourists will have left by then, so removing layering wont be as horrible, I do see a spike in queues happening either way though
---
These threads are hilarious. Wanting Classic for the 'authentic' 2004 experience but too terrified to get ganked a few times.
---
Stalagg is doomed to being a shitty underpopulated server.
---
I like your idea better. I’ll have taco fixings, jambalaya, grilled chicken/steak/fish and rice. And lots of coffee and water. With some fruit juice tossed in at times.
---
But that makes the problem worse in Phase 2 when they get rid of layers.
---
Because 1.12 talents help.
---
1.12 quests as well.
---
We know because of the phases not all 1.12 quests will be there, like the content-gated ones. But throughout the Vanilla patches, a lot of quests were added and they'll be there at launch. That paired with 1.12 talents does make it A LOT faster. It's not uncommon to see 7+- days on average by the players on private servers with somewhat similar quests and talents.
---
Nothing in classic has as little downtime as a retail fury warrior, honestly.  It was more rpg and less fast paced action game.
---
I powerleveled a character in Vanilla. It was really stupid but having a 60 warlock without having to do shit was really nice.
---
it will be midnight for me, but i will work that day and come home in the evening, then play a few hours if the servers are up, before getting a good nights rest.
---
Then i have the following 5 days off, and have told my SO to go find other things to do and take the credit card with her while i lock my self in the office.
---
Now become warlord to avenge him!
---
I need to get to 60 ASAP because some of us have been playing private servers for years and we are sick of leveling at this point.
---
7-9 days played time is a long time when you have to work 40-50 hours a week.
---
2h Fury would be a nice addition.
---
Also I'd really like to see how these specs scale through the phases. Maybe some of them scale better than others and we might get some surprises. But I realize it might be too much to ask to compile such a massive amount of information.
---
If you're in the 5-10 area and see a lone lvl 8 opposite faction member it is some tempting bait.
---
It's pretty shit. AQ set is decent if you're super unlucky but only the shoulders are BiS.
---
It’s doable it’ll just be class quests that you each get that require you usually to go back to your factions city/zone. Same as when it comes time to get a mount
---
Hey Priestyboys! I'll invite you once I'm home from work. Dont worry, I wont be working after Classic WoW releases
---
It's definitely example 1, if it wasn't, then why would they have layering in the first place?
---
I'm pst, so I made a secondary priest on myzrael last night incase whitemane is too full launch day
---
savage
---
What on earth is this comment.
---
I get the joke, but I have to say as a combat vet, with medals, and who lost friends, the vietnam and jokes like this are the only jokes I get a little cringe about.   
---
Dont stop, but just know that war isnt always a joke to people.
---
False, some people like fun facts
---
I already know my professions, too. Tailor and Enchanter. Not sure if I will do a lot of raiding. I'm more a casual-y player. I'm probably wanting to see UBRS and LBRS. But who knows, maybe I'll manage to get dragged into some raid-fills.
---
Arathi is for sure awesome.
---
Guess I know what I’m doing this weekend!
---
They have said this:
---
&gt; Bonfire has not officially announced their first project. However in an interview with Morgan Webb at the VentureBeat Summit in April of 2019, Rob Pardo announced they were working with the Unity game engine on an online multiplayer game. He also announced some details of the project.
---
&gt; "Our first game is going to be a PC focused game. I think it might eventually go cross platform, but it's a PC game. It's definitely much more for a core audience, we're not going to suddenly go out and make Candy Crush."

It's ok :) he wasn't arrogant. The point is that unfortunately I won't have the same time to play as 15years ago, and I would like to keep up with my friends levels.
---
I know right, so good
---
Cool Overwatch comment. That game has its own sub, you know.
---
South Park references probably pretty popular with this community
---
I think you're the only person in this thread that made any connection like that. We have been talking about the CLASSIC servers in here nonstop for days.
---
Good to know man... now I’m going to take extreme precautions to not lose my name lol
---
With regards to classic, "days played" from /played command is why people talk about X days of playtime to level.
---
Blizz will end up releasing a Diablo MMO built on the Classic philosophy. Retail will go down the road its been going on further into clown world and Classic will stay Classic maybe popping up a fresh once a year.
---
So you're okay with giving account details and money to a sketchy third party site? But Blizzard providing a safer, faster, more secure and probably cheaper version is too much?
---
Nice Photoshop
---
Internal battle won't make it enjoyable. Decide and go. You don't have to all-in either.
---
Everyone should be weary of this as a rogue;
---
Your spot is easily replacable by a much more useful fury warrior whose gear you take and can off tank. If you don't game hard as a rogue you won't be brought to raids and you won't get loot because there's essentially no fight where it's required to have a rogue. If you suck at your class or are extremely undergeared, good luck.
---
Thats fair, I think we need a dedicated day to it so the sub doesn't get flooded. I think or hope that once the game launches that things will cool down. The sub will probably die a bit outside of developer news.
---
&gt;but its way more rewarding in classic
---
Anything that gets wiped before the 27th is not rewarding to me in anyway lol
---
Oh really? Maybe lock is my port of call then :s
---
Herod 4 life. *bro fist*
---
For me it was so much faster because I stopped questing and just went to grind out gear for 60.
---
15 hours of BRD later...
---
Just my opinion didn’t mean to offend my point is exactly what you said don’t feel pressured to rush to 60.  Do what you want
---
Wow what a classy guy, maybe use Google next time for such a frequently asked question, its 2019.
---
Wtf? Is this really how many mats u need to raid?
---
From the USA best buy or amazon. Just do the financing thing that doesnt have interest if paid off in 6 months.  Buying a cheap laptop though just for WoW is a waste of money. You should invest more so you could at least use it for other things.I got the helios predator I pay monthly for. You also gotta factor how much time you'll actually put into playing. If your just playing at home you can probably buy a used PC on craigslist that will play WoW on max settings. Let go, offee up. Plenty of cheaper methods to play WoW. I just looked in my area and found one for 150 bucks that would play it. Doesnt come with a monitor but that is like 50-100 bucks anyways.
---
Lmao like FFXIV is any good.

---
Enh is great in 1v1. You can actually DELETE people if you are lcuky with windfury procs.
---
I have young children so extra expenses like monitors don't really happen right now haha.
---
Just pay attention because there are quite a few quest chains where someone in a major city will send you to talk to X in another zone. Unlike retail where you always can start questing while reaching a new hub.
---
Nah  gotta level a rogue and camp the yeti cave...
---
I want to do that run.
---
I didn’t mean tier sets. I just read fury starts to really shine in AQ40 and late BWL. There are a lot of plate pieces that drop for fury
---
so respawns will not be camped in starting areas?
---
I meant the actual abilities not the talents
---
It might have been one of the Q&amp;As but it was something along the lines of changing retail due to the popularity of classic and wanting feedback.
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
Yeah I'd love an alliance version as well
---
&gt;For example, most would think 30 is the natural halfway point.
---
Maybe when wow launched? It's very common knowledge that levels increase in time to acquire these days. There are very few games that don't use that system.
---
I know but still 30 second window a week after name reservations opened
---
People have used the same name for 15 years not surprising they get attached.
---
I lost mine so just altered the ending though
---
I disagree, I think LFR did more damage and CRZ/sharding/phasing did more to hurt the community of the game, and in the end, that's a core aspect for my enjoyment.  
---
I don't care if people can instand queue into a dungeon while leveling or whatever. Heroics/mythics should still be group formed along with raids.  
---
I don't care that people can get into dungeons, but I don't think they should insta-group into "endgame" content.
---
Merged means you shut down server A and combine its population with server B.  That sends a message that the game does not have a sustainable population and servers are unnecessary.  It also raises a host of issues like what to do with names of players / guilds that are identical on A and B once they have merged.  
---
Connected Realms are the Blizzard solution to both these issues.  In a Connected Realm situation both realms remain open independently thus avoiding the stigma of closing a realm.  It also avoids the naming issues as XYZ-Medivh and XYZ-Thrall are shown when those players are addressed.  In a merged realm XYZ needs to be assigned to one of those players and the other would need a rename.  This is also true for guild names.
---
This is NOT a semantics issue.  Mergers and Connected Realms are inherently different answers to the same problem.
---
You dress your alts up in nice gear? I let mine suffer because they're slackers. Occasionally, some nice player feels sorry for my alt and opens up a trade to give them presents. :D
---
Lame Thex.
---
You are correct... but in addition to the longer term population, layering also has an ancillary effect of helping keep the started zones less jammed.
---
As a lover of classic and a lover of no man’s sky, this brings joy to me
---
Wow I really didn’t want that to end!
---
I liked farming with my mage in classic. I would do 2 pulls to clear dead mines. The AOE of mage was really nice for farming lowbie dungeons.
---
Cloth was a really consistent form of income. I would mainly farm lowbie dungeons for cloth, but you could sometimes get a BoE blue for big money.
---
Well then they would just have layering for the starting zones, or phasing even.
---
Don’t be an idiot like me and make the wrong class lol
---
Blizzards track record is to blame
---
Fury is by far the most engaging spec in Classic pve.
---
I'll be offering powerlevling services. Please put your social security number and credit card number with the 3 digit CVS on the back in a PM to me.
---
There's a completely different leveling meta on retail. Even if you take off your heirlooms, STV still won't be as highly-contested as we know it was.
---
You think they will have realm xfers to any server?
---
There's actually several spots where there's plenty of mobs with no quests associated. The gnolls unfortunately are not one of them though lol
---
Yeah those aren't in vanilla. Thorium headed arrows (which you traded for Thorium shells, in IF inn) are.
---
Thorium shells had to be made by engineers.
---
Spriests are well regarded as one of the best 1v1 in pvp.
---
!remindme in 10 days
---
Yeah I agree and I’m definitely looking forward to a little slower pace, just think retail fury is great and wanted to see how it matches up
---
I remember doing this in the burning crusade, except during TBC you could put those absolutely NUTS leg armor enchants on. I'd sit around in elwynn forest on a level 5 that was basically god.
---
For layering to be turned off, the server has to drop in population by a lot
---
Because it was released in patch 1.7
---
What happened to #nochanges?
---
I knew about BS increasing threat per person buffed, but didn't realize it only affected those in your party, I just thought it affected the raid in range. So the pets give 4 more bodies to generate threat?
---
Is it viable to lean towards spriest in endgame for pvp and to equip yourself you’re going heal for some time in raids?
---

---
rofl, it's literally a part of the game - hence PvP server.
---
Go play on PvE and stop crying.
---
A good ret today probably performs a lot better than many average dps of any other class back then. 
---
People forget how better players are today and how much easier mechanics were back then so I don’t think having a ret in your group would hurt in 2019 :)
---
Holy on the other hand is SUPER viable.
---
Just meet up after the starting zone, that's how I would do it. Huge pain in the ass to travel that far at lvl 1. Pretty sure you also fuck up your class quests doing that, although I've never done it, so I wouldn't know much about it.
---
Nobody hates MMOs more than /r/MMORPG 
---
Also, why is LSF on there? I know the OP did not make the list but it is hardly a gaming sub.
---
&gt;The game's always been pure RNG bullshit. Retail WOW is actually far more hardcore than vanilla ever was. +15 mythics with shitty affixes and mythic raiding are far more challenging than anything in vanilla. The only real difference between WOW then and WOW now is that they added tourist modes for all the content so basically everyone can "see" everything.
---
This is pretty true, and I think people are going to be in for a rude awakening when guilds are clearing BWL (tier 2 raid) with more than half the raid wearing mostly leveling blues.  Much of vanilla was easy, most of the difficulty was finding 39 other people who knew which buttons to push, until Naxx anyway.
---
Nah this is a troll name tbh. I got some others on Grob hehehehe
---
But I want to play WoW with 6 buttons, so I guess you'll have to die.
---
Only need 1 of us to get in at 6:00 to hold the whole group here.
---
Damn these games really did not age well did they?
---
You're somewhat right, Frost becomes worse as fire scales really well with Crit, but it certainly does not become better. Then there's also gear being Vanilla, so some people will get their gear faster than others. Also that one guy in your Raid who's bound to WC duty will be last of the mages, since the other guys go AP.
---
Furywarrior + Rogue&gt;Mage&gt;Warlock/Hunter. Those last 2 change a lot depending on the tier, and warlock slowly becomes as good as mage.
---
Also, gauging Firemage DPS is really tough because ignite isn't attributed to you but rather 1 Fire Mage who's then solely 1st on the DPS meters if you have 6-8 geared Firemages. Also scorch duty is a thing, similar to WC.
---
Doable? Yes.. but I can't imagine how the hell you will tag a single mob with that much latency.
---
Mark is an abusive megalomaniac who single-handedly tanked his own studio with stupid boondoggles and employee mistreatment, but go off I guess.
---
Stress test made me realize how much I missed playing a hunter in vanilla.
---
When the ef is reforged coming out?!
---
Have fun leveling rogue lol it’s super rough early on, honestly felt comparable to warrior for me for first 10 or 20 lvls. Gets way easier w more levels and gear tho ofc
---
Is this sarcasm? Because that thread is filled with almost nothing but praise
---
No you are correct IK Edit is the guy who got a gig at Blizz doing the pvp stuff. I feel like people mix these two together all the time. Somewhat understandable though I guess because both of them make some really cool stuff
---
Of course!
---
Couldn't nelves also ride it? I have faint memories that my brother (nelf druid) used one before they removed race restrictions.
---
I second duskwood
---
They said it's going to be used until phase 2 so that's MINIMUM 3 months
---
Badasses.
---
You can tank all 5-mans and ubrs as arms with no problems. Keep decent tanking gear and build some agro before dps starts mashing buttons and youll have zero problems
---
Yeah SWTOR doesn't have any low pop servers either, what are you talking about doode /s
---
You’re surrounded by idiots.
---
Which faction will they be rolling? I wanna spawn camp T&amp;E.
---
Nixxiom is cool he gets a pass even if he rolls the opposite faction.
---
I've just suggested. No offence. yet
---
Nice, this is useful. But there's also a second list of reserved names that can't be used, in addition to the profanity filter list. For example, "Metzen" is on the reserved names list. Might want to add that to your tool too.

It's rare for me to not want to enhance an experience with somekinda drug. Classic is the first time in a long time I'm looking forward to doing an activity for a long time completely sober.

Wait what part wasn't related to wow?

I enjoyed FF14 a lot and had a very social experience with a lot of players during my time there.  It was the only MMO I have ever played that had polish similar to a level of WoW.  It's also had it's share of attention, so it isn't like it's so non entity in terms of popular gaming culture, it has it's place.  I would even go as far to say if my choice was between FF14 and retail WoW I wouldn't even consider retail.  I totally get the appeal and why some people are still into that game, I believe their feelings come from a place of not wanting to see their friends leave the game for another.  
---
What I think they miss is that WoW classic is still a special game, and it basically rewrote the genre as we know it.  I don't see how you can fault anyone for wanting to tap into that or the unique set of circumstances this game offers.  You can't get a classic WoW experience in any other MMO right now, at least not for another 9 days.

Best in slot for my melee priest.  My staff will hit so hard!
---
not as crazy as in path of exile where lvl 1 to 98.5 is equal to 98.5-100 ^^
---
I played pally during vanilla and did heavy progression raiding (BWL, AQ40, Naxx). I never had cloth gear. Went from T1 to T2 (judgement)
---
I feel this. I used to play the original Warcraft RTS games with my mom, and when WoW came out we were both hooked. She passed in 2007 and I haven't played retail since our subscription ran out back then. I can't wait to go back

---
I think anyone who pays attention to game releases and populations realizes that even the most hype games have a pretty large drop-off *within* the first month.  
---
Now I wouldn't put a time frame on the drop-off, I do think a lot of people have rose-tinted glasses on how much of a chore leveling will be. It would not be surprised to see a pretty vast drop after a few weeks, but I doubt we'll ever find out specifics, just like we don't with retail anymore.
---
This is what makes older games different, there is no answer to this question. It depends on what you are doing, how many you are fighting, are you solo roaming, are you roaming with a small group, are you doing a BG as the dedicated flag runner.
---
Yeah it never captured the sheer enjoyment that WoW gave me.
---
Layering will be turned off whether the pop drops or not.
---
"good" items still are no match for best items, and most importantly, enchants. High level enchants on low level gear is what makes twinks so busted. Bet a white geared enchanted "twink" would have more of an advantage over blue geared no enchants "twink".
---
im confused, there are 9 days till classic? Why make a 4 day meme?
---
This right here.
---
Blizz might have been wrong in many ways, but they're going to be right about "you think you do, but you don't", statistically, for a lot of people. Majority will quit pre-60.
---
That said, why is that a bad thing? You play for 1-2 months, have fun, Blizz perhaps got some subs they wouldnt have otherwise had. No big issue. Then the people who really do want this will obviously still be around to enjoy it.
---
Actually leveling a priest is easy as hell since you have no downtime.
---
That is some dumb fucking logic right there haha.
---
Nah classic wow is way more chill than bfa. There is no rush to hit 60. Take your time, level professions, make friends. In bfa the only content that most care about is locked to the bfa expansion. The old world is dead af and if you want to experience content you will have to do it solo.
---
The guys who quit wow cause they didnt hit 60 in a month are the press button get reward type player. Those people do not want MMOs, which is what classic is.
---
Classic experience is to avoid BGs until 60, really.
---

Does anyone know how much time it took to get to max lvl in Everquest 1, and how much time to get all AA maxed out once they came out?
---
I remember people playing for like a year and still not being 50 in vanilla Everquest 1. And those were the players who'd play for like 10h/day.
---
Dont expect to find int plate until lvl 56+. In vanilla, and this goes for shamans and druids too and even fury warriors, you should expect to down rank your armor class as you level in order to get what you need. No need to worry since I think it was cata or wrath that brought bonuses if you had full armor sets on. Vanilla is all like "cloth has strength and plate has spirit, wear what you want."
---
I like reasonable discussion on Reddit. Nice to see these last two comments!

This is why Im starting later. Also im too cheap to start subscription again just for a few days.
---
The "lying about that" people always were a small minority.
---
We could go round and round like this forever.
---
Duskwood for sure. Also since I'm leveling a Paladin it'll be nice for exorcism. Ashenvale is a close second though!
---
True, I think the cap is ~50 gold. If that is the case then even just once a week will be expensive.
---
They won’t have 8x people they will remove layering and have extreme queues.
---
Some of the big private servers like Nost, having the big pop was a great thing. Every zone always had people in it. No matter what you were doing, there was another couple of players there doing the same thing.  
---
It really depends on what you consider overcrowded. Like if you want to be able to do that outdoor dungeon without anyone else doing it at the same time, you won't like a big pop. For instance, the troll city in Hinterlands with all the elites. 
---
The biggest problem with big pop is the respawns or both mobs and resources. Long lines to kill quest mobs or gather items are not fun. Not being able to make any money or consumables because you can't pick flowers is not fun. Not being able to buy mats because they're all way too expensive because the supply is low is not fun.  These things were fixed on private servers by creating a faster respawn system. 
---
What is really fun about a big pop?  Being able to find a group for literally anything at any time of day or night. Want to run UBRS at 3am on Sunday morning?  You'll have a group in 10 minutes. Battlegrounds were always popping 24/7. 3 or 4 Onyxia pugs forming per day. Raid pugs forming all the time for MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ20 so you could go with your alts or if you missed your guild raid that week.

Yep. I bet you some of those posts are going to be from people who have overhyped this game.
---
You think logic and reasoning will work on neckbeards? They want the #1 server or RIOT, QUEUES FOR ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLll
---
Early summons were so OP though, roll a muse and go for phantom blade + summon mastery and you could pretty much solo anything up to 60-70 in a couple of hits. Then advance to Cleric, go bonfire and be wanted for every farm group!
---
I get the point you're going for, but you're kind of flippantly dismissing any and all world pvp that happens after BGs. I'm curious what leads you to this conclusion? I spent a lot of time wpvping in vanilla and TBC. TBC basically set up a framework in each region for world pvp to occur if players felt like it, which they often did on my servers.
---
Nagrand was honestly pretty legendary for world pvp, Ele shamans coming out of the air to absolutely blow you up.
---
In vanilla, EPL, WPL, Arathi, STV, Tanaris, the barrens, ashenvale... world pvp was happening all the time in various sizes. Were most rank-focused pvpers in BGs? Yeah, of course. But the point of wpvp wasn't usually to get rank/honor, it was to sow chaos and have fun.
---
Naw they will release another server and even that one will be good.  The only doomed servers are the ones after that.
---
Not 100% sure. Maybe the change in retail was to make it possible to change factions after the Cataclysm revamp. Maybe Cataclysm made it not possible.
---
Hey kids! Do you like hand cramps? Does carpletunel disease sound fun? If so FURY WARRIOR is just for you!
---
Retail is no perfect by any means but it's honestly not about short-term excitement. If anything, retail is about rng based repeatability and with that I could argue it's more long term than classic.
---
Having to reference every single quest you pickup with what is stated on the screen is insanely time consuming when you consider that you will be doing hundreds upon hundreds of quests.

What’s wrong with making my troll have a chiseled jaw and belong to the North American Marlon Brando Lookalike Association?
---
Is this canon in BFA, with actual npc dialog or just something blizzard said to RP the transition?
---
Be aware that there are a few quests that are mutually exclusive, so unfortunately you can't complete everything. Examples would be:
---
Little Pamela vs. Sister Pamela (different breadcrumbs for the same quest)
---
Get the Goblins Drunk vs. Get the Gnomes Drunk (two different options, same result)
---
There are also several optional breadcrumb quests that will be closed off if you complete the next stage first, so try to keep track of them if possible.
---
I would recommend looking through the quests per zone on classicdb to make sure you don't miss any.
---
Your anecdotal experience is just that, anecdotal. Figure it out.
---
After reading these comment I have come to the scientific conclusion that launch will be a shitshow.
---
this is why vanilla is so good.  there is no pvp bis because you have multiple goals you want to accomplish and you can't accomplish them all at 100%.  that said you want A LOT of int.  mana is a huge limiter for druids in pve and pve and hotw doesn't have natural shapeshifter.    it's up to you what you want to sacrifice.
---
They're funded by Riot though, there goes my optimism, Blizzard might be bad, bur they're quite far from Riot bad still.
---
1) They said before phase 2, which includes any time up until phase 2. 
---
2) They have previously said 2-4 weeks, which falls into the before phase 2 category.
---
3) Phase 2 has ALWAYS been stated to be 2 months after launch.
---
Please stop trying to get upvotes by scaring people.
---
In vanilla, everyone sat in IF between the bank and AH. This was because originally the only AH for the alliance was in IF. Later, when SW and Darn AHs were added, people were already accustomed to “living” in IF, so SW was usually mostly a ghost town. It wasn’t until the expansions came out that everyone moved to SW.

Nah Nostalgia definitely gets used as a pejorative for other things too.

The thing is he's not ***wrong*** it's just the words he chose were really bad in the context. 
---
Those developers are seeing the game differently than you guys are. 
---
Spamming trade for groups is incredibly inefficient and time consuming. 
---
Trying to get groups for "older content" is incredibly difficult to do if your only means of contacting people is chat in the hopes that someone is on at the same time you are, and wants to do the same thing you want to do. 
---
When Classic launches, you guys won't see this problem.
---
It will become a problem when most players are at level 60 and not making alts anymore. Doing low level dungeons, or elite quests will become difficult to do. 
---
This will be compounded if they decide to release an expansion, like TBC. Most players will be leveling their mains and not making alts anymore. 
---
This is exactly the reason they introduced the dungeon finder tech. Because players were just not doing old content because it couldn't be done. 
---
Classic will perhaps give some insight into player behavior that Blizzard can use, but it will likewise reinforce design choices that they have made along the way as being positive.
---

Thank you for these, a guy in my guild really wants to play Enhancement and sending him your enhance guide solidified his choice. Great stuff!

I've just learned two new words.

I think it was cause of the layering, something I predicted a while ago.

Most people create new toons and abandon them early on. This means new layers will be created to accommodate toons that never level beyond 10. This will create ghost towns for anyone who decides to continue leveling.

Hunter is not going to be an overplayed class at 60. A large number of newer players will pick it...and never get to max level. Of the hunters who do get to max level, there will decent hunters and there will be huntards that most people avoid. All you have to do to be decent is know how to manually control your pet, make sure you're not running out of arrows mid-dungeon, and don't accidentally pull with multishot or by not dismissing your pet when you jump. Seriously, don't worry about damage falling off. It really only happens heavily in Naxx, which not that many people will end up raiding most likely, and even then guilds will still need to take hunters. And it's important to note, that while your dps will not increase as much as the other straight damage classes, you will be a god in pvp. Your damage still increases, and you'll be able to burst someone wearing cloth with 3.5k crit aimed shots combo'd with a 2k multishot. 
---
Totally understand the deadzone concerns, it's something you have to keep in mind and try to play around, but that's part of being a good hunter. It's not going to be a problem against melee, and most ranged classes can't really take advantage of it. Casters need to stand and cast to do any real damage, and they lack the mobility to actually get inside your deadzone. The one class that can really take advantage of it is going to be a mage, since they have roots and blink. But really? 1-2 mages out of 10 are even going to be good enough to try and take advantage of that, and there are ways to play around it. If a mage gets into your deadzone and starts casting, use intimidate from your pet to stun him and force him to either wait it out while you get out of the deadzone and start kiting, or force him to blink out of your deadzone. If you get the jump on a mage, it's even less of a problem. Open with a 41 yard range attack, aimed shot or viper sting or both, and start kiting while damaging him. You have concussive to daze him, so even if he blinks towards you he's going to be ~15-20 yards away. He'll never have a chance to get in your deadzone. The other class that's a problem is druid, huge mobility, can shift to break slows, can heal, and has dots to whittle you down. But you have counter play against them as well in the form of scare beast and viper sting. If you master your class you can go toe-to-toe with anyone and have a greater than average chance of winning. 
---
Like I said before, I was torn between lock and hunter, and I really think you'll love whichever one you end up choosing. I personally went for hunter because I think it will be a lot more fun flavor-wise, I love the idea of using traps in both pve and pvp. I think hunter pets are more fun than warlock pets, even though neither of them are particularly good beyond the first tier of max level since they don't benefit from gear. I think hunter is much harder to play well in both pvp and pve, which means it will be more rewarding when you do play it well. Warlock...kind of feels too easy honestly. It's so strong, but I think I'd end up getting bored. What's the pve rotation? Keep dot up, spam shadowbolt? And in pvp, just fear people and dot them up while being nearly un-killable. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that hunter was the class to main because there's so much to it. People will know who good hunters are and they won't have an issue finding groups. 
---
As you can imagine, I've thought about this a ton on and off over the past year and a half. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns, happy to keep talking about it. It helps kill the wait. So close!

Boar is the best pet until 32, when you can tame a cat that knows Dash. Boars have charge early on which makes them get to your target 1-2 seconds faster on every kill. That 1-2 seconds on every kill really adds up quick and allows you to start bursting the mob sooner.

I've tried out a lot of the classes over the years, and I still feel like warlock is the one class where you always have tools to mess around with almost regardless of the situation.  
---
Pros;
---
* Fast and efficient levelers thanks to being a pet class
---
* Gets a free mount at lvl 40 which will save you some gold
---
* Soulstone and Healthstone gives you some extra comfort
---
* Very tanky for a clothie
---
* Great at grinding certain dungeons and elites for gold
---
* One of the main PvE specs, SM/Ruin, is also extremely good for PvP and general use so not much gold spent on respeccing
---
* Starts to scale real hard come BWL/AQ gear and ends up being one of the top DPS
---
* Absolutely monstrous in PvP when you've gotten comfortable with 'em
---
* Great control and CC
---
* IMMENSE amount of small tricks and spells you can utilize thanks to curses, spellstones, pet utility etc.
---
* Pretty stupid burst once you scale your spellpower up a bit, ends up having the highest consistent burst damage on a fight to fight basis in PvP
---
* Lots of cool questlines for getting your pets and later your mounts
---
* Tier sets look dope as hell, granted very subjective but Nemesis raiment blew my mind when I first saw it.
---
* High skill floor and immensely high skill ceiling, meaning you can be quite a decent warlock from the get go but you always have something to work on and learn.
---
Cons;
---
* Soulshard farming. I personally never felt like it was annoying since you just use Drain Soul on every mob you come across and you'll always be swimming in them, but some people find them annoying.
---
* Low hit rating early on in raiding thanks to lack of hit rating in talents, gets a LOT better with ZG crafted gear namely the Bloodvine set, so you start out a bit lower but grow in power a lot more than most classes.
---
* PvE rotation is the same as frost mage basically, you spam Shadowbolt, refresh your curse and use Corruption.
---
* Doesn't have much mobility, but is weighed up by tankiness and tools.  
---
Honestly there aren't many objective drawbacks to being a warlock, especially since we're starting on a 1.12 client where their talents had already gotten fixed in previous patches.  
---
It's a solid choice if you want a fantastic all-around class that you can do whatever you feel like with, even solo gameplay like farming and WPvP.  
---
I might have forgotten something, but I think I've summed it up decently well.
---
use locks to summon locks until the server crashes from infinite locks
---
Went looking for haters, was disappointed.
---
So much truth in this for me. There were a few that I enjoyed. Specifically AcheAge and Warhammer. Both of those games had some of the best pvp scenarios I've ever been in, but so so so much in everything else in them felt off. I always compared it to WoW and it always fell short, even if I enjoyed it, played it, and had fun.
---
This is why I'm going bear. 5 mans were my fav part of vanilla (never made it to 60 though so never got to raid) and I want to be able to run them without having to wait too long.
---
Try not to sing-read this. I dare you.
---
By forming connections and an us vs everyone attitude, guessing tho.

Thanks for the explanation!
---
It's not wrong, it's fact that some people will form an opinion at a game's release and then never change it. It's true that the game has vastly improved since release. That doesn't mean that everyone will like it, but it seems a bit silly for someone to call it garbage instead of just saying it's not their kind of game.

You can not buy this game anymore, have to wait for reforged lol.
---
You don't have to buy anything but a sub.
---
U cant
---
A lot of things should be implemented in wow classic. There are a TON of good quality of life updates they made to the game that I hope they bring to wow classic. The graphical update for example would be great. People are going to get into the game, play for a little nostalgia and then a lot of people are going to leave because it looks dated to hell.
---
Damnit. This actually made me chuckle.
---
I used to play Magtheridon, and remember the queues after Nihilum got world first on Onyxia. Not gonna lie that's when I went and discovered RP servers.
---
Transferred off.

To even things out as much as possible

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/crntcv/i_sincerely_hope_that_classic_wow_kills_retail_i/). 
---
Not really.  Was just joking.
---
I agree with Mark Kern. Large scale capitalism ruins everything.
---
Damn sweaty basement dwellers.
---
Actually, that was primarily acting. What really happened is that he saw it was trending on streaming sites, wanted to get in on the action, and so started pretending that he really liked it so he could cash in on beta streaming views. 
---
He still doesn't actually think it's sustainable.
---
Literally the top post there is hype for classic.
---
The only thing I can say to such an insightful and pertinent comment is:  
---
Yeah it is.
---
Yup. Most of my friends refused to play mmo
---
Shitty comparison, it's more like I make people go watch the ads for movies and call me when the movie starts. Some people don't like leveling, especially when you already have a max lvl char.
---
I think the cap is 50 gold and that’s a HUGE deal in classic. Very prohibitive to switch constantly
---
Raiding IF as Horde was always the scariest main city

wow classic girls should be old model tbh

26th for Americans :P
---
I do want to PvP yes. But considering that i've got shadowmeld on Nelfs which can be good on defensive bg's i believe? But I think 95% of the fighting is gonna happen out of stealth. So I think Dwarf is better in that case. It's just my theory on this. Thx :D
---
Dwarf for pvp and pve, Night elf if you wanna feel like a 13 year old again.
---
Unique just means 1 in inventory, Unique-equipped means only one can be equipped, if I recall correctly.
---
Cant wait to play Ret paladin in BGs at work

be a main tank, warlocks have the best threat in the game

_Somebody’s_ getting laid in Classic WoW
---
RPing isn't only heavy RP. Lots of people just enjoy having less trump/streamer/sports talk shitting up chat
---
I know the level scaling gets a lot of hate, but I'm actually enjoying it. Since you level so fast in retail, it's actually nice to be able to complete all the quests in a zone. Just like you, I honestly hadn't experienced the revamped zones too much.
---
The problem isn't the message being conveyed, it's *how* it's conveyed. And it's conveyed in the most obnoxiously pretentious and condescending fashion possible. That *is* the messenger's fault.
---
Druids tend to be the least played.  Shamans and Paladins are fairly low too, but I think that’s primarily because only 1/2 the population has access to either one.
---
Bye dunce. I just can’t comprehend how someone can be this dumb.
---
"Can" as in "physically able to enter the instance?" Sure. But no group is going to take a sub-60 player to any of those instances unless it's a guild run or they're desperate for someone of your class.
---
Sorry to burst people's bubbles but it's best to set realistic expectations.
---
You just have bad reading conprehension. You're completely ignoring the
---
&gt;any further
---
Qualifier in the post
---
I think that's a reasonable conclusion to make. The fist character I leveled to 60 was a dwarf hunter so I hope you like it as much as I did.
---
I've known enough people who can't admit to their mistakes to believe it's worthy of acknowledgement.  Hell, I've been the person who's too stubborn to admit I'm wrong.  
---
No one's saying we need to bow down before him, it's just an acknowledgement that he's mature enough to see he was wrong.
---
omg i cant wait i honestly missed this
---
Due to Ruin bringing your spell crits to a 200% modifier instead of 150% for every other spellcaster, aswell as the inherent threat modifier on Shadowbolt, you will eventually pull aggro.  
---
But, the more experience you get, the better you get at managing it. If you somehow get close to pulling threat, stop casting for a bit.
---
The video forgot to mention how much time it took to actually find the damn entrance to the dungeon once you got underground.
---
May I ask how you did two pulls? That’s a really cool and fun sounding idea!
---
Bank alts must be wearing a tuxedo. It is the law.
---
I love vanilla WoW, and I want to play classic, but I'm playing ff14 also and having a ton of fun playing it, why can't there be both? I don't want classic to fail, but ff14 ARR is arguably the best MMO to come out since vanilla WoW, the numbers don't really lie, it's the second biggest paid sub MMO on the market and the quality shows.
---
explain
---
That's fine.  Stick to Herod.  Tell me how the queues are on launch day.
---
I was going to ask this myself, since it’s classic do we have to download them the old way with unzipping like you mentioned, or can you use a client to download the addons?
---
Also have one of the best threat mangemets in the game
---
This was incredibly well done
---
This is exactly what I wanted, thanks alot!
---
GET GROBBED
---
Sick burn dude, it's gonna take him half an hour to recover because of the recently bandaged debuff
---
Yeah I like how the fact that druids can't kill each other has turned into "we have a special code of honor".  It'd be like saying 2 kids fighting with q tips have honor for not killing each other.
---
Oh Joana, my childhoods most iconic wow character. I just loved watching his guide over and over again. Even made a troll female hunter myself with that ponytail hairstyle. Thanks my dude hope you've earned a little pocket change back when you were selling your guide
---
I wonder if we'll see a return of the level 1 gold farmers dropping from the sky and dying to spell out gold selling websites with their corpses. Weird times.
---
You get to be just as excited over a new high dps wand! Very impactful. And you get staves and maces for stat sticks still.
---
40 FOOD AND WATER PLOX
---
PLS GIB GOLD???
---
F-in right doggie. Thats a big W ferda.
---
XIV and WoW have some audience overlap but if you think Retail WoW or XIV are going to die off from Classic I don't think you're right at all.
---
Personally I think Classic and XIV are both great for pretty much entirely different reasons and am going to play both. This isn't console wars, people can like things for different reasons, or both at once.
---
I think Medium is the best place a server could be at before launch.  It will fill up with out a doubt and hopefully not get so crazy you get massive queues.  Praying Fairbanks stays at high pop and doesnt breach full before launch
---
Layering is a "problem" that solves itself when the issue it is mitigating goes away. As people quit, the number of layers reduces. 
---
The hard cap of "Before phase 2" means the day they say "Alright, layers are off and queues are on."
---
{UnethicalLifeTips}
---
Always invite your one friend who can dps harder  than you. 
---
Position yourself on the other side of the boss.
---
It's decent. Not great, but not terrible either. It's passable
---
I am curious if they’ll add the store mounts to classic, and the tokens. I hope not but I do t have much faith.
---
I never said i was on herod....
---
Shauna...it's my name in real life so I thought it'd be fun...not anything super exciting, but fun

No worries my dude!

Leveling as Fury is fine. The big thing you lose is a lot of the Rage generation/maintenance talents in the Arms tree. These talents allow you to very easily tank Dungeons as Arms while leveling up. You can still do it as Fury, but it's not as easy at low-mid levels. 
---
One of the main reasons Arms is recommended for leveling is because it's the preferred PVP spec. So if you are on a PVP server, it's easy to flip the switch from leveling to PVP.
---
Endgame PVE wise, I believe you go DW Fury right away, but don't quote me on that.
---
Out of curiosity why would you farm clams?
---
If it's a consistent and significant problem, spec MD/Ruin. 20% less threat with the imp, but you lose the 10/15% damage from succ.
---
He's also the "shut up pvp guy" guy.
---
You were really reaching there eh lol
---
Can someone post where these numbers came from? I want to make my own in a different color and fill it it as I level up
---
Imagine Odysseus coming back decades after the Trojan war. The indescribable joy he must've felt finally coming home after the grave and impossible challenges he faced on his way back. That's what you're feeling right now.
---
^((minus the whole wife cheating on him part))
---
Also playing Underlords! It's a great game and really satisfying especially when you beat that last opponent who went 6 knights.
---
that doesn't prove they will reduce caps in phase 2 jackass
---
It's worth noting that leeway works on arcane explosion and with cone of cold you don't have to aoe farm with blizzard in classic.
---
I have a firm rule of no microtransactions. Which rules out 99% of MMOs.
---
You guys barely exchanged any actually information at all. If you are mad be mad but calling some one incomprehensibly dumb because you disagree with them is...super weird. You don't know enough to even comment on it, and you are saying you can't even comprehend the scope of what you know so far?
---
Says a lot more about you. Either way, 10/10 maximum pathetic, would read and laugh at again.
---
You say that but I know at-least three different friend groups, where none of them are current WoW players and all of them are coming back to play Classic WoW. It's a total of 19 people, and they wouldn't be the least bit interested in retail WoW.
---
Obviously this is a bit anecdotal, but I think that while there's a bit of an overlap, the audience for Classic is entirely different than retail.
---
My prediction is that Classic will be wildly popular at launch, more-so than retail, that'll last about 2-3 months, then the game will sustain popularity enough for Blizz to consider Classic+, but it will be maybe 70/60% of retail players.
---
Still a huge player-base, still worth catering to, but nothing crazy.
---
Oh there's anything the "anti-layer" people are going to clasp to and try to make their argument. 
---
I think layers at release will be fine.  It's going to help lower the queues, but not eliminate them.  People will be able to log into the game, still "make memories" and friend people they see.
---
Thanks will try it now ! Do you have beta access to try it?
---
I have 3 friends going in but I don't have much faith in them playing that much. So for the most part I'll be leveling solo
---
Why do u want to play a 2004 game in 4k.
---
Such nonsense
---
We did it boys.
---
When layering turns off, you will just get dumped in a queue. At no point will Herod be any more populated than a normal vanilla server.
---
I have been in need of an MMO since 2008 :( I fortunately found solace in ARPGs with POE but it's still not the full experience for me tbh (and sure as shit D3 doesn't live up to it's predecessor)... I've been waiting for something to geek out about for years and now we're sooo dammmm cloosseeee!!! \*victory screech\*
---
Atlas map
---
Gole*
---
This is not correct
---
\&gt;small quiet community
---
maybe in 2 years, they confirmed yesterday even medium servers are way more popular than the busiest servers in 06
---
Yep, layering turns off and queue goes on.
---
Sort of, we know that Medium means &gt;30,000 accounts.  Which means low is obviously &lt;30,000 accounts.  The unknown is what is the spread between Medium, High, and Full as of this point.  I highly doubt we get that information though.
---
We know Medium is &gt;30,000 because the biggest vanilla server had 29,000 accounts in 2006, since they stated it's bigger than that at medium in today's measure.  
---
Unfortunately, this is the only truly confirmed level of population we have to work with at this time.  Beyond that, we can only use other information to formulate estimates.
---
I believe the people who have all the server data and prediction data from 15 years of running an MMO over a guy on reddit who tells me otherwise.
---
I'm super excited about classic but I think having some healthy skeptism towards blizzard is warranted, given their history
---
Lmao get off his dick you pathetic dunce.
---
But it doesn't tell you anything other than what is already known beforehand: each level requires more xp than the last....
---
It is literally a pointless chart.
---
I see, thank you for your answer. I thought it was a rule for casters to always be casting, so that's incorrect?
---
It's just strange to me how all these guides have very in depth rotations on how to eke out every last bit of damage, for example right before a mob dies with insant casts and whatnot, but nothing for when you're close to pulling aggro.
---
It's just more efficient to stop casting and wait until you can do big dick damage again, then?
---
I am totally going activebolt rotation mage!
---
❤️
---
Heh reminds me of how I feel about planet Earth. Stop having so many goddamn babies, people!
---
Ah you must be new to 2019. You can react to anything these days, real or fake.
---
Jokes on you, I’m playing on PVE lol
---
They literally said they're just going to dump you in a massive queue if you still choose to play on Herod despite them making it clear that it is massively overpopulated.
---
I honestly wouldn't log into bfa even if I was paid to do so. Much rather play different games while I wait.
---
It was funnier, agreed! but this seems to flow a bit better
---
ArkInventory does it better imo. All the custom rules and areas to place stuff makes it great.
---
Then you wouldnt be able to call it classic anymore
---
Yes because 2500 at PEAK, 1200~ each faction assuming balance, minus townsitters, dungeon spammers, guilds required raiding and BGs equals such a populated world for "plenty" of world pvp. 
---
Further evidence is that your server Destromath is not even an original server..... as was designated low population for a majority of vanilla.
---
I just choose not to believe you and your lack of perspective and memory. Nothing more nothing less.
---
You don't want to know... trust me!
---
Yes it does. I had a diff ranks of a couple diff spells when I was doing stress test. :)
---
Indeed. I wonder if that factors in getting raped in PvP while leveling and the powerleveler rage quitting a few times a day?
---
I hope it doesn't come to that, because it seems kind of boring... Thanks for the tip!
---
Thank you for sharing this. I hope returning to Classic brings you more solace and happy memories than sadness. I wish you well!
---
Never smoked when I played WoW got bored of being high all the time well before classic release. I feel like it'd be pretty good at getting you through the grind. Definitely tempted to pick some up for classic
---
Dota Underlords. Been a ton of fun I’ve already sunk 100+ hours in
---
I know! I'm still so torn between druid and hunter.. probably role druid but I LOVE the old hunter system, the loyalty and feeding the pet, ammo.. It just made sense!
---
Anything to help pass the time until Classic's release. 221 hours to go!
---
Going solo for first 3 days of launch. Going hard and nobody is going to hold me back. I told my wife after those 3 days I’ll dis it back a bit and she can start a character we can play together. If she wants to play at launch she’s gotta keep up.
---
He may not be logging in, but he'll be with you the entire time.
---
Im preferring to use the blizz #'s than online polls. It might shock you to learn that women who game avoid online gaming communities because they tend to be exclusionary. This post totally isnt an example.
---
Get wallpaper engine and use the classic wow one. You're welcome
---
Skinning +
---
Everyone is in it for the long haul until they realize their server has a 4 hour queue every single time you want to play.
---
4K is still pretty demanding evening with classics dope graphics. The game is quite cpu intensive especially when large groups of people are around.
---
That’s so ironic to me considering FFXIV wasn’t really successful until it relaunched.
---
The server cap is higher now.
---
I was walking around downtown with my brand new camouflage jacket when a guy in a wheel chair rolled up to me and stole the jacket. As he wheeled away, I yelled, "you can hide, but you can't run!!!".
---
There's one hanging out in Sun Rock Retreat, and a few others.
---
I think I farmed dungeons from 10-80 on my warrior in cata with a group of heirloom friends because we just steam rolled everything
---
There's the Gelkis and Magram quests in Desolace.
---
You can pretty easily do the quest chain from one of the factions. But in order to do the chain for the other you're gonna have to spend hours murdering the faction you're friendly with so you can fix your rep with the other.
---
Same kinda deal with Bloodsail questline. You'll have to make yourself Hated with all the Goblin factions to do their quests (which is fairly limiting since you lose vendors, neutral AH, and quest hubs). The only way to fix it without losing your Bloodsail rep is to run DM:N and do the Ogre Suit turn-in a bunch of times.
---
I remember doing that at some point. I had bags and bags full of Ogre Suits I couldn't get rid of.
---
How much will char transfer cost if I realize I chose the wrong server? Will it even be available in classic?
---
I will be and already got it all set up and ready to go for live. Just will have to update it prior to launch, but that’ll be easy and my profile and config stays in tact.
---
Farm gold for wow tokens to get more game time for when classic arrives
---
Yeah people have different values for sure, personally I don't give a shit about the look of my character either. If cosmetics was important for me I'd play Fortnite and all the other micro-transaction shit games that are out there. I play WoW entirely for gameplay :)
---
I did. 90% of the game was at max level.
---
I don't really see how this is possible. The past two MMOs I have played were both classic renditions. Project 1999 for 7 years or so and EQs official classic server until final burn out. I consider them separate because Agnarr had modern QOL features and a RM shop for convenient items and community created skins. I probably spent at least $250 over the course of my time there. It was nostalgia meets modern comfort, which was fantastic after P99 and raid loot management.
---
Point is, I've made friends with entire communities of people who are reliable, return customers to classic games. That have virtually no interest in most modern MMOs. I feel like it's a solid business's model to run this server until completion.
---
WoW had, I think still the largest or fastest growing sub number of any mmo, during the early days.
---
I want to use ElvUI because of all the features that it includes. Just hoping someone develops a blizzard looking theme for it so I can still get the authentic feel of Classic.
---
I understand your concern's but since this is a classic warcraft community hub i don't see why anyone should or should not post something related to this community or this game. 
---
I know we are not the same, we think differently and value different things. 
---
For example I don't really want to see the same memes and questions either, so I filter them through my own perception, because I understand that things flow fastly around here and some people may not heard of something and they make a post and for someone who regularly checks the news it is tiring.
---
But as this is a huge community it is inevitable to get bothered sometimes.
---
where did they say this?
---
Except that many dungeons were gutted out. SM is totally different, Sunken Temple was castrated, Wailing Caverns is now pathetic. I think BRD survived the culling as did LBRS and those are two of the most confusing zones, so those could be worth a trip.
---
20 days?  Are these casual "power" levelers? The fuck?  Should be 1 week at most.
---
Retard
---
As far as I'm concerned, it's been a meme since it started. Far less people are going to "die out" than the people saying "tourists" think.
---
Wallpaper engine.
---
I would add that a couple % of spellhit can do wonders, else this is similar to how I prioritize my stats.
---
I managed to get almost all possible addons I wanted starting with a custom UI cause we all know Blizzard's default UI sucks... However I was able to setup everything nicely except for: Auctions, threat meters and damage meters. I know I can find these if I look deeper but..... I really want to be able to keep it all under the Twitch app to have a nice and easy to re-setup sync and backup. So I'm just hoping those are available soon... Threat meters definitely a must, y'know since threat actually will matter again XD
---
It's pretty awesome now! Even just the additions from NEXT totally changed the game, Beyond has been really dope asides from some bugs.
---
All I want is a video of him saying "We thought you didn't, but you did. Welcome home."
---
Imagine thinking I give a shit what browser people use.
---
Boars only root, you have enough tools to deal with warriors and the boar’s charge isn’t going to make or break the fight against a good rogue. 
---
Especially since the vast majority of rogues aren’t using skull/reflector, which means they're easy prey for hunters.
---
They're using the same infrastructure as WoW. Likely the most battle tested system in the industry. Login issues will be minimal and quickly resolved.
---
Cheers
---
You implied that Retail would be better if it was more like Classic. Why can't Classic and Retail just be their own games? Some people enjoy games where if you kill every boss in a raid you get 1-2 pieces of loot instead of possibly 0 even if you killed every boss for multiple weeks and luck just isn't in your favor or you're playing a popular class.
---
Just let Retail learn its own lessons, and keep the two separate.
---
Please leave my anal beads out of this.

If you are not a min-maxer I think it all comes down to aesthetics. Which race will you get tired or staring at every time you play; and do the animations of either race bother you?
---
If you are a min-maxer, the end game bis hunter weapon is not a gun. Nuff said.
---
This guy nations!
---
Is there an inherent threat modifier on shadowbolt? Haven't heard about that! Thanks for the info :)
---
To be honest I didn't get the idea until yesterday and I really liked the suggestion to have the last one rhyme with "tree" so it was closer to the source.
---
I was watching this at home with the virtual ticket while chatting on discord with some friends also watching.  We've been playing private servers for like 2 years at this point thru the ups and downs. 
---
As soon as he started talking about icecream everyone knew what was coming but no one could quite believe blizz was actually gonna do it.  Fucking epic moment man.
---
The higher the resolution, the less the CPU becomes the bottleneck. But yours may simply less than ideal overall.  
---
Maybe a 2nd hand I5-2500k or above would be better. And more RAM.
---
I agree, I think striving for BiS is admirable but not necessary for Phase 1 raiding. At the rate most people will be gearing, any of the top 2-3 pre-raid bis will be sufficient and then you will begin supplementing with raid gear. Additionally, bis is a somewhat subjective with gear like Ironfoe or BoE epic world drops. Some things that are pre-raid bis are just too unreasonable for your average player to aim for. I enjoy these guides because they help plan which raids to run when.

Don't be an aspie then and actually get to know other players. It's not difficult.

I've always considered 40 to be half way to 60.
---
The big brain move is just to not log out once you get in.
---
You could say the same exact thing about Minecraft, but look where that is.
---
Yes, with layering the server cap is very high. The layer cap is the same as vanilla, however.
---
Lmao putting agi below everything. There’s no point in having slightly less uptime if your kill speed is atrocious.
---
I'm not
---
Just get a smart fridge, should meet all the requirements.
---
My childhood computer was too potato to sit in IF... SW/Darn have always been my loves
---
You would level a character to 60 for 200 bucks? Might want to rethink your pricing bud.
---
Blood elves.. pfft..
---
You can spec MD/Ruin (Master Demonologist) for threat reduction (I think 20%, with Imp). It also allows you to be the tank Blood Pact Warlock at the same time without losing out on the benefits of a different spec. Full benefits from both Imp and your 30 points.
---
This is also a more flexible farming spec, where SM/Ruin is a more PvP flexible spec. It may be good if your tank is less geared, especially if you would like to have access to Demonic Sacrifice. (VW with either MD or using DS is great for soloing)
---
Sadly, you'll go 30 into Demo without having room for Soul Link at 31, but it is probably the 2nd most flexible Warlock spec after SM/Ruin.
---
It's a known bloodbath.  Also, there isn't many alliance quests in the area.   STV is figurative Vietnam.
---
Not how layering works. If there is only enough for 1 layer and not 3, then they will all be on 1 layer, not spread out across 3.
---

The alternative is massives login queues for weeks. Another 2 servers isn't going to kill anything.

I didn't realize where the video was going til the very end, I liked it overall. He did nail the quintessential dm run experience.
---
This looks useful - thanks.
---
I look forward to your enchanting guide.
---
I'm considering NElf just for the ability to shadowmeld and go afk as needed. Also shadow melding with you and a cat is pretty hilarious. However stoneform is crazy strong, particularly against rogues which can be a bad matchup for you since they can start the fights in melee range thanks to stealth. I wouldn't stress the extra NElf agi, just pick the one you aesthetically like better and leverage their particular advantages.
---
I thought the Console Port addon worked for Classic? Or does it not?
---
Dual wield was at level 20 iirc.
---
ya i think using all 3 is best
---
Blood Elves and Draenei were a great addition, but very much a product of the Burning Crusade. If Classic expands into TBC at all, then we'll see Blood Elves.
---
thanks for the advice sisters
---
Sli and nvlink are not the same. It's not a slave and master setup and gets close to 200% performance.
---
I don't understand how anyone can play FF14 for more than 30 minutes.  The intro is literally the worst intro to any game I've ever played.  I know people swear by the end-game and latest content, but I legit can't even make it out of the tutorial with how horrible it is.
---
This sums it up perfectly: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrCeHzysv4c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrCeHzysv4c)

It's because they're slow and boring not because it's fragile or hard.
---
Or we should just realize that all our heroes have flaws and it does no good to pretend that they don't
---
Then the queue goes from 4 hours to infinite hours, because literally everybody will be doing that after their first round in the queue.

Thanks for the comments! Yeah i really want to heal for raiding, but dont really want to do spriest for that DPS itch i need to scratch because of all the respeccing. I'm just worried if i go priest, it's going to be rough leveling, and at 60 could be rough for gold making unless i pick some money making profs.
---
I have a group of friends that are all going to play, but since I’m the only one with kids, I’m sure they’ll blow past me on leveling pretty quick.
---
Chat is on point.
---
No, just very stoned.
---
You seem to think high end raiding is the same as low level dungeons.
---
I think after seeing the Barrens, nothing could ever hurt me again.
---
Sell don’t buy got it
---
I think the the opposite, the shit already drained to thalnos with multiple languages and BR, and to Faerlina with streamers.
---
It takes awhile, particularly when the content is new. If you're a less popular class like hunter or druid you can gear up pretty fast if you're lucky.
---
T1 bracers and belts are actually traceable, you can even check the AH for them. The rest are BoP.
---
Prot pala when u can run with a druid or warrior instead for 0 downtime?
---
Right.
---
I can understand that in retail, since leveling in BFA is a totally neglected, horrible slog of a system. But classic has the best MMO leveling experience currently available, why not enjoy it?
---
This is quality
---
It's not Venruki's spec but generally the strongest frost PvP spec I've seen yet from Greatwizard on youtube.

If you don't have spell hit from gear.

Yea, not many people know about it nor care to do their own research. Don't get me wrong, Cats are great and will be my preferred pet outside of the levels we were discussing, but the Boar charge makes a small but noticeable difference, especially when you're chain pulling and your pet has to run 45 yards between mobs.  
---
Here is a good video from MetaGoblin that discusses pet choice as you level.  If you have 14 mins to spare, it is a good watch and gives a lot of information that most people don't know:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlb-POUbv8Y
---
I read the whole post, care to point out the specific part?
---
Just be ready for lots of grinding. Have a bunch of movies/shows you can watch while leveling. I'm basically rewatching every major show within the last twenty years from the wire/sopranos &gt; breaking bad.
---
Not tradeable and months
---
If you had to deal with this community for years you'd be saying you fucking idiots all the time.
---
40 man raid &gt; how many of these 40 are also your same class? &gt; can do the instance once a week &gt; depends on the random drop rate &gt; does anyone (tank/healer) have priority? It can take weeks or it can take MONTHS. People in this sub are way delusional about how easy it is to gear up with stuff like "Oh I'll just use X until I get Y from AQ40." lol ok
---
Probably months.
---
A couple months. Rogue and hunter sets are probably the harder ones to get, the others are very easy since nobody needs them for PvE progression. Only the belt and bracers are tradable, but they drop a lot and are expensive, so it's best to just win it in a roll rather than spend money on them.
---
with 40 people prob 6 months lol
---
i dont know exactly but its slow
---
He agrees with you, dude.
---
Imagine actually being excited for a game to fail. People need lives
---
If you have a pet turn off rain for instances.
---
Focus fire with the tank, don’t pull threat.
---
Watch out for patrolling mobs as pulling another group normally results in a wipe.
---
That is completely false. Unless you are critting on caster npcs while vastly outgearing the content (T2/T3) you will not be killing stuff before it reaches you.
---
On the Battle.net launcher ?
---
It's just because they're repetitive and a little slow. That's literally it
---
PvE servers were barely a thing for vanilla pservers. Almost everybody on pservers played PvP, and if your intention is to make PvP videos, then I can't think why someone would choose to play on a PvE server.
---
I will be using Luna unit frames
---
Solid plan. I agree on forgoing deep wounds, except if you get some special RNG with “of the tigers” gear, which I doubt it will happen consistently during the leveling process. I would recommend ‘Enrage’ as you’ll get crit’ed a lot during dungeon runs - helps on open wPvP as well if you’re rolling in a PvP Server.
---
That's good to know.
---
I'm imagining rogue opens (even if not in stealth) and you get crippling poisoned and they get in your freezing trap.
---
You slowly try to get some distance and mark them.
---
Open with aimed shot etc, they sprint to you and throw something if you have cheetah on (which you wouldn't).  They are trying to close the gap and you use concussive shot (and pray for stun), stun from pet talent. 
---
If they close the gap then you use at that point scattershot (or warsomp) and FD/freezing trap again.  And if you survived all that then you can prob kite em the rest of the way?
---
Did rogues often sap or blind you and disable your trap?
---

I'll see your Barrens and raise you what they did to Thousand Needles.

:thonking:
---
huh, breath of the wild still up there. Definitely the worst looking logo out of the 10.
---
No, I'm not. I genuinely think the original graphics are better, like in SC brood war. They are much simpler, clearer, and more true to the original spirit.
---
Months/you likely won’t complete the set and they’re not tradable
---
He's right tho buddy.  You need to up your shittalkin game.
---
All else being equal, people will always pick a human or dwarf over you.
---
Yes, if you pull threat you will die. If you die you can’t dps. It depends on the raid and boss.
---
I like how half the comments are Gehennas/Grob players seeking attention again.
---
So the whole plaguelands thing? Onyxia comes from wc2. Aq builds on nerubian lore stemming from wc3.
---
Clearly implying I had no idea how massively popular it was
---
She also introduced us to the caverns of time. So she's been around in the whole wow.
---
i'd rather be the one doing the ganking
---
I’ll be going it alone. No friends, no problem!
---
he meant AH
---
Forgot all about those, my bad
---
Stalagg's population is already well over 4k just on name reserve pre-launch.  It will end up packed but not "10 hour queue" Herod packed.
---
it did have a good name but i wouldnt say its that black and white. The streamers could have went anywhere they wanted and flipped it all on its head. I think a lot of people including myself saved their name on 3 potential servers and waited to see what was going to happen.
---
Pretty much everyone does pretty much everything for selfish reasons. As far as the terribleness of humans goes, Mark Kern is most certainly not on the ''genuinely terrible'' end of the spectrum.
---
&gt; I feel the people in charge of Retail WoW are quite detached from the community and the core of the game and what it once was to a lot of players.
---
I mean you say that, but every time they try removing one of the key "retail" features that contributed to what retail is today, people lose their fucking shit.
---
ElvUI with Luna for the Unit Frames and NeatPlates for the nameplates is my go to.
---
when your LoD wasnt far because your pc was just above minimum, yes!
---
I'd like to see the development of the Dunkan Arc
---
We are not talking about some casual group of pugs. These are the guys that will stick with a group of 5 and get 60 in the first week after release. If that is your goal there is no reason whatsoever to bring a ret or prot pala.
---
Nice idea! I wish it was longer
---
depends on your class and when you start raiding and rng.
---
hunters, warlocks and druids will gear quicker because there are only a few of them in the raid, if you join a raid where most of the people already have everything, you´ll gear quicker, and rng is a bitch. I started as a priest in a guild where most priest had already full t1. Raided pretty much till TBC, got most T1 in weeks, never got the shoulders.
---
How is it more tedious? Mining or herbalism is so much faster with a mount for example.
---
don't die 4Head
---
You aren't very good at trolling. You should practice a little more before Barrens Chat. 3/10
---
This is way too general and actually depends entirely on which professions you take.
---
Gold farmers tend to clump in certain areas; Ashzara, winter spring, felwood (sometimes)
---
It’s so damn fun hunting them down. 
---
I had one contact someone else and pleaded w me. Was actually very sad. More than I wanted to deal with while leveling up a pet / farming mats.
---
I am going in solo but my friends have never been interested in wow anyway so its not a new experience to me but I found a really cool guild so atleast I can get groups for dungeons and raids and have fun with people I enjoy chatting with.
---
In terms of leveling disadvantage your solo so you get 100% of xp but will do quests slower but unless your speed leveling or are in a hardcore guild that reqs lvl 60 by x days played then it shouldn't matter.
---
Im on EU Mirage raceway so if you see mervil online hit me up and if were similar level we can try and get something going.
---
Depends on the prof and your reasons for keeping it up to date.  You get enough weapons and armor from vendors + quests while leveling that to slow down the grind to hit 60 for the sake of leveling something with no benefit towards that goal of reaching 60 is silly.  It's easy enough to go back once 60 with a mount and etc to gather resources you require to level up whatever you like quickly.  Or buy it from the auction house if you are one of the first to hit 60 and can make gold faster than the price of goods go up.
---
Yeah there’s nothing cleave about Ret paladin.
---
You can't just say "blizzards knows better than you" and leave it at that. What discussion would come out of that. Then this whole classic wow reddit would exist for no reason at all.. I mean this is a forum after all.
---
Now i understand that you dont like this idea very much, but you have given 2 arguments that i can see - one is community clash and the other is name clash. The problem eith the names i have understood from the beginning and rhat is a problem. In worst case scenario some people gotta change, which sucks. But its worth it for healthy pop. 
---
About the community, you dont really know what community you will get on your chosen server before you start there either. I mean how much will it differ from pvp to pvp server for example. I woulsnt care about this one and my buddies that will play does not care either. As long as its pvp
---
I just want to understand why people dont want more servers. 
---
Peace
---
It's literally the same people, just in another department now just fyi
---
Right. Back in the day, I paid to have a warrior powerleveled from 1-60. Took them less than a week, was awe-inspiring. Character was deleted by Blizz shortly after hitting 60. 1 for Blizz/China, 0 for Me.
---
It was asked in a couple different Q&amp;As and answered the same both times, I am having trouble finding the video now but I think the most recent was like may or june of this year.
---
This is not possible.
---
Auction house got it
---
Everyone in these threads acta like berserking isn't beneficial to both pve and pvp which is pants on head retarded to me. I'll take a haste buff racial over potential stun resist any day. The real downside of playing troll is looking at those gross ass feet....
---
I'd never prioritize it over agi/int either, but it is definitely a factor and nice to have.
---
Your CPU is definitely the main bottleneck, and considering how old it is and its dated socket type, there isn’t really an upgrade path that will get you to the point of 4k gaming. No matter the GPU you get. 4GB of ram is also a bit low (I’d aim for atleast 16) and the 970 isn’t the best card for 4k either.
---
If I were you, I’d start saving for a total system upgrade down the line and play in 1080 for now
---
Lol yeah, I’ll prob be a few months behind. Thanks hopefully I can start owning some alliance noobs.
---
Many agree with you on that one I think!
---
No worries, that is always the risk when using text and not talking!
---
Well.. I’m happy to see this! 💪🏼
---
Made my toons on a medium pop server the day reservations started. It's now full.
---
It is certainly black and white. That's why herod is multitudes bigger than ever other server, lol.
---
It was just one plus it’s the worst BG they added in the game Literally any other BG is ten times better.
---
Idk about ashran and winter grasp personally I never been fan of pve and pvp at the same time
---
Comes from WoW's cartoony graphics, which people like to use to discredit WoW. But really its one of the strengths, it has led to most zones being incredibly unique and prevented the game from looking too outdated.
---
They don't know how to hype more than 1 release at the same time, so they announce and ignore until its turn comes up.
---
Its generally faster to level professions at 60 because of movement speed, availability, prices, and you don't aggro mobs in most zones
---
One thing I was thinking about today was the joy of finding a chest and /rolling to see who would open it.  It’s not much but there were times you would actually get something good.
---
No worries. Don't forget to avoid them on the run! They hurt.
---
I mean if its a reasonable queue time it isnt bad but for herod its expected to be 10,000 at the very least. Take into account people doing things to prevent logout on afk its gonna take A LOT of time to get in the server. Takes you 4 hours to get into server, you go eat supper now you gotta wait another 4 hours to get back in.
---
I applied for that guild back in the days but my mom stopped paying for the internet before I found out :(
---
You will not be barred from groups
---
You will be scrutinized more because try hards will assume you aren’t a try hard based on your race.
---
In raids there will almost always be another dwarf priest to cast fear ward.
---
Coming from a former hardcore player my simple advice is that Dwarf priest is extremely helpful for a new player. You should have a higher bar than “not being barred from groups”. You want those group to be great and succeed. You can succeed in any PvE encounter as a night elf  priest but if you try to be part of the more winning pvp teams being a dwarf would be highly beneficial. 
---
My top two picks going into classic are warrior and dwarf priest. I would have no problem being any race of warrior but I would never choose anything other than dwarf priest, but that’s just my feelings. If you like being a nelf so much I’d pick a warrior, hunter, or druid. If you like healers a human paladin is a great choice
---
Agreed. I don’t even think I like mmos at all. Tried them all and they all fall short or just don’t deliver the way wow does. Maybe I just like wow but to say it’s nostalgia is ridiculous
---
No, hes saying the cap is higher only with layering, but Blizz said the base cap for servers is higher.
---
Only buy the skills you REALLY NEED to leveling. Otherwise you'll be super broke. Literally only buy the skills you NEED. Learn first aid. Loot everything from mobs and vendor it. Don't buy anything from AH while leveling. 
---
Try to look up where your current best weapon/wand is from. Maybe it's a quest or maybe it's an easy drop from an instance. Keeping your weapon up to date will help with leveling a lot.
---
Ask mages for food/water to save money,
---
End game means faster movement speed and potential for aoe farming of materials, as well as gold to spend on the materials themselves if you’ve been lucky with drops or wise with your money.
---
All in all it’d be much more timely to level with skinning and pick up your professions when you’re closer to 60.
---
This of course ruins character immersion, but in my opinion is far less tedious than having to stick around an area you outlevel because everyone is getting to nodes before you are.
---
Only thing might be if they close servers for new players and you've got friends on those. I don't know how likely that is, but it might be a consideration.
---
oh god I remember when I did RFD back in vanilla with my hunter and I rolled for corpsemaker and won, and also rolled for the dagger from the boar and won....
---
did use the axe for few levels... the raptor strike hits in bg werent impressive.. facepalm..
---
Couldn't you overlay something else on top of the dot?
---
I feel like I already got my sub's worth of enjoyment out of the open test. Went around world with few friends and made new ones on the way, hunted rare and elites, did high level quests and crafting for great gear, PvPd in all forms and even had some goofy RP with random people to pass the time.  
---
Launch isn't all that far away, so there's nice break to get my stuff together before it.
---
The treacherous "Horde" must be stopped.
---
PC gaming was a thing before PlayStation came out.
---
Do I have to be a member to use the site?
---
Once you go gnome you never go home  I already reserved gnomefather
---
No idea. You'll need to be in a full raid to do it so there's gonna be at least one priest.
---
I was editing that comment. They are slower than Paladins at start. At 40, especially with Shadowform, they surpass Paladins when a Pally starts slowing down at same level.
---
I may give one of those suggestions a try. Thanks for the feedback!
---
You mean taste is subjective?  Who’s have guessed.
---
This is the sensible answer. All realms will be full and have huge queues once the launch crowd comes in.
---
It'll have backlash from those who already despise layering, but the other half of the community will just repeat "Stop whining, Blizzard knows best" like they always do.
---
should be named *Mike of Kern
---
Thanks a lot! The only thing that I don't like about joana's is that the website is not "smart" (images with low quality, icons...)
---
So, because you are a woman, you know more about the statistics of how many women are playing WoW Classic, than an actual real statistic with over 50000 people? And I am the asshole? I dont care that you are a woman, I would argue against these idiotic remarks even if you were a man, you are the one making this about you being a woman and about women, you fucking twat.
---
It won't be that bad really. It's going to suck for that first day for sure but not everyone took time off and people eventually do have to sleep. I'd say probably only 5-10% of the total population is going to truly no life the game.
---
200 for a level 60?
---
Do you accept PayPal?
---
A sound plan*
---
The game hasn’t even started and people are getting attached to their servers. I fucking love it.
---
Stalagg already has well exceeded the number of characters the most populated server in vanilla ever had and the game doesn’t launch for over a week.  This is the dumbest take on the situation imaginable.

You will never be barred from a group based on your race. You "might" be prioritized in specific situations based on your racial. For example, if you were trying to join an Onyxia PUG and they need 1 more priest. If a NE priest and a dwarf priest message that group they might prefer the dwarf priest. There's no chance they would require all the priests to be dwarf or even choose to delay the group to wait for a dwarf priest if a NE priest was readily available for that last spot.
---
I was a night elf, and hadnt seen the world map, I swam the entire North coast of kalimdor on a whim, dragged my corpse through azsharas coast and took the boat in ratchet to booty bay after I found out they didn't want me in ogrimmar.
---
Absolutely using a guide here
---
The problem is when a significant portion of the initial player base drops out after the first 2-3 weeks.  Will the low pop servers still even hit that 3k mark?  Maybe not.
---
I don't know about that. They've said they would release vanilla, warts and all. Don't think they'll fix it before release, or maybe if the outcry becomes crazy online even before it's launched, I could see Blizzard nerfing it before launch.
---
I didn't say anything about expansions.
---
you did. all you need is a sub. i'm not quite sure, but maybe there is a policy for refunding BFA or something
---
I know, chances are it was on a PvP server. I was just replying to the above comment which seemed to imply that this was on a PvE server
---
This is true but Founding of Durotar campaign.  That made me go Horde.
---
All 3 are so different, first you need to decide what it is your goals are in Classic.
---
* PVE? PVP? Both?
---
* DPS? Tank? Heal? Support?
---
I can’t tell if you’re big brain trolling or just didn’t get the obvious sarcasm.
---
You haven’t heard? There is layering so the game is dead. Why even be excited?
---
That’s Dumb of blizz
---
I think it should, yeah. Never tried myself.
---
That is a PvP server tho..
---
&gt; 110 begin.
---
Thrall's Balls. The grind was insulting and borderline insane when Legion was current (I did both). Now? Feels basically like a middle finger to anyone with an active WoW sub that hasn't unlocked them yet.
---
I wouldn’t use a guide unless for some reason you just NEEED to be level 60 as quickly as possible. Classic wow is much more than end game material. Leveling is much more fun than Live
---
Hot damn I think we just uncovered something great here.
---
Turns out that joy and fun is subjective
---
That it's actually disappointing, not dissapointing
---
&gt; Needles to say

Aw crap. Oh well.
---
Levelling in retail is just a means to an end, in classic it’s its own rewarding experience. I think a guide would ruin the experience a bit.

No it doesnt.  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=11285](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11285)  vs  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18042](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18042)

It's pretty obvious that thorium is best when compared to vendor arrows.
---
yea good luck with that lmao, who the fuck has time to /invite jûp!tëB
---
I'm thinking more in terms of player volume, but you could be right. I'm just assuming it'll be more like 3-4 than 2-3
---
I'm tempted to do this just so I can farm without having to respec.
---
Just weapon enchants for melee makes them 100x stronger than they should be, a couple points of stamina or strength on your gear doesn't give that much of an edge, but Crusader does.
---
Take the name you want.
---
Gauging something like this on reddit most likely won't give you very accurate results anyway, since it's usually a certain type of player who come here. I don't think that many people will give a shit come launch, unless you play RP.
---
And really, if someone doesn't want to play with you because of your name, ask yourself, is that something YOU want to play with.
---
It made my cry ;-; so beautiful, vanilla is my favorite taste
---
Insecure are we? Nothing cooler than being openly passionate about the things you're passionate about. You should try telling you're friends you are a nerd.
---
You don’t need a spec for dungeons.
---
There are always microcosms of sweaty neck beards that think that min maxing everything on paper is more important than having a brain between your computer chair and your monitor.  Recruiting a priest is more important than recruiting a fear ward; that being said you will probably get segregated against if you app to the top guild on your server.
---
That's some next level shithousing
---
Higher than vanilla, about 7-8k.
---
It was truly amazing.
---
Thanks for letting me know. I'll try it when classic drops.
---
I played nost hardcore and was full BiS by the time blizzard shut it down. The *only* issues I can recall were about 3 separate nights of lag and mind control would sometime stop randomly.
---
The creative decisions and design philosophy that inspired classic 15 years ago is vastly different than who they are now.
---
They're not making something I respect, they're animating the corpse of something I loved to sell it to me. It's a moment in gaming history just because of how many people are going to be playing. Other than that, it's no different from private.
---
definitely not, but i'm thinking about an addon to only show the quest givers locations
---
I don't want anything more than that
---
Thanks bud! Saving this
---
Its just one special letter, but I appreciate your overreaction.
---
I work full time and have a child. My wife is a stay at home mom and my kid is under 2 years old.

Wake up at ~8:25
---
Work 9am to 5pm
---
Kid time, make/eat dinner, 5:30pm to 7:45pm.

Put kid to bed and clean the house 7:45pm to 8:30pm
---
Do whatever (like classic wow) ~8:30pm to ~1:30am

Assuming no external issues or unexpected responsibilities, this is my recipie for seven hours of sleep, 4 to 5 hours of free time a night, and a wife who doesn't resent me.

No way. As you said, it takes a lot of the fun out of it. I am however gonna use Questie which shows any available quests on the map - a good compromise.
---
Thank you very much Nickipotamus!
---
Weakauras 2 or LunaUnitFrames
---
You're really gonna give rewards to a guy who has 20 people helping him nolife his way to 60?
---
A leve 60 showing us where to farm lvl 40 mobs doesn’t seem like a real how to. Leeway can’t just run around gathering but I guess we will see how it goes when classic is live! Best of luck to you
---
Looks like it's about to rain
---
So it is...
---
I'd argue casuals have even more incentive to stay logged-in afk than hardcore players. When you've only got 2 hours a day to play, you don't really have the option to sit in a 4 hour queue.
---
Get out night elf refugees dun morogh is gonna be packed as is my gnome will kill all elves on sight

As foretold by Durruti

Taste aside, what they accomplished with a fraction of the time, manpower, and resources is astounding.  So many more viable builds too.
---
Yes :)

The people who route speed runs to the limit and the people who run that route to the limit have rarely been the same people.

Just started reading the series, we’ll see how far i get till the 27th
---
no shit are you sure
---
Yea man, I really wanted to use  '*Ænema'* but I know it's such a bad idea.
---
Imagine the hype that would create, and not least the $$$ for Activision. When they announced classic for summer and WC3 reforged on Blizzcon I took it for granted it would release before Classic - it just makes sense
---
She even made it into Hots, for what it's worth.
---
Unless you’re speed leveling a Ret paladin. Around level 40 to 55 there’s a huge gap where no 2 handers are available from quests. 
---
If you’re unable to get in a uldaman run for the 2 hander, take a glance at AH for the possibility of a BoE that is reasonably priced. You have gold to spare since the 40 mount is free.
---
Whoa! Dude, slow down
---
When you log in if there are too many people trying to log in it will put you in a queue. Once you log in you will be brought to character selection. So the queue applies to everyone on the server. Not just people trying to make a new character
---
Thats high elfes isnt it? I dont remember them beeing blood elfes.
---
Why do you want your dings recorded? Curious
---
I am trying but I can't. What's wrong with me?
---
What about all the people that help him?
---
I don’t hate leveling but I find just questing to be boring as fuck. I will not be using a guide and will quest some. Really just plan to do what I want when I want. Grind, dungeon, and whatever whenever I feel like. Probably be about 240 hours played time for me. I am ok with that though.
---
Looking at all his replies, I am starting to think he's just an elaborate troll.

Like I said, I watched classic 4K footage. I like just like high resolutions, some people like 144hz monitors, others don’t care about such stuff.

Thank you for the comment. I am definitely leaning that way as well. Especially since I plan on being very active in a guild so I wont be pugging much anyway and hoping that my name won't be an issue for invites if I am active in a guild.
---
I would love to know if this true
---
y r u like this
---
You reserve 3 names. Put at least one on Stalagg. Hedge your bets and decide where you want to be by level 10 and then stick with it until 60
---
When confronted with common sense and facts I would end the conversation as well. This is the issue, you think I am attacking your love of PvP servers.... when I myself have always played on PvP servers because I enjoy them. 
---
You were likely very young and are only remembering exceptionally fun PvP moments.... when the reality was vast mostly empty world with people avoiding you if at all possible.
---
Did open world pvp happen randomly and often with small skirmishes at dungeons and other hot spots, sure it did.... but that is such a minor part of the game that no reasonable and experienced MMO player would recognize that as anything substantial...... Especially adults who had already been playing open world pvp games for many years when Wow released.
---
I wish you the best.
---
I think they make that decision themselves when they opt to make him the first person to 60, it's similar to the Athene situation.
---
Because someone who won't have time to level up a character surely won't have time to do anything in endgame, therefore they might aswell go on a pserver and jerk off to their fully geared character..
---
So it being a separate region doesn't mean shit?
---
It's amazing how much we forget. Sorry for the miss-information, removing the Post.
---
Rational take WeirdChamp
---
I'm in the middle of an exam period here, I'll look at it when I finish.
---
So, in other words this is what should have been the OP.
---
You can't heal allied npcs in Vanilla?
---
People generally want a name as a handle, so people can easily identify each other and add to friends etc.
---
So if they were called zappypants, that's fine and easy to recognise, zappy for short.
---
I mean, if people are going to be doing it anyway - Why not at least get something for it
---
No u
---
He's wrong about where the source is, but Blizzard did say each layer would have a similar capacity to a vanilla server at launch. [Here's the interview.](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=235)
---
Not me.
---
Have an alt standing in a capital city that you send all items you intend to put up on the AH. Or any item at all really that you wanna keep. Mail will be kept for a number of days (7 or 14 I believe?) and then returned if not picked up prior to that. Essentially giving you loads of free storage.
---
Will players be barred from groups based on racials? Absolutely not.  Only in the most elite echelon of progression PvP or raiding might a person bat an eyelash at your race/class choice - but even then it will likely not be a deciding factor.
---
Or to rewatch the cinematics if you don't own it.
---
Oh thats too bad :(
---
 Druid is a great class to play for someone who is unsure what class to roll. The leveling is super fun as feral, among the strongest class for leveling in the game. You can tank dungeons or heal them( just need to get a set of +int greens as feral). So have options to do whatever you think is most fun.
---
 You have travel form which means you don't have to stress getting a mount at exactly 40( nerdy math is if you are traveling longer than 17 second 40 mount is faster, shorter and travel form is faster because of the 3 second cast time of mount).
---
 The problem is endgame. Feral will fall behind and become less viable. You can tank every dungeon fine but raids will require a lot of work. Most probably you are going to feel forced to spec healing. If you like healing though the class is great all the way through vanilla. Druid only becomes a mistake to roll if you go into it expecting to dps or be the best tank.
---
 Regarding warrior. They are a bit tougher to level but it's not as hard as some might make it seem. If you do some research for where to get weapon upgrades and read up a bit the leveling is no problem. Back in original classic my first 60 was a warrior. Was fine leveling and I didn't know half as much as people do today.
---
thanks! I didnt want to break the classic style thatswhy i scrapped most of the other cinematic footage. 
---
First I thought about implementing some wc3 cinematic footage but the orcs and overal style doesnnt look similiar enough to the WoW cinematic so i figured it would destroy the style to some degree
---
At least as a mage though you can just port around lol. 
---
I think I’ll have to set theramore as my hearth and then hearth every time I want to train. And then boat back ? Gonna suck lol
---
Like is this guy aware that MMO’s were a thing before PlayStation even came out?
---
&gt;Electronic arts
---
I like the name jüpiter. Go with it if you like.
---
What did they do to make it so much better?
---
I've always been confused about this but why would you want slower attack speed on the cat?
---
move to another layer OMEGALUL
---
You'll really enjoy it when you're spamming executes on raid bosses for crazy damage. Well, that's when I start really enjoying it at least.
---
You're right, but fortunately there are no low pop servers left on us or EU realm lists.  They all say at least medium.
---
thanks so much for the info, this is answer I've been looking for
---
Blizzard has no clue what is coming, they better get more servers up before Launch day.
---
Was frustrating but whatever, really. My vanilla server often had queues during peak for years. Usually 200-400 people. You just get used to it and do something else while logging in...
---
Subtlety is the best in world pvp imo. You can easily 100-0 any class while keeping them stun locked. Least gear dependable as well.
---
To my knowledge
---
Faerlina = Streamer server and possibly LatAm server
---
Thalnos = Brazilians (probably be less than 10% of the population)
---
Herod = The choice everyone who is not a streamer or south of the states is going for currently, the population could be twice as big as the next highest server (source: various discord polls and blue posts). People seem stubborn about staying here.
---
Whitemane = West coast Herod 
---
Fairbanks = Flying under the radar a bit right now, might be sleeper OP
---
Stalagg = New NA East coast server, probably released to give relief from Herod. The population is slowly rising. 
---
Grobbulus = NA rppvp (lots of people wont actually be RPing) 
---
EU
---
Shazz = Herod of EU, absolutely fking bursting with players I think this is also the EU streamer server (not sure)
---
Golemagg = Also full, but not to the extend of Shazz 
---
Gehenn = Just got launched along side stalagg to serve as relief for Shazz. &lt;APES&gt; a predominante turboneckbeard sweat machine is rolling on this server now (alliance)
---
They just posted new models last week tho
---
How do you know that it'll be added in phase 3 and not phase 1?
---
If it proves that I am wrong, I will change it right away but afaik nothing about when the raid items (MC loot specifically) will be added, hence I'm assuming they'll be there from start.
---
Thank you Oghier!  There are a number of people looking forward to that guide so it'll likely be one of the next couple guides to come out.  Keep an eye out for it!
---
I like this alot. Thank you!
---
Thanks for your reply. 
---
WoW classic never requires more than 900mb of the ram, that’s why I don’t aim for higher ram. The machine will only ever have to handle classic, no other games. 
---
A CPU upgrade means a mainboard upgrade and a new cooler aswell, this would be too expensive for me. 
---
I think I’ll be able to achieve 4K with my rig and an upgraded GPU. Just, which one, if the 970 isn’t the best 4K card?
---
Suggestions are still much appreciated 🙂
---
Total troll comment it's obviously a great video. But the WoW fans and DBZ fan venn diagram is pretty much a circle
---
I'd try Jupter or Jupeter tbh, people rarely read the middle letters anyway
---
dont tell me how to live my life
---
Not to be that one, but Activision actually gave us classic, blizzard made it, Activision released it. Fucking Activision.
---
I played the most in wotlk and a decent amount in cata. Came back at legion and quit after a month. Came back for bfa and quit after a week. I think cata was my just hoorah.
---
Truuuuuue
---
Thank you very much Orsini87 :)
---
!remindme 9 days
---
Well the reality is we don't know the number. 3500 was based off of a dude doing /who on his server (which returns a max of 50 results) and SLOWLY accumulating a server pop size. 
---
But the essence of your words is correct. Whatever the original cap was, that is what the cap will be in Classic when they disable layering.
---
The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: 六四事件, liùsì shìjiàn), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.
---
I quit mid-latw TBC. Looking forward to trying Vanilla again for sure for the nostalgia. Not really sure what made me quit!
---
Still not sure what that means, is it a type of burrito filling?
---
r/noisygifs
---
You said "nowadays" which made me imply you were referring to the current iteration of the game.
---
To be fair, current wow is alot more available and forgiving for anyone being anything resembling an adult with responsibilities. I think current wow is very nice.
---
I am in a group of 5 friends super excited to play Classic together. Only 2 of us subscribed early to get our names, 3 will join on or after the 26th.
---
They will be both on horde, if they don’t change their mind come release
---
you mean back in vanilla ? yes you had to purchase the game but for classic you won't need to
---
War3 is one of the greatest rts games of all time even just the multiplayer.

My server is on medium, what's a queue?
---
I agree, but I wouldn't say aq and naxx were/are easy.
---
2 accounts
---
Awesome. Thanks, will keep checking in on this.
---
But besides all that, what have they done for me lately?
---
Everything isn't doable. Warriors can't blink.
---
As long as you keep aggro and don't die, you can tank with whatever gear and spec you want.
---
The 5-man dungeons are generally pretty easy. Early on you'll probably have to wear some amount of Prot gear to not die while tanking. But after you and your healer get some raid gear then you'll be able to tank them in DPS gear just fine.
---
Your math is wrong. Speed run times for 1-20 is like ... 8-9 hours? If you're doing 1-20 in 24 hours you're almost 3 times slower than that. At that rate you're looking at 15 days played approximately. (Btw I'm not trying to be negative, I've just calculated time to 60 taking in my slackness and comparing to speed run splits. Just making sure you know what to expect.)
---
He was so smug in the first panel hahaha, but yeah.. props to him for having the balls to go back on it and be the one to announce it essentially saying "i was wrong" - it's hard for anyone to do. I'm glad he did too!
---
This process would be so much easier if there were thousands upon thousands of articles written over the last 15 years to help with such a question. Thankfully Reddit is here for you
---
Honestly if people want to truly enjoy classic then this is genuinely the way to achieve that. I plan on playing similar to how I played back in the day. No guides, minimal mods, etc. I do have extensive game knowledge that's the biggest difference
---
Raiding is expensive.  5 hour MC raid = 5 flasks, and a bunch of thistle tea, and other consumables.  Or do you want to be kicked out for doing less damage than the Oomkin?   You will have a pvp and raid spec gear that you switch between.  Getting pvp gear is easier than raid gear, and you tend to do that during your downtime.
---
Refresh your browser.
---
And it's been happening for a while now, not just since the redesign.
---
Fuck I gotta watch that game, I fell asleep after draft.  
---
Damn Shanghai time
---
they are one of the most boring solo lvlers and one of the slowest(still not terrible overall). BUT in 2's with certain matchups they can be very fun and good at leveling. Druid pally can aoe pull for days, i just got my druid to badlands on PS and my pally is 41, they can pull the vulture pack and the druid only has to heal once every 10 seconds, i think this quo could handle pulls of 20-30 mobs with concentration and planning. In classic things will be even easier. Reflect dmg paladin is fun to level with a healer and I bet it's worth it just to bully rogues at 60 with.
---
They won't have a million players running around though everyone will just sit in a que, layering won't even make it to phase 2 it will be out of the game very quickly
---
That’s the joke.
---
Maybe have a few +hit pieces? Should be fine. You've got hemo, so there's not a real lack of DPS, you'll just do a chunk less of white damage
---
Yeah....... except most guilds will want to at least slightly optimize their raid composition to make the process as painless as possible. If you do not attempt to pull your weight, then you do not deserve a raid slot over someone else who can.
---
I'm curious: why do you think just *poof* level 60 is game ruining?  
---
People who want to play the leveling game will play the levelling game. People who want to skip 2 months worth of progress, come into game with level 60 greens and no clue on how to play the game will then do so.  
---
It will become apparent, quickly, who levelled and who didn't. Or, in the case of a banned account, this made sure they didn't have to spend 1-2 months levelling back up to 60 and still know how to play.
---
This would annoy the piss out of me
---
One of the primary reasons I think WoW lost so many people over the years is due to simplifying the game. Look how popular vanilla is and arguably it's almost the opposite of the current expansion.
---
Didn’t they try and group you with other players? But it messed up the spec config usually..
---
You all then had make your way to the dungeon manually iirc.
---
lol just don't click on any red names in a starting area and you should be good.
---
In my memory, since I can't currently check, she's the npc that gives you the tour and shows you the different entrances. It's 1 quest to follow her around the middlepart.
---
There will be no medium pop servers. 
---
Please consider the fact that there are many people who haven't signed up yet because they aren't subscribed yet.  
---
How many? Who knows? Another 80%?  
---
I bet it's going to be night unplayable on release.
---
I personally only did starting areas
---
I'm surprised it includes windows 7. It's pretty close to end of life, and I'd imagine someone at the bottom of spec requirements is paying for the extended windows 7 support.
---
But how come they get imp blizzard and improve arc missiles? I've seen venruki pvp a lot and he never uses either. He will use blizzard only sometimes in large scale battles for Lols
---
Not exactly what you're asking but this shield is excellent for AoE tanking. Will procc loads when tanking many mobs. Otherwise engineering shield is godlike.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13243
---
Oil of Immolation and grenades are essential for Warriors trying to keep aoe threat. Great for palas  too. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=8956
---
Because a strong portion of people found leveling to be extremely tedious and obnoxious and found the fun in the game to be level 60.
---
So,  whole you might enjoy leveling, other people hate leveling. I hated it by the second or third 60, it was a painful and grueling experience on some classes.
---
I will use a guide to rush to 60 farm up gold and start flipping in the AH. If i would play more casual i wouldnt use one and enjoy the ride.
---
Haha yeah, you joke but thats basically heirlooms
---
I'm doing it right now. As someone who never really learned any of the lore it's great. Walking into undercity in the streastest seeing the throne where Arthas murdered his father was pretty neat now that I know what it's all about. There is a easter egg there as well by the way. I'll leave it up to you to find out. 
---
Also it's an awesome game on its own.
---
I enjoyed playing through TBC and Wrath, but even though they were fun for me they still introduced features with irreversible damage such as flying mounts in TBC and catch-up gear in Wrath. I think both of the expansions were fun, but they are **expansions** and not version of a game that I would consider a real game. 
---
They were both designed to be played through and then tossed away; which they were. Only the original game (vanilla) was designed to be a consistent world with no obsolete content.
---
Cata and onwards the game was dead to me.
---
I think all servers will be full on launch, i bet once a lot of people see the queue times on the full server they will change.
---
There's gonna be enough Dwarf Priests. You're fine
---
Is it really that hard to gear up for PVP?
---
Honestly, they’ve added so much over three big updates it would be best to just find the patch notes and read for yourself because the content releases have been substantial.
---
Level as feral and focus on feral gear (agi/atm/str). Don't bother buidling a caster set until you hit 60, since you'll be replacing gear constantly while leveling.
---
Feral doesn't care about mana until they have Wolfshead Helm and that isn't until level 40.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345
---
Even then, you don't NEED to powershift if all you're doing is grinding quests mobs. The extra mana from a caster set won't help that much anyways since you can drink when out of combat too.
---
Agreed, twink yourself or just play 60 BG's. That is just the way it will be, and I am fine with it.
---
Winter spring will feel real authentic now
---
Well, no need to be curious anymore. This won't be a thing.
---
Throw your email my way and i gotchu fam

Loot council is a scam. Even if you know the people, then you are the one scamming people. Never in my history of playing have I ever seen a loot council system that doesn't leave people behind. DKP, rolls or bust.

Classic is a different beast from private servers though. What made APES dominant was their collusion with other big guilds for the devilsaur farm. That shit will be shut down real fast on Classic due to a ToS breach.
---
APES by themselves, while still being disruptive, aren't as invincible as reddit likes to make it seem. 
---
Additionally, people that play Classic will be more invested in the sense that there finally is permanence to their characters. This isn't a private server that could be shut down within a day's notice. Therefore, there is more incentive for people to fight back against disruptive players/guilds.
---
To be fair it pisses me off too, but i'm too invested now to stop it
---
Time your life taps for when you need to threat dump.
---
I would expect to be half t2 before you’re full t1
---
Except alot of bosses are immune to taunt.
---
I felt the damage increase wasn't worth the hours spent struggling in the starter zone solo with terrible tagging abilities. So I walked to the tauren starting area to meet up with a friend. They don't have any WL trainers over there.
---
RIP that inbox.
---
That's pretty neat. Every server ought to do this.
---
I think that's a good point, never thought of it that way. Expansions are designed almost as planned obsolescence, as you know there will always be a new one
---
I can't get my old friends into going back, but I know I'll meet plenty of people on the way. Shit I met somebody in beta before level 5 I ran into a few times, and quested with them for a while
---
I did it last weekend swimming and it wasn’t bad. Maybe 15 minutes

Several people have stated that the whelps were wildly inaccurate on private servers

"genuinely terrible"

lol, using those kinds of terms to describe people says more about you than it does about Mark.
---
Yea it opened a menu that would tell you any other group that was at the stone looking for more. It wouldnt tell you what they needed (but this aided to the community aspect because it made you ask the group leader what they needed) and you couldnt summon with it. 
---
My issue with it was the 20-30 minutes it took after the group was filled to get the group started - and that is if you didnt have someone sit in the group till it filled and decide they didnt want to run and drop out of the party. 
---
Either way, question answered. I will suffer once again because i am now on the hype train and that isnt enough to make me turn it down.
---
No its not. The Alliance Guide stops at Level12.
---
This is the epitomy of complaining to complain.
---
Ill probably dabble in some pvp but mainly pve.
---
DPS isnt my thing, always been a fan of tanking and healing
---
I never got much into MoP, tried it a bit on pservers as I quit in Cata, but honestly I enjoyed being a monk. Something about the class, while goofy, actually felt quite good to me.
---
Lol Wetlands as Horde. Hope you're doing that on a PvE server
---
I liked it so much I'm gonna roll on Herod so I can be around such creative people.
---
Yeah, this extremely early on. I only remember using it for deadmines tbh.
---
Dont listen to the guy above, the whole «not want to play with» cringe has nothing to do with what people think of you, but when there are 5 people whispering, people tend to invite whoever is take the lowest effort to invite.

&gt; WoW didn't just casualize itself - it casualized the entire MMO industry.
---
WoW didn't casualize the industry. It marketed itself to both casual and hardcore players. It has a little bit of something for everyone. 
---
It's the Wal-mart of MMOs. 
---
The true "casualization" of the MMO genre are the mobile games like Clash of Clans.
---
Have your friend go PI spec and have him chuck that sucker on then spam searing pain and when you wipe blame the tank.
---
So all the mouseovers will work for the frames AND the players avatar?

Ah, the internet
---
I like MoP for the monk class
---
I don’t really mind the queues, I’m more worried about the gameplay. 
---
If there is to much people for quests, grinding and gathering. 
---
I have no clue if it will be affected.
---
Since the short sighted mods see it fit to shadow ban this high effort discussion post:
---
Knowledgeable players and guilds often farm and invest so effectively that they can have significant amounts of gold and resources even well into Naxx patch, starting from the very first phase of the game.
---
Without spilling too many beans, the top 1% of players will abuse layering at level 60 in such a way that it will permanently affect server economy by how many of certain items are present and how concentrated gold and resources are in top guilds (price fixing the economy).
---
Very few people are going to level to 60 quickly, and even as phase 1 is ending level 60s won't be a massive portion of the playerbase.
---
Especially early on, maybe level 50-60s (where most relevant exploits will occur) should always be in the same layer? Or not sharded into layers at all?
---
Again, not to spill any beans, but top guilds are already completely set in plans on exactly how to abuse and exploit layering.
---
This specific aspect of continent sized sharding or layering doesn't seem to be getting enough recognition.
---
The issue with this is that unlike some bugs or other inconsistencies, layering has the potential to affect Classic WoW servers for the entire duration of their existence.
---
Proposed solution: Disabling layering for level 50-60 zones, which will be very underpopulated regardless (early in server life and even later), would mitigate virtually all economically relevant layer hopping abuse.
---
When was the last time you played wow? There's heirlooms and level boosting on live... and gold if you want it.

DKP all the way

I agree with you. Stalagg will be packed. this guy above me is stupid

The lowest I would go in order to reach 60 FPS (a TV won't run any higher without motion blur, which should be turned off) would be a GTX 1070. It really depends on what your budget is. If you could give me a number, I could be of more guidance.
---
For me, everything has been done to death at this point. Sure the “best” strategies are well known, but I am more interested in playing more wacky and unusual builds and seeing what is possible and having silly fun.
---
Granted I say that with a schedule that won’t allow for much raiding if any at all. I would be overjoyed for just a full tier 1 set for my priest.
---
Not sure what you're talking about, that was a thing on r/wow months ago when people who hated BfA were still there, many people have left since then.
---
Actually many people on r/wow currently have giant hate boner against Classic and are reporting/downvoting Classic posts because these kind of posts don't belong there in their opinion, that's the current situation of r/wow.
---
Preach brother
---
Really? There are thousands of people running around in the same world? Or is it so huge you don’t run into people?
---
You need to buy bfa in order to play bfa.  You only need a subscription in order to play classic.
---
What if I told you people enjoy the game in different ways?
---
Sure, I think that's objectively true. That doesnt mean that is what WoW should be
---
It has little to nothing to do with HP regen... it has more to do with stuns, instant attacks, stealth and tools for CC and escape.... Warrior is bottom tier while solo.... and becomes god tier while duo. Rogue is low-high tier to mid tier while solo and does not change much in duo....
---
Ignorance on spirit comment ignored.
---
Sadly no Remaster, yet. I'll play D3 when the new Season starts instead.
---
&gt; It won't be the real experience of classic if everyone knows where Mankrik's wife is. Move her and make people ask again
---
It would take someone ten seconds to google search her new position. 
---
Classic WoW isn't going to have the same nostalgia factor that you're looking for, even if changes are made to quests. 
---
The amount of information and resources available to the players will be staggering.
---
"any class who's guild expects them to use their classes toolkit should just leave"
---
A lot of effort has gone into selecting servers. There are entire councils of guilds who have selected Herod and they’re not going to budge after thousands of people have reserved their names. This is on a Blizzard for not just opening up a few more servers and then doing a forced prelaunch merge if there wasn’t enough interest, and now there’s nothing they can do to fix it.
---
There's no specific policy outline for trading BFA gold for classic gold. Transactions of that nature would need to follow Section 1.C.iii of Blizzard's End User License Agreement and their Trade Scams in-game policy within World of Warcraft:

You still have to press the corresponding key for this to work.  Optionally, Clique is a great addon for this functionality if you want to forgo the macros.
---
&gt; Sharpen the quest text.
---
Is there any type of font that you can read better than others? If so, then you can try replace the fonts in WoW with the one you can read. Here is how you do it:  
---
1) Go to the root folder of wow classic (where you find the wow.exe as well as the screenshot folder and all that.).    
---
2) Make a new folder and name it: Fonts  
---
3) Now place the font-file that you prefer, in this Font-folder. Depending of whether you want ALL fonts in the game to be change  to that font you have to make 1 - 5 copies of the font-file.  
---
4) Last step is to rename the font-files to the follow:  
---
FRIZQT__.ttf (the main UI font - NPC names, player names, spell names, item names, buffs, quest log text, combat text, button text)  
---
ARIALN.ttf (chat font, info text, small text)  
---
skurri.ttf (default unit frame combat text)  
---
MORPHEUS.ttf (mail text, quest log header text)  
---
FRIENDS.ttf (friends list text)  
---
   
---
And that's it. Hopefully it can help you read text in game more clearly. There is plenty of webites where you can download all kinds of different fonts for free.  
---
For example https://www.1001fonts.com/ or https://www.dafont.com/

&gt;Yes, mouseovers work for Raidframes and the actual character model itself

This addon should do the health percents.

I remember seeing an addon for the character portraits, but I can't find it now, sorry.

Mid way through wrath. Catch up gear, lfg, split difficulties for raids. It was already going in the wrong direction then so I quit.
---
just use the best shot/arrows you can get for your level. they're all available from a vendor (engineers can craft slightly better bullets) and none of them have any additional effects beyond "+N dps"
---
/cast [target=mouseove SpellName; SpellName
---
will allow you to cast on mouseover while still functioning as a targeted spell.

You spell it iupiter

There's always that one guy that keeps posting stuff from Reddit that everyone else has obviously seen too
---
HOLY SHIT!!!! That was AMAZING!!
---
I cried like a little girl.
---
TY so much for this.
---
That’s right and that’s why I will be raiding as an arcane mage tank and nobody can tell me otherwise.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Vxn8o8o](https://imgur.com/a/Vxn8o8o) you have no idea
---
wow Livestreamfail is growing? probably because of that Korean girl clips spam.
---
Oh wow thanks for so much detail! I can't help but ask why no mention of Shaman? Are they a bad class or do you have little experience/knowledge of it?
---
Thinking about it, retail died with the Trial of the Crusader raid for me
---
 You shouldn't shop a lot in the AH but in my opinion buying stuff from the AH can be well worth it. Sometimes you find real bargains. People will often sell greens for not much over the vendor price. Buying those you are not losing much money since when you vendor it you will get most of it back.
---
 Also as a melee class spending a little more gold if you are stuck without a leveling appropriate weapon can be a good idea unless you have a weapon available soon via a quest or will play in a dungeon( obviously kill speed not important then). For casters a wand is good to buy.
---
 Another thing buying an item in the AH every now and then just makes the leveling more fun. It really doesn't matter much for your total gold amount unless you go crazy. Will having 20g less or whatever at level 60 really be a huge blow? You will not even notice it.
---
Turn back before it’s too late!
---
Why the hellfire can you post your battle chest guides while my post gets deleted for "showing game guides"?
---
Got my classic guide as well from back then. Lots of mats and advice like "Take lag into consideration while playing BG"
---
/salute
---
We can explain it but we cant understand it for you but dont worry Battle for Azeroth is still a thing if Classic isnt your cup of tea.
---
Yeah this really should be the advert for classic wow
---
Stay away from my brack rotus
---
Once Alterac Valley opens for you, run that battleground and grind rep. They offer the best ammo around outside of professions.
---
Also, weapon choice will affect ammo consumption greatly. Fast weapons will use more ammo, statistically you'll see more crits, but they'll be smaller. Also, a higher fire rate helps mitigate misses. A slower weapon uses less ammo, hits and crits harder, but you'll see fewer crits overall.
---
I recommend a slow weapon, crossbows being a good one, for pve. For pvp, higher rate of fire is best.
---
I played consistently Vanilla through BC. I immediately quit off a few months into wotlk, and I've played every xpac after that with the same pattern. Play 4-6 months, quit til next xpac. Biggest difference was in the more recent xpacs, I always felt inclined to do my dailys and it felt like a job. 
---
In Vanilla/BC, we always found something to do. It was extremely rare we were bored. We also went out and sought content instead of doing stupid daily grinds every day.
---
*Equip: Lose 1 gold per sec.*
---
Details! on retail WoW went from a pretty hardcore raider type addon to overtaking them all because it's features are so great.
---
I just switched to their nameplates as well, Plater which are just amazing. I hope Plater works on Classic but Details does for sure.
---
Feel like talent trees are useless in vanilla considering a lot of specs were useless back then
---
&gt; /r/classicwow is really turning into /r/wow, with low efford memes and art
---
I fear this is the price we pay for success and popularity.
---
Venruki is one of my favorite streamers because he's pretty damn chill, and has minimal arrogance unlike a lot of the other really good players.
---
It will bring the MMO back to wow!
---
It's why I quit. I can't imagine how bad it is now if they kept going like they did in cataclysm, which is when I quit.
---
Not true, it doesn’t have any threat modifier at all, it’s just that warlocks don’t have any threat reducing abilities or talents.
---
You never know man they might just open it early. If we don't continue to press that button no one will know.
---
You probably play a blood elf female in retail
---
Warriors are sort of the definitive tanks in Classic, but then you are shoehorning yourself into only Tanking if you don't like DPS.
---
Druids are great at tanking 5/10 man dungeons, but really fall off when it comes to Raids. Druid healing is viable, but the demand is very low due to Heal Over Time spells not stacking on a target.
---
Shaman are amazing group healers and provide a lot of support to groups. 
---
If I were to make a suggestion of the 3, it would be Shaman.
---
This is so true!
---
why are you posting this here? you think the utter noob that is the average cwow reddit user is gonna even begin to understand this?
---
Ah yes! Lol I hope they do remain the same.
---
You're still constantly ignoring my point and now are trying to shift the burden of proof onto me. This is going nowhere. Take care.
---
I play a warrior.. and i blink every couple of seconds... dry eyes suck
---
They haven't deleted the characters or names for that matter. I still have my 4 names on one account.
---
Similar deal with Orc. You can jump that back wall near graveyard at char creation and swim to Booty Bay's boat in like 4 minutes
---
How can you guys even think this is done by blizz?
---
Don't stress over it. Level as arms or fury and you'll still be able to tank dungeons. No need to be prot while leveling.
---
Make a macro that marks the enemy you're targeting, that way your group will focus DPS on that mob so it's easier for you to keep agro. If you tank a few dungeons on the way to 60 you'll learn most things you need to know.
---
Bro you can turn off world pvp.
---
It's directly related to the speed of the game and the direction it took.
---
Why arent yoy worried about faction balance on herod?
---
Classic might not need that much just to run normally, but running the game in crowded areas in 4k will definitely increase your ram usage. 
---
The CPU and motherboard upgrade is part of the reason I suggested you save up and do a bigger upgrade later. That is really going to be the limiting factor for your rig unfortunately.  You might be able to get the game running in 4k, but your experience will probably be very sluggish. 
---
GPU wise, the 970 can get 4k sometimes if you tune things right, but it struggles. I’ve personally been looking into an RTX 2070 myself for the same reason. But getting a newer card that’s really capable of running 4k games well might kill your budget completely. 
---
Tldr: You should save your money and do a bigger upgrade later. Theres not much point in 4k gaming if you can only render it at 20 fps. You’ll want it to play as beautiful as it looks! Good luck, my friend.
---
Oh, it would be a dream if I could lock the game at 60 FPS to meet my TVs refresh rate, I thought that’s not achievable with my CPU and dropped that. I’d be very happy with an average framerate of above 30 all the way to 60, 40 would be fine at 4K with as much graphical details as possible. 
---
The budget for a used card would be up to 100$, or € in my case (which shouldn’t be much of a difference when it comes to used hardware). 80€ would get me a used GTX 970 here in Germany, to compare prices.
---
WTF?
---
They will.
---
It's ACTIVISION Blizzard we are talking about here. There is no way they will resist exploiting millions of players.
---
If you think they will never add microtransactions you are simply delusional.
---
lol yea, if the paladin is good that bomb won't even hurt, it will be instant.
---
End of Wrath/beginning of Cata
---
This is good, cant wait to kill gnomes now lol
---
??????????????????????????????????????????? have you done the Southshore brawl? It's a lagfest with 40v40. At some point it's on the server's end and not the client. That's a perfect example.
---
I recently leveled a paladin to 60, it was really boring 40-50.
---
Also I get rekt hard by shamans in tier 2 by 2k shocks.
---
You quit at like the best time!
---
I hope classic brings you just as many great memories now as it did back then. And hey maybe you can get in touch with some of your dad's old friends and maybe play classic with them. Although I would understand if they were a bit on the older side and didn't want to play anymore lol. It is addicting.
---
Level gathering professions for your first character.  Crafting is useful while leveling, but it’s expensive.  I’d recommend skinning and mining.  Vendor the skins.  It all adds up.  Sell the ore on the AH.  You should be set for your 40 mount.
---
# howtooltip didn't work on Stress for me. I know it wasn't a thing back in Classic so I thought "Well, guess they kept that away from the game like everyone tells them"
---
Slow death during Wrath. Cataclysm was an abomination.
---
Eh, I'm enjoying myself by practicing leveling on a private server. Trying to make all my mistakes there before launch.
---
It’s just a conversion but aye, still neat
---
I personally am still running windows 7. Only recently started having even slight issues with it. Classic runs just fine. Next pc upgrade probably includes windows 10 though.
---
Wonder if there’s going to be the back and forth battles between southshore and tarren mill again.
---
Yea stop educating yourself idiots.
---
This guy etymologys
---
I mean his 4 paragraph post has one sentence that relates to WoW, and the rest is about Overwatch. Not sure how that relates to my attention span.
---
These are from Fiverr and can be purcahsed lol Whores
---
Try saying that on an investor call
---
Lol acting like wow players have sex. U funny
---
Try getting passed by the healer on the meter. 
---
Really. Ret Paladin was bad until geared and even then... sadness.
---
I can enjoy the sweltering heat and humidity until all of my sweat has left my body through my ass cheeks.
---
Maybe in your magical world where everything is a 1v1 and you always attack first.  Reality is different. 
---
Orc is the only choice for anyone even half serious about PVP.
---
Troll is fine if you want to min max PVE, but if you're doing that why aren't you Alliance.
---
I've been playing through 1-3 in anticipation. I'm scrambling to finish 'The Frozen Throne' by next Monday; I've never beaten it before.
---
It's too exciting!
---
Is this the same guys that had the guild "Washed up" on a few TBC servers?

---
Lots of games with top notch graphics look dull and uninspired. WoW's old graphics still look very vibrant and good. There is equal attention in detail to everything and even low poly/low res textures look better than some brand new games.
---
yes but they said todays medium on the classic servers equals or is more than the full servers back in 2006
---
Did you just blow in from stupid town?
---
Joana = Hunter = Aspect of the Cheetah
---
Every fight and raid comp is different, but it’s not uncommon to see ret under 1/3 or 1/4 of top DPS.
---
Wanna play so bad but 10 years later, with job and kids, I just can’t :(.
---
Yeah because it's the semi official 3rd party resource.  Of course they wouldn't have a Classic section before it was announced.
---
For me it was honestly just the loss of the sandbox/adventure feel of the zones. The streamlined story was nice but it's like a ride on rails and can get boring after a little while.
---
My first char was an arms war in vanilla. Gear was harder yes, but survivability was great and once I hit 60 I could actually beat rogues thanks to mortal strike!
---
I just settled with Enema
---
The same thing happens in OSRS. Scammers make a killing on that game hacking peoples accounts using Facebook/Reddit ads.
---
I just tried 3 different games (Fire Emblem, Magicka 2 and Diablo) and I just stop playing after an hour. I can't wait anymore!!!
---
Yup, and I bet he has a crew he regularly rolls with as well as a few others hes fine to roll with when they aren't available.  Like a lot of MMO's you get very attached to your crew, but the difference is you end up doing things socially along side the game cause they are physically there.  Community run events are like mini parties cause you see a buncha old friends you used to play with.
---
It's basically impossible not to have a social life if you are active in that game, and I think it becomes a huge part of the will to keep going.  It was for me when I played it.
---
&gt; The average dungeon meta
---
Can you elaborate on what this means?
---
I did consider skinning as Mage is one of those classes that can solo Devilsaurs. Which is a very AFK method really due to waiting on spawns. 
---
What are your thoughts on Druid? In terms of farming potential compared to mage.
---
What about focus dump macros to speed up the rate at which they autocast bite?
---
For example, on retail I have bite macro'd to my main rotation abilities.
---
BC is still best period of wow. Even &gt;vanilla
---
&gt; Spellshock Leggings
---
never seen one, played vanilla  for years.. they are rarer than Thunderfury
---
What part of the (first) world even jokes that Americans are all rich?
---
I would describe myself as a casual player.  I actually liked the game from vanilla through cataclysm, because the game was easier then, IMO. 
---
Starting at around MoP onwards it became a confusing clusterfuck with titanforging, scaling, excessive time gating, confusing talents and where do glyphs go, etc.
---
From polls I saw the faction Balance was pretty dang even because all the good alliance pvpers want to pvp against the best horde ones. However, theres no way of knowing unless blizzard releases stats
---
So you think 80 bucks for a used 970 might not work out with classic in 4K? And only classic, I really don’t plan on playing anything else on that system. 
---
Or maybe just spend 50 bucks for a new GPU and be happy with 60fps at 1080p/max?
---
**Oh come on we all know the population on all servers will drop by 70-90% after the hype is over, so if you want to progress your character in resnable time frame, you need to be on the highest populated server.**
---
Maybe after lvl 30. I wanna be as retro as possible. No addons. No guides for the first couple days
---
It’s a me
---
Where can I find useful hunter/general addons for the WoW Classic that is coming out? The sites I have found are for private servers.
---
Damn christmas came early this year.
---
Or not a complaining pussy who can take care of myself ;)
---
Tried both, pvp is far superior in classic.
---
A medium pop server now has more people than a full server in vanilla. Total pop isn't my concern mostly . I'd prefer my pvp servers to be balanced if poss
---
My one suggestion would be to prioritize your CPU over GPU. WoW is actually a more CPU intensive game.
---
During phase 2, you can expect there to be pretty massive organized pvp gatherings of all types. Everyone will be pushing hard to rank up as much as possible.
---
Throw in a 12oz dew and he will
---
All other games suck, so it's not a surprise.
---
I played pservers. Using a guide and quest helper made it feel like retail to me. It sucked so much fun and excitement out of the game. Many might not feel this way but it made the game so much less fun. It didn't feel like I was exploring an open world and making my own decisions as it should feel. If you want to truly enjoy classic, do your own thing. You don't need to level THAT fast. There is a small group of try hards who are going to level that quickly, most will take a longer time to get to 60 because they want to thoroughly enjoy the leveling process.
---
Spellret is a dead meme. It was founded on the hope that all the consumables, items and spells like shadow oils, dragon breath chili, seal of righteousness etc. behave and scale exactly the same as they do on private servers. Turns out they don't. It was absurd to asumme that in the first place but people really wanted to live the ret dream. But some dreams stay memes.
---
What if my girlfriend only likes me when I dress up like Legolas? Am I shit out of luck?
---
A lot of that has to do with Modern WoW spells it's been said by the devs a few times so that's not a very good basis tbh. Modern WoW has lots of procs and RNG elements that bog down the server where vanilla didn't have an abundance of it.
---
I think MC bosses are a good choice. No faction bias, and it's an early raid which gives more mystique to the end game. Puts more focus on the adventurer.
---
Can't wait to pvp grief wetlands and grave camp!
---
Ah the good old days!
---
Was in a tank in a Top 15 US guild during all of classic and had like 2% of that.
---
WoW Vanilla was already the casual game appealing to a wide audience.  That's why it was popular over other MMORPG's at the time.  Then they ruined it by "streamlining" it to an extreme degree in favor of maintaining financial reporting numbers.  To call WoW Vanilla "hardcore" is silly, but that's the way it seems compared to the monstrosity that is Modern WoW.
---
There were a few guys who had been there before
---
and you had a credit card...?
---
Never ever, in any game without HUGE amounts of RNG will a casual team beat a pro team.
---
I could see a casual player beating a pro in Hearthstone, TFT etc...
---
I didn't mean anywhere specifically, just to claim that using nostalgia as a negative term is by no means new to Classic WoW.
---
That's just not accurate at all.
---
Nah, I know him, he makes those sounds irl
---
FFXIV is honestly the worst mmorpg I've ever played. You'd think after the glory of 11 they'd have something good, but it got turned into a special interest freak box.
---
Beautiful. 10 days to go!
---
The gnome looks more like him than that picture lmao
---
I think they don't belong in the game. Horde are meant to look rough and the Blood Elves kill this vibe. Same with Draenei - they don't belong in Vanilla.
---
Online forums are the only place I’ve ever seen anyone bitch about being the wrong race/class combo.
---
Wrath was the point where the game transformed from an RPG into a daily-fest. TBC had dailies, but they were mostly pointless for anything but mounts/tabards and nowhere near as integral to gameplay as they became in Wrath where most things were propped up by them.
---
Wrath also saw homogenisation of classes and gear and amplified the idea of "welfare epics", where every single player would run around in full epics and not just raiders/dedicated PvPers. The open world was easier; grouping was less essential, there were no "dangerous" areas that you tackled on foot and encouraged to group for, but you were instead given overpowered vehicles to crush leagues of creatures. Speaking of which - Wrath had an obsession with vehicles and they were *not* fun. The frustrations of fights like Malygos, Oculus and Flame Leviathan because so many people simply did not know what anything outside of their core class skills did!
---
Chat is best part of this.
---
The Willhelm scream lol
---
Risking their entire sub pop doing so.
---
People are underestimating the q times lol
---
That's exactly what I've been looking for 🤗
---
Thank you sir for the reminder, Just got my name :)
---
So you're mad because Wowhead kept up with the only official version of the game instead of freezing in time and staying in whatever expansion you like best?
---
Nah I’m pretty sure goblin tech would somehow manage to blow up the past. Infinite dragonflight ain’t got shit on goblins.
---
Best way would be you could copy a character over to tbc realms once, that way vanilla purists are happy and you don't have to start fresh and it feels like an organic expansion experience.
---
Uuuuuuuuuuuh what a badass idea! 
---
Ill copy that
---
Use a Î instead
---
&gt; Also, resist the temptation to buy common (grey) items from vendors in your starting zones. 
---
You should absolutely buy weapon upgrades from the vendors if you're a weapon reliant class at least very early on. Those couple silvers don't make much difference but the increase in kill speed absolutely does.

Me and my guild are planning to join the Syndicate. We will have to kill 2k Ravenholdt units and will become neutral with Syndicate. Which means that we can freely roam in Durnholde keep which will be our base of operations and will train RP and invade from there. I'm hoping to plan some events with other guilds too, like them raiding us and so on.
---
I for one am glad the systems implemented over the years are in place. It makes it way more fun for me, maybe having the time to only play an hour max each evening. Vanilla was fun too, but the improvements are just that's improvements, atleast in my eyes.
---
Unpopular opinion (maybe?) the fetish with naming characters is weird to me. Sites to buy/sell/trade names? It's just weird, if your name is unavailable just pick a different one.
---
Wowclassicbis.com, it has quite some flaws tho. Take it with a grain of salt

Don't bother replying to Felplague dude. Massive Blizzard shill on here and MMO Champion. Best to just block them and move on tbh.
---
Let's make the worse spec possible. *Goes straight to the Retribution tree*
---
But that gets you know where. 
---
Back then played end game 6 days a week with a pretty good guide but you had to put the time into it to become that well oiled team
---
TPS wise you arn't getting closer to the fury build than with AM+Impale specc and still maintaining defensive specc. Farming wise I dunno, i just usually respecc full DPS and farm for an extra hour so I don't go back on the gold :P
---
I would love an alternative timeline done "right" akin to TBC which only added more of the good stuff (debatable to some) that was Vanilla, while following Classic rules like no LFD, no extreme casualization, more class depth, etc.
---
Made my own wow sounds playlist on Spotify
---
When Dire maul opens up you can farm the lashers even as holy it's easy. At least on pservers should be about the same or even better on classic.
---
It’s not removed, I still see it.
---
In classic you have to go back to your class trainer to reset talent points, costs an increasing amount of gold each time. It's not like retail where you'll change your spec on a dungeon by dungeon basis. You'll choose a talent set up and stick to it for a while, but with certain talent builds you can fulfil multiple roles to varying degrees.
---
Seeing this makes me want to play warcraft 3, which makes me want to play Dota 2, which then makes me want to play Dota Underlords. I get bored of that after several games, then I am back on this Sub... then I see a video like this.

This is madness.
---
This was the problem. Without a subscription, the installer is not available. By default, [battle](https://battle.net)net lets you install the starter edition. I added a subscription and it appeared right away.  
---
FWIW - would be nice if I could have installed the game, then activated my subscription the day of release.
---

---
In all honest, for that price, 970 is not a bad way to go. WoW at 30FPS is not going to be a bad experience by any means and will get you through for the time being.
---
You could always check local market places like Facebook or Craiglist, some people are just trying to offload their old hard ware in order to supplement their new purchase. 
---
I for one, back in January, got an Asus Strix 1070 for $200 (usd) and it was only used to boot up twice. The guy decided he didn't want to go through with a full build and needed to make back some money from his purchases. Sure, I lucked out, but online market places have a lot of hidden gems.
---
Unrelated, but just today, my wife and I bought a Lovesac - Supersac for $100 from someone down the street. Not only do they retail for $1000, but it has some sort of limited edition cover on it that sells for $600 alone, and is very lightly used.

Well only way US servers don't get queues in phase 2 is if more than 50% of the population leaves then. Imo, that ain't happening.
---
Is this going to get posted every day until launch?
---
I loved it back in the day when someone bought their toon or had someone else level it. You would see them in bgs and they had no idea what to do. Now a days though... they likely played on servers during this down time and know the class. Either way, you are cheating yourself if you dont level yourself. Just saying.
---
That's extremely strange...
---
You get what I'm getting at, right?
---
Blizzard said that populations would be completely decimated after launch due to launch hype and tourists leaving, so they implemented layer sharding to stop login queues and to have servers "shrink" to normal size by phase 2 (when all layer sharding is removed).
---
But now they're saying that not only will there be login queues (which I'm ok with) but there may be over massive populations of 10k during phase 2?
---
Seems extremely contradictory. Here's hoping servers reach healthy (smaller) sizes like they expect, with lots of people quitting.
---
That seems to be the way things are turning out. In the long run, Herod will be the most populated server, but it's also probably going to be the most toxic and hardcore oriented. That's fine if that's what you want of course, but I'm more than happy being on the filthy casual pvp server.
---
Nah, they will just add fast queue.   For $25.00 a month you go to the front of the login queue.
---
There’s no money in RTS so blizzard has no incentive. WoW has monthly subs; OverWatch and HearthStone have micro transactions. An RTS nets Blizzard a flat $60 — their other franchises easily double the money they get from players. You just got to be real about how business works and how Blizzards CFO is going to best allocate spending for the best Return on Investment for the shareholders. 
---
You won’t see a new RTS for years, if ever, Warcraft 3 Reforged is just a pretty remake, it cost way down on production costs. Starcraft 3 or Warcraft 4 would be a major monetary investment for Blizzard and the company is floundering at the moment.
---
Sure it is.  It means the player base is not as big as it once was.  Investors don't like that.
---
Then it is likely they will plan for BC and have a combo of vanilla and progression servers over time.
---
No I’m role playing a girl
---
There wont be any low or medium pop servers
---
World of Diablo.
---
We love you anyway, Sharon.
---
Do you really think 50% will quit though? What is there, like 30 layers in a server? That will still be way to many people at phase 2 and people will need to change servers.
---
, yeah we get it "orange man bad" "cheeto dust" move along and go post about politics somewhere else thanks

Thanks but that tool cannot show the best possible items when lvl 36 or 44 foreample

You are seem to just randomly be mashing things that seem appealing to you together in longing.... most of your post is pointless rambling.
---
Classic will be good, the genre was already taking steps toward returning to older style design, this is a good step for the community overall. Classic will not be for everyone and in the big picture classic was actually very flawed, but all of the content and experiences were meaningful for guilds as a whole as a community.
---
Your post is painful to read as an MMO veteran who started with UO..... it is quite clear you are only regurgitating points and issues you have never experienced only read about.
---
It's good that classic is coming out but honestly it would be better if a completely new MMO with similar designs in mind was created. 
---
Part of the charm with classic was that it was new and no one knew anything about it. Now classic has been completely figured out, min maxed etc.
---
Classic had many faults which TBC and WoTLK fixed, some argue that WoTLK is where things started to go downhill despite highest sub count.
---
Honeymoon period will end and people will realise these faults in classic.
---
WoW 2 would be the way to go IMO, with classic/TBC design in mind. That way problems in classic would be polished and refined, and it would be a completely new world to explore which is what a lot of classic players want. 
---
For retail players who never played classic or people from other mmos who didn't play classic it will be really cool for them. But for those who experienced classic before the nostalgia will fade fast IMO and it will get boring quick.
---
Speaking for me: Because I already did it so many times and it's just not fun at this point. Low level chars are fucking boring you don't have your spells and your skills. Playing a war under 40 is just awful because you don't have the main skill that makes your gameplay a bit dynamic (mortal strike or bloodthirst).  
---
I don't enjoy leveling at all, I love the game at max level. So yeah, there is that. Sorry to not be like you I guess ?
---
They're not bad, they just farm differently.
---
Mage is really good at farming huge packs of mobs in a small area.
---
Druid is really good at farming single mobs over a large area.
---
Assuming you take the AH out of the equation, Mage is more efficient because it can kill more mobs faster, which gives more loot to vendor.
---
But say something like Evil Bat Eyes (https://classicdb.ch/?item=11404#dropped-by) suddenly jump in price due to the release of Darkmoon Faire. They only drop from bats in EPL, which are spread over a large area and can't really be AoE farmed very efficiently. Druids will be able to kill them faster than Mages due to their innate movement speed and less downtime between kills.
---
That's just one example, there's plenty of different farming spots with various loot tables. And depending on current AH prices those spots may be better than AoE farming DM:E with a Mage.
---
Do you mean the Highborne?
---
aoe SM down and charge attendies a reasonable fee.
---
They have the ability to make a server infinitely big, they just don't want to do that because then it'll be a shitshow when they turn layering off. There's a cap in order to encourage people to spread out.
---
My hope is that 3-4 months in they free up the names that haven’t been logged in for almost all of classic.
---
Yea, for me, and it sounds like a lot of other people too, it's not the fact that there's a rep wall: it's that the only way to do it is via boring ass world quests at max level. Gone are the days of tabard use in dungeons and stuff
---
It'll still bring the servers to their knees.
---
Blizz is not shelling out tons of cash for top of the line dedicated hardware for this lol.
---
No, because you can't.

Wait, I thought no man's sky was dead on arrival?

Warlocks can farm Maraudon which is a 60g/h farm.
---
and it's completely free to participate in! 
---
It will only cost your entire life.

Shadow priest would improve the warlocks damage. I'm leveling a shaman with my wife's warlock. I'm sure it doesn't matter though.

Hundreds of people will still bring the server to it's knees.

There is no such thing as "WPVP" And leveling partner. As soon as you diddle another player your quest goes from taking 10minutes to 45minutes.

Okay. I don't see any data that would show there will be a drop off, but o can see your point.

Thank you for detailed and fast responses!

What's the best threat generating build?
---
!remindMe 1337 days
---
1. Only one Mage is going to farm Hydraxian rep and just port in and get summoned back for the douses. 
---
2. Only the tanks need FR in MC. The rest of the damage is 100% healable even in greens/blues.
---
3. Shield Wall, Last Stand, Lay on Hands, etc all make it more than possible to tank through Mags enrage. Healers are a lot better than they were 15 years ago. Nevermind accounting for the dialup internet and slow computers back then.
---
4. You only need some Greater Fire Protection Potions on the raid for Rag, any extras are just a plus for a full clear. Of course the tanks will need to get as much as possible. 
---
5. Rag will be dead within 10 days of launch at ABSOLUTE max, probably more in the realm of 6-8 days.
---
Lol. r/wow
---
All the major cities had AHs. It was just the case that they weren't linked together originally, so people chose one city to make the main AH.
---
yeah this is true
---
how often in pvp do you just get to stand in the same spot to reap the benefits of berserk? stun resist way better for pvp. not even close

---
It lost alot of charm and RPG feel with the new talents for sure. It did however add another layer to raiding and made them much more relevant at max level overall. Old talents were basically spec and forget while the new talents is much more dynamic.
---
In retail there is usually 3 specs within a spec, singel target, AoE and easy to play. Sometimes depending on the fight or dungeon a certain spec is better than the other and often it completely change gameplay. 
---
I can honestly say the new talents is without a doubt better but god do i miss the old ones. Sometimes feel is much more important than any other potential benefit.
---
With a shield its AM+Impale imo but overall the fury build is a lot more TPS but u need gear for it
---
alts are just trustfund babies
---
Gehennas*
---
I wouldn't recommend warrior as your first character simply because they are rather difficult to level and VERY gear dependant. If you plan to play on a PvP server, you will also be a training dummy for others to kill. Repair bills are also high and you're not going to have much money on your first character, especially as a new player.
---
Shaman and druid both have spells that grant them increased movement speed for travel, can heal themselves and can manage to kill mobs even when out of mana. Both are also desired in groups (though shamans more so). Keep in mind that if you plan on raiding, shaman is considered to be mainly a healer in raids, but elemental shaman is considered to be very good in PvP. Druid is a viable healer, tank as a feral bear and dps as a feral cat and also excels in PvP. The balance tree is kind of poop, though, so if you want to be a pure ranged dps - pick another class.
---
How accurate is this though?
---
A pet with a faster melee and a low focus cost dump will be throwing out attacks far more often than a slower melee pet with focus abilities that are expensive or have a cooldown. I don't know why none of the guides ever mention it but the real reason is the BM talent frenzy. The more often your pet crits, the higher uptime you'll have on frenzy.
---
The people that would ban based on it never find themselves in a position to do so. Having an unlikable personality is far more of a detriment to any group or guild than some paltry performance increase.
---
You can play WoW Music until then, I don't know if it makes the waiting better or worse.

Awesome! Thank you so much! Really helps narrow this down!
---
bro they are releasing new diablo season like 4 days before classic release... makes me cry really
---
Just wait until the 25 and re-sub. The game is &lt;5GB so it won't be a big deal to just install the day before.
---
I'm so happy to not be forced into melee hunter
---
Torn a bit between Mage, Priest, and Shaman so I was hoping that some recommendations here would be the tie-breaker
---
I dont know which i miss and am worried about more... STV gank squads, or the never ending gank fest in Hillsbrad
---
Using SH to compare...lol. On ND Rag was dead in 8 or 10 days, it will be faster on Classic I'm sure. No one prepared for private server launches as much as they are for the real deal. Any good leveler, Warrior or not will be under 60 in 5 days /played with a good route. Most melee will level in duo/trio groups, etc.
---
Using SH as a reference is just a joke. None of the veteran Vanilla players played there past level 10 really, it's a bunch of freshies and chinese/russians.

God no, it’ll just take all of the fun away. IMO classic is about the journey, Wpvp and social aspect, raiding and PvP is done better in many other games
---

---
I'm far from a financial expert so absolutely feel free to correct me here, but wouldn't Activision being the parent company and expecting Blizz to hit certain #s, and then leaning on them to do so, affect all the operations in Blizzard even though they are only meeting a couple times a year?
---
Where was Arthas? He was the main character of TFT and just disappears.
---
UNLESS, he meant trinket as an adjective, like when people say “what an absolute unit”.
---
I do agree on your points and like to my two cents. 
---
I don’t like the whole narrative of: “you are the chosen one” This feels off for an mmo and would fit better in a single player game. It’s killing the vibe for me, you are the one and only to do that quest. You are just as special as literally everyone else who isn’t an npc. 
---
 I only have vague memories left on most vanilla quest lines, was relatively young at the time, but I don’t feel like that in classic you were the chosen / special one.
---
But do correct me if I am wrong. At
---
Devs HATE him
---
I would argue slow weapon is better for PvP as well because it increases your burst damage from multi and aimed shot.  Also, when you're kiting, you have more space between autos and therefore have to stop less to fire to obtain optimal damage while kiting.  
---
TLDR: Slow bows with equal DPS are always better.
---
Lovely machines! Can you still play the game in MacOS or are you also forced to Windows 10?
---
There’s always going to be people leveling. 
---
The only thing you will miss is phase 1, which is fine, because people will still continue to do phase 1 things even during phase 2 and 3.
---
i think what killed it in the end for me was that community didn't matter anymore. in vanilla and bc you knew the top ppl of most of the top guilds, you knew who had the extra rare recipes and getting to the dungeons was already part of the adventure
---
i understand why they put in the qol changes to increase the audience. but removing the barriers also made it quite bland.
---
Yeah it's totally worth it. Less craze more immersion imo
---
You got 2 fingers mate
---
If only this was posted somewhere that people interested specifically in Thalnos could go read it...
---
Depends on the company. Blizzard still use Alpha and Beta correctly for WoW and CIG do for Star Citizen. It's mainly EA that have been guilty of that pre-alpha shit.  
---
I don't know what's worse, that they call a demo "pre-alpha" or that people still fall for it.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LhhxzhbZcZxizoeMzVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LhhxzhbZcZxizoeMzVo) this is the specc you wanna go for max TPS while being Tank specced.
---
There's no way we can know that yet though =) just bold assumptions. Classic is a different beast compared to BfA its not nearly as complex. So we'll see in time how it plays out.
---
No. Activision *Publishing*, which is what the vast majority of people know as simply Activision, is not the [holding company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company) (not the parent company, which is slightly different, see link), Activision-Blizzard is. The name confuses people, but they’re completely different entities in the org. Blizzard Entertainment and Activision Publishing (as well as King and their smaller BUs) have their own internal financial staff for game performance and sales metrics, who set them themselves internally in each unit. Activision-Blizzard, the holding company, then handles the financial reporting for investors and the stock market and aggregates each units’ financial performance into the single [quarterly financial report](https://investor.activision.com/static-files/a8c34cbe-87f1-48a3-9da3-9b343cdfe43c) for the whole Activision-Blizzard holding company. 
---
Blizzard Entertainment, as a BU within Activision-Blizzard, actually on average pulls in more revenue than Activision Publishing, so if either unit is gonna have more weight to push around, it would be Blizzard Entertainment. Though in reality they more than likely work collaboratively, as you would want to, pushing other BUs around does not end well for internal company relations more often than not.
---
Fishing.
---
less competition for mobs
---
Do you mean that it's updated but you just haven't released it to the public yet?
---
You can PvP when you choose to, once BG's arrive. That's the whole appeal for those of us who go for PvE realms. We like choosing what to do, when we want to.
---
There is no 'true' experience because PvE realms existed in 2004 and had no trouble filling its realms.
---
Oof, pretty sure this will be shared between some blizzard employees and ion not understanding why people are smiling at him while walking through the office.

Ugh man, you dont wanna compromise and go shaman do you? You gotta go all the way in either direction. Never half-ass it!
---
Unless youre on US servers. Then idc.
---
Shadowform is not nearly as important to leveling as wand spec and spirit tap. You can max those by lvl 19.
---
it is not a "bad" idea but perhaps the not optimal. While beastmaster is solid I would suggest you go marksman as soon as your can get scatter shot (lvl30). At low level fights doesnt last so long , so being able to scatter shot &gt; fd &gt; trap &gt; go range again is the best thing you have. Also Aimed shot damage is really good.
---
I think that this is because most MMOs tend to 100% ignore the social aspect of these games. WoW did kinda put social interactions on the back burner but still managed to create a social environment by simply developing a MMO in a time where MMOs were still designed around being social. Players wanted to group up and help each other because the world was tough.
---
All the "WoW killers" completely missed the mark and just went with the new shit that blizz introduced with WoW (which happened to be all the shit that made MMOs less sociable) so you get a game that has the same mechanics as WoW but none of the magic because no one ever interacts with each other unless they absolutely have to.
---
Facts. The funny thing is this community actually DOES call the Blizz team fucking idiots regularly, so we know its true.
---
Except every thing but your anecdote for optimal leveling, even just to 15, states to get the imp. It does more dmg than you (for a while), gives you better tagging abilities + stam. Like I leveled a paladin during the last stress test to 15 in like 6.5 hours just doing elwyn + westfall and having to compete for mobs. A WL should do it in 6 hours easy not 9.5
---
Retribution paladin
---
There's no real catch up mechanic in Classic WoW the same way there is in retail WoW. No content is obsolete. It doesn't hurt starting late, guilds will still be running the early raids every week.
---
Yeah thanks for an easy explanation
---
I’m rolling female Orc.  Wife is rolling make Tauren. We might RP...
---
will my 1080 be ok?
---
For pvp do you want a slower harder hitting weapon or a faster weapon?
---
I'm on an rp server. I totally want to join a cult guild now. Gonna have to rework my backstory now.
---
this is some low effort shit posting bruh
---
But he’s carrying a 2 hander?
---
Ya'll go out and speed level that shit while ima take my time and enjoy it!
---
It's not a popular opinion but I really don't like wow pvp, I can't help but feel it's just clunky and awkward. I was on a pvp server from vanilla through the end of BC, in Wrath I transferred to a PVE server to play with IRL friends and I didn't miss it for even one moment. I'll be rolling PVE this time around no question.
---
I know lol... people have massive misconceptions about druids.
---
I loved seeing the same people. That was one of the great things about WoW for me, actually seeing the people you interacted with before.
---
1)Fewer people to compete with mobs while leveling. 
---
2)Once you hit 60 there will be enough 60’s that it will make it easy for you to get your best in slot gear and enough raiding guilds to pick you up easily.
---
3) there will be an economy and you can sell things to make more money while leveling. 
---
The only downside I see I you will struggle with being raked over by higher leveled players while questing but that’s the struggle of a pvp server anyway. As far as I can tell this will only work in your favor.
---
Questing is not going to happen on pvp realms.  People are just going to world pvpv until it's time to go to sleep, or they roll pve.
---
Don't even have to gank you to get the very same response out of you apparently
---
Why delete so fast?
---
Yes, it's region locked. In 2004 I lived at home in the UK, now I live in NA. Looked into it and you need to pay for 2 accounts. (My battlenet is NA for example, but I have the option to buy an EU WoW account, just not switch from my already existing NA account.)
---
I'd guess through ads on their website, yeah.
---
You’re going to want a great battery if you have to game without power.
---
They could at least make it into an Animated series.
---
That's actually not how it works, but thanks for contributing to the confusion -- especially by trying to insert random numbers as fact.
---
You miss out on the sense of danger and world immersion.
---
1) this exists in retail
---
2) maybe a little, titanforging really isn’t that much of an issue. I’d rather have that than just not get loot like in vanilla. A lot of the essence things also become “kill this boss 5 more times for your next upgrade” which is more boring than this boss has a 20% chance to drop your upgrade.
---
3) hahaha no, you want me to give up doing dungeons with other people I’ve met who are actually good players? And if I meet someone irl who plays my faction now one of us has to swap servers to play together? No thanks.
---
Seriously number 3 is probably retail players’ favorite feature. You should just consider this an irreconcilable difference.
---
Internet has very little to do with lag during large-scale pvp. Latency is what your internet connection determines, not server lag.
---
For current server ability to handle a couple raids in same place, you can queue for Ashran and observe the shitshow with just 80 players in an instanced environment (hint: it's bad and somehow not even any better than the original Ashran two expansions ago...). It will be exponentially worse in Classic with way more than 80 players in same spot. When a single raid invades a capital city, even in the current game, the whole place grinds to a halt and you have to fly to thunder bluff if you want to retrieve mail or use the AH without a 5-10 sec delay after every action.
---
Using a better CPU GPU and high speed internet, or turning off addons and setting visuals to 1 does absolutely nothing in this case since the problem is server-side.
---
No, I’m in Mojave. It has 2x 6-core 3.46ghz xeons, EVO 970 PCIe SSD, and a Vega 56. Cause why not!
---
You’re not understanding that fear ward isn’t necessary. I get it critical thinking is tough. 
---
You’re probably someone who believes the Bible can’t be wrong, cause it was written by god, how do you know that? It says so.
---
unlike current state, when you tame a beast that is low level, it stays low level at classic. So if you are lvl 60 and you want to grap a pet that is lvl 30, that pet WILL stay lvl 30, and you need to level it grinding mobs. This means it take a lot of time. So what I do and would suggest is, get the pet you want to have lvl at lvl 60 as soon as you can, but if you dont want to level with it, use two pets. your 60 pet and leveling pet swapping them every half level or so, so you level both of them.
---
Don't forget Dragonsbreath Chili!
---
I miss what Warhammer online could have been more than the game because let’s face it: we were fed so much bullshit before release and there was so much bug and concept that were rushed and not working that despite many brillant ideas, the game was far from being enjoyable (especially the closer you got to max level, early game was probably the only part that worked)
---
I hope so too, but I doubt it.
---
Take that big Tauren peen sissy boy
---
So warlocks are a bit more gear dependent then hunter &amp; mage. This is because they don't have a lot of reset utility.
---
**What's reset utility?**
---
Well that's a spell or an ability that allows the user to reset the fight pretty much.  Hunters have their feign death and mages have their aoe slows and snares. Warlocks don't really have a reset utility.
---
**But that doesn't mean you can farm!**
---
Warlocks still have very powerful potential to farm. They can farm tyrs, they can farm maurodon, They can aoe farm ZF, lord incendious
---
And the later the phases go.. the more power you actually get. Realistically warlock is one of three classes that can start to solo dungeons on their own. They have an extremely powerful endgame when it's nax &amp; probably tie with warrior for strongest endgame.
---
For dungeons this would work fine, not ideal. But fine. Though for raids not so much.

Harry is such a wallflower in the best way
---
an actual shot of screen
---
Its not vanilla wow without susan express.
---
Priests level very fast/efficiently even before shadow form because of spirit tap.
---
Cat form doesn't seem worth playing a handicapped class during end game.
---
Shamans get a lot of raid spots because of chain heal and totems even though they aren't as high hps as priests.
---
How many quivers should I use? Do the passives stack, and is it worth using more than 1 or 2 of them?
---
Because of the gear progression difference, I won’t be able to get into PvP am I correct?
---
Anyone who doesn't min/max is a shill for blizzard trying to make noobs choices seem workable.  Nice try, Blizzard.
---
No it isn't, it informs you of relative time to level from one level to the next. Also gives you info on precisely where certain points are (1/4, 1/2,. 3/4s). There's a ton of info here just people don't either a) want to or b) just don't understand what the chart is trying to inform on so they shit on it.
---
You get the quest right away, not the imp until quest is complete. Level 1-5 is a cakewalk for any class.
---
What do you mean craze
---
I don't really think the removal of talent trees was what simplified the game though. Most classes had a cookie cutter build that everyone copied, usually maxing out one of the trees and then putting 10 points into one of the other two. Talents like 1% more parry per point with 5 points to max the talent also didn't really feel impactful at all. I'd rather have the retail talent system, because i feel like choosing 1 of 3 impactful abilities that can change the playstyle of the class is just more fun than the old system where i had to put 20 points into passives to get an actual active ability in deathwish on a warrior for example. The only thing that sucks with the retail talents is the spacing. Getting something good every 15 levels and then nothing for the 14 in between is as boring as putting points into the 1% crit talent on a classic warrior.  They should just add minor talents at like level 20,25,35,40 and so on to make it feel like a mix between the classic trees and the retail talents.
---
Reset and start all over again.
---
I raided as holy/prot and the only time I can remember wearing non plate for PVE was a few times for resist gear. I was very lucky getting my lawbringer and blue dungeon set early
---
There are only Holy Paladins, nothing else.
---
Very possible. Only thing that is certain is herod will still be a shitshow lol
---
Your opinion doesn’t hold more weight just because you manage help desk tickets
---
Easy there Adolf..
---
Shadow priest is cool man.
---
Can someone please post a video or screenshots for those not able to play it? 😁
---
Well it's most definately not night elf as it would take ages to get to the AH.
---
Anything else should be ok.
---
Holy Paladin is by far the least consume heavy spec in the game, at least the later you get into progression. Warlock would be a lot faster to level, so it depends on which one you want first.
---
In your opinion, I personally want to roll a priest and if I decide to go dwarf will I be able to secure a raid-spot so late into the game?
---
You should make that game
---
anything that can heal so the lock can just keep tapping and non stop dps.
---
Honestly I’m excited for the nostalgia and the community aspect, but in terms of class design and balance i think BC servers would be much better to play
---
That’s a very good point.
---
I think mage is among the best because the inherent slows mean you never get hit (thus no pushback to spells) and the mana cost on frostbolt is quite low.  
---
Plus there's evocation, "free" water and portals.
---
Actually currently playing it - getting my lore ready!
---
No, you do not need all expansions, just a basic account and game time.
---
Oh aren't you the wonderful condescending person!  
---
Look to the other response I've gotten: there's a way to talk to people and a way to just be an ass. Maybe look it up on google sometime if you don't understand it.
---
Noooo opposite. People will always be running dungeons and molten core so it’s not like you will have a hard time finding ways to gear up once you hit 60. 
---
There’s so many quest and items that make you go back and do things you have already done.
---
a big advice to all people who will try classic hunters for the first time:
---
Your pet will have happiness that you need to keep. You manage it by feeding the pet. If the happiness level drops too low, your pet escapes and you dont have it any more. BECAUSE of that, leveling cooking is really REALLY great for hunters. why? here it goes:
---
You can feed your pet several diffirent things depending on its diet, most commonly meat. But you cant feed your pet the same level meat all the time; as you level up, your pet wont like low level meats and more so, higher the level of meat, more happiness it gives per meat. And COOKING a meat/fish (you can give many of them also raw) INCREASES the level of the meat.  So while a hunter without cooking will have a lot of trouble keeping the pet happy, or having lots of useless meat after some leveling with the pet, the one with the cooking will have much easier time.
---
Sadly it's actually the opposite. The active, vocal portion of the gaming community are against it sure, but that isn't the majority. Most of the people who play games are going to be people either children or people who are super casual and don't take part in any community.
---
Both of those groups would rather a free game that they can pay small amounts of money for at a time rather than a more consistent, low cost. When I was in secondary school, the same people who would be shocked that I played a game that cost £10 a month also played Candy Crush, Clash of Clans etc and would pay for microtransactions, probably costing them more than my subscription.
---
To the top!

I captured the same name on stalagg days after that I got the second herod opened up, so probs stalagg. Imma stream and make lots of enemies if people even know I exist

Now this I can endorse
---
The only difference within a pet family like cats is the attackspeed, a faster attackspeed doesn't mean more damage, just distributed over more amount of hits. More hits has the advantage of pushback if you fight against casters in pvp and also gives you a higher uptime on the beastmaster talent frenzy.
---
Overall just take a cat you like best the difference is negligible unless you world pvp a lot. But if you want to stick to a pet for leveling don't forget that you still have to tame other beasts for higher ranks of claw/bite/dash.
---
yes and that's immediately followed by "when we turn off layering the problem with queues may become critical" meaning that the medium now = full in Vanilla is due to the layering, not necessarily because Classic servers have a cap of 6000 (or whatever) while Vanilla had 3000 before queues popped up.
---
It's still not clear, and the blue statement doesn't help much.
---

Doubtful, many players did not activate early just to reserve a name so anybody that didn't already create one wouldn't be able to join their guild members / friends. It would be a disaster.
---
*Laughs in goblin sapper charges*
---
feral/boomkin druids and ret pally are I'd say the three most commonly noted meme builds. It's not that they can't do what they want to, it's just their effectiveness per effort/gear invested is so much lower than the alternatives.
---
But every class has at least one viable spec.
---
So does it use your own characters or do you have to start a whole new character for this specific "expac" I haven't played since whatever came after MoP.
---
I wanna be the only worgen in the entire game

That's a great point! You can only be "the chosen one" so many times..there is a difference between **epic adventures** and incoherently swapping between saving the world and collecting poop for some deranged Vulpera every so often.

Magmadar, Chromaggus, Huhuran, Ghaz'Ranka, AQ 40 bug trio, Ouro, Fankriss the Unyeilding, Kurinnaxx, Buru the Gorger, Ayamiss the Hunter, and Maexxna. There's a beast boss in every raid but Only.
---
its ok bois we got 12 servers on NA , were ready

&gt;Plus there's evocation, "free" water and portals.

TEN minute cooldown, still takes 30 seconds to drink and yea portals are fucking amazing

THICC 👁👄👁
---
I like the clone realm idea. Then give til the 1st of september. Any character that hasn't logged in by then gets flagged for a name-change.
---
Just level them with exploration to 5. Takes like an hour maybe a little less if you follow a video perfectly. Gets some flight paths out of the way too.
---
If by speed buffs you mean cat/spirit wolf I would say that it would only give a sleight advantage until 40 when you get your mount (with gathering professions/some farming you should be able to afford it when you ding 40). At 40 with mounts the priest is probably going to run through mobs more quickly/efficiently.
---
Druids aren't the best at anything in endgame except flag running so keep that in mind. They also scale poorly with gear so you will only feel more inferior as time goes on and other classes gear up with major increases in hps/dps.
---
Shamans can run resto/ele specs that are good for pvp and pve so you can heal in pve and chain lightning people in the face in pvp.
---
Well that will certainly be the case for now at least :)
---
Slow is best for both and it's not even close. You'll get damage multipliers on your multi-shot and aimed shot both of which have a fixed casting time. It also makes kiting far easier and more effective when you don't have to keep stopping. No matter what your weapon's rate of fire, you still spend the same amount of time standing still while firing. You can reload while running.
---
As a brand new player, this is the kind of optimization tip I'm looking for. Cheers.
---
Does this include the inevitable zone crashing which will occur too?
---
Nice thighs.

Because they were talking about developers, within a large company, being switched from the game THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED, and placed ONTO ANOTHER GAME. The poster then goes on to explain how well that new game is doing and wonders what might have been had he stayed with the original game.
---
OR did you just want to shit on overwatch?
---
You could also duel in Ironforge if you stood behind one of the pillars at the bank and challenged the other person from behind it. Really hope Blizzard didn't "fix" that
---
tfw you open on an unsuspecting mage without your pvp trinket/skull on
---
Its the 4chan server. Enjoy.
---
Shaman healing is not second rate at max level. I'd rather have a shaman in 5 mans because of ankh and totems over a priest stam buff and no wipe protection.
---
In raids you can bring up to 8 shamans and their buffs would still be useful to someone as they're only party buffs. Realistically I think raids usually go for 1-2 heal druids and then 50/50 priests shamans, more or less.
---
You actually want classic and retail to be the same game?
---
And a bank one
---
Nah,  it's definitely the shorter social span of the average person here.  I say this knowing full well that I too am present here
---
I value trolls over orcs. In theory, the extra pet damage looks amazing, but at classic pets doesnt have aoe damage reduction etc, and healers dont have lots of mana they throw around so they wont heal your pet. Also your pet heal is channeled so you wont to. So in pve environment, you pet will die a lot.
---
Good catch,  didn't see the rules
---
What's the bast class and race to get to level 2. I've spent over 40 hours doing the math to figure this out. If I waste even a millisecond in game, it won't be worth it. Any tips or guides on getting to level 2 would be appreciated.
---
The simplest solution is offer server transfers and let people who don't want to deal with queus transfer off.
---
T2 micro on Amazon. Leggo
---
Some say, when it’s really quiet in Duskfall, you can still hear the cries of a sheep wandering the pumpkin patch.
---
People say they will merge the servers to reduce queue time. But as far as I know all pvp servers are full so that would not make any sense at all?
---
And I also doubt they would do that if they are sending out warnigs as well. Shazzrah on EU are also on 10k+ queue and golemagg and the new one is also full, so by merging queues would not really be reduced?
---
Did you not beat TFT?
---
Idk, you seem to have deleted it,  so
---
I'm not like some people who feel the need to min-max absolutely everything, but I still like to read guides and ratings and BiS lists because I still enjoy the idea of seeing the best items and thinking about what I'm going to try to get first, what I need, etc. It's fun for me because it gives me clear goals to achieve. Reading these things and playing how you want aren't antithetical.
---
While the original screenshots are long gone this shows the ability to max fishing regardless of character level which was possible prior to patch 1.2, Dec 18th 2004.
---
That’s a good start.
---
Yea personally I think it adds a lot more to the game. Played on pve server back in vanilla, and I though wPvP was the best thing there were. Played on pservers as well and think it is an overall blast. 1v1 can turn to skirmishes, or maybe into full blown war. It creates an additional reason to creat strong social connections to come and aid you. New friendships can come out of wPvP.. and it is something different in classic since there are no flying mounts.
---
Making events raiding other factions cities are great, when losing honor is not a thing ^^
---
Many see past the ganking and takes the good with the bad... you get ganked but you also gank yourself. It’s part of the war, and it’s not that bad what people who dislike pvp servers make it out to be. You will have plenty of time to do whatever you want and enjoy pvp in the world... one of the things I really enjoy about vanilla is that there are danger around every corner and you have to be prepared before heading out.
---
And something I think is really satisfying as well is finding that individual from the other faction who actually comes and save you from certain death and you help each other and make each other save versus potential player threat. 
---
I think there are a lot to love from pvp servers.
---
So names that hadn't been used since vanilla got cleared in WoD? That is a very long time.
---
Thinking about the same thing differently, you would be doing dungeons with the people **from your server** that you met who were good players! The only reason why this is even a thing is because you meet a thousand different people a day in current completely interconnected WoW.
---
But it is true that it does have its upsides, since you are basically playing with 100.000 people at a time instead of your run of the mill 5000 or so.
---
You can always use a fps limiter and classic presets if you're really into potato performance...
---
PallyPower.   Going to need a good Paladin buff addon.
---
Weird. The current expac has more subs than vanilla ever did. So had every other single expac after vanilla. It’s almost like you don’t have a fucking clue what your talking about.
---
As long as you get in with a good group of people; let them know your intentions and can be reliable you should be able to. Reliability and competence go a long way. Most good guilds have an A team and a B team for raids anyway at different times so I wouldn’t see why not !
---
By the time he's 60 ZA might be already out or close to being out, which is a huge catch up mechanic, actually.
---
Im gonna go the other way and say NO, very bad idea, unless you plan to play on a PvE server.
---
Phase 2 should be kicking in right around the 6 month mark, and if youre not 60 by then, youre gonna have a bad time.
---
Phase 2 introduces the honor system and rewards, but battlegrounds wont be in until Phase 3. So Phase 2 is going to be the golden age of world pvp, which is great, but its not good for leveling. Every flight path is going to be camped, every questing hub is going to be a battleground. And once you are worth honor to a level 60... you are going to have a bad time.
---
So, not saying you shouldnt play in 6 months, but if you do i highly recommend rolling PvE.
---
if you like pvp, hunters are ALWAYS great fun. So you dont "need" another class to play at later phases. Also remember at classic leveling is really hard, so "I will just make an alt" thing dont really work that easy.
---
Thanks I'll do that
---

---
&gt;  won't be as laggy as back in the day. 
---
No, its still a lagfest. Asmongold did some big raids in beta and they were a mess.
---
Even BFA has lagfests sometimes(8.2 launch had some areas going crazy with Warmode on).
---
This was my nightmare scenario when I changed my characters to correctly make the right class and look for my name at 2am the other day.
---
Can I get you to explain what you mean by the least consume heavy please? I appreciate the response!
---
Great. Can you give me any insight on the other servers or know of any place I can find info?
---
Yeah, nowadays you know Method and the top world people and that's basically it. There are no "brackets" of competition unless you specifically make them for yourself as Taliesin goes about on his videos about competing with the "Vox Immortalis" named guilds lol :)
---
Asmongold did some raids on Classic Beta. They still caused a lot of lag.
---
4Chan guild is actually on grobbulus but ok
---
Only Blizz has that data and they think it will happen.
---
I'm inclined to agree because unlike a brand new MMO lots of people who play BFA will be trying this out because it costs them absolutely nothing.  They don't pay for a box, they don't have to pay any extra monthly fee, they don't even need to create a new free account. 
---
I've never seen a barrier to entry so low.  This means people will try it out on a whim, with little to no intention to stick around.
---
The odds of a retail playing staying on classic is very low.  They're looking to grab people who currently don't play retail, older players who have unsubbed recently or years ago.  Those players are likely to stay around (though there will be a dropoff there too, and blizz has data based on every expansion launch to look at that) but they have to account for everyone else who in their words will be a "tourist".  just there to check the game out for a day or a week or so and then go back to their main.
---
They could have left a vanilla version. Your argument is stupid, they didn’t roll the site back to vanilla now did they? They just made a vanilla version which they should have added/kept years ago.
---
this is bs.  Counter-Strike is/was a skill based game.  Your aim told everything about you.
---
Yea, I'm sure 4channers will definitely no doubt make up a significant portion of the 2nd highest pop server.
---
Can't really think of any better that aren't in use already, but you go ahead.
---
L O L
---
This sounds about right.  I'm probably more closly leaning to a druid or shaman.  
---
The question becomes - is the money making potential of travel form + herbalism  worth the handicap (I can always create a priest / shaman later too). XD
---
I mean, he was not in classic WoW. That’s my point
---
&gt; Since your pet can already eat the raw food that find, there is really no use for cooking it first. 
---
this is extremely wrong, sorry m8. When you cook the meat, you increase the level of the meat. So it gives more happiness, and you can cook low level meats that your pet wont eat. So in reality, it is super useful.
---
Why waste your scatter shot just to FD trap?
---
This is true in very specific cases, provided you don't get a drop of some sort.  I think there are 2 axes Joana recommends for warriors in Durotar, however I personally always have trouble bringing myself to shell out the 22s at that point.  The moment I buy that axe, I'll get a drop that's the same thing, and then I won't be able to sell it back for what I bought it for.
---
Happy hunting!
---
They had 4 capped guilds worth of people like a week ago, its only gotten bigger since. That's 500 people per guild btw.
---
Not everyone who enjoys pvping at low levels is definitely going to twink. I plan on doing a little bit of pvp as I level up because I enjoy it, but I still want to make it to 60.
---
Gotcha! I plan to be a mage on whitemane with a bunch of friends. Is mage going to be highly contested do you think? I'm mainly picking them because they level well and making portals seems super useful.
---
you are right, that's the way I read it too. If the cap is several times larger now meaning they can literally have 8000 or 12000 concurrent players online before queues appear, THEN THERE WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM WHEN LAYERING IS TURNED OFF. Instead they specifically state that queues will become a huge issue the moment layering is turned off... meaning that the current "several times larger" cap is due to layering.
---
There are also numerous non-technical problems with the modern cap being several times larger permanently... even if the servers can handle it fine, 10000 online is very very different than 3500. questing, resource gathering, the sheer amount of people packed into single zones... No one's seen that in WoW yet except on Nost, and believe me it's a different experience there in every way than anything that happened in vanilla.
---
They will never the same game..but WoW as an ever-evolving game could have a defining line of **gameplay principles** that would be closer to what vanilla does in the respects where it engaged people more than current WoW.
---
you can always use superscaling to tax your gpu.
---
super useful. When you cook the meat, you increase the level of the meat. So it gives more happiness, and you can cook low level meats that your pet wont eat, and make them edible. So in reality, it is super useful.
---
It wasn't a couple of months ago tho, good things it's cheap again.
---
i like your attitude
---
Cause this is his Ironforge set looking dapper as flux, once inside MC he puts on his dress again.
---
I can post it more places :) Any recommendations?
---
I may or may not have had a bad habit of getting people to run instances and then passing out at my computer during them... Nothing like convincing 4 other people to run Mara and then coming to hours later staring at the login screen.
---
Making up hate for upvotes
---
I think OP is just trying to get people worked up.
---
And healers make up 1/4 or less of the playerbase , you'll be fine
---
You will lose time. Sure it's not as hardcore as losing items etc. but still a thing and can be annoying.
---
But the venom sac quest opens up Crown of the Earth chain, which is like 5,000xp and super easy.
---
High elf, highborne, what's the difference, right? Heck, Thalyssra calls it the night elf empire during Suramar's intro cutscene which is just every flavour of wrong.
---
But then they dont get those sweet preorders.
---
Vanilla wasn't a thing officially until Classic was announced. Wowhead follows the official game, you can't expect them to support every expansion ever.
---
Sure, and I'm not saying that anyone should forgive or forget the bad release, just that saying that it's currently garbage based on that is kind of stupid. CSGO was pretty flawed at release but they put in a lot of work to make it into the good game it is today, it would be wrong to say the game is garbage now based on what it was like at release. Same thing.
---
I can't wait for all the forum posts begging for transfers from Herod players sitting in queue while the rest of us play.
---
Hmm were they not? If so than my mistake.
---
I played four lvl 60's in retail vanilla and can confirm this experience. No one invited a sub 60 character after launch to those dungeons unless they really needed a priest.
---
Ah right, that would probably be why then. I'm used to the fire one from MC and BWL, but sadly didn't do AQ40 back then. Well, good info. :)
---
Uhm no. We've been chanting for #nochanges for years at this point. 3k caps just like vanilla. If you want changes you can go back to your shitty private servers.
---
in my humble opinion, every prof other than blacksmithing and tailoring works great at hunter. They all have ups and downs. the common logic is, Engineering is the best for pvp, if you can use it well. But also for example alchemy is also really great. At classic you die SO FAST and pots heal a lot compared to your health. At early 60 you will have 3k health and your pots can crit 2.2k. Or as you have deadzone at classic (you cant ranged attack below 8 yards, and melee more than 5 yards), being able to use free action potion is amazing. As gold is also low at classic, being able to craft them yourself is generally great.
---
All other profs are good for self crafts and gold making. There is really no "bad choise" for hunters, other than BS and Tailor.
---
I've actually had better experiences with people in hardcore guilds than the casual guilds. The casual guilds are so bad and because the players don't focus as much, often cause more drama.
---
I don’t think you understand how 4chan works
---
Where are you getting your information from?
---
I level as a MM/Surv hybrid for pvp. BM is the fastest leveling spec but I want reps on the PVP tools I will use at 60.
---
While true, the premise of my point lies in the percentage comparison. The pie graph is used specifically for that purpose.
---
By that logic the whole game is a kiddie game.
---
Well I know you aren't playing on Grobb because Ion doesnt believe in RpPvp servers
---
I originally started playing OG WoW during what is considered phase 4. You will be fine
---
&gt; Layering takes a full world and splits it into a bunch of different dead ones.

Yeah, I discovered, but leveled fine without it :)

From my experience you just need mana potions. No downranking necessary.

Not to mention you’re an absolute unit in world PvP and bgs. You’ll always be invited to come world PvP cause your utility, lockdown potential, and mobility, mixed with decent heals and damage is considerably needed in world PvP groups. You can do everything. And you’re so hard to kill. You’ll escape any 1v1 fight you don’t want to participate in. Not to mention stealth, with 4s stuns. No class has the upper hand on you. Except maybe hunters. You just have to shift properly against them.

Goddamn. Rares, repair vendors. Annoying underwater items. Doesn't work that well for caves, I guess you'd need the "inside" map and I dunno how you'd display it. Also the show quests doesn't seem to be working for me. Anyway, this is fucking great to go on a second monitor. Excellent, thank you very much. Someone should have done this years ago.
---
If you aren't going to *ever* actively seek out / engage in World PvP, either whilst leveling or at 60 for things like town raids / defence, etc then i wouldn't bother rolling PvP. 
---
It's not necessary and if you aren't going to engage in the benefits of a PvP server then really you're just playing on a server that allows other people to fuck with you for no reason.
---
Most people will say you're missing out on a lot i'd imagine, but i had mates reroll even @ 60 off our high pop PvP realm in vanilla because if you aren't there to engage in PvP it's just something that prevents you from having fun at times.
---
I feel very much the same as you do regarding pvp. 
---
When I started playing in 2006 I joined a pvp realm because friends played there. I didn't know any better and got frustrated a few times. Once your knowledge base grows alongside your character's level - yes there is something to be said for the immersion, sense of danger, nowhere is truly safe etc. Which is great for those who want that in Classic too (and I legit wish them the best in their authentic experience). I've played on pve realms since midway through Wrath and personally never regretted it. My playtime (especially in evenings when I can actually sit down and get some stuff done) is too valuable to me these days to have it be dictated by others with different priorities. I don't want to be spawn camped for hours at Blackrock Mountain. I don't want to have random 60s ganking me because I didn't level as fast as they did. I agree that pvp servers fit the whole idea and immersion of a faction war beautifully, but I'm personally not interested in paying that price. 
---
You could always decide to make an alt on a pvp server and roll your main on pve. I might actually go that way myself. That way you have the option of sampling both worlds. 
---
Cheers and have a great time in Classic!

Is it available through the Twitch app? Like I mentioned I ultimately could look for addons elsewhere but I really would want them in curseforge to syn/backup without having to manually keep my add-on files and the WTF folder for the settings
---
I would say spirit is almost the best stat for hunter leveling.
---
Hunter is the only class that does not need to cast anything to deal damage, while having mana. If you can stack some spirit items (which are the easiest to find at classic greens), you have have a LOT of regen while grinding. Your killing speed will go down only like %10-20 due to low agility, but your regen will go double.
---
this is not theory level, it tried it and it was really amazing. Send pet and auto attack, and you regen %30 mana back at 1 mob.
---

"Projection is a form of defense in which unwanted feelings are displaced onto another person, where they then appear as a threat from the external world. A common form of projection occurs when an individual, threatened by his own angry feelings, accuses another of harbouring hostile thoughts."
---
Ignore the you won’t be immersed bs. Its something people who have never experienced actual dangerous PvP that has consequences. It’s just carebear PvP. Play on what you want and don’t let the fake PvPers tell you otherwise.

Four private server I can think of in the last four years have had over 13k peaks especially on launch.
---
I like 3/3 shield block for ocd reasons.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0xzZVZxizheMzio is probably my final build
---
Is that island to the south of tanaris there?
---
Nope
---
Holy priest with an affliction/demo lock is pretty decent if you are quest grinding
---
really wonder why, I mean they for sure could leave at least a month between the "releases" oh well... time to nolife level my rogue and then do diablo's conquest challenges lul ... at least friends who wont be playing classic can boost me xD
---
Spirit is the priority for me in how I like to play. Hunter is the only class that has mana but doenst need to cast staff to kill. This means, when you are low on mana and have high spirit, you can just send your pet and auto attack, and fill up your mana almost like drinking water.
---
MMOs need a lot of regular maintenance, all freemium mmos just end up sucking hard.
---
Yes you can. I used to tank instances as BM for some friends at the time. It's totally doable. The only thing is you need other members with CC as you can only really tank one mob at a time. Obviously you want a tanking pet for this.
---
Applying the majority of your effort for content for the lowest common denominator is how you get retail wow.
---
Some elitism is good, it provides motivation to git gud.
---
I hear warlocks level affliction, so SM/DS. SL is good, but you won't see the benefits from it while leveling. It's benefit is survivability in PVP. However, if you're on a PVP server I think respeccing to SL at 40ish from affliction is awesome.
---
&gt; And healers make up 1/4 or less of the playerbase , you'll be fine
---
What do good raid setups look like? 8/40 Healers? Or more?
---
Kevin Jordan, the ex-wow dev turned streamer brought up a good point during the beta over the summer about how he thought each item and spell in the game should have it's own specific icon, he thought it was lazy that they reused so many especially because of how good the icons were. He said the artist for them was his favorite but didn't stay around long, or something. Don't remember the specifics of what he said about the artist for the original icons other than that they were his favorite and blizzard should've had more made (unique one for each thing)
---
I have to agree, like you pointed out the GNPP and flask to increase Mana by 2000 share an icon and how bad would that suck to waste a flask that's worth a minimum of 100g thinking it's a 3g GNPP .. 
---
It hasn't happened to me with flask of supreme power but I always make sure to put it in a weird spot in my bags, by itself
---
The did update their u.i. to something similar, so if you cant get aux , auctioneer should work.
---
NP :) Happy to help
---
The 20% damage increase is offset if your pet has 20% more uptime. I'd wager that a boar is capable of getting to it's next target more than 20% faster as Charge will likely be off CD on most pulls.  It has a 25 yard range and gets the boar on it's target in probably about .25 seconds. Pets normally run at about 7 yards per second so your boar will get to attack that mob for about 3 full seconds longer AND it's first attack will generate a ton of threat allowing you to open up harder with bow. Boars can also learn Bite for a focus dump, although they can't learn Claw.
---
Sounds cool, although personally I'd prefer a "last to 60" race
---
Cool, that'll do. A little manually intensive (as you said, there's probably a more elegant formula), but these equations are only going to be run against a couple of scenarios, so it'll work.
---
First off you easily max loyalty so this wouldn't matter anyway. Second off he is just wrong. The only thing that affects food's "quality" for your pet is its level requirement. Don't feed Tough Jerky to a level 57 pet.
---
Good one!
---
XFiles
---
This is wrong man. Imagine if our what 10 NA realms had a cap of 3-4k? There's going to be a que on every server because there's no way that little amount of people will be playing. The realm size will be increased after layering.
---
Affliction with some points in demonology and you use imp till 60 apply all curses and then wand the mobs to death
---
Battlestar Galactica.
---
I think this is an old meme template, but yeah it's like 5 minutes in Photoshop
---
You just eat a ton the week before that way your body can just consume itself as you play for 200 straight hours
---
My region only has 2, lmao.
---
Didn't realise 1.12 had ah in every city not just if. Sorry
---
Is he albino? He looks like he never see sunlight. And with all the millions he makes, why does his teeth look so awful. He should be visiting a dentist.
---
Ruining Classic counts as fun for you? Kk
---
We shall see
---
Someone must be playing a paladin
---
If you have low enough ping, your opponent can't react to your FD to dodge. At high ping, I see this being viable.
---
So, 1-32, 32-44, 44-53, and 53-60 all are about 1/4 of the total leveling time.
---
Ohhh nooooo
---
3-5 k is the perfect server size.
---
who's cutting onions in my apartment right now?
---
It’s not that every nation won’t be represented on each server, ofc it will. However there are just huge hubs of guilds from each nationalities gathered around the different servers. What he is reporting is the same thing I’ve heard from people who arrange this. The Nordic collusion had more than 70 guilds with more than 5000 players wanted to center around one server. Those leaders were in meetings on where to go, and they have connections to the other collusion’s as well, so everyone knows where each hub are going.
---
It’s not like every Brit is on Shazz, and every Swedes are on Gehannas that’s ridiculous to assume. But the major hubs from each country and the majorities are focused on those servers that he reports.
---
He is just missing a few actually. Poland also announced over 2k Poles are gonna join Shazz as well.
---
Sitting in 6 hour queues is fun?
---
Chromie is our real homie. Chromie &gt; Chris Metzen
---
Zataran’s in a box. Put in pressure cooker with some water, sausage and some diced tomatoes then wait 25 minutes.
---
having a addon that count like that for you is great idea but i personally think you have far to much dead space down there, a third of the screen is your overlay.
---
There’s going to be issues for sure. I’m confident that the game will run smoothly after 2-3 weeks though
---
Well I know about it now, \_Brian\_!  Thanks a lot, jerk!  I thought we were friends.
---
That would make no sense. They're trying to gauge where people are going to play. If people keep their names on Herod but get names on other servers they have no idea what you're most likely going to commit to
---
There will be tens of thousands of people on your server and you base your ideas about class distribution on a Discord with dozens of people?
---
Africa is an Ocean you pineapple turd.
---
I bought 100g back in the day, had it all spent in an hour at vendors in Stormwind on absolutely nothing remotely useful whatsoever.
---
In classic I just fed my pet whatever I killed it was no biggy. But the second he and I dinged 60 he refused everything. I either had to cook him something or buy food from a vendor.
---
Remember pet food recipes in BC?
---
I give it a day at most.
---
No need to get out of shape man, just sayin’ human starter zones have awful quest rewards (ye hogger is an exception haha), there are almost no greens on these lvls compared to dwarves and night elves...
---
“I’m not playing a hunter because they don’t scale at all with gear”  -the 8th fury warrior rocking dal rend a month into BWL
---
I cannot imagine having the determination and focus to level up in classic wow while high. 
---
I'm pretty sure I'd just go fish for like 3 hours.
---
That girl has made a couple cool video so far at least they're putting some awesome effort into Old School recruiting ads
---
Ffxiv is a weeb game
---
Yeah, haha, Blizzard selling level boosts would NEVER happen.

Can we all just agree that Horde racials are OP when it comes to PVP? 
---
My guess was they were trying to draw more people to the Horde side since they knew alliance would be full of xLegolasx.
---
And a trip hohome thaaaaanks to chrooooooooooooooooooo.................. Mieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
---
Only reason I started playing wow in the first place was because I played the WC rts
---
It was a dark, dark time but it's behind us now.
---
Do you want to a top tier raider? If so then youll need time. Otherwise just play at your pace. This isn’t a race for everyone.
---
But everyone knew Herod was gonna be a clusterfuck. They chose 10 hour queues over Streamers and Hispanic people "ruining their experience"
---
&gt; on a second screen
---
This explains so many of the dungeon groups I've had...
---
See the part I find so fascinating is I think hes both wrong and right. Vanilla, that is one thing... but his overall point? I wonder how much people would change their tune if there is a real TBC dungeon balance again. I know it burned me the fuck out as a warrior and I played until Panda.
---
I never played on a tBC private server, was it just my OG server that seemed to have no tanks but warriors and maybe 1 druid, but druid and pally could actually tank the dungeons?
---
I was a DPS warrior my entire career but GL being DPS in those dungeons.
---
Server merging completely messes with server economies/names/guildnames/not knowing who people are etc. that's the main issue with that. Having fewer servers with healthy populations is the ideal scenario.
---
Just theory crafting here so I may sound crazy but it would probably look more like battle shout replaces sunder armor and if the threat generation becomes high enough wouldn't one of the DPS warriors take other spamming sunder armor instead of hamstring?
---
Cooldown dependent in PvP. Not quite as gear dependent or bad leveling as Warriors, but close. LW I'd only recommend if you really want to make items yourself, it's a whole lot of time &amp; money for items you'll replace pretty fast (or could buy from someone else). Skinning, Mining, Herbalism, Alchemy, and Engineering are much more useful imo.
---
I would say rogue so you can stealth to the chest and get out of dodge before anyone notices.
---
They're not merging anything lol
---
I hope you are right
---
Do you have tabs for this? That was great
---
Got space for 1 more down there?
---
Alright I'm suuuper late, but can you actually play a death knight in classic? I thought they came with like wotlk?
---
Weird. You dont know the number of subs they have now. Its almost like you dont have a fucking clue what your talking about.
---
“We all have jobs”  and those of us who are down to wait don’t? Lmao
---
that's what she said
---
Many thanks, that will help a lot!
---
So I'll level to 32 with [traditional combat spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZG0Ez0mz) (Imp. SS, Imp. Gouge, Riposte, Imp. Chance to Hit) but at 32, you'll have enough talent points to spec as [follows](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fZZxzeochoo).
---
This gives you increased stealth and speed while stealthed, Imp. Sap, Hemo, and Prep.  Tons of extra utility and while it *will* slow you down in terms of killing mobs since you don't have BF to kill multiple mobs and won't do as much damage as Combat spec, in the war zone that will be world PvP early on, the extra stealth will be huge, not only against other players, but to quest safely by skipping tons of mobs that are accessible to the other players.  And with most players having crappy gear early on, Hemo will actually be pretty good at killing other players.
---
You are literally the only person in this post saying its a 4chan server lmao. Get the fuck out of here
---
It was also a way different time. Looking at raw subscriptions numbers really doesn’t tell the whole story.  
---
1) a good computer
---
2) stable internet connection
---
3) monthly subscription fee (back then this was relatively unheard of, especially at $15/month)
---
These were huge barriers to entry so to speak that likely had a significant impact on subscription numbers.  When wow had first released I wanted to play but didn’t have these things, later I ended up getting a job to make this happen (was in HS).  
---
Vanilla also may have had relatively less numbers as far as active subscriptions but the growth was unheard of.  Blizzard was constantly behind on servers and hardware.  
---
When was the last time you hit a login queue on retail?? 
---
This was huge issue at launch, but it also wasn’t a non issue throughout the rest of vanilla.  
---
You’re looking at retail in a perfect, already set up and maintained context and saying look at the numbers it’s better.
---
But the servers out now are enough. The only problem in the US is Herod.
---
i see, i planned to roll full beastmaster. how are they in raids?
---
True, but part of the appeal of this for me would be collecting the sets slowly over time!
---
Depends on your skill level with the Class.
---
I'm not a warrior main and I'm too lazy to look into your numbers but you gotta be missing something, there's no way the ultra sweaties on pservers would have overlooked something like that.
---
Yeah, I should have been more specific. You’re not the only one who thought that I’m sure
---
You can actually get stuff done in the world.
---
As somebody who likes (and is good at) PvP I got tired of wastimg my time when farming, x-fered to a PvE realm and x-fered back when I had copius amounts of mats.
---
If you change your mind. X-fer.
---
Take the economy with you.
---
"Ridd it dit dit do!"
---
According to this my vanilla experience was a 1 in 100....
---
Point 1 has never been my experience. Point 2 is vaguely true except doesn't matter if the hunter has low ping.
---
"They know this bcs they are smarter than you".
---
This is a meme already xD
---
Ok ok, I don't know this even saying it, but for sure Activision Blizzard wouldn't do anything bad for the game.
---
Never.
---
😂
---
I'm just surprised at how attached people are to names, especially since the vast majority of people playing are older.                                                               I can see RP servers caring about names but I can careless what my name is in the end.  I understand people have their reasons so i'm not here to say its stupid or anything, I just cant relate.
---
Same here, 100%. But you can't deny that there is a big disparity in game play difference between an MMORPG and an RTS. Sure, they two fanbases can switch back and forth between the two, but MMORPG players and RTS players are generally very dedicated to those genres.
---
Forget Orbus, NMS is the true first VR mmo.
---
I thought we just had a thread on the front page that had beta-accurate projections for 700+ Ret dps in phase 1?
---
You’re welcome, just know we only eat hot pockets down here.
---
I think actual bloodelf models in the game would have been sick. Those guards DWM are horrifying
---
$2 an hour? You will get super bored doing this and when you only make $2 an hour You will stop
---
Understandable. If not one of those classes mentioned you'll probably get it pretty quickly, if the items manage to drop ofc.
---
It won't proc on a full block or parry
---
Yep
---
Yeah, that's what I thought. You're just some pretender.
---
[I'm not though](https://imgur.com/qjSNQSA). And that was *before* Zwetan started profit sharing with us devs.
---
Well, if we get that into account, it could be yeah haha.
---
I think I should take a few days off as well. But not on release, maybe a few days later to ensure that servers are already stable.
---
You weren't labeled as a "chosen one", but you're still the "sole adventurer" that's solving everyone's problems. That demon that's been terrorizing us for days/months/years? You're the only one who has been able to kill him off.
---
From a narrative perspective it makes sense that you're a "hero" now vs 60 levels ago. You're not quelling a boar problem, a small murloc uprising, or a simple necromancer raising some dead from the grave. Your character has gone into the emerald nightmare, killed a titan, and a few old gods.
---
So?
---
Like, I would switch in a heartbeat if there was a second German PvP server ¬. ¬
---
I would also play on a medium English server - but from experience there are just too many people that don't speak English what makes grouping with randoms just annoying.
---
Thank you for the suggestion. Its implemented now and I styled the result table a bit so its easier to see now.
---
I think so.
---
Its not crazy high think about time played to 60 and hourly pay
---
Everyone knows female orcs dominate

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/crqamd/well_wellwell/). 
---
Sounds about right.
---
Well, the thing he did wrong wasn't suggesting that retail is better.  If that's his opinion, that's fine.   What he did wrong was tell the person asking about vanilla servers (and everyone else in general) what they thought.
---
His exact words were "and you don't want it either, you think you do, but you don't."
---
And that's what he corrected when he admitted that "for some people, vanilla is their favorite."
---
Classic Version Addons DO NOT show up on the Twitch / Curseforge App. You have to manually download the folder from the link you've posted and move it into the Addons folder.
---
AFTER THAT you'll see the addon actually show up on the "my addons" tab on the app allowing you to actually update it when newer versions are getting released.
---
Yes and yes.
---
won't be making much 'gold' until inflation starts to ramp up. however long that'll be.
---
They said it for Herod and Shazzrah.  Not all.  But yes unless more realms are added this week launch will be backlogged on all servers
---
Leveling is the chore I have to slog through to play the game at 60.
---
I've played both extensively. During vanilla on PvE, more recently on pservers on PvP realms.
---
If you don't actively seek out or engage in PvP, then definitely roll on a PvE realm. 
---
The "immersion, sense of danger" aspect is grossly oversold, and getting griefed/camped is a real pain and can ruin a session if you are forced to log off or play an Alt. 
---
There are tons of people who's sense of enjoyment in the game comes from ruining yours, and gleefully seek out the chance to do so. If this is likely to frustrate you, stay away from the "true experience".
---
Besides, the "true experience" is also be leveling, questing, making friends, running instances, playing the auction house, fishing, take screenshots of cool sunsets, raiding, running BG's, etc etc etc. PvP is not the only or even primary "true experience".
---

That's what I did back in 2005! I was waiting to get my first debit card so I could finally play World of Warcraft, but in the meantime I wanted to know more about the universe.
---
I wasn't into RTS games (I like the building aspect but not the fighting &amp; resource race stuff) and only cared for the story. I DID end up cheating through half of the Frozen Throne just to end it quickly (didn't care, just wanted story).
---
Unfortunately, I REALLY caught the Warcraft bug. Not only did I get addicted to WoW, but I ended up reading 12 Warcraft books over the course of two years. I haven't read that much since the Harry Potter days. Loved it and I can't wait to play the Reforged Warcraft 3 (no cheating this time).
---
It's a question lol
---
Yeah, there are guilds trying for a week 1 kill. Between leveling &amp; the rep needed, I'd be impressed if they manage it.
---
There is services that are legit
---
Fears DR but the sustain and damage / healing output should do really well. 
---
If you run into another duo it's probably going to come down more to skill than whether or not u had a mage vs lock, but I will say that a good mage's ability to control group world PvP is unprecedented.

4chan is scum. We already chased "Clover Club" off of Grobbulus. They're sneaky.
---
There will always be some that quit, but my view is that a large number of those who are 'just going to test it then continue with retail' will get sucked in and remain.
---
Time will tell!
---
Paladin main here, I've been doing a ton of research on ret and specs in general. Here's a short answer:
---
In raids, yes they are a meme spec. The utility they bring is for the most part already brought by the holy paladins. However, people are looking into seal swapping techniques that might make them the best at applying the Nightfall debuff. So if they are in a more hardcore raid that will be their purpose. 
---
With decent gear, ret paladins are decent if not above average in every other aspect of the game. Which is why it's frustrating they constantly get shit on.
---
If there is not another paladin in the group, they are great in dungeons for their buffing and utility, as well as spells like exorcism for undead dungeons. 
---
In PvP they can get kited, but that's pretty much it. And this can be minimized by picking up engineering. Bubbles, buffs, hard hitting, healing. Reckoning in world pvp is a ton of fun. 
---
TL;DR I think it's safe to say that ret is a meme spec in raids, but it's hard to call them a meme spec in any other aspect of the game.
---
It’s good but shorter, they never finished it
---
Boomkin!
---
It's WAY too different. The only thing you may get from playing the retail version of the game would be some type of class fantasy? But even that is just about dead now. To waste time over the next 10 days. Do what I'm doing. Planning what I'm going to be doing. Class, Race, Professions. That way you have a head start come launch day on what you want to accomplish.
---
Ohh shit it's that why? I've always wanted to them to come with more of them up. They're my favorite flash games by far!
---
I actually really liked an orc rogue I had for awhile.  
---
I did the same for undead, but me not that kind of orc.
---
Moorheim, Brevik, The Schaeffer Brothers...none of the people who made Blizzard a great company work there any more. Blizzard is a brand, and now that it’s publicly traded, it’s a revolving door of people, ideas and talent. The creativity and talent that brought you WC3, D1, D2, WoW and SC1 are all gone. Whether its Activision, EA, or Epic Games devs that are working for any of these big public giants, they trade talent often and hire out people with varying levels of success for high-level decision-making. To get upset with blizzard about something like a marketing choice is to get upset with bureaucracy in general.
---
Just go pvp spec and do shitty dps in dungeons it's fine.
---
60 in wow or 100 in POE
---
You and me both, bro
---
Wat?
---
So wait, are they estimating the player count based on 1 character name = 1 person on that server cause if they are then getting 3 names on 1 server would make it look over populated.
---
Believe there is 1 blood elf in Rachet in classic
---
That bridge leads to some of the best battles but the objective after it can be rough if ally is co ordinated
---
I believe they did in Vanilla. I'm not sure about the headless horsemen. But there were some events for some holidays.
---
Of course. I was just trying to explain the point of the meme to this guy
---
it's interesting that we could probably make a high resolution version of his old videos. somone get on that
---
I dunno, I have a similar setup. I have dual monitors on the desk and then my 55 inch TV directly above them. I like to put the news or whatever show I'm watching on the TV above and then I have a game and internet open on the bottom 2 monitors for example.
---
It's nice to be able to just lean back slightly and have the TV there. You definitely can't sit with your face smashed into the monitors and see the whole TV above but you shouldn't be sitting that close to the monitors anyways.
---
Imp all the way... Check staysafe TV YouTuber
---
/camp
---
True but there's a lot of problems with this expansion. If you compared legion to classic it might have been different.
---
I actually like the new talent trees but it feels less like talents and more like you're choosing skills/spells and a rotation rather than deeply investing in a build you want.
---
It also killed hybrid builds which honestly were pretty fun sometimes even if they weren't even close to optimal in group stuff
---
Did anyone find an ingame addon guide for leveling ?
---
For Alliance there's AllyRoute, but I couldn't find anything for horde.
---
doomshot &gt; engineering shells/arrows &gt; ice threaded arrow

They have already raised the caps from vanilla, it's pretty explicit.  I am not sure what's so confusing about that.  You even quote it: their measurements are based on increased capacity.  All I originally said was the caps are increased relative to vanilla, and despite your rambling you seem to agree with that perspective so I don't know what your issue with what I said is?
---
Are the hunter pets in classic stronger than the pets available to warlocks (pre-felguard)?
---
Still, we will get a new record for first to 60 and fastest time to 60. Probably won’t be anyone well known. We have to wait for the release.
---
So what's up with those skills?
---
Just avoid Goldshire.
---
It was BiS until Mara came out (which was rather soon after launch anyways), but Mara will also be in phase 1.
---
Pronounced "haj sif hoo ear" and "Dave", respectively.

Not nearly enough people saw this!

thanks for this.

My vanilla email address is xXxmajinvegeta1337xXx@yahoo.com please send there for my authentic vanilla experience
---
See it like this. Every piece has a 1/4 of dropping each week. That means on average it takes a month for each class to get a full set. Spread that out with 5-6 players of each class and it will take you probably 3-4 months to get the set at an average rate unless if you are getting priorities.
---
Idk it makes it way easier to do repetitive shit for me
---
I hope you're from NA, otherwise people will call you "Jypiter" since that's how its pronounced
---
Just over the horizon, I see rice hats and the chiming of gongs rattle the earth.
---
I might take the easy route out and just end up playing rogue which is similar in many ways but scales much better. I like the concept of druid but I don't want to end up putting in a lot of effort just to deal "okay" damage. Still can't decide between like 4 classes, but there's still more than a week to think. :)

flask in classic lul
---
Take a break from WoW.
---
Dungeons no, raids maybe.
---
From my experience on pvp servers, individual/small pvp is usually either 2v1 fest or people wait for you to pull a mob and get to half health to jump you. Rarely will a individual wpvp jump into a fight they don’t already think they can win. The fun part comes when you are good enough to outplay the fight and laugh at them afterwards.
---
Grp/raid wpvp is totally different and tons of fun when contested well on both sides.
---
Same thing happened to BioWare with EA. The owners sold off their portions of the company and now they chill on yachts. Blizzard is just a brand, and brands don’t make video games, talented, creative developers do.
---
I am right there with you. When I started playing wow it was just me. I went alliance and I have been there ever since. Started as a mage, then paladin, and finally, Druid. This time around I have friends I am starting with. They all want to be horde. This will be a first, and I’ll be going priest! Can’t wait.
---
Can confirm.
---
I mean we still tried to do the questlines as efficiently as possible.
---
I can't speak for current live wow, but I quit when it was going this direction of linear prog. Been doing EQ prog for years but thinkin' i should jump in here. Just fucking hate queuing for something I pay for.
---
Once you are close to done with prebis.

---
# [H][Atiesh]&lt;Colonial Space Marines&gt;
---
## Our History
---
Colonial Space Marines is a North American World of Warcraft Classic raiding guild. We're currently planning to play Horde on the Atiesh server. Throughout Vanilla we obtained the majority of server first kills while clearing all content on Destromath-US. After Vanilla we had many server first kills before going more casual as the game evolved post-Wrath. During Legion we rekindled our motivation for top tier raiding, and are once again heavily active in retail. We are looking to expand our community with new members interested in joining us to relive classic!
---
## Our Ideals

To core members of CSM, WoW has long been a game best shared with others. WoW Classic brings back the 40 player raiding format, and we need good gamers and people to make that happen! So join us for many weeks of gaming, good company, and the fattest of loots. We are happy to help anyone motivated to learn, gear, and improve their play. So if you’re looking for a decent group of people to spend your WoW Classic experience with feel free to apply!
---
## Our Expectations
---
We intend to enjoy the leveling experience, but will swiftly begin pre-raid gearing a couple weeks after launch. We will recruit both social members and raider applicants to build a strong community with. Once ready for raiding we will begin clearing MC and Onyxia weekly. Players with a good attitude who are helpful and perform well will always take priority. Consistent raid attendance is also required to maintain Core Raider status within the guild.
---
## Our Schedule
---
We will set our raiding schedule once pre-raid gearing is underway so we can pick an optimal schedule for our core raiders. Currently the only times not being considered are Tuesdays/Thursdays due to our mythic retail schedule. During early Phases most content will be cleared in a single raid, with a secondary day to fall back on when needed. We will re-visit this schedule as more raiding content comes out to best suit the needs of our guild.

Biggest fear right now. But if it happens Im gonna be enjoying all the frustrated memes and posts
---
I just think Mirage Raceway is such a cool server name! :D
---
Personally, I did the valley of trials then stopped playing, as much as I love classic, I don't want to put more than a few hours into a character that I lose after two days
---
I've always played on PvE realms and really appreciate the fact that I can PvP when I choose to. My time, especially now that I'm a father, is very limited. I don't want to spend it being camped or frustrated with a game I love.
---
You won't regret rolling PvE, especially when going through STV.
---
blackout is always good
---
Likely to get Blacksmith or Engineer up, but the increase in stats from a BS item is nothing compared to alch potions at a lower level
---
But, let em crash the ore market, it will be lovely for us
---
For interaction with nps and looting, have you tried the keybinding for "interact with target?" That couple with the leatrix auto quest accept/turn ins and faster auto loot is a decent solution. Thanks for the update!
---
Yeah, I've read it on reddit very long ago, although I can't find any official statement about it... but it makes sense after all (even tho I wouldn't have done that).
---
Needs to be sleeker
---
Feral is great for leveling but not quite as strong in pvp as some of the more pure classes. Great at escaping, not as great at getting kills. Not fair ones anyway. :)
---
I have several IRL social groups and a big guild with hundreds of people on it all trying to communicate on what server we're playing on. We all decided on Herod and made our characters, and it was a pain establishing this and communicating it with everyone our entire social reach knows is playing wow. Doing all of that again to get everyone to re-roll on Stalaag is just a huge pain. It's our official backup server, but what happens when blizzard announces another new server in a week and stalaag is full? Our group has to do this again?
---
Lost it after despacito.
---
I don't give a fuck what you want. I don't want to play with you either, how about you go play a different game where you can go on about how much you support baby killing etc. thanks bye

Where is carrot on a stick from again?
---
Do you have death raven on you head ?
---
It’s not like this has ever been said many times before.
---
You are right.
---
Plus it's important for everyone to understand that the queues won't behave the same before then after layering is removed.
---
With layering in, the login servers can dump new players into the next open layer. The queue numbers will decrease fast. But when layering is gone, the queue is not going to be stopping by 200 players per second like during name reservations.
---
The game world in vanilla was not designed to handle 10k people all on the same layer. Even if the servers hardware can handle it, the zones cannot. The queue will be slower, a lot slower. If it's not, playing will be rather unpleasant.

What is the best dps ability rotation for hunter at 60? Including melee hits if viable?
---
Even the development version was solid! Glad to see an official release before launch!
---
This is really bad. Explains why this subreddit is 100% useless casual garbage now.
---
Holidays were great, brewfest is a favorite. However do not believe it is going in.
---
If you’ve looked on the blizz forums there are people losing their minds over ClassicLFG
---
STD
---
That idea sounds more about the players experiencing the story and lore of a wonderfully crafted universe. And less about releasing games at perfect intervals to maximize profit. So sorry thats going to be a no from Blizz dawg.
---
it is unlikely and even if they did it would be a server effort, they will liely have their fan boys gathering shit for them to get ready, and this is assuming that they all manage to level and reach cap in time.
---
My question is why would they let it get so full in the first place ("massively overpopulated") as to need a warning?
---
And why are we reluctantly agreeing to layering if it is still going to result in log in queues of 10,000+ players?
---
I’m aware. I’m just saying that people don’t want any type of helpful group creation addon. I think it’s stupid and maybe when they go a full day of not getting a group they’ll change their minds.
---
Well at atleast you expanded your programming skills. That's something.
---
and they will ALL be full on launch day.
---
There is not a raid comp with 30 dps, i'm sorry but that is wrong.  Thats not enough healers or tanks.
---
I thought everybody is flagged on pvp servers?
---
This gives me chills. God, Classic is finally here guys. After all those years its here
---
No. You shouldn't be willing to miss out on *at least* 6% total damage AND Combustion just to save yourself some gold. Every other class has to deal with their optimal PVE spec not being an optimal PVP spec. You're just going to have to suck it up.
---
Especially early on in neutral zones, stealth is going to be a god send, in PvP realms at least
---
ZF
---
Lol, the old Blizzard wasn't any better. The TBC introductions quests were a mess with its handling of Kael'Thas and his faction
---
No, it's not. It's already more full than any server ever was on Vanilla wow.
---
The alliance before yesterday had data only up to level 17. It now has the full 1-60. We haven’t announced anything because we are still implementing some community requested features like saving/search
---
Yes, with Unbridled Wrath you make slightly more rage then without Unbridled Wrath.
---
this but unironically
---
5 hours of pvp a day sounds plausible over a long period. The difference between getting rank 10 and getting rank 12, is that the lowest bracket to hit rank 10 is like bracket 4-5 which is only top 6% of players, that you can hit very easily. But the minimum requirements to hitting rank12 is bracket3, which is top 2-3% of players. I've seen the caps of bracket3 be around 500k honor, with an avg honor gain of 10-15k per hour, that's minimum 35 hours a week, which is just barely doable with 5 hours daily. You might have to extend your 5 hours a day a little bit at the end.
---
europeans don't  have to work and they all live like 20 ~~miles~~ km from each other
---
AV rolls out with BWL, so you're not speccing Fire until 2 Phases *after* that.
---
k
---
They also have an answer like mages for many situations. It is still heavily dependent on the player behind the avatar ofc.
---
It depends what you want to instance PvP I won't rank them in any particular order but the best for for each situation.
---
2s - warrior warlock rogue mage 
---
3s - warrior warlock rogue mage
---
5s - warrior shaman mage 
---
Battlegrounds are objective based not dps based.
---
Warsong never a bad idea to have a stealth or two rogue/mage/druid defending the flag. Offense you'll want warriors/warlocks for control of middle fighting. 
---
AB your best bet is to have a stealth or two rogue/mage/druid defend the first flag. Send a 3v3 team to lumber mill druid/warlock/warrior or priest/mage/rogue and the rest rush middle once you hold those 3 points against similar geared/skilled players you will almost never lose 
---
Premade AV you will want some stealth classes to take towers rogue/mage/druid and 35 ish people rushing the boss which is more PvE than PvE.
---
So as you can see a recurring theme the top useful dps for PvP is going to be anyone not a hunter or paladin. I never did any PvP in classic on a max naxx character but i did do a lot of PvP in full gladiator merciless and vengeful gladiator gear. With 3 gladiator titles.
---
You can by partying with someone and having him kill the centaurs, you gain the positive rep but don't get the negative rep penalty, as long as you don't participate in the killing.
---
I don't know if this would unlock the other centaur clan quests though.
---
You fucking fanbois are the worst
---
Fury dual wield is awful for levelling. You'll have a 24% miss chance and no talents or easily attainable gear to reduce that. Missing is worse as a warrior than any other class, because you not only do no damage, you get no resource.  
---
Also, fury two handed isn't as strong on the BETA currently because you can't sit to force an enrage proc.  
---
Generally speaking the way you go should be 5 points in cruelty, then down arms. Respec at 40 to drop cruelty for Mortal Strike.
---
I would say go warrior and make some alts
---
They released a blue post yesterday.... and it does not matter about the vanilla wow part.  
---
but whatever, you are not going to agree.
---
I for one welcome our Scandinavian overlords.
---
Thank you! Finally another PvE player. I played PvP on a private server and couldn't handle getting ganked. 
---
I have limited play time every night. I'd like to play in a chill environment.
---
Most of those would be great Thex sound bites too
---
Okay lets circle back around. Let's say Herod gets shut down. You and your friend Joe had characters there.
---
You are forcibly moved to Server A.
---
Joe is forcibly moved to Server B.
---
You obviously want to play with Joe, so you go to Server B to remake your character, and whoops: your previous name is already taken because someone got there faster.
---
Now the entire point of the name reservation was moot.
---
Is that more clear?
---
Was he passed out before the song kicked in?
---
If only other server names would have better names people would gladly move to them.
---
Was as believer in BFA... 
---
Then I played the classic beta... 
---
Now all I want to do is play classic wow.
---
Now I need the entire unplugged album!
---
Arms has the best talents (sweeping strikes/tactical mastery), is the easiest to rank dungeons with and some of the most important stuff people talk about for fury (sit/crit) doesn’t work anyway.  Arms is also the best for pvp.
---
EverQuest was top tier. It was little things in EQ that WoW missed the mark on. For example, there was a lot of down time in EverQuest which meant you had time to chat with your team. In WoW, people tend to always be in a hurry. The instant LFG and raid queue systems kinda destroyed the social aspect of recruiting your party.
---
Classic WoW and Everquest weren't hyper focused on balance either. This made loot special and could make your character unique. The hyper normalization of items sucked the fun out of WoW. Just look at the 2 handed drops from Sunken Temple if you want a comparison of before and after normalization.
---
Everquest had some bad mechanics which led to interesting socialization such as 8 hour world spawns. I remember there being a queue for a book from Highkeep where everyone sat and chatted until it was their turn to kill the npc. This kept the game social. Also, people would call out when they saw rare spawns so people who needed the kill could get it. Fights weren't with taking if you didn't need the loot. Combat was slow and experience even slower. This meant you got a chance to learn the zones and get acquainted with people in your level range. WoW streamlined that too much and it hampered the social aspect.
---
Last but not least, Everquest added hidden rooms, passable walls, and multiple paths through their open dungeons. Warcraft is highly on rails without a lot of decision making for exploring and dungeoning. There are some exceptions such as BRD, but Everquest really got the exploration feel right.
---
Overall, Warcraft got a lot of things right and took it's rightful place as king of MMO's. There are still some things they could have learned from their predecessors. I'll never forget 80 players coming together to take down a world boss to help a rogue on their epic weapon quest line. Everyone accepted personal risk of losing precious xp to help someone they might not every have grouped with. That's social gaming.
---
Because people are dumb and contrarian instead of just accepting that there's a pet who's a cut above the rest.
---
Could use www.iswowclassicout.com too
---
That's just the order of what hotkeys you're pressing though. Mechanically it's no more "clunky" today than it was 15 years ago.
---
That's weird..
---
Lol. That comment
---
&gt; I would rather read in game quest text at normal speed then watch machinima. 
---
Retail vs Classic hate is very real.
---
Gonna be wading through a meter of meatballs just to get to the AH.
---
It was pvp but durotar is horde controlled so they have to flag up or attack him
---
nah it's actually just so predictable that if a hunter is running on me im already prepared to jump away from the trap. Scatter shot essentially turns me into a critter in terms of trapping which is much easier than a moving target
---
This reminds me of the SWTOR vs WoW christmas song :D
---
I just figured out how to install it, there’s no clear way to do so from the battlenet application
---
Blessing of salvation will reduce all threat you generate by 30% so that's a start. Some tanks are better than others at generating threat.

I believe i saw something similar to a LFR tool and i don't think i've seen a bluepost about it yet if they would ban those addons or not.
---
Would be cool if chromie acknowledged that we restarted with classic, since technically she would know.
---
Wow, sharp looking art work. Yours?
---
Well, **HE** is flagged by being in the Horde-specific zone, but the **Horde** aren't flagged in the Horde-specific zone he's in. They are safe, unless/until they attack the flagged Alliance, at which point combat is mutual.
---
Nerds, nerds! Please, calm yourselves
---
Yea, feel like blizzard maybe should have released reforged before classic, cus now I won't get around to playing reforged for a year or two.
---
Stalagg will be full/high well before launch
---
Maybe 8/40 priests, if I remember right our MC groups had 10-15 healers

Holidays in Vanilla:
---
Compiled from wikis, gamepedia, and Classic Wowhead:
---
Patch 1.2 Feast of Winter Veil  
---
The holidays are here and the citizens of Azeroth are celebrating the occasion with festive decorations and winter time activities. Keep an eye out for some fun and exciting surprises throughout the world!
---
Patch 1.3 Noblegarden  
---
(Couldn’t find a summary from old patch notes.)
---
Patch 1.4 Children’s Week  
---
Children’s Week is celebrated in Orgrimmar and Stormwind City at the start of May and lasts for a week. It is a time to give back to the innocents of war: the orphans!
---
Patch 1.6 Darkmoon Faire  
---
A gathering of the exotic from around the world and beyond, Silas Darkmoon has brought together the Darkmoon Faire as a celebration of the wondrous and mysterious found in Azeroth. While the Faire spends most of their time in parts unknown, they do stop from time to time in Mulgore and Elwynn forest. When the faire is on its way barkers will stop by Ogrimmar and Ironforge to announce its arrival.
---
Patch 1.7 Stranglethorn Fishing Tournament  
---
The Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza is a grand new event set along the coasts of Stranglethorn Vale. Early on the appointed day, friendly neighborhood goblins will visit Ironforge and Orgrimmar to inform aspiring anglers of the grand tournament and give instructions. At the appropriate time, the shout will ring out across Stranglethorn to bait your hooks and cast your lines!
---
Patch 1.7 PvP holidays for bonus honor  
---
Battleground “holidays” have been added to Warsong Gulch, Alterac Valley and Arathi Basin. Holidays occur during most weekends, starting on Thursday night at midnight and continuing until Tuesday morning. During a holiday, emmissaries from that Battleground will be found in the major cities, and honor/faction rewards for performing objectives in that battleground are increased.
---
Patch 1.8 Hallow’s End  
---
When the decorations of Hallow’s End light up Azeroth’s cities, you know there’s mischief afoot! Seek special vendors in Orgrimmar or Ironforge and get your hands on treats! Aid a sick orphan in a little trick-or-treating! Deathcaller Yanka, attending the Forsaken’s Wickerman Festival, and Sergeant Hartman of Southshore are seeking your aid in keeping the enemy out of their holiday affairs – are you up to the challenge?
---
Patch 1.9 Love is in the Air  
---
Are you looking for love? All of Azeroth soon will be! As winter draws to a close the races are starting to seek that special someone. Be on the lookout for amorous individuals! Put on that special perfume or cologne, express your love, and receive gifts in return! Prepare yourself… love will soon be in the air!
---
Patch 1.11 Midsummer Fire Festival  
---
The Harvest Festival is possibly in there, as I found some notes in the wiki about the holiday being on October 6, 2006 coinciding with the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival/ Korean Chuseok, but I can’t be sure.
---
The Lunar Festival is possibly in there, as I found some notes in the wiki about the holiday being on January 29, 2006 coinciding with the Chinese Lunar New, but I also can’t be sure.
---
I don’t recall them from my vanilla days, but it’s possible that I just missed them.
---
aliance is weak, that's why they need fear ward :)
---
you are talking about endgame and raiding. why is leveling then a concern for you? you do it only once until you are 60
---
The official WG policy is to say it is random, but it is not.  I don't have evidence for it other than old hersay.  
---
However, some simple anecdotal stats help validate it.  My account is a 56% WR free-to-play, solo account.  
---
Maybe 1 in 100 games there is someone with more performant stats on my team.
---
The standard is to go 2hander Fury until you hit level 40, and then switch to Arms for Mortal Strike. You will utilize the hamstring kite method throughout.
---
However, you can do 2handed Arms straight off the bat if you like, it won't hinder you. Personally, I recently leveled 1-60 on a private server and I did Dual Wield Fury the whole time. It isn't optimal considering you don't have a lot of hit%, but it worked fine for me, and I also did a lot of 5man dungeons and I would either tank or top the charts as DPS. It was extremely rare for somebody to out-DPS me which was surprising since I think a 2hander build would have done better.
---
Yeah, I guess I could've worded my sarcasm a little better. I'm just irked that this all could've been handled better and caused far less anxiety.
---
I watched 15 of a stream to see what it was actually like and within that he actually said his teeth are so rotted and beyond repair he needs surgery for what I am guessing full veneer replacements. Like since he just couldn't brush his teeth and or stop drinking 20g of soda a day. I knew he was bad when I saw he drinks Pepsi.
---
Sadly yes, I agree.  There's no sandbox.  No lasting incentives for WPVP, Raiding, Etc.  Once the content is done, its done.  The game would need to be completely different.  There would need to be something to fight over; resources, rankings, prestige, but it would also need to be extremely expensive to upkeep, with risk of loss.  Like an economy with supply and demand.  Supply in WoW (gear) doesn't have an economy 'dump' so eventually everyone will have BiS. 
---
If someone's gear could be looted from them in PvP but it also had a slow decay and then broke (so it doesn't last forever), that would be your dump.  Now imagine you/your guild has the option to craft/make Teir 1 - 3 gear.  T3 would require the most resources, it would make you very powerful, but you run the risk of losing it if you die.  Maybe your guild doesn't have enough resources to justify making only T3 for everyone; it wouldn't be efficient, so for now you stick to T2 until your guild wins some territory and has more resource income.  This would create revolving supply and demand.  Creating a demand/incentive for what you're fighting over (resources).
---
Art by Jung-Hun Joo [artstation](https://www.artstation.com/kveldulv)
---
You didn't even mention Riposte! Such an OP ability, 150% weapon damage for 10 energy with a disarm is ridiculous.
---
It’s funny because it’s technically using the same engine at original wc3.
---
Arms, skip impale and get one more talent in parry. Make sure you have 5/5 tactical mastery at lvl 29, not before then. At level 30 you should be able to get Sweeping strikes
---
Well in WoD I think they freed up all names on accounts that hadn’t been logged into for like 3+ years at the current time
---
Boar is great, owl/carrion bird is better imo. Screech is really strong.
---
Should I play a priest or a shaman for pvp healing? The two friends I’ll mostly be playing with are both playing warriors.
---
I understand how broken WF totem is with one warrior, let alone two. However, the main question I can’t decide on is: if giving up a magical dispel and bubbles is too big of a set back for pvp healing?
---
Any recommendations or thoughts?
---
Unless I'm misunderstanding their wording here, "more characters" doesn't have to mean more simultaneous players since you could create three different characters on the same server (and might have if you wanted to reserve three names for whatever reason).
---
Going on that theory, Blizzard are the worst saboteurs in history. Layering is objectively the best path forward from a risk management perspective. It's clearly meant to make the community aspect of the game better.
---
Cauthonluck on twitch did a horde speedrun 1-45 which might help. It’s in his recent vids. I havent watched it yet, but others recommended watching it.
---
Herod will still be much more full. Because bliz didn’t lock servers at ‘Full’ there is a big difference.
---
I'm gonna say it, Whatever class you put effort and time into. Aka play what you want.
---
Mages aren't brought for their damage output. They are just insanely strong for CC/DPS/KITE abilities.
---
Warrior would definitely be at the top but you can be kited for days in bg's but in AV you're not gonna do anything really because 1 charge gets you focused by all the range and you die.
---
Gotta do something to stay entertained for the next 9 days.
---
I hope for livestreams of delusional people in equally delusional guilds, trying MC in greens. I can't wait. 
---
I will stop playing Classic for the massive amounts of laughing that those livestreams will provide.
---
c[_]
---
No I actually agree. There are things Im super hyped about classic wow(Server communitiessss), but the difficulty isnt one of them.
---
Saw someone in another thread yesterday saying retail mythic raiders were in for a "Rude awakening" rofl. Like what?
---
Eh, seen [this](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835)?
---
You're paranoid.  He'll be playing with all his other streamer  buddies.
---
They were selling in the Beta?! Fuck me, they are desperate.
---
They already stated they are going to have the regular realm size once they get rid of layering. So just so you herod fan boys know your que will most likely never end. And get even worse if the pop stays
---
Hmm, good to know. Thanks for that input.
---
You can already login... that won't be a problem.
---
Well, I have to add it manually, so I have to get hold of the email. But I don't want to use it to annoy people unwillingly
---
This was before they announced Fae, please stop making statements you know nothing about.
---
The more you talk about him, the more ideas you give him
---
I think so (I'm a Warlock)
---
Playing classic made me love my warlock even more. The talents, the trainers in the basement - outcasts, grimoires to teach my demons who hate me new ranks, the need to party up and chat... it felt like playing an MMO
---
What a superb owl.
---
Lol? You're getting PoM, Arcane Power, and 3% crit as a trade. Not exactly that big of a DPS loss.
---
Also, not everyone is an elitist prick. With the exception of a few specific bosses, Vanilla raids aren't that hard. You don't need to min/max to clear MC. 
---
And honestly, I would never join a guild filled with people with your attitude. I'd rather do slower progression, in a fun environment, than be hounded over every minor detail just for the sake of getting my pixels 1 week earlier than the rest.
---
This video is outdated. He also seems like a nice considerate guy, I don't think he would do something just to spite a lot of people.
---
Yeah nothing wrong with trying to do it efficiently, but like the other poster said, it is on rails and all feels very samey.
---
There won't be long queues thanks to layering.
---
how is that fanboy lmao
---
&gt; another 2% from a scope.
---
Biznicks is 3%. And you can find the other 3% in gear, meaning you don't have to take Surefooted and can instead go BM for even more damage.
---
I thought rage was based on damage dealt, not flat gain?
---
Slow means instant attacks hit harder
---
Read up where? I was quoting his last comment made on the topic 2 years ago. I remember hearing about him getting a job and leaving due to lack of freedom but couldn't find anything about that.

King earns more than both though:
---
https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial
---
While Activision Publishing has no *direct* influence on Blizzard, the holding company *does*. And it so happens that the holding company's board only, basically, has people in it who likely have never played a video game in their life and only make decisions based on financial reports. And the chairman and CEO are Activision execs:
---
https://www.activisionblizzard.com/board-of-directors
---
Given Kotick's massive influence and past statements about games i would bet that the board is making a lot of decisions on each company's behalf, including Blizzard. Lets just say i was not surprised at all at Morhaime and other former Blizzard greats leaving.

Adding to that, while Activision and Blizzard have seen significant yoy drops, King has remained fairly stable in a rather tumultuous period for the business as a whole. I would not be surprised *at all* to find out that the board has been pushing for King-style business practices even more over the past year (and moving forward) in order to satisfy the shareholders.
---
TLDR: Yes, you are correct that Activision *itself* has negligible impact on Blizzard, but Activision-Blizzard has massive influence on Blizzard.
---
Adding to this. People fucking despise rogues in vanilla. They see you attacking a mob they will 99% of the time gank you.
---
Yeah sure, but the question wasn't phrases as 1 hander vs 2 handers, it was about weapon speed.  Even if you went dual wield, they would be better as slow 1 handers.
---
Because Activision blizzard is a prime example of never going back on their word...
---
Yes but that doesn't annoy you on your phone every hour
---
Seeing your tat has got me seriously thinking about getting one. I've played the game since vanilla, made life long friendships in both RL and online, my wife and I both enjoy playing, and I've learned many life lessons from wow.
---
Or he’s playing with friends...
---
Oh my bad, I was indeed a bit misinformed, I'll delete my post in order to not stir up unnecessary worries. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Hey man, I was hoping you could maybe help me with a question! I was heavily considering mage (for the free food and portals) and rogue, obviously because of the stealth and various utility. If I were to go with a rogue, which class do you think performs best if I want to do PvE mainly, but also enjoy PvP without a handycap? I heard mostly combat and asssasination is good? Or subtelty? Any ideas?
---
Thanks for all the answers i think its best for me to take a druid later on its just so hard to pick a class :/
---
Female Orc Lock cuz I'm feelin sexy AF
---
That's a noun...
---
Full would mean current player count. Not characters created. How hard is it to understand.
---
If you're not running Destruction you're betraying your namesake.
---
Yes you do keep the GM title
---
Fuck that. Min/Max all you want, but raiding in tier sets is absolutely possible.
---
i think the idea with having a new talent slot every 10 levels is quite good. they could nicely pair that with the free choice of abilities that we have for the pvp talents. create like 30-40 talents to choose from per class and have them all available starting from level 10, but a level 10 character only has 1 slot where he can pick a talent, whereas a level 120 can freely pick 12 talents from the whole pool. this would allow a player to decide how many aoe, single target or support talents he would like. it'd also give new players a lot of abilities to try out right at level 10 and could make it so that you actually feel stronger while progressing through the leveling experience with new talent slots unlocking frequently.
---
I think the issue lies in the fact that streamers don't "need" to broadcast themselves playing. It's a fully conscious choice in which they value their own paycheck over the the potential dissatisfaction of thousands of other players.

Yeah I’m listening

you got green hills 6 mate? i got extra 10 and 12.

If I did it with my salary, which isn't huge it would cost well over $2000. Considering a fast one does it in 120 hours it's cheap

you dont work for blizzard genius, reduce amount of salt intake please)
---
A dude in another comment said he's going hemo/prep for the STV phase.
---
That's prob a good move imo
---
Oh nice, will look into it. Although I won't have much time to test it until Classic comes out.
---
&gt; It has no effect over any other aspect in wow
---
Grinding pet battles literally makes your character stronger, how is that "no effect" ?
---
I'm with you, I never played DPS really. Tank and healer queues in lfg were so much shorter it's worth being a little more alert, because that's all it is. A little more alert
---
That leather helm is on point haha!!
---
Because you can't pet-battle between boss pulls.
---
I bet the gnolls are gonna be camped as fuck by mages aoe power leveling alts/guildies
---
Thanks a lot!  All the numbers and mechanics in the beta right now aren't \*supposed\* to be subject to change.  Blizzard has cross referenced the live 1.13 client (what we will play Classic on) with their in-house 1.12 client with all the old original code.  Calculating stuff in game is fine, sans my crude health regen experiment :P  Especially with the next episodes we'll be dealing with a lot of very specific numbers, but I'll be backing those up with Blizzard employee quotes and such!
---
What is multi boxers? Im new to WoW/mmos in general i dont know the terms.

Fanbois down voting,  so typical and expected,  but thanks :)

Ahh. A Naxxramas 12 days. Can also use 4 horsemen 😋

I guess it's this part? Adding little cute nuances to 'help' players explore the world, etc. Classic doesn't need or want that

People are way ahead of ya and been developing them during beta 
---
they were an extensive part of the game in original wow. some of the add-ons eventually became features of the game added by blizzard
---
I haven't done pet battles in years but I have no problem with them. They make the world feel slightly more alive imo. If they add them to Classic+ then I think they'd have to remove the XP granting aspect imo.
---
Never said or implied that they were.
---
Even in BiS gear, ret paladin struggles to do half the DPS of a similarly-geared rogue/warrior/mage/warlock.
---
Yeah the level of grinding people do these days is insane, I kept up with mana stuff and a handful of protection pots for bosses like Huhuran and Loatheb only. But I guess it's to be expected if you're still interested in playing it continuously after all these years.
---
Not 20 /played. They need 20 days to get it done, you're not the only customer
---
Would you rather the overpopulated server have login queues of 10,000 or login queues of 30,000? That's why layering is necessary. There is, however, a cap on the total amount of layers a realm will have which is why Herod will have 10k+ queues. If there was no cap on the layers it would just completely exacerbate the situation for when layering is scheduled to be removed.
---
Login queues are a good thing, cause it will convinced people to populate other servers.
---
i would argue that it adds more value to pets , this will increase cost on AH messing with the economy.
---
Rage is based on dammage dealt. You want a fast weapon for threat. Getting the smooth rage generation ( rather than large but chunky generation) is a bonus. 
---
The faster the weapon the more you can heroic strike which is your top 3 threat ability.
---
Wuts a paladin? Is it like the generic dollar store version of a shaman?
---
Of course they do.  But they exist to do raids or pvp.  You get your mount so you can get to them faster/do them better.  The same with consumables.  You don't farm a consumable and sit with it in Ironforge.....you use it in raids or for pvp.
---
Ergo if you weren't raiding or doing pvp, you would have no reason to get a consumable, would you?
---
Perhaps a more accurate description is that raids/pvp and everything surrounding them are 95% of them game.  The other 5% is for odd stuff that people do like farming novelty/cosmetic stuff.
---
You mean it doesn't need quest like the missing diplomat, the legend of stalvan, the schyte of elune, (...), to explore the world?
---
Classic already has those

If you make sure to go out of your way to pick up Ghost Mushrooms, Mara can be *very* lucrative. I always just vendored all the blues that Princess dropped; I'm not sure how much they'd be worth as shards.
---
I usually enter from purple side and pick up a few guaranteed ghost mushrooms along the way. Then may my way to Princess from there. It definitely adds some time to the run, but I find that if I just focus on killing Theradras repeatedly, I get the "you have entered too many instances" issue.
---
Yea $200 would be crazy cheap I would expect fresh 60s to be around 4 to 500 and really heard to be 1k+ if you have something like rd whatever people are willing to pay
---
Oof, didn't know that... What areas are full on free pvp? The majority?
---
Found the Ret Paladin
---
Subbed before I asked the question but glad to hear it!   
---
My favorite thing about OSRS was that it revived content creation for Runescape and so far it seems that Classic has done the same for WoW. It'll be awesome to see where the trend goes once the game is actually launched and its own culture and history form
---
I'm playing on Herod Alliance. :) Madlad the Holy Paladin :)
---
I know a few people on retail that have really no interest in Classic that reserved names. It really didn't take much effort and they are already subscribed, so why not?
---
I wonder if the stat squish they are trying to do is for adding back talent trees. I one can only hope.
---
and to be clear, "ehh stealth is alright" isn't going to be a good enough answer
---
as a rogue you will spend a LOT of time in stealth, mostly avoiding extra mobs and making your way to quest objectives, but also being a sneaky bitch and either avoiding non-consentual pvp situations or creating them
---
Are you really that ignorant? He doesn't want retail wow endgame, he said he wants classic wow endgame.
---
Well you're talking about solo'ing, so in that case I'll say Troll.
---
Shadowguard is a 2nd DoT basically. It has great scaling and no 3 min cooldown unlike DP. It had amazing uses beyond just being a blackout proc. 
---
Your analysis on Hex is a little off too. Yea Druids and Mages can remove it, but usually Druids are on the flag and any Mage wasting GCD's on removing that isn't hurting you. Plus in group PvP scenario's, Warlocks are throwing up curses too. Finally, you will only ever use rank 1 hex for 35 mana, you can spam that shit on every enemy you find. Priests &amp; Paladins not being able to remove it means you will have a majority of time with it being up over it not.
---
And by saying all that, I'm not getting tribal and saying Undead must be shit. They're two different but tasty flavors with great advantages and disadvantages. If you're against someone who can't remove a disease, fuck yea use DP. But if someone is wailing on you anyway? I'd love some good damage Shadowguards with a chance to stun them.
---
How does it make your character stronger? I'm level 11, but so far I seen no difference between my character having no pets and having 5
---
You didn't even search it
---
Yes it is. Layering allows the realm caps to be raised by spinning up multiple physical servers to support one realm. Not only is that how it works, that's its main purpose.
---
Am I the only one who expected the Skyrim intro at 2:42?
---
Alright, thank you very much :)
---
They released 3 est PvP servers and have added one more...
---
Only very little areas are controlled by a faction (mostly the starting areas to protect low lvls) so you will be able to pvp in almost every lvl 12-15+ area.
---
Saw this quality owl on frontpage. good meme
---
My friend did something really stupid and decided to briefly edit his character during the initial rush. In the 10 seconds it took to do that, he lost the name.
---
What the blizzard employees lost sight of along the way is the the community dynamics and social behavior. A group of friends encased in a larger community is what Classic WoW memorable and fun. People were literally forced to interact and work together to defeat difficulties of the grouping system, to defeat raid bosses, to withstand world pvp, to gain gear, to trade professional skills, to share game knowledge, to travel, etc. Through this difficulty strong bonds were created, server reputations were beholden and treasured and guilds thrived. 
---
When they began to deteoriate all aspects of the game that created community the game died. While retail might be a better game from a software development perspective it's abyssmal when compared from a communal one. Grouping has become outsourced to automatic systems, raid bosses can be cleared with little coordination or effort, gear has been normalized, game knowledge abundant on websites, traveling made convenient, world pvp irrelevant, server reputation broken by realm xfers. There is no reason for people to interact anymore and thats simply something these dunces cant comprehend.
---
1. We’re not talking about MC. No one is speccing Fire in MC.
---
2. My trade was for 21 points in Arcane only. If you’re going all the way to AP, you’re not going to have much of anything in Fire.
---
High Elves and Night Elves are not the same thing. The Highborne were just what the Night Elf aristocracy called themselves.
---
If there are enough people on each team, its more important to end up in the better team than to be Good yourself. As this is random people will end up close to 50%.
---
Yep, same here. BDO came close because of how good the combat was, but bad management ruined that one. Out of the western mmos, I tried all of them after Cata but none really stuck. They all felt like bad WoW clones (because they were) or games that were alright but got replaced by WoW (because they did).
---
It has to do with raid locations. IF was more of a central location for Alliance and more efficient way to get to Onyxia, MC, BWL and all high level 5 mans we were farming for gold and mats. 
---
AH being there also helped.
---
I would suggest https://youtu.be/bbQ4xI7XEUw .
---
And I would also suggest not using twitch but putting them directly in your add-on folder. The twitch app won't always update your addons and sometimes won't even recognize some of your addons
---
No worries my dude.
---
I didn't realize it granted XP, I thought it only gave XP to the pet. Yes, the extra XP is a problem, but calling it on of the "things that ruined wow" it seem extreme
---
There is a level requirement for it
---
Help I can't decide whether I want to play Pantheon or Star Citizen in 2050!
---
Which is why we don't need pets to incentive something that quests and professions already do
---
IT is more than just the guys taking help desk tickets for your shitty laptop bud. It’s also the people developing software products and deploying infrastructure to support them.  Sorry to have to shatter your worldview.
---
The axe is a lot better than both the sword and the mace.  
---
The mace is alright stat wise (3.4 speed), but mace specialisation for a warrior is just bad compared to the others, especially for levelling.  
---
The sword is fast (2.9 speed), it's so fast that even with AP normalisation it falls far behind the axe for damage.  
---
Even if you head into the game solo all the mobs you kill for the Whirlwind Axe are mobs you will be killing anyway for different quests. So there will always be other players around who you can group with. Heck you technically don't even need to kill the highest level mobs you could just buy the charms they drop off the AH if you really wanted to. Regardless though people doing the  Myzrael quest chain will be there to help you out, or other warriors.  
---
Also, Bonebiter (also an axe) is technically better than the Whirlwind axe and as Alliance you have access to that. Only hard part is doing two Scarlet Monastary runs, but thats probably advisable anyway.
---
Love it.
---
Very nice thank you for the information.
---
Someone that has a program link all key inputs across multiple clients. Imagine 5 shaman with all the same keybinds, perfectly stacked, in a party, and essentially one shotting all basic mobs.
---
You honestly think Blizzard is dumb enough to count 3 character reserves as 3 individuals who will play on that server? Come on man, there is probably some algorithm that counts 3 characters created as 1 account, and 1 character created as 1/3 of a person since it's not guaranteed they would be playing on that server if they have names reserved on multiple servers.
---
Hamstring kiting does seem fun. I think I'm leaning toward Arms, since I'll probably tank a few dungeons along the way, and coming from Druid stancedancing should feel pretty natural.
---
Agreed. You had to expertly navigate to minimize the back and forth, now the game minimizes it for you.
---
I distinctly remember my poorly optimized route that made me run back and forth between the Darkshire and Raven Hill 4 times more than I needed to because of poor planning, but here I sit typing that memory because it was MEMORABLE. Played my way through part of legion and couldn't tell you one thing that happened because it was essentially auto-pilot while questing.
---
Fuck that such a hassle lol rather void that bitch and get sacrifice for world PvP
---
I remember that nobody used this because it would almost never proc.
---
Filled with tourists.
---
After playing stealth classes I feel so naked playing non stealth.  "5 players are coming to help why cant I just stealth away?"
---
Very interesting. I had no idea vendor values used to be high. Thankfully, fishing is still incredibly lucrative :)
---
This is fantastic! It gets really good in the middle. 
---
It's funny how this can remind me so much of both WoW and Zelda at the same time.
---
I’m with you, fellow boomer.
---
There would be more demand, but also more people have the ability to sell those. Either way it affects the economy of the game. You are right about this one, but, as I replied to ApothecaryAlfyn, saying it ruined wow because of that its overblowing it
---
The solution is what Blizzard is doing.
---
Herod is overpopulated, so they are opening Stalagg.  People have a choice: stay on Herod and potentially have a long queue, or move to Stalagg or another realm.
---
Blizzard will likely open more servers and give people more of a choice come launch.
---
I don’t know anything about twitch but curse or wowinterface are my go to places
---
welcome to reddit, where a fair warning trying to tell the community at large the facts... gets downvoted by people who dont want to hear it  
---
just wait until launch when all you idiots eat your words... this launch is going to be a catastrophe with the population issues
---
He's not going to agree because you are fundamentally wrong.
---
A "medium" full server in classic WoW has many more players in it that a "Full" server did in Vanilla.  Blizzard has explained this, both myself and the guy above you reminded you of this and yet you are just sticking your head in the sand and pretending that truth doesn't exist.
---
Your statement that "The new server is empty so far" is categorically incorrect.  When you say something stupid, don't double down.
---
Vanilla took out the things that were annoying, but not hardcore. level loss on death really being the only one at that point because DAOC had already removed the 'all yer shits on yer corpse' from previous games. City of heroes gave us our first taste of random instances in an mmorpg. 
---
What vanilla still had though was that need to build a community and class identity. Neither exist in modern games. Shit, look at what ESO just did with scalebreaker - every class that goes magicka uses the same 3-4 skills that are NOT CLASS SKILLS now for dps. bad design decision.
---

Maybe if everyone that rolled on Herod was f5ing the forums constantly then it would’ve been apparent. 8 hours notice is not a very long time.
---
Venruki has basically just been playing the Beta, while Greatwizard has been playing private servers for years now, and are more used to using every ability to it's fullest potential.
---
Imp. Blizzard is an invaluable tool if you get in a 1vX scenario and need a slow for a rogue.
---
Imp. Arcane Missiles is to have reliable damage that won't get pushed back when you're getting wailed on, so instead of trying to take 3.5 seconds to get off a frostbolt, you can channel Arcane Missiles in their face.
---
You don't have to 'flag up' just accidentally hit him and you'll be flagged, in a Contested Zone everyone is flagged no matter what, usually the original starting zone and the next zone after are safe everything after is contested.
---
(Nelf) Teldrassil, Darkshore - Alliance controlled
---
(Gnome/Dwarf) Dun Morogh, Loch Modan - Alliance controlled
---
(Human) Elwynn Forest, Westfall - Alliance controlled
---
(Orc/Troll) Durotar, The Barrens - Horde controlled
---
(Tauren) Mulgore, The Barrens - Horde controlled
---
(Undead) Tirisfal Glades, Silverpine Forest - Horde controlled
---
Every other zone is a Contested (obviously excluding cities)
---
Will they have queues during phase one? Or just more layers?
---
For some people Classic is all about nostalgia, so remaking their first character with the same look and name plays probably a big role in that
---
Rogue is a solid choice!
---
This looks great. Thanks!
---
Depending on spec they have a couple instacast spells but really depends what you’re doing, in pvp you’ll likely use instants while getting in position to stop and cast as much as you can, in pve you’ll be pretty much straight casting unless you’re arcane blasting trash mobs (aoe instacast)
---
Perfectly
---
Clipped.
---
That's how it works *normally*. Blizzard is intentionally limiting how much layering will happen to try and move people out of the most crowded realms. If you're set on one of those realms you will have queues.
---
They hatn
---
Perfect.
---
The OP starts out by saying "it was recently revealed", even the ultra sweaties on pservers have to abide by the rules that were only guessed at by the pserver devs (14% parry chance anyone?)
---
I remember the insane aggro ranges ?? mobs have, it really skeeves you out. I remember desperately running from many an alligator in different zones.
---
Blue post says that even with layering you will have extra 10k people que
---
There's an open beta?
---
Jeesus. Hopefully they add a lot more...
---
I did the run in beta. It was like 40 mins of fun and involved two deaths.
---
Just go for it.
---
yeah there wont be a queu... because the people who dont have 20 hour days cant afford to wait 2 hours to log on so that they can log off and go deal with real life... half the games population will quit within the first week if they cant even enjoy the game - thus lowering queus by exodus
---
How was it? Never got a chance to get it working.
---
I'm actually looking forward to quitting drinking when classic comes out.  I'm so bored outside of work that i usually drink to pass the time.  Looking forward to it
---
Logging servers are not layered.
---
Its going to be a crazy first week launch.
---
This sub has really turned to shit.
---
the feels you just brought, washing over me like waves
---
I made an account on stallag and Herod! I don’t want a massive queue as I don’t have much more than two hours a day to play, so I’ll roll with whatever is faster haha
---
there was one a week ago that lasted 3 days, it ended when the name reservation started
---
For some it started way longer than that, posting about vanilla servers once every few years and getting absolutly shit on :D still cant believe its finally happening &lt;3
---
That is an INSANELY small sample size dude, and you'll have a decent amount of selection bias too by only looking at people who are committed to the game enough to roll priest. 
---
Finding groups as priest is never difficult. Period. I've played healers since vanilla and it's never been hard to find a group. The absolute "worst" case scenario is you might DPS for once instead of healing, if you want to. 
---
With all that said, it's true that priests are a popular class, and competition for gear might be a bit of a thing in raids.
---
Nope. No real money items in classic. If you want a pet, you go out and farm it.
---
I'm doing the opposite. I always played Horde, and haven't leveled an Alliance pc beyond Duskwood before, so I'm excited to experience the Alliance side this time around.
---
It seems you are the one who is misinformed my good man.
---
Nobodt is saying that. You have 2 choices a or b. Pick one and your friends can too. No new names until people move. Then they open publicly. You spread it 40 60 or better
---
Let's see, the forum for Stalagg was posted at [6:33 PM ET on Aug 14 by community manager Kaivax](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/new-wow-classic-realm-open/253667), which stated that the server would be live at 8:00 PM ET Aug 14.
---
Not sure in what world 6:33PM-&gt;8:00PM on the same day is 8 hours.
---
You get to be on the winning BG team for starters.
---
This is 5000% accurate. 
---
You cannot pull more than a few mobs of any same level until you’ve got some amazing gear. 
---
Murloc groups are death.
---
haha epicness
---
The special character wouldn’t stop me from inviting. However, I’d rather play with Uranus.
---
"Based on name reservations so far, the Shazzrah realm is looking to be **massively** overpopulated. If all existing players on this server remain there, login queues in **excess of 10,000 players** are a certainty, and possibly much higher than that."
---
That's a quote from Blizzard on the forums.
---
Thanks for your in depth replies. Very helpful!  
---
It's nice to know there's another attainable weapon if the Whirlwind Axe doesn't work out.
---
31 point talent in shadow is shadowform. VT was added in TBC
---
Actually when did the robots pop from Mt Dew? Was that at the end of Vanilla?
---
Those had red and blue fuel that you could use with those battle pets and people used to battle with those all the time in IF. Then the Blizzcon Murky that would attack the CE Fel pup.
---
Pet battles were a fun distraction back then.
---
The lame part came when they turned them onto an aspect of the game for people to focus on. Along with other things added when you start focusing attention away from core parts of the game, then things always go south

Same same, but different, but still same

---
You must have missed the "severe queues" part lol.
---
Thanks for explaining it all!
---
Played on a private server two years ago, and it was honestly the best thing, seeing this same person between the levels of 30-50, doing the same quests as me, being part of the same dungeon runs without having to seek them out
---
I have no issue with pet battles making it into 1.14 with one caveat:
---
The real money store must not rear it's ugly head. Make pets raid/pvp/exploration rewards.
---
If you dont have 2 screens you aint living right
---
Ok, thank you for letting me know.
---
Just admit you made a mistake and stop making yourself look like a damn fool.
---
Darkshore is fine, but kinda dull and dark, it always turned me off. It's up to you :)
---
&gt; i want to take in as much as possible and experience the game i missed.
---
so read quests and enjoy the journey!
---
yeah saying it killed wow is a bit much and that honor goes to the dungeon finder imo. but anything that changes game besides UI adjustments is a no go in my book. increased server pop / layering im on the fence about how i feel
---
I have been horde since 2006 and have no intention on changing. Welcome to the best faction ;)
---
oh didnt know haha. Well I still didnt want to cross it over with the other classic races from the trailer, thatswhy i blurred it in the video
---
is there way to force the target command to only target that mob exactly? I find that if any other mob is nearby that has a similar name it will select it and I'll be in combat with a mob I wasn't intending to.
---
Thicc
---
I played a rogue for a few years on a private vanilla server. It was pretty fun. I always(in retail and on private) roll a combat rogue.  The class has never been my main but fun nonetheless.
---
While WoW was not "hardcore" per se it wasn't accessible in many areas, you'd have to invest time to advance.
---
This is where the casualization kicks from in, give more people easier access. That's the "more kills for casuals" for MMORPGs.
---
Either way, if they ever decide to continue the fan service by adding new content for old WoW in 2-3 years then it would be our (players) best chance to not spiral out of control again. Wishful thinking and yet better chance than any new title not having microtransactions up the ass.
---
eh, I think there's plenty zones between 30 and 45, Desolace, Arathi, Badlands, STV, Swamp, Alterac, Dustwallow, some better, some worse, sure, but I don't think it's that bad, just that they are all over the world, getting to Badlands as horde sucks etc.
---
it's just that phase where leveling starts to really slow down and also some of those zones are first real contested territories with pvp.
---
IMO people need to stop rushing to 40-50 zones immediately and instead finish the 30-40 zones first, the 40-50 zones don't have that many quests besides Tanaris I think, but Tanaris can't carry the 40-50 range alone. Altho I don't remember Hinterlands well, wasn't it revamped? I know Dustwallow was, are we getting the revamped version?
---
are beastmaster hunters viable in raids?
---
I leveled several warriors at vanilla (tho not to 60 all the time) the one I found the best/fastest for leveling, it is the 2hand slam spammer fury.
---
here are the reasons:
---
* Fury results in best damage increase, crit, flurry, extra rage from both bloodcraze and improved berserker rage , so its good to be fury. 
---
* Fury also gives some health regen. which is good. 
---
* using 2 hander is always great leveling due to having low chance to hit dualwielding.
---
* "Damage per rage used" of Slam is the best in all skils you have. When you get improved slam, it also gets easier to cast it, as you can fit it between the mobs swings easyly so you dont get interrupted
---
* Because you are using slam, and not bloodthirst, you damage scales mostly with weapon, which is easy to find a good one. So it is easy to increase your damage done. While it is much harder to increase your overall attackpower to level that it matters for bloodthirst.
---
on the ligth of all these points, playing 2 hands, slam spamming fury ends up giving the best results while leveling. The downside is that it is not good for pvp if you are in pvp server.
---
This is so awesome :D
---
Priests usually heal tanks. If you want to heal many raid members, switch targets, dispell etc, roll a druid or a shaman
---
Arghhh
---
Prob over 10k accounts have chars on it.
---
Nha, it's this year, late december.
---
As soon as you have half decent agility you’re going to want to go marks. BM is okay for fresh 60.
---
If all players go to one server, sure. That's their own fault. Not layering's.
---
This males me wanna move to NA
---
That's good. People have no cause to complain if they all want to roll on one big superserver. WoW was never meant to be played that way.
---
I’d go skinning and herbalism. Skinning as it’s the best money maker early on. There won’t be much of an economy at first so you will be vendoring a lot and I believe skinning gets the best returns there. Herbalism for the herbs you need as a rogue.
---
Stop molesting owls
---
i plan on reading everything and not using any quest addons or guides. i want to get lost and die and enjoy every second of it
---
No, it isn't but I love your idea.
---
You're right but not every player online is looking for dungeon groups at the same time. As a healer or tank , you'll get quick groups compared to how long it'll take for say, a mage or a rogue. But yeah why not take 8 healers to a raid lol
---
#nochanges
---
I think Blizzard would lose much of the player base coming back for Classic's release if they introduced microtransactions.
---
You will be happy with this choice when it comes to Ony attunement - Just saying.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
That’s exactly it in my eyes. They took away so much, gave so little. Legion at least had a weapon to level with a talent tree, in a way. Nothing more I miss most.
---
Nobody is saying that?
---
&gt; Then allow free transfers between those servers in case your friends all wound up on a different one. Only downside is some people may lose their name.
---
Any way to get the Undead to not show bones?
---
ye, but, just you can just use Requiem mod, and most of the old leveling-reward feeling is back and even more. Oh you will die a lot on level 1 and you will fear even wolves as hell. Once i played requiem mod first time, i never looked back. I can't play skyrim without it anymore.
---
It’s like I’m wearing nothing at all
---
put a ring on it quick.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Is grinding a viable way to level? Seems like all modern MMOs questing is the only efficient way to get to max level.
---
Hopefully they offer free mig once they realise they need more realms.

**jizzes all over you**
---
IT'S MAAM
---
I had to remake THEX this morning, it was a scary time. Needless to say, Thex is now a shaman, to nearly mirrors the real Thex!
---
On the biggest server. If you roll on a server with population "Full" whose fault is that?
---
Shit ton of steak and monster nomnom.
---
You can go dual wield right at level 20. It's not as optimal as going 2handed Fury / Arms with the hamstring kite method, but it works, and it's a lot of fun in dungeons. I recently went 1-60 as Dual Wield Fury on a pserver and I was 95% of the time #1 DPS in 5mans.
---
&gt; But yeah why not take 8 healers to a raid lol
---
I honestly don't know if that's too much or too little. :)
---
I think for oblivion there was OOO (oscuro's overhoul something) mod, that returned the feeling back, wasn't it?
---
It's generally an easier life from a defensive PvP stand point. No shamans to purge spam, shock, WF crit or tremor totem your fears. No huge undead population to remove your larger CD defense. (Fear Ward exists but can be removed at least.) A general trend of slightly less Warlocks on alliance side. (Fuck felhunters lol)
---
PvE? You have to wake up and pay attention. No holy paladin's to snipe all your heals and never go OOM.
---
This is really unfortunate
---
True, according to OP's math tho you get 493 tps doing that, I haven't played vanilla in a while but I'm pretty sure you can do way more tps than that with a standard rotation. Maybe if you're super undergeared?
---
Actually, you can still HS while using every CD for BS, so higher tps.
---
I don't know dude, I just think it's very unlikely that warrior tanking rotation is going to be "spam BS" no matter the situation.
---
The reason why melee weapon skill is so good is it reduces glancing blow penalty. Ranged attacks can't glance so it's not a big deal.
---
Thanks for causing doubt as I finally settled on arms :P  
---
How hurtful to the spec do you think the "sit/crit" trick not working is?
---
Technically, it's doable, and people have done it in the stress test/beta. But because BFA profiles will include a bunch of settings for things that don't exist in Classic, things might break. 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
As I learned this week, after being called a boomer for the entire stress test, Sooners are using the term boomer for anyone who played vanilla wow. 
---
It’s popular because we keep using phrases like, “back when” .... “and when it first came out.”
---
Nothing really to do with actual age or generation. 
---
🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I've seen a few cases say skinning is great for early gold making and late game raid progression! Think it's still worth it if you don't plan on going against the hardcore Devilsaur skinning groups out there? XD
---
Skinning while levelling for extra cash. Eventually buying engineering at 60, then you can decide what moneymaking profession you want as a secondary. Skinning, herbalism and mining are the top contender and it just depends what gold making method you use.
---
Yes, and I'm saying they should make new content that isn't BC.  Why is this so hard to understand?
---
yeah like its likely there will be many hour queues on most if not all servers for at least the first week
---
i have a cleave group to level with but that basically wont be viable if half of them are stuck on login queues
---
This is tacky as hell.
---
They will add tokens but not mounts
---
Yep. I still remember going all the way to Desolace to do scarlet monastery quests
---
compared to Herod is empty, thats why blizzard told people to move.  
---
and again, im not talking about the vanilla "full server".  But whatever, you guys are not going to agree because, let it go.
---
Funny, I couldn't imagine doing it high, but I plan to have a few bottles of whiskey handy for those first 2 weeks.  Just for the RP element, you know soldiers always got drunk before battle ^(i promise thats why)
---
It is mentioned several times in the thread, but taming OTHER pets to learn skills for your pet is a BIG FUCKING DEAL.  No one wants your boar from Durotar that has no skills at level 60.
---
Perfect. Awesome job.
---
Better lock your windows tonight or your wall will be empty ;)
---
Has anyone managed to get SharedMedia_MyMedia working with Classic? That's a must for me since I'm not a huge fan of the fonts that come pre-packaged in ElvUI.
---
Bold of you to assume the ques will be as low as 4 hours
---
It's World of WARCRAFT
---
You want to avoid going herbalism and mining as you can only track either herbs or mining nodes, not both at the same time. Herbalism will help you a lot as a rogue, then its whether you want to level alchemy alongside it or take skinning for the extra gold income and swap thst to alchemy at 60.
---
Of course I’m using them... back then I was broke and in college, now I got money and a job
---
Honestly I think Darkshore is the single most efficient zone for leveling, but only if you know where everything is. But I understand that visually it's a turn off for a lot of people, that being said, it's perfectly viable to go stop off at Westfall, finish a load of quests, then return later and finish off the higher level quests in Darkshore.
---
Westfall as a general rule is fantastic because it leads you to the big Deadmines quest with some mad good rewards, but there's a lot of side questing in Redridge. It's likely to be one of the more popular zones, so if you're looking for a lot of social interaction it's probably the zone for you. There will be a ton of people grouping up to farm quest mobs and stuff.
---
What I will say, if you're rolling Druid you only actually have to go back to Moonglade for Druid quests (Cure Poison and Aquatic Form). There is a druid trainer in Stormwind City, in the Park District next to the Moonwell.
---
oh the stress test
---
Shadowbringers was so damn good, I completed most of my initial goals for it though so until 5.1 I'm gonna be all-in on Classic. After it's out I'm probably splitting some of the time.
---
That makes no sense. They're stranded theramore marines. We're on theramore Island in dustwallow
---
Having lots of space taken up by some retarded UI design is peak WoW addon usage tho, so give this man some props for staying true to the dark ages and bad taste.
---
cant wait for that chat, and layereing.. while 1 layer is being slaughtered, i might just be able to quest in peace :D
---
Yes, this would be best case scenario.  And other MMORPG's would start trying to copy that type of game instead of trying to copy modern WoW, which would lead to much better games industry wide.
---
The only viable tank class is warrior. Warrior is THE most difficult class to level = very gear dependant, slow leveling, need to eat after almost every single mob. Without buddies it could be very discouraging
---
&gt; I know I won't be using SnD until level 42 when I get rank 2
---
Why? That's silly.
---
Skinning + Herb/Mining is best for generating money.
---
On fresh server with lot of competition its maybe better to do just skinning.
---
Thank you :)
---
I do not really think Ion has any real control over anything of modern wow. All  design choices of BFA are to fuck the player and maximize profits. Not Gameplay.
---
unless you're doing AV and its 1.12
---
I mean raid wise everything got alot more complicated
---
I'm sure someone else could give more insight as to the "why". Only things I can think of are profession timed lockouts and just leveling multiple level 60s at the same time.
---
&gt; This video is unavailable
---
That does make sense. I'm guessing I still take Deep Wounds?
---
You should backstab whenever you have a dagger and 60 energy
---
Don't roll female orc if you hate clipping though. Her shoulders are seriously wack. Warlock T1 is the worst example. 50% of shoulders seem to clip through her boobs as well.
---
That's the spirit. Have fun man!!
---
Heraclitus considered fire as the most fundamental element. He believed fire gave rise to the other elements and thus to all things. He regarded the soul as being a mixture of fire and water, with fire being the noble part of the soul, and water the ignoble part. "A soul should therefore aim toward becoming more full of fire and less full of water"
---
Cause if I wanted to play Pokemon I'd go play Pokemon.
---
The great world tree!
---
Your right, but one thing I can point out.
---
If your good at goldmaking in retail, and I’m not even saying very good, you can make 3-5m gold a day.
---
You can buy (if the price is still roughly the same) 35+ WoW tokens for that, and level up essentially ten characters.
---
Or pay for WoW for multiple years.
---
In a single day.
---
My point, currently, buying retail tokens is actually a terrible idea that a lot of people fall into.  It’s made us goblins happy, since it’s crazy how much we benefit off it, but any player of the game can easily “make” a boost worth of gold in-game a lot quicker than they can working at a job unless they make 35$ a hour after taxes essentially.
---
And to be honest, I expect this to happen with Classic. Just not with “official” tokens for gold.
---
A lot of people just don’t care to take the amount of time (or invest any thinking) into learning how to make gold, meaning those that do get a even bigger monopoly. 
---
But hey, on the plus side people buying said things are having fun. (If not realizing they could have it way cheaper/faster)
---
gj Inarva and friends :)
---
Wait - I'm confused - did you watch the whole Q&amp;A from that clip or did you just watch the video linked by OP? Because the video linked by OP does not show anyone "owning up" to his mistake. He literally just says some of you like vanilla. Nor does he admit he was wrong.....
---
Well, if your comment was not crass gatekeeping, it sure sounded like it a lot.  
---
And if it was: I'm not alone here thinking that "the game starts at level 60".
---
Lol. Good luck to you and your guild the first day BWL, AQ40 or Naxx opens up. I'm sure you'll full clear each raid on day1 with your superior BFA skills!
---
Why is she wearing a cross?
---
Just shitty shamans with no WF totem, total off-brand Chinese crap.
---
Already planning mine out.
---
do yourself a favor and use snd
---
Please do make this char so I can corpse camp Ion.
---
Oh cool, i didn't realize it worked so musically
---
You can... But why? The run is a rite of passage especially at level 1.
---
I was thinking the same thing! This is really good!
---
Or once the server population declines after a month or two. I am fairly certain 60-70% of the day 1 players wont be playing a month later. I don't mean that the game will fail though, just a lot of people won't like how vanilla plays.
---
I remember tanking UBRS with Arcanite Reaper as Arms.  Wouldn’t want the healers to fall asleep.
---
Layering.
---
Get a working threat meter and make sure you stop dps when you creep too high/close to tank. Sucks because with a good amount of hit rating gear - you will peel off the average tank rather easily on a good crit.
---
Not sure why everyone seems to think he "owned up" to his mistake....there's nothing in this video that suggests that. Maybe he did do it ( I haven't seen those full videos that the clips are from) but this video does not indicate that he owned up to anything
---
&gt; Fury dual wield is awful for levelling.
---
[No.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14mYMRMlffxUlwscFjdHJ5Q16Le8-h4JDROkArWRQDoA/edit#gid=0)
---
Warriors are the primary tanks of Classic. They're pretty difficult to level, so if you intend to do so I would keep in mind that food is very important, first aid is a life saver, you want to learn a 2 handed skill as quickly as you can, and you want to group up with people for quests whenever you can.
---
It's difficult and it'll be frustrating, but hopefully you'll make a ton of friends along the way, find a guild that is happy to help you out with elite quests now and again, and once you hit 60 you'll be the most wanted demographic in the game.
---
Whatever you end up rolling, good luck and have fun.
---
[You can replace the in-game sound files with those of your choosing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pyz2UPkvCo)
---
I’d stick with darkshore/ashara just due to crowding. The human starting areas will be ultra camped for the first week at least and even with layering, it’ll be a shit show.
---
Should be fixed now, i forgot to change it from private to public.  
---
Thanks for the headsup

Rogues are a lot of fun, have good damage, and some good CC. Great for defending in WSG or AB, or peeling people off your carrier in WSG.

Can confirm this also.  Only time I ever got to run those &lt;59 was with a priest, where your hit chance doesn't matter so much.  And I also looked for that when filling groups.  Would have to be super desperate to take a 56 hunter for instance.  Ppl will probably be open to it if they have some ridiculously geared ppl to even it out.  No one likes to struggle in dungeons.

On pserver I had no option, and my only fear was of being annoyed for a while, which I was a few times (not too bad all things considered). I would only really want to engage in world PVP at 60, and I'd be willing to sacrifice that to not be bothered while leveling.
---
You know what else was really good? Your closing "heart will go on" thing at the end of classic beta. Keep up the good work dude!

This means more to me than you know.

I didn't see it. I wonder if it's on an older account and not the one I used for WoW/Diablo. That could be the issue. Okay, well, then I just need to wait to repurchase it. I know there are other options, but am not really interested in those currently.
---
Oh, you know what, it was probably from CD... Damn.
---
well my opinion is far from gospel and yeah I get your perspective. That's more how I feel about retail. I only care about endgame there. Classic for me is about the leveling experience because it is so much more immersive and feels like an actual journey instead of a straight path to end game like retail

They never really left, so its not a classic thing.
---
The face people will make when they used their vacation days to sit in queue
---
Or just wait for remaster edition coming in winter :D I'm really excited about, and hoping it will be good as our old W3 :)
---
retail has a shit ton of passive effects from azerite gear/trinkets/procs. I remember a blue post from legion AND one from bfa re-iterating that the lag during wpvp at world quests is caused from all the countless procs which players have. 
---
So not only did they fuck up with class homogenization on retail, they also fucked up large scale wpvp as its literally just a 2004 lag fest on 2019 servers. Now when Timmy presses ability A that stuns his opponent, slows him, applies a bleed, procs his 50 azerite passives, procs both of his trinkets, both weapon enchants, and a hundred other bullshit procs the developers decided to put it, it not only makes me sad to watch, but it also makes the server sad.
---
pantheon will be way more relevant by the time classic wow gets ruined by blizzard when they try to shovel in remakes of BC or whatever
---
People keep repeating that... Yes it was slightly more casual than some other games at the time... Who cares? That’s not at all the point. The discussion here is about how games tend to evolve to reach a broader audience over time, not caring about making the game good.
---
Keep slice and dice up. No reason not to. Rank 1 is 20% attack speed Rank 2 is 30%. 
---
Attack speed is good no matter the level you are.
---
Friendly reminder that Ion "Watcher" Hazzikostas is an anagram of Azeroth casino task "whiz" :)
---
Mostly beacause fights with mobs would end faster then the uptime of your SND, so you'd value CP and energy more by finishing mobs of with eviscerate. Which is mostly not the case during a dungeon boss or harder thrash mobs. SnD also becomes stronger in later levels due to stronger poisons etc. There are also more min maxing to using SnD like you are wasting CP and energy which could have killed mobs faster which in return saves HP = Time spent eating = Faster levling speed.
---
Well we could be friends but we would have about 300 ping between us
---
I figure I'd make friends and hide out in instances to grind to 60.
---
yeah man
---
I should have probably explained a bit better. When I said basically spam BS I didn't mean it literally.
---
I think the way it would actually work is that battle shout will be replacing revenge and sunder armor entirely. Not only does battle shout generate more threat but it's not dependant like revenge is. You can use it every global. And it's only 5 more rage which you're saving by not sundering anyway.
---
The dps warriors can be the ones to keep up sunder if the threat is high enough or the tank can just do it enough to refresh the debuff.
---
Rogue is the goto "I like pvp" class, I don't think you can go wrong with it. No real issues gearing pve wise either, they're just a touch slower at leveling than the average class.
---
I would just keep an eye out for quests that reward wands

---
I stupidly never realized how much of WoW came from WC3, even down to icons it uses and model style etc.
---
If you were a huge WC3 fan i can’t imagine how amazing WoW would have seemed to you when it came out.
---
There's literally gonna be tens of thoudands of people playing on your server. Don't be worried.
---
Good to know. When Google searching the results were definitely not definitive, but I didn't find anything recent talking about it.

I'd already heard about this but just feels like cheating to me, and not very immersive. The proper run I'll be doing.
---
Please tell me you're joking, that would literally be the last nail in the coffin for any further development on Classic WoW even in the far distant future

I second the WIM request, would be so hard to play without it now...

MyRolePlay is being updated for Classic; "almost ready" last time I heard.

Stalagg is at medium.
---
I was planning this too, but then I saw they are redoing the voice acting, probably with the WoW voice actors. The original voice actors made the game so good.

sure if your healers are healing your pet! great good for you. Good luck with that in a pug.

Put at least one point in improved Mend Pet to get rid of those annoying long term debuffs.
---
Oh, well, that actually makes sense I suppose.
---
But still... I'm offended and I don't know why HOLY FUCK IM A BOOMER.

It’s gonna be a clown circus either way. At this point the poor innocent boys on grob even gonna be mobbed with ques.
---
Exactly, I want help when I myself decide I need it. I don't want to level with training wheels lol

NA servers got way better names than EU what are you on about

---
He’s using the same 2 hours now. That’s just bad time management.
---
That's an interesting idea. Do you have values for threat generated by revenge/sunder/shield slam? You'd also have to take into account the fact that if you get 4 pets in the tank group you can't have a shaman giving the tank windfury.
---
I bought a new "Reforged" edition of this game like a year ago. I still haven't played it or heard any word on when it will be out.  That will be the last time that I ever do something that stupid.
---
I'm planning on playing an Undead Priest and I'm having trouble deciding on my professions. I wanted to take Skinning and something else to add some extra gold as I level so I don't have to grind as much or at all once I hit 40. However, I also think keeping an updated wand will be important. I've seen something about having an alt with enchanting/leatherworking so I can send some of the leather I get to that character and make my own stuff, is that reasonable? Maybe the AH will be flooded with cheap wands like the beta was and I should just buy them?
---
I was going to write something snarky about people telling you not to use snd but I will keep using snd and wave as I fly on past you.
---
Yea and I don’t think it came across that way I just think people should focus on what aspects of the game make them happy. If it’s relying for you then awesome, stick with that. 
---
I enjoy the leveling and I’ve done it so many times if I can find something to make it a little quicker then I’m all for it. I don’t want it played for me, but if it saves me from having to go back to wowhead or thottbot or whatever to look it up then I’m cool with that.
---
This is what I've been doing kinda! I never actually played WC3 before so I bought it in anticipation for classic. I also never got to play classic neither cause I started during the end of MoP/the beginning of WoD.
---
Interesting, I looked it up and turns out threat bonus on heroic strike is flat, I always assumed it was a percentage increase.  Faster weapon is better for threat then.
---
I have deduced why that sub is just a hatepool of toxicity and gloom!
---
All the people who are happy with a respective game are too busy playing it to post random shit on a generalized Genre subreddit about it. Majority of the mods play either FFXIV, BDO, or retail WoW, leaving all the people who want a non pay to win free to play action combat MMO to just complain on the sub.
---
I’m going Horde this go around and not going to miss Paladin seal cycling. 
---
Retail players coming to classic and expect a similar Paladin experience.. whew. They’re in for quite the awakening.
---
I wouldn't consider a guy who ordered the death of all male children under 2 to be based, in all honesty.
---
It was also fun to watch the back-and-forth between Blizzard and the theorycrafters.  Anyone else remember in late Wrath or thereabouts when Blizzard kept trying to push Frost as the dual-wield tree for DK's, and people kept figuring out ways to make it playable in Unholy?  It was a huge bummer to me when they finally closed the lid on that kind of flexibility.
---
It was also a huge bummer when they got sick of tweaking things and made all DK tanks go Blood, frankly.  I loved tanking as DW Frost.
---
Rogue is light years ahead of Warrior leveling.  Warriors don't get Stealth to bypass mobs, Evasion to avoid damage, 10 seconds of Stun CC, Gouge and Sap on every pull, Blind, or get out of jail free cards in Vanish and Sprint. Warriors only CC is an AoE fear that just brings more enemies to stomp you dead.
---
That's so sweet :D congrats you two. Playing classic wow with someone important is so much fun. Also the cookbook is a great idea, how didn't I think of it! Definitely gonna cook something from there for launch.
---
Basically better in everything.
---
Totally, this guy is a joke. I liked your sky is green thing, made me chuckle.
---
I don't find questing to be particularly fun to begin with.
---
It’s all against the TOS - account sharing - so just be advised.
---
We got discord now with LFG channels.
---
They probably have 5 more servers ready to open on release day. Theres no way they're leaving it as it is. I bet their strategy is fill up 1 server at a time then release 5ish more at release for players who subbed day 1
---
Well Herod players want the "genuine" classic experience. Not being ableto log on is a start
---
Keybind every combat ability and unbind s key.

---
The delusion is real at Blizzard. Looks like the current heroes of Blizzard that slowly ruined the game are going to be wrong again.
---
Mark my words, a tidal wave of people are coming that didn't want to pay for a name res. Vanilla wow was a great mmorpg, it's what the industry has needed for the past 15 years.

Dm entry farming is funfunfun. Also 48 is the cutoff to grey/no honor not 50
---
Yeah honestly i dont see the issue at all. People on this sub will hate ANYTHING outside of classic wow no changes blah blah blah. 
---
Retail has its benefits classic has its benefits.
---
i was gonna say the worst part about playing a rogue is that everyone else is too, and nobody wants to comp 2 rogues in a 5-man group if they can help it. most would rather have none actually
---
Lol I know that and I'm not planning on doing it, im just saying there are people out there that do leveling jobs for money legit.
---
The BC dungeon design was also so good that for the most part, you didn't mind that they were shorter.

There are people on both sides of the camp, It's ok and we all know it.

 I don't understand these daily posts constantly seeking reaffirmation.  
---
You do you and make sure to have a good time doing it!
---
And they are all wrong. You should absolutley be using a 1-2 cp snd. Small investment for huge gains.
---
The point of layering, is that blizzard expects people to quit the game by p2, and so they let the servers have 6-10k + players in layers, but by the time they remove layers in p2, they expect the server to be down to 3-4k players that a full classic server would have. The biggest flaw in this entire thing, is that the name reserve servers are probably not going to shrink as dramatically as blizzard expects, because everyone who reserves is someone who didnt care to waste 18 days of played time just to save their names,we are not exactly casuals.
---
This is why their mm system pushes people to 50% WR, and having 60%+ WR is considered extremely good, and usually only achieved by people in platoons who can skew the MM system.
---
classic should be a guy
---
Blizzard TOLD YOU that they opened a new server, they told people YESTERDAY to move.  
---
Thats a fact, but again, enjoy your circlejerk
---
But cc shares DR
---
They basically made the game much closer to what was supposed to release, it just took them a couple of years. I'll give them credit for sticking with it and turning it around, but they still released a shit game that they consistently lied about. There's still a sour taste for some people because of that.
---
My children. I am shocked not more people are saying this
---
This is really highly compressed. Anyone have an original Youtube link?
---
They are fully capable of delineating between characters and accounts... the population is based in accounts.
---
There was another blue post saying Herod, Faerlina, and Whitemane will have significant que times.
---
Understandable
---
i dont agree 
---
not even sure when the next big game release is out , some may leave for borderlands 3 or something like that
---
And brewfest! My og vanilla character still gets his brew of the month club in the mail.

I’ll look up some models and try to narrow it down. Man you are awesome for all the help. My nephew asked for help on buying him a pc so I have to lower my price on mine now to help him out. But I’ll definitely send you a model number on stuff if you don’t mind telling me how it will add up.
---
For me, ive always wanted to play a rogue named Shadow. When I first logged into the game during BC, I made a my rogue, named him shadow, name was taken. Every time ive logged in since, Ive always wished my rogue wasnt named what I named him and was named Shadow instead. Well now I have finally gotten my rogue named shadow that Ive wanted and Im not going to give that up because of a long queue. Give it a couple weeks, a month tops, and that queue will be very short of non-existent. Its worth the month of suck to get the name Ive wanted for years.
---
Thanks, helpful post
---
Same deal for me but the other way around.  Looking forward to the breath of fresh air.
---
Exactly
---
This is the definition of over focusing on winners.
---
It's like America is Connor Mccgregor, yeah we got overconfident and "lost" a boxing match to floyd mayweather, but considering Europe is the equivalence of a fat out of shape loser, and got absolutely wrecked by us in ww2, maybe they should shut the hell up.
---
sure, the one time you actually need them. otherwise an equally skilled warrior brings more dps, more consistent cleave, and the ability to offtank as needed
---
Ahh I misread, I just assumed it was exp.
---
Hell yeah bring it on
---
I miss hunters rolling on everything and running out of ammo halfway through a dungeon
---
yeah forget it, this reddit will just never understand Activision-Blizzard aint Blizzard
---
I actually think the queue time will be good. I can use that time to do all the stuff that I would otherwise procrastinate doing because I wanted to play wow. If I can't log in anyway I have no excuse
---
just theorethically,  
---
assuming same dps, isnt a 1hander + shield always better than a 2hander until warriors get overpower?
---
Being able to do your chores as you see fit and not having to rely on logging in every day to do them.
---
I don't know anything about current wow.
---
Thats not how that works at all. There will be queues on all servers at launch for sure. Layering is only to separate players once they are on the world servers, but not all players can transition from the login servers(where you have the character selection screen) to world(where the layering happens) at the same time, therefore the queues.
---
Honestly, that would be a very solid plan. Haven't heard that one yet!
---
the virgin alliance hipster vs the chad horde, one horde's garbage is another alli's feast.
---
Good luck cleaving when all mobs will be tagged by a million people instantly
---
Rogues are very good at objective based PvP too.
---
Of course you're going to have a bad time if you fight people in the middle of a retard zerg in WSG and accomplish nothing, but it isn't like they are getting anything done either.
---
Guarding your flag in WSG/assassinating an enemy flag carrier, stealthing up to solo the defender to ninja points in AB, and stealthing up to towers/GYs to take them in AV are what rogues excel at.
---
WeakAuras 2 is like PowerAuras on steroids.

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2

Depends, for ex. if you do not skill efficiency because of hybrid PvP Talents or w/e.
---
Yeah, but it also replaces a lot of other textures throughout the game. Chunks of flesh get replaced with loads of bread for instance.

Could you elaborate on what tribrid priest is please?

So you pay them to watch half the movie so you can watch the other half? Seems equally stupid to me.

---
30% retention isn't necessarily a bad thing. Blizzard claimed 70% of players dropped off very early back in the day.
---
On top of that, Classic WoW is essentially a F2P game for BFA players and F2P games have low retention.
---
No, it's the server. You find a shard with lots of world PvP and everyone on that shard lags.
---
depends on your time zone, it is midnight EU time (so 00.01 am on the 27th) but since i am in the UK it will be 11.01 pm on the 26th.
---
Unless you've worked 50+ hrs weeks while keeping a house tidy while raising kids, I dont care what you have to say on the subject.
---
Lots of people have free time in spades, which is cool, but lots of people don't. Instead of 2 hrs of wow, that's now soccer practice or doctor's appointments. You're just naive to the situation, which is ok.
---
Does this work in retail? I can't try Classic out right now so I tried your suggestion in retail and I didn't see any change take effect.
---
You can't have wizard oil and flame tongue on the same weapon
---
Coming into this blind... my advice is to be ready for the grind and don't try to rush it.
---
2 hours is 2 hours if you are going to do it regardless
---
It's not going to take them 2 weeks to make a 15 year old game run well. The second day it will be fine. There will probably be queues everywhere though.
---
2 full, 1 high right now. They'll be 5 digit queues in all 3.
---
I was 58 when chrome dinged. I’ll never forget those days.

---
Best part about heirlooms?
---
As a new (or returning) player, people will actively bitch and moan about you not having heirlooms.
---
I am an *amazing* tank, not to brag it's just an important preface.   
---
I MTed TBC, I have played every tank WoW had to offer (up to and including Cata) more days /total than I'd honestly like to admit.   
---
I excelled at speed-running and mass-pulls, because it gave me such an insane sense of accomplishment.   
---
It's an honest to god point of pride.
---
I tried BfA a while back when I resubbed for the chance to get into beta etc, and of course I dusted off my tanks. Warrior mainly (and a fresh Monk).
---
One dungeon run two people left because I wasn't in heirlooms, before we'd even begun. Another run a player bitched about my lack of heirlooms the entire run despite the dungeon going smoothly. Apparently I was not supposed to tank without heirlooms.  
---
Multiple times people have complained about the lack of heirlooms.   
---
I wiped a group *once* in those, what, 40 levels of dungeon crawling? It was the MoP boss where you are in a large room and 20 things are happening at once, I didn't have time to read the strategy, everything had to be fast paced or people would bitch and whine.   
---
*One fucking wipe*, without ever reading boss strats.
---
What was important was how it reflected what retail has become. 
---
It's reward addiction, which is not the kind of addiction Vanilla was. No, this is the "jonesing for another hit" kind.   
---
Vanilla was like weed, yeah you *want* it, because life is chill and cool when you're on it, but you don't *have* to have to like heroin.   
---
I ended up hating retail with a passion. Go figure.
---
Man durotar sucks and I'm rolling orc. :/ Can't wait for barrens tho!
---
It’s hard though for them though because people legitimately got enraged that at the Tortollan dailies bc they actually might take a full minute to complete.
---
Which, you can argue that the design of world quests and shit is faulty in and of itself but I still think the majority of the fault lies on lazy players. I hope Classic does really well and informs the design of retail more but I’m not convinced it will.
---
He has shoes on, can’t be horde
---
Do NOT scatter into freezing trap they share drs in classic. It's better practice to put up a wing clip before dropping a trap so it's far more difficult to dodge the trap. Also wing clipping into a scatter shot is a great way to get a melee off of you in a pinch. Frost trap with entrapment talented is also very underrated and is great for countering rogues who pop imp sprint and evasion, or if you have multiple opponents on you. Useful for mages trying to camp your deadzone as well.
---
Generally, you don't get a lot of out hardware improvements anyway. If anything, heavy netcode optimization is what matters.
---
The basic issue is that lag scales up exponentially with the number of players, so doubling your hardware won't mean double the players.
---
Weak, I do this manually
---
Yes it works in every version of wow. I think you must have done something wrong
---
The thing I miss most is the sense of community. Now in retail you can jump in a LFG with people you've never met and probably never see again. In classic, it was really nice to have that community and know who to run with and having a tight-knit group of people.
---
No l
---
Beta... Not live.  They said beta was different from the classic servers.
---
Anything that adds to something that isn't the MMORPG genre the game claims is something that is subtracting from the quality of that part of the game.
---
Store mounts? This detracts from the game because these mounts could have been put in the game behind an achievement to get people interested in playing the game more and set this goal for themselves.
---
Battle pets is a different genre of game shoehorned into WoW so that it pulls resources away from the base game without adding anything but some other random thing to do.
---
You read my mind, haha
---
I just checked this out, it's amazing!
---
It might beat the iconic power of even a carrot on a stick...
---
Thanks for the insightful comment
---
How would I get this bot on me server?
---
I don't get how you can jump away from a trap when, at low ping, it's an instant cast melee attack.
---
Unless your orc rogue resists their HoJ (30%), then it is a completely free honor kill. If the ret pally is dwarf it can sometimes be difficult, but I've never had any real problem fighting Ret.
---
Who's going to risk joining a new server launched on day 1 without being sure if it will fully populate with players? Everyone expects a huge drop off in players a couple of months after the launch of Classic - which is exactly why Blizzard has plans to remove layers in phase 2, so if I join one of these day 1 servers I may see myself playing on a dead, empty server a few months later when the more casual players are no longer playing.
---
Blizzard should be releasing new servers immediately instead of waiting until launch, otherwise everyone who has yet to subscribe until August 26 will fill up the current servers and make them incredibly crowded.
---
not 100% but dont the oils and enchantments clash.
---
You should be able to get 2 anyway, the enchant from the enchanting profession and a temp one
---
TBC in general was dope af, especially Illidan. Im sure questing was a lot more jank back then, but the overall theme was really cool.
---
Hence why I’m dropping retail.
---
I'm so excited for this as well!
---
It’s a Ret Paladin... Guy deserves the win if that’s the path he chose. Just give it to him.
---
Level to 60, do the "In Dreams" quest then spam dungeons (BRD for sure, U. Strat. with AD trinket for sure), and get attuned for the raids. That's as realistic as it gets. If you get BoE BiS World drops along the way, that's good but I wouldn't specifically target those.
---
Yeah but that’s like six people.
---
Listen man I’m hoping for the best. It’s going to be overloaded though. So, I would not be at ALL surprised if it took two weeks before it was smooth
---
Full of terrible editing and low resolution!
---
I played SWTOR at launch and i enjoyed the battledground with the ball (don't remember the name). It was super fun and the community there was great too, i ended up joining a premade that was owning our server and we ended up getting server first on the first raid boss with mostly pvp gear. Long story short that battleground is still my favourite of all time in any mmo and i've played them all.
---
Why would anybody use a guide for leveling xD
---
Well someone looks hurt. Don't take it personally bro
---
Everquest is what we all wanted but settled on WoW when eq2 wasn't right. I just had the time of my life on an eq emu all last winter. Im settling on this because of rl friends tbh.
---
Lol yes I’ll repost this again in a couple hours.
---
i dont even recognize retail wow
---
like ive been playing around with some stuff its crazy how different the zones are
---
and you dont even learn spells as you level 
---
i think its atrocious what they did to the mage tower and a bunch of zones
---
basically you spec a bit into every tree. 
---
This is the proper trispec: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGscZbhtZVMgz0t apparently requires decent gear to work.
---
Here's for proper raiding+pvp https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAVoof0tscZM some swaps possible.
---
I'm Heraclitus.
---
Welp
---
https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/
---
shit did trap and scatter share at 1.2? I played tbc for 6 month until now perhaps I got it confused
---
a lot of the things i like are kind of being fucked up by layering... So here's hoping it gets fixed.
---
Honestly - no. The reason i say this is because if you dont know where some quests/chains are - you will be stuck grinding boars in the woods for hours to make up that experience. Those boars are farmed by others who also didnt know about said quest/chain and it turns into a pvp war over who can kill the boars. 
---
TL/DR - Save the boars by using a guide.
---
just stop being Australian lol
---
This is the best ui for classic bar none. It literally has everything, bags, info panel, minimap, action bars, raid frames, player and party frames, enemy cast bars, buff and debuff cool downs and probably more. Download this, questie, and damage meters and you are good to go. It even has an option to automatically sense your screen resolution and set the position and size of everything. From what I could tell it did an amazing job with very little input or customization from me. I will 100% be using this at launch. Great work to the devs on this project.
---
https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com
---
You have totally missed his point and made up an entire argument that he didnt make
---
Basically lowbie areas you need to flag. Essentially everything after level 20 is full PvP. Unless you’re on a carebear server.
---
If I could possibly get my dream name (Gengar, on Everlook), I'd have zero questions about playing a Priest.
---
These are cracking me up thank you for this :D
---
Reckoning bomb dont work no more fam. It won't let you build up crits by sitting down
---
Exactly. Stalagg is the right call
---
*laughs in Grobbulus*
---
Here is how it looks for me. https://i.imgur.com/D2L04Tt.png
---
Lol, you think the average normal/heroic BFA raider is going to waltz in to AQ40 or Naxx and shit on the raid? You're in for a huge surprise my man.
---
My point was that *really* good players will clear AQ40 and Naxx the first day they come out. Good players, ei. semi-hardcore raiders interested in clearing all the content, are still going to have to progress through these raids. I'm coming from private server experience; most ppl spouting nonsense that these raids will be ridiculously easy for the average raider are just going off of echo-chamber nonsense "knowledge" gained through this forum.
---
I hate autocorrect, camped to hell I meant
---
I hate playing the FotM class, and I get the sense that a lot of people think Hunter in WoW Classic is some sort of easy mode.  :|
---
Apparently you can get 1-5 in ~40m just grinding wolves and bats. Not sure about after that though
---
One of my 3 reserved names is for my twink rogue...was twinks coming back ever in doubt?
---
Pretty sure it does. You have a source saying otherwise?
---
The guy getting kicked out the guild made me lose it hahahaha
---
They just added a server and it still has medium population. It's not Blizzard's fault that people don't want to spread out because they might lose their precious names.
---
m8 even a toaster should be able to play wow classic by now.
---
I had someone corpse camp me 2 houra once until a guildy killed them for me...
---
Yes, probably, depending on if you have the right pet with the abilities you need.
---
Plus you need to keep them happy and fed.
---
Thanks !! What's tour navigator ? I'll try to fix it
---
BOGGED
---
How do we know that will happen though?
---
Stop trying to make that a thing, Pierce!
---
I just beat it for the 1st time. Great story. The last level on the frozen throne was pretty hard since I haven’t played an RTS in 10+ years.
---
fukin lolz... zoom in on the robe
---
Thats what I mean, it seems like PvP servers get more "interaction", but if if its all just ganking no tanks
---
Yes, we are here with passion and hype. And making a character right now requires a sub. Who has a sub right now? Retail players. Will Retail players stay in classic? Most likely not. They will visit it for fun, and then go back to the "real" game, where they have a character at max lvl with progression
---
Also remember the looks! Iron jaw is bis.
---

Nobody has ever expressed this opinion on this sub before just now.  Wherever would we be with quality posts likes this one?
---
Found something that will offer you alternatives as well -  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow) 
---
This is mage specific so hopefully this helps more for your class :)
---
This is so true. I had really good gear as a rogue so I'd go nuts on the first few pulls and then go afk for ages and my total DPS (which is what we tracked) would still up end pretty high up. Nobody ever once said anything. I went and had dinner and all sorts sometimes. Just had to hope you didn't wipe.
---
i said 1-2 weeks.. yeah i think imma have to change that lol
---
For sure!  Like I said, a good bit of this stuff you can find in game either in the character panel or the spell book, but some of this info is annoyingly hidden :(
---
Lousy Smarch weather.
---
The more the better. Blizzards needs to wake up.
---
Is there a way to check balances on a server?
---
Maybe 15 years old?
---
Jupiter is a Roman God and the Romans wrote U's as V's. Go with Jvpiter.
---
i agree 
---
the game is designed around about 2.5k online players .
---
Streamer viewers are enough for like 20 servers 
---
heck asmongold has 39k viewers , thats enough for 15 servers when when phasing is turned off
---
(also good luck on that server)
---
I have seen and I'll repeat what I said in that post, with all the shit going on in the updated engine, that CPU is not good enough, I have a much better CPU in my laptop and the game is not playable.
---
(looking forward to people thinking hunters can melee in pvp)
---
I just miss the RPG aspect of the game. just feels more immersive when i have to buy throwing axes and train at major cities and buying a mount is actually an achievement . Game just feels more alive
---
Fair enough, that also makes sense.
---

Yeah it’s the constant push/pull of people annoyed they aren’t getting results fast enough and those that thing it’s too easy. 
---
Problem is two-gold though -
---
Daily quests are also “on rails”. In that you don’t get to decide what you do every day you are FORCED to do them, being forced to do something in an MMO means you want it done with as quickly as possible. 
---
The choice of doing something or not is valuable. 
---
That being said - stuff is too optimized nowadays. OG wow would be so much different if it was released today. Cookie cutter builds, optimal weapons, min/maxed questing, auction house manipulation, etc will make it very different unless you choose to exclude yourself from it.
---
It can just be annoying is all, I LOVE the idea of world pvp, its just that gankers ruin it for me
---
This is peak memery. Warrior tank battle shouting mobs into hitting him in the face. I like it.
---
Thank you for the reminder. I am aware of these gloves but forgot them somewhere alone the way. I'll make sure to add them if they would be a better fit for a BiS list. I'll check it out. Thanks again :)
---
if your tank is good you can corruption dot all targets (i like using immolate sometimes too), cor (if 2+ physical in party) or coe (if 2+ mages in party) and shadow bolt current main target. when theres a lot of caster trash like in scholomance i like to use cot+nuke on them and just tank myself or seduce+shadowbolt nuke. if your tank is inexperienced you just focus on the main target and leave the rest be. you will learn how to be efficient with experience dont worry about it.
---
Very nice!
---
Luckily I start in mulgore so a lot of time to configure my settings while running between quests!

---
On the other hand, Blizzard has gotten much better at banning bots.
---
They aren't nearly as safe or easy as they used to be.
---
I'm still struggling to pick the class I want to play. It's a toss between Hunter or Rogue. I am leaning towards Hunter due to being able to level quicker and being good at PVP. Plus the class fantasy is just great.
---
My friends and I decided just before the name reservation to go to a PVP server. For the longest time we were going to roll PVE. And I was gonna go hunter 100%. Now with a PVP server, ganking will be a huge thing, and I love ganking :).  I know hunters don't scale well with later tiers and that is kind of a downer for me, I always like finding upgrades for my character. At the same time, I doubt I'll ever get to Naxx, and I may run AQ40. 
---
Most of my time will most likely be spent farming gold, BG's and world PVP and the occasional MC run.
---
I'll probably be the same, getting kiled becuase someone stunlocks me sure sounds fun
---
Typical large patch stuff. Based on the past ones it's likely the first 24man raid, Extreme Trial, more story stuff, hopefully some Job tweaks (I really hope they touch up Summoner and Ninja at least), Blue Mage content and so on.  
---
Kinda hope we would get new Ultimate fight too.
---
exterminatus right away... adn for good meshure send the burning legion in  or the zerg or all of them.
---
&gt;  fury/arms are both turds.
---
Arms at 40 is completely fine.
---
It's because most big streamers rolled on Faerlina, Brazilians/Latin Americans unofficially rolled Thalnos due to lack of South American servers, which left Herod as the only logical choice to roll on for PvP EST players.
---
EU players who wanted to roll on USA servers also rolled EST because that was their best choice for ping. Middle Americans also rolled EST for ping because the EST servers are hosted in Chicago, which is closer than the PST servers. 
---
And then the final nail in the coffin is that there are just plain more EST players than PST.
---
Blizz waited way too long to release Stalagg too. 
---
It's a clusterfuck.
---
Dont forget all the threads on how toxic and memey it is! Love those!
---
You can thank him for helping make Classic happen, but the guy is an absolute pile of shit lol. Don't waste your time like that
---
Pop a 256gb SSD in that thing, only store your OS + games you're currently playing on it - it'll cut your boot times and loading screens drastically
---
It's a laptop cpu. What cpu is it? I doubt it's better, or it's just overheating and throttling.
---
He does some pretty cool Twitch streams on the game too.
---
Yea not talking about sitting down "fam"
---
Been using elvUI for a couple of expansions now. I dont even think I could go back to the regular UI at this point.
---
There was a Dwarf hunter on a pserver who was named 'Gordo' who dedicated himself to ganking horde in Hillsbrad. As soon as you entered Hillsbrad, the chat would be full of people mentioning Gordo.
---
I hope that there is another person like these on release because it really adds to the community the despite the salt mine that it actually is.
---
hey its me ur brother
---
I can't imagine it being fun if there is no one to yell " 50 DKP MINUS "   
---
but good job man!
---
People become suh assholes once they get behind a keyboard, how doe anyone gain happiness from ganking?
---
This has nothing to do with my comment. I was responding to OP thinking that a low pop server will be a good environment to play in, which it won't. 
---
WEther there will or will not be low pop server isn't important for the argument
---
Maybe he had 14 and this screenshot was a week or two later and he had ranked down.
---
Because they care about reddit posts?  And specifically reddit posts that will never reach the front of the sub?
---
Being able to play and level an alt character knowing full well that I'll probably never get them to 60 but not caring one bit because running around the barrens with your party completing quests and completing dungeons like RFK in order to try and get your hands on that sweet weapon upgrade like Corpsemaker is just as enjoyable and addicting than the end game at max.
---
As opposed the retail where you're not even playing the game until that characters maxed out and geared ready for raids.
---
At work, so I can't watch, but I definitely think modern wow was designed for the long-term casual player. They might be able to play once or twice a week. This allows them to farm a mythic/weekly conquest/dailies. Maybe do a raid if you have extra time. It almost plays like an app -- you log on, get a couple things done, get off. 
---
I've noticed that I can't have a long session on modern wow, it just gets boring too fast. 
---
So I agree that classic wow is absolutely long term engagement, and if you want, you could sit and play until you pass out.
---
Honestly being as totally delusional as you is what is truly pathetic.
---
You just don't understand the technical limitations of turning around a decision this late into a big company's scheduled release of a product.
---
If they made a change this big after all the testing and fine tuning they have done the release date would be pushed back MONTHS, all the hype would die down/turn to rage and Classic would more than likely be DoA.
---
You're retarded, you really must be some naive teenager to be this dumb.
---
Because if they fail I will laugh.
---
I’m making a 49 priest twink at some point.  The desire to have these leggings does loom.
---
I think you did some good content. I think the beginning message about server queues where probably better than the rest of your tips
---
Thank you. But That wasn't my question.   
---
The others answered:    
---
You can have 1 permanent enchant and 1 temp (oil or enhance).
---
Yesh
---
Makes sense. Basically all PST servers are the same bag but EST has already been split a lot. 
---
Just out of curiosity, why do some EU people prefer to roll US. People that want to play really late at night?
---
Should have been Rogue for stealth with that name
---
At the same time if I just want to enjoy WoW (I tarted in Warlords, so I never had much of a challenge) and a random rogue kills me over and over again for his fun would kinda ruin it for me a bit.
---
Or they can just turn off character creation on full servers like it was originally at launch, I VERY much doubt a large portion of the streamer playerbase will stay.
---
How do you know you play too much wow?
---
When your microwave dings and you say "grats"
---
Did you read what I wrote? Of course there will be queues. There will not be long queues.
---
Did somebody say Glider?
---
Won’t this be difficult to coordinate with the “severe” queues?
---
Well, the reality is there isn’t much theory-crafting because of the talent thresholds giving you key skills, as well as a lack of understanding of Mechanics back in the day. Certain builds are now known to be objectively better than others. 
---
I mean, Kripparrian didn’t even start his hunter YouTube channel until Wrath, right? And he was like “no one knows how to dps”. And he was right. Now modern dps rotations will be well documented, which makes talents much easier to max.
---
[Arms](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=warrior&amp;t=qfrqrryKyLqlryrzrArBqmslsxqisHsYp-rIrJrKqjqCsyszsAsBrDrZr0r1r2rL) is stronger until at least 40, but I would say you have to realize that fundamentally it is a 2 target spec. 
---
The one thing you lack is any viable single target rage dump when fighting normal mobs. You cannot sunder, you cannot rend 4 times, you cannot heroic strike. (well, you will have to sometimes at low levels until you get cleave, but you should try to avoid it). 
---
Your success will be dictated by how little extra damage you take in order for you to spend all your rage on 2+ target abilities like sweeping strikes and rend and so on. As a result, it goes from "competitive with fury" to "much better than fury" when you group with other people who don't clip your dots.
---
I feel that fighting humanoids is by miles better than fighting beasts. Mobs which run with dots on them are just free mitigation while still doing great dps, and if you are fighting 2 mobs, it's vastly easier not to clip your rend.
---
If you want some basic numbers:
---
If you never clip deep wounds, and factor in that it ignores armor, deep wounds is about 25% better than cruelty at 5% crit chance. 
---
But of course, you don't HAVE 5% effective crit chance, as hamstring can crit but does almost no damage, overpower has improved overpower, and you are almost certainly going to rush axe spec.
---
So in short, deep wounds starts better than cruelty and then gets a LOT better. 
---
In addition, if you have deep wounds, improved overpower is also a lot better than cruelty. about 1.9 times the damage, with the one huge caveat that you cannot overpower mobs which are affected by your charge stun (charge is a stun). But even with 1/3 of your attacks not being eligible for overpower, overpower is still like 125% of the value of cruelty. 
---
Really, if you look at arms vs fury in that light: that if you remove cruelty and deep wounds/overpower (as the arms package beats the fury package), it is not even close. Tactical mastery+ anger management is a lot less wasted points than booming voice. imp. battle shout is just not as good as 2h weapon spec. sweeping strikes is better than deathwish.
---
Meanwhile, I estimate you get about 16% uptime on enrage if you hamstring kite with a 3.5 speed weapon, and it never clips itself and you never stand around bandaging with enrage active. But 2h weapon spec is just "20% uptime equivalent just for showing up".  
---
There may be merit to that guy's slam spec if you just cannot figure out how to get value out of sweeping strikes solo and CANNOT find a leveling partner, but It's just very hard to compete with arms, as it just has better talents, until you can get flurry, at which point, I honestly haven't done the math.
---
But 1-40? Arms just beats fury badly if played well. It's just incredibly hard to compete with a tree with so little in the way of filler talents early on. (just deflection and tactical mastery really, and neither of those are completely useless.)
---
It was like that in vanilla so that's why it's in classic
---
the space bar + movement keys away from the hunter when his FD animation starts, theres plenty of time to move away and no time for the hunter to readjust his position. It's an extremely telegraphed moved, literally the only time a hunter ever approaches a person is to try and trap. Without scatter I literally have like 4-5 seconds to prepare my escape
---
Yeah. I just clearly remember tossing all of my old CDs to Goodwill. Diablo 1 and 2 as well. Lol.
---
Haha you right! I pined a comment saying that! Thanks for the feedback!
---
The context of my content comment was listing what the dude making these guides has so far rated.
---
First I've heard of that, but I've only been on this train since about Wednesday.  What happened?
---
Um it's part of their kit? If a hunter gets dead zone you think they're supposed to do nothing? Lol wingclip is awesome especially if improved.
---
Why wouldn't it be? The population reading is based on how many characters have been created. If people are intent on playing on launch day, they've made their characters already.
---
Warrior mage rogue are better if you care about number. 
---
Warlocks are needed for raids. 
---
1% doesn't matter
---
Because you said BC is "reliving the past" like vanilla isn't and drew the arbitrary line like any other option is unreasonable
---
Yes. Priests are just behind hunters, warlocks and mages in leveling speed imo
---
Every cleave group = 60 first week nolife?
---
Boondoggles
---
i think due to the number of content creators you dont even think about who will play at some point the publicity will double any numbers we can expect 
---
people like hobbs and sips and random content creators that have a following and played years ago will try the game 
---
like you say plenty will leave , the majority even will drop off but the 10% who stay will be in the millions 
---
its also a fairly entertaining game to watch and it can generate a lot of content bringing in people for months
---
its probally going to be the biggest game of the year once content creators start pumping it hard
---
In current wow I have seen at most 3 hunched orc males since the posture option was added
---

it's quite simple if there's a queue that big.  Go take a nap for a couple hours and come back your place in the queue will still be there.
---
Ok, this one i still laugh at myself over. 
---
About 6-7 months after it launched a buddy of mine finally convinced me to drop FF11 for WoW. I started with a Mage and was leveling in Trisfall Glades when i saw a warlock with an imp. I immediately geeked out thinking that i could get a pet to help me level. I ran up to him and /s asked him how do you get the pet. He said "You dont" and ran off. I took this as he was a dick not realizing he was a lock not a mage like me. I continue leveling and i see another lock with an imp. I again run up to him and ask how to get it. He tells me to delete my character and reroll. I again thought that this player was being a dick. I call my buddy that convinced me to play there and tell him the story - and he assumes i rolled a lock based on the question and scenario - and tells me that i need to go to my class trainer. I do and i dont see anything that looks like a pet spell. I actually read every.single.description. I called him back and now hes confused. He asked me to read him what spells it says available for my level that i might not be able to buy yet. I tell him the first spell on the list and he busts up laughing so hard that he hung up with me. I am now getting pissed off and thinking this is a giant troll on me. He calls me back about 10 minutes later when he regained his composure and tells me "You need to be a warlock to have a demon pet, you rolled a mage"  
---
I still laugh at this with him when i talk to him. 
---
Next was about 2 months into playing. I was going OOM way too fast in dungeons and i never had a chance to sit to drink because the group didnt want to wait for hte mage to drink every other pull (cant blame them) so i decide "i am going to get a good sword to pad dps while i am OOM" (not realizing a wand is WAY better) and i purchased a level 30 something blue sword off ah for like 6g. I was proud of my sword and frequently ran up to melee range and would swing away. Someone noticed and asked me what i was doing and i replied "Im oom so i am getting dmg in" - he inspected me and linked my sword and laughed saying something to the effect of "thats a sword for warriors, you dont ever want str on gear." being a noob i responded with "Well i am still doing more dmg than you" (which i wasnt running addons so who knows how true that was lol) - about a month later i started researching and realized i was a total idiot.
---
it was like that in 1.12, and only 1.12, and maybe not even all of 1.12.
---
Thanks to who?! Thanks to WHO?!! 
---
Chromie ain’t done shit congrats to us all!
---
I would expect that to be the case.  Just looking at this run, he barely has any addons, I'm assuming because they had not been created yet. Just in terms of addons alone, there are some that will save you hours off a full 60 run.
---
Your analysis is missing one other thing: Competition.
---
Why was street fighter 2 so popular in the 90s, compared to later fighting games? Because it did not have as good competition. The sorts of experiences you could get from action games were lacking in a lot of ways- so people who wouldnt play fighting games now were playing Street Fighter 2 instead of whichever genre of action games they'd prefer to play today.
---
Similarly, vanilla wow was competing with the RPG experiences that were available, with their strengths and missing things, in 2004-2005. Modern WoW competes with games that have had many more years of development, allowing for features and experiences that were simply impossible in 2004-2005. 
---
Subscription numbers have to be viewed in light of the competition. An RPG fan in 2004/2005 couldnt choose to play the Witcher series over WoW. Sure, they had other good RPGs to choose from, such as Baldur's Gate and KOTOR, but it still wasnt the same environment as "What RPG do you want to play in 2019?"
---
It's a valid complaint considering that was the whole point of subbing early in the first place lol.
---
Maybe you can work on your real life situation so you can get the power and control you so desperately crave?
---
The way to get people into different cities would be to add new and relevant content there, or that somehow involves going there. BFA should have had more events like sieges on the various cities where you play attack or defense depending on faction, earn titles, resources, gold, loot, etc. Imagine the Horde being able to plunder Ironforge. The Battle for Lordaeron scenario was a weak, thin take on this. They could have done better. Maybe next expansion could involve defending various cities against the Black Empire or whatever. Meanwhile I'll probably be playing Classic.
---
Don't forget a threat meter.
---
Illustreous pearls.
---
Thanks for this, I can keep tabs this way!
---
Blizzard also announced that a medium pop nowadays I larger than full in classic so it's not bad at all.
---
*cackles in Bloodsail Buccaneers*
---
Easy to do if they only played when they had rested XP.
---
And?
---
Nope. It's ok for phase 1 when everyone has shit gear, but as soon as people start filling out prebis and getting some epics you'll fall off very fast - and that's on fights where you somehow can keep your pet alive. Your pet gets zero scaling from stats in Classic, even as BM. Your pet will more or less be the same the second you hit 60 in greens compared to when you're in complete level 90 epics from Naxx.
---
Invisabull
---
Not necessarily because of the aforementioned hamstring kiting. It could be possible to take less damage by moving in and out of melee range compared to the extra armor and block of a shield. Of course, you get Overpower at level 12 (also no Hamstring until level 8 too) so we're talking extreme early game here with limited weapon options. During those early levels you just use whatever you find with the highest dps.
---
Usually that's still a 2h weapon, but Tauren in particular will almost assuredly use a 1h+shield for a short part of that because the final quest in Red Cloud Mesa (first quest hub) offers 2h weapons that a Tauren cannot use by default (2h Axe and Staff). It costs 10s to train either of them and requires travel to inconvenient trainers to even do that. Instead I took the 1h weapon and used it until I could afford to buy a 2h Hammer from the weapons vendor in Bloodhoof Village (2nd quest hub), which is cheaper than 10s and higher dps than that quest reward anyway.
---
If you find a green BOE weapon you might be able to replace that vendor bought weapon, but I think I used it until getting Goblin Smasher towards the end of Mulgore (though you could theoretically get it as early as level 5 with help I think).
---
I agree we need more posts like this one! /s
---
You are with a boost
---
Or at the start of every expansion after hitting max
---
yikes
---
I'd argue that to do it "undergeared" that you need 40 people all on the same page and mechanically skilled.
---
Huttball was also my favorite PvP mode.
---
How do you the original once you've bought Reforged? I prepurchased months ago, but I don't see where I can download or play original WC3.
---
Those first 9 levels are a drag though.
---
With only slightly better CPU/GPU, I was running 200 fps during the stress test, everything maxed out. Pretty sure you'll be fine.
---
All those games listed there are way more resource intensive than Classic, too.
---
I play max settings on a Ryzen 2200G intergrated GPU
---
I use this when people beat me in duels. Very helpful.
---
Don’t speak of the darkness that is retail wow in this sub
---
Take it boy!
---
Do female orcs exist? I thought there was big hunch back orc and skinnier straight back orc with moobs
---
You could probably have a tab open in retail while you're in queue for classic. I could be wrong though.
---
They are green to you, they won't attack you but you can't heal them or buff them.  Same with friendly npcs in hillsbrad etc.
---
Oh, gotcha.
---
Once you hit mid 40s it gets a bit... sluggish. You just feel less powerful than you did in earlier levels and it’s harder/slower to solo stuff. Up until then it’s great though, and if you have friends to level with it doesn’t matter at all!
---
You do realize with current sharding &amp; phasing technology you will almost NEVER see more than a handful of players regardless of what server or population you have.. Try even completing a quest in classic wow with 30 other people in the area(you won't be able to.)
---

You're welcome :) I'm playing Gehennas Horde. Alliance seems more of a PVE faction to me, I would join Pyrewood Village for Alliance PVE or Horde on Mirage Raceway, Mirage is the most balanced

"really powerful" is wrong combination of words here. These are really outdated low-end specs.

A long, long, time ago... My buddies and I were playing alliance and role playing as The Children of the Light. One day we got a little bored of leveling; naturally our only other option was to go put down some Darkfriends. We were only level 30ish but we decided to go to the source of evil and raid the Crossroads (I say raid but there was only about 5 of us).
---
After an eternity of running from the Eastern Kingdoms we were finally on a hill over looking the Barrens. We saw some filthy Orc doing a spot of hunting, not realizing that he was the hunted. We grabbed a few scalps as we pressed onwards, until at long last we were 500 ft. from the Crossroad gates.
---
With a prayer to the creator on our lips we bid each other farewell and charged.
---
We had enough of a surprise to make it past the guards and right into the heart of town, where we Disemboweled a pair of duelists. YELLING in the common tongue we let the horde know heavens wrath had come! 
---
Then 5 arrows dropped the noble lad to my left — a mass of green skins surged forward, the guards in tow — everything turned to anarchy. We knew this was our moment of doom... When suddenly a figure riding a ram appeared, like if Jesus Christ himself took Dwarven form. He was level 60 and wasn’t in our party, lord knows what he was doing there, but there was no time for questions. He leapt from his ram and immediately cut down the Orc charging me. Three swings later a troll was dead at my feet.
---
“For the love of god RUN!” I shouted to the remaining party. And we did, hastening for the exit. We didn’t all make it... the creator obviously blessed me with his divine protection as I bubbled and ran past the walls, I turned to see my stealthed rogue friend was the only other survivor. He wasn’t all I saw, the unmistakable sight of a Tauren riding a kodo came barreling down the road from town, we knew we couldn’t run so we turned to fight and die. He came at us cocksure, I used the last of my holy power to heal us, the rogue stunned, but we were only delaying the inevitable...
---
Then a miracle. The Tauren fell over dead at the climax of battle. A Dwarven axe planted in his spine. The 60 warrior had caught up to us, we hadn’t seen him in our frenzy. He nodded to us without saying a word, mounted his ram and rode off into the barrens. We saluted him and quickly made our exit, escaping the Barrens with our lives, a scrap of glory, and an unforgettable memory.
---
Yeah just that one time where you can’t clear an entire raid tier without bringing 3-4 rogues. Just that one.
---
Only to have the entrances staked out by opposing faction lol
---
I think they used to let it occur at launch but patched it out specifically to stop the exploit you see in the video where the dude can fuck with unflagged horde.
---
Blizz generally frowns upon ways to grief unflagged lowbies in their safe zones.
---
Warlock pets aren't little mini powerhouses that go around killing stuff and you support (which is basically what a levelling BM hunter is). They are used for a specific utility, but they aren't strong in their own right. VW can only tank, it does pathetic dps, imp shoots firebolts but dies as soon as something looks at it. Succ is just for seduce and puppy is just for devour and CS.

An SSD is probably the biggest price/performance upgrade you can pop into a PC, and it looks like they've halved in price since I bought mine lol.
---
Enjoy!
---
Bigger SSD's prices grow fast but smaller ones should be passable. I think something around 128GB should be like 30? if even that.  
---
The load times are really fast compared to HDD so if you can fit one in go for it.
---
&gt; in my eyes
---
And that's great. But objectively, they damage the core systems that an MMO needs. So objectively, they arent improvements, not for an MMO.
---
Link?

In general, if an item is of green quality and is bind on equip, its useful for another player = put it on the auction house. Even if it has bad stats, it holds value as it may be disenchanted. Pick up skinning + herbalism or mining for easy gold. A lack of gold can really hold a player back. I don't agree with "never buy anything from the auction house", since some of my most fond memories as a newcomer in wow was picking up a sweet new weapon or piece of armor. Just holding onto it until max lvl may be the best choice in the (very) long run, but come on - why skip the fun parts on the way there?
---
Where do you find good measurements of monthly active users for wow? Can they really distinguish between users and characters, since many people have multiple characters?
---
Warlocks are wanted in raids man lol
---
Also the entire barrens is horde controlled because Blizzard wanted to take it easy on them and let them get to all the dungeons easily since they're so precious.
---
The ui itself isn't ground breaking. It will still allow you to experience all of the vanilla game play. Vanilla wasn't about not seeing debuff timers or not seeing enemy cast bars, or a clunky interface. It was about the difficulty of leveling and the community aspect. Neither of those will be ruined with elv. If you want to cut out questie that's cool but using the base ui is just forcefully limiting your effectiveness out of pride. Either way you decide, enjoy the experience. Just my two cents.
---
Im not going on herod. Im gonna wait and see what realms are even and not hugely over populated
---
No no, i am not talking about reckoning bomb. The advantages of the a geared retri paladin vs some other classes are huge in pvp. Self healing, freedom, dispell magic, magic damage, increased movement speed, a stun and a CC. Enough to beat 50% of the classes and have a good change against others.
---
Theyr armor and health are higher, and they have more abilities. It's not an easy grind spot, but it has good loot.
---
You know I actually befriended one of them and added them on facebook, turns out it was this hotty Chinese girl and now we're....she wanted nothing to do with me.
---
1 WoW license can only be logged into 1 WoW game at a time. If you want to play retail at the same time you'll need to do it on another license.
---
Come in here and tell me I'm wrong on launch, but I won't be. There's no way they would have a game this hyped up be unplayable for 2 weeks, their IT staff would be fired. 
---
And it's not like it's hard for them to spin up more servers either, I think blizz uses AWS now, so they can spin up as many VMs as they need.
---
Day 2 you will be fine. You might be stuck in a queue but once you're in it will be fine. And if every server has a queue you can bet they will open new ones, jump to one of those and play.
---
That was working for me.  I was having a few issues where the bar numbers were different from BFA and classic, but swapping the locations fixed that.
---
Battle shout spam with heroic strike is the highest Single Target TPS with 4 pets in the warrior group.... by far Keep in mind it is unavoidable, unlike revenge/sunder.
---
This also means that thunderfury should be a DPS priority and rogue should use Expose armor.
---
Warlocks bring tons of utility.
---
Soulstone. Health stone. Summons. Blood pact. 
---
Play what you want! You'll get invited if you're good at your class no matter what
---
the dwarves in the barrens are the same.
---
There used to be an exception which was the dwarves in mulgore which were actually flagged as alliance npcs (had the alliance logo on their portraits and would flag mulgore cows for pvp when fighting them.
---
However I think again this was nerfed sometime before 1.12 so isn't like this in classic.
---
Only thing that will push most modern PCs in classic is 40man raiding due to a lot of actions. But even then its just FPS drops that are usually manageable.
---
Sounds like you don’t even need to take loot to get a block. Did the downvotes hurt you that bad?

I think you do, but you don't

im on east coast so should be 6pm for me?

Lol you sound like more of a fan than me

although i agree with you, I’m still practicing an optimal run to 1-30 at least so i can get out of starter zone quick so i don’t have to deal with the starters . having to compete for quest items/mobs is rough so hopefully I can get past that annoyance real quick

---
Blood Fury has a Global cooldown, thats why it does not work...
---
Prolly some ranged class so you dont waste time running.
---
Actually it is, because they shouldve had to foresight to add more servers ahead of time. It's obvious to everybody but blizzard just how much demand there is going to get for classic come the 27th, and that the current amount of servers isn't nearly enough (even with the addition of stay).
---
This. It's a complete non issue. As long as you don't just mindlessly vendor all the meat you come across you'll have 0 probs without cooking or even buying meat.
---
That's when you kill him back or find someone else to kill haha. It's up to you, that's why there is both. But there is also a reason pvp servers are much more popular than pve.
---
It's hit and miss, it does make things more interesting for sure, but it can be very annoying when you just want to chill out.
---
Rpg elements like ammo, skills, reagents, ratings, resistance, etc
---
I remember my first character was on a shared account with my cousin. I leveled a frickin Paladin to 60 with my CS clan and was gearing up to start MC. Then my cousin started playing more after his school let out for the summer, so I had to get my own account and level a fresh toon to 60. So I felt the pressure to quickly get there. So I used Glider to bot a mage to 60 in about a week. It ran 24/7 and I'm sorry, but not sorry. That slog with the Paladin was rough and I have not gone back to Ungoro Crater since.
---
Lots of people are waiting to sub on release day to not lose gametime because reserving names are not the most importaint thing. My bet is that if blizz adds another realm it will be full on launch
---
Cool set up. Confused by “my wife’s boyfriend”.
---
Your wife’s boyfriend?
---
Ur wifes boyfriend wait what lmao
---
Good thing you found a boyfriend for your wife. No interruptions.
---
The classes who are unable to heal you mean.
---
Ret Paladins definitely have their place in BGs, but no class has to actually fear them. You're never alone for long enough for a Paladin to kill you.
---
Where am I suppose to look? Kenco research on threat never specified different threat values based on spell school type.
---
Unless you have sources that I don’t. I’d very interested where you found this information.
---
Oh damn, I figured it must have been hard coded as 60, not just 'capped'. That's great news!

Pvp doesn’t even come out till like phase 3 or 4

They link it there.  I think the goal is blizzard does not want you streaming or providing remote access to your game/account as it would be an easy way to mask that you were paying some Chinese farmer to play your account for you while you’re at work or whatever.
---
Let’s see them tax returns first then I will consider. Let me know.

Agreed. The character models look like they belong is some cheap moba phone game or something. I think I'm thinking of Arena of Valor.

I'm going to play some wc3 tonight and break out that Keeper of the Grove to scratch the druid itch :)
---
Not remotely compared to many others on the game.
---
Rob Pardo, Jeff Kaplan, Alex Afriasabi, Tom Chilton, Kevin Jordan are all far more critical in the creation of the original game, they just are not stupid enough to talk like they invented the game themselves.
---
I mean Mark Kern is a lunatic who claims he invented the ! for quest markers over NPCs, a feature that existed in WC3, a game he didnt work on.
---
I'm 16 an hyped to play this game.  You just gave me the sudden realization that I AM part of the next generation to be "sucked" into this game.  That's scary, but I'm even more excited now fsr.

I shall roam Moonglade as a kitty and /purr all the horde!
---
its 2019, you dont have a open relationship? bigot..
---
That largely depends on what you plan on doing. Mage is probably the easiest class in PVE considering you just spam 1 ability for the first 2 raids (and maybe use Arcane Power). Warrior is also very simple dps with 2 CD based abilities, execute, and a rage dump (HS/Cleave).
---
In general if you can handle retail wow rotations then almost every classic wow class is going to be simple.
---
He is a pedo for sure man
---
there is about a 99% chance that at least one child of the people from the server i played on will be playing on my server lol.
---
heck i knew a mum who played and her kids during vanilla , i could end up in a raid with her grandkids.
---
ill probally pretend im at least 5 years younger than i am lol
---
in more than one sense
---
It doesn't look like you will be able to transfer from normal realm to pvp one, only the other way.
---
Whats cool about vanilla, with the mass amount of gear swaps, engineering gadgets, plethora of abilities, and consumables, each class you play will have so many more options than your working memory can technically take care of, meaning you won't really be hitting any skill cap no matter what class you play.
---
A better question is which classes might have a higher floor (i.e. even if you are playing bad it is still technically pretty decent). In PVE, the single target spam classes (frost bolt, shadow bolt) will be a bit easier, whereas the more complicated rotations (2-handed slam warrior, aimed-shot + trinket swapping hunter, wolfhead helm feral) will be a bit harder, and maybe rogue would be somewhere in the middle.
---
In PVP, all the classes will be a bit harder to play because you need to be very quick and understand many things that are going on. Obviously if you are gonna AFK spam ranged abilities in AV, the ranged classes would be easier, but in the other BG's they will all have a very high ceiling.
---
I'm in a guild with 40 people ready to go, but we aren't going to sub till the day off, why waste money on gametime we're not going to use?

Could you please play more ty
---
Absolutely second this. An SSD is a massive noticeable improvement to load times and easily the largest single item you can get for a pc. Games like MMOs have considerably more load times than others, and will give a large performance boost to the user.
---
If you're going herbalism, I'd suggest a Tauren. They start with 15 bonus points which means they can pick Earthroot right from the get go.
---
It doesn't sound that impressive, but honestly there's nothing more depressing than staring at the 7 Earthroot on your minimap and having to leave because you need to go pick 15 peacebloom first.
---
No way that guy still sets foot in MC with the full T2 set.
---
Really? Well disregard then?
---
Out of curiosity, reference? Seems like something I should read.
---
Is it too late to learn guitar in 8 days?
---
Nope, I’m gonna have a epic lvl 60 mount the sec I hit 60
---
Thought arms was best especially with sitting not proccing stuff. Also arms makes you win more 1v1 pvps once you get mortal strike and hamstring root.
---
It was so even at the very first stress test to level 5 where we got like 50 silver rewards from quests. It will be the same at level 60 but the reward will most likely vary depending on quest level - if you do level 10 quests you will get 10s for instance. At level 60 you will get a couple of gold I guess but still not that much to be worth grinding all the quests.
---
You can't really compare their relationship with the EU to the one UK will have after brexit.

Guys remember when we said we'd rather have huge-ass queues and a clusterfuck at starting zones??????
---
WELL BEND OVER 'CUSE HERE IT COMES!
---
^(Jokes aside, I don't see more than 100 people getting past level 5 at launch night)
---
Yeah that actually looks pretty dope.
---
I don’t see a problem with that. The people can reroll at any time. If they choose to play on a crowded server and not reroll while sitting in queue all day, they want to wait in queue all day. That’s their choice.
---
I can't wait
---
As I understand it you can have either:
---
Enchant + oil
---
or
---
Enchant + shaman wep imbue
---
Sure mate! I'll be rolling a human paladin, and you?
---
Paladin is probably the easiest. Easiest DPS (just trash as it) arguably an easy tank (actually very hard because they suck at it) and imo the easiest healer in pve and pvp. Slow but simple leveling.
---
Warriors are also pretty easy at dps as long as you can press abilities, but hard to level and you get forced to tank a lot which is very difficult. 
---
Druid is daunting and has a high skill cap but is pretty easy and will let you get a feel for the game. The worst class endgame but also by far the most flexible. Although shapeshifting and all their abilities may seem difficult, the groupings and exclusivity of the usable abilities makes mechanical things like binding several abilities easy, and gives you a very clear gameplan every time you’re in a different form; heal or spellcast as a regular Druid, dps in catform, tank in bear form, run in travel form. 
---
TLDR id recommend a Druid overall but paladin can be good as well.
---
Dog. Human is better. But at the end of the day. If you’re committed to dwarf. That’s better than any racial.
---
Yes, during the last stress test I just used the latest 8.2 version and just told it to load it anyway. Worked no problem.
---
Beautiful

Modern server architecture allows them to spin up more auth/login servers based on an auto scaling profile if they're hosted in something like AWS/Azure. The blue post already says this:

I’ll take like 6 month to get level 60. I don’t care about a 1 DPS increase for 500 gold

I keep trying a rotation of about 50 names on Pagle with no luck so far but I will try a few times a day until launch.
---
Fun fact about the grammar here. The reason why its so awful is not because the scammer is stupid, but because they need to filter out those who respond to their scam. They need to increase their chances to get only really dumb potential customers to contact them. Every scam attempt needs some of the scammers time (responding, bargaining etc) and thats becomes a problem if they are doing it on the large scale. Also every click on the add charges them so they only want dummies to click.
---
Same goes for the "Nigerian prince" type of scams btw.
---
By clipping, I mean kill the mobs or reapply the ability before it finishes. 
---
No, the solo strategy is to bank up rage hamstring kiting single mobs until you are unable to do so as you will cap on rage, and then either open on a single mob and pull it into a second while  it's still at like half health so you can dump rage on cleave and an extra rend (prior to 30), or you bank up almost full rage, then charge into 2 mobs, pop sweeping strikes, and blow all your rage at once so you don't take way too much damage.
---
Obviously, it's VASTLY easier to do when you just have another warrior and you can both stand next to each other and each tank 1 mob while damaging both of them. Then you almost always have 2 mobs to spend twice as much rage on rend and cleave whenever you need to dump rage.
---
I don't like hamstringing 2 mobs and cleaving solo as it can be very tricky to actually make sure the cleave hits both mobs, when you are only briefly ducking into melee range when your autoattack is up. You can do it, by targeting the farther away mob and then activating cleave and moving in, but if you mess it up, you lose a HUGE amount of damage. Also, hamstring is by no means free, and maintaining hamstring on 2 mobs makes it a lot more likely you won't even have the rage to cleave. 
---
Generally, you want to cleave while stationary, I feel, unless you are doing it very well and almost never cleaving a single target.
---
To be clear, this is completely different from 5 man dungeon leveling. I did a spreasheet a while ago, and to my surprise, realized that against full health elite mobs that will take mostly physical damage, cleave is actually worse than sunder armor. This is JUST what to do in open world leveling against normal mobs.
---
Fair nuff.
---
Yea its not like we got then to add rp-pvp servers by complaining
---
As soon as Phase 2 drops the DM entrance is going to be littered with the corpses of PvErs being camped by honor farming guilds. I guarantee it.
---
I dont think so, I'm 20 and this is way more exciting than anything I've done lately.
---
I haven't found anything supporting it but the most common thing I've found (and why I chose not to play Tauren Hunter) is that they do not get extended range, but do get an extended dead zone to compensate for their greater reach, which means they have a smaller window within which to attack.
---
You'll then just move this time next week when Thalnos is full and they open up another server.
---
Try both.   
---
Years ago, during Vanilla and early BC, I mained a rogue but wanted an alt to hide on for when I didn't feel like being invited to raids or instances. I made a druid and quite liked it, but a few days later also made a shaman. The shaman ended up becoming my main.

Really, you won't know until you experience them for yourself. All of us have our favourites, but one person's fave might not be yours.

Diablo III is different enough than Path of Exile and certainly easier to pick up and drop than Path of Exile is. I personally enjoy PoE for the unique economy and sheer amount of potential builds you can make.

Thanks that’s really cool how they put in a fun connection.
---
Ahh yes, i also dont know how math works....
---
Generally subtlety is the go to pvp spec but it can depend on the type of pvp you are doing. Subtlety is certainly the strongest in solo pvp with prep to give you double cd's and has almost no gear requirement (see World of Roguecraft video if you'd like). In more large scale pvp you could see better results with Combat. All rogue specs do things well in classic though. It's one of the most fleshed out classes in the game.
---
I got the lvl 40 epic dagger in tanaris on my mage in tbc. Equipped it lol.

Would look even better on a female human with a ponytail.

Because a lot of players aren’t subbing to the game 2 weeks early to reserve a name and 80% of servers are already listed as high or full. They should not wait to be overwhelmed. Releasing new servers proactively is the best decision.

Nope it’s more fun for me to level with a guide. I like always having clear objectives to complete. Plus the pathing makes you feel like your really maximizing your effort. I’ve leveled to 60 back in vanilla without a guide when I was younger and I feel like I had the adventure experience already. I’m ready to use my time off for maximum level grinding lol

I have characters on Herod and Stalagg. If they release another east coast pvp I’ll make one there too. Then I’ll just pick the one I get into on launch day.

Either way herod is gonna be hour long ques for months so have fun with that
---
I'm interested in Hunter for soloing, kiting, and generally pulling off things that other classes can't. Should I level as BM? What kind of tricks can I pull with what kind of pets? What else should I know?
---
For reference I'm a vanilla &amp; TBC vet from pservers and retail but never really knew anything about hunters beyond mindlessness in TBC and solo dungeon videos in vanilla.

I am jealous of you. I wish I could wipe the world out of my mind. You will literally be amazed by the sheer scale and differences in the world. Prepare for an amazing experience! Even more fun with a SO! Don't fight over loot and have fun!

If everybody thinks like this,which many people do their will never be a balance.
---
I think that's that was the whole point of the post, to poke fun of married wow players.
---
That may just be because of you not liking legion. I remember the DK order hall quest lines, Warlock, and mage, the paladin Corrupted Ashbringer questline . I also remember “NOOO oDiN I TOO HAVE PROVEN MY WORTH!” And in Dk quests, Nazgrim getting a choking fetish, cooking with Odin, Huggin and Munnin, Being teleported left and right during the night born questlines. Guldan winning the first attack on broken shores and killing Varian, and a bunch of other stuff.
---
Very much this. Can't wait to rebuild this type of community again!!
---
What mess are you talking about dude? The server release is going ad planned already.
---
Might be somewhat easy, but not TBC easy. IIRC there was a patch in TBC that buffed beast mastery and made it the top DPS spec for hunters for quite some time. You basically needed to do some rotation with steady shot weaving. With the right speed bow you could actually bind the steady shot to your mouse wheel and just click stuff as it came off of cool down. I was a pretty hardcore raider at the time and it was a lot more fun and relaxing to just focus on moving around and not have to look at buttons all the time.
---
Being able to solo elite mobs with kiting is a lot of fun too
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but isnt it only for quests that give exp? Do grey quests give any exp?

Thanks for the reply ! I usually like the aesthetics of priests and I like some complex gameplay, I've heard that priest have just that, as opposed to paladin for instance. What hord race though ? I'm set on dwarf if alliance but I'm having a hard time deciding between troll and undead for the horde. Also Would it be a problem if I pick a different race than her or is it easy to join each other ?

Engineering is great, especially for PvP but for me personally I love to be self-sufficient. I prefer to have a gathering profession that feeds my crafting profession, this way I can avoid spending any hard earned gold on the Auction House and have a better chance to make some. Transmutes are definitely important especially for those damn Arcanite Bars. People will **always** have a need for flasks and potions.

Dont you put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby!

I logged in today, just to see what was all about the name lineup.  Almost all the servers are already full, it's ridiculous.    I'm sure there will be a drop off once newbies realize the difference between grinding 12 years ago versus grinding now, but still.
---
Sense of accomplishment, feeling of awesomeness just from random world drops. Attempting to ignore heirlooms in current WoW just feels like you're massively handicapping yourself for no reason, while also making the leveling process worthless.
---
1. Is flask making / alchemy something you keep around indefinitely or do you swap out the profession?
---
Yes. In fact if you obtain the more rare recipes this is potentially the most profitable profession.
---
1. What secondary profession do you run? I read you normally go herbalism but I hear engineering is too good to pass up?
---
Engineering is only a most have if you plan to do a lot of pvp. Otherwise just stick with herbalism... unless its phase 2-3 and you have a farm alt.
---
1. What professions do you have on your alts? Do you have alts or professions?
---
Ideally you want enchanting, alchemy, tailoring on alts.  Enchant so your alt can disenchant any gear for mats, alchemy for transmute cooldowns, tailoring for cloth cooldowns.  
---
1. How many guild alchemists are good to have? What role do they perform (transmutes only?)
---
As many as you want. Although most hardcore guilds will generally funnel recipes to one or two alchemist. This is not only so they can easily gaurentee flasks for their raids... but also help to fund guild projects.
---
Those UD rogues are in for a surprise when they get wiped by all the Gnome Mages out there.

Yea man, REAL PvP is where you lose ALL your items when you die so people don't even bother to PvP and the competition dies off and you end up playing with the same 5 overgeared players who really aren't any better at the game.  /s
---
The gatekeeping for shitty PvP implementations in past MMOs is real.
---
Just because you lose more from death in other games doesn't make PvP "harder" it just makes it more punishing.

def a problem but i think the mindset of "prepare to mindlessly grind forever" is one of the biggest issues in regards to burnout
---
there are a lot of different things you can do when fatigue sets in: level professions, just go explore and find new flight paths/areas, do dungeons or run some lowbies through them, duel with friends, world pvp, etc
---
all that stuff may slow down your rush to 60 but it will bring the game alive and extend its shelf life quite a bit
---
and of course, can always just take a break and come back to the game! if nostalrius is any indication, classic is going to have legs and there's no need to rush
---
What makes you think I don’t understand this? I know this. They still underestimated because people aren’t leaving Herod. They have their names. Sure they low balled the server count, but they clearly did not mean to low ball it this much. At the current rate all of the pvp servers will be full by launch — and the game isn’t even out yet. They fucked up and need way more servers.
---
100% this
---
It’s literally a minigame that has nothing in common with the main game gameplay wise, and takes a while to do and is usually out of the way. Also People don’t play it, and yet you complain about it.
---
I never once questioned being on thalnos till now.
---
Disconnected from server.
---
Hell ya. I’m part of a twink discord that’s been active for a couple years now on private servers. I even started my own website dedicated to 19 twink gear guides, twink resources and genera information. SO PUMPED!
---
I guess you were right not wanting Italians on your server... They said I'm not deserving the citizenship if I refuse to use Italian as my main language. Also, it looks like they officially chose Gehennas as main Italian hub in classic.
---
Be aware the best hunter weapons are crossbows at endgame.
---
Haha I'm literally trying to decide between druid mage and hunter. Your posts aren't helping.
---
We eat our young.
---
I'm waiting to see if we get one more pst pvp server for another chance at name reserves.
---
How come every post on here now is, if they do this we should get this??? Its a slippery slope fellas, enjoy.
---
and yet you just add to the pile
---
Get a free starter account and add a subscription. No need for bfa or any game purchase.
---
Yeah, in my experience, this is actually how it works. 
---
I usually just right click something thats beside me and I crank it in the face immediately.
---
Gnomes have the largest penis to height ratio of all Azeroth races.  That's why everyone hates them.
---
And the old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost.
---
1. whatever you feel like
---
2. the one you prefer
---
3. the ones that I'll see fit
---
4. enough for the guild
---
Welcome to the party, give me lag and long ques all day. Just take away this layering BS.
---
Makes no sense when even the pre raid bis gear is better for healing than the tier 2 set is.
---
Don't fear it. Expect it. It will happen, and you're a fool if you take the day off and get mad bc you don't get to play until you would have just gotten home from work.
---
Imagine not waiting to take the week after launch for break and getting a perfectly smooth leveling experience, and still being close enough to get the initial rush. Suckers.
---
Eww no OG models and sounds are way better
---
Awesome, thanks. :) I'll give it a try at launch.
---
This is why I won't take the day off work.

Any discussion is better than the trash that is being submitted here every minute.
---
Came here to say this, but if you are part of a guild, give your resources to the guild crafters. Teamwork makes dreamwork.
---
There is an island west of Feralas that I would always grind two level on in my 40’s, just about the time I needed a break from the stv ptsd gank fest. Similar situation, minimal quests, low level of player interest
---
I am going to love seeing hordes of people running back and forth through quests, major cities.
---
&gt; Are there even mods here or are they just fine with 100 shitty herod and stalagg server memes a day?    
---
There are mods here. They leave the BS and ban people for thinking differently than them.
---
I remember 4h queues on Nost. Being finally able to play after waiting made everything even more exciting.
---
We know
---
You sound like you talking about PoE talent tree, classic talent tree is very simple, but was more satisfying on leveling and pointless on max lvl
---
This is actually fantastic. Appreciate the work you put into this OP!
---
I'll stay.  I'd rather have a queue than a dead server.
---
We live in the age of reboots.  And blizzard is no exception to cash in.  10 years from now expect a sc2 reboot and 15, an overwatch.  Etc etc.
---
PvP isn't about sustained dps so doesn't matter. Hunter always has the same roll in pvp. Frost trap the choke. Viper string the priest. Kite the shit out of warrior/rogue and burst on the clothies.
---
Lolwut
---
I'm with you on this. While I like the sandbox feel of the old zones, I don't necessarily think the new stuff is bad. I really enjoyed legion even though it's so different because the story was really good. It's a trade off because if the story is lacking then the zones are just bad.
---
I have a 90 min commute to/from work and discovered Josh’s podcast about 3 months ago when I ‘discovered’ Classic... I had all but disconnected from all things blizzard once Cata launched. Classic hit me like a bolt out of the blue. 
---
His podcast has totally carried me through the last few months, love his approachable style, very laid back while not being a push over, not afraid to voice his opinion and yet respect others. Great guy and flat out *awesome* content. 
---
Blizzard owes this guy a salary (or at the very least some primo swag and complementary year’s subscription).
---
And you know Aspectxd is going to be active in world chat. So we have that to look forward to.
---
WoW. I never bothered to even look into how to obtain Thunderfury (Dont main any of the classes that use it) but it sounds even tougher to get then I initially assumed.
---
Best of luck to you!
---
The people around me leveling are actually on my server. Not just an illusion created by mashing together a bunch of servers.
---
I paid $35 for 60-70 TBC guide
---
Agreed.
---
just pick the class you'll find the most fun, that will lead to your experience being as comfortable as possible.
---
It does.
---
DC woman 😀. I have three servers, Herod, thalnos and Patel. Will also roll on Myzeil (I know I spelled that wrong). You?
---
9,985 still in queue. Now what?
---
I know the stats. I've raided in them.
---
There's no reason to play classic on a pve server. World pvp is the main draw. Lotro, ff, and various other mmos have good pve content, but only classic has stvietnam and brm like experiences
---
Relax man, you're two tents.
---
SnD bound to N.  
---
Vanilla checks out....although still strangely advanced for the time.
---
I wasn't playing with randoms in Cata...
---
Early Cata hard mode dungeons took some coordination, so we'd form groups for it with people we knew, and add any new people who did well into our pool of players to bring in.
---
Knowing the tendencies of each player was so nice, and we had a lot of fun...
---
I wonder if this will be a sleeper combo in phase one. Rogue with blessing of freedom and heals has got to be super potent. HoJ stun so rogue can spend his combo points of a 5pt eviscerate sounds fun too.
---
Freedom + sprint i would think would ruin a lot of horde mage and hunter days.
---
This sub will be prime content at least.
---
Maybe you'll get lucky and get in that 20 second window someone deletes and remakes their toon.  Keep fighting the good fight brother.
---
You gonna edit your blatant lie or just let it sit there?
---
Literally doing this right now. It’s actually amazing. The story just pulls you in.
---
A lot of things like talent trees, unique class builds, raid simplicity, and the social aspect/community. The biggest thing for me is the loot though.
---
For a very long time now, items in WoW simply haven't mattered at all. Like you get a 2h sword with a high ilvl and that's all you see. I can't even name any of the items my character has on BFA.
---
In Classic, items have an identity. If I get Bonereaver's Edge, it's going to feel like I got Bonereaver's Edge rather than just some random 2h weapon.
---
8gb is plenty for wow classic lol...
---
I'm not really sure what to pick. Over the years of playing retail I mostly liked rdps in PvE, and mdps in PvP, but I mostly played healer because I could more easily get into groups that way. To facilitate this I played mostly Druid, though I've played lock and mage for a bit.
---
It seems like I don't really have an option like this in classic, as druid is kinda disappointing for the most part (on private servers I found the lack of a normal ress quite annoying, healing quite boring and tanking just not my thing). The only reason I would perhaps like to play one at this point is just the simple nostalgia and that I've kinda started identifying with the class (it just feels right to play a Tauren Druid for some reason).
---
I've considered the following:
---
- Mage seems to work very well as a class in general; it's good in PvP, good in PvE, I loved the hard CC in dungeons on private servers, and the leveling though not the fastest is quite good.
---
- Shaman seems to be an interesting class which can do some rdps pvp, and has (perhaps not optimal but fun) mdps pvp trying to fish for windfury procs, and can heal quite well in PvE. On top of that I think chain heal/lightning look fucking amazing. It does seem to be really expensive though, not wanting to use the same spec for PvE and PvP which would require quite some talent rerolls, and the rotation while leveling felt awkward.
---
- Warlock seems to me like a mage that has more cool stuff (pets, dots, curses, quest mounts, health stones, summons) but also has some more annoyances (I've never raided in vanilla but debuff limit seems quite limiting and soul shard farming to summon looks like a pain in the ass), and is seems a bit weaker in some respects (worse CC, trading sheep for fear and having barely anything in in the slow/snare department iirc). My impression (at a rather low level though) was that I could shred through mobs much more quickly than a mage, which I quite liked.
---
These three are my main considerations, any advice or corrections on my views of these classes would be appreciated. The other classes either don't really appeal to me lor
---
Same. I remember the absolute wonder of seeing “the world of Warcraft” being advertised as a coming up project and being so excited to see what it was. I loved Warcraft so much. WoW blew my mind.
---
WoW was the casual MMO when it came out, compared to MMO's that came before it.
---
Anyone can join in, that's part of the fun. :)
---
yeah thats kinda true, all it takes is a fast internet speed to be the first to log in, then just dont log off
---
Guess you're gonna need that lube lol!
---
Yes and no, what matters is
---
1. Attack speed
---
1. Learnable ability
---
Some rares, like Broken tooth are are better than others. 
---
Ability matters in the sense that some pets can learn claw, some can learn bite. Cats can learn both, and that's helpful for higher dps. For levling having both claw and bite might fuck over the pets focus for growling.
---
Here's a good resource:
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php
---
Way too many consumables but a shitty UI. Weird priorities. :x
---
Yeah, can’t wait. I’m on Shazzrah.
---
Looks like a fruit cake
---
Healthy amount of sugar and salt. keepin those engines goin.
---
You will be fine, just go in willing to learn and if you put the effort it you will be doing great!
---
I remember them saying that character services won't be offered for classic right away.
---
I'm so going to miss @mouseover and @cursor macros... Makes me rethink rolling a healer.
---
The alliance is pretty cool, not gonna lie.
---
Vanilla was the first game I ever played online, let alone an MMO. I had a blast. Beeing new doesn't preclude you from having fun at all.
---
It's not "legit" if it's against ToS
---
lol forehead  poggers
---
The thing about Classic is as far as I'm aware for now is that you start casually and have fun with it, but then it just pulls you to do hardcore stuff and you enjoy it even more with each item and each face you melt with that item.
---
If you haven't played WoW at all, no matter how bad you are this will be the sweetest memory of gaming for you :D
---
No joke. They were a dollar per gig when in bought mine.
---
Looks like I should get another one
---
is that even possible  :Face With Tears of Joy:
---
The hope to get Sulfuras never dies.
---
Discord is by far the best voice and social program for gaming in my opinion.
---
Discord
---
And you know this how? Anyone with a subscription can premake a character. That means BfA players. And who is going to stop playing Classic shortly after launch? The majority will be BfA players.
---
boooooooooo, no.
---
Literally means nothing.
---
One of the biggest tips I could give you as a new player is just to **ASK QUESTIONS!** Some people will be snobby about it, but I think you'll find that a lot of people are more than willing to help out a new player and give you some tips. If you're unsure about something, reach out to other players and you'll find the help that you're looking for. Hope to see you out there! :)
---
Well luckily for you, with the release of Classic you will no longer have to worry about a rotation in any MMO since you can hit peak numbers by hitting the same one button over and over again.
---
All my recent wow guilds (last 2 expansions, since this is when I stopped being a casual and started raiding) have used discord.
---
There will be a huge amount of pre knowledge that you will be assumed to have.
---
Everyone was bad at classic. The beauty of the game is that it rewards perseverance, creative thinking and social interaction. It's not hard, but it's going to do horrible stuff to you if you want to face roll everything.
---
If you enjoy playing with real people, can recover from a bit of frustration, are willing to do a little research online and don't expect everything to be handed to you just for pitching up, you'll probably have a blast.
---
I have a constitutional right to call someone a racial slur in the US; it would still make me an asshole to do so. 
---
If you can solve your own problem, and choose instead to waste time on reporting it to a GM, who could be using their time to do something useful like helping with bugs, you're an ass.
---
Everyone of your posts is laced with this gatekeeping bullshit propaganda.
---
"You aren't a REAL MAN unless you suck another man's dick" &lt;-some cultures actually believe shit like that, you're that guy.
---
Your argument against WoW PvP is void of any logic. You actually lose THE SAME THING as in other more "hardcore" MMOs.
---
Sure you might not lose gear when you die, but you lose time. Time is the really the only resource people have in this world. When you lose gear you just lose more time.
---
PvPing in those games doesn't mean you are more "skilled" it just means you have more time to spend on something that, at the end of the day, DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL.
---
Get over yourself, you aren't any better at PvP for playing shitty games with larger time punishments in the past.
---
for all the HS you give the tanks/heals***
---
That's how games work. That's how WoW has always worked. Blizzard has the data to prove this. That's why they've created layering to attempt to solve it.
---
It was smart to reserve names because they got a better estimate of how many more players are coming back, and clearly this was much more than their estimates. 
---
Yes, people are not moving because of their names. My friend group and I and many others I know would move off Herod if we all could keep our names, but since we can’t find servers with all of our names, we’re all staying. 
---
Blizz should have released more during registration and then merged them before launch if they were low — as one of the devs tossed around as an idea.
---
Current Alliance and Horde are not at war with each other during events of Classic, all the way to events in late Wotlk and start of Cata. PvP  is purely a gameplay mechanic, which some like and some do not. And all the power to them both, thankfully we have both normal and pvp servers available.
---
I mean min/maxing is one thing, but dungeon blues are better than every single piece of T2 for healing!
---
Faerie fire and hunters mark.
---
Not with the class that I’ll be picking.
---
This is the best pvp spec for priest in premades, and it also works better in raids.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAioobhtsc
---
heh, smart boy, you think a new game come out from thin air ?!
---
Sadly it isn’t, I found it in a very old folder of mine so I don’t have the source :(
---
I dont see where hes throwing a tantrum.
---
I think its great that the community is trying to come up with ideas instead of just sitting there complaining.
---
That is it then! See you in Elwynn Forest ;D
---
There are 2 ways to play a mmo. You go in open minded and try everything... Or you go online and learn everything before hand... I recommend option one. (')&gt;
---
THIS IS NOT SHITPOSTING. IT'S A SERIOUS, INFORMATIONAL THREAD IF YOU CARE ABOUT THIS STUFF.
---
The decision was made on Facebook groups in the last few days.
---
Also, apparently I don't deserve citizenship because I refuse to use Italian as my main language in classic. I guess you were right all along...
---
For good guilds yes. But it's fine.
---
They don't have time for playing but want to be cool and want everyone to look on them in Storm/Org, so they would pay for leveling, for raids, for pvp and won't have to play by themselves
---
HEROD HEROD HEROD HEROD! HEROD!
---
Thalnos Horde
---
HEROD!
---
HEROD!HEROD!
---
HEROD!HEROD!HEROD!
---
HEROD!HEROD!HEROD!HEROD!HEROD!HEROD!HEROD!HEROD!
---
Thanks for the info. That's all I've ever known as well, just been seeing contrary information and wanted to verify things.
---
You'll be fine, the pace is slower but that gives you a lot of time to figure out what you're doing. Group up and ask questions if you don't understand something. There are usually a lot of helpful people around if you let them know you're totally new. There's also /r/AzerothNoob if you have specific questions now or after the game actually launches. Just have fun!
---
I was talking generally. Modern programs take up plenty of ram, it's insane. Windows 10 takes up like 4gb of it
---
I'll wave if I see a Jvpiter on Herod
---
Not in phase 1 or 2. No BGs till phase 3.
---
Italians are mini part of the players, won't be a problem imo
---
People have always been mentally off, attention seeking, assholes online, just the form of how it's carried out has changed. I'm saying that the root of how people behave is pretty much still there, the vehicle of how it is delivered has.
---
No class levels in healing spec. I would look at some guides depending on what class you are deciding on leveling. It sounds like you have made your mind up about the two though so just roll pve. Sounds like you would prefer it there.
---
fair enough, not a priest player here :D
---
The only problem is you won't be be able to do much pvp till phase 3 because that's when BGs open.
---
You pretend they died and became an undead.
---
Do you think there is an advantage to having low latency? Watching Soda and Asmon trying to create 1 character I was able to make all of mine, close wow, reopen, delete a character and make a new one.
---
Cold blood + prep for ez stun lock kills.
---
It very much is. In fact, I think it's WHY people still advocate for fury in spite of a quantitative analysis of the talents prior to 30 just clearly indicating that arms talents provide more value. 
---
Like I said, if you struggle, just find a leveling buddy and do this with each of you tanking a mob but damaging both of them. This also makes it much easier to break up camps of humanoids, as of course, the downside of fighting humanoids is that they tend to have social aggro and pack close together. 
---
Anyway, best of luck.
---
Well, either getting to play and have it be a little gimped, or not getting to play, i'll choose the former. 
---
But again, the last line there "alternatively move some other stuff to the flash drive and install to c." says if he wants to be able to run it well, there's another option with the same tool that's super cheap.
---
I can bet if Herod stays this popular. It will be locked to new accounts day of release
---
Right, so the smart move was to release a higher number of servers to allow people to reserve their names, then merge the low population servers and be forced to remove the name from one of those players.
---
Because it's much more fair if one of the two players who reserved the name "Sam" is forced to rename his character before release, because some other guy got it on a completely different server.
---
As oppose to, maybe, opening up new servers during name reservation and allowing players the opportunity to grab their name on that server instead.
---
yeah i'm aware of that but while im leveling and when i reach 60 that would be helpful
---
It's not that big of a deal, I'd chose faction first and decide after that. Trolls are great, but stoneform is better for pvp, in the end it isn't *that* important for hunters.
---
what the hell are you talking about? go outside
---
I have my addons I want already installed. Is there a way I can prep my admin configs prior to launch day? Is there a dummy client or anything?
---
9 days. Less than 9 more freaking days and we get to go home boys!!
---
Ok so let's admit that I am dead set on priest for alliance, and I hesitate between priest and shaman for horde. I've tried them both and know that they both have an interesting kit. What I would need is some deciding factor that precisely doesn't depend on me because I know I can have fun with both. Is there some interesting specific interaction between warrior and priest or chaman that would make it a tiny bit more attractive than the other ? All i need is a tiny tip in my scales.
---
*rolls up sleeve to reveal a douchey tribal attempt*
---
FoR tHe HoRdE
---
I preordered Reforged a couple of months ago but wasn't aware it gave access to Warcraft as well. Thanks to this post, I could easily activate my WC3 account (as everyone my OG key is lost so I activated the game with Reforged)
---
So good so far, what a game!
---
Alliance seems to be very underrepresented on almost all servers. Hope it evens out before launch. :/
---
A drawback of guns in dungeons and sometimes quieter raids is the BLAM...BLAM...BLAM sound it makes.  Over time some people in your group will really grow tired of it
---
Couldn't agree more with everything you said.
---
The thing that I'm most excited about classic is how spells are so meaningful, and therefore, feel so powerful.
---
For all the amazing visual effects modern wow has, spells don't really feel like they have any impact because everyone can do everything, and everyone is very powerful in the world. So spell casting albeit visually beautiful, doesn't really feel very rewarding, since at the end of the day you are standing there watching your character wave their hands around when you could just....hack and slash at them faster and more effectively.
---
Where in classic, spells DO feel incredible. Rooting a mob or several, is the difference between life and death. You might stand there waving your hands but what comes out (if it doesn't get resisted) will have an effect that is impactful beyond what a mere mortal could do with a stick. 
---
This is gonna sound weird, but in a sense....Classic just *makes sense* in a weird way. Like how breath runs out faster making you desire potions or buffs that help it. The difficulty in it clicks in a way that makes sense and actually adds to the world.
---
Can't wait for the 27th
---
lol hrode has less controlled zones than the alliance.
---
meanwhile alliance has easy access to the entirety of blackrock mountain, including molten core and blackwing lair
---
"Oh so you don't like that part of classic? Maybe then you should stick to completely different game?" That's basically how it sounds
---
Because most people don't realize that the diehard classic community is, in the grand scheme of things, laughably small. The population from people just coming and trying out classic from retail is probably going to double or triple the current population, and then most of those people will quit, because classic wow isn't for everyone and it takes a lot of time investment that people might not have.
---
Sure thing. I have a speed level strat I've been cooking up. You just run up to mobs and right click until they're dead. Easy.
---
Ah yes, how could I forget Reddit’s #1 rule: America bad. Europe good.
---
The honor system is in phase 2, til then just world PvP without any other rewards than being the one who get to live.
---
He sold?
---
Multiple new characters, new items, new enemies, new maps. They seem to be planning 4-5 major updates a year, with tuning and bug fixes in between. I clocked something like 100 hours on it and still go back to play it every so often.
---
A few hours every day though....
---
You're asking about the starter edition, which is free up to level 20
---
[More information about the starter edition here](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/3226)
---
comes down to this.  You're fine through BWL.  AQ40 you get two trinket upgrades, when most dps get pretty significant weapon upgrades.
---
The crux of the issue is this.  Every piece of gear at a specific i level can only have so many stats on it.  Hunters are the only class that need 3 traits (agi, stam, and int) whereas every other dps class only needs 2.  
---
That being said, hunters bring needed utility (tranq) raids, I wouldn't put too much into it, while super hardcore guilds will bring probably 2 hunters, the others will still bring 4-5 hunters and be fine.  My guild ran 4 in vanilla, and we were fine.
---
Experience. The better you become at playing Warlock the better you'll know how to manage threat. It's not a big issue in MC/BWL, but come AQ/NAXX if you know what you're doing you will be top 1-2 DPS most fights. Git Gud &amp; L2P and by time you hit end game raiding in T3 you'll know the little tricks to reduce threat/not pull aggro.
---
He's chad
---
Vanilla Crushridge intensifies
---
Dude what the hell do you think? It’s a 15 year old game, and you run current games at 60+ frames.
---
So Golemagg is Brexit country?
---
Everything turns to ash in my mouth. I can't go back to pservers after playing the real thing.
---
I shall be :) for sure and the rare green drop will just help
---
I thought I was weird for doing this. I've deleted and renamed a few characters so I'm hoping others are doing the same. I plan on friending the people with the name because I want to know what kind of person also wants to be named after a Mean Girls character. 
---
Four for you, Glencoco, if you're out there on Whitemane. Also, Ianmalcolm.
---
Imagine caring so much you would act like a jackass like this.  Stay retail, classic doesnt need this kind of toxicity
---
Let me know which one you go with, I'm thinking about doing the same.
---
yeah im playing gnome and the first green 2h im getting from the elite quest in dunmorogh is pretty fast (2.8)
---
Hamstring kiting feels super weird with that
---
This is not how it is going to be on launch... layering will enable everyone to log in to the server eventually, you won't have to wait for someone to log out.
---
Horde / Faerlina  
---
LFM to join experienced raiding guild in classic. Currently all content cleared and still currently raiding. We plan to switch over to classic and play here as well! Looking to play with members that are experienced to atleast c'thun and know vanilla like that back of their hands for world buffs and quests. HMU  Doomelf#7740
---
I really freaking hope so.
---
Nope, I love Overwatch. I just don't want to hear discussion about Overwatch's role queue and medal/card system here.
---
He said today that the auto looting addon would save ~8 hours itself!
---
You can switch sets after trash groups (except maybe before Broodlord) and only use the max-heal stuff for bosses. You'd still spend most of your ingame time with the gear you want, instead of the BiS stuff.
---
I remember this one time I had my guildie running me thru SFK in classic. Fucking shadowfang drops. I tell him he can take it as payment for the run. Will not take it, convinces me to take it.
---
You guys...what would it be like if there were NO QUEUES?? Do you think that's possible???? Is this all a pipe dream?
---
Smart guild. You’re out farming for them, all they did was make it more efficient for you.
---
Seriously though really cool of them to do. Also cool of you to help out the guild even though you never raided.
---
I also enjoy being able to put in my own stat weights. I dont trust numbers that I cant see how they were calculated and on top of that they change depending on your gear and buffs.
---
wouldn't it be easier to get skinning/leatherworking until you have enough greens to disenchant, then drop lw for enchanting?  On the stress test I don't even think I got 58 linen by the time I was 15.
---
ok i was wondering, cuz I also thought that was a shit-ton of intellect flasks
---
Exactly! Gotta have someone to direct all the hatred towards. Looking forward to meeting in barre, alliance dog. Lok’tar Ogar!
---
I remember taking hours planning my quest chains and locations. It was half the fun for me!
---
This is actually not getting enough attention. This is sick.

priest levels fastest with a wand

Makes you feel so special.
---
Even Illidan is not that prepared
---
Thanks for the response! I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos about classic WOW and looking up tips and tricks. This game really seems one of a kind and I'm quite excited to give it a try! :)
---
You don't need a tax return to use an escrow service, and $1000 dollars isn't a lot of money for a bet.
---
I'm basically betting that WoW Classic devs have learned from retail's mistakes, and you're betting that they haven't. What does any of that have to do with taxes?
---
Sorry but not like herods
---
We'll just end up corpse running into them, no biggie really.
---
I'd like to see additional stats
---
\- pop that don't count if they have chars on different servers
---
\- pop based on the first char made only
---
Absolutely, and it can also be worth it to disenchant your first couple green quest rewards if they don't have great stats because of how huge wands can be for your efficiency. Probably more important for priests than locks/mages.
---
Can you elaborate on this? I've heard it a couple times. I've only met Mark once, just a few months back. He was nice, polite, intelligent, and fun to hang out with. Obviously I don't know him well, but the behavior I hear people like you describe seems out of sorts with the guy I met.
---
I mean you can just not logout except on reset day if it becomes a problem.
---
Good call.  Josh is awesome.  
---
We could also show appreciation by tipping him on Kofi or subscribing to his Patreon.  Or buying something from his merch store.
---
Yeah I also thought the greater nature had a round-bottom flask appearance, but I must be thinking of the regular NPP.
---
No queues will be sweet. Start being Australian
---
Amazing they even got rid of them in the first place.
---
Exactly lol
---
you gotta up your metal game man.  start here:
---
bathory
---
dissection
---
emperor
---
enslaved
---
bolt thrower
---
Razorgore would be a pretty epic gamer name
---
Logging in before server launch does NOT guarantee shit. I did this for stress test and was DCed then thrown into queue then got servers incompatible and on and on 
---
(I'm not mad about it still or anything) 
---
Just a heads up to those of you who try to login early thinking you're gonna be clever
---
🦀11$🦀
---
That's unfair for new people who want to reserve names
---
I'm Ok with that, I have to work Tuesday.
---
I've thought about it big time and I might end up doing that.
---
I just remember in the summer waiting for my dad to go to work so that I could jump on his computer and play my druid. I remember when I first got my cheetah form running all the way through the barrens from north to south because I was "so fast." Too many cherished memories to list.
---
I just want to let you know, i did check my messages... i was sad.  I have a few friends playinf classic but none of them took time off or can host any kind of party.  I am still jealous but thankfully EU is to far away for a realistic LAN party.
---
:) try to remember, you don't have to be a hardcore tryhard.  Find the right guild for you, enjoy an hour or two a week, and try not to stress it.
---
There's more to leveling on a pvp server than theorycraft numbers.  Or to put it another way, numbers are only useful if you measure the correct things (and measure them correctly).
---
And no, the heavyweights don't all agree on best leveling pet.  15 years means a lot of the best theory is old and not easy to find.
---
deadzone isn't bigger, just further away.
---
That's what I plans to do. Got so good at the wand mace weaving that it's really all I need until 15ish honestly
---
Completed TFT today, the hype got worse
---
It's not so bad once you have a wand and keep up with maintaining a good one. Sure you can't kill as fast as some other classes, but you have much better survivability and can pull off things other classes can't.
---
Yes but I believe its different for a gigantic EU PvP community spread over 3 realms
---
Raiding karazhan with a guild that included several real life friends was the most fun I ever had.  I was druid heal, which was op in bc if you played correctly. The constant wipes initially followed by the first kill and then progressing to mastery was pretty awesome.  I also happened to like 10 man raiding more than larger raids because you could really get to know everybody and everybody was pretty invested in the guild doing well.  When I moved into 25 mans I liked it a lot less because it was way less personal and the dkp loot system became less fun.  Later raids like in cata were already too easy and weren’t as fun.
---
My saving Grace will be the fact I'm undead so lots of humanoids.
---
Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it! :)

---
man i can't wait for classic
---
No one cares about your relationship. Thank you for rubbing it in
---
Given me classic
---
Even without heirlooms my new characters were doing green quests at the end of a Cataclysm zone during Legion days.
---
I played retail after the stress test till about level 20 as mage. Took only a couple of few hours. I hade over 300 gold. I couldn’t believe it. I soloed all the way to duskwood. Didn’t die once even tho I would sometimes take on 3 mobs. No one quests together. My invites were always denied.  I can’t believe how easy the made the game. I won’t even go into the dumbed down spell system.  Come on classic come on.
---
[Gotta agree here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/crqjho/warrior_leveling_spec/)  
---
Awesome dicussion going on, but apparently belongs in a 4 day old megathread to get drowned out in the "I'm afraid people will think im hardcore if I pick Dwarf Priest" and "I'm afraid I won't be able to join raids if I'm not Dwarf Priest" replies.  
---
Sigh
---
If i cant grief newbies to quit the game whats the point?
---
Im on the other side of the boat.... Id like WoW to look like old WC3
---
I moved from Herod to Stalagg. It will end up high/full by launch day so I'm not worried about the realm being empty. 
---
Plus you're crazy if you think I've waited all this time to sit in 4+ hour queues for the first few weeks.
---
It would be marginally better if it wasn't improv tribal..
---
dont leave herod, we need to stay there so they dont get the idea of making more servers which will be dead in a months time because they arnt herod
---
How can I play this? Do you have a link? I remember this from way back in the day
---
Yeah I had a terrible experience for the name reservation but what I noticed on the stress test was they actually opened up the server about 5 mins before. My theory is if you wait for for it to turn from offline to on it will be better than just trying to login directly at launch
---
Oh yeah I totally forgot about that... guess I'm just gonna gear up first and get on my feat with gold. Thanks!
---
That's what I thought as well, so I just bound my mouse wheel to targetting party members, Up/down is 1/2 shift+up/down is 3/4. Click in is for myself.
---
I can't comment on the other names, but Ming at least wasn't respected as an actual good pvp'er on Lightning's Blade itself.  The alliance on LB had other bg pre-made groups that were much harder to beat.  Running into Ming's group was free honor.  Also it wasn't uncommon to see a comment like "just ruined Ming's pvp video" in chat, meaning he got the jump on someone and failed.
---
He wasn't bad by any means, but his videos are heavily cherry picked.  Anyone that also played Horde LB at 60 would be able to confirm that.
---
It takes like a minute. Also you're the one angry about it, don't get mad at that guy for correctly acknowledging how silly it is to be mad at something so dumb.
---
What scene or where was the dragon flying by? In the space and the weird pink thingy flying through the stars?
---
Okay
---
NO
---
Ventrilo. Duh
---
I've name changed my names like 15x lol
---
Just get a good wand, and keep up with it. Replace it every so often. 
---
Also spec into Spirit Tap and improved wand specialization. You'll have very minimal downtime if you do it right.
---
Invest in a good wand every few levels, spec shadow, keep a set of healing gear around for dungeons.
---
I wouldn't really put points into healing per say, you can heal while levelling just fine even if you're almost entirely shadow spec other than the 5 points in wand specialization.
---
I’m just saying that it feels shitty when the literal only time you’re needed is for a single room of one raid tier. That’s what op was asking for
---
Oh fuck.
---
The in game social tab looks like it will be in classic, and that’s what my small group of friends tend to use the most. The in game voice chat is pretty good imo
---
See you seem to forget that technology actually advanced in the past 15 years, and servers can/will/do have a higher capacity than what was capable back in 2004-06.
---
&gt; Nobody is exploiting anything. 
---
Assuming this is intended to be a Blizzlike server as opposed to some kind of deliberately goofy funserver, being able to heal random mobs to grief the other faction is a bug. There is no ambiguity there.
---
The expectation is that you report bugs, not exploit them.
---
&gt; I feel people these days just use the term exploit to describe anything they dont personally like lol.
---
Maybe they do, maybe they don't. But I feel you are trying to exploit this probably imaginary bad behaviour on the part of other people to pretend that exploits are not exploits.
---
Where is the redridgeboss when you need him...
---
I panicked and tried to edit my character as well and lost the name thinking we had to make the character how we wanted and name it in one go.. fuck.
---
I don't know that it's on the list, was just providing the patch notes since they asked if there was a new patch.  There's a few things with auto shot involved but nothing spelled out specifically about this.
---
depends on the length of the fight.  Most fights what you say is true, or there are opportunities to drink when you can't dps.
---
Wait what? I thought on his Twitch profile he said he expects to be world first to 60 in classic and break his old record.
---
Priest is the first class I actually committed to playing in the original vanilla beta. It's not super fast but it's a nice experience with very strong survivability. Just level as shadow spec and you can still heal dungeons anyway. It wasn't until a mid 40s dungeon where I had some minor issues healing and I fixed those with different gearing options rather than respeccing (this is when I was taught by other players about the tradeoffs with intellect and spirit gear).
---
I was able to download it through the twitch app and install it that way
---
He can't because most of it is BS, he's mostly talking about Firefall and some of the issue said studio had, such as Westcoast Customs fucking up their end of a deal, and the Game being in Perpetual Beta, ending with Mark getting fired and the Game being DOA on arrival, with most of the player base saying it was better in beta, myself among them.
---
\#nochanges amirite? I played a ret paladin in BC and did not miss this, so I think I'm going to pass on it. It's probably one of the reasons ret was a joke spec in vanilla unless you knew exactly what you're doing.
---
LMAO damn. Everyone jonesing bad af. Everyone need that HIT of classic in their lives.
---
For the Alliance!
---
I don't get why it would be bad to have it as a graphic slider or toggle. If you disagree with that then you're just selfish af.
---
&lt;Azoic&gt; recruiting for classic - EU HORDE 2 day raiding guild on Golemagg PVP
---
\- With the re-release of classic we're 5 danes wanting to form a community to raid, world pvp, hangout and other good stuff. we'd like a chilled atmosphere where you'll have the time to study, work or whatever you need time for and still be raiding at a high level, some of us have exp up to top 25 world on live servers so you'll be in good hands. with the fact that we guys know each other there won't be any ninja looting, drama or jazz like that. (we'll probably end up using loot council but we haven't decided yet)
---
\- for now the set raiding times will be 19.00-23.00 CEST thursdays and sundays. we'd like our raiding atmosphere to be really "down to earth" in the way of people wanting to show up more than "having" to. we want people to be able to go to exams, do their work etc. without being thrown off the raid team, this is also why we're aiming to get around 45-50 people in our core raiding team so raiding won't feel extreamly mandatory. This being said we ofc would want people to show up as much as possible and loot will be distributed for people that show up more than others, and we'll prio items like thunderfury for the most dedicated people.
---
\- requirements and what we expect from you:  
---
we expect you to try and stay to 1 class and keep that up to date and not play 10 class with white gear going into raid (should be fairly obvious) other than that it's a big plus if you have any form of raiding experience so you know your way around things.we'll be discussing professions for everyone and things like that before launch so dont worry too much about that. we're trying to keep the age limit at 18+
---
\- how to apply and reach out for us:   
---
you can add my discord on Daniel/shrum#8973
---
you can also go directly to our discord server on: [https://discord.gg/pKNnrJ](https://discord.gg/pKNnrJ)
---
if you came this far, i hope you consider joining our ranks to become the best 2 day raiding guild out there. have a great day, the GM Daniel
---
Montana is the state you most want to visit and the state you least want to live in.
---
Warlocks were never top dps.  They waste too many gcds on non damaging abilities like lifetap and curse of elements.
---
If you are planning to play on a PVP server, the later start will make leveling much more difficult as by November / December you will have a lot of 40+ characters running around ganking and camping lowbies. 
---
As to all other servers it will be easier since there will be less competition for the quest mobs.
---
31/8/12 was the classic man. Once you get pblade or to a lesser extent lobotomizer or barmans shanker you are two-tapping clothies and only need thistle-tea to drop someone tankier in a stunlock. 
---
All the "trispec" 21/8/22 daggers or 21/3/27 swords, were very powerful in duels but kinda meh at other times. If you are geared enough to fight constantly why wouldnt you?
---
if you had someone cleansing you or were part of a small team, then combat X/31/X of any variation could make you an absolute beast. You had all the sustained dps of a warrior, but with so much control that whoever you were "sticking" would be useless even before dying.
---
I don't remember the post asking everybody to move over, let alone 300 player guilds.  That post was more to get casual people to go over who aren't as butt hurt about having Legolas the hunter.
---
Yeah I wanted to know if someone out there could tel me If it was worth it to buy that pc 400$ and it could play wow classic like on a decent graphics settings
---
The EULA is privacy nightmare.
---
Why? So you can pretend to have accomplished something?
---
The faster you level the more money you'll make.
---
True you can but that’s still 90 scraps. Which is 90 beasts.
---
Once it’s bound it will say “soul bound” when you mouse over it.
---
The pvp gloves and boots are phase 3, you'll have raid gear by then?
---
Instances are not run on the world server and can easily handle 40 people. Wpvp gets problematic when it's more than that. All on the world server which is alsobused by people proccing trinkets without participating in the wpvp.
---
There is most likely technology in place that spreads the wserver load but when 80 people fight in one place it's just that.
---
For maximum compatibility remember to update every addon an hour or so before launch. There is probably still a lot of things that need to get fixed since the ElvUI Dev said that a real stable version (non beta) of the addon for classic at launch is probably not happening.
---
PVP is for horde only!!
---
Keep out, we're full already.
---
Yeah I may have to go that route, although weekends are usually when my girlfriend and I spend most a lot of our time together ( I work morning during the week, she does evenings) I suppose I was just hoping to do most of my wowing between 3pm-10pm on weekdays
---
Sounds like something Sally from Third Rock would say.
---
on streamer server
---
The main argument for no changes, is because Blizzard can’t be trusted. They’ll surely use ANY change as an excuse for more change.
---
Cool
---
I played Horde Shaman in vanilla beta but my group of friends wanted to go Alliance at launch because of the racials. So I ended up a NE Druid as my main. I look forward to joining the Horde again!
---
You never played a Warlock and/or you never played AQ40/NAXX....
---
Im gonna import moaning sounds into MSBT right now.  Every time i get a crit or windfury "OOOH YEESS"
---
Honest question - Can't Blizzard just allocate more server memory or processing power or whatever to handle this stuff?  Maybe dynamically?  I'm assuming it would cost more money. Wondering how feasible it is to do, cost aside.
---
I really prefer PVE, so I rolled on the RPPVE server. PVP is not for me, hopefully the queues will be better.
---
Don't know who this guy is, but I am super curious now. Going to give him a listen.
---
I did it in the stress test. It wasn't horrible. It wasn't kargoz speedlevel mode, but I doubt many are that anal.
---
The only medium servers left are Bloodsail Buccaneers, Grobbulus, and Stalagg.
---
Everything else is either high or full.
---
be cAreful the nazis on here might ban u for talking about the forsaken pservers ((( even tho classic wouldnt exist wo pservers )))
---
the only name on this sub that actually sounds kinda cool and devastating to be a meme.
---
There is no single "Whole idea of classic."  the "Whole idea of classic" is precisely in the fact that you can enjoy it however you want, and for some people leveling is not what they enjoy about classic.
---
That's like saying the "Whole point of classic" is 40 man raiding or Hillsbrad Foothills PvP.  Yes, for some people those are their favorite parts but for others they hate that and would never touch it in a million years.
---
Would you rather pay $60 up front and have tons of micro transactions for convenience stuff?
---
If you can't afford it, you can't afford it. It sucks but it's reality.
---
Think of it this way. If you skip 3 of your Starbucks coffees in a month, that pays for your sub. Or skip 1 meal eating out. It's not very hard to rearrange your monthly budget for $15.
---
How do you purpose to fit over 30,000 sardines in a 3 slot can sir. Are player's still able to roll on Herod?
---
Took me a second
---
&gt;why does forsaken have arrows
---
Sylvannas Windrunner, maybe you've heard of her?
---
Fortitude pots and Mighty Trolls Blood pots I think
---
I mean, we lost quantity for quality talents.
---
Sure we had 50 points at 60 but 40 of those went into talents that gave 1% mana or 1% hitrating.
---
And i get it. I feels bad only getting talents every 15 lvls but it was basicly the same in classic. Only the 21point and 40 point talents had a real impact for most specs.

/e farts on [target]
---
As a Warrior it was probably when some random passerby helped me kill the lvl40 elite needed for my whirlwind axe when I was like lvl31. 20 seconds out of someone's day but made such a huge difference to a low-level Warrior. 
---
Ever since if I'm ever bored at 60 I'll take a trip up to Hillsbrad and help any other warriors, even opposite faction to complete that quest.
---
You'll basically be  missing out on everything that's worth playing. Might as well not play. F R E S H
---
You'll be fine. Classic isn't going anywhere and there will be constant flow of people joining and dropping the game.
---
In reverse is how you look like to the horde
---
The devs. Ion has said it and one of the others said it.
---
Pretty sure druids are pretty powerful in all BGs. They the meta flag runner in WSG and in a massive AV they can stealth behind enemy lines and heal commando groups or throw hits into the  a big battle where I doubt people are tabbing and spamming dispels. Same goes for AB though maybe dispels help more in smaller battles.
---
Kinda hard when everyone is decked out in Naxx gear lol.
---
I HAD NO IDEA
---
Love your vids man. Mega chill and entertaining.
---
Am i the only one that remembers that u wont be able to get pvp gear untill phase 3 cus u need marks from the BGs? :O :P
---
I thought so too, but kiting between autoshots works like a charm! Much easier than the rogue/warrior i leveled to 10 in stress test, and more interesting than mage's 1-9 "rotation".
---
I think you mean Gollum.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night lol you really wanna justify staying on herod but this isn't the right argument to do so
---
Shadow priest is one of the top two 1v1 classes in classic.
---
They had the stress test but that’s it. 
---
From here forward, it’s subscription only.  Honestly though 15-20$ isn’t bad for the quantity of content there is.
---
Meh it looks more authentic. The forsaken one is the one that looks horrible to me.
---
Soylent for peak efficiency
---
Dispell is a helluva CD to blow on a HoT, and usually you HoT after running away in a BG or between fights.
---
If you're talking about resto druid in general in BGs, HoTs aren't that good to heal with because the main PvP damage is burst.
---
It matters if you only have a few hours to play each day.
---
Your music selection is impeccable!
---
Teamspeak! Or mumble.
---
&gt; Firstly, the player paid for all of it. Having them "miss" MC/BWL/etc... is no different than having them miss TBC raids. 
---
I think you are making a mistake here by equating making content skippable with making content impossible. You could go back to vanilla raids in TBC if you wanted to, you just did not have to. That is very different to a hypothetical scenario where you have paid for an xpac and can't access the content.
---
&gt; I can't even imagine how players felt when they had to buy all the expansions full of obselete content.
---
As far as I am aware Blizzard has only ever required you to buy the most recent xpac.
---
&gt; Let's say TBC had "outland levels." So you're 60/60 lvl character is now 0/10 Outland. Outland levels somehow make your character stronger.
---
Both 58-in-greens and fully-naxx-geared both have a reason to gain Outland levels. The 50-in-greens will be able to clear dungeons/raids more easily (possibly with fewer than 40 people now), and the fully-geared will need to gain those 10 levels to continue doing cutting edge TBC raids.
---
And let me guess, in addition to "Outland levels" that aren't levels and magically don't invalidate any content you are going to make up "Outland mobs" that are magically equally challenging for everyone regardless of gear level, "Outland loot" which is magically both an upgrade from vanilla loot but not as good as vanilla loot, with "Outland instances" that contain mobs and loot equally accessible to people in greens and Naxx purples.
---
I guess that does resolve the question of it being mathematically impossible, you just create a whole xpac's worth of entirely new mechanics that barely interact with WoW as we knew it.
---
I'm not convinced that is even possible, let alone that it would sell as opposed to be remembered as the decision that killed WoW.
---
People will be bound to disagree with me but I'll try. Note that this is for 'skill cap' so how easy it is to play at the highest levels, which is not necessarily how easy a class is to learn or play for a new person.
---
Easiest to Hardest:
---
1. Paladins. In the WoW devs own words this is the class that they made easy by design.  
---
2. Priests. Simple playstyle and simple cc mechanics, the amount of core skills is smaller than most other classes, and many of their skills are instant cast. 
---
3. Rogues. Not a particularly difficult class to play in pvp, despite their reputation as notorious pvpers. Preparation rogues are the most complicated of the bunch since they have essentially twice the cooldowns. 
---
4. Warriors. Fairly easy in most cases, but you need to switch between stances and weapons to use intercept/disarm/spell interrupt. Those mechanic alone makes warriors more difficult to play at the most competent levels than the above 3. 
---
5. Shamans. You have a larger number of useful and commonly used spells that are relevant than pretty much any other class, and also totems have 4 designated spell groups that you need to choose the appropriate one for each type during battle. Ele is more complicated than the other specs. 
---
6. Hunters. Weapon range deadzones, pet micro, trap placement through feign deathing. Not a lot of abilities that you need to use usually, but you need to have good micro and kiting ability. Being able to make the optimal number of ranged attacks while being chased by a melee is a more difficult mechanic than most classes need to deal with. 
---
7. Mages. Lots of relevant spells, especially on frost. Lowest health class that needs to avoid damage through damage avoidance or immunity abilities. Most reactive class and it has a lot of choices to make during combat and has the ability to affect group combat a lot so you need better situational awareness than really any other class.  
---
8. Warlock. A fair number of abilities, needs good situational awareness. Biggest skill requirement for them is the controlling of and situational usage of their pets. They need to more actively control their pet's abilities unlike the hunter and they need to switch pets, potentially even while in combat, depending on what matchups they run into. 
---
In PVE the complexity goes like this: 
---
1. Tanks
---
2. Hunter (generally the only class who has any unique roles outside of basic boss mechanics)
---
3. Everyone else
---
A 40 man raid usually bring 4 warlocks with 1 shadow priest in the same team. Warlocks are one of the least played class. Raid spot are not an issue.
---
Mario
---
If you're rolling Tauren druid, the chances are you won't have to face this quite as badly as Night Elves. Priest's dispel ability is pretty mana hungry, especially compared to Purge from Shamans. 
---
There are some situations in BGs where Priests are simply going to spam dispelling a target, but these situations are rare and most of the time their attention will usually be split between that and healing/mana burning/dispelling allies. Compared to Shamans who have the primary focus of Heal/Dispel.
---
What I'm saying is, Purge is a bitch, if you're a Tauren you probably won't have to worry about it half as much in the average Battleground.
---
Guardian of Tirisfal's staff

A few meme names (Pagle, Mankrik)
---
Cool sounding dragon name linked to a Greek aesthetic npc
---
It isn't Kel'thuzzad, Doomhammer, or Windrunner, but they're still pretty good.
---
Oh wow ok you convinced me
---
Makes no sense to me.If its m/d/y then why do they call their independance day 4th of july and not july the 4th ?
---
Good, that means we're closer to the real classic experience.
---
Then why are the changes I mentioned ok?
---
Good to know. Super excited for it
---
People don't dispel hots much in bg pvp because they don't do enough healing to make a difference. In a duel or 2v2 fight sure, but in group pvp in bgs where 3 people attack the one person people die in about 3-5 seconds when focused, HoTs are just too slow to matter.  
---
In small scale pvp it is very annoying though to have priests and shamans stripping all your hots. It's not as annoying as them dispelling your innervate and natures grasp though.
---
Herbalism alchemy is a really good route to take for your teas (replenishes energy). Rogue was really the best class in wow if you are good. It has the 2nd (?) Highest skill cap i think.
---
Honestly, not a fan chief. Classic hasn’t even started yet and you’re already trying to push a LFG-esque tool? Why not just type LFG in chat or whisper players questing near you to group up? There are going to be tons of people on at all times - it just seems redundant to go thru this hassle, and takes away from player to player interaction. I don’t mean to sound like a complete dick, but yeah, not into this idea at all.
---
I'm not sure "forced" is the right word but I think your point as a whole is a separate argument. And it's not one I have a problem with but the vast majority of people I've seen who are mad about it mainly referenced how long it takes. And everything is subjective, I know, but getting as mad as people get at playing a little crab game that you can forget about in 1 minute is just so damn stupid and indicative of how unreasonable the player base can get. Which is important context when you criticize the design decisions Blizzard makes. But yeah, I mean that's fair.

There are server discord’s as well. There should be a few invites codes if you search this sub.
---
Personally I'll just Skin and buy the low level Wands from the AH. You don't have to fully commit to Enchanting. You can just pick Skinning and enchanting and drop it once you have your Wands. Wands later on are either Vendor Whites, Quest rewards or Dungeon drops anyway.

Did you see that WoW Classic Advertisement video he made with all the callers and fans? Brought a tear to my eye! High quality production on all fronts and looking forward to playing WoW Classic witth the Countdown to Classic community.
---
It’s nice to get a mount right when you can but higher levels get more gold more easily so just ignoring profs and levelling even if you don’t have enough G for a mount until a few levels past 40 (you probably will if you buy skills prudently and vendor everything) &gt; tarrying at lower levels to grind professions and trying to make G off that in a nascent economy. Like really, do whatever your play style is but I’m more and more convinced that ignoring profs while levelling from launch is much more efficient.
---
And a (*) next to his name...
---
Keep in mind enemy buffs are invisible unless a mage casts the Detect magic on a person. Only priests (for alliance) can do offensive dispel, not something used often in group PVP. On top of everything your main heal is healing touch since HOTs mechanic in Classic only allows one of that hot on any single target, so no multiple rejuvs. 
---
Now if you want to heal in group PVP shaman is amazing with chain heals and totems, druids are only unmatched in WSG as a flag carry.
---
One thing I noticed in the beta, is the gray robes give more strange dust than the small shards that you need for the wand. I would DE my 9 robes, and not have enough mats for the runed copper wand and the wand itself.
---
Consider making some of the white +1 int robes, when I DEd those I guy way more shards.
---
I did think about how the server flux will likely be over and I wont have to worry about queues as I see some threads about that going on right now
---
Most of your wands as a priest can be attained via quests/dungeons pretty easy. Google class priest wands and I'm pretty sure a dozen sites with lists and details will pop up. 
---
As for money, a bank ult is always clutch. I plan on leveling as tailoring/skinning or one of the other gathering professions. Sell off the leather and send the greens from tailoring to your bank to disenchant and sell.
---
People would lose their names in the case of merges. From the whole name reservation rage thing we can tell that people are very attached to their name, so it wouldn't be an ideal solution either.
---
NE paired with a cat is great for wpvp and anchoring flags in premades.
---
I’m constantly recommending this podcast to people. Great job Josh!
---
I log multiple times to check if my name is still in my account.
---
If you guys are going to take any days off do it on like the friday of the launch week. You end up getting more play time in the end.
---
You won't really miss out on anything (especially not PvE wise). Think about how much time it takes people to level, then to get a 40  man group and then how much loot drops per raid.
---
&gt;while still not being able to crit.
---
Just so people aren't confused by this, glancing blows do not affect your crit chance until you hit the crit hard cap.
---
That cap is when the total percentage of melee strike outcomes exceeds 100%.   
---
Outcomes being parry, block, dodge, miss, glancing blow, crit.   
---
If your target is level 63 you have 40% GB, and lets say there's 5% parry, 5% block, 5% dodge, that's a total of "special" outcomes totalling 55%.   
---
Meaning the crit hard cap would be 45%. If you attack 46% crit you will still only crit 45% of the time.   
---
Lets say you also miss 5% of the time, now the crit hard cap is 40%.
---
These are just theoreticals of course. You wouldn't be parried or blocked by a boss, because you're behind it. And the values I used are wrong.
---
Keen to get more clarity on whether or not things like this are bannable. Would be amazing for dad life on the couch.
---
Was about the same but for UO and DAoC. WoW came after those two.
---
full mana and hp as well
---
Sure
---
Well thats a take =)
---
Yeah I'm dumb I thought you meant the opposite
---
Have Stalagg name: Dalinar, Win
---
Looking for Win on Herod.
---
Thats good to hear. I'm not really worried about the ganking as I will probably level an alt.
---
Is there any way to ‘update’ the alpha or do I have the install this completely new (and lose my keybinds etc from stress test)
---
Naxx gear??
---
Nothing like nitpicking the random number someone pulls out of their a hole
---
Then you were Warlocking wrong. I server/Horde first most of AQ40/NAXX as a Warlock and pretty much top 1-3 DPS, beating ignite mages a lot of the time.
---
MC/BWL Warlock is medicore DPS yes, but a GOOD &amp; WELL GEARED Warlock AQ/NAXX will completely fuck shit up as they scale extremely well with gear and spell hit.
---
I still want to know what Blizzard was smoking when they designed viper sting.
---
The updated water and textures are not part of the client. They came with Cataclysm.
---
iGnome
---
Kazzak 100% not kiteable on 1.12.
---
bwl/r14 gear is free. Naxx geared pvp is stupid because the damage is too high.
---
Man, just google what Blizz said.
---
Skinning and First Aid during leveling, everything else can wait.
---
Thanks! A lot of it's just transcribing from Wowhead, but nominal ilvl and good obtain level don't always match up, nor is ilvl a reliable indicator of a worthwhile item. Plus I wavered deciding what to transcribe until it settled into what you see on the druid page.
---
I’ve played alliance up to level 8 during vanilla. Then went horde for the rest of my wow time. I really wanna go alliance this time
---
I hope Brack hated every second of announcing that after what he said. It's too bad that one of the original devs couldn't have been the one to announce Classic. Brack shouldn't have gotten to be the one, even if he did hate it.
---
Just like real life!
---
Well to be fair you can choose to play a lower pop server
---
I tried Horde once, but I could never get used to the major cities. I love my Alliance capitals.
---
I definitely ran a tauren shaman to level 10 on retail after the open beta closed. Hadn't played retail since Wrath and so much had changed. I can see why folks are ready for classic.
---
Really thanks to everyone, does anyone of you have tested the game with hardware like the one inside the Matebook D (Ryzen 2500u etc etc)?
---
Because there will be launch day queues? Launch day queues, however, does not in any way imply that those people will still be around 6 months later.
---
"not the actual launch experience"
---
What an idiot.
---
You needed a sub for the stress test too
---
What did they do to dueling?
---
y tho
---
Feel any better?
---
Seems kinda like forced diversity I dunno
---
Probably combat daggers through phase 3, then Seal Fate once your in decent AQ40 gear.
---
If you Google for wow addons most of the websites now have "Classic" section. Last I checked majority of the old addons are back with the exception of the ones that rely on the data no longer available from the client.
---
\- I try to limit the number of addons I use and not use any cosmetic addons (I like the classic UI fine)
---
\- yet I author addons, I think you should all use "[Better Vendor Price](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info25078-BetterVendorPrice.html)" to get full stack and per item and per current stack sell price information 
---
\- I hope LFD/LFR addons are never maid for Classic unfortunately it seems they are already...
---
I believe this is mostly for starting areas where you are low level and don’t need much skill to hit with a weapon
---
Isn’t that just Swifty’s alter ego?
---
lmao you got wrecked
---
Some random frost Mage taught me, a lower level frost Mage, how to AoE grind. It changed my life within WoW. I passed on the knowledge to another frost Mage months later when they saw me doing the same thing.
---
Plenty of ways to try it for free. In fact some of those became so popular that you could argue that it's why we will get Classic: Blizzard just couldn't  ignore the demand anymore.  But since we here are official now you will have to ask Google how to get to those unofficial alternatives.
---
I don't like him either but I think he meant the long queue time and server crash experience in 2004.
---
Ion racial ability: Send targeted enemy to their own layer where they will die alone.
---
#1 reason I will never play a Troll. I know it's dumb, but I just can't get over it.
---
Wow was literally THE MMO that made MMO's popular and to make something popular it has to be at least somewhat casual friendly so yes, new players will potentially even have more fun than old players.
---
I truly envy you guys starting a MMO for your first time and it gets to be the god amongst men of MMO's.

2019 WoW Classic.
---
2020 FF7 Remake.
---
I can honestly say, I'm fine with never playing a new game again. I know what I like, and I know what games I love. FF8 is getting an HD release, Grandia 1/2 have HD releases coming. Onimusha 2/3 will probably get a Steam release eventually.
---
Just gonna slide right into Grob and start leveling.
---
Yeah, you mentioning it, I wish I had screenshots from 10 years ago. Dang...yep gotta get this add on now! Thanks
---
go orc shaman if you're on a pvp server
---
thank me later
---
Yes pls
---
You seem so nice. It's a shame to have to kill you. :(
---
See you soon as well,  
---
-An Aggressive Alliance Priest
---
Yeah, flare makes it impossible to open from stealth, and if you lay your ice trap and flare right on it, they can't disarm it. You were close but this was more often what happened.
---
Ice trap, flare right on top of it, stand right on top of ice trap. They approach (because they literally have no choice), get yanked from stealth, you mark them and arcane shot. Prepare to step backwards and keep the ice trap between you and the rogue. They have no choice but to get trapped.  
---
Once trapped, Cheetah, run to max distance, Hawk again, Aimed, Serpent, lay another ice trap, auto...if they get close enough before they're dead ice trap or scatter shot to give yourself distance and rinse repeat.
---
It got to the point where I felt bad dueling them and it was like taking candy from a baby. If you don't make any mechanical mistakes you can' t lose.
---
Don't see it to be honest even though I wish it was. Ah well, you can't have it all in classic and that's the beauty of it.

For a lot of people the game doesn’t begin until 60.
---
It’s been done on all the major private servers. There will be guilds that require you to hit 60 in a week or you’ll get kicked.
---
90 is still 90 beasts and unlike pservers you can’t skin anything until you get outside the first starter area and into the actual zone. That’s still putting you 10 skill shy of 40. It also costs more silvers to train lw craft a bunch then drop it to train tailoring if you’re planning on keeping tailoring anyways.
---
Sure it might be quicker than cloth gathering. I don’t think it is though. I got 30+ linen from my first humanoid kill quest in Mulgore.
---
Even if this is satire, it's still cringe

Pls no, im still in my 20s

A woman who played a male dwarf priest during Vanilla, helped my guild down Nefarian. Then disappeared.

I got a random mail in-game from them. Opened it at the Aldor-side Inn in Shattrath during Burning Crusade.

"You don't know me. But I love you."

There was nothing depressing about vanilla for me, and I raided up to naxx, so whoever titled that shit can go fuck themselves rly, it was great pve and pvp/worldpvp

That wasn’t ion that said that.

Those gloves are phase 2 and the alliance version. Just so you're aware.

Blizard's server, blizard's rules. If you stay cycling options for 12 hours, it's 99% certain you are a bot. They don't have to prove you are a bot to ban you.

Hell no. I got Woyer on Whitemane and you can bet your sweet ass I'm gonna be having a grand old time swinging my big dick axe around trying to kill 1 mob and bandaging in between.

I don't care how full it is, I'm just here for a good time :^)
---
Save for later
---
It's not going to be all servers. The ones that get warned like Herod and do not switch are the ones that are going to experience this. They have plunty of servers they can roll out if they become full, like they just did for est pvp. 
---
I am going to laugh though all the people that are all "I have way too much invested on this server already" on a game that hasn't even launched yet.
---
Don't like que times? Get your guild or friend group to swap servers to a new or low pop one. You know what's worse than getting your friends to all agree on a new server? Not play the game because you are in a four hour que every day for two weeks. I don't understand these people.
---
Classic horde, doesn’t even have thunderfury
---
Dude that is sick.  Makes me want to roll a lock.
---
You weren't there for name reservation?
---
That's an amazing story and I wish I had more nice people like you in my guild on Myzrael. ^^
---
Not even a few hours on a sunday? Cause then you could, get a few levels and maybe be lvl 30 with 1,5lvl rested once november hits:)
---
I think it depends on your class. A level 5 warlock with Corruption + Immolate + Imp is already killing things extremely efficiently, whereas a priest would really benefit from a wand. I will be playing a lock so I will likely feed some mats to a guildie in exchange for a minor wand at about level 8, and then just buy the next wand outright somewhere between level 13-15.
---

Anyone have any input on the state of shadow priest in classic? I played one in tbc and loved it just can’t remember what they were like in classic
---
Love the Icon of Shadows. Troll for life!
---
Waht? Don’t think I follow, did I jump bk in time to when blizz wasn’t about profit maximisation? Nothing like charging for betas, having cash shops etc. integrity towards gameplay first is entirely gone - their games still have plenty of polish to be sure, but there’s a reason we have lootboxwatch. Activision Blizzard having gone to shit is easily one of the biggest reasons to look forward to Classic.
---
Nah, warstomp + chainlighting + NS lightning bolt + earth shock &gt;&gt; resisting some stuns
---
Here's a good link, but not SUPER high quality, though pretty good: [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Crests](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Crests)
---
Yeah unfortunately they are drd for the patch classic will be in, it's pretty controversial and allot of ppl say it should be seen as just a bug but as it stands its intended so us hunters are gonna have to adapt.
---
I had 2 low level Wands drop within 30 minutes from the harpies on the east side of Mulgore during this last stress test, maybe really lucky but that would be a quick way to get one

Which is annoying because boomer is any late twenty to early thirty year old who is slowing becoming their parents but a bunch of angry twenty somethings bitching about baby boomers enter conversations bitching about 60 year olds telling them get a job and buy a home even though everything is inflated and you can’t support a family on a single average income and blame it on boomers. 
---
Boomers =/= baby boomers.
---
Depends on what class you are playing against. 
---
Vs plate targets hemo + cold blood is best imo. Low energy cost CP builder, main source of damage is eviscerate which has static damage. 
---
Vs cloth wearers backstab imp Sprint is crazy and you can burst people super fast with thistle tea (and ZG rogue set trinket once that is available.) There are a few other specs you can play but these are the ones I see most commonly.
---
One of the best responses I’ve ever seen.
---
Unless you want to re-level a profession, as a cloth wearer tailoring is a must. Mages, Warlocks and Priests have a BOP chest epic chest piece that rivals most of MC items. So it is kind of a must and easy epic.
---
For the second profession I would go with something gathering: skinning for easy, herbalism or mining for a bit more money but a bit more hassle.
---
How does your screen look like that? Mine doesnt have the picture in the background, the colors, or anything
---
Uncanny
---
I don't think this guy ever left 2008.
---
it's just fallen out really bad since legion and late wod. They started introducing way too much unbalanced shit and classes randomly one shotting each other due to pve items. The 2019 state of PvP and overall class balance is somehow miles worse compared to a version of the game that came out more than a decade ago, which is hilarious to me.
---
They never said this. In fact they actually said they are staring with this amount of servers and will roll out more as they fill up. Can we stop with the blizz trolling on this sub?
---
Are you using old reddit? Http://old.reddit.com the new reddit design sucks.
---
Blizzard's rts/arpg re-releases are terrible, overpriced, and unnecessary, though. Just replay the original.
---
If you want to rank competitively your going to have a hard time finding a spot. Premade only bring 1 rogue and he sits in the flag room the entire time and prevents the etc from picking the flag up. Really boring.
---
On top of the fact that there are like millions of rogues per server and u only need 1 for a premade and it’s the most boring job in the game. 
---
Rogues are not good in midfights as a good premade will just two shot you the moment you open. 
---
Rogues excell In duels and in world Pvp, but are lacking in bgs.
---
I never downranked any ability, I still FD'd and drank, and I shat on the competition. Don't impose your limitations with the hunter class on me just because your experience was different. God I wish capturing videos back in 2004 was as easy as today so I didn't have to depend on people just taking my word.
---
Main hindrance to this may very well be server queues.
---
they're \*public channels\*
---
what, are you afraid of other people breaking your 'english-dominates-the-world' immersion?
---
I see nothing that clarifies this.
---
I was thinking orc or tauren. I cant figure out which is better though.
---
Either u or I need to visit r/whoosh
---
Quick and simple:
---
Best faction/race to play warrior tank for rapid progression and best faction/race to play mage and shadow priest for PvP/
---
\[laughs in soullink\]
---
I stared at that arm for way too long trying to figure out wtf I was looking at.
---
There is plenty of PvP attacks on PvE servers, hillsbrad back and forth between Tarren Mill and Southshore, for example. The difference is that people can chose if they want to participate or not.
---
And bored level 60s can't make your leveling experience awful in a few months if you play less.
---
 ballpark /played will probably be like 5-6 days or so depending on your interests, play style and class.
---
And just so you know, you still have the same people on the realm regardless because theyll just be waiting in que. So you'll never really know anyone in game because theyll just be changing out constantly. And you'll be stuck in que with everyone. 
---
Why not sharding so we can all play the game at the same time

---
 You don't really gain anything by using swords specifically if you aren't a combat rogue specced unless you are trying to disguise yourself..
---
And since you are doing hemo, I'd perscribe a slow mace for the MH and hemo will be much stronger.
---
I enjoyed your videos very much, subbed :) BTW your voice reminds me of The Backyard Scientist haha
---
You can beat shadow priests and pallys if you do an expose armor in your stunlock rotation.
---
You can kill a warrior by bleed kiting him or stunlocking him with expose armor thrown in. 
---
Everything else I agree with. Rogues can beat any class if they try hard enough.
---
I’d rather have layering instead of queues and dead realms after pop drop off.
---
Was unfortunate enough to pick a dead realm in vanilla. Not fond of transfers, nor merges, especially blizzards merges. Anyone expecting blizzard to truly merge servers is ignoring the fact that blizzard won’t do that.
---
Tricks like...?
---
Just rewatched the announcement just now, and damn it hits me just as hard emotionally now as it did then. 
---
Can't believe we're just over a week away from Blizzard's version of Classic, something many people thought would **never** happen. I'm so ready for this!
---
what language did you just speak
---
I'm in the same boat. As a matter of fact, I can't raid with a lot of my buddies because of my schedule. I'll be looking for early hours /weekend/ west coat raiders.
---
VanasKOS was awesome back then and I think it's beeing updated for retail and classic. I hope it's ready for launch
---
Self inflicted 4 hour queues
---
I want to play both games?
---
Is rather have ques than layering or sharding
---
You can even heal dongeons while leveling as shadow.  So if you're solo leveling you have to go disc/shadow most likely and at lvl 40 get your shadowform (re-spec). 
---
**End game / raids.**  There is usually only 1 shadowpriest per raid.  Priests are usually wanted as healers and it will be easier for you to gear up as a healer and get into raids. 
---
Once more pvp content is released I might go shadow for fun.
---
Was partially due to the people, but Karazhan was the most fun I ever had raiding.  Was in a guild with tons of friends and it was a really fun raid with a small group to progress with.  Also one of the last boss clears was an insane Holy Pally was last person alive killed boss while in bubble (everyone gave the pally the most credit but it was actually my dot that took him down).  Forlorn Harbor RIP.
---
I'm going to disagree with the people here and say hots are able to do an incredible amount of healing if you roll them on multiple people taking sustained damage. 
---
The problem is Vanilla pvp is all about burst damage and killing someone within a few seconds. Once a Resto Druid puts regrowth/ rejuv on the target, they are able to swiftmend once (outside of NS) for burst damage and then the only thing left for them to do is either cast another regrowth (which has a huge mana cost) or spend 3 to 3.5 seconds casting a healing touch, which is likely to get interrupted or the player die before it finishes casting. Spammable 1.5 second cast heals reign supreme in Vanilla pvp.
---
The other big problem is lack of dispel protection. Both Shaman and Priest are able to dispel TWO buffs from the target with one gcd. Warlock Felhunter is able to dispel 1 buff at a time. So if you spend 3.5 seconds putting up a Regrowth + Rejuv on someone, a Priest or Shaman is able to remove both in one gcd.
---
Druids excel at their utility in pvp. Rooting a melee, Faerie Firing all enemy Rogues/Druids, decursing Curse of Tongues off other healers (this is HUGE), abolish poisoning Rogue Blinds + Wound poisons, and throwing hots in between all of the above. And probably the biggest thing they excel at is being the hardest class to kill. With proper positioning and fantastic mobility a Druid is able to easily kite any enemy that decides to try to kill them.
---
The real way to get a wand early: Get skinning and just skin everything while you play the game normally. Eventually you will be able to buy a wand on the AH from the plethora of people who think they are gonna make bank by making wands day 1.
---
Unfortunately no. Deployment /shrug
---
Probably not going to do that. Career &gt; gaming. And it takes up quite a bit of time. I will have a lot of down time with holidays coming up though.
---
Also the term "poop sock" gave me a good chuckle.
---
Lorewise Alliance and Horde are not at war during Vanilla WoW, all the way until late Wotlk and early Cata. Sure, there are two factions, and they're not exactly friendly, but the main point of the game and what it's designed for is tackling pve content, with pvp being fun side content for people who enjoy it.
---
I feel completely reassured :)
---
Only started listening to it a couple of weeks ago. It’s a great change of pace compared to the other WoW podcast I listen to and the guests are awesome.

Haven't seen any game from Red 5 in years. They most likely went bankrupt after their MMO failed.

I'd rather see where these larger realms with more people logged in are going before we hit phase 2.

They've made their choice.
---
Tick eating.
---
Have you ever been in a situation that you have low lv food in ur bags and I just end up selling them or destroying them? I have a solution!
---
Step 1) download an energy bar Adon ( regardless of your class) this will show you the natural tick rate of the server, dots, food ticks, trigger on this timing.
---
Step 2) wait until the bar is full
---
Step3) eat your food and wait till you get one tick of health/mana regen
---
Step4) move while the energy bar is filling up
---
Step5) repeat step 2-4
---
This goes though one food per tick, but it’s a good way to min max your downtime while moving between mobs. When done properly you would be moving at the same speed as your normally would but ur getting small hp or mana increases.
---
They could have done zones I guess, but you’d want to call them neutral zones (like Blasted Lands or Arathi). Still kind of cool I guess, but bosses makes sense to me too.

I’m worried I won’t be able to start my dual boxing on the severe my friends all got names on.
---
Oh right. Going to the Desert?
---
We had(limited) internet when I was in Kosovo 4 years ago:)
---
Oh, no i wasnt. I didnt know that was a thing.
---
Doesn’t matter what we want we are getting the shit on both ends of the stick.

 I  made this cheat sheet to help me grind to 60 on my undead priest to save time and all.  Maybe you guys could use it too. [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/crtalx/horde\_priest\_leveling\_cheat\_sheet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/crtalx/horde_priest_leveling_cheat_sheet/)
---
Play both!
---
I’m maining Hunter for PvP/farming.
---
Will twink my Druid and mage and another Hunter :D
---
Ew.
---
Yep! New reddit sucks!! Old is gold :)
---
They're beasts in PvP, not so much in PvE though. They do pretty mediocre damage and you'll typically see only one per raid for their 15% increased shadow damage debuff (and that's if the leader doesn't decide to bring an Holy or Power / Shadow Weaver priest instead).
---
In phase 2 you'll probably see a lot of preists respec to shadow to run around and melt faces.
---
Early on okay sure you don't have disc traits. Discipline is the best raiding spec once you reach a certain amount of bonus healing because PI is a huge raid dps increase. At this point you can still have PI and 5/5 shadow weaving and your raid as a whole is more efficient.
---
server already full brah. Told ya
---
Much better to just join as a healer then.
---
There’s a video of Ion where he explains everything.
---
Assgape
---
And what happens in a few months? WoW classic will be a novelty for a lot of people. They'll hop in, play for a few weeks, or a few months, and then go back to retail full time. Sure, they could probably fill double the servers they have set up on launch day. But once people start dwindling, we'd have a few servers that might have a healthy population, and a whole bunch of dead servers. Then they'll be stuck merging servers, which feels shitty. 
---
I could be wrong. Maybe the hype will last long term. Maybe half the playerbase will move to Classic fulltime permanently. I just don't see that happening.
---
This was definitely one of the things I remember about Vanilla that most Private servers were never able to provide me.
---
Username my man. Always read the username.
---
You should add the Rune of the Guard Captain trinket from the quest in the Hinterlands, Horde-only.  That is definitely the pre-BiS before farming HoJ.  You should also check out [shadowpanther.net](https://shadowpanther.net) as a great resource for adding to this.

I logged through my Toons while I was testing a Guide-Addon today in Retail and I really didn't found anything to do. I logged on a Level34 Priest because I thought I could level a bit and get a minor bit of Classic Feeling. Then I realized I didn't even have a Slot for my Wand anymore.
---
That was awesome.  Thank you
---
uwu wats this
---
I’ll be listening to a song of ice and fire 🔥
---
But you'd be able to watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy with Herod's queue and still not be logged in
---
You can level full shadow (with 5 points for wand dmg in the Discipline tree) and heal dungeons just fine while you're leveling.
---
Priests are the 4th fastest leveler, behind Hunter, Warlock and Druid. Sure, you kill shit slower, but you never drink so it's constant.
---
It saves about 10 minutes, iirc. The downside is you miss the Loch Modan fp, which you'll have to pick up eventually.
---
Naw, Navy life. 5th fleet. Still hot as balls out here though. Where is Kosovo?
---
lol so similar

---
basically this. Every server will be fucked because of the huge influx of players subbing week of release.
---
I'm playing on launch day and have not subbed to make my character yet
---
Share the code?
---
This will be downvoted by classic die hards but 8.2 isn’t even bad, sure it’s almost an entirely different game but it’s fun for what it is, mythic+ and the new raid are nice time killers.
---
So pick a different server.
---
You’re thinking about it wrong. It is a dichotomy in classic. It is about the gestalt. Thinking about wow as having parts is what gives you retail.
---
I'm glad you took the time to reply. I had heard of this, and I also heard he was kind of a jerk too. But he will always have a place in my heart as a Human Rogue, because he was the first to teach me tricks. 
---
Thanks though I appreciate it!
---
This was a great help for me narrowing down my race/class combos. Great side by side comparisons. Hope someone else finds it useful!
---
Cry about my poor life choices
---
I was. I was there for the stress tests, too. Queue times were pretty short and servers were stable and playable. We'll see what happens on launch day, but I bet that the launch is going to be very smooth.

This makes me think of Menethil Harbor. 🤗

I can't play without Elvui anymore, been using it for years.
---
Firefox
---
In Europe, The Balkans. Near croatia, serbia and greece.
---
It's very messy at the moment. If more people want it i'll clean up in the code then maybe release it
---
No I mean, why would they release them four days apart? It doesn't make sense.
---
Somehow it's more painful now then ever
---
Except they wouldn't bring you into classic, but maybe you can throw them at anyone trying to distract you when you're trying to play.
---
BiS weapon for hunters isn't always a bow.
---
Yeah I'm the same but I can't play alliance at all I've tried !
---
So many people have posted pictures of their characters on “name day” and they’ve got 4 or 5 or 6 people on one server and account. Yeah.
---
Oh my young summer child...
---
ok dude pretend that there aren't too few servers for the incoming zerg. And your Medium server is not going to swell to bursting
---
Per faction, it is always Druid.
---
Least common- Druid by a mile
---
Easiest to get groups in pve- Warrior Tank
---
&gt; bolt thrower
---
I see you're a man of culture
---
sure
---
Druid is least common, but they don’t bring a ton to raids either
---
Still released by crooks and liars, I'll never be able to support literally lying to people's faces to get them to buy your shit game
---
What's your estimated play time per week?
---
That was fuckin great
---
Here's one from Wrash of the Itch King.
---
We were on 25-man Sindragosa and the holy pally in our group was voluntold as tribute to be ice block. JT, the raid leader called out 
---
"Drag, you're the block. get out of the group!" to which Drag responds
---
"I'm good." 
---
A few seconds later and the entire raid was encased in ice.
---
PVP monsters. Some of the scariest pvp players I ever saw were spriests. UD spriests even get a bonus nasty dot in addition to great PVP racials.
---
PvE is not great. Spriests have low damage, high utility. The first spriest in a raid is pretty good, the second one is very bad bc the utility doesn't stack.
---
???? ok? no one asked but go off i guess
---
FYI and easy way to name a target in chat is %T
---
No. They'd have to put in a second animation system for the characters that you can toggle, since the animations are not the same.
---
Also: new models and animations are trash, just like the gameplay of retail.
---
Bouncy, no real weight, round and all over the place.
---
No. We don't need options to make it look more like retail, but less.
---
Blood, shitty glow filter disable etc is what we need.
---
Nah man, he already has bis gear for the next 110 levels
---
Though it depends heavily on what you want from PvP, there's not really an option for "both" in a sense.
---
Sure you can play some BGs on the weekends if you're in the mood, but if you're hoping to actually "gain" anything from PvP you need to hard commit, the higher ranks are not easily obtained.
---
But if you want to casually throw out a couple BGs here and there, go for it, OP. Raiding was/is the primary focus of World of Warcraft. So if you like PvE then you're set.
---
Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people played on PVE servers and had fun.
---
Imagine spending weeks/months grinding quests and EXP, finally getting to 60, only to remember your main city/gathering point is Mudhut Central.
---
If the release a server after launch, it's going to have 99% tourists who only want to play on the server with the smallest queue
---
What’s the scrolls on his shirt say
---
Slight myth to that. By pve I imagine you mean raiding (corrupted modern use of pve).
---
Most Raids have dedicated warrior tanks. Any tank is wanted in dungeons however and druid bears fits that roll easily so druid is in equal demand. Most pick up warriors will more easily fit the dps slot in raids.
---
Stranglethorn Vale would have been top tier
---
Check out this link for a comprehensive answer to your question.

---
Classic WoW census for race, class, server etc. Good watch.
---
Frontstabbing and frontshredding were the products of bad pathing AI on pservers. Mobs would never turn their back on you in Vanilla.
---
You will have a lot of fun!! Just let your dungeon group know that you are a new player, trust me people are willing to take their time to teach you. Have you decided which class you will be playing yet? Feel free to ask questions
---
I hear ret pally is great for pve.
---
tbh this is the only reason why I'm going to visit classic...spend a week with the zerg and the ensuing chaos, with no goal but to do whatever I feel like at the time.  I'll likely be the first wave of tourists quitting once structure and order becomes established
---
Gotcha. Usually internet isnt too bad on the ship, its what is blocked for finding out information that gets tricky. Reddit has been my best friend but isnt always reliable.
---
Alliance travelling to Kalimdor and Plaguelands/SM is really painful though.
---
But some levels below 40, where most classes will be stuck woth 100% ms, will be **a lot** faster for Hunter and druid and maybe even shaman. Doesn't matter the over all leveling speed, classes who get movement boost before 40 are a lot faster during those levels.
---
The point is that a lot of people remember this so it's surprising that they managed to get any fans at all
---
An individual layer isn't going to be 10k, more like 3k or so I believe, unless they've stated otherwise.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Add the 2% hit shoulders from the LBRS quest reward as guaranteed. Superior to cloud drift.
---
Yeah but I think that’s a problem, you cant make a name that’s „better“ than others
---
Slander. Lok’tar Ogar!
---
Until you find that the entrance is camped by the opposing faction
---
True, if he means raids then really any dps, mainly warrior, rogue, or mage.
---
They on some next level shit
---
It depends on what you want from the game. For many people, myself including, I want to feel excited to see the opposite faction out in the world. Can I take this guy? Can he take me? It’s so fun. And how is that weak? Fighting players and mobs makes you strong. Cowering in your safety net with pve enabled is just chicken mode.
---
Says he understands. Still argues the point 😂
---
This is awesome! Thank you!
---
Were you there the full two hours?
---
I agree completely! I love some of the changes in retail toward spell animations and cast animations.. but the classes don't even feel unique anymore. I can vouch for entangling a mob at the last second and skimming away with 5 hp! I love it and it does make sense! Crazy how blizzard went so wrong, so quickly to appeal to the masses.
---
Thank you, we love it!
---
Came to recommend shadowpanther as well. Amazing the site is still up. Very useful.
---
yes they will, at least for as long as layers exist.
---
The basic issue is that server needs scale up exponentially.
---
For a simple example, if I have 5 people around, then I just have to send 5 people's worth of commands to each player(so 25 "commands). If I have 50 people, then I have to send 50 people's worth of commands to 50 players(2500 "commands"). Thats a 100x increase in the number of commands sent out.
---
There are ways to handle this, but a lot of it is more in designing software for these large groups more than just adding computing power.  Eve Online has some good info on this.
---
I guess I could get by with only wolf/cow on orc action.  But with boomkin you get orc on cat/otherkindofcat/bear/seal/owlbeast/cow action.
---
holy shit, didnt know they didnt go with the obvious choice.. this is really important, must be fixed ASAP!!!
---
I’ve been playing for 15 years and I don’t think I’ve seen a female orc running around in the world.... easily the worst character models of them all
---
There's a blue post stating that Herod, Whitemane and Faerlina are likely to experience queues on release. I take that to mean that the other realms will not.
---
perhaps try LEGUME
---
I'd rather have a higher pop cap. 5000 in a single layer is fine with me
---
Classic WoW is by far the best mmorpg to start with.
---

I mean the company was literally falling apart by the time they ousted him, just because you remove the tumor doesnt mean the patient survives.
---
But at the same time, I'm excited to play classic as a "seasoned" WoW player, I was extremely young when I first played WoW and even though I don't have the imagination as I did, I think playing Classic with today's knowledge of the game will feel even more rewarding! I'm hoping.
---
It may play out a little different in classic, but you can bet that if groups discover that strategy works in old AV they will use it. People are lazy and will find the optimal solution eventually.

Come on, you know the score. You're supposed to look like a hobo until level 60. And even at level 60, in BIS gear, you still look like a hobo. You can only look swag if you're willing to take a slight stat hit to wear your full Tier 2.
---
They really messed up a lot of "small-ish" personality things in modern WoW. Things that real WoW players still can't come to terms with.
---
I remember in my Vanilla PvP guild, we used to joke "could you imagine if Horde had Tauren Paladins? Lololol"...
---
**Cataclysm.**
---
2 tanks is worth it
---
There will be plenty of people playing to relax and have fun, but no matter what online game you are playing, there will always be people that are kind of douchey.
---
Can't be helped, but I expect WoW classic will have a much more relaxed atmosphere than most, simply because returning players are chilling out on a wave of nostalgia.
---
Also there is SO MUCH, me personally, did not do in classic AND TBC that I'm looking forward to doing.
---
The two oldest and best are: 
---
wowinterface.com  -  there is a single icon midway down the home page for Classic.
---
curseforge.com  -  select the appropriate version and you’d off
---
I mean....maybe?
---
Or, I went to take a drink of beer while reading this post, exhaled through my nose, and consequently sprayed myself. 
---
Whichever sounds more entertaining.
---
I love destiny 2 and wow all together if you need any one to join up with for any game let me know I have a pretty large wow guild ready to go for classic message me anytime if you want in!
---
They have a limit on the layering bud.
---
Yes. Hacked accounts are part of it, but if you have ever gone to bot forums a lot of them are running bot farms to sell gold.
---
shadow priest..
---
I would like to see the code as well please
---
there is a big difference between having the choice of a fast runner for WSG etc, a fast attack speed for pvp vs casters, and shadow dmg for raids
---
and
---
just fast attack speed or slow.
---
pserver players pretty much all focused on raiding, - and getting lupos was easy there.
---
See here’s the thing with that, if they were releasing WC3 again in a week instead of classic wow, people who want classic wow would be losing their fucking minds because they haven’t delivered it yet. They did classic wow first because that was by far the more vocal group compared to those who wanted WC3 re-done
---
Big mood
---
Alliance - Warlock
---
Horde - Druid
---
I got you, fam.
---
They’ve said all they’re going to say on it
---
You can some crafting stuff. Sapper charges as goblin engineer actually turn a decent profit from converting mats into sappers. But other than that no I don't think there really is.
---
This might just be speculation but it functioned much like weapon proficiency to ensure that the higher your level, the higher chance you had to hit enemies of a higher level with your abilities.
---
It’s gonna be way worse in Classic because they’re using a nerfed AV with weaker elites and shorter archer range.
---
[Tips Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V9FyWhtT5M) did a vid on it if you are interested but yes, the game was made to be more casual friendly.
---
&gt;	plan on leveling as tailoring/skinning or one of the other gathering professions.
---
Are you me? I plan to vendor most of the leather, but as tailoring/skinning you can also make free bags. Less gold wasted on something you require as you level, more gold left for your mount at 40. And everyone else needs bags too. Yes, there will be competition on the AH, but you can make decent coin if you focus on volume.

Yes, illegally.

That he nothing to do with everyone picking the same server.
---
I havent played wow in like, 6 years, lol
---
Reddit is a fragmented representation of wow players.
---
Google alliance levelling routes. In your 30s you will need to grind as quests slow down for us here. There a lot of YouTube videos detailing grind spots. Level with skinning and skin and vendor the leather. Grinding beasts that drop grays and also provide leather via skinning will keep your pockets nice and plush.
---
Any citation?
---
They most certainly do show up. You can swap between Retail and Classic using the up/down arrows by the install path. I've already installed a bunch of mods for Classic. Clique is the one mod I use that shows up on Curseforge but isn't on Twitch, which is odd since the curseforge app is now built into Twitch.
---
that was just a test, we've fine tuned it and it will be ready for release, promise
---
Hello fellow tibian :)
---
Never underestimate the power of neckbeards and shitbuckets.
---
Sorry this project isn't going to take you back to 2004. If layering bothers you wait until it's taken off a server then start.

Ah, excellent.

That looks so insane, who are you sharing your place with?

I still have 'Nam flashbacks from the WoD launch. We actually complained to the BBC and had the issue covered by the show Watchdog. Listening to BBC journalists try to talk about WoW was kind of hilarious. [Video here.](https://youtu.be/A_DtaF8Ky2o)
---
The queue times are just for the login servers. No shit there won't be infinite layers but in theory you won't have to wait for someone to log out before you log in until layering is removed in phase 2.
---
Really cool.
---
No one should be worrying about pvp until battlegrounds anyways.  At least in BG there are some BIS to be earned through PvP.
---
Grown? I can't find any hard data but I thought the general consensus was that it was dying. By all means correct me if I'm wrong.
---
If more layers equal no queue, and they can make as many layers as they want, then there should be no queues on those servers during launch.
---
shaman weap

Fishing! Just toss your line every so often and feel in when you here the splash sound. Cooking is very useful.
---
Damn it Harold!
---
I hope you're right.
---
40 people isn't much
---
Better not go pvp server then, you wait a week to play and even filthy casuals will be ganking you just due to the level difference of waiting.
---
Judgement kinda annoys me because praising it feels so redundant &amp; overplayed.
---
But have me make a list of best looking sets? I will still have to begrudgingly say it's the best
---
GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE
---
Ah gotcha ! I'm trying to decide between dwarf or nelf for my hunter, the waiting around and scoping the situation is something I forgot I do with camo sometimes.
---
Biggest draw for me is drop frost trap, open on pref a clothie, before they get a dot on me, fd, smeld, and let pet beat them up for a while while they slowly crawl over frost trap 😂
---
Back in January when some friends and I decided to get into classic WoW when it came out I did what I normally do when I get into something, I hunt down podcasts. One of the only ones I saw was Countdown to Classic. And when I saw there were already over 60 episodes I knew I had to listen. After listening to an episode, I was hooked. It was a well made and plotted out show, each and every time. It was informative and showed me many things I didn't know about vanilla WoW and gave me the information I needed to try out a Druid when Classic launched. Josh, your podcast was part of the reason I never lost my desire to play Classic Wow over those months. Thank you for every thing you have done for us.
---
I’ve played the 1-20 content for both sides (used to screw around with a trial account when I didn’t have the time for the full game) but for the most part I’ve only played alliance. I’m joining a guild in college that’ll be leveling horde, and I’m excited for the experience.
---
Huntard here, looking to join!  Got a week off from work, and beyond that I work nights so available almost any time other than the occasional lunch date and weekends.  Going on mat leave in november, hopefully, so I'll be no-life for at least 18 months.
---
They keep saying that they WILL get rid of layering before phase 2...you KNOW Herod will have massive queues, it's YOUR problem if you have to suffer through said queues later on, they're not going to keep layering (or, god forbid, add sharding) just to please people too dumb to roll elsewhere.
---
The fault will forever be on the person causing the problem, freedom of speach is not freedom of conseqences, so just dont give people a hard time and the GM wont have to deal with the BS in the first place.
---
They said they are getting rid of it by phase 2.
---
People here think they aren't.
---
I think they have a plan and are gonna stick to it. A mix of layering and adding servers by the time every thing is said and done they hope to have no dead or imbalanced servers, no layering at all, very minimal que times if any.
---
i count barrens as one zone because it is one zone, why u so upset bro? :)

Ah yes the old dragon fucking cars

Why not? Who are you to tell him how to use his money. Grow up. And he's also not pretending anything since he will literally have the mount

heres your citation. Basically its saying that layering wont mean more people can come on the server. They are not increasing server cap even though they have layering. The cap will be the same with or without layering
---
TBC, I was about level 40. Was leveling a feral druid and decided to switch to balance. A higher level player, total stranger, bought an entire set of gear for me to switch to boonkin. All they asked was that I show the same compassion when I was higher level.
