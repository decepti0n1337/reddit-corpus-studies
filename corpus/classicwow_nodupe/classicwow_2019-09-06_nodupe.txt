I usually tip in dungeons and such. Just a silver or two. The mage is saving me a lot more, so why not.

2.6 Legacy League. People found a way to duplicate leaguestones, so while there was an exploit happening, people were blowing it out of proportion.

You guys are acting like they said it's not exploitable. They clearly said it is. If it wasn't they wouldn't be working on a fix. They confirmed it's not as bad as that post yesterday claimed, but they also clearly said it is being exploited and called it an exploit themselves. I mean you could hop on twitch and find a streamer abusing layers blatantly. Even the "big" worldcraft streamers were blatantly doing it
---
Or it tells you how little you know

Check the official blizz forums for that realm.

You really think someone would do that?

Hahahaha. Novad is one of my mates . Sorry OP

I believe Blizzard is still working on the details for when the free server option will come online and which realms will be eligible to transfer from/to.

I imagine we should be hearing more details withing a week or two.

Third year pharmacy school student here...... classic could not have released at a worse time. I have an exam per week and my desire to study is at an all-time low.

Wanted to use it but damn it does sound game breaking Blizzard should ban it or ppl with it will have nice advantage
---
recommend me a class for world pvp, dueling, and battlegrounds?
---
So far I'm thinking of druid or priest the most, and third would be shaman. open to anything other than rogue.
---
Warrior chiming in i bet
---
Is there layering in Capital cities? I brought my friend who never played the game before to Ironforge and was building it up all the people that would be there.
---
But then there were like 5  people in front of the bank and that was it. It was such a let down.
---
Google says Arabic
---
Shrugs at you. Who knows?
---
Those actually cost to make though
---
Correct, you can set paging on any of the bars in options. Based on stances, forms, stealth ect.
---
Unless you take 1v1's very seriously, it doesn't matter. In world pvp in or bg's, kills are still going to come easy to you regardless of your race, and once the Honor system, that along with how much time you have to play are the only things that really matter.
---
It can, yeah, but it'll usually be faster and less mana intensive to just melee a couple times.
---
Worst case: buy transfer back to Gehennas later if Earthshaker dies.

Try playing a mage.   I'll give you a taste.

I believe them 75% on this. I bet they're not sharing the most extreme cases they've observed and I bet there are a few insane ones.
---
Yes with dual wield and swords, the white damage adds up quick plus the attk speed is engaging?
---
Also, 3-5 CP eviscerate costs too much in energy and most mobs are low hp by then and 1-3 CP evis doesn't do much damage. 
---
Best of all, SnD doesn't cost much to maintain so you are free to use gouge in emergencies to first aid/use pots plus if you ever fight 2+ mobs you don't lose the CP since when you switch targets (it can go to SnD)

Its pretty out of the way for Alliance lol

&gt; My combat log doesn't automatically alert me to the name, level, class, and coordinates of an enemy player, and if they've entered stealth or not the instant they do something within sight range
---
The addon doesn't do this either. There's nothing in the addon API to track the coordinates of another player. By the way, your combat log DOES alert you when someone enters stealth. You just aren't paying attention to it.
---
So they are 60 aswell when you hit 60. If you think just being a 60 warrior is enough i got really bad news for you.

*Blink 182 intensifies*

It would be absurdly difficult to abuse that on a 60 min hearthstone timer. You'd find crafting mats faster yourself than by hearthing/finding a rested zone, then getting summoned by 3 people on a layer to a node that they could've collected themselves.
---
Absolutely no benefit to that.
---
You also realize that it costs money to train Conjure food/water, it's a staple money maker for mages in classic. In groups/instances sure give it up for free, sitting on a zepplin w/e, otherwise I expect to get paid
---
I don’t know.  It has waypoints and arrows that work I guess.
---

Yeah I am playing mage and rogue. Tbh most people give me tip without me saying "hey can you pay?" When you just give it to them it usually ends with $$$ coming your way.
---
Oh lawdy
---
I think you’re touching on what I would like to see. Will likely never happen, but I would love to see the game expanded in a way that keeps all of the core characteristics intact. Strictly. Don’t make green items better than the epics you just earned. Instead require some decent gear to even step foot into the expanded content area. Make it feel like more content without feeling like a restart. BC felt like a restart. At any rate, no rush on any of this. Still got a lot of play left in Classic.
---
bullshit that warlocks get a wizard hat AND a mount for free
---
Wait until you find out about the network superadmin working in the sub-basement.
---
Dungeons aren’t layered, so that’s not an issue unless you can’t get to the entrance on your own, but also they said multiple layer changes. like the first or second probably won’t be bad. It will probably only get bad if you abuse it.

I guess the average older player doesn't hang out on reddit that much? I'm in my 30s and trying wow for the first time with wow classic.

I like melee classes that use weapons like swords, axes etc.. It seems like in Vanilla the only choice I really have is either Warrior, Rogue, Paladin and Shaman. However, I'm not a huge fan of the healing aspect (which Paladins/Shamans have to do late game) and I'm not a big fan of being super squishy and stealthy (rogue) so I think I will roll the Warrior. The only downside is how much everyone's raving about how hard it is to level up and as someone who doesn't have any friends to play with (i played WoW back in 2004 when I was like 12 years old) idk how much I will enjoy it. Will Paladins get better DPS wise as the phases come out (if so I want to run a Paladin)
---

---
**Nice**
---
you’ll regret it when you’re 40 lol. just vendor everything if they’re not guildies, and AH blues
---
For random requests outside of groups and raids, ABSOLUTELY. (Which believe it or not does happen fairly often but not alot , especially late game)
---
I do find it hard to form an opinion on the subject though, if someone isnt or hasnt played the classes in question.
---
 Until you're actually in said situation, dealing with peoples requests regularly and can speak from experience one way or the other, I really dont understand why someone would comment on the matter.
---
This kills the classic wow =(
---
To be honest private servers felt closer to real vanilla than what we have now unfortunately. Layers, addons, knowledge, attitude, and pacing and now realm transfers are all out of whack in current classic wow.  Dont get me wrong I like playing but it's all different again as in vanilla is different from private servers and classic is different from both. 3 versions of the game all fun but come with their own drawbacks.
---
If someone pulled that on me I would just say GL finding a new tank and hearth out and make my own group, likely with the 3 other members who didn't get pissy
---
I don't believe so because whenever my husband plays and would invite me to group I would always change layers to his.
---
And sorry to all the mages/warlocks/priests out there, but despite being “able” to wear leather/mail/plate, most of the good healing gear is cloth. If I’m healing, I’m rolling on healing gear.
---
Also for when at work: try putting the URL into google and clicking the down arrow next to the link to view the cache. Most interactive features don't work like this but if you're just reading it usually works. Even works on government computers for most sites. Also sometimes works to ensure you're using https version in case the proxy blocks all non-secure sites.
---
Debatable. Drain tank is what all the cool kids are doing now, and spirit is pretty much useless for it.
---
That shaman comment hits right at home.
---
I feel like that is a trigger to fight. I've done that a couple of times and they become unsapped -pause  - then proceed to fight. As if sap was another way for saying "let's punch on"
---
Agreed. This is why i always picked a server on retail based on how many guilds could do full end game
---
Nice
---
No
---
the bigger concern is it being not populated enough - I think it is the right move if you don't want any more queues.
---
To be fair there was a bug with NPCs disappearing in certain layers. I came across it a few times and had to beg for an invite to a layer that had them.

[removed]
---
I had my reservations when my friends suggested it but its been great so far!
---
Warriors are top tier for PvP what are you talking about? Get good.
---
Had the same problem as Forsaken, there are a few entry quests in Bloodhoof Village that unlock other quests. Hope that helps!
---
I don't understand what the big deal is even if people are abusing it. I don't personally bother layer swaping because I don't see the point, on Arugal(highest pop OCE server) changing layers just means swapping from one overpopulated zone to another overpopulated zone. Sometimes causing you to gather fewer mats/per hour than the one you left.
---
Also, there are so many reasons why a player might be at a disadvantage when it comes to farming. Why is the player base concerned with this one specifically? Sure, I could layer swap and *maybe* I might see a slight increase in herbs/ore gathered per hour. But let's say I worked nights instead of days and therefore could spend my time playing WoW outside of peak times; I would then see a far larger increase in resources farmed per hour. You can also make the same comparison between a player who spends 1 - 2 hours a day playing and player than spends 8+. I could do all the layer swapping I want but if I'm playing for 1/4 of the time of someone else then that person is going to get ahead regardless.
---
Layering seems pretty low down on the list of things that cause player wealth inequality, especially since they have said layers will be reduced or in some cases removed as server populations stabilize. Is everyone that is taking issue with layer swapping used to being part of the top 1% or something? Because as a regular middle of the pack player it's not exactly new for me to see players outpace me in terms of accumulating resources. Layer abuse might stretch that gap a little more but honestly, it doesn't affect me in the slightest.
---
Or take up Engineering
---
How often do people walk up to askimg for buffs outside of dungeon groups? Not to sound rude, but it really is constant for mages. And considering that it has a long cast time. (Water/food creation) thats where the tip demand is coming from. Honestly it's just tradition at this point but there's the logic.
---
Also warriors have WW axe which is better anyway.
---
My friend is A shadowpriest main. He doesn’t care what anyone else thinks.
---
Ask the next one?

 /petattack
---
Get some binds...
---
&gt;You realise, 10 runs 37% drop chance, statistically I'd see it 4 times, or 3.
---
Yes, that is indeed how statistics work.
---
&gt;In actual fact I saw it 5 times and lost the roll 4 times. ( first time I had agreed to pass so I could join at 27 and complete warrior quest)
---
Ok? I mean, this is the height of anecdotal personal experience that has no real impact. You could easily make a group where you are the only one who needs it. Or you could win the roll first time. etc.
---
Statistically, as you like to mention, it should in fact be very easy for you to get it. You could easy get it in half an hour or so doing resets after the corpsemaker buffs and/or do a set group where you repeat until people have the wep.
---
&gt;It's not boring because of the gameplay, it's boring because it leaves out a lot of people and creates a negative meta for people wanting to run SM.
---
This is incredibly silly, and a complete strawman.
---
That's like saying guilds are boring because they leave out a lot of people because you are most likely to play with guild mates.
---
Nobody is inherently entitled to be in your group. If you want to make a 5 druid group or an all druid raid for a boss you can do so. It isn't some great detriment because you're denying people access to your all druid party.
---
&gt;creates a negative meta for people wanting to run SM
---
That's a very subjective and completely personal opinion. And also implies negative things that simply don't have to exist.
---
Warrior is a popular class. Warrior levelling is rough. Warrior levelling in dungeons is not. Thus warriors want to do dungeons, and this is a way to get warriors in groups easily in the numbers that there are.
---
There is nothing stopping other classes getting groups as they always would. Especially likeminded people who don't care for speed or efficiency and would rather trundle through a dungeon, like yourself.
---
As an aside, since you seem to be talking about speed:
---
&gt;Did basically the same with the warrior axe quest. Albeit I was lvl 33, but I got 16 bars of experience to farm those 30 tusks..
---
That's what you yourself said. And thats JUST for the tusk part.
---
That time alone you could've levelled most of the way from corpsemaker to ravager in a dungeon.
---
Paladins would be struggling to kill them anyways.
---
Okay glad to have confirmation my 3 days, 9 hours, and 16 minutes to 34.5 is only shit not colossally shit.
---
Bruh my orc warlock had u dies and a vest on until lvl 25  just looked like a homeless man for most of my lvling
---
But people were waiting like 10+ hrs to get through those queues, so half turnover seems right to me?
---
yesterday like +300 Gold.
---
Glory to bigglesworth!
---
Yeah right now Grobbulus is packed full of people who aren't following the RP rules. I was forgiving at first, but at this point I've probably reported over 50 people. So far I haven't witnessed an ounce of RP.
---
Quick reminder that - at least in Europe - the RP realm was the only one without a queue. And, coming from an RP realm back in vanilla, there are a **lot** of people who will go out of their way to annoy/irritate RPers. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the Goldshire people (also the diverse animal genitalia cast) were not all RP realm residents...
---
If the servers don't shit themselves at least twice it won't be a true AQ gate opening event :]
---
I don't mind, they can keep removing them. The realm doesn't feel dead either way to be honest and I really feel like the layering did a good job at what it was suppose to do.
---
yet he still has that fake picture on his twitter.
---
To say nothing of the bag slot(s) those runes occupy in order for said mage to be able to open a portal that is only useful to other players.
---
I did it. https://imgur.com/a/Cr2ZV1G
---
I use the mouse wheel, forward for attack and backwards to follow. Makes it easy to send it out to pull aggro or pull it back if it's close to death
---
So aoe grinding cant work any better than speccing single target grinding when considering realistic circumstances. Thats the whole point.
---
I played since day 2 2004, hit HWL in vanilla, top rank in arena, played every spec possible. Ive tried aoe like everyone else, its only good if you have zero competition, which exists nowhere now without layer exploiting
---
Blizzard claimed duping wasn't possible in the past.
---
I'd take this statement with a grain of salt.
---
Cringe.

How do you even die to PVE on a priest, serious question.
---
I haven't played retail for 7 years. I've been on private servers. 
---
I've already blacklisted 4 players from my groups because they were spazs
---
People want to play with me, not the other way around lmao
---
Are u referring to the time he said ding in general? I was in tedrassil questing at that time haha
---
Yeah I thought so! Small world mate. Had many a lectures there, a few years yonder now!
---
You'd be fighting over Anduin's scraps with Topper McNabb.
---
ok enjoy getting your mount at 50
---
What's on the right is an updated belf model that hit in legion iirc - with an eyes/face option that came in bfa. It isn't exactly 15 years but close enough that i didn't want to do the math. ;)
---
&gt; Anytime they see me they ask for a buff. Most of the time I just do it preemptively because its not a big deal.
---
&gt; The cast time is 3 seconds. It is not inconvenient
---
So what buff are you casting? Because it sure isn't a blessing of anything since they are all instants.
---
BUT THEY DO FLIPS
---
- Better knowledge of the game
---
- Lots of practice
---
- Lots of playtime condensed into a week
---
 - OP says 7 days and 10 minutes time to 60, or about 168 hours in about 11 days. If he only played 2 hours a day like many people do it would have taken him 84 days or just shy of 3 months.
---
He said missing with 2h penalizes you much more than DW. He’s right. The guides can say whatever they want. Simple fact that you need rage to kill things, and 2h generates way too slowly. You might miss more as DW, but you’ll kill far faster and have more than enough rage to spare. This is applicable up until 40. From there, mortal strike probably takes the cake.
---
Speaking as someone who's first 60 in vanilla was a hunter -- boo hoo.
---
Yeah, I started vendoring higher value stuff like weapons and sending the cheaper stuff to a bank alt for future disenchanting.
---
In b4 parry block miss.
---
No effort re posts of "haha queue"
---
12 year olds gotta learn the hard way lol!
---
Should be a fun league. Looking forward to it personally.
---
what's next, they're going to go after your "Twogenders" character as well?
---
The cast time is irrelevant.
---
1 BoW means they dont need to drink for 5 minutes. How much silver is that worth?
---
1 BoM means the rogue kills faster so he doesnt need to heal as much and gets to the next mob faster and level faster.
---
Never have I been tipped. Never do I expect one.
---
Grob Mob!
---
Blizzard is going to disable cross layer chat if people don’t stop abusing this
---
There is none right now
---
After going through leveling a fury warrior in vanilla, I always stop to help a warrior on a quest finish his quest
---
Heh. it's their client running on your machine.  it can do whatever they tell it do. Stop thinking of everything server side.  You compromised your machine the minute you started it up.
---
Your name was reported multiple times by other players, this suspension is an automatic action and was not done by a human. You can appeal.
---
This has nothing to do with the naming policy.
---
Hey don't pick on my autocorrect ok?
---
Love that video. As much as I love horde I feel like between Onyxia and dusk wood alliance got some really great quests
---
Playing Alliance first time in Classic  and found out that Alliance don't have Flight paths in Badlands, STV and Swamp of sorrows compared to the Horde...really tilts me.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d099s3/what_faction_should_i_go/). 
---
Not while leveling.
---
Nah. They downvoted you because you were also making assumptions but giving them as though you were absolutely correct, then Blizz came out and proved the other guy completely correct. That's how it didn't age well.
---
Nah, it took ~2 hours for 8kish on Stalagg.
---
Bat's are seriously underrated as pets. Aoe threat from screech, more survivability from said screech, and normally a pretty fast attack speed to boot.
---
Are there any cool mix-specs for druid or is it best to just pick one and go for it?
---
Yes
---
Classic wasn't really nice to paladins, they heal rather decently but there are few that can really kick up the damage, they got way better around BC.
---
Also one of the reasons there is rarely anything else then heal palas in raids.
---
Leave the fricken cows alone man 🤣
---
what faction should i go???
---
for the........?
---
This exact thing happened in 2005-2006 as well. in 2006 blizz opened up dozens of servers to accommodate the thousands of players swarming to play the game. when they opened those servers they offered free xfers to the newly created servers because the OG servers had constant queues. I actually think the queues back then where worse.  
---
The only difference is that the xfer system is more polished, streamlined and fully automated. the old system was a request system, semi-automated, and web-browser based that could take 24 hours or sometimes even longer to complete. None of which affects gameplay.
---
I mean we did stop the aspect is death itself, so we're not *all* bad. But it's definitely more of a Punisher the situation than a Spiderman.
---
Yeah, you would think the actual process of "leveling up" would be a system of the retail client, not the classic data.
---
Alliance have always been PvP averse since vanilla whereas every Horde player I've met on classic so far enjoys it.
---
Well then you won't have any dots on you to pull you out of freezing trap when I feign trap you!
---
Wow, what a bunch a cry babies, he won get over it..
---
Lol don't spread your stupidity around man Haha Haha! You are a joke. You live in a country that was forged under Christians values and in the western society that was entirely built by christianity!!
---
Same Storm from K3?
---
You were wrong then and now.
---
I believe this response from Blizz is another case of "you think you do, but you don't." I've been playing with a friend who takes every opportunity he can to abuse this laying system and it's very effective. We've been able to get named mobs that weren't spawned on our layer and avoid PvP situations that weren't in our favor. It's easy to do and works practically every time. This is a real issue, despite what blizzard is telling us.
---
As for ruining the economy, have a listen to the latest episode of Countdown To Classic podcast where they address laying, it's real and it's happening. Why anyone would trust blizzard to know how to handle this or to understand how a game system could ruin the game experience is beyond me.
---
Thanks! I hate it!
---
Aww cute its a bald midget
---
people will remember you at 60. don’t worry🤪
---
For everything. Hence the specify otherwise part. That's how it had always been and how it will always be. You roll for your role, unless you say otherwise to start with.
---
&gt; wingclip and walk away
---
Why would you Wing Clip while he's Frozen? That's a good way to eat a Hamstring before you can get away.
---
The best healer I've played with was shadow spec. This was from lvl 20 to 30
---
I have been that the title is false.  Unwilling and unable are different.  additionally, they don't have to win - they just have to make it expensive enough that people will stop trying. there's a huge difference. 
---
There is a huge amount of investment int he "they can not"  but somehow the argument has morphed into "they will not"  
---
But that's not the counterpoint.  It's almost like the argument shifted because you all are so invested in the "can not" and have conflated the two issues. 
---
Again - it's their execution environment.  They could simply disable any add on that they don't vet and distribute themselves  much like the app store do.    Or just turn off the execution environment completely.    
---
Not that they will.  But they COULD.  and that is my entire point.    ther eis a huge different between would and could.  but the OP posted about COULD.  and they CAN.
---
You know, I used to play a rogue and had a friend who played a lock and I always loved helping him out with his quests. The epic warlock mount quest was amazing.
---
It's so awesome to be able to live in the game I loved so many years ago again. I don't care if they continue relaunching the expansions, as long as they don't bring out Cata again *shudder*
---
He wasn't really tanking per se- and neither would you in this situation.  If you're only doing one pull at a time it's possible to hold aggro at least for awhile.  But once the mobs get to maybe half HP someone will pull threat.  Plus if you have three mages AOEing you might as well pull 2x or 4x as many packs (within reason). 
---
The strength of a paladin is plate armor+shield, and helping 'gather' mobs into tighter packs while sustaining the hits.  I watched some of that stream.  Esfand took a bunch of abuse getting mobs into a tighter shape and held minimal aggro with consecration.  Then once the mages frost nova'd he GTFO'd and healed the rest of the pull.  It was a good use of class abilities, because otherwise he would just die from having way too many mobs hitting him
---
You can only migrate to another specific realm. You can't pick where you want to go, unfortunately :(
---
You can't have names that reflect known public figures, past or present. It's been a rule since forever... although it's well known that people do such as thing in form of puns and the like.
---
I once got flagged for having a priest name "Saintpeter".
---
Haha, I'm Alliance so it makes sense I can't get the Horde quests. Thank you though!
---
How much did you make, OP?
---
As the guy who does the quick and easy dungeon runs  and who you want to tank for you.
---
I've already got a guild to help me
---
Strafing you still have to turn slightly towards the target, so it's not *quite* as effective as doing the jump shot well.
---
You on an RP realm?  Because that would be against the naming policy:
---
**Names that reference well known people, characters, brands, places, or icons (For example: Britneyspears, Austinpowers, Mcdonalds, Georgewashington, Newyork)**
---
[Source](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/135764)
---
Didn't do ony. Haven't done every single quest, I haven't even done Rfd. I love Rfd. Our professions arent that good, most of us in greens so we have sets to get. Personally I want AGM. There's loads to do other than raiding.
---
Will I learn to Tackle and Grapple? Like an ultimate fighting pro?
---
[https://youtu.be/6HhCajvimEw](https://youtu.be/6HhCajvimEw)
---
What level can you tank RFK? Anyone know?
---
Would "older" work better?
---
Ret pallys are not good dps. If you want to play a warrior do it. Don’t listen to all the haters. I levelled at 14 to 60 and raided. You’ll be fine.
---
Here you go:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d06gzu/blue_post_about_layering_issues/

Looks like you were 100% incorrect, im so surprised.
---
So what does it scale with?
---
AFAIK there is no publicly accessible data on this yet.
---
Alliance!
---
I wish the servers were a little smaller like they used to be. Even with layering, the mob competition is crazy
---
I have the option too now, but there is a server "Sulfuras" not "Arcanite Reaper" when I try to transfer my character.
---
&gt; 20 something no-lifers
---
hey now
---
They aren't bound by the rules, they can do whatever the fuck they want, "how are they allowed", who is going to stop them? Call the cops! For an obvious troll they sure got you good.
---
Don't forget to thank the Embalmer for this glorious gift.
---
Layering doesn't break the economy.  The economy in MMOs is based on items that respawn indefinitely.  You can farm *forever*.
---
That's my roll!
---
&gt; The cast time is irrelevant.
---
&gt; 1 BoW means they dont need to drink for 5 minutes. How much silver is that worth?
---
For a mage that BoW isn't worth 5 minutes of actual casting. Maybe 5 mins if they are trying to conserve mana. Your level 60 version only regens 33 mana every 5 seconds which don't even regen enough mana to offset a rank 1 fireball spam.
---
👍👍
---
Is that actually true or meme?
---
Impressive
---
I am a frost mage. What is better? 19 frost damage OR (11 int, 7 stam, and 12 spirit)?
---
I gave a guy 200 level 35 water and he gave me 5 fucking gold. 5.
---
I've heard from a few different sources that ret paladin may be the only thing worse to level than a warrior. Your raid rotation also consists of: auto-attacking and buffing allies. You might do judgements, not sure. Ret paladin also suffer from the "hybrid tax" where you do less dps because you provide utility and healing.
---
If you don't want to take advantage of the positives of being a hybrid, you're only left with the negatives. Sounds like warrior may be a better pick for you. You could consider feral druid (similar hybrid tax problems) but you won't be seeing your weapons.
---
The shamans in my group needed and won all the cloth drops, I was healing on my priest. So that doesn’t always work
---
If you're interested in dungeons tanks are in super high demand
---
The beauty about classic is when those guys try to find a group just spread the gospel about how big of assholes they are.  Might not seem like a big deal now but when everyone is running instances at 60, it’s easy for assholes to get their come uppance
---
This may not necessarily be untrue. Keep in mind, even when they ended ps2 support, they still have to design and make the game with ps2 devkits. That is probably how their servers are designed too.
---
Please this.
---
If haven’t had retail installed since classic was announced.
---
In the Dev AMA they did mention the possibility of expansions like BC and Wrath, but in the spirit of vanilla. So no dungeon finder in wrath, stuff like that.
---
It was said here, in english.
---
i get the point but its hard to compare hard game mechanics with addons that are giving people advantages its like if that was the argument about aimbot or wallhacks in a fps
---
It doesn't need to be ingame
---
Just admit you took the bait and were wrong. Jesus, it's not hard to admit you were wrong.
---
Believe they start at level 40, and go up till 45 ish. Theres a big camp of 40-43, then a separate camp of 44+.
---
I have a dedicated sticky note on my desktop..... but its empty because noone has even tried to kill me yet... idk why, but hey, empty list is great for me.
---
This is what I love about classic. I stick around to help people finish quests too, because I'd like it if they did the same for me and I want to pay it forward. I've met so many cool people so far just questing through classic and having all these questing adventures where we were in it together and I just love it. 
---
I don't diss retail as a general rule, but you really wouldn't get this on retail because the gameplay just doesn't necessitate it. On classic, everyone helps everyone else out. You see someone coming to do the same quest as you? You invite them. You do the follow up together if there is one. It's so friendly and nice. I'm only level 29 but it's been so lovely so far. I've never felt so in love with WoW in years. I've never felt more excited to log into the game. It really is insane.
---
Alliance have been extremely scummy on my server. Let me share this classic tale for you too.
---
I am level 30 and wanted to complete my Brutal quests for more armor. I was in the wetlands to hunt the Dragonmaw Clans and take their shin bones for the Brutal Legplates.
---
I ignored any Alliance player who was much lower than myself. If their name was not yellow I would not even acknowledge them. I ran by and did nothing.
---
Soon I found myself an opponent, a hunter level 27, and I wanted to flex my new Corpsemaker on him. He was eating and restoring his health. A kill on an enemy who is unprepared is worth no honor. I waited for my opponent to finish his meal and acknowledge me.
---
I bowed before the night elf and let out a /roar before charging into battle with him. He did not stand a chance without catching me unawares and I quickly finished him up.
---
I knelt beside his corpse and said a prayer, waited for him to respawn, and bow again to show I had a good time. I turned my back to run away and leave him be. 
---
NOOOOOOOOPE MOTHER PIECE OF GARBAGE ALLIANCE SCUM JERK FACE TRASH EATING HATS!
---
A rogoues knife was in my back, a druid entangled me, a warrior charged me, and all hell breaks loose. Worthless curr all of them fighting a 5v1.
---
I respawned, bowed again out of respect and understanding this was their turf, turned to leave, got corpse camped twice more before they had finally left me alone to hearth home.
---
You have to make a choice, quality audio or quality microphone. If you want both you have to buy separate peripherals
---
Before this sub blew up we weren't complaining about blizzard at all. We were just worried that what they say may not be what they actually do. If they stand true to their word (and it looks like they are arguing in good faith) everything is fine
---
I want to second what this guy said, I'm currently leveling my third time as a prot warrior, I feel like people exaggerate the difficulty a bit. Warrior has always been my main so maybe my perspective is skewed.
---
The body grows old the personality doesn’t change as much.
---
The way I was able to do it was I clicked on portrait then selected change character. I logged in and logged out (because people said that's what made it available), but that didn't do anything. So in the filter/search for characters I typed in my classic characters name and then it showed up.
---
The only right answer is Horde, Alliance scum. 
---
See you in the fields of battle!
---
Lvl 35 lock here. Same for me I out dmg every consistently partly because locks have great health and mana sustain so normally mages will have to stop or lower their dmg to conserve mana.
---
Mist babies who never played classic
---
Yeah.  It make me LOL at work.  GO the bouncy gnomes!
---
But I wasnt trolling. I was casually questing not talking to anyone. Why are you just assuming things
---
Throwing away a level 42 character to roll the exact same class with different racials sounds like crazy talk to me.
---
Read the blue post, you fringgin' drama queens.
---
Darkest dungeon vibe to it
---
The correct way to check for holding both modifiers at once is [mod:altshift]. I think your way may work too but I don't know if it is causing your problem.
---
Just want to say, as a mage I bless every mama users I run by with intellect. I’ll even open up a trade and drop a stack of water if I see one out solo questing. Not all mages are how you say. Now quit your complaining or I’ll turn you into a sheep 🙂👍
---
Take all my money! All of it!!!
---
Hilarious! I did something very similar yesterday. Guy in /y in the SM lobby spamming "stack of lvl 25 water 10s". Stood right next to him and started spamming "free lvl 35 water". I got quite the angry whisper. Lmao.
---
The lyric is actually inverse... "what you eat, dont make me shit"
---
Spyware is all client-side, assuming the C2 never reaches a server. You're irrelevant to this conversation.
---
Yeah I’ve been making bank off of the thundering charms. Like 6-7 gold but still
---
&gt; and I didn't upgrade or buy any skills from 30-40 at all
---
You actually cutting exp gain by half doing that.
---
as a Human I cleared the abby (hit level 6, trained in goldshire) and then went immediately to Teldrassil.   and arriving in Shadowglen all of the quests were still green.   Did every quest and stayed through Teldrassil, darkshore, ashenvale, stonetalon.   
---
 (before darkshore I quickly cleared the end of elwynn and dunmorough for an extra 3 level boost before going to do darkshore,  also because as Warlock I had to get training in Goldshire/SW still since Nelfs dont have Warlock trainers, so I left hearth in Goldshire, hearthed home at end of teldrassil, then after elwynn i moved hearth to ironforge).
---
In this way you can very smoothly do all nelf quests for full rep as any race you want to.  I imagine you can easily do the same for any cross race situation  (certainly even easier on horde side)
---
Can someone remind me of this in approximatively 16 hours? I really want to get the same UI but i'm going to forget this post if i just save it.
---
Got my brown one last night :)

This isn't even ERP though. These people are just messing around cuz they rolled on an RP server but don't RP

Cool

Looks great
---
I'm so pissed at how many warriors there are.
---
All I saw online was constant complaining of how hard warrior was to level in classic and how no one wanted to do it again.
---
But its actually the most played? Pft.
---
&gt; they can do whatever the fuck they want
---
You're missing the point. How would you feel if you were forced to change your character's name because of some brats?
---
Im having mostly fun playing the game but its just whenever I team up with others I see that they do much more than me. Both dmg and tanking etc and most of the time i team up with people same levelrange as me +\- 3 levels. 
---
Will definetely try to find a good wand. Shadowbalt is very meh. Not enough damage for manacost and cast time. 
---
And thanks! Will keep everything you said in mind:-)
---
Good, those things suck anyway
---
Luckily my team has De’Aaron Fox the goat 🐐
---
Isn't that just instancing?
---
They couldn't find Kazzak?
---
I find it odd you jump straight to raids when only an extremely insignificant portion of the player base is at that level right now. Are you basically saying that you must 100% adhere to the most min maxed cookie-cutter build to play ANY type of group content? Like if you want to run SM you have 0 room to play around, and must use whatever build someone else has decided is best for you? If that's the case then I think you are the type of person that takes away a lot of the charm and enjoyment people find in a game like classic wow. Above all else classic differs from retail in focusing on the role playing aspects of the MMO genre, whereas retail is the ultra stream lined mess of number crunching content I think may be more in line with your play style. Take talents for example, a big issue people have with retail is the dumbed down talent tree, right? Well with your "Don't come into my RFC unless you are an absolute slave to the meta" mindset, you basically boil down classic talents into a retail equivlant where you just have to click more than 5 talents. 
---
There's a lot more that I feel is wrong with your comment and general personality, but I really don't want to invest the effort into deconstructing it when I'm so close to 40, so I'll leave you with this: think very hard about whether or not classic is the right kind of game for you, as it sounds like you really don't have the patience or personality to enjoy it.
---
That's just a warlock with extra steps
---
Gosh I left this server to play with a friend on a PVE one.. Regretting it more everyday that passes
---
Ha-hah! Glaaad I could help!
---
Is there another way to manage my addons besides twitch? Twitch comes with way too much other “bloatwear” stuff and other kinds of stuff that I don’t want on my computer.  All that stuff that pops up when you start twitch is a waste of bandwidth and pc resources.
---
Mages can make a 20 stack of hybrid cheaper than you can buy from a vendor. 
---
Unless you farm meat, fish and cook or can heal, it’s cheaper to to pay a Mage.
---
Don't need to do that, just make a quick check whenever you are invited to a group, if you are not within a certain distance, you won't switch layers. Can slightly complicate it by repeating the check every couple minutes against your party leader's coordinates, if it succeeds you switch to his layer. They already have your coordinates on the map, no need to maintain anything extra. It's not really any different from checking you are in the same zone which is how it works in BFA.
---
It's more inconvenient isn't it since you have to search for it and then go to your mail after too instead of just going to a general good vendor.
---

On real server the Shadowglen quests only netted about 2.5k rep. (as a human even)   about half as much as private servers gave.   Still thats a lot.   Also there doesnt seem to be any Cascaded rep from other major city quests.  thats another feature that was added in tbc
---
it can, and its not a wrong to play the game, but it is inherently against everything that a mmorpg stands for still, that is multiboxing of course.
---
You're meant to Quive people with it. Duh...

Buying twink items early game could work out because most expect their price to increase later on. IMO (and this is just a guess) twinking won't be as big in classic as it was in vanilla tho so prices may not go super high.
---
Yeah fuck that guy: I can understand and sympathize with people trying to make some cash from their professions but anybody who is charging money for a couple clicks of a button deserve to be dicked over like that. 
---
That's like a priest trying to charge for a Fort Buff.
---
They will not.  They will see you in guild.  Not sure if they add your character to their friends list.
---
They won't see you online through your real id but they can see your individual character if they have that specific character added.
---
If no other suggestions are working out for you, you could always make your own with WeakAuras. Just make one that shows the spell icon when triggered by the application of your DOT spell and put it under the target frame scaled to the size you want it with the duration timer integrated with the icon.

I couldn't find a recursive version that works I installed the twitch alpp to help me only for that and it still gives me a fatal error. Could you link a working recursive version?
---
Why?
---
You showed jim good.
---
In raids you just frost bolt for the fire raids (first 2) then you get fun game play with fire spec. Some fights you might be to decurse people.
---
Yes you are correct. I missed read op and thought we were talking about leveling.
---
So, a guildie of mine is layer-hopping like crazy. He showed me how he does it. He mines/herbs an entire route in a zone, right to the edge of a zone, enters the other zone, then use some kind of LFG tool or /who to find people in the zone he wants to go in to. Once he invites 1 person into his group from the zone he is just on the edge of, but stepped out of, he immediately passes them lead, then with them having lead, he steps into the zone.
---
He sees if there is a resource respawn and if there is, he knows that he layer hopped and he continues to mine/herb like mad.
---
Resource hopping is a very real thing and being exploited.
---
I am not sure tbh. I don’t know is curse forge or what ever it’s called works with vanilla.  Here is a link to it from [curse forge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime) 
---
Download the addon and then find some comparable guides to install into it as well. I have been using tugs which has gotten me to level 27.5 in about 16 hours played with some of it being afk time.
---
oof
---
More than likely. I’ve been there (Oculus) and I have to say it’s really cool standing right there and feeling really tiny.
---
Yup.  Your server is where you'll make friends and memories.  You will never play WoW Classic with all of your RL friends, and that's fine.
---
Retail WoW has cross-realm play where you can group with anyone  if you like WoW but desire that functionality.
---
So, if I added someone as a friend on Battle.net, they wouldn't be able to see me online unless they also directly added my character to the in game friends list?
---
You guys are so butthurt..
---
im also a COMPLETE WoW noob so I'll have almost no idea what to do. Is warrior too difficult for a new player? I played way back then in Vanilla when I was 12 (an undead warlock until level 30ish)

I had a dark whelping that dropped for me in Badlands too back in Vanilla.  He was always by my side.

I’m on Thalnos. It’s constantly full with queue times. They are offering free migration. However IF is practically empty. It makes me so sad. I’m hoping it’s just cause folks are out power leveling. I sincerely hope IF becomes epic once again.
---
Yeah, you need to do it again for rank 2
---
Cheers. Been killed a ton while leveling in Ashenvale, by people in bigger numbers and much higher levels than my friend and I were.
---
Don't understand the fun in trying to ruin someone's experience like that. If similar levels, fair play, it's a PvP server after all. But killing someone you outlevel by a decent chunk is sad.
---
currently just for leveling but it would be good to know my end game goals
---
Someone on Bloodsail trade chat the other night was confused why so many of the guild advertising was for RP guilds. I’m hoping he was trolling, but afraid he wasn’t.
---
You don't just get to pick where you want to transfer for free to and from.  Blizzard put a list and said you can go from A to B, C to D, E to F.
---
Instead he got malice in the palace.

You're asking the wrong person here, but my understanding is that instancing would be you and your group alone in a zone. How I understand layering is like, everyone in your server is on one server, but you have mini servers (layers)  inside that server, so you and your friend could be standing next to each other, but you might not see them because you're not in the same layer, until you add your friend to your group and you then both are in the same layer standing next to eachother. So you have instances,  but it's more fluid. One thing I would add to the metaphor the article uses is saying that "there are hoses connecting the glasses on the tray so you could have an osmosis effect, moving populations from cup to cup and helping with not one cup becoming too full.
---
I hope this is the right place to ask:  what is layering and why are people worried about it?
---
French Enchanters literally trying to make this bread.
---
&gt; I am the only person in the zone should result in more than 5 nodes.
---
lol no
---
How have you not got zerker and intercept??
---
Thanks for the new wallpaper
---
Exactly how i like it.
---
Depends if it's on an Oceanic server I guess.
---
I'm level 32 on Kirtonos.  On my server most people are in the 30-40 range it seems.
---
&gt;We’ve seen screenshots of banks full of rare crafting materials, which we’ve investigated and proved false.
---
I knew it. Just photoshop trolling
---
"this isn't my first rodeo mate" /ignore
---
What an absolute fucking badass
---
True, it can be. But it's also incredibly easy to track those exploiting it. They just have to write a database script that exclusively track those that hopped layers regularly while gathering resources.
---
Was hoping this was to explain how one layer didn’t spawn any NPCs in IF till restart. Hopefully each maintenance that get rid of the last few bugs. My experience so far has been stellar.
---
Gotta turn the graphics down.
---
Also the world feels massive on foot. Damn stonetalon.....
---
Is odd remember all the old stats for classes lol. Like I remember stacking mad strength on my Druid in vanilla. My gear sucked but I hit fucking hard lol.
---
It's all about that Doom Weed.
---
Shadow preists are actually good to have around if you know how to use them. For instance, put a spriest in a group with your warlocks. Or tank. Or both. Now off-spec over main spec I have an issue with, but you seem to have no clue about how classes can perform in a raid scenario.
---
I disagree. Over time you can find people who really enjoy having a relationship with the seller. Many people are willing to pay a bit more to buy in bulk since using the AH can be tedious at times.
---
For instance, sometimes the AH is doing a huge upswing of prices for a profession. Like BiS gear, enchanting materials, and potions/flasks right before/during a phase release.
---
Yup it's always around that general area of my desk, it's never really in the way of my hands and when I'm sitting my head is high enough that I just look right over it. It's like the frames of my glasses, visible but I dont actually pay any notice to them
---
Well at end game they aren't good. But all Priests should level as Shadow, so 1-60 is fun times with shadow before endgame :)
---
Nijel connects to Feathermoon lol. What you need is a connection to Theramore

What do you mean abused raid dungeons for xp?

---
You haven't been on often than. At least 2 Oceania wide server disconnect the past 2 weeks. Maybe more I'm not even aware of.
---
I play in USA and I have suffered from many random disconnects.
---
World PvP has made classic for me so far, you should come back!
---
There is as much benefit to this as there is any other form of world PVP. The *goal* is to screw over other players. You can't encourage that behavior, market it as a pro of your system, and then act surprised when players do it.
---
Hell yeah! Can’t wait to get sometime in this weekend
---
I love these pictures
---
you just described me after a STV binge, all Horde there (especially the higher leveled ones) just went out of their way to fuck with me when i went to get my FM at Booty Bay, let alone questing. 
---
now several hours after that, as a very bitter lvl 35 Rogue, i had a field day similarly inconveniencing lvl 20 Horde players just trying to mind their own business in Hillsbrad.
---
hadn't engaged a Horde prior to STV ever, now i just want to spread pain.
---
I know that Arcanite Reaper is listed server for the Whitemane but there is only Sulfuras when I try to transfer.
---
Too bad layering destroys any sense of a bustling city
---
There were more layers earlier on launch, and people have been exploiting it, this is kinda of a half truth post. Maybe not arcane crystals, but I know guildies that had setup alt accounts and made sure they had like 3-5 layers and have hundreds of devilsaur leather.
---
So by killing 3 mobs and calculating their distance of travelling, we can actually get the specific location of their graveyard and if any one of them want to resurrect on spot with penalty, we can gank them as well?
---
it is classic wow. even if we rerolled i cant give it to him. there is no "you can give it to a person from your party for the next 3 hours"
---
But but... I wanna talk in forms... :( oh wells
---
I have some bros on there. Whisper shazbot
---
Man, I loved that.
---
I'm just sick of seeing different channels filled with "invite for layer" spam.
---
Oh you got one of thoes mongo gryphons.
---
Warriors can dual wield you know. (Against green mobs you actually land your hits too!)
---
tanks don’t set rules, 60% of the population play warriors. groups set rules, like i mentioned if everyone is ok with it then there’s no problem. 
---
and isn’t it hilarious you mention ad hominems and attack me right after lmao. typical boomer mentality that thinks he’s the Man and sets his own rules because “he can”. Sounds like you’re projecting your insecurities in-game m8. it’s time to move out of your mothers basement.
---
Competition could be a thing; both good and bad.  
---
Also, iirc there was a respawn based on actually how much was taken. So if there are 12 spawn points on the faces of a clock, you take #12, and run clockwise, you get to #3 and randomly #2 spawns, you may not see anything until you get back to #2. Whereas if randomly #4 spawns, you will see that one. If there are multiple people out there often this means you see more stuff as the respawns happen more.  
---
Like you, I am doing this from memory, but I remember being more successful farming when there were a few people out gathering, rather than on dead servers.
---
This all changed in TBC.
---
I'll play it I'm tired of PUBG and want to play something completely different.  Besides I have two weeks vacation coming up and that will help. Wife will be at work and kids in school. Thanks for all the replies
---
I will tomorrow for sure, I even made friends doing rp (which was a first for me) day 1! I’ll be back friend, we’ll stand on the battle field together
---
I didn't have a problem with it. Was hard to get and made sense in Outland endgame
---
It has the potential to change the economy significantly (my bags full of devilsaur leather from layer hoping say hi).  It allows you to completely escape pvp interactions that defines classic instead of having to deal with the opposite faction, recruit help or go elsewhere.  You can say it doesn’t impact you much or that the impact is minor but to say it has no impact is bogus.
---
Right click your "general" chat tab and click 'create new window'. Name it whatever you plan to use it for. Then right click the tab you just made then click 'settings'. Uncheck the boxes for channels you don't want to show on that tab.  
---
I'll usually make one for guild chat as well.

Someone is sour that they aren’t 60 and running raids already

Dev confirmation that the plural of lotus in Azeroth is lotus.
---
Lol you are an idiot. Please make yourself known ingame so i know who to put on ignore.
---
what’s the first guild to kill rag without anyone taking off work or being on welfare? we know monkeynews and apes will be disqualified so lets make a real list of guilds with players who aren’t welfare queens.
---
No...you will lol. You can use that staff till rfk and try to get the axe
---
I believe he understands that, and is just wondering why, despite Blizzard announcing that Arcanite Reaper being the server Fairbanks and Whitemane will go to if/when selecting 'transfer', it instead shows Sulfuras, and I believe is asking if anyone else has encountered the same.
---
There’s a lot of people right now going to the shorter RP queue and then trolling actual RP players by clogging the public channels with stereotyped bullshit comments. 
---
The real RP is happening all through the world in say, party, guild, emote, and private channels.   Realm or world spanning channels are immersion breaking for IC communication anyway.
---
That druid is a chad
---
Lock should not be pulling aggro from tank tbh. As a tank I mainly have mages and shaman pulling threat so far and I’m level 35 Arms spec. As far as threat meters go, the only ones I know of require other players to have it for it to work properly. Give it some time and maybe a new threat addon will come out or an old one will be streamlined.
---
Did the opposite, ran my Blood Elf Hunter to Bloodmyst for that named spiky spider.
---
Of course it's griefing. It's a PVP game.
---
29 also checking in lol
---
This is a zperl issue unfortunately. I’ve switched to Shadowed Unit Frames for this reason. Check them out. You might like it.
---
Everyone thinks that but that only applies to like p4+ when your locks have enough crit hit and the spriest is geared. Early as a spriest you’ll be oom a min into the fight and useless unable to apply shadow debuff but that’s just my opinion.
---
Also the locks are mediocre early on until they get the hit they so badly need. So again spriest dps lol
---
Edit*
---
reroll pve server casual
---
or back to retail
---
But the /who is redundant? If you're seeing noone you already know you are on an empty layer...
---
Safe zones go up through about level 20.
---
install a guide into it?   the addon isnt ready to go?
---
I [see](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-character-moves-now-available-in-this-region/285965/20).  The only thing left to do is delete your character!
---
11int always better.
---
I have not seen a single streamer playing classic wow that hasn't disappointed me in their approach to the game at some point. There are a couple of niche guys that are creating amazing, moving content, but most of the twitch guys are awful. Would not recommend watching twitch while playing classic.
---
10 slot bag at that level is no joke though. I ran it and I'm Alliance for crying out loud
---
Faaack now i gotta wait longer in que
---
I don’t have a link but there’s a guy with a series on it, of like 20 minute videos. Watched them last year and literally played bfa 90% on the auction house using tsm, just fucking the stock on the server and inflating prices, funnest shit ever.
---
I found the list.  People have assumed they could transfer anywhere, so I thought it might be that.
---
Totally disagree on multi-level of the dungeons, it just devalues it when you finally work on the hardest level.  You saw pretty much everything, now it’s just scaled higher.  I get why it’s useful, but no just no.
---
Yup!  All these people just accepting blizzards response are kidding themselves.  You don’t need to be later hoping to 25 layers to exploit this.  3-4 means you can constantly farm and high end zones are still very empty as the core player group is 20-40 or sitting inside dungeons.
---
Get out of my rppvp server ya scrub.
---
Undead have some of the best PvP racial
---
Can confirm. am a nelf and lord of the rings is favorite book. Toons name is in elvish
---
Same lvl 37 I feel like everyone is around my level. I feel like I’m behind.
---
Alliance simply cause there is more horde. Help the balance
---
Thats a pretty stupid take imo. Ofc people are gona ask "whats next", not everyone fiended Pservers for 10 years waiting for classic release. Many people are unhappy with the direction WoW took and see Classic as a fresh start to fix these mistakes.
---
Props for NL on second monitor. I play the same way
---
Lovely! What are you going to name it though?
---
Its ok i got your point and its valid. All i wanted to complain about was how the layer hoping and the dynamic respawn system is abused. Why some pseudo wannabe eletists think that makes me a crying bitch or a looser is beyond me but hey Reddit is easy to access is guess. Btw i dont even know what Reddit karma is good for so i dont really care
---
Nice kill.
---
And is that a Robert Johnson song? Excellent choice!
---
Basically need on anything youll actually use with a few exceptions.
---
Ie. If something has like 10 int and 20 healing on it, but a warlock takes it because they just dont have anything better, obviously you should still pass to a healer because its a healer item.
---
Otherwise, its usually fair game, usually its the opposite, casters getting mad at healers for needing on SP gear just because they have nothing better
---
That's an oddly specific post on the number of layers. Single digit number = 0-9. Most have a low single digit number = There's less than 10 layers
---
Layers or queues. You can only pick one. I choose layers. People need to get over it.
---
This. I'm level 11 on my warrior (Holy shit Warrior Leveling is so difficult), and level 8 on my Hunter. I have so much fun just leveling, and I've been playing since classic launched...I'm just taking my time.
---
whats that weapon
---
Awesome thank you so much
---
Haha I know it is atrocious but more time spend on making arrows is less time playing
---
There is an option to have the loot window always appear at your cursor location. There is also an option to auto loot everything (you still have to right click to loot). 
---
Worth noting the default is shift+right click to auto loot. If you switch auto-loot on, then the shift+right click becomes the opposite (lets you selectively loot). I recommend having auto loot on and then shift-clicking chests and such that you might not want to take everything from, or if your bags are getting full.
---
That's not really all that more efficient than just running a circular route long enough for respawns to occur though.
---
No it's not
---
Forgot about the Method race to 100% quest completion and complete tier sets. That's a nail biter race. By this logic retail is amazing.
---
Yeah enjoy your 50c
---
op in pvp, rogue and mage undead are really good at killing alliance mages and warlocks
---
Just got Bonebiter, I pretty much do half health of any caster in one swing. Makes it pretty funny when some mage 4 levels lower thinks he can take me because of his cute little frost nova :’)
---
I wish they were in the LFG channel. World chat is currently a layering  requests and guild ads channel.
---
I think that posts that start with 'unpopular opinion' should be banned, especially since they almost always are popular opinions.
---
On the authority that it is a opinion and therefore by definition cannot be wrong.
---
 
---
1. a single dev doesnt make it a fact, its still a opinion, a opinion of a single dev. 
---
2. your under the assumption the spirit of a genre and how a single person plays has to be the same, they do not. but that does not change that mmorpg is suppose to be at its core, partly social, which is rendered largely meaningless with multiboxing (for most multiboxers).
---
3. your speaking semantics, like i mentioned in 2. spirit of the game, you can play how you want, there is no wrong way to play a game, just like you can speed run a zelda game, its not wrong, its just not how it was intended to be played.
---
now on what authority do you have to turn a opinion into fact?
---
Heart of the wild, nature swiftness, with one point in natures grasp is the most common druid spec I think. Never played one though. Great for flag running, pve healing, feral stuff.
---

---
Theres a discord??!? I will join it
---
&gt; Instead of gathering some people in /general and having some memorable PvP experience or something alike and contesting the zone, the way it was done in vanilla and the way it should be done, they just layer out.
---
Realistically very few people actually did this. Everybody I played with at the time would have just logged off rather than deal with it.
---
Quick question, is it possible to set up if I am away from my PC? Im currently traveling in another country so I cant get my phone to be on the same wifi as my PC. 
---
Thanks for the help
---
Says the person paying for free food lmao.
---
Don't worry, I wont be grouping with idiots like you
---
Christ, you're giving me PTSD.
---
This is more important to me than all of the Rag first kills.
---
It's generally accepted when you take someone for any roll pre 30 or so that loot is just to whoever can use it, 90% of your tanks and healers are just DPS filling the role at that point.
---
When gear lasts longer 30+ role rolling becomes more important, and at 40+ its role rolled or there's drama but I don't know anyone blacklisting level 27 tanks for taking a DPS weapon.
---
It is how it works. Legit, the roll system helps even out item distribution even if everyone, your dog and your mother needed on everything.
---
The only thing greed does is allow a bit better chances for someone to actually use the item they need on, if 4 people out of 5 think they need it for leveling, offspec or whatever, that's on them to decide, not you to judge.
---
If you don't like it, find 4 like minded friends and group with them, you're never forced to party with anyone you don't want to.
---
Play burning crusade or later
---
&gt; resource scarcity has been slashed and divided by however many layers there are
---
you realise that layers make no difference to the amount of resources per person on the server
---
.. you conjure water  you definitely didn't need the 1 or 2 points of spirit to justify needing it with a rogue in your group.
---
Out of curiosity, why does it "cringe" you? ERP I can understand, and I was exactly like you way back when I was in I think eighth grade and rolled a gnome on Moon Guard just to troll. But through trolling there I kind of came to realise that it added a whole nother layer to the game that had the potential to be extremely enjoyable. Creating a character with a history and a life is really cool to me and something I wish I had more time to do. I don't play on RP servers now, but I can definitely see myself getting into that somewhere down the line.

I wanted my main AT LEAST 40 by this week. And it's now Thursday. 
---
Soooooo..... I hear ya
---
I would of gotten one at 18 if warrior didn’t roll need on int ring from dm....
---
Blizz have made it clear that they are open to the idea, but no commitment, as it largely depends on the uptake of Classic. It'll be a long while yet before anything is announced.

Progression/hardcore raiding IS like a job. Even on retail, with 20-25 man raids, mythic level raiding is serious during progression. You only usually goof around when you're re-clearing stuff you already have on farm. 
---
Think about it; you have a schedule which is usually 3-4 nights per week, where you are expected to turn up on time and for 4-6 hours and to bring your A game. You are also expected to use time outside these nights to prepare for the raids, usually quite a lot of time. You are expected to tell your raid leader in advance if you are going to miss a session for whatever reason. The list goes on. Does that sound like a job to you? Progression raiding is not for everyone.
---
We don’t have to talk about it, let’s just play wow
---
Raid leaders set rules and a Tank is a great raid leader. 90% of warriors dont tank.
---
Yup just like In thought, you're a child. I never used ad hominem. The fact you took offense to it proves it was accurate.
---
SexyMap does a good job of this.
---
Only a few addons and I have everything how and where I want it, except the quest tracker, that thing is stuck in a horrible location.
---
I just finished my Ph.D. and I don't want to even think about what Classic would have done to me if it'd released last year.
---
Mostly because there is no logic behind the arguments against layer abuse which usually gets me responding regardless of topic.
---
But also because I'm getting over this trend of gaming subreddits becoming less about discussing the game and more about complaining about it. Another game I play called "path of exile" used to have a great subreddit, but after their main competitor "Diablo" dropped the ball there was a massive influx in player numbers and now if you go there it's just full of people whining about subjective aspects of the game that have existed since the start. Literally over half the front page is just whining about stuff being too hard or players progressing faster than them.
---
I've been playing regularly for nearly 2 weeks, and I'm surprised I'm only on 2 days /play at lvl29. Insane to see some people with 6-7 days /play.
---
The Warrior only gets truly strong when he levels solo. It's punishing, but you will never get to know your class better than by surviving out there alone...
---
Ya but then you got paladins who can already wear mail to compete with =P

I was questing in Ashenvale, the nice and friendly undead priest i was - I didnt kill any smol questing alliance Players...I mean hey its not honorable to kill people way lower than you anyways. I ran around hugging and greeting everyone, no matter if Horde or alliance. Some Levels later everything changed....i was searching for a nice bush to hide in hillsbrad to go get some food,  when I saw a lvl 34 Gnome Attack an innocent lvl 24 warrior struggling with a bear. I jumped out of the bush to help. Got killed some many times while questing there later on too and changed my mind completely. When I see alliance I attack no Matter what. Had some very nice pvp fights today in thousand needles!

I'd disagree bot. This is a discussion post about 3 classes particularly the hybrid healers. Not about which class go play specifically.
---
Lol yeah, cuz as a tank... your only use is to carry my butt through the dungeon and feed me with tasty loot to propel my lvling. You want to do that too? Then why you reduce yourself to tank!?
---
Know your place right?
---
Stories like these make me feel like most DPS can be quite ingrate with the easiest and most rewarding roles.

Yeah I soloed him on my rogue for the 50 silver knuckles he drops until I got my epic mount, this was before instance reset limits iirc so I was doing a ton.

I got it at like level 68 as a Druid. I don’t think I even had to do a quest. Maybe I did.

Well first of all it's establishing an economy at several times the regular rate due to so many people being able to skin/mine/herb the same nodes essentially due to layers. So all these vendorable items are entering the game at an alarming pace and right now it's fine but a week or two down the road it's just  going to be a huge mess.

Your minimap only displays the interior of the bank in classic. Like when you enter a cave and it shows an “interior” map of the cave, same idea. The screenshot showed the general area on the minimap still, the way it worked/works on pservers.
---
Im starting to think the unstable triggers are VERY UNSTABLE
---
TIL I'm gonna be a thorium crystal and black lotus farmer.
---
Everything up to thorium has been as expected; I've found Mithril to be fairly plentiful, which is why the lack of Thorium has surprised me so much.
---
The switch does not run the OS off of SD. You would need to go through the steps to run homebrew software off an SD card.

Ya, you are right.  I'll take my dry sarcastic logic somewhere else where im less likely to hurt feels.

*eyeroll*
---
&gt; Do you guys not have phones?™

The amount of people who didn't get this reference is *Classic*.

Usually roll for chests but to be honest I have been in many groups through out the years and always remembered the locked chest went to the rogue unless he was extremely nice...so do you and make that money😎
---
Edit :spelling
---
Sure feels like it. And I love it.

Yo I'm about to ding 30 on my warrior and am the same type of person. Aim for 40!

Why posting a photo of yourself to a bunch of wow wierdos u don't even know.Wtf was she expecting ?
---
Wow, I bought mine for 1.5g on Morgraine Eu horde :) in booty bay (not sure if they are separate).
---
Always roll, or at least open a discussion on why you qualify for entitlement, because they might not have known that you're the only one who could open it, or probably didn't know it was locked to begin with.
---
I use this [site](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/), all of them work but some of them are a bit outdated
---
Guys. I didnt read all of the responses so if it was explained, I'm sorry but its unfortunatly(and temporarily) intentional. This was blizz's way of trying to ease the leveling of areas with a dense number of players and as you get higher levels, you will notice it less but maybe they will have it changed by then.
---

This should work with steam in home streaming as well so no specific gpu required.
---
Fuck, I don’t get it.
---
anyway to find out how many ally vs horde are on a certain server?
---
specifically grobbulus or deviate delight?
---
we all saw it man, we all saw it
---
It's not like Fortitude is cheap on mana either bro, and we don't get free water on demand to fill up, yet I still drive by buff people.
---
Same here. 32 lock and just started a dudu for when I'm playing alone. I just can't resist alting
---
If you were a minmaxer, wouldn’t you go to a forum about the game you’re playing to discuss it?
---
Dead right. Look at the asmongold outrage, 15K upvotes for something nobody should really be surprised and/or give a shit about.
---
From someone looking at that post without knowing whats going on, it's laughably petty to give a shit about, and that's the majority of "controversy" on this sub.
---
Glad you are taking it to the alliance scum
---
&gt;. Usually it comes down to a /roll if anyone could access it. It in this case it’s yours
---
Thanks for the reply, at the same time though (and at the risk of sounding hypocritical) I don't agree with some rogues who see every locked chest as solely theirs, as (as far as I know) they have no material investment in picking a lock.
---
Hahaha nice well done sir.
---
I hate it
---
What a group of absolute heroes, particularly that dashing dwarf friidge wow
---
Some of them are joking, some of them aren’t. The number of people telling me without a trace of irony that they don’t get the point of RP and don’t want to deal with RPers (on Bloodsail!) is going to give me an aneurism.
---
They don't join as a resto shaman. They join as the groups healer. Then needing gear for the spec they actually are, is a legitimate need roll.
---
Faster, guaranteed money vs the chance of waiting a day or two for a less realistic price to sell, if at all. He can then take that money and generate further income through tradeskills or just playing the AH.
---
If I told you that you could invest and gain 20% every 2 hours or 100% every day, which would you pick?

Where we have no idea who the people are who did it, we just think it's funny. We aren't being asked to **don't forget to like and subscribe**.

---
I'm ootl what's layering
---
Keybinds.
---
Yes, streams the audio and video to your switch and controls back to the PC.
---
It’s less of what they’re doing and more of what they say.
---
The way I've worked it over the years is any green up Items get rolled on by the group and the junk/mats go to the BS as a "key fee". If the BS wants to give some mats to people that can use them that he/she would just vendor that's up to them.
---
Not even summoning is affected. On retail, you can summon people with war mode different of you (essentially a different layer)
---
I rock razor arrows and its a huge noticeable upgrade, def should not have any issues buying them.
---
That'd be a great idea be if Arrow was actually a good show
---
Or it could end up like Striking Vipers
---
Then every server would be Moonguard.
---
Oh sweet summer child...
---
Un’Goro is in WoW?  I just started WoW from playing Hearthstone for the last several years.  I’m looking forward to actually seeing all these places.
---
Nice.
---
Wow I still feed my cat and play with her WHILE I’m online. Sometimes even okay with her when she puts her butthole in my face in front of the computer screen, or when my hand move my mouse she’ll attack my hand, and I squeeze her lil face and shake her around, my cat is my baby. Couldn’t imagine not playing with her and watching her dig into her wet food everyday, she’s such a cutie. Sorry I love my cat, I hope your brother changes this behavior soon. Life is always prioritized over video games.
---
I have a picture of my kitty if you click my profile.
---
Also, there is no way he had any gold to give you at that level. He was lying to you anyways with no intention of giving you the gold. Sorry you had that experience but it gets better
---
What's bis? The only other staff I can find with comparable stats is the emberstone one from deadmines but this one is still better
---
Nothing to see here folks, just neckbeard douche bags that hate streamers. Who gives a fuck, move on, not everything is about making up for your tiny penis or being picked on. This is nothing.
---
Layers probably don't influence queues as much as you might think.
---
We had someone roll on loot like normal and if you won the boe he would ask if he could  purchase it for his alt and we were fine with that. But needing for an alt is just plain fucked up. We ended up giving it for free because he wasn’t a dick and asked.
---
Blizzard should defintively take a look into this.
---
How awesome would it be to play wow on a portable console/phone.
---
The "don't you guys have phones" guy was more than right.
---
K
---
Yeah that's layering. Unfortunate but we have to deal with it until the population drops a bit.
---
I mean they did point it out and say "too bad it's locked" to which I replied "oh nice I got this" which I guess they could have taken as me offering to unlock it for whoever. Either way though I have a sneaking suspicion it wouldn't have been an issue at all were it not for it being a blue.
---
Nice! Been using Blizzlike unitframes but those look too good to pass up. Thanks!
---
I'm fine with this, provided you keep your windfury totem up at all times.
---
Haha thank you!
---
It’s funny, I actually live in High Point NC! Where’s my GSO peps?

Internet signal must be pretty bad down there, maybe he is still trying to upload everything?

should i not play on the streamer server faerlina?. i have an alliance mage thinking of transferring to herod

It's not a real bar of gold, this is like "Who's line is it anyway", the values don't matter and everything is made up. But you are right, I'm no currency/rare metal specialist..

I'll see if i can do it, my source of income has been trash since i funnel it to my tank

It’s just a console command.

Hell, the parrot pet dropped for me in Deadmines today and by luck of the loot, it should have been mine, but I let everyone roll and gave it to the winner.

I need good karma.

I had rubberbanding tonight. Just in stockades. It was glorious and hilarious.

Honestly it was probably like "Hey I need a name to give the directory"

"Just put retail"

"Ok"

People out here acting like there was some intense meeting of directors trying to determine the most appropriate way to name the file directory.

“You played ya self” Lord JesusCrust
---
Well no shit, Sherlock, I'm just offering up an example of the only time I've done so.
---
Perfect, that's exactly what you should ask that person because I'd like to hear their response, if any. Personally my gut tells me more layers equals more drops equals cheaper prices equals good for me. People don't seem to agree, plus different players have different desired economies.
---
The public wifi is probably blocking the ports, the application uses 80, 443, 1119 tcp/udp
---
Quests will probably be your primary way of leveling. Kill everything that crosses your path as well for XP and drops, to reduce periods during leveling where you might otherwise have to grind mobs, and to get money for your level 40 mount. Dungeons are good if you've got a good group, and they're worth doing for the quests. You can also skip them, but I recommend hitting one once in a while just to brush up on your group roles.
---
I have to disagree with not using addons your first time around. The stock UI is hot garbage. I wouldn't recommend getting a full UI suite/replacement until you've got a feel for the game, but there are some "Blizzlike" UIs like modui that'll make the UI more useful for you. 
---
Can't help with macros, I don't use a lot of them myself.
---
Wowhead Classic is your bread and butter for information. Guides, maps, detailed creature drops and spawn locations, you name it.
---
Same situation. Full time job, house, family events, birthdays, and I’m learning Python. It’s totally worth it though for me. Sure I’m not playing as much as I use to when I was younger, but honestly it’s not much of an issue. Less time to play, but I’m more methodical now with the time I get.
---
Log in and get right to leveling. I’m also managing my professions and secondary professions better this time around. So it feels overall easier this time around.
---
I'm sorry to hear. I'm level 25 and I want to play more and more each day.
---
Lol yup! New tool album came out too so I told myself all August "going to play wow classic and listen to the new tool all day!"
---
I mean, if Blizzard has stated they can't help, you're out of luck.  
---
If you haven't contacted their support, I'd do that.
---
You can add progression without killing old content. Everquest did it for quite a while back in the day.
---
Just dont logoff
---
They are fine only a few minor issues which haven’t been in the game for a few days! I’m
---
Lvl 55 it’s amazing playing on such low ping can finally play warrior in classic
---
Had this happen in a raid years back.  One of the dudes had the other guy on ignore and didn't see his roll.  
---
He got super pissed that we gave it too him.  
---
We just laughed and let him believe he got screwed over.
---
is there a way around this?
---
You are blaming the victim here (not a victim of something serious, of course) - but you have to be careful when extrapolating this line of thought to other things. 
---
But anyway, she didn't do anything actually wrong. If it was  a guild, the members were probably her friends, lol, which just makes everything worst. It's like you should expect the worst from any wow player - and I don't want to think like that about our player base :/
---
That’s why you have your healer priests go deep into shadow for the debuff, but just heal and maintain it
---
Call Blizzard as soon as their lines are open. But first, if you have control of your account again, get the Blizzard Authenticator app on your mobile device so you don't have to worry about it happening again.
---
We have to wait until Phase 2 drops to get the  PVP trinket to break most CC.  Otherwise you could use  Skull of Impending Doom to break CC or the BOP blacksmithing trinket that makes you fear immune for 30s
---
Gotem
---
You really will. 
---
Wailing caverns has no good 2 hander drops that aren't staffs, and SFK is actually kind of lacking. You will piss off every caster in the group if you roll on the staffs from BFD, but the strike of the hydra is a 20% drop, so you have to on average run BFD 5 times to even get it. 
---
you can do battle of hillsbrad for a quest replacement, but that's pretty late. And Trying to dps through gnomer or RFK without even a crescent staff is not ideal.
---
CC stops your pet attacks.
---
I know how much fun I had before and I want to have that fun again lol
---
I forgot about that album coming out.  That sounds like a great plan though!
---
As you play you will notice your pet get a glow and noise similar to the level up ding but not as big. If I'm not mistaken that's his loyalty going up and it gives you more pet points to learn the skills.
---
Its a hidden reroll
---
Prolly get 1.5-2.5g for it
---
Awesome!
---
Yea dude, it is among the coolest things I've done in the many years of playing this game.
---
I mean, do you think that if things were fucked Blizzard would write a topic tha they fucked up badly, but they can't do anything as players simply used a feature of a game? Like cmon. Not saying that are lying there, but this statement is 50/50.
---
PLZ
---
people have been calling the current "live" version of wow retail for literally years, long before the word "retail" was used in the official wow files.
---
Some disconnects, but it's going back online faster.  
---
Honestly, apart from the first DC occurrence, it's been fine.
---
Yeah it probably doesn't help that I rerolled at 29 and second char is 22 now lol
---
Literally lol'd at work. I got that reference. Dude was a legend.

Is there something i can do about this?

Hey my name is Nijel I have a basketball game tomorrow. I'm a point guard I got shoe game.

How will you find he who has no name?
---
How was I being hostile or flippant in my comment?
---
What addon is that? The one that shows the levels required
---
I think people are just leveling tbh
---
Server?
---
I think classic is about having fun and doing what you enjoy. Not one side or the other.
---
Y'know there is a strong multi-boxing community that exists right? These people come together to overcome the challenges involved with multi-boxing WoW and other games. 
---
So sounds like, by your own definition, they are existing fine within the 'purpose' of the game.
---
Probably not, the administrator would have to allow those ports (if they're blocked) and I can't imagine they will. You could ask though
---
I’ve just started carrying a few extra stacks in my bag, small chance I’ll fill up on loot before I need them.
---
A blue lvl 25 item could still be best-in-slot for a lvl29 twink.
---
Free transfers from Herod to Earthfury right now. Im transferring as we speak
---
Please DON'T remove them on Faerlina. I'm in a 80 minute queue right now and a few hours ago me and some guildies had to fight tooth and nail to farm earth elementals in Badlands, there are too many people doing the same quest in every area lower than lvl 55 right now.
---
What if a hunter wants to be a melee hunter
---
The fucking auction house isn't layered bro...
---
Sure, but go look up Somnus' loot table. It's not very exciting.
---
IMO better to get Bestial Wrath from BM tree for leveling
---
Get pre raid bis gear and start making it known that you’re a face melter.
---
If it didn't happen in Vanilla, it won't happen in Classic.
---
Cool, thanks
---
Is it in your action bar?
---
can't they just delete layers, nobody wants them, they're busted and the world feels like a huge ghost town even on a fully populated server
---
Ah shit, thanks for the info.
---
Nobody's salty, but without knowing the server/faction it's a pretty pointless post.  More people need to be talking shit on the realm forums anyway.
---
This. Just did the ww quest and tried to buy some charms on the AH. 4 gold for 8 charms.
---
They were 1 gold a piece yesterday but no one is stupid enough to buy so they're dropping. I just got them with the help of a friend instead. Wasnt hard even at lvl 33.
---
I'd guess people would be willing to pay 25s per charm and that's still a lot given their relatively high drop rate.
---
Hahaha that’s gold! I’m just about to re level engineering finished crafting all the bop items now to do it all as gnomish haha 😂
---
You can think about it that way, sure. Each layer is an separate instance of Azeroth so that there is enough room for everyone to play.  The issue here is that people have been jumping from one instance to the other to gain advantages. If you find a Black Lotus you gather it and then hop to other layers hoping to find it there so you can gather more. Or people layer hopping to avoid PvP.
---
When did things change? Is it different on different servers? I played heavily until wotlk, and then played each expansion until I got bored (only took 1mo with BFA), so I'm not the most consistent player, but back in Vanilla, IF used to be buzzing, and I used to prefer SW, due to hardware. Now, everyone seems to hang out in Stormwind? Is there a reason, or has it just happened that way?
---

I’m a 28 warlock, affliction talents. But a feel like my dps is really weak. When I group up with other I’m always on the lower end based on my damage addon. What am I doing wrong? I’m getting out dps’d by hunters rogue and almost everything. I thought kicks were one of the highest dps?!
---
What professions should I do as a warrior? I was orginally gonna go mining/blacksmithing but I am playing with two friends who are mining/blacksmithing and mining/alchemy and I feel like we would be competing alot.

The continents don't belong to factions.  The Night Elves start there because the Night Elves live there.

Solid I may have to re sub tonight! Bye bye social life haha!
---
please i need to know as well
---
Wow!  How have we never heard this opinion before?
---
I'm kind of curious if another major game release will pull a chunk of streamers away. Like, they would follow the hype of new instead of streaming the same dungeon for the 100th time.
---
Except for charging for power infusion, that's okay.
---
Engineering and mining. Tell the alchemist to go herbalist m
---
Nobody else but yourself can say whether it is worth it or not. 
---
Also who cares what streamers are doing. They are so ahead because it's their job and literally the only thing they do.
---
He probably has to honestly. He can't go anywhere on his main, even off stream, without everyone knowing about it. He would be griefed 24/24.

There's a dock outside darnassus (the nelf capital)that will take you elsewhere. Also, continents aren't faction specific.

This is why you use overpower after they dodge... so you can miss that as well

---
Is the Warlock affliction tree capstone Dark Pact even worth it?  Seems rather umderwhelming looking at it on paper
---
Which is why 30-42 is this awkward time for enhancement shaman because while Ravager is good the lack of stats and sometimes inconvenient proc (for leveling) are meh. You're kind of in lala land till 40 when some nice slow 2h's drop from stuff like Uldaman
---
Pole arms are a gold!
---
Main thing guaranteeing your raid spot will be showing up to raid night will full pre-bis, as well enchanted as you can get. As well as just being an overall active and helpful guild member. Look up a pre-bis guide for your class if you're unsure what items to go for at 60.
---
Talent choice matters somewhat, but you can usually get by with a hybrid PVP/PVE spec and people won't really notice.
---
From what I've heard Bestial Discipline is really bad.  I'd max out Ferocity  since you are probably going for Frenzy after anyways. Personally I'm going 21/30/0 so I stopped at 2/5 Ferocity and Intimidation.
---
pretty cheap compared to a lot of hobbys.
---
My motorcycle is over 100 a month as a hobby.
---
Kayaking costs me at least 50 if i account for gas and vehicle usage.
---
Parachuting is expensive.
---
Hell drawing is over 25 a month if you draw a lot.
---
$75 is less than 3 hours of labor for a lot of people, its a drop in the bucket.
---
My auctions since launch have been expiring after 2 hours. I had one auction mod at the time, and switched to a different on thinking that was it. But I didn't think it was possible to post an auction for 'short' duration.
---
Anybody have any suggestions?
---
You should probably mention that rule of thumb at the beginning of a dungeon though, otherwise your need rolling may come across as dickish to people who don't follow that rule. A mage needing on a plate BoE piece while I, as a shaman, roll greed on it would annoy me quite a bit, for example.
---
I guess that's the point he was making. Also, could just be my memory, but I swear player models didn't blink in Vanilla, but they do in Classic.

Can’t test yourself?
---
This is ridiculous, shit like this is why blizzard is so salty when it comes to customer service sometimes. The game has been out for a week, if you hate your character’s name delete it and make a new one. If you are a dick and have a bad rep on your current name then you probably deserve to have to keep it, I can’t think of any other reason people would want a name change this early in.
---
Fuck that though, I don't want to abuse it, but if I want to meet with 3 different friends in a short space of time, just for trades and stuff, I want to be able to, and rn, that REQUIRES switching parties, because I have literally never been on the same layer as any of my irl friends when we've tried to meet outside of parties.

Deviate delight ia awesome. But i feel it should have MORE people.

nah he doesn't, i tested it. i tried to get soul shard while draining before mob dies. i ks, and since i get 0 xp, it also doesn't give me shard.

I currently can't access wow classic because money's tight for a bit.

From the two of you

Take the dog for a long walk while I sit in que after work. Run him later in the evening around dinner and again after gaming. Also all of the pets he wants when ever he wants them. They are more important than a game guys.

Can't find a classic faction map for some reason, but here's one from the MOP expansion
---
[https://i.imgur.com/JJFBj8p.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/JJFBj8p.jpg)
---
The only differences between that and classic are Azshara (neutral/night elf), Hillsbrad (bottom is alliance). Ignore the islands and stuff on the north/south/etc, those are expansions.
---
Then this makes no sense and OP is stupid
---
Try this one https://pastebin.com/Eha4Hfwz I made some changes.  The mailboxes and Brikk issue seem to be resolved but I couldn't do much research on the last issue because theres more than 4 NPCs in there.  The changes I made might of fixed those as well so let me know

Instancing normally refers to areas only your group can enter.
---
Layers are continent wide and anyone can join your layer.

Here ya go!

From the census data posted you are ahead of the curve and will catch up easy. Also, always play what makes you happy.

Yes, it separates ID's I believe and filters results accordingly, but I may be wrong

---
My friend got his today too, AOE farm and selling bags. He didn't even need to borrow anything.
---
you have no clue...
---
Yea lol, I just picked the first angsty CW show I could think of.
---
I also don't think I've ever said blizz has done anything amazing aside from the raids, like I enjoy retail but it's dumbed down to a ridiculous level and I've felt that way since they removed talents in wrath
---
Personally I stopped giving my opinion on posts if I disagreed with the mob mentality just because its not worth the effort. I'm sure many others are the same. 
---
People latch onto an idea and just stick with it, its even worse when the original poster provides pseudo-proof alongside an outrageous statement.
---
*facepalm* why would they follow you for so far.  Normally anyone would think it is super suspicious that you're at just the right distance the whole time.
---
I would take that with a massive grain of salt. Dude also praised classic then just did dungeon grinds. Said he wouldn't ask for help then accepted gold for his mount. Yeah of course it sucks that his main character will get followed around while streaming but you know what doesn't suck? Making seven figures for playing a game you constantly praised.
---
He's not some hero making a noble sacrifice lol. There is always the option to make a secret character and play it offstream.
---
This is true whether there's one layer or 10 layers. People who get to 60 first will hoard it all and have a huge advantage for a while. 
---
Ultimately it's about supply and demand. The price of lotus/devilsaur/etc. would become astronomical if it was somehow limited to only a single layer. And the first people to 60 would still have all the advantage.
---
that video is what convinced me to try a rogue out in the first place, and I've not looked back since. I was stoked when I got a sword with the same model in retail so I could transmog my weapons to look like them.
---
How long are you listing them for? I'm assuming 2 hours.
---
Shaman would go well with Priest, lots of heals and they can tank (somewhat) while the priest does damage. They don't have any real aggro management skills, so the priest will probably end up taking some hits. 
---
Both can res, so that's nice.
---
Other than that, a druid would fit the niche quite well as they can tank/DPS/heal and work well with a priest regardless of the situation. Only thing is that it takes a while before druids come online.

Need if you need. Yes, it can easily be abused. By the 2% that are real assholes. 
---
Most people understand and respect it.

When I played vanilla this was always understood. Off spec, building for new spec so you don’t suck off the hop, lots of reasons to need on gear you might not NEED.

---
Nobody cares about your feelings, I feel like this can’t be overstated enough.
---
Not really, they can tank they just have to work for it.
---
Bit hard to kite it there after killing it...
---
And in enters Forsaken Dks.
---
Gave their lives as humans against the scourge. Died, got rezed and broke free as Forsaken. Sacraficed themselves against the scourge again, only to become a DK because Arthas.
---
Then Arthas kills them again to make them Super DKs.

Mograine the entire time: The fuck are you doing, stop dieing.

wool on the action bars - nice

Boar.
---
You may be right. If so I better get onto that ;P I got the recipe in the bank, but I'll do it at max level once everyone's stopped farming it so hard.
---
There are some special pets out there for hunter. I know there is a site that has em, but I'm on mobile and I'm a Priest. 😳
---
That's where the tree is.
---
Is this Bloodsail?
---
Cersei, Ilyn Paine, the mountain, xboyslayerxx, drugdub, smelltoes...
---
It's good for people who don't farm but instead buy materials and for those that abuse layering to farm. It's bad for those who farm but don't abuse layering as their mats they farm are worth less due to higher supply.
---
I was always under the impression at a tie the game auto re rolled on the backend to determine a tie breaker. No evidence to support though
---
I mean they're coming eventually
---
Warrior would be good and off heals from a shadow priest you two would be deadly
---
Need more rage.
---
Boar or cat....
---
Boar more tanky (charge bite dash)
---
 Cat more damage(bite and claw plus dash and prowl )
---
Didn't help that people like Mark Kern and Alexensual are perpetuating it on twitter.
---
Go on. Go

---
Just purchase another Free transfer and select the same character you chose to transfer previously. It will tell you the status of the pending transfer.
---
Have you found any more technical explanations?  Not sure I follow the water glass example
---
I mean I don't care about laying but it definitely effects the economy and makes it harder for the causal player to earn money farming mats as they are worth less due to higher supply.

They can get away with it in dungeons if they're good but no one wants them as main tanks in raids. Warrior was the only 100% legit tank in Vanilla.

Layers have been an enormous success so far. The upsides have WAY outweighed the downsides which will be entirely short term.

As of early last week, there are now two versions. 
---
World of Warcraft is the game that's been running for 15 years. It's also called retail wow by people here. 
---
World of Warcraft Classic is over a week old and is a version of World of Warcraft that's emulating how the game was from 2004-2006. 
---
You don't need any experience to play either game and I highly recommend Classic.
---
alright, thanks
---
I'm legit new and have never played an MMO before. Wasn't hard to ask my party before my first ever dungeon tonight how it worked.
---
I left my first run through DeadMines with 0 rates and about 15 silver worth of loot. A mage rolled need on very single item.
---
My second run was better, but that first one sucked. The closest thing I've ever played to this game is Pokemon Red.
---
If I can figure it out, so can the other new people. It's not complicated.
---
Newbie as fuck here, are bank accounts just to hold extra shit lmfao
---
He’s just an rper not allowed to wave
---
Also "Gnome Mage"
---
yes.
---
You are wasting your own time, friend.
---
Sounds like you're using an add-on designed for retail - in classic, the durations are 2, 8, and 24
---
The whole post essentially says there's no real abuse and that the players are blowing this out of porportion
---
Good to know it’s only 3 Full BRD clears from 59-60, so I only need to run it 25 times 52-60!
---
If you think 40 casuals are going to have anywhere near that easy of a time then the jokes on you.
---
&gt; I thought you could jump through the window while dead to get in?
---
I was certain that was a private server thing. Huh.
---
It doesn't "very clearly say layering was being exploited." You can *infer* that, I suppose, but it is not outright stated, and that's probably intentional.
---
That's what you get for being dirty alliance scum.
---
I don't need my fun to be productive.
---
People forget about the knowledge of game mechanics that are common knowledge today, but that has to be discovered the hard way once.
---
Thats what someone who didnt get their first pick server would say.
---
Its crazy to me that people expect a website with millions of users to display a consistent opinion about anything. REDDIT IS NOT ONE GUY PEOPLE. Calling it hypocrisy is extremely retarded.

Hey!!!! That was me on benediction. Man I'm glad we could help each other out. I had been struggling with the aggressive respawn times of the trolls in zukunda as a warrior. There was no way I could have gotten the tablets by myself.

Every time I hear something along the lines of "issues with layers aren't widespread/that big of a deal"... I just think 3 fucking days played was the world first 60, all because of layering... you killed the first to 60 race.
---
Just pull layering already. It hasn't stopped the appearance of login queues at all so what's the point now that the most of the daily playerbase is out of the starting areas?
---
Seriously, go fuck yourself. He's a fucking veteran and who fucking cares  if he used real money. I don't know you but any person making a comment like that over an imaginary world is just a shitty person who likely has done nothing of value in society. So seriously fuck you.
---
I never said that at all.
---
Correct
---
Again. The people doing it have been killing rag every week for years. They can do it in greens. The average player cannot. This is also why they are 60 already. Also, MC and Ony are the easiest raids.
---
Is there an easy way to see enemy cast bars for efficient interrupting?
---
Prove it!
---
You'll be able to tank them early like phase 1 and 2
---
Flight paths connected to reputation would be a great idea for 4 or 5 years from now.

I would of done the same thing. I think hes the one who wont make it through with his attitude. XD

You should have captured a video and put Yakety Sax over top of it and posted it.  Way more upvotes!

You'll need an add on.
---
I’ve run multiple zf runs with a pally tank. He killed it. Depends on the paladin.
---
Yep. Dot up and wand.
---
He was a douche.  He can't just pull a stupid number of elites and expect you to save his butt.
---
Fair enough, but why does something like Revantusk exist? Does the original patch number mean nothing to what Blizzard puts in a "phase"?
---
I would bring it up at the next blizzcon. Cheers
---
I disagree with your assessment.
---
cant really argue with you on that.
---
but ill try :3
---
you can go to the site, download the files in the zip, and see that its just the lua and toc files. those who can open it with a word editor and read it can see that all it does is pull experience data and calculate values based off that.

I just want to play the game with some real people. Feel free to message me on here or pst me in game my toons name is Starbaby.  Thanks!
---
Open world?
---
How many mobs would that be? How many level 60s homies would I need to bring to beat this challenge?
---
Ide imagine it would take a substantial amount of mages to AOE them all down. Maybe an equal amount of shamans spamming chain heal.
---
Blizzard has said layer abusing is very minimal and in problematic. They said they have several solutions but haven’t needed to use any so far. As for those racing to 60 and abusing.. they are only ruining their own experience don’t let it get you down
---
I think the goal was get the game out as if firat and wait a few months minimum before even thinking about making any additions or changes. I personally would love a guild bank but am willing to deal with managing a guild bank alt or two with the guild officers.

It says the roll type in the order they rolled. The actual roll numbers are not always in that order. In the screenshot the OP was clearly last to roll because theirs is the last roll type logged before the roll took place.

I'm playing WoW, I'm simply patient enough to wait to be in a good server unlike the single-player experience low pop servers offer.

So this is what people were talking about, someone mentioned it on horde that this happened.

---
You should be spam casting searing pain in order to get aggro off of the tank and help him take less damage. 
---
... no, not really.
---
Its funny though
---
Okay mate, i never once commented on his army service and hes a greater man than i for serving BUT buying gold damages the game thats why its a scumbag move OP also stated they bought it before serving so it doesnt absolve them from making a shit  decision to purchase black market gold.

Way to jump to conclusions, you need to work on emotional restraint my friend. Best of luck.

Less than I would like, I’m sure

I always imagined they were just a lump of flesh after I fight them and their hands didn’t remain intact. Lol

I think you'll be good bro. I started playing WoW after my second deployment to Iraq in '05 and it actually helped me cope with my PTSD when I got home. Use it to remind yourself of better times and perhaps as a way to recapture part of who you are that you thought was lost.
---
Fellow minimalist brother: you don’t need to have spells without CDs on your visible bar! The are CDs all you actually need to see. In fact I’ve considered a CD tracking addon and hiding all bars, but for whatever reason I can’t go that far.
---
There are other places you can put your energy
---
Vanilla had a shop.
---
Oh yeah that’s what I meant. You can dungeon tank on a paladin, no problem.
---
Lol at a warrior pretending to kill people

---
It's not incorrect to do the traditional void dot and wand, its just slower. It comes down to personal preference. Once you hit upper 30's to low 40's the difference does become pretty pronounced though.
---
I’m on it !
---
they bout to have a twosome.
---
lmao, that was me: Wulfkine, human warrior
---
Your outfit was fabulous bro
---
Which server is this?
---
That particular bracer is a top 3 Twink choice but the real question is how many lvl 29 Twink warriors are there? Demand is probably fairly low. It's not BiS, it's probably 2nd but warrior twinks are meh
---
Wulfkine
---
 Our big 2 attack table modifiers are Redoubt and Holy Shield both offering 30% additional block each to a total of 60%. That sounds amazing...but their is a downside.... we need to be critically hit to activate redoubt (receive a 200% dmg hit to protect us from 150% damage crushing blows). Meaning that reliably we can only achieve a consistent 30% modifier with holy shield. If we have gone to the effort of stacking defense to reduce the critical strike chance, then we give ourselves 0% chance to get that additional 30% to save us from crushing blows. (Starting to see the flaw here?)  In addition we don't have any on cool down defensive abilities for when things get really nasty. 
---
**Our hit table with Holy Shield + Redoubt Active + no defense**
---
Miss4.4%
---
Dodge2.98%
---
Parry4.4%
---
Glancing Blow\*\*0 %
---
Block64.4%
---
Critical Hit5.6%
---
Crushing Blow15%
---
Ordinary Hit3.216% 
---
 As you can see from this hit table even with both abilities active. We still need to gain enough defense or raw % dodge/block/parry to gain 18-23% to project us from those nasty blows, and we need to do it without gimping our threat generation. That jumps to 48-55% if you remove Redoubt procs. 
---
This should make it clear why paladins have a rough time with regard to tanking and why realistically they can't main tank raids. They are too vulnerable to single target raid bosses. But this doesn't mean you are useless in a raid just that you require a change of mentality.
---
There are lots of trash mobs you can tank, especially when it comes to AoE and times you can off-tank and many times you can do this waaaaay better than a warrior. My personal preference is to not become crit immune and use Redoubt as a safety buffer. Balancing just enough defense with +block/+parry/+dodge to leave a 2-3% chance to crit, that when happens causes the 30% block from redoubt to be enough to make me crit and crushing immune, giving my healers chance to top me up before the next burst. Without the race to get so much defense you have plenty of option to slide in +spll dmg and +int gear which you desperately need.
---
Besides not everything in raids is a boss (counts as lvl 63), removing crushing blows from the table and putting you up their with the best of them and making us gods at AoE tanking. Here, lack of defense cap isnt an issue and we can reliably prob redoubt without taking heaps of damage becoming defensive power houses and holding agro on loads of targets.
---
From one pala to another, leave them pesky raid bosses to the them warriors, the're better equipped. Know your place, spec accordingly and focus on showing your raids where we shine. When you get deeper into raiding and progress, you can maybe look at tanking those raids that are on farm when you and your guild out gear them slightly.
---
Davante Adams letting my fantasy team down.
---
Tldr?
---
For me it seems to happen when I'm looting.  Its super weird, because I would expect it to actually kick me off the server
---
I'm under the impression that skills/spells you buy from class trainers are independent of the "talents" tree. When you respec it wipes your talent tree clean. 
---
Of course I don't know how it works with spell casters
---
Y’all need Jesus

No shit but neither was the game you played unless it was ultima online, and even if you did there was still online muds you simpleton.

As a hunter I love doing this while hidden somewhere off in the distance 
---
Just watch the panic take over
---
Or if I'm going to be in the area and want to keep track of rogues.
---
Yeah, I mean back in classic, we originally fought just to fight, just for the fun of it.
---
perfect thanks, no idea why I didn't think of an addon to begin with I just assumed there was a hidden interface option.
---
Give it a year, it’ll say level 60 boost
---
Your username is fitting for an Arugal player ;)
---
You must be one of the 2 on the list, judging by your comments i am correct.
---
&gt;In addition, "hash" in this context makes absolutely no sense.
---
As much as I'd like to agree with you, "hash" *does* make perfect sense in this context. The addon is hashing a list of strings, then sending the resultant value to other users of the addon for comparison. Without a hashing step you'd have to send the entire list of 50 strings, which is obviously less desirable than sending a stringified integer.
---
100% not in paladins case. Druids have a chance, it has been seen in vanilla and pserver, but main tank will be too iffy for progression. One thing they have that paladin does not. A super important part. Rage over mana
---
Bingo.
---
I absolutely love how engaged the Classic WOW team is with the community. Their communication is really on-point and I and very well pleased. I hope it stays this way. Kudos Blizzard. I’m having a blast playing btw.

They're just re-using code that already exists in the main client for the paid transfers.  Chill your bollocks.

It gives you access to the free transfer.

Fuck you and fuck the game. It's not real. The fact that you think it's ok to insult a veteran over a fucking game and call him a scumbag because it damaged your little make-believe reality is revolting. You are pathetic.

Only reason people started chillin' in SW is because of the Ony buff.

At least that's why I started chilling there on the private servers.

Disengage doesn't leap backwards in classic
---
So that's 5 extra damage per tick on your 25 tick drain life.  What are you fighting that 3 mobs are only doing 10dps each to you?
---
No idea, most servers have more horde so that would be my guess.
---
Thats just how people work. Always. There’s only so many things to talk about and since what’s next is something nobody knows for sure it’s a topic that can be infinitely rehashed on Reddit

Well damn. Only issue I've had with this layering is if I invite my husband to my group, I can't see him, and he can't see me, even though it shows us right next to each other. But if he invites me, we can see each other.
---
Hi! You won't be tanking on raids at all due to a lack of a hard taunt or aggro-generation abilities. In the optimal raid setting, you'll mostly be a support class - managing buffs and healing with the added bonus of having more survivability than the other healers.
---
Watching him reap what he sowed? NTA. Fearing all the mobs he ever tags to make him get swamped and prevent him farming there? YTA.
---
The second is related to another post a couple days ago not you.

Did you or him check dps? Warlocks do crazy damage at that level. Mine is 23 and no one is even touching my dps and I do the same thing as you.

Same.  Appears mods are removing posts mentioning this.  Are the mods here tied to Blizzard? Mine was removed earlier as a “repost” - but I couldn’t locate a similar post anywhere until yours.  
---
This is just the first step.  They get the “SHOP” button put on and familiar.  “But it’s harmless because the only thing in it is free!”. Then before you know it they are nickel and diming the classic community for every paid option they can think of.  
---
We all knew it was coming.  It’s not a surprise at all.  Just amazing how quickly it’s happening.
---

should i stick with fire or switch to frost? lvl 34 mage right now, after every pull for a duengon im always oom. how are the mana problems for frost? i like big crits and since everyone else is going frost might as well go fire but my mana issues are so bad. my damage is pretty good but i run out of mana quick and my tank never wants to wait for me to drink
---
Not the asshole, that's an idiot paladin.
---
Just why have you typed this haha
---
we know
---
In original vanilla my brother and I kept a list of those who wronged us. We kept it for years and had a number of opportunities over the course of vanilla, bc, and wrath to avenge ourselves. 
---
Wish I knew what happened to that piece of paper.
---
Great plays, great song and love the cackle at the end lol
---
Wow how is that done?
---
Give the woman a break already, first she carries you for 9 months now you’re making her carry you thru dungeons as well?
---
No, you don't need to rebuy the ranks. If you haven't get the talent and buy the upgrades, then respect and DON'T take the talent, yes you will lose it. But if you respec again and take the talent you will have the version that's upgraded all the way to whatever you've bought.
---
I wonder if my alt Piggy would get an invite.
---
I tank as fury pre 45, more damage=more rage=more threat, plus getting hit more generates even more rage. what i’m talking about is hybrid classes literally needing on every item and thinking it’s okay
---
The porn subs ya goof!
---
Play the mall, go between them, enjoy them all, get none of them to 60, wait until the leveling process is speeded up in BC or even in Wrath before you get any maximum level characters, just have fun
---
We tried to give our cat wet food and she just drinks the juice from it and leaves the rest. We just share tuna with her now. 
---
Also just make sure her bikkie bowl and water bowl are full, she eats a few bikkies at a time whenever she feels like it.
---
I way prefer this because I'm super forgetful. Even with decent routine I'll still forget stuff, so being able to top it up immediately whenever I see it getting sorta low suits me perfectly.
---
I leveled with drain tanking in vanilla and never could for the life of me understand why people used the voidwalker. Nice to see that people agree with me 15 years later.
---
i mean he did have a point, it was only a consideration because its Quinn.  no one would ever consider giving some random ret a BRE first week lol.
---
Damn azeroth is a tiny place.
---
Is that the e-sports legend known as Northern?
---
I'm working on getting this on my hunter. Congrats!
---
You really don't make much money while leveling both tailoring and enchanting, in fact with that plus your abilities you will usually be low on gold.
---
Jesus christ man i have nothing against op i know nothing about them besides the post my comment is about the fact that buying gold is a scumbag move im not saying he personally is a scumbag but the move its self is and in that moment he was for doing so. 
---
Youre reading to far into this and are to emotional to have a conversation with i hope you can work on that seek the support of friends/family because theres no way your this angry over a throw away comment, honestly.
---
Underrated comment
---
Gratz
---
I hope by now everyone should know that in vanilla this varies with servers. Some call in exclusively vc while others dm. The only wrong answer is “Everyone in vanilla calls it vc/dm”.
---
because it's not a single player game
---
Used a quest item the other day and it had that image for the cast bar, made me chuckle
---
Yeah, so... if it was because they are well geared from raiding, I just have zero desire to do that. I will stick with PvP and 5-man content. 
---
If that means shaman isn’t a good option, then I will go Druid for sure.
---
We need more like this!
---
NoChAnGeSsssss
---
its time consuming mostly. I'm 4 days in and only 39. Dam fishing.....and cooking........and first aid....Oh! more free leather over there.
---
You wanna talk about gaming addiction problems? I was playing competitive Overwatch while walking 4 alts to the nearest inn/mailbox to use as bank alts while I level my main (was doing this between loading screens, respawn and queue times times), and THEN I was fishing on my main while continuing to play Overwatch.
---
the quests there are really good, if you manage to not die. Today I went there after getting camped at STV and got most of the shimmering flats quests done without dying once
---
So what do druids provide in a PvP setting that isn’t WSG? Heals only?
---
If it wasn't exploitable now, there would be no need for these "additional controls".
---
I can't even blame the guy for doing it though. If my goal was to get world first lvl 60, I'd do the same thing.
---
I blame blizzard for not coming up with an actual solution to an _obvious_ problem.
---
You mean loli-hop?
---
Tbh im almost 60. Im hoping to take advantage of that and farm rare materials to make a ton if gold.
---
I play a shaman so instead of ganking them I just purge them :-)

Apparently I’m neither
---
With 5/5 imp drain life, at level 36 (rank 3 drain life I believe) it’s 32 life per second + whatever spellpower adds. Plus two or three siphon life dots add up
---
Our opinions truly don't matter in this, some people enjoy the game while multiboxing and the weird interactions they can do with it. Blizzard has known it's gone on for years and has done nothing to stop it. This shows to at least some degree they are fine with this style of play. That's the end of the argument.
---
Further proving the theory of conservation of rage.
---
Do you get a lot of use out of that in PvP (or even PvE) or is it just fun for harassment?

Next time, you can hold CTRL and clicking to manually do it instead of turning it off

Why don't you just macro /startattack into something instead of having it on your bars??
---
That not even a little bit true. Just because there's no evidence it's been exploited and no known path for exploitation doesn't mean there's no reason to add additional safeguards. If at some point someone *does* discover an exploit they hadn't anticipated, it's better for them to have as many tools at their disposal as possible.
---
r/woooosh
---
Classic is already hard mode. It's partly why people wanted Vanilla back.
---
That you wasted time
---
you're tearing this party aparrrt!
---
I can’t say for sure. Everyone I pvped with in vanilla was very well geared so don’t have much to go off from personal experience there. I would do some googling to  see how gear dependent they are.
---
I'll help people who have got in over their heads accidentally, but if I see someone deliberately pull like a moron they're on their own. Only way they'll learn.
---
I'm the opposite. I screenshot every horde I kill.
---
Yeah there is, but more often than not it happens in groups of people who have already gotten together and made gills or at least introduced each other and formed groups. You got to do that
---
The day I re-subbed for WoW Classic after 6 year I got a free 100 level boost for modern WoW. Ironically the lack of meaningful progression was what drove me away in the first place.
---
If I ask a mage for water and he asks for money, I don't bother with him. 
---
If I ask a mage for water and he opens trade, he gets 10s per stack.
---
It's only fair, conjuring water is annoying in classic.
---
Its an invasion of privacy to know if a stranger added ME to THEIR friendlist? Cus 99% of other online games require the other person to accept a friend invite, just not WoW.
---
Eat shit methhead
---
I understand that, however a lot of people obviously play both considering they are just different versions of the same game.
---
They are probably resisting Growl.
---
Omg yes! I’ll update pic tomorrow (if I figure out how.. :/)
---
Its probably very simple to tally every time a layer change event occurs on a user. Look at layer changes per hour and investigate the outlying players would be very easy.
---
Why does my screen look nothing like this
---
Maybe not on low pop servers but any server that currently has a que would have a 2-5x longer one without ques.
---
If it wasn't in Vanilla, it won't be in Classic.
---
Phase 3 wait in line
---
I think the design of the end-game makes this impractical. People are encouraged to rush to 120 because each raid only lasts a patch, if you don't get to it in time it becomes outdated and nobody is interested in running it.
---
Uther!!! I was there too (horde).  Classic is fun, the community feel is pretty nice.  It definitely can be addicting if you let it.
---
My drain life ticks for 39 each second right now. And at the beginning of the fight my health dips, but as the mobs drop 1 by 1, especially on mobs that start running away, the health gain turns positive.

Just throw it up on github and post the link online.  People will be able to download, test and modify it.  When you get enough sheckles together to pay for a sub, you can test it yourself and accept any pull requests you might have.
---
My friends and I planned on doing that but his guild that he played private servers with (and I did too) decided not to switch because like 5 people got to lvl 20 the first night. So now I'm missing out playing with them. Blizzard really screwed it up imo.
---
You have a mass server with multiple mini servers going on in it. ( think you make a game based in Brooklyn New York and everyone in the world is playing, you cant have everyone in the same place beacuse the way it's set up you would cause over population, so you have built mulitiple brooklyn. You want to join someone you know so you find out that they are at your favorite coffee shop, centeral perk. You go there, they are now where to be found!!!you join their group and you are suddenly standing in the same place! (You dont know if you joined their "layer" or they joined your layer" . The worry is you could pick what layer  you are in; Have friends in different layers,  you can cash in on a node multiple times without having to wait for respond time.
---
My brother switched at level 40.  Now he has a level 20 something mage. I also respec’d into disc because I wasn’t gonna be solo leveling, under his advice. Then I had to respec shadow because he went and made a new character
---
I don’t know if you’ve tried aoe farming as a mage, but all the aoe spots are over farmed by however many layers there are. I can switch layers to every single layer and see 2 mages at Goshek instead of 2 total mages. Seems logical to assume that resources would be similar.
---

Oh yea also that :s

Do you think the deeprun tram smells like piss just like real life subways do?

Oh shit, snap.
---
I played warrior for 15 years straight, but this I figured with a fresh beginning and long levelling process I'd ban myself from warrior; played a hunter instead.
---
I know it’s an unpopular opinion around here but I completely agree. The only thing they have “done wrong” is underestimating the amount of ppl coming back for classic.
---
This dude random invited me at north shire.
---
I feel like he’s fairly obvious when you can see his hip to waist ratio? I’m not curvy at all and my ratio is still more.
---
&gt;However, we also want to assure you that the issue is a much smaller problem than some people are claiming.
---
"The issue" (aka the exploit) is *smaller* than people think. Not even Blizzard is claiming there is *no* exploit.
---
Classic is great for its own reasons, but for a LOT of people, its way too flawed overall. The mechanics are... rusty, to say the least. 
---
Like retail and classic are two entirely opposite ends in terms of streamlining and difficulty. A lot of people would probably prefer somewhere in the middle (although likely closer to classic...)
---

I'm a veteran too and we get treated like shit far too often for me to not be outraged over some little pissant making a stupid comment. The guy put himself out there and you spit on him. Disagree all you want with him but you made the call to insult him without hesitation or consideration and I have zero patience for little shits-stains like you who have no comprehension of what guys like us experienced and sacrificed. Yet you feel entitled to insult him because of something he did in a fantasy videogame.
---
His name is sneaky
---
So this is only available to high pop servers with a queue? What's going to happen to low pop servers once the population levels out? Will I have the option to transfer to a realm with a better population or will they be merging realms?

Just go. Can’t you see we don’t want you anymore?

Yes. Flight paths will take terribly inefficient routes if you don't have the correct connecting path, so this just shows which flight points you need to ensure you arrive quickly and inexpensively.

You still autoflag in enemy territory. Just not in contested.
---
Try playing a caster, resist all day while you get whooped.
---
There was a bunch of jank and problems in vanilla period, as part of the experience.
---
Layering wasn't in classic, the new raid frames weren't in classic, there wasn't a button to end your flight at the next stop in classic. There have been changes where necessity supersedes purity. Why would guild vaults not fit into that category?
---
Calling Asmon a community leader is hilarious.
---
well no that is in your talent tree..
---
Dont grind and just continue leveling as normal imo, questing gives decent g/h and you gain a lot more xp that way, saving you time in the end.
---
Search for addon “classic cast bars”. Dunno if its the best but works fine for me
---
Depends on if you’re horse or alliance. I typically find the most Tin in Westfall and Loch Modan. It’s abundant in most lvl 15-30 areas
---
noob question (new to vanilla), which items could use a hunter to gain speed? today I had a weird encounter when me as a druid in feral form with speed talent couldn't catch the hunter even with dash and he was actually faster than me.
---
He was a hunter level 32, me a druid level 31.
---
Wat sucks , I hit 21 and rolled a mage and I live my mage.  Now I have two 21's.
---
Shy-Rotam. She's not better than other cats, but she's a rare skin.
---
Should've left him with Loktar'ogar
---
I accidentally closed out of the guide in-game and now i don't know how to get it back up, i've tried disabling and enabling both the addons again and exiting the game completely. It's probably an easy fix but would anyone here know how I can get the guide to show back up in-game?
---
Tbh he probably doesn't know what tbh stands for.
---
It didn’t when I tried it. The unit frames were really broken.
---
dat class
---
24 pally, 18 druid, 19 mage, 7 warlock. Yeah I'm about to roll a hunter for the pet. Love it! :D
---
&gt; where TF did you guys learn the term leash? it's a synonym of kite.
---
​Uh. No, it's not. Kite is to keep ahead of a mob. Leash is the mob returning to its patrol/spawn area.
---
yeah apparently company's develop new games to prove a point about how bad it is
---
Just another easter egg. Probably an old Vanilla developer thrown in for shiggles and forgotten about. Nice.
---
I had a warlock putting up 1 dot on mobs and then standing around the rest of the fight. Occasionally he would wand.
---
His dps was below the tank and healer for every single fight. &lt;.&lt;
---
Wow if you have 29 and 22, you must have been playing like at least... 6 hours a day so far?
---
Thanks for the heads up! The source image I was using also does not have this connection.
---
Out of the loop..what promise did he break?
---
If you see him again, tell him that "caster pets" have been fixed. You no longer need to hunt a rare to get a white windserpent with decent stats.
---
I stopped playing after Wrath. What is leveling while dead?
---
I like to imagine all the NPC's hand you tasks and watch you leave. Only to return hours later dragging bags full of all the shit they want, severed heads hung on your belt, covered in blood and they just think fuck thats a badass.
---
Ah right, so there's no mechanic where higher level creatures need more threat from your pet to maintain aggro?
---
Have you read the blue posts? Theyve said they plan on following the classic community and see what we want.
---
Ok, how about if I call him a scumbag for buying gold? I'm a veteran. I've deployed. Being a vet doesn't mean you are impervious to scrutiny for your actions. I wouldn't say he's a terrible person for it, but it's a scumbag move. I appreciate you strong support for vers, but we're not all saints. And yes, there are plenty of vets who are complete pieces of shit.
---
It's not very hard, use r1 concussive shot and cheetah and maybe a manapot or two. Great way to get easy gold. Used to do this all the time and it in no small part paid for my 100% mount.
---
I’m out of the loop. What exactly did he “promise”? And why are they upset ?
---
So, when tanking dungeons, am i supposed to pull the least amount of mobs possible at all times?
---
World of World of Warcraft
---
I second this
---
Why? Pvp is fun endgame. Just don't find it fun to get ganked by rogues while leveling.
---
Look ill break it down, youre correct you guys get shit over nothing and i purposly didnt comment on the service because i have no right to.
---
Anyone who makes a poor decision can be called out for it regardless of thier life experiences i dont mean anything personally with the comment i just mean the act itself is in poor taste and also against ToS of something we all enjoy.
---
Im sure someone as patriotic as yourself could understand abiding laws and regulations.
---
No tank gets full threat automatically...  Warriors and Druids have to jump through a bunch of hoops and tab targeting to hold aoe agro.  Paladins just need Consecration and passive reflective damage, allowing them to focus priority targets.
---
The hype is still there, it's just in game and not here. Come here for the memes, but don't stay for the discussion. Downers will suck you down to their level every time.
---
maybe i bought it from you
---
this has just changed my life, thank you
---
Full MMR reset or riot!
---
You replied to the wrong person, that's been my argument from the beginning. Help me get it through this guy's skull.
---
Do you have a link to your x-perl? The version I found was broken.
---
We did that too vs another raid group of ally for the supply crates. They added the voice chat on prepatch too so everyone was in call messing around.
---
Like that scene when all the hobbits return to The Shire on ponies in ROTK
---
I hope you give him higs and kithiss
---
Yeah, you're right.  This was really probably a business decision.  They wanted to give players something that matched W3, and was themed around the "Creepy crawly" sort've atmosphere that somebody would probably expect from being "Undead"
---
Nope, the opposite is true.  The low level areas are very busy and will likely stay that way for a while
---
Neat! Thanks!
---
Good thinking.

Prob not far off lol

I would say go PVP. It really isn't hard to get your corpse back, worst thing you lose 10 minutes waiting on them to leave or res sick to wear off, and I have waaaaaay more fun world PVP than I ever have on any PVE server.
---
what zone is this server ? Eu?
---
Honestly man, give it a shot. I've found that playing things like wow, or other games I used to play with friends that I lost, has been very therapeutic. Don't get me wrong though. There were plenty of hard, emotional times. But in the long run I think it helped me cope with a lot of my past. You and your life will never be the same as it was before, and that's not a bad thing. You're going to find a new normal. You're going to be ok.
---
As a 32 (now 33!) Warrior who got their axe today and was aided in STV, you're doing the work of the gods and we appreciate you
---
Sorry, I have a habit of not always being entirely clear on initial response.
---
Yes, guild bank is a good idea, but because it wasn't in Vanilla, it's unlikely to be in Classic.
---
BTW No one asked for layering. Blizz did it as a stop-gap to handle server capacity issues, and yes it's shit.
---
Do you really think the word of a company who had to re-release a game on a patch they made 15 years ago to be a relevant game again is the same as a rocket scientist? they had to go backwards 15 years to go forwards, thats a bad rocket scientists.
---
2. i never said skyrim is soulless, just retail wow. what i think is soulless is to play a mmorpg with only the mmo or rpg and not the other 1/2 of the equation.
---
3. Ultimately yes, developers cant force you to play any game the want they want no matter how much they try, thats all there really is to it. its not really that complicated. 
---
But feel free to link me something that has both those topics in there specifically, also im waiting on the link that is the backbone of your entire claim on blizzard (which still doesnt mean jackshit) because Blizzard does not dictate what opinions are fact, nor is blizzard the entirety of MMORPGs.
---
your last comment really weakens your overall arguement, its crude and completely irrelevant since its actively misleading, also on the entire bases that blizzard thinks that how the game should be played, which the burden of proof would be on you to show that.
---
Either of which if you could, would still be localized to WoW only, not MMORPGS in general, because once more Blizzard does not dictate anything except their own game and nothing outside of it, be it opinions, definitions or the right or wrong way to play a game.
---
Thanks

Is pickpocket farming RFD or Cath viable at 40 to earn mount gold?
---
Exactly this.

15.6 1080p
---

---
Aww shit, and for sure, that area is awful, lol
---
While leveling who gives a shit. But if some mage rolls need on dal'rends there be hell to pay!
---
 You're the one giving me alerts for bullshit.
---
Well back in vanilla there was a few quests you could do while dead, a couple of them still exist nowadays. But sometimes you can get XP while you're a ghost during certain quests and events, sometimes it's a bug and sometimes the game gives credit to all nearby group members even ghosts on purpose. Basically, it's not common to level up while dead. But it can happen, mostly from quests like the one in the main post (molten core attunement can be done while a ghost)
---
That's the joke.
---
This x100.
---
Parsec is amazing
---
A good warrior would win. Most do. You sure you know your class?
---
And on that front I will even say the only "right" answer that everyone would have been happy with is if they guessed the exact number perfectly which would be impossible
---
They chose to start with less servers vs more but people who would have been mad either way
---
I don’t understand why people give a fuck what the guy does. If he wants to play classic in a shit way then let him. Who has time to worry about some other dudes problem? Just play the game and don’t pay him any mind if you don’t like the way he’s playing.
---
A healthy mix of both quests and grinding will give you a good set of gear and help you to get 40 without pulling your hair out . Plus you will meet some fun people alo g the way.
---
Your mage looks like a pedo rapist
---
&lt;3
---
19 priest, 18 hunter, 17 warrior, 17 Druid, 13 mage, 7 rogue on one server...
---
16 warlock, 12 hunter, 12 warrior, 11 priest, 10 rogue, 7 Druid, 5 mage on another server.
---
Yes... I’m very familiar with altoholism.
---
Ironman BTW
---
does alliance pvp as much as horde?
---
I think a lot of this is spot on, but transmog and also LFG aren't bad, I think LFG is a useful tool that didn't ruin the game, chopping the balls off of everyone dungeon is what ruined the dungeon experience. I'm a big believer that the biggest thing that took people out of the social aspect of the game is flying.
---
Would like to know as well
---
It has nothing to do with crushing blows and everything to do with single target threat
---
Evocation and spirit enchants and spirit gear make that less of an issue.
---
I think they used to be called Level 60 Elite Chieftain and then they leveled up lol
---
Water elemental becomes wet.
---
Gnomes and human males need to be punished for their mistakes.
---
I don’t mind him only thing that irks me from time to time is that he is the definition of streamer perks
---
Less at a time means that you'll have a higher chance of survival. 
---
More at a time means you can clear the dungeon quicker. 
---
It's up to you and your group where you stand in those two extremes.
---
It's alright, except you gotta be alliance
---
Well I wish you luck! Im not sure if its one of the longer gronds but I've been killing things since tuesday Haha
---
If they were to allow, let alone give free, realm transfers into high pop servers, that would literally defeat the point.
---
Y’all are literally crying about something that’s not even an issue... acting like private server screenshots are classic or something
---
What, that's the Horde.
---
I was the mage after Reku lol
---
You could argue WoW actually saves you money. Go out to the bars? Nah play WoW. Concert? Nah play WoW. I’m joking of course... kind of. But yeah, I have friends who spend $50+/week drinking.
---
It's "flawed"ness that you're highlighting is essentially exactly what we the community wanted back because Retail became paint-by-numbers mode for levelling and gameplay. If people can't handle Classic, go back to Retail.
---
How are people still talking about this? This shit is all you see on Faerlina's sub too
---
They can do both but it's a cost risk assessment.
---
Ckassic+ has my vote.
---
Right? I'm hooked to WoW again as a level 8 dwarf paladin. Fucking absurd.
---
ok. where did you get a working version of this mod? I had 2 bad ones so far

thats amazing
---
I'm by no means putting Asmongold on a pedestal as a community leader but it's fucking hilarious that people keep ragging on him for taking mount money from people. A *massive* percentage of people here would take the money in a fucking heartbeat if it was traded to them and everyone knows it. People are in dreamland on this one.
---
Yep, like the other 15 posts haha super funny!
---
IMO, let them be petty and kick. I'm with the rogues on this one. They have the skill to unlock it, only them, let me make that clear... ONLY THEM. They don't have to open that chest for you, you can't force them, and you aren't entitled to their lockpicking skill. Honestly, if this is how you people are going to be, feeling entitled to someone else's character, then I'm with rogues just straight up never opening locked chests.
---
Also, the guy you are talking to, you are deliberately ignoring what he is saying. A rogue is suppose to share a resource that only they have access to, but miners aren't? Skinners aren't? If there is one rogue and locked chest shows up, he has to share it according to you... But if the group only has 1 skinner, that person doesn't have to share the leather they skin from mobs? That seems biased, like, extremely one sided and biased. That's not consistent at all.
---
Rogues are no more obligated to open and share the contents of a locked chest than anyone else is required to do so. If a blacksmith has a key, is he required to open that chest and share the contents with you?
---
Nice ^(Nice) *^(nice)*
---
I want to be lvl 60 forever hands down.
---
They can release new content, new spelks, and new areas without raising the level cap.
---
Raising the cap is what every mmo ever has gotten wrong.
---
I actually agree with everything you said, my comment sounded cooler before I thought it out lol.  First thing I leveled in Legion was a DH so I was immediately over them sacrificing everything.
---
The problem with Layering and why some people are "hopping" is the faction balance is completely broken...
---
I had one layer where STV was ltierally 90% horde and barely any alliance... a friend invited me to his group, i got ported to a different layer and it was the complete opposite, alliance everywhere with no horde.
---
Instead of fixing "hoppiing" they need to fix layering itself.
---
He is set to passive and macro set to only attack the target I am attacking :)
---
&gt; and few people explore off the path shown them
---
I mean I think that's a personal choice. I'm personally using Questie as mostly a vague compass in the right direction, though many quests make it clear enough from the text. I'm already doing tons and tons of running back and forth between towns, even flights when I have the money to spare, so if I had to do even MORE running because I didn't even have a clue where I was going I'd probably get burnt out instead of having fun. I'm still plenty enjoying exploration on my own, as the game is designed to favor it both a bit of direct xp and just general incentives with new quests and off the beaten path recipes and whatnot. Though it wasn't much in the way of actual money one of my favorite things has been finding random chests in places dense with enemies or just geneally out of the way. For instance Darkshore has random washed up supplies you can check, and even an island with no real purpose to visit had a pleasant surprise of a chest to loot if you bothered to explore that far. There's also the fact of the matter that a lot of quests arbitrarily unlock at certain levels even if there is no quest chain prerequisite, meaning that without Questie I could easily run by an NPC, even multiple times, that DOES have a quest but just not right now.

Isnt it more about how fringe players go crazy and min max to the nth degree by doing like mob tag layering between groups or something screwy like that? It's not bags full of black lotus. It's people getting 11.1% (repeating of course) better XP by spell cleave farming layer tagging dungeon clearing powerquesting?
---
All I see is people doing dungeons over and over on Twitch and I’ve been questing the whole time. 
---
Am I doing it wrong? Should I be doing dungeons instead of endless questing that sends me all over the map?
---
Can confirm. Warlock is a ton of fun having insta cast dots and timing casts/Wands with refreshing your dots. Timing them right is a great feeling b

What I mean is this.

LFG is arguably one of the most damning contributors to killing the social atmosphere.

Brack said it himself when "all you have to do now is click a button". It literally removes the socialization, even if it's just as small as someone asking for an invite.

100% could do in vanilla.

No.

But also wouldn't it just be SSJ2?

I play night elf and mostly stay in Kalimdor so yes I've seen the map! There isn't even a direct flight from Ashenvale to Theremore it's terrible!

I loved suramar, but really? They couldn't add a couple more random "suspicion" quotes?

Isn't the point of guards to deter low level players from being ganked in starting areas/low level quest hubs?

How do you know he didn’t log out or alt f4 or joined a group just before he got into pvp combat?
---
I levelled several characters up to level ~70 before the Cataclysm and after that the level boosts started and brought momentum for me to a dead stop. What was the point anymore?
---
My played is higher than would be due to me avoiding logging out when I'm coming back I'm 15 minutes etc. I'm not about to sit through a 1 hour queue because I had to take a shit.
---
I wish my wife played wow haha that’s awesome!
---
I'm always of the opinion that if you plan to use an item (and not as some sort of meme build like hunters that roll on +healing for pets), then you have absolutely every right to roll need on it.
---
make that into a macro?
---
Honestly. I can’t believe people are getting salty because the server they chose is made for this specifically! Why did he kill me? STFU!
---
Work is 40hrs/week, school I usually spend maybe 15-20hrs a week.  Wow time is usually my lunch break at work and a couple hours after I put the kids to sleep on nights my wife works late.  When I was 23years old playing wow a few months after release, I'd play most of my 3 day weekend straight...dem were the days.....
---
2handers aren't great for any raid class so they are pvp rolls, of which arms makes best use of them.
---
Loot will likely be assigned and distributed on a precedent/need basis. Many guilds I imagine will use DKP, so loot will be given out to those who contribute the most/who need it the most.
---
man, tagging along with yall yesterday was a blast
---
So wait, you make it sound like the greens worth 20 silver are a trivial decision to be "greedy over." But doesn't that make the 20 silver worth of greens a trivial reason to not play with someone over? Do you see the problem here? You say the items should be trivial so that he shares them, but if they are trivial than what does it matter? Why do you care so much about the 20 silver worth of greens when he shouldn't?
---
Best comment of the thread
---
Yes, exactly. I use the same method to feed my pet as hunter
---
Right. Mine RIOTS and will try to knock anything off my desk, will try to knock pictures off walls, and yowl like he's a poor lost baby. There is no forgetting him. The dog encourages the behavior because he gets fed when kitty gets fed.
---
I think classic is just as harsh or maybe even worse than BFA for alts. Any altitis I get ends when I get on an alt to level them.
---
either monkeyquest or modern quest watch.
---
The rush to end-game where "the real game starts." Which I call bullshit. I've had more interactions and adventure in 8 levels than I did in the entirety of BfA.
---
Lame

/startattack before basically any ability as a warrior. It's annoying trying to right click some guy because you're out of rage and your dude is just standing there getting his ass beat like an idiot.
---
Would you mind explaining how duplicating resources does not affect the economy? I assure you that I've thought about this for a minimum of four seconds.
---
Quests hubs get destroyed by HIGH-level characters.
---
Ever notice how towns spawn different-level guards? Some 40, some 55, and some (I think) just 30? That was to encourage world PvP. It's a balance between weak enough to be killed by low-level players, and strong enough to pose a threat to a max-level character who feels like killing NPCs.
---
Low-level characters SHOULD be able to attack quest hubs.
---
The "little bit of googling" you did would've gotten you information from years ago, when all servers were abundant with 60s and stage content, so unless you can specify the sources of that info and how old it is, I'd say it's not reliable to compare for Classic right now.
---
So he promised to not take gold from other players until he got his epic mount. On day 2 (I believe) he broke that promise.
---
Not an issue, you're flat out wrong about the impact it has on low level pvp and you clearly didnt play back in the day if you think this ever deterred low level wpvp.
---
Or surely to give you a safe zone where the opposite faction can’t hurt you
---
Absolutely agree. Some of the flight mounts in the game are beyond sick to look out, but I think the ability to auto fly a straight line to any point on the map really killed the social scene, as well as world pvp.
---
My cat will actively knock water out of the bowls and plays in it till it's gone. I can refill and clean up water 5 to 7 times a day.

Which one is the US streamer server? Pls dont be Faerlina
---
As a paladin I can roll on all “warrior” shit and I know it drives tanks nuts but I don’t really give a fuck, I can heal,tank, or dps in dungeons while leveling and just because I’m healing doesn’t mean I’m not going to roll on that sweet 2 hander that just dropped. Luckily I haven’t had any tanks bitch at me yet.
---
Kinda what I figured... oh well. Maybe I can turn a small profit down the road.
---
Yojamba is the best. It’s populated as many who couldn’t stand the ridiculous early queues in arugal moved there. So now there is a very healthy population with almost no queues.
---
It's the best and most defensible location, really.

World chat on my server has been taken over by two players named benzin and skaarj who have banned everyone that talked at all. This has happened twice :/

That or they're trying to get a lesser populated instance to farm a quest or item

I am not asking for a transfer to Arugal. I would like the option to transer to a low pop Oceanic server. 
---
I have the option to transfer from a Pacific to Pacific server only.
---
Wow... thats enough reddit for today
---
And shot callers
---
Well, more often it's to protect quest givers with the low-level areas, since they're not contested zones. But they do that just as effectively with this change. A lvl 60 character won't see any resists when attacking a lvl 40 guard, whether or not that guard uses the player resist table or the mob resist table. But a new player on a lvl 25 character who goes along on a raid to see what this "world PvP" thing is all about will certainly notice the difference.
---
Amongst my friends I was one of the biggest spenders on transmog and loved hunting weird looks and completing old sets, but I think it's a become a huge crutch for Blizz's artists and item designers. An admission that they no longer put the effort into creating useful and flavourful items. Of course that job gets ever harder with a 10+ year backlog of memories to compete with, so I don't want to put them down too much, but transmog allows them to not even try.
---
In Classic, when I see someone wearing Whirlwind Axe or Giantstalker Armour, I know what that means. I know what they've done, I know how strong they are, I might even know what kind of player they are. In retail, I know that means they think it looks cool. I don't remember any of the item names or looks from Legion (the last time I was subbed to retail), in part because I was transmogged to Dragonstalker the entire time.
---
Transmog remedies the fact that Blizz is hampered by trying to make everything "balanced" rather than cool. Every next item in Legion had to be precisely 2% better than what you were wearing so there was never really much choice or flavour. You never had a huge power spike when you picked up Blackhand's Breadth, or did that class quest or whatever other milestone.
---
There's barely any or no queue between 23:00-16:00 (next day) server time right now. It would only make sense, people have had their off days and are actually working rn.
---
It’s relevant, controversial news with a decently wide audience that gets the pot stirred. Just relate it to regular media. This’ll be dead in a few days.
---
Had to try, rip, actually have to play the game now...
---
Not everyone has mining, or herbalism, or skinning... So if we all prosper together, shouldn't every miner, skinner, and Herbalist also share the mats they get from the dungeon? If the rogue has to share his locking picking, shouldn't the only skinner in the group have to share the leather he skins? After all, he is opening up more doors right? Be a team player, share that Iron deposit.
---
If you start at level 1 and take it slow read what you're supposed to be doing you'll be fine. 
---
I find when new people tag along with current players who know every quest etc off by heart they can get lost easier as their experienced friend ussually holds their hand. So much that when the newb plays by him self hes completely lost.
---
They don’t sell for a whole lot. Might sell for a bit while demand is high but generally once the server ages, the demand goes down.
---
    /petattack [@mouseover,harm][]
---
There ya go.  If you're moused-over an enemy, it'll send your pet at it.  Otherwise, it'll send your pet at your current target.
---
In classic we're basically just murder hobos and npcs keep us busy with quests so we don't slaughter everyone.
---
I think some people may see him as the "face" of WoW in the streaming community, so they have strong feelings regarding his behaviour as they see it as representative of WoW as a whole.
---
Never been really into streamers though, that's just my take on it.
---
MODS: please remove an posts that dox players in servers designed (and clearly fucking labeled) to kill opposing factions. 
---
Do we want shitposts stating “ so and so killed me while I was resting after a kill” every minute?
---
what's the party frame mod called?
---
I could carry both with me if it's this kind of situational
---
I've heard a lot of people are going to Arcanite Reaper. Should be banging.
---
It’s incredibly easy to do off roles with other trees while leveling
---
today i saw a customer open a ticket to install WOW Classic on a company machine... not joking. of course it was not allowed and ticket was canceled lmao! There is now an email going around between employees (who play wow) talking about that ticket :D

---
Hey xylotism, was wondering how you got XToLevel to only show Kills, Quests and Dungeons on Titan Panel? Mine shows a lot of other types of data, such as battles, gathering and digs and it's really crowding my bar.
---
Frost is better early then fire but that's just for an easier time kiting mobs. Mana is always a problem for mages until late game. Tell you're tank to fuck off and wait for you. You could spam wand and save mana but all the mages DPS is from abilities. Think about it, you spam abilities and kill mobs 10 seconds quicker, or you save mana and drink less but kill pulls slower. I personally kill pulls as quickly as possible and then drink and I feel dungeons go quicker that way.
---
As a mage I like to fire blast mobs as I run by
---
U Aggro them and someone else kills them and you get like what 10g?
---
You say never worry about shamans but when you see a ghost wolf zooming towards your location on Shimmering Flats...
---
Interface options &gt; social
---
Did you even look in the social settings? It's at the bottom
---
Base stats are the same, like armor, health and dps. The skills they know on game change, as does attack speed (but not dps)
---
They probably based their opinions on the idea that you won't be able to get it by yourself for quite a while after the quest is given to you. If you can get someone to carry you through it, which shouldn't be hard cause people like geared warriors, then you can get it far earlier than any item with similar stats.
---
Thanks for the tip man!
---
Oh he does. But I do not do it immediately. I let him wait an hour or so, so he can find something else to do instead of playing in the big water bowl. He wont' be dehydrated by waiting an hour or two. He's in inside cat with a luxurious lifestyle. 
---
Just saying. The friends cat could completely knock out water and tip the water bowl playing in it and he just hasn't replaced the water.
---
Battlegrounds?
---
I ran into the same problem and just grinded out some easy mobs from 27-30. The centaur in 1k needles were easy kills and dropped great loot. Ide look for some mobs 2-4 levels below you so you can hit more often and take less damage. I was killing 3-4 mobs between downtime easily.
---
I would have tanked dungeons but the only one worth the exp at 27 was BFD and I plan on never stepping foot in that hell hole again. haha
---
Those don't actually have a kit to do this, hunters do
---
You haven't addressed why you didn't start fresh on Felstriker when it opened. You've had ample opportunity.
---
TIL I'm steve :)
---
Ok. I was under the impression that during the layering phase there was an increased server cap to help accommodate for all the people and that blizzard was just banking on enough people to move around/leave during phase one that it would stabilize for phase 2.
---
I disagree that a lvl 25 player would get upset that other lvl 25 players were attacking her quest hub. In general, people complain about unfair PvP, like getting one-shotted by a lvl 60 (or hunted down by a player on a mount when you're restricted to 7 yards per second). A lvl 25 has a chance against other lvl 25 players, even if there are several of them, because of guards (and even quest NPCs who can fight back). Guards should make a fight more even, not make it completely one-sided in favour of the guards.
---
But there's no point in trying to convince you since this is clearly not getting community support. If Blizzard makes this change, it won't be because this post was voted to the top of the list.
---
I just removed the actual panel so it's only text.
---
"They're AWFUL levelers, and they only become top tier dps in full gear, which isnt something you can count on in vanilla. WHY?"
---
According to that private server data warriors in early tier gear were still top dps. If they were topping dps relative to other classes in early tier gear I'd say they don't exactly need top tier dps gear and for a fresh raid group in pre-raid BiS they are also probably already extremely competitive for top dps if not the top dps class.
---
Are serious dude? Did you not look at your interface? haha
---
You can turn it off.  But at least they aren’t spamming trade chat Yet. 
---
Although I do miss seeing the dead Orcs lined up all over the floor to spell out websites.

The proc is great for leveling. Rockbiter is better than Windfury anyways.

basically yes.

Idk if this will gold will help, but I know what it likes to have ‘a day’ and I was lucky enough to have a good one. Pay it forward 🤗
---
i did 4k damage to rag, highest was 58k median was probably 20-30k. i am steve. granted i was only 57 with no hit gear and healers didnt and shouldnt waste mana on me
---
It's 12AM on the East Coast and 9PM on the West. People are going to sleep.

Herpes
---
you'll probably want to jump between loch modan and westfall
---
You have some quests in loch Modan but then quickly get over leveled quests so then head to west fall.
---
I accidentaly Discovery this yesterday in crossroads and was amazed
---
Yojamba and fellstriker opened on launch day bro. Neither of them have queues. You wouldve been on lvl 5 and had the chance to re roll.
---
If they were to follow EQ's lead as planned, you had to very carefully kiss *a lot* of ass for enemy races to like you---[It was essentially comparable to a much more excruciating insane in the membrane](http://wiki.project1999.com/Faction)
---
So I imagine if they had gone that route it wouldn't have been a trivial task.
---
Id say westfall then when you hit 15-16 darkshore then go back to westfall for deadmines
---
Yep. Started Warrior, created a Shaman, a Rogue, a Lock, another Warrior...
---
Help...
---
can confirm. its a level 10-20 zone
---
😕
---
Cool, thanks. I may have to try that.
---
Around 18
---
&gt; You couldn't
---
Of course I could. I've written identical scripts before. Iirc their NPCs are controlled by individual lua script files that allow you to write custom scripts, but I'm pretty sure they already have a maxDistance variable you can just give a value to. These things are trivial.
---
Really? You don't see how having more options at low levels (being able to participate in attacks on towns without aggroing guards from 300 feet away and dying without being able to land a single spell) would encourage people to take a slower, more leisurely approach to the game? Experience rather than destination?
---
Whatareyetalkinabeet
---
There will be people everywhere for s long time except for maybe low servers
---
This guy thinks he can corpse camp a rogue
---
Me and my buddies just made the move after logging off tonight. I don’t think they’re gonna leave. From what I’ve seen searching today most people are pretty adamant they made it clear this was a BR and Latino server. Honestly have no hard feelings and over all everything was good until today (I had a mage ninja loot and not speak any English who also wouldn’t sheep anything, I figured a moon was pretty universal for sheep) but that could honestly happen to anyone so it’s w/e. The queues are the real deal breaker as half our friends are west coast and by the time they get out we’re all getting off. Hope to see more people join us and that Netherwind fills up nicely!
---
What are the robes?
---
I did not even see they opened it. It's a Seperate tab. I premade characters on whitemane on launch day I saw bigglesworth and made my character asap. 
---
Again, still does not matter. I am ok with staying on bigglesworth, but it is not benefitting anyone.
---
Short term definitely. But long term? Nobody can know that. Maybe after the initial dropoff of players (around level 40) playernumbers will increase, meaning demand will rise and the supppy will eventually reduce to end up with regular prices for items that may be too cheap in a month.
---
VapeNation
---
Yes.
---
whys that? :P
---
If there’s one thing Classic has proved, it’s that it may be many things, but not a Vanilla experience
---
if you get attacked in pvp you have no chance of winning though! but cool trick!
---
Nah those are later.  
---
Phase 2 wpvp will be crazy.
---
As a grad student, I can assure you that this definitely isn't true.
---
Ironforge fucks.
---
did this for SM for the illusionary rod lol was healing and my group was 2 warriors a rogue and a hunter :) after losing the roll to people 3-4 levels below being able to equip the staff i started cherry picking
---
Warlocks ftw!
---
Play how you want
---
The only way to know the serve pop is to look at the queues. The queue on earth fury is not meaningful though until that server is removed from a ‘lock’ status and then that would allow all talks to create new characters there.
---
This is why, as hunter, I always have the best quiver/ammo pouch that I can, fill it before a dungeon, and buy 4 more stacks that i transfer to the ammo storage as I expend it. Lowest I've ever gotten was about 5 stacks left.
---
Yeah don’t get me wrong man Whitemane is great and all but jeez even with server transfers open it’s 3300 wait on a Thursday. Lots of my friends can’t play as much as me so I feel bad when I suggested the server and they get home and are hit with a 6k queue lol
---
Idk what all bar harder means, but why should tanking be done with a two hander?
---
Too lazy. Maybe if I get camped lol
---
Eternal Palace has some great fights and some great visuals, but it's also got a lot more pain in the ass fights (Radiance, leviathan) and some missed potential fights (could have done more for za'qul and we waited 15 years to fight Queen Azshara only to get a clusterfuck babysitting wards and focusing on adds.)
---
Ah you sent some tiddies as a goodbye
---
Warlocks hunters and mages are typically the most skilled players I come across..
---
Are you me?
---
When it comes to higher level mobs, you could send your pet in first to attack alone for maybe 3-5 seconds  in order for your pet to build aggro if the mob resists growl.
---
Yo, don't play melee hunter. Better to focus on dps skills like arcane shot, hunter's mark, serpent sting and raptor strike (optional). Wouldn't hurt to get some crowd control like conc shot, wing clip and freezing trap. The rest can be taken later on. Oh and Track Humanoids, if you're on a pvp server, helps with majority of quests as well.
---
I’m alliance on Fairbanks and I just hope more horde transfer to Arcanite Reaper because I plan on staying put
---
Thank you!
---
Arent those mail items?  Shaman cant wear mail in classic...
---
Are you one of those people who believe in chemtrails and that 9/11 was an inside job? Also, using emojis on Reddit, yikes.
---
are the transfers live now?
---
This looks so similar to the UI I ran back in Vanilla, thanks for posting all the addons my dude, I know what I'm setting up this weekend.

It’s possible for something to drop no loot at all, just nothing there to loot 🤷🏽‍♂️

Why would they not add as many as it takes to eliminate ques all together?
---
Yeah I'm struggling with it too. Got a mage to 30 and then made a female orc warrior, leveled to 20. Started thinking I like the male orc animations more, leveled a male orc warrior to 10. Don't know what to do :(.
---
Is it? Sorry i  thought  it was 2.
---
I had no idea that other non caster classes benefit from int. I always make a point to buff healers when I see them though, should change that up to everyone!
---
Is that the same moodle online schools use
---
Thanks everyone.

Anything that costs mana has its ranks shown. Anything that costs energy/rage is immediately updated as the cost never changes (barring talents.)

zperl

OP we have the exact same freakin UI. I use the Perl frames, same positions, same party position.  Same scales. And same bars, three clean centered bars.  I use Dominos on retail, used to be Bongos in classic, haven't used any addons for classic yet though.  But when I do, it will look exactly like this as it has for me for over a decade now

Who cares?

Why would you want to use an ability rank that does less damage for the same resource cost? 
---
It’s not like healing touch where lower ranks have a reduced cast time or mana cost.
---
This is kind of a dumb question.
---
Had a similar issue on Kronos where people would put an irritating amount of time into fishing up nightfin, then selling them at a pretty reasonable price. Actually felt like fishing was worth our time. Then some guy decided his own time wasn't worth shit and started flooding the market at like 30%. Effectively ruined nightfin at what I would consider a loss.
---
Can someone fill me in? What’s layering?
---
For leveling the spirit is far more useful.
---
They’re starting to move in packs now. I think a lot of guilds must have them as KOS
---
More like in 6 months.
---
Someone from the community posted the Bejeweled add-on for classic!
---
Reminds of when the Alliance held a memorial for a guild mate who passed away IRL in Winterspring and, uh, the Horde raided it.
---
imagine having retail installed
---
People who fell for the full bank of crystals are bad at math.
---
For feral Druids: what exactly does Tiger’s Fury do?  Just buff auto-attack damage by 10 per hit?  Does it buff all damage sources by 10?  Does it snapshot on bleeds or something? 
---
Is it even worth spending energy on?
---
Did anyone seriously believe that image? Where would he keep his other items? I also doubt anyone has that much gold yet.
---
They can starting at level 40.
---
Barrens is easily the worst zone in the game. So good news is its all uphill from there.
---
your name is Momma?
---
This was quite funny 😀
---
Read the damn blizzard post. You babies are just freaking out as usual.
---
This is only true of cities.
---
Most likely u if you're already marked before getting the jump the hunter
---
Ok thanks
---
i'm so used to calling them xperl but yeah now they're listed as zperl
---
Ice
---
I hate that place
---
Some guy on the front page yesterday (and today) got his Epic mount.
---
Nice hiss.
---
this is good to know.
---
If you're talking specifically about Classic, then yes, it's a completely different story when it comes to Retail WoW. I mean it still happens, but a lot of the time, the outrage is justified, and Blizzard's responses are unhelpful and condescending.
---
Emergent collusion isn't an offense (ie helping opposite faction members kill a mob in the world), but communicating outside of the game with your friend to purposefully grief people is.
---
That might be because the servers are in totally different data centers and they may not have the system set up to do cross center transfers.  (If they do, I'm unaware of this)
---
That said, sorry you can't be in your preferred region. I rolled PvE to avoid high pop queues for that reason.
---
I gave up when people started to whinge that my underwear wasn't purple enough to team up with.
---
I wouldnt suggest telling a newb who didnt even know how to train skills to play a druid..
---
Don't know who created this, found it online and it's created on Aug 29, 2019, 2 days after classic launch..
---
This is so wholesome
---
Haha friends
---
If you are enjoying hunter you should stick with it dont listen to ppl shit talking classes.
---
Your suggesting my wife cant kill someone with res sickness? Lol
---
This is absolutely amazing. Bravo.
---
The azeroth map transcends WoW, [here's](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/6/6d/Warcraft_III_-_Azeroth.jpg?version=609a5a57e756977a2da9787f20fd4b15) one in wc3
---
In a way I think Classic could allow Blizz to have their cake and eat it too. If you want modern convenience, portals everywhere, linear progressions, great catchup mechanics etc, then BFA is that way and we'll give some level 110 boosts to go with it. If you want to trawl through Classic+ and it's X years of content from the ground up, maybe some catchup in the form of tier 1.5 and a few extra level 60 zones and war effort quests, then you can go do that too.
---
Admittedly, if Classic+ were to eventually get 13 tiers that's an issue, but perhaps they can try a different solution to that issue this time around.
---
Also, the world first kills of Rag and Ony have featured players in greens and under levelled, so that's one catch up mechanic that's missing from modern WoW.
---
法力不足
---
Lol, no kidding. I don't miss that shit *at all.*
---
Harder to feed than other pets though.
---
It was disappointing to miss out on some ability upgrade/new utility, however at level 30 I felt that I had a large majority of my abilities and figured it was an easy way to save some gold. Trust me it sounds a lot harder than it is, most ability upgrades are only small dps increases!
---
Sword spec for the win
---
Man, all these people dinging 60 and I’m just happy hitting 18 tonight
---
K those are 1k in canada wtf man that's a wicked deal.
---
Was also kidding, I'm playing wow on a similar monitor lmao
---
Armor type hardly matters I'm classic, at least at the end. Hell a large majority of bis dps warrior gear is leather/mail
---
sure has a lot of stamina on it lol
---
This is the funny kind madness I've missed for all these years.
---
Did this like 5/6 instanceruns, creating a group is done in 5 minutes since there is so much spread in what level ppl are, got no loot yet though :&lt;
---
Barnabus and Arash-ethis are both rare spawns. You're really better off waiting a couple levels and the skills of a common mob.
---
Nah, they wouldn't throw one of their two biggest unfinished plot threads from Warcraft 3 that early. It would definitely be something following up on the war, and maybe the old gods. they could call it the Battle for Azeroth.
---
All mana is the warlocks mana, it just doesnt know it yet.
---
Proof???
---
All I know is he's got of one those faces that you just want punch....you know you meet someone; and....and, you just have this insatiable feeling of wanting to punch them in the face for no apparent reason. I mean like you can barely know the person, maybe the only exchange you ever had was a slight "suh dude" head nod; but you just have this passionate burn in the deepest catacombs of your heart urging you to lunch them right in the kisser. You know that feeling??? I have that feeling when it comes to asmongold
---
This is why I stay off pvp servers as alliance. My advice is realm transfer when it's available or roll a new toon on pve.  Good luck!
---
The perks of being horde
---
Aye lad, what're we doin' in the tunnels?
---
I like to judge seal of light on targets horde are fighting. So many of them look absolutely confused as to how some random paladin is healing them from the other side.
---
/r/wow is that way -&gt;
---
And World of Warcraft totally died because of this non-issue.
---
I’m a 26 orc warrior and it’s the same for me in every contested zone. Horde seem utterly uninterested in fighting back in general on this server, it’s blowing my mind.
---
As a level 35 Horde mage on Incendius this warms my heart
---
Lmao. Yea. Clearly, Blizzard is at fault here. /s
---
I just grouped with a Hunter today that had never played wow, I had to explain to him the difference between need and greed. He was needing EVERYTHING that dropped.
---
Pro Tip: maybe some things are best kept to yourself
---
Grats! You on Faerlina?
---
coward.
---
You seem like a delight
---
Or do be excessively dickish and farm the tears.
---
If you're alliance, I like the Kurzen camp and cave, you won't be bothered by horde there. Otherwise, you can pick any of the hundreds of troll spots. You can also try the Bloodsail pirates down south but there's usually heavy traffic there.
---
make friends,  quest with them.  punish the horde scum
---
SAME FUCKING THING HAPPENED TO ME.
---
Two runs in a row, shaman took the Robes of Arugal and then next run Feline Mantle (then the lvl 20 lock took the Robes but I feel less bad about that). Motherfuckers' reasoning was "it has str/agi!" fuckers are worse than hunters I swear.
---
Also: we are watching you
---
how good? I am level 21 rank 2 stealth, combat talents only and level 18 enemies will still detect me. It's frustrating. Never played a rogue in classic.
---
They must picture the person on the other end grabbing their monitor violently and screaming, "No! NOOO! I! WHA! HOW! FFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUCK!!!!"
---
No it's not, especially not on a pvp server.
---
Charge. Blood rage switch to zerk stance MS. WW back to arms for overpower procs. Ez mode.
---
I don’t see the issue. Everyone knows the shortest distance between 2 points is a giant upside down V shape going through a third point half a continent away.
---
Same server different instances. You and another person can be in the same place and not see each other. It’s to reduce over-crowding. Especially in starter zones for performance and QOL
---
Love his Mario maker series
---
The majority of people who hung around Moon Guard's Goldshire inn actually were not server residents, you're correct. It's essentially a tourist attraction.
---
Seems like a waste of a keyboard. Everyone knows hordies arent even smart enough to use an Atari 2600 single button joystick.
---
make the modifier alt!
---
Even better, /lay then do this. Or do it while dancing. Iv laughed way too much at the /lay version.
---
Always wished they had done an expansion that was set entirely in a giant underground dwarven city. We're talking regular expansion-sized zone, but it's all "indoors," maybe deep inside the world.
---
You guys must really like some cox.
---
How do pets work? Like how do you get them
---
Join a guild with a lot of active members, that will make forming a group easier. And join the Looking For Group chat channel in game.
---
Changes, no changes, I don’t give a fuck. Just find it funny that of all things, you cry about something that’s really good in the game.
---
Ahh didn't know that, thanks
---
OK, just giving you the best option since what you're attempting in the screenshot won't work.  The '@' modifiers don't work that way, and you can't target totems by name with a macro.
---
Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan!
---
Keep those kills coming, fam.
---
Unsung heroes are still heroes.
---
not yet, not everyone has friends to help them farm all the materials.
---
I just want to see my heals on other people. Apparently that is too much to ask for.
---
You cared enough to comment.
---
I played a shaman to 34 then rerolled to lock, beat decision I ever made
---
lol should hear the streamers from APES talk sometimes. They are mad about things that pserver got wrong and going 'it shouldn't be like that'. A massive amount of hutthurt.
---
I see you've grown as a player
---
Where have you provided the pic?
---
You have bags full of devilsaur? Bags? Can you prove this?
---
Nah neither can I. 
---
What bothers me is that these smaller communities (first to 60 racers) within the greater community of WoW got completely cheated. I always loved following the progress of the fastest leveling players when new servers got released, only to have the rug pulled out from under the community.
---
So the typical attempt of spreading mass hysteria and hate from random players which people will take the word of instantly gets smacked into the ground by the devs.
---
&gt;"The issue" (aka the exploit)
---
These terms are not equivalent, full stop. The wording makes it clear that while purposefully switching layers to game spawns is something they'd like to address, they don't consider it an "exploit."
---
"... to **further** restrain layering from being exploitable," meaning it's *already* restrained from being exploitable. Also remember that "exploit" is an established term, in the sense that knowingly taking advantage of one is ban-worthy. Are people being banned for purposefully switching layers to game spawns?
---
this is criminally underrated top tier shitposting
---
no claw?
---
yeah praise dark lady.
---
Thanks for the info! I noticed there are a bunch of dungeon quests so maybe I should focus more on those. Two birds with one stone. 
---
I’ve had a real hard time getting a group together for them though. I often seems like I waste more time trying to put together a group than actually clearing the dungeon so I just went back to questing.
---
Call me crazy but I remember in early wow the ungoro raptor was the horde equivalent of the winterspring one. The npc was there but didn't do anything and was later removed.
---
Was just going to say that. Fast leveling and I very rarely die.
---
Hypnotic Blade + Orb of Forgotten Seer vs Illusionary Rod on Mage.  Thouhts?
---
Thanks! Even if its not accurate it's nice to have an estimate atleast!
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
This ahaha noticed that before the 69
---
Nice nice baby.
---
World first?
---
Uh... Then and \*then\*?
---
Pretty sweet.
---
&gt;decades of experience
---
&gt;WoW is 15 years old
---
wut
---
I totally agree with your statement on experience, however.
---
Do some mobs not drop anything at all? Sometimes the mob sparkles then I try and loot and nothing?
---
Calling people a troll is a classic trolling strategy.
---
\&gt;they stayed dead for a half hour.
---
Well, if that's how it was in 1.12, #nochanges, right?
---
Well, he asked for it...
---
Yeah had some dumbass try that to me and he ended up trapped, concussion shot kited with a pet on his ass as I cheetah flew him until he ran away. Dude was 5 levels up on me too or he’d be corpse running. Get too close you get marked. Do your thing and give me space, all good
---
I got in a guild, but unfortunately it still seems like I’m playing solo! Maybe I need to look for a new one. 
---
I’ll try the LFG chat channel. I didn’t even know that existed! Thanks again!
---
The wow original logo from 15 years ago have pandaria on it,check it out
---
No shit it's exploitable, the constant spam of "please invite for layer swap" makes it clear that it's exploitable.
---
The endless supply of world pvp, ganking is annoying as fuxx, I'm no coward I used to play a rogue on a Gorgonnash pvp server but it even got too much for me.. I play on a normal realm now so when I want to farm, quest, whatever I can do it in peace, and when I want to pvp I can.. I salute you guys who can go pvp full time but its a nightmare levelling up.. Besides that's what BGs are for :)
---
to add to this and i really dont mean to brag and you dont gotta believe me idc. but as a mage from vanilla to TBC i was so good i challenged anyone, including rogues, to duel while i was naked and id still win a good amount of the time.
---
I'm a hunter. Hunters mark is instant cast.
---
Maydie? Is that you?
---
Difficult to kill.. but not impossible! For the Horde!!!
---
&gt; Calling people a troll is a classic trolling strategy.
---
Accusing people of thinking like devs that killed world PvP is trolling. This is 1.13, not 1.12. Remove head from ass.
---
Link one
---
Hillary Clinton was really behind the layers all along.
---
Have you tried desolace on your server? I was having the same problems on my server but ive had no dramas at all there
---
CHEESE for everyone!
---
Looks really good!
---
We're in 2019 now mate.
---
There were files and such that say she was supposed to but that got scrapped for one reason or another I guess.
---
If it’s encrypted they can’t know for sure, but they may be able to infer based on ports or traffic shape.
---
If it’s not encrypted then yes, they can easily tell everything. 
---
Honestly playing games in this manner using company equipment and internet is playing with really dangerous fire if you have an IT staff that is even mildly capable.
---
Yeah just saw that myself. Could have sworn they had different amounts but I guess I was wrong :/
---
Not bad
---
You have an “alt” that is level 45 already??
---
btw check out my blog
---
I'm at 14.
---
Two Humans: Oh yeah! We back baby!!!  
---
Dwarf: Fuck, have to log soon to feed the baby.  
---
Gnome: Fucking divorce...
---
&gt;something that’s really good in the game.
---
Guards being impossible for a full raid of lvl 20s to kill, but trivial for a lvl 60?
---
Define "long".
---
You might've been fooled by the training point cost, that does go up each rank.
---
Any mages know if the illusionary rod (+15 int +10 spirit +7 Stam) from Scarlet library is an upgrade from the icicle rod (+4 int and +10 frost spell damage) from Wetlands?
---
I'm a frost spec primarily dungeon running for AoE dmg.
---
I am so rock hard right now
---
That's Lord Kazzak MF'er, doom lord is BC ;)
---
This is why I only do dungeon runs with clothies and the occasional rogue. If I'm going to be doing SM armory over and over I want that Herod set!
---
I joined a friend's group to RFD yesterday and out of everything that dropped I only needed one thing, the paladin got it...
---
I would just LFG as DPS at that point.. like i said, if you ask a lot of people will be cool with it, but when a hybrid class is just needing every single item because they can use the items, it’s just a pain. for example you’re a healer main and an exceptional Healing Staff dropped. there’s also a  DPS shaman and druid. Although the healer is the resto spec and should have priority bc of role, you’re telling me you wouldn’t be upset if you didn’t get that staff as the healer? It’s just common courtesy and common dungeon etiquette in vanilla. i have no clue why people are flabbergasted by the idea. this was common back in the day. Also about 99% of the time, asking before needing, if the item was off role was always responded with a yes. It’s just about being courteous.
---
How do I go about finding it?
---
Grats! Loved this guy back when I had my hunter. Wasn't best but I still kept him around till 60.
---
Gratz bb
---
The plug is shameless
---
Pservers did not have the correct values for weapon skill. You can find the most up to date info here: 
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table
---
A better question is why are lower ranks of faerie fire feral available?
---
Yah, all of the others will generally kill you in one way or another long before you get them anywhere.
---
What makes it even better is that this meme was probably around in the days of vanilla - I am pretty sure I remember laughing at it at least in TBC days
---
The struggle is real!
---
ElvUI - restyles your UI beautifully with just a few clicks. Also fully customizable to suit your needs. 
---
Gatherer or Cartographer - remembers/shows (on your map/mini-map) where you found herbs and chests. 
---
AtlasLoot - with this you can look up all the loot that bosses drop. I think you can even make a ‘wish list’ so that you can plan ahead what loot you want to obtain. 
---
There are lots of good AddOns out there. I probably have like 20 installed but can’t remember the names of all of them right now. I can write back to you the ones I have once I have access to my computer, if you’d like.
---
(replace every instance of "level" in this thread with "life")
---
It wasn't world pvp exactly, they were pretty much trying to hide the mob and grief, not pvp.
---
This is now officially my favorite meme.
---
This sounds like a personal problem, honestly.
---
Like not afk time?
---
Mobs always sparkle if they have are programmed to have a loot table, even if a particular spawn doesn't drop loot from its allocated table.
---
/played
---
do you mean time played without idling? the answer's no  
---
/played is the only metric
---
I had no idea this was a thing. Thanks for sharing!
---
How about some Mr. Nice Orc?
---
yes
---
Also playing on a potato, but the game seems to run fine. Playing on Yojamba, where there's almost never a queue, but the server it always at high pop during oceanic times. I ran a census on Alliance last night and came up with about 6k concurrent players, I've heard rumors that there's slightly more horde but haven't seen any numbers yet.
---
30 seconds to 60. 30 for dungeons, 60 for open world.
---
Yeah the time spent bitching on Reddit could be used to level. So yeah, pretty petty.
---
I am too but I know as I hit 60 it will die down
---
Well, Kanye's Stronger heavily samples Daft Punk, But I wouldn't call it a remix.  Kanye loves his samples (see Power [King Crimson]).
---
It's insane how big this post has gotten... Who cares, they still helped us get Classic, they hyped it for others. I think asmongold is right when he says he can't play it like it used to be because he's a streamer getting sniped 24/7
---
17k upvotes.. Can't believe it. You guys need to go level more and care less about how asmongold plays the game.
---
PSA, classes that are tanking really sure as hell aren't lvelling as a tank either. It just doesn't matter though.
---
I ment region
---
Guy doesnt even play but writes 3 paragraphs bitching about something the majority of players dont have a problem with. Fucking lol.
---
TFW you have people who still play retail bugging you to do +15s still
---
Maybe processor?
---
My husband and I play together too!! Such a great way to bond and spend time together. Game has brought us closer, we spend time researching and watching videos when we aren’t playing aswell. It’s a very involved game so it’s nice to have your spouse/ bestfriend right there next to you enjoying it as much as you do. We are very fortunate to have a spouse that will play with us rather then ask us not to
---
I too would have ruined that for you if at all possible.
---
But, but how are you going to play Diablo Immortal none stop and not miss on payed exp boosts, clear x dungeons with y chance (that you can improve with essence of unbelievable luck, just 5,99 per 7 potions) of getting z items for daylie quest and most importantly limited amount of attempt keys, that you can buy for 0,99 each or 5.99 for 10 or even 59,99 for unlimited keys per month.
---
Check out icyveins or kargoz rogue guide for some good idea for macros. I think setting up macros is best explained with a visual representation so check YouTube as well. Lots of handy ones out there
---
I am 16/60 and I love it. No rush to 60
---
I remember doing it on an undead but it may have been during TBC.
---
In some dungeons like BFD, near every other mob is a spellcaster. I'm not spamming ES to take your aggro, I'm trying to help you out! I do always switch off Rockbiter, though.
---
Just like the movie tbh
---
Paladins have no taunt what so ever so I don't know what this aoe taunt you are talking about is. Righteous defense was added in tbc.
---
Barren is the second worst leveling experience in the game, first being whenever you get hardcore camped in a PVP zone. The actual zone design is fucking garbage where you spend 80% of the time running far distances per quest and grinding mobs for quest items with 5% drop rate.
---
My mana, bandages, priest/druid/shaman mana, healthstone, health pot, pet mana.... All starts looking the same to me.
---
Good to know, ty. I thought this was a glitch I was personally having lol.
---
Keep skinning, it will make you more money (since you are a mage) than most professions. Especially when DM come out and you can farm dogs
---
Thank you for being the voice of reason in a thread full of idiots and armchair economists.
---
Yea game isn’t designed to be played while AFK so there’s no timer that tells the difference..
---
you don't need a group to kill an elite beast, you need a group to clear elite PACKS of mobs to get to one chest. it doesn't matter if it's an elite beast in a dungeon because unless it drops a SPECIFIC skin you can only get from that beast in that dungeon you would roll on it(think the beast in ubrs or mc core hounds).
---
Darkshore is an alliance zone. So no, it is not an open PvP area.
---
BoE rolls to sell = exactly what greed roll is for.
---
BoE rolls that you will equip immediately = need.
---
1. Re-released the greatest and most successful mmorpg to date* Also that was the stance of the team who originally made wow too. Whoopsie.
---
2. no you said playing an mmorpg without wanting to interact with other players is soulless.
---
3. who said forced? we're talking about intentions. The game was designed for multi-boxxing, because the game was designed to be played however the players want. 
---
You keep swapping arguments and moving goalposts because you never had a leg to stand on and are too immature to just admit you were wrong. Not even that, you can't even admit your opponent had a point. Go get some sleep, school's started again and you will need it. If you're out of school and still this way, I'm sorry.
---
DS ruin warlock, kinda.
---
May not be layering. Capital cities should de less populated as people quest/dungeon in further places. Gadgetzan/Booty bay have been packed while cities mostly lowbies on my server.
---
Moments like that are why I play this game.  Looks like a fun group!
---
Hah I’m a lvl 38 alliance on Bigglesworth. Take that horde!
---
Twink item, maybe be able to resell for what you payed for it once BGs are out... Maybe
---
Successful tanks I’ve had are typically the highest or a higher level than most of the group. They also are good at managing rage (warrior tip in general) and build individual threat first then keep it up with AoE threat. Also they don’t wait til the mob dies to swap
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Imagine doing this in real life
---
Sorry I didnt mentioned it, I'm Alliance. Thanks for the reply!
---
Log out, log in? Does that teleport you to entrance? Do you stay in the group?
---
I don't play wow but live following the community news and just the game in general so noob question here but what is the TLDR of the layer stuff going on and what is a layer?
---
Yeah but you forgot to tell them you have to be in Silithus and do it at 21:00 sharp!
---
Congratulations!
---
During the first week ques i know alot of people who switches to rp realms to beat the pack, but dont actually give a fuck about role playing. I assume thats like 70 percent of the people on those realms now. Bit of a shame
---
TRAITORS
---
Yeah you're definitely doing it right. Honestly layering isn't even an issue unless you explicitly go out of your way to try to break the system.
---
Thank you. Should I join those chats near the dungeon and ask for LFG?
---
Alexsensual is probably the dumbest sack of shit I have ever had the displeasure of clicking on a piece of content from.
---
No problem. I think you can also fly Astranaar to Ratchet but I'd have to double check.
---
Would love to see the route you took. Was it the same?
---
There's a lfg group?
---
You already know the /1 general chat channel. Alongside this there also is /2 Trade (only accessible in major cities (Darnassus, Ironforge, Stormwind for the alliance and Orgrimmar, Undercity and Thunderbluff for the Horde). /3 LocalDefense (this channel mainly informs you about ongoing hostile interactions with NPCs of your faction. It's a good indicator to see if your faction is being raided by players of the enemy faction. Last but not least there is /4 LookingForGroup which is the same for everybody regardless if you are in Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdoms.
---
/1 and /2 are connected in major cities so it doesn't matter which city you are in to use these channels.
---
You can join channels by either typing "/join channelname" in chat or using the chat bubble top left of your chat window. Leave channels by typing "/leave channelname or number".
---
In addition you can create your very own chat channels aswell for example /join superfunchannel will create such chat channel.
---
Hope that helps a bit. Good luck finding groups now :)
---
Me not that kind of orc!
---
someone went there the first hour the servers were up im pretty sure lol.
---
Fubar? Wtf
---
I'm pretty sure Classic is not all about add-oning your way into retail, but to each his own.
---
Then you really wouldn't be able to get rid of it without even worse queues than we have now.
---
Alliance FPs in Kalimdor are beyond fucked. Auberdine holds some sort of monopoly forcing all the other flight masters to always send people through there. In fact, I'm starting to believe that Cataclysm happened solely to destroy that town.
---
Teach it screech
---
There is a minimum damage requirement in place to make you eligible for loot and quest credit, even if you tag the mob.
---
Like which country on the bottom part of choosing realms? If so, US.
---
Hunters are ridiculously overpowered at low levels as it is, putting stats on their weapons would just be overkill.
---
Not yet. Settings will come in a future version :).
---
Gobs git shit done but gnomes have more fun. It's about priorities with your downtime lol
---
Fuck you for wall running. Let other people join in aswell - this is one of the reasons why we get shit like layering
---
It's about whatever you want it to be about. This is why I don't post on reddit. Toxic Classic Elitists like you.
---
Thank you for all the info! Really helpful!
---
Well idk about you but I got BT and tidal in about 30min each by hopping
---
yeah, or reboot.
---
Not sure. I'm pretty slow when it comes to computer stuff. Would this help?

Not yet, but settings will come in a future version :).
---
Yup, I think so too, considering how packed Arathi was each time. on two layers I couldn't even find a single ore for around 10 minutes except for the occasional truesilver ones. And chat was really booming.
---
You know a game is good when it's potentially ruining your life lol
---
I'm so close to making this work, currently stuck on getting wowmapper to acknowledge that wow is on. I'm assuming that's why consoleport is not letting me calibrate the left stick.
---
That is a SWEET pet! Great idea. It looks absolutely stunning next door to Rockstrongo.
---
I had to post this comment since this thread had 666 comments.
---
I prefer travelling to the zone in which the dungeon is located. Then ask for a group in the general chat.
---
Also, travelling to the dungeon's meeting stone can be another way to find a group.
---
Yes, with AQ quest lines.

Layer abuse got debunked, they had to move onto something new.

My main issue is that my GF is completely from the Sims and Stardew Valley. Gaming is new to her so she spent 30 minutes earlier refinding WSAD movement being immersed in the environment completely. I did explain what PVP is and she decided on PVE. I'll probably just main PVE with her then when shes not online run a PVP character on the side.
---
It's genius.
---
do you get confused a lot?
---
Weird flex
---
It’s called the entire Azeroth, just quest in places your level and you will find players of the opposite faction around your level there too, cause they will also be questing. As far as avoiding players higher level, there is no way, they purposely come to lower level zones to ruin people’s day, just the way it is.

Prob to late, but got priest to 19, hated running solo, switched up to druid to get back to tanking, is tanking as druid viable endgame? or will it be back to healing?
---
You earn yourself a big downvote hoard scum
---
I started when BC launched and rolled a hunter. Never touched it since Cataclysm.
---
Returned to Classic and decided for some nostalgia. While it’s annoying to manage it all, I’m enjoying managing ammo, pet happiness and loyalty again. Yes I forgot to bring more ammo than my pouch could hold, and yes my pet occasionally brought additional mobs in... all part of the classic experience!
---
You are right, an alliance has to spawn the egg. If you pick up the egg you get the chicken
---
No, I have a bank alt, well 3 actually that I divide all my loot and mail to
---
Tapper McNobb
---
I,didnt say that either.
---
In this scenario that's what would make them boring, yes.
---
&gt;finally
---
&gt;day 11 of classic wow
---
Unsurprising how annoying you are when your username gives it away
---
Hunter trinket does not break fear. Only stun, root, slow
---
IME it gets significantly better at 30 when you can train Slam. Being able to use an ability outside your 3.5 second auto attacks is enormous. I can take on two whole mobs before eating now! (one at a time of course, lets not get crazy)
---
imagine the game world is a plate. When the plate is full of players, another plate gets stacked on top of it, and when that one is full, another gets stacked on top of it. Each plate has its own mobs and resources on it. A player can move between plates if he is invited to a group by a player on a different plate. They maintain their own position in the world, but they're on a higher/lower plate.
---
The drama is that a person can go from one plate to another, in practice this would be like respawning resource nodes and monsters around the player.
---
Kromcrush is an awesome server. I don’t get as many spams about layerhopping as others have complained.. the ques are manageable (non existent until peak). There didn’t need to be server transfers. I’m hoping more alliance roll here as well to get things balanced some more. Because everything else I’ve found have been awesome
---
This is true.  Kanyes Stronger gets some cool points for being an entirely new model of the original simply because of the fact that Daft Punk collaborated. 
---
Hell, remixing is an important part of DJing in general and as one of the 5 pillars (or elements) of hip hop is common. So its usually fun for an audiophile to figure where those samples came from,l. Kanyes rather prolific.l but I doubt there's a rapper alive who doesn't .
---
Theres a YouTube channel show where they have famous Rappers choose vinyls at random and mix them into something.  El From Run the Jewels was on it.
---
His name is catcawp and you can tell in the future by looking at the very top left. Hope that helps
---
You said you have an alt dedicated to mining and that it’s level 45 gathering high level ores?
---
Can they see the traffic from my iphone (twitch.etc) or is it encrypted?
---
Na we don't want you plugging your channel here
---
Til 180 degrees &lt; 30 degrees
---
Unfortunately it's justified then. Had he been the only one to roll need besides you, it'd be crappy. Fortunately there will be bop stuff better than it for you, and there would be no way for him to know you wouldn't just sell it either.
---
The mailbox bank is the best bank
---
She's trying, bless her heart.
---
Whispers: &gt;!no!&lt;
---
Unsurprisingly, 9x amount of people kinda NEED, and will thusly consume 9x the amount of resources in the world, so it basically evens out and theres no real difference. 
---
Shocking i know.
---
The short answer is +healing is near useless at lower levels. 
---
The slots you can get it in would be better served stacking heavy spirit and medium int followed by observing the 5 second rule and using fitted heals with ZERO overhealing. 
---
As long as you are not overhealing your largest heal is your most mana efficient by far. 
---
When you notice mana is full throw out heals and buffs ignoring 5 second rule, then return to mana efficient mode. 
---
The game changes totally when you start nearing 200+ healing and have many ranks of spells to choose from. 
---
If your tank is good, priest should have decent dps recorded throughout the whole instance from wanding while waiting to heal.
---
For any hunters out there wondering what pets are rare and what pets are good for what, Petopia is a great resource.  [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/)
---
That list Will be made by me from 1 gank cos allies can't kill you solo
---
Blap
---
I know this is the Axe, but.. uh.. i can't help but think it looks like a swastika :(
---
If only there were an option for people who don’t like pvp.
---
Your comment history is the real yikes
---
Bfa bad
---
Resto spec at lvl 30?  You obviously don’t get it.
---
Those boxes you just fish up in BB? also good stuff inside??
---
why do I see this everyday
---
Wait how? I mean hunters run at 30% faster with aspect of chetah no?
---
News Flash: if you're DPS and you're complaining about a "Tank" or a "Healer" taking gear- you can kick rocks. Without those two nobody does anything (even those AoE Warrior / Mage groups, y'all are dead in the water without a healer). Don't like it? Roll a class that contributes rather than just bitching. 
---
Disclaimer: I played a Warrior in Vanilla and lost a Zin'Rohk to a top guilds fuckin bank alt.. and I was tanking. Scarred me for life.
---
Made it way too easy? MC was *never* hard to begin with. They didn’t change anything, they used the accurate values that pservers (which made raids harder) never had.
---
Don‘t need it atm but that‘s a great post. Thank you :)
---
Hello!
---
Got him yesterday after about 3 hrs of camping the tree. One Orc hunter was camping as well, didn't see me waiting in Shadowmeld though. He went afk after some time, Humar spawned and bam! There is generally much Horde traffic around that spot
---
Implying it's impossible to break an addiction?
---
You can run from IF over the mountains, jump off the closest montain to Menethil, die and respawn at Menethil GY.
---
Tbh, spirit.  Spirit tap op
---
You are right, but boosting have existed in wow for many years. Where you carry less experienced friends. 
---
I think that the majority of players on classic realms are there for the community, friends, nostalgia, leveling/going through dungeons and raids in their own speed. Really there is nothing to rush, some players have a lot of time on their hands, and some hsve work, family, relations to maintain. Keeping classic timeline as its planned will get all the players to experience the content before its out-dated. This will only be a issue for the very hardcore players. And they will most likely grind honor points for rank 14 anyway.
---
What a nice upsidedown upvote above my head!
---
DK being level 58 or even 68 would have been okay if you were forced to do an attunement and/or a character sacrifice for the character. I get that a hero class should get a benefit or two, but it should have been gated a bit more than it was.
---
The map seems to be from TBC. Lots of inaccurate levels and the starting zones for blood elfs and draenei seem to be on the map.
---
Just wait until you get to Stranglethorn Vale, you won't need to think about it.
---
Sprint  gouge pet and get close enough for a blind and you're on top of them in an ideal world
---
Yup. Apes has been in private servers for years &amp; started planning world firsts strategies the second wow classic was announced.  Props to them for it. They put a lot of time into achieving that.
---
I think I might have made like 40g from selling them. They sold for 2.6g early on and now more people have caught on and it's like 1.4g Zandalar Tribe if you don't want to waste too much silver on deposits. Still about 1g profit even if you buy everything from AH.
---
I was the tauren druid that ran into y'all when y'all were mounting up in the Badlands. #GangGang
---
I leave most allies alone, but whenever I see a hunter I kill them.
---
They are the only ones who are capable of both: kiting me to my death and chasing me down.
---
Every other class I can flee from or kill, hunters? I murder their asses.

Read the whole blue post

Always need on BOE.
---
I could've equipped it immediately afterwards? idk man it doesnt seem right to me
---
All the rogue needs to do is use throw weapon and suddenly the hunter is dazed and in an even worse position
---
I feel rend doesnt damage enough to spend the rage on it atm

/u/title2imagebot
---
It seems you're using crude language in a way that obscures your meaning. You're saying that people who dislike layering, etc. have a problem with people who use layering mechanics to do things in Classic?
---
good doggy
---
who said level 30? you took the most useless take on this. i’m done talking to monkeys for today
---
This garbage isn't even related to wow. Go plug this crap somewhere else.
---
Not really a definitive cheat sheet then :P
---
All good though
---
My rule is: BoE blue you always roll need. Since gold will also give you an upgrade.
---
I announce it when I create a group tho that everyone should need.
---
Thats how it was on my server 15 years ago and thts how most of my buddies also understand it.
---
Maybe you should be more... dead
---
that sounds like a fun story as well, yeah surprising moments happens, and its so refreshing afterwards.

FUCKING GG

So if I understand correctly demo shout only generate 120 base threat, no matter how much target affected? So the opposite, if you are only 2, pexing in the wild, demo shout are always better is that correct?
---
sorry you are right i meant rightous fury. I wrote it better in the follow up, my first comment was quick and not in depth
---
I play on Grobbulus and can confirm these types of shenanigans are the norm here. The other day I came across a war council of Tauren in Thunderbluff.
---
You'll be too busy watching your ass from being ganked lol
---
I mean I literally watched a guy on stream abuse layering to farm ore and skins. Dude had 2500 gold when I stopped watching and said he had about 3K more in mats. I don’t really know if I believe blizzard here.
---
So imagine I am knocking on your door. You ask who I am and I respond that I am George. You're still not sure who that is, and ask me "George who?" prompting me to also give my surname. I then repond that I am George Stockton.
---
Normal interaction.
---
In the OP, the joker told it wrong. It's supposed to be "Little old lady" or "Old little lady."
---
So in the joke, I am identifying myself as "Old little lady" you ask for me to clarify by asking "Old little lady who?" and instead of clarifying, I tell the joke's punchline. "I didn't know you could yodel!" Because "Old little lady who?" when spoken out loud sounds like yodeling.
---
Generally Knock-Knock jokes are a play on words or pun-based. They work best when told in person, rather than in writing.
---
One of the most basic versions is this:
---
*Knock-Knock*
---
*Who's there?*
---
*Boo.*
---
*Boo who?*
---
*Why are you crying?*
---
They're simple jokes, and often they're simply not funny, so don't feel bad about not laughing. They're usually bad.
---
To me it really depends if the boe is valuable or if he will just vendor it later. If edgemasters drop there is no way anyone is getting that for free
---
I killed Fozruk 100% on my own and he didn't drop his quest item.
---
You're an idiot
---
Need on BoEs. Sorry guy that really wanted that 500g shoulder piece but everyone else in the group wants the 500g as well.
---
It’s a great path I’ll  be using it agin often to get into ironforge, it’s a neat way to bypass the duellers and get into the trench.
---
I just pay back the lobbies of their faction sevenfold. I got corpse camped for a half hour the other day by 4 rogues. I’m still getting vengeance for that one.
---
Only thing he is good for is sac
---
90% playing a shit ton of computer games for 5 days straight. 10% experience and knowledge of game mechanics. and 100 reasons to remember the name
---
MC is a total joke with 1.12 talents and gear.   A 1.12 char is worth like 2 1.1 characters.
---
They also use the fire resist buff from ubrs.  +81 fire resist for free.
---
I got this a lot in vanilla, never played it!
---
Hooooly shit, that’s gold. Thank you kind druid.
---
adding /stopcasting before a spell will ensure that any currently casting spell will cancel. Useful for instant cast finishers like Soulburn and such
---
I'm saying people making threads about games they don't even play had their layering theories debunked, so now they have to move onto other shit they don't actually care about, like guard difficulty. That would be you.
---
I dispise that dungeon with a passion. Everytine i run it is a 2 hour run but man its kind of nice lol awesome clutch!
---
?
---
I had Aaron Jones and Davante... great start to the season lol
---
this is the proper way.
---
Do you run google chrome or any other programs in the background that can suck up system memory?
---
I still remember when my buddy brought me there ages ago, 'Dude you gotta see this! Follow me!' 
---
Thought it was super cool and got me always trying to wall-walk around to find another nifty things.
---
They can wear mail at 40 so rolling on them aint a terrible thing
---
"WTB page 10, have 17 copies of page 26"
---
BGs aren’t in the game yet and won’t be for quite some time.
---
If it helps with your calculation, you get one bubble of rested xp per 8 hours while in a resting zone, capped at 30 bubbles (10 days unplayed). Someone here stated that the speed is 1/8 while not resting, so it would take 64 hours per bubble of rested xp
---
Well for one have all items from multiple layers listed on the same AH means prices will be driven down. While more people might buy more, items are not bought immediately 99% of the time. Raid day they might be bought out instantly but the other days they will sit and pile up. So by having something on the AH at 10s the next person does 9s, and the next 8s etc. Eventually this lowers a price as people won't buy unless it's cheap since they know it will get there. On Original this wasn't as bad because you might have 5 people farming any one thing to put on the AH, but with layers now you have 20 all competing for the quick sale. This means that it's essentially bad to farm anything hardcore because the price will end up cheap unless you micromanage. Now how is that worse? On original you could essentially have a "business" in one area of the game, make gold, and have a reputation. So while it's different it's objectively worse for those looking for the Original experience and ruins it for them.
---
Find a duo partner to level with or just do dungeons
---
Yeah lol buddy.. go back to watching asmongold or some bullshit stream.
---
If you're Alliance, you can get Rock Pulverizer and then later Bonebiter as some guaranteed 2h weapons. You need someone to carry you for 10-15 minutes for Rock Pulverizer but it's comparable to WW Axe and a lot less effort on you and the person trying to carry you.
---
Blade + Orb
---
I play on bloodsail cant believe i missed this
---
They are locked for people that isn’t transfering till tomorrow.
---
Amen!
---
There's almost no skill involved outside leveling quickly and constantly.
---
The only acceptable reason to log in to retail
---
Okay, I did not know this. I personally dislike this, they're going on about instanced gameplay and that's fine but the consequences of this in classic where social activity is the name of the game and there are other implications like economics and world pvp.... But as you say it's not against ToS apparently. More money for acti-blizx I guess :)
---
Cowabunga it is!
---
I believe they said the new servers would be locked for the first day in order for people to transfer and get their names, then it would be open to others. Is this not in line with that statement?
---
Good trolling my dude.
---
Well, I agree people shouldn't make topics about things they don't care about. Looking at popular topics in r/wow and r/classicwow, maybe people really do care about that time when they had 4 silver pieces and 20 copper pieces.
---
I do care about this, otherwise I wouldn't have made the topic. It's sort of like seeing someone you were once in a relationship with in a bad state and wanting to help them, even if you have no desire to get back together with them.
---
1.12 is a massive nerf to mc..
---
Yeaaaa
---
All that +heal means nothing if you can't regenerate mana fast enough.
---
I dont
---
Frostbite is really good so it sucks not getting that, but really frost is still easily one of the best spec in the game for pvp so you should still be advantaged vs nearly every other class.
---
I need help with the same thing, any suggestion on ability placement on your bars?
---
yea the guy is clueless, BC was when wow hit the fan, WotLK brought nothing new to the table but jet another zone, yet more levels and it did not help sub numbers, in fact this is when it started to go down.
---
Welcome to the pvp realms.
---
Better argument is that daggers are all around trash for rogue leveling but anyway.
---
This is plain wrong. If you don't have the skill to dodge the right attacks or to send out heals and spells in the exact moment, like Apes did with their 5 years private server experience, you still need FR or other lvl 60 blue gear to compensate.
---
If it was communicated, sure. Not just spur of the moment "Oh hey I'm going to need this because I need gold"
---
I've also noticed that RTVs are regularly only giving 2 ore per node. This seems completely wrong. Small thorium veins are giving 1 ore per node regularly as well. The spawn locations for RTV have also been changed
---
If you honestly think I'm trolling you need to spend less time on reddit. I am deadly serious. Yes maybe winding you up a bit at the end there.. but seriously. My brother and I have made a shit load of gold. Why in the fuck would we quit a game we love and are now ahead of everyone else in?
---
wait until information security hears about this unauthorized change :P
---
I'm pushing my masters, few missing courses, work 30 hours a week in a company I really really really want to make an impression in for further career, all this while trying to level in Classic.
---
I'm getting about 4 hours of sleep each night and yeaaaah, this is gonna blow up nicely at some point.
---
And I love every moment I get to be online.
---
No one in the capital is gonna side with the guy who assumes he should just have any BoE because he wants to wear it.
---
Yea, got dcd at lvl 6 and hit a 16k queue. Had to swap realm :(
---
We've already established that you don't understand why guards and flight masters were buffed in the first place, and if you would acknowledge it you still wouldn't care. It's more like wanting to control the person who you split up with after the relationship is ended, as well as the person they're with. Nobody fucking asked.
---
And I’m over here struggling to get to lvl30
---
I recently got the 14 slot from Uldaman I finally get to drop my 8 slot :)
---
Well he is a hunter after all.
---
Shut up gnome! (;
---
AOE is completely useless for pvp, but what’s improved blizzard like 2 points? I’m sure you could spare that and still make a competent pvp build
---
Spy addon tracks every pvp you did for you ;)
---
It's gotten to the point where I just  let the healer drink up so I can aggressively life tap after each pull.
---
Is this secretly the best trolling of 2k19?
---
Or is this a thirteen year old calling people kids....
---
Can't......tell........./FuturamaFryMeme
---
You're entirely missing the point of the post.
---
&gt;eventually it will be done.
---
Oh the lies we students tell ourselves.
---
But, I want stats... haha
---
Yeah I want IF because I skipped almost all SW rep quests. And so I'm worried that if I don't stick to IF rep quests wherever possible, I wont be able to get a mount at 40.
---
Im about 95% full bar friendly now at lvl20.
---
Any tips? Maybe you have some other areas in mind that would be suitable or maybe I should really get to Darkshore to reach my goal?
---
Banned lol
---
Damn mages. While you're over there pulling an entire village of mobs with ease and I'm wanding 1 mob at a time to death, PW: Fort is 750 mana at the moment and water is expensive, not that you would know. Gimmie smart.
---
I normally close it unless I need something to watch/listen to while grinding. I did the same thing in the live version and had no problems.
---
If you're lvl 21 you should be looking at doing Deadmines in Westfall. Go there and look at chat. You'll see LFM or LFG: looking for more or looking for group. Some might say "LF tank DM gtg" wich means looking for a tank for deadmines then good to go. Depending on what role you're looking to fill in a group,  you can type in chat you're looking to fulfill that role and you'll probably get an invite. Deadmines is a bit wierd though,  some people say VC standing for Van Cleef, the final deadmines boss. But we dont listen to those people,  they're different.
---
Just found out there is something like that but only local as it should be because of what others described.  
---
 **VanasKOS** 
---
Couldn't try it because im at work but as a tank I gonna give it a shoot.
---
Blizzard was banning people left right and centre during the Broken Shore patch for exploits smaller than this. But Blizzard doesnt have to balls to go against top guilds and streamers.
---
I think lorewise demon hunters have a demon inside them who they are constantly fighting, trying to stay in control.
---
I was leveling my fishing in the Elwynn Forest leveling my fishing when a conversation started if a person could knock out a kagaroo. I of course jumped right into this conversation.
---
You give yourself too much credit if you think that was a comeback. It was merely an observation.
---
Undead rouge
---
no, just timed it well with printscreen because sitting at 99-100% xp I knew it was going to level me up
---
Wrong. If it's grayed out (tagged to other ppl), nothing you do reduces their xp.
---

---
I got kicked because I took a tin node from bfd lol. Didn't see that the leader asked to roll or share. But even so aren't nodes herbs etc free for all? I just ignored the prick.
---
The game would be unplayable without layering atm. I still fight for mob tags even with multiple layers
---
Lol not my realm
---
I try finding weapons a few levels close to mine and all there is a blue 22 for 50g
---
I tried buying a health pot and there are only a few minor and lesser
---
And there are almost no herbs
---
This is on a low pop realm  so u speak bullshit
---
And u cant imagine how long I have to spam every possible channel to find a seller for that
---
no actually needing gold is not a spur of the moment thing. honestly people just expect this to be common knowledge and arent going to remember to remind everyone of the basic rules of etiquette.
---
Thanks man, would you perhaps recommend some other Location instead for my situation? Lvl 20 want to maximize IF rep, did Dun Morogh +Loch Modan already
---
I know man, I know. :(
---
It's not except for your opener but takes up a spot. Claw is better use of focus at all times
---
You don't seem to understand how the economy works on this specific item, which is ok, I'll reiterate. 
---
What I said is OP was not wildly undercutting market price on this item. The unusually high price is not the normal market value of this item, it is the severely inflated price if no one happens to be selling any others at that time and a warrior is desperate enough to buy a single at an extremely exaggerated price. 
---
So OP can either undercut by 1-5s, as per your suggestion, and sit there on the AH likely not selling the item until the actual market price comes in from other people, causing him to lose the fee to list the item.
---
OR, as he stated in the comments, he knows the actual market price this item sells at and knows for a fact the items listed were an attempt to get a lucky unusually high sale, while not necessarily being a price that they will actually sell at.
---
Except that they will aggro mobs, especially in tightly packed dungeons.
---

It’s a lot of fun and so addicting I love going to new zones seeing what new mobs I’m gonna fight and so on.

Will def have to look into this! I just turn the splash sound way up while studying my notes 😂

That is dedication i like it

I'm not denying MC is relatively easy. I will say though that what &lt;APES&gt; did is not something 40 average players can cobble together and do. These guys played private servers for years and took months of preparation to do what they did. 
---
Do you need 2,000 gold gloves? Of course not. But don't expect to roll into MC at level 58 in 45 greens and do what &lt;APES&gt; did.
---
I'll have you know that I'm a level 24 paladin.
---
Everyone betrayed me! I’m fed up with this raid.
---
Nope that's the price you pay.
---
roll need on BOE always! everyone everywhere do this!
---
When stepping into Classic people really need to ditch the retail mindset.  Classic is a entire different game.

I had containers selected with no other filtering
---
Bad at wow and can’t read, that’s gotta be rough.
---
Also in PVE. It's another garrote during combat which is quite a lot of extra DPS.

---
I prefer him telling me I can't come than to end up at a wrong party.
---
I walked from valley of trials to thunderbluff to meet a buddy over there and I was navigating on sheer luck and prayer.
---
Except it doesn't let you view your bank everywhere. :(
---
So this is okay? Like, I should roll need on BoEs in the future?
---
Thank you for this explanation!
---
You misunderstand me.
---
Solo they're an absolute joke, same as warrs most of the time.
---
It's just when they group up they have batshit powerful utility that makes them capable of swinging big battles
---
Yet not true to what classic was as scarce materials places importance on certain professions. Farming mats took effort and with layering you cut that effort by 2x-5x. Even if there is more people to consume them you still have people abusing the layering to get more than those same amount of people would on an original server. Isn't the whole purpose of this to get the original experience? Otherwise if we want unimportant professions and stupidly cheap mats we would play BFA.
---
Ahh right forgot about that. Can you throw while moving or do you have to stand still for it?
---
I think the droprates for shadow silk in wowhead aren't accurate so just wondering if anyone knows a good spot for 
---
Shadow silk
---
If you look at hps chats. Paladins are ANYthing but meh healers.
---
In pvp, people aren't going to ignore you because you turn any warrior around you into a monster.
---
sorry for wanting to go afk for a bit, and not wanting to sit in 1 for hours
---
Heals on point ❤️ any healer is Better then no healer.
---
As a hunter, guilty as charged. Literally every time. It has caused me some problems though because it's such an indication of aggression for some people that they just go insta ham. It's my way of saying hello!! Another thing I love to do is lay a freezing trap under an unsuspecting player and taunt them.. but even then his homeboy might come running around the corner thinking his friend is in trouble!
---
The only Problem being that you only generate 80% threat in battle/berserkstance and 130% in def stance. Meaning that if there isnt a significant difference in your 2h weapon and 1h weapon you wont generate more threat when going for dps.
---
Humar the Pridelord? Yeah, I really want him too. Last time I attempted it there were a bunch of horde hunters sitting around waiting for him, so I decided to bail. Maybe someday :')
---
Occaiosnal skirmishes are cool. Just tonight I chased down and killed several horde around (and a bit above) my own level and got chased around myself.
---
On the other hand, there’s no point indulging campers high level enough that I have no chance fighting back, especially if it’s a case that can’t be helped by numbers (calling in nearby questers, etc). I’d rather sit it out and do what I can to starve the camper of their gratification.
---
Perfect
---
paladins beat priests up until priests get naxx gear, so you are technically right, but still ignoring a large chunk of end game.
---
Lol what are you even going to do 5 years into an untouched Classic? Everything runs its course...
---
Yep. This is how I did it.
---
What is endgame for you?
---
Druids are insane dungeon tanks, but are off tanks only usually in raids. (If anything)
---
They can tank every raid, and there are some top players who main tank as a did, but they are on the whole definitely worse than warriors, mostly due to crushing blows.
---
Just go back to petting that picture on your skin.
---
Better would be a screenshot of earthfury being low pop
---
If you rolled on Faerlina you knew what you were signing up for.
---
Lol classic makes everything in classic easy. Get over it and enjoy the journey.
---
If you are going to use scroll for keybinds use it for your most often used spells. Like mind blast scroll up and shadow word pain scroll down. And if you put those keybinds in an action at that you gonna switch to for healing with the macro you want. Then use shield and renew on scroll. Might as well make it a mouse over macro too. 
---
You will laugh at how easy the game becomes.
---
Might be a shit image to use. Not at my computer right now. When you look on the world map there are 3 tiny islands scattered about that of course you be er go to. Are any of these the islands we have today or just random islands on the map? Thanks
---
Probably a Millenial, or Gen-X.
---
with free fr buff
---
There's no need to skip a rank. Other beasts have those ranks too, just a few levels higher.
---
I forget how +spell damage is applied to AoE, I know it isn't just added on top to all your targets and ticks. Given that, you shouldn't have to do too much fiddly math to decide which upgrades are worth it, look at the vendor price and if everything on there is relevant to your character (so no agility or w/e) then you should be safe considering that an upgrade. If it DID have a weird stat on it, you could check the auction house for something comparable to help you decide, or go with your gut.

I think it's just an addon showing them, they were a thing during vanilla beta and/or alpha but "removed" via just setting them to max at all times.
---
GTFO out of here with all that making sense nonsense
---
Yep. In Vanilla I ran my Orc hunter all the way to the Dwarf starting area to get the lvl 12 White Bear. Only white bear before Winterspring lvl 55+, and everyone I met on Horde wanted one as I levelled. It was great.
---
Uuuuuh.... There are people farming and hoarding already. I’m not even lvl 30, and these people at 60 are not only at a huge advantage for being first, they’re also abusing layering to further increase the lead. Layers shouldn’t be in upper half of the game tbh.
---
Also elvui works in classic..... It's decent too.
---
You're delusional
---
because holy fire is a piece of shit? its sometimes onjly slightly better than smite, but still adds an extra second
---
Might be an engine limitation, might be so nobody can steal your corpses if you're a skinner, who knows? There's never been any official word as far as I know.
---
When you do that, you actually nerf the XP that the player would have gotten.
---
Goodbye my weekend. I won’t be gaining any leveling messing with mods now.
---
You're so delusional it's unreal
---
It's like anti-buffs for your enemies. We can't give you proper drive-by buffing, but this is the next best thing.
---
You've played Retail, right?
---
Lol, to me it doesn’t matter how long it takes, as long as your having fun. I have a guild that sometimes I push to level with other my level and then sometimes I drop down and help low level guildies. So much fun. ❤️
---
Omg ty!
---
Yeah I wasn’t really considering it that much lol. I have to sit around for 3 days in 2 weeks time with no one else in the quiet office so I think I’m gonna just get a 4gb wireless modem, bring my laptop in and play that way
---
Does your mouse like that marble?

i had people do this when i sold charms also.
---
Am I old does nobody remember .hack?
---

---
The best thing you can do is the following: 
---
Level up with an AoE spec.
---
AoE should provide you with enough money as for you to don't give a single fuck spending 1g at lvl 60 to respect into a PvP build. 
---
Heck that's what I'm doing: and I'm just respeccing to modify 2 single talent points.
---
Phase 2 and 3 aren't on yet, so better expend time leveling and making some money than wasting time killing unhonored rivals.
---
Illusionary Rod has stamina on it that you might not feel you need, but it's definitely good. If you aren't having trouble staying alive in dungeons, it's safe to sleep on stamina for a bit.
---
Which lasts for 30min IIRC.
---
Also worth noting that Druids unlock the water form (allowing 50% increased water movement speed &amp; unlimited breath) which is the best class for any underwater gathering.
---
If any sort of filtering allowed for layer enumeration, census addons would be completely busted.
---
I have over 25k characters logged in my census.
---
This post is autistic. Just play the game.
---
hes right though, if you're some lvl 40 shitter still you can't comment on shit like this.
---
This comment can summarize the entire year of 2019. Neat.
---
I'm a Hunter so I just run past with Cheetah and then drop a frost trap to freeze em.. Then blow them a kiss and keep on running

yea, why? Are they actually the broken isles kul tiras/zandalar?
---
The drums of war beat again...and the cycle of hatred continues lol
---
Why are all the areas except for starting ones like 10-60 15-60? GL leveling to 60 in Darkshore. That way the map doesn't represent actual levels you can meet in this area.

Easiest way for Ally to get to Scarlet Monastery? I have the South Shore flight path, are there any other FPs I can grab on the way to Trisfal Glades? Or do I just walk over and take the trek

I had a dude who knew I was enhancement going into a dungeon, the plan all along was I was supposed to be rolling enhancement "tank"
---
Then freaked the fuck out when I rolled need on some Agi stam shoulders all because it was 1 hr 40 minutes later and we still didnt have a 5th and they decided to throw me in the "healer" role and the other guy was a rogue. "You are healing how dare you need dps gear in a 4man" and a bunch of other shit about how all i do is need/steal gear when I had passed dozens of decent upgrades in our previous run the night before because they were more valuable to him and our druid tank at the time. 
---
He then trade spammed me mid fucking pull 6 times while the other two were dying. So I just left.

Announcing at the start doesnt always seem to matter.

I can't tell, because I'm not a racist bigot.

a ton of those warriors wont make it and of those that do, the majority will be fury plebs

... Right? The hell is everyone in this thread rejoicing over. That's admittance its being exploited..
---
Furthermore, this subreddit seems to love countdown to classic. 119 had someone by the name of Sara on explaining that resource nodes are fully exploitable with how clustering works and he refused to tell Josh how to do it because it's in live as we speak.
---
fair

Layering though? Its 'abusable' for a week or a few more until they remove it.

---
This is true, but they could rework it so its more like the mythic groups or listing a raid, running around screaming LFG/LFM in the chat is just inefficient sometimes.
---
If a server has a large population of logged on players, there's two possible solutions that can be done.
---
1. Dynamically increase the respawn rate of mobs, mining &amp; herb nodes, etc. Problem is that you'll still have a shit load of players visible to each other, and some of those players can take advantage by hogging some of the resources being spawned faster than normal. Think of someone standing on an herb node and grabbing the herb each time it spawns instead of moving on after harvesting it once.
---
2. Dynamically spawning new layers (zones and such) and transferring players to those new layers. The result is for each layer, they keep the spawn rate of mobs and nodes constant and players can only observe other players and resources in the same layer (so the herbalist mentioned in 1 above doesn't have the incentive to stand on a node he just harvested since it's not going to respawn rapidly). So the population that they see looks reasonable. Of course, steps are taken so that players who should see each other, can see each other (all party members in same layer, etc.). Players can't exploit the increased resource spawning since within any given layer, there is no increase. But if a player is capable of switching between layers at will, they can "harvest" resources in each layer that haven't already been gathered. An example of such an exploit would be the last two levels Jokerd made during his record run to 60. He would kill a pack of mobs, then get an invite to another layer where that pack was still alive, so he could kill it again immediately instead of either waiting for the pack to respawn, or travel to another location to find another pack. By limiting how often you can switch layers, the ability to exploit the additional resources layers makes available is mitigated.
---
I hate these posts. People act like this wasn't a thing during vanilla, that there weren't countless videos of mages two, sometimes one, shotting people in BGs and world PvP. Like there weren't AoE grinding methods for Mages or Paladins. 
---
Mages are strong, everyone knew this, it isn't going to change.
---
Dude, it's written by real world humans, using real human values and ideas, hence the "human nature".
---
Or just go to wow-petopia. They have everything.
---
This is how I've always understood it as well
---
Turn vsync off. Wow doesn't seem to recognize higher framerate screens
---
I’ve been trying to convince my Tauren friend to keep a stack or two of milk to give away individual units to others as fresh squeezed. He felt weird about it. Guess I’ll have to alt a cow  some people just aren’t built for RP
---
Lmao just wait for when warriors will be needing all rogue/hunter gear in the 50 dungeons lol
---
Play the old trispec.  You get blastwave, imp coc, and imp arcane explosion.  You have a fairly high burst on about a 30sec cd but it's all shotgun range.  Your damage is all instant so you can stay mobile. It worked quite well when I ran it years ago.
---
You guys didn't have a tank?
---
I don't think you realize just how shit gear was before the rework. 1.12 talents are night and day compared to early vanilla.
---
You can literally play just as fine with 15-20 skills/macros and yet you see people still with 5 stacks of skills lol. Drives me bonkers. I love to see as much as my screen as possible so I can appreciate this. Good job.
---
Well, effectively yes. They were placeholder, albeit unreachable, until the content went live, albeit redesigned.
---
If your trying to get the jump on somebody, hunter's mark kind of defeats the purpose, the extra damage isn't worth it unless you are mid fight and most abilities are on CD.
---
Hit 30 yesterday and got by whirmwind axe right away. Never felt so powerfull before! Sweeping strike and cleave with a weapon like that is brutal
---
well i have 6 days 23 hours played so yeah its a bit longer than i hoped for haha :P
---
You must have played pre 1.12.
---
Adding `/startattack` to macros can turn on your auto attack. 
---
Example:
---
    #showtooltip 
---
    /cast Sinister Strike
---
    /startattack
---
The Riposte version mentioned by someone else here would look like this:
---
   
---
    #showtooltip Sinister Strike 
---
    /cast Riposte
---
Note: `#showtooltip` shows the first skill in the macro, or whichever skill is listed after it, as long as you pick the `?` icon. So I specified it for the 2nd macro since I didn’t want Riposte to be the icon/tooltip. 
---
I’m sure an official Rogue guide would have many more useful macros and probably better versions of the ones listed above.
---
Because you’re playing the game differently then they do, so it’s lame. That’s how this subreddit works.
---
I’m pretty sure the parry ends a Warrior Career

Lol what? Is that a thing?

---
Old Ironjaw was added in patch 2.3
---
This.

 i already have disabled VSYNC in the options

But that's almost exactly what the arrow looks like in classic.

Yes, at level 15 that is the best thing you could spend your time working towards :)
---
I want there to be an Oh Shit! for OwO please
---
Why do you have 5 level 1 warriors? I'm assuming the two in Orgrimmar are bank alts, but what about the others?
---
Oi! I'm lvl 15, and I *need* to min/max right now!
---
Wow how did i not notice the tool tip lol, thanks for that.  And sadly I don't think I can go to hillsbrad without getting destroyed by horde.  Thanks though!
---
Hey man I’m just liked you, have around 2 days clocked in as a lvl 22 warrior. I have no idea if that’s a normal lvl speed for a warrior lmao but I’m havin so much fun along the way. This game is all I can think about now, it’s the only game I’ve been playing for the past week....I honestly need some help
---
Top kek
---
Yeh I already edited, sorry
---
There's no wrong way to do it. Conventional wisdom is that questing is fastest if you are solo, rather than having to get groups together (who might suck) and run to difficult to reach dungeons over and over. But, I think a lot of people playing right now have really missed the doing dungeons like these, and people who can do them fast can make killer experience. 
---
Doing dungeons helps you have better gear, which begets doing better dungeons - whereas having a bunch of dumpy greens from 10 levels ago might make it hard to do some of the dungeons later, so it's good to run all of them at least once or twice. Plus they are fun.
---
I didn’t say aren’t, scrubby. Against classes that can kite they will not win a 1on1 though if the other player is not totally retarded.
---
Perfect i'm in duskwood now. I'll try that at 27, thanks!
---
Go to system (or interface) don't remember which and raise your cap
---
This is the norm on german and european realms. This is how it was 15 years ago on european realms and 12 years ago on german realms (Ambossar, Frostwolf &amp; Aegwynn) when I played on them
---
Bro go do SFK lol, I’m leave 24 with 3 rings!

The book of tradeskill unlearning in the Tanaris hut?
---
I'm confused so you are using display port? Look in your display settings in the nvidia panel and it will tell you if your display is running in 144hz.
---
Lol I already commented why I used my phone but it was deleted I guess. I like the way it looks better on the phone because it feels more old school/classic, like it was actually taken in 2004.
---
Nice trick.  Keep in mind you can also make green gear with tailoring.  So if the price of linen cloth is lower than what you need to make a profit on strange dust then you can buyout cheap linen cloth to disenchant tailoring gear and get free skill ups.  Same thing with wool cloth and silk, etc.
---
Holy shit I forgot all about it. It was my favourite addon in BC.

Dont bother, these cringe kids cant socialise irl so they tbink everyone in game has to do it. Even if its a joke.
---
Skeram?
---
Not sure why you cannot if you have checked everything people say.. as mine run fine with 144hz .. it can only be because of one of the steps mentioned above
---
Because no one cares if you want to equip. Selling will give them also an upgrade.
---

I can gladly heal a dungeon on my druid. But when I quest and level up otherwise I go catform, and I'm heavily specced into feral. So ofcourse I will need on leather with agi/str/stam. What I won't do tho is need on int stuff unless my dps's don't need it.
---
You're entitled to that opinion, I'm just coming from the angle that if the chat is too fast, or you're not in the zone but want to do the dungeon and other use cases like that it could be helpful for some sort of bare bones LFG way to hook players up for dungeons, but not like in the retail format where it just smashes 5 randoms together via teleport and teleports them out at the end.
---
It doesn't really matter what you want if your CPU or GPU can't handle it. What hardware do you have?
---
You should be happy it does this for you. In my time you could only fly individual legs. You'd have to stop at each flight Master and do the path navigation yourself.
---
[Here's a more minimalistic UI](https://imgur.com/Q8pZr6X). It only requires the [ElvUI addon](https://www.tukui.org/classic-addons.php?id=2). You can just import [my profile](https://pastebin.com/j1iVX5kZ).
---
If you go on retail go to profiles and export it then click export now and it will give a bunch of text, copy it all then go into classic and under the same profile area click import and paste the text in there
---
Epic times my friend :)
---
No clue how that is relevant to using Fireball to get him out of stealth or not but sure hahaha
---
Of you're not in a safe area there is a 20 second delay on logout, idk if altf4 works the same way but you usually aren't moving when you alt+f4, and the layer swap happens instantly on group accept so if he joined a group on a different layer prior to combat there never would have been combat
---
I'm new at priest.  If you are using ranked spells how do you lay out the hotbar?!   I only have numbers so it seems it would be extremely confusing lol
---
Guarantee you they were trolls, especially being that blatant. A lot of people _hate_ roleplayers, they found a group that's even "nerdier" than they are and do everything in their power to mock or belittle us to make themselves feel superior, especially if they can promote the stereotype that all RP is just ERP.
---
This ain't a retail guide though, is it? :)
---
How else is he going to heal dungeons while lvling? Need gear for it more then talents.
---
I like UD Female anims better but the god damn model outside of that is ehh
---
A good hunter will remove it and re-apply as needed. Rogue caught out should never win vs hunter.
---
you can find atlas on curseforge, but i actually am looking for the same thing and atlas's classic version is actually a module for retail so all the dungeons are the newer versions. maybe one of the old private server addons site like legacywow would have a working one though.
---
What do you need to know? Simply find your World of Warcraft folder on your pc, copy it over to a usb stick. Bring that to work, and move the files to your computer. Bypass the battle.net / auto updater which requires admin access, by launching the wow.exe directly, which is located in the classic folder.
---
Only downside to this, is that once an update has been pushed to the game, you’ll have to update your usb once again, with all the new files.
---
Yeah it's pretty shit that they never implemented it like a proper mesh network.

---
This doesn't make sense to me, Why have a "greed" button then?
---
Ideally it should be legitimate RP but the lack of queues has attracted tons of nonRPers or people who actively hate it and want to make fun of it. They're trying to promote the stereotype that all RP is just ERP.
---
I simply loved the old writing, it gave the factions and races a much more realistic and flawed depiction. It didn't revere war, it often showed you the fallout of the old wars and their impact on the enviornment and wildlife. These old quests gave life and structure to zones and every time I've finished a long chain, it felt worth it. If not always for the reward, but for the great journey it put me on.
---
You need to read everything. Hunters are the only class capable of both of these things.
---
A warrior and rouge can't kite me, but they can chase me down. A warlock may kite me, but can't chase me down.

---
Yes, check out TradeSkillMaster for classic. This addon will build up your server's price database whenever you use the auction house and also use its own sourcing information for prices. Great addon, used it a lot on retail back in the day to make gold for tokens.
---
If anyone has ever played Grim Dawn, that game has the best flavor text on items. So many of them crack me up. There are like Mid-High Level pants called "Pretty Great Pants" and then a late game craftable item called "Really Great Pants." The flavor text on the latter is "Turns out...still okay."
---
It's absolutely duplicating resources.  You can argue that the duplication for a short period of time will have no lasting effect, but it's definitely creating more resources currently because more resources can and are being farmed as a result of it.
---
At first I thought you were referring to 'a needle in a haystack' 😀

Unless they changed things from vanilla, he should have a 1.0 attack speed, making Broken Tooth the best individual DPS pet until ZG.
---
That's quite anecdotal, but how nice for your friend. :)
---
Why? You will have gold from BoE and buy some gear from AH, its upgrade for that person who win... We always need on BoEs even with guild dungeon runs. Ooooonly if its big of a deal for someone for at least 10+ levels, we will let him have the item and rest of us pass. But if its some shitty blue (small boost over green item), you better sell it.
---
It was an absolute blast lol. We were very excited, if you couldn't tell lmfao
---
That's nothing. I'm training people at my job that were born in the same year that I started at the company.
---
We had that in Vanilla and we have it in Classic.
---
It's the LookingForGroup channel.
---
It's compartmentalized, it's straightforward, and it's global. The only improvements I think that could be made without watering it down too much are separating it into dungeon versus raid, having it default to a distinct color, limiting it to dungeons you are eligible (+/- a few levels) for, and making it a default channel.
---
yeah something is wrong for sure, maybe settings, maybe me, or maybe the game \^\^
---
my question is - why not just have two options, roll or pass?
---
I think I made someone else’s KOS list. My buddy and I were duoquesting in Desolace and ran into a gnome warrior named Littleperson and ganked him when he was low (he was 3 levels above us). We ran into him later and sniped him before trying to kill an elite. He came back to kill is while we fought it and we managed to slay him again. For good measure we picked him off again when he rez’d and we ran into him three more times over the next two hours. Poor guy was probably traumatized
---
Is it cause hes black

Before reading this, remind yourself what YOU think the reason flight masters were buffed. (Guards were not buffed in original WoW, other than the addition of thief catchers in capital cities.) I should note, I tried to see if there was a patch note of when they were non-elite. All I see is that they were changed from 55 elite to 80 elite in patch 3.0.2. They might have been non-elite at some point, but they were never level 60 during original WoW (the ones I checked are 55 in Classic). Apparently, they were lvl 65 in TBC though, not 55. Sources:

So, you have your reason decided for why they might have been buffed?
---
Here is mine: there were more players at lvl 60, in a lot better gear than when the game launched. Maybe even better gear than the devs expected when WoW launched. All I could find on this topic was a note:
---
&gt;Most of the non-class set items that dropped from Molten Core and  Onyxia have had their effective levels increased, resulting in higher  DPS weapons, and/or better stats and effects.

WoW's devs didn't really design the game for lvl 60, but for leveling. As point in fact, the blue dungeon sets for casters had zero +spelldamage or healing. If epic sets had been the same way, of course, then melee and hunter damage would have increased while caster damage did not.
---
So, if flight masters were buffed from non-elite to elite, it was because there were a bunch of players at lvl 60 and they were able to nuke down flightmasters before their adds could kill them, or could even just kill the elite adds outright.
---
What's your explanation for why they were (possibly) buffed?
---
If it's on wowhead I think that's just how the maps are for now. Just wanted to provide context
---
So what do you call her in game? Mom?
---
It's true as well. NEs, who were saved by both the Tauren and High Elves, betrayed them both and exiled the High Elves after the invasion of Nordrassil. They wrote their troll lineage out of history books, instead referring to their ancestors as elven, selfishly keeping other tribes from approaching the Well of Eternity for their own personal gain.
---
I agree abusing it is a bad idea for your own fun (i don't abuse it), but I don't see how that means you can't complain. The game has a feature that's best for minmaxing, so you use it. Because you minmax, you can't complain?
---
Ugh, that makes me rage. I still remember back in Vanilla, this warrior rolled need on Triune Amulet in scarlet monastery (amulet with 7 int/7 sta/7 spirit), and won it over me + another caster.
---
He thought it was a good item for him.
---
Hardest thing is to get the group to understand that you have no taunt. Then again its tye same thing with all groups "Gimme two seconds to get aggro."
---
Will this picture just get reposted every 3 months and get 4k upvotes?😅
---
That's right. And no matter what, many folks are going to want the next expansion. And no matter what, many of the people who either do not want the next expansion right now or have no opinion on the matter will want the next expansion after 15 months of classic.
---
The only question is, will blizzard also be opening more New Classic servers along with progressing current servers to burning Crusade at the same time? It's definitely possible.
---
Just wait until people are sporting Ahn’Qiraj gear.  The epitome of "cool" design.  Who doesn't want to look like they are sporting Technicolor bug parts all over themselves.
---
My priest is level 21 I hit fortitude on everyone I see, even hunter pets, every paladin and druid I pass buffs me in return. One druid even apologized because he couldn't refresh my mark since a stronger one was active.
---
Of all the mages I've given fortitude to, I've had intellect exactly once.
---
So what I'm saying is, it's good to know some good mages are out there.
---
Ooo I can prob help with this.
---
I believe you have multiple monitors? Turn off Mirrored Monitor on any monitor (even if it's not your primary) and it should work.
---
Yeah... The non stop memes and streamer spam in general chat keeps breaking my nostalgia
---
AFAIK WoW runs in borderless window mode which means HZ rate depends on nvidia/windows settings and NOT ingame settings. Id suggest checking out Nvidia/Windows settings and confirm it is set to 144hz.
---
Heh, I was in a run that bailed before we even got to the portal because this warlock was rolling need on BOE greens he couldn't equip. His reasoning was that he was an enchanter, and "needed" them to d/e. 
---
His friend backed him up, and me and the two others disagreed and ported out.
---
Dude... what?
---
Martharion?
---
"The Kill List" on my desktop is specifically all the gnomes I have slaughtered. 
---
I plan to also add memorable non-gnomes. 
---
But I hate gnomes, and every open-world gnome I am going ti add to it. Sadly I dont actually see many gnomes on thalnos...
---
Lol, no. We were running two voidwalkers. Works surprisingly well.
---
\*Cough* mapster
---
No, I mean the specific people whose threads annoyed this person but they were too cowardly to reply to those threads.
---
Waste of two keybinds when a macro can do both of those things in one.
---
Only do them to help another profession.
---
You wont make any money from them for another 3 months atleast.
---
You swap between stances. Throwing shouts/revenge/Saunders in defensive and SS, overpower and thunderclaps in battle.
---
Yeah, that was a 3 hour run last night, it was rough lol. Thanks though! I will let our priest know!
---
hehe my brother rp's on the ships. He strips down, goes on a box, starts dancing and ask for tips ;-) He also mostly gets tips!
---
Mfw dumbasses think shamans use agi. Agi does nothing for enhance besides dodge and crit. It doesn’t even give 1 AP
---
This. It's not worth it. USB ports are often disabled for good reason.
---
&gt; It's more like wanting to control the person who you split up with after the relationship is ended, as well as the person they're with. Nobody fucking asked.
---
Well since you won't be leveling engineering with either skinning or herbalism you may as well take both skinning and herbalism
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones\_by\_level](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level)

Maybe worth updating or adding this list :) 
---
Anyway great guide for new players Thumbs up :)
---
Oh god, here we go
---
Yeah great logic everyone ninja loot then no one is a ninja looter anymore ... na thx such people won't get into my group.
---
"Rolls need to sell it for gold at level 60 instead of giving it to a person that could equip it and level faster right in that moment"
---
Thinking about it in that way doesnt really faze me tbh.
---
I’m on stalaag which is usually full at night but I haven’t had a queue more than 30 minutes or so
---
&gt;it is a iiyama GB2760QSU-B1. it can 144hz.

 it is a iiyama GB2760QSU-B1. it can 144hz.  + NV GTX 1080 +i7 8700k + 16GB RAM \^\^
---
wall running doesn't work (i think) u still go afk and and removed
---
Yeah and the default rule is selling is greed roll and equiping is need.
---
It's from Cataclysm
---
Because senior management will lose their shit if they can't waste time on Facebook in the middle of the day
---
oh yeah that 0.1% being faster is so important!
---
If you use Baron Geddon as an example. It has 1 mechanic. You get a bomb on you. You run out of the group. Don't pretend like it's rocket science.
---
This is kind of amazing... Thanks for that.
---
A bit of both.
---
Nah, I just take my revenge on every friendly horde I see now. No more mister nice guy now. Some high levels just ruin it for the rest of them.
---
Oh, i just will see you throwing and change my aspect while its flying towards me. Then after the hit i will change aspect again. Rogue dead 123.
---
Not for BoE
---
You're absolutely right. Most of the quest text in Classic is FAR superior to what followed, especially better than the grasp that Cata replaced it with.
---
I had forgotten, but just on the first few I did, I felt the difference deep in my bones, like the hearing the voice of an old friend.
---
A warriror.
---
Looking for the expert cooking book?
---
It doesn't create resources. Those resources were already created. It just means instead of four people farming resources across four layers, one person gets them all. It doesn't increase the amount of resources, just concentrates them on to one person.
---
&gt; I love when random people suggest there is an "easy fix" to problems that dozens of world-class software engineers at blizzard haven't thought of and discarded.
---
In the history of world of warcraft development, Blizzard has sometimes taken AGES to implement very obvious, easy fixes. The company's internal decision making processes appear to be somewhat dysfunctional. Which isn't actually a surprise, because that is true for most large companies to a significant degree.
---
k
---
Why is this so “easy”?
---
I didn't, no. Doesn't change anything though. Feed me some more downvotes, bootlickers.
---
I'm on Gehennas-EU and yesterday visited Barrens. It was pretty much quiet compared to launch week. Even at launch week I was able to do it pretty easily. Thing is to group up with other peoples and you have done those leaders in no time.
---
This has been the case for nearly every mmo I've ever played. End game content sure be max level, before that nah. Most of these folk have never even touched a healer in their lives.
---
And I loot you. And I skin you. And I farm you.
---
I’ve been yelling about this in general chat during corpse runs since launch
---
I'm very thealous :)

Yep. Always played Alliance on Moonglade but on Hydraxian Waterfords I’ve gone Horde - namely to play a shaman.
---
I don't feel guilty. Blackrock horde was a bunch of mouthbreathing rejects hellbent on going out of their way to grief, who couldn't raid their way out of a paper bag.
---
You are in the wrong sorry bud.
---
well no point in argueing with a ninja that would end up on my blacklist anyways
---
Once again the hubris of the alliance is proven
---
Well it sounds like you already found the solution to somebody not inviting you to their group for any number of reasons. You make your own group. Which you did. So I guess, vague post complain thread achieved?
---
Why lol
---
Sounds like the toxic community of Overwatch.
---
I just uninstalled it.
---
This and other options will follow during the weekend. Had not much time to work on it this week and a lot of other things to handle for this page :)
---
That's what I did to farm for my mount.
---
Worked better than I thought.
---
Purple is a better colour. Thats why I play a Night Elf.
---
The troll tusks will take a lot of time solo at level 30. Get a group and do the other troll STV quests at the same time, and you can knock it out pretty easy.
---
Now you need the wabbajack
---
once i hit 24, im coming to hillsbrad!
---
I think the ones up north are the Broken Isles
---
So ehm, what's a layer?
---
Your voidwalker is so thyk 🤤
---
It's not the cost of 3/3 imp blizz, it's the fact that for PvP you take Frostbite as control is king in vanilla PvP and shatter as damage / burst potential is very much your goal. When you take an AoE spec you NEVER take frostbite and a lot of builds don't take shatter as Blizzard can't crit.
---
You can definitely find a middle ground, but you're going to lose a ton of fights you wouldn't otherwise because you're lacking Frostbite.
---
I’m defining those criteria for you to answer the question, since you said lay out concrete criteria to measure if the economy gets worse.
---
RIP to your fingers
---
Just get some from mages. I haven’t had to buy water yet. I just trade buffs for water at flight points or boats.
---
"DAE retail bad?" humor still going strong. I can't wait for this shit to die so people can appreciate Classic for what it is, and not what it isn't.
---
No changes tho!
---
there's a flight path in Western Plague Lands, but you might die to bears.
---
Which addon are you referring to?
---
If it's the one that was posted yesterday about hashing /who results then that's bullshit from a technical perspective. It's also addressed by a blue post.
---
Abusing is the keyword here. Complaining about something you are contributing to is hypocrite imo
---
What's wrong with you two? This got hostile so quickly. You guys wouldn't speak this way to each other in person. Find some common ground.
---
Does she have big tits
---
If you dont know already, One thing you must understand is they are vastly different games in 2 ways. 
---
Grinding is everything in RS. Every skill is achieved by doing the same mindless thing for hours on end. In wow it is only used to fill in the holes for exp/leveling.
---
Usually, In RS, a quest is a long drawn out production resulting in a cool unique reward and maybe a tiny ammount of skill exp. in wow they are short tasks which are your main source of xp (and new gear).
---
Not really the answers you were looking for but just wanted you to know the approach to the game is totally different. Good luck!
---
It's not just autorun, it's most likely a 3rd party software
---
By picking alliance, you actually didn't commit treason. The horde aren't civilized enough to understand real loyalty to a legitimate ruler.
---
Stopped watching after i realized how stupid he is  after his metro video, that shit was just sad to watch.
---
It’s a 100% the racials, but don’t care. Tauren Shaman for life.
---
Man, those underwater quests in Desolace are a pain, but they used to always be some of my favorites. I did them on every character. Really hated what became of Desolace after Cata.
---
You can use a 2 hander in defensive stance.
---
if you don't like it, then run.
---
\#nochanges
---
This actually worked for me, can confirm 100%. Someone else has to take your "old" name though, you can't do it yourself.
---
How are all these people hitting 60 so fast? Just spamming dungeons?
---
That is a shame! Think they fixed that in wraith though maybe make a ticket about it?
---
You don't have to use a shield to be in defence stance though? You swap back and forth, you don't sit in one stance the whole time.
---
These are based on different character names, not players/accounts.
---
I recommend getting Leatrix maps, you can downsize the minimap and it shows all undiscovered locations with a 'fog of war'.
---
Is he in stealth with the parrot? Is a roleplaying server? Sounds gooood
---
Congratulations on your company
---
People were saying for weeks before launch not to use world chat for this very reason but no one wants to listen because they're used to it and lazy.
---
Ouch..
---
This is just the "new" blizzard way. Deny the problem when it's clearly there... 
---
Yesterday my quest mob was stolen because some random dudes popped out from an other layer and started spam AOE while I was waiting for my quest mob. You can guess who take the mob. -.-'
---
Just completely remove layering and we are good to go.
---
While I do enjoy Classic more than I ever expected I must say I do enjoy retail more than ever since BfA released, because classic shows me daily how much I love many many many of the retail features and QoL things.   
---
Classic is as enjoyable as painful xD Mob respawns compared toplayers are a nightmare atm :)
---
There is a difference?
---
Shield is great for dps and is instant. I use it if I don’t think the tank will survive the flash heal cast time but that’s pretty rare.
---
You need to shut up
---
Thanks! I'd imagine once you use TSM your WoW goal shifts from making it to endgame to be the market king haha.
---
Thing is its easy karma. "No one" is going back to a fake bank post and downvote it
---
Perks of not playing Horde scum I guess.
---
Also shamans can give you a 10min buff, although they need mats for it.
---
I think sharing gear should be more than just rolling need if you need. I play druid, of course I need both healing and feral gear. But if that fancy robe drops I always inspect mages/priest/warlocks first. If they have decent gear I will roll need. But if that poor guy is running green robe 20 levels from past of course I will just pass loot.
---
But of course I do get point of this. As druid I do need to upgrade to sets of gear. It might sound unfair that I roll for more loot than DPS classes but I think it's justified as I have agreed to heal you. But as I said rolling for gear is never black and white. I am lucky that I usually can get full premade for my dungeon runs so we can discuss who gets item. But this should be standard way to share loot even on leveling dungeons.
---
You mean like when the nobles refused to help Lordaeron with the scourge invasion initially because they wanted to divvy up the land amongst themselves? Or when they refused to pay Van Cleef after he'd rebuilt Stormwind? Or maybe you mean how the NEs abandoned the Tauren in their time of need, allowing their homeland to be destroyed, or their exile of the High Elves who defeated the scourge invasion with the use of blood magic when nothing else worked?
---
Are you questing or are you spamming dungeons?
---
Wrong!
---
That shot happened in retail when Thrall went off to "find himself" and is not canon here.
---
Thrall is 5x the leader that any other character is.
---
Haha that’s my companion parrot, Yogurt. I’m on a normal server :)
---
Oh shit, people born when wow came out are now 15. That's wild.
---
It's as intended for classic I won't have too worry about it once I have a mount
---
#JustPriestThings
---
We used addons like this during vanilla. So it kinda replicates the feeling more accurately for me.
---
Female tauren actually have a taller collision box. There was a period where they couldn't even enter the room where the MC attunement NPC was.
---
I don't see an option for profiles... I downloaded elvui from this [forum on tukui..](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6233)
---
Starting at level 10 you get one talent point every level.
---
My question is.  How did you find people that all have separate lives with different schedules that have obviously been able to log on at exactly the same time and duration to hit 40 altogether? 
---
It's awesome and I'm jealous lol.  Gratz!!
---
Grats :) Keep up and in a bit ur a whirlwind-axe wielder too :D
---
So your alt character can still exist in the world while your main character is in it too? How is that possible?
---
Naah, still can kill alot of mobs
---
There’s always one of these dinguses in every conversation.
---
LOOK AT ALL THAT MITHRIL! 169 mining and counting..
---
Agi is less valuable in vanilla than in tbc, but it's ok. Str and crit are the focus anyway
---
It's a cat so it should be able to.  Unless only certain cats can?
---
Definitely was fishing while drinking coffee before work this morning too.
---
just send sucubus, dot up + fear and /laugh
---
I play mage im probably doing something wrong but it's going slow as shit to lvl and i get killed much easier then other classes
---
Yeah I also don’t see the point of taking a screen picture with your phone while you can just simply printscreen on the pc.
---

Cool, thank you.
---
I can’t remember the FP, but there’s one where you fly *past* your destination within inches of the gryffin, up to the next point, and back to the destination.
---
Well you need the Shield for many abilities tho. Might be worth trying to swap weapons with a macro i guess.
---
But for stance dancing you need to be a arms warrior so you dont lose your rage when doing so.
---
Now try to get WW Axe at lvl 30 on PVP server ;)
---
It's just you I appreciate them.
---
Understandable! 😅
---
God. I've read so many threads on people bitching about this. Who gives a flying FUCK if someone gets classic gold for real life money. If that's something you actually care about, please stop playing wow and find a new hobby, because I feel very sorry for you.
---
Thats because a lot of mobs will hex (polymorph.) If I remember correctly warlock's felhunter can dispel the hex a lot of the mobs there cast. When I last ran it on a pserver I had felhunter out to silence and eat hexes off the tank and healer.
---
If you can't find a mage or a lock, bring a group with a designated off tank and off healer or plenty of interrupts. People get obsessed with the best way to do things as soon as they find out there is one. Personally I like to find whichever way works with whatever group I can get and find that more interesting.
---
What on Earth is this..?
---
 I don't see an option for profiles... I downloaded elvui from this [forum on tukui..](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6233)
---
I’m suggesting that. Fucked if I can remember that far back. But slow spawn rates were a huge issue back then, so maybe. However, even if Blizzard has just buffed them for Classic, it’s still an acceptable thing to do.
---
Engi makes your character strong and the other professions make your wallet strong.
---
Did you spend much on skills?
---
I disagree, that is yellow not orange.
---
The common ground is we both play classic.
---
It's by definition NOT ninja looting if everyone agrees to the rules ahead of time.  It may not be nice, or the best upgrade it could be, but one thing it's not is ninja looting.  
---
You can insist that everyone rolls greed on BoE they're not equipping, but that just makes it easy for an actual ninja to snag the item (ie rolling need if everyone had agreed on greed rolls ahead of time).  Like it or not, it's just less drama if you remove one source of arguments.
---
"Fucking hell just let me die already!"
---
You mark me and I am going to run out of sight, wait it out.  Then come back, kill you, and corpse camp you until you take rez sickness.  
---
You might be a little bit more careful with your marks.
---
Just roll a shaman, mages will run when they see you coming, this is your aoe spot now
---
On a per mob basis you will kill them faster than any other combination
---
Can you post a screenshot?
---
That looks like tukui not elvui?
---
There's a star player from &lt;Txz's minion&gt; who was there for the kill, but wasn't there for the screenshot.
---
Ah yes, now I remember why I didn't make another warrior...
---
I wonder where Bellygrub has it's graveyard? Westfall maybe?
---
Its because people in general are probably 10x better at video games than they were back in the day.
---
Case closed.
---
Also, everything is already mapped out so that helps immensely.
---
No, the difficulty is more or less in overcoming the tedium and time requirements, not in clearing the content. 
---
MC especially is super easy.
---
That said, the guild that cleared MC in a week has been doing this for years, regularly, on private servers. 
---
I hesitate to use this analogy, but it’s like looking at the world first race in mythic AP and saying the content must be easy because Method or whatever cleared it in a week. 
---
Now, I hesitate to use this because end game content today is *much* harder, but the average group is still going to have more difficulty than people who’ve been doing this seriously for over a decade.
---
&gt; was it normal back then, that a guild would go MC with people in the raid not even being level 60?
---
No. They also didn't practice on pservers for years to be able to do this. It's also not the norm now, those people are few.
---
Well, yes some parts of the game, like raising is mechanically easier. That being said you have to invest a lot more time like you mentioned.
---
East coaster? I live in San Diego. It’s a mere 11:34 PM over here. I still have all night!
---
Short answer yes. The earlier tiers of raiding by no means required anywhere near 40 fully 'optimised' level 60 players
---
Indeed.
---
So you think it's fine to control someone, or want to control them, if you ARE in a relationship with them? You seem to think it's important that I haven't played WoW Classic (but did play original WoW).
---
&gt;It's more like wanting to control the person who you split up with after  the relationship is ended, as well as the person they're with.
---
Is your issue that I suggest improvements to Classic, or I am not subscribed to WoW (which allows access to both BFA and Classic)?
---
&gt;I said you don't understand why it was changed.
---
You don't care to tell me why YOU think it was changed, so you must not feel that reason is important. If I'm wrong, say why flight masters were possibly changed to be elite, which is different from the reason I said.
---
thats Weakaura go to  [https://wago.io/classic-weakauras](https://wago.io/classic-weakauras)  for premade ones thats where i found the one i use!
---
It's weird seeing people shit on retail also
---
I played the first month of legion and quit wow after that, didn't play bfa at all.
---
I came back to try classic and all I see is people trying to act superior over people who play retail.
---
It's amazing that people actually try to use what video game they play to one up others, someone in real life needs to tell them it doesn't make them special and no one gives a shit
---
You're literally just restating exactly the things they proved were lies in the exact same way
---
That’s actually a good idea, maybe!
---
Not that chill about it 
---
"AWE WHAT THE F#6$ IS THIS CRAp" pukes in mouth as mashing alt-f4

Nice! I've been stopping and giving people greens after checking if they need them. Typically if I back track to herb. People are always pumped, it's good stuff.

You can play wow in vr with vorpx

Go west, young man, go west!

Thank you very much indeed. I've woken up feeling much better today. I will pay it forward indeed, thank you.
---
Not to my knowledge, if it's a cat you should be good to go. When you tamed the other cat that knows dash, are you sure you learned it? You have to keep the new tiger happy and use it for a few minutes first. Best way is to tame it, feed it to happy, turn off all other auto abilities on the cat except dash and farm with it for like 10m.

I prefer whatever the highest dps pew bang shooty thing is.

I didnt know YOU played wow too Micheal J Fox

I remember the pic with a chart for roomates to mark when they fed the cat because he was begging for food from all of them and got fat.
---
The DPS does not change. He has a faster attack speed but lower damage.

For nine months.

Ashenvale is the DayZ of Wow classic

You have more progress 1-8 than you did going from Legion to BfA.

New abilities, bigger HP, outleveling mobs

As long as it’s more like Silverpine/Shadowfang 2.0 and less like FurryTown.

I’d like to keep the playable races limited to something more grounded and realistic.

My favorite pet in the game!

Chased down an undead warlock into some caves, when i got to the cave he was just standing in the middle of it, he waved at me and switched  layers....i was so mad.
---

---
Real followers of the old gods wouldn't stop at three...
---
MC was difficult because people were clueless back in the day, at least compared to how they are now with 15 years of experience. As long as most of those people stay alive I guess it doesn't matter if they're a few levels short with 35++ others compensating that small lack of levels with all that experience. 
---
Clay sculpting is probably difficult the first week in as well and your attempt at a vase will probably look like a hollow pasta tube, but I'm pretty sure you can make a pretty nice vase after 15 years of sculpting.
---
it's a pretty disgraceful market tactic to do so though.  Another player coming along and breaking up the cartel is a great example of economics.
---
That's until a rogue 100 to 0s them in a perma-lock combo.
---
Fun fact every class has its spotlight of bullshit in classic. Mages just get's noticed more because people play it more often.
---
Same for me got to level 3, boom headshot
---
Most people won't get the reference.
---
So have everyone on one layer? So those random dudes are just gonna dark circles around you AND actively deny you the ability to farm, ALL THE TIME?
---
Is there a list of recommended minimum levels to do each dungeon?  All I can really find are level ranges, which are pretty disconnected from what it actually takes to get a pug together.  (Personally, I'm up to 32 now, so I am more interested in things after Gnomeregan)
---
[Here is a gif I made.](https://i.gyazo.com/cfebda715773fb0ce415ddcb9e735eec.mp4)  Not sure if I am missing something obvious and I'm dumb or maybe a bug.
---
&gt;You can argue that increased demand by more players will compensate for this.   Regardless of whether that's true or not there are still more resources being generated.  
---
And more people to buy them therefore effect on economy is nil.
---
I am now done explaining basic supply and demand to you as I have now rephrased it three times and now I can't think of a simpler way to explain it short of resorting to crayons so idk keep thinking however you want champ
---
Disregarding your bait:
---
&gt; You seem to think it's important that I haven't played WoW Classic (but did play original WoW).
---
If you don't know what you're talking about, then yes. It's important.
---
&gt; Blurb
---
See above
---
&gt; You don't care to tell me
---
I've stated it multiple times. Regardless of your intentions, it would be used for griefing. You can stop trolling now.
---
It's not that bad. I get maybe 1 or 2 times per day when some PvP pro who is 10+ lvls above the area comes to prove he's not shit at PvP, the rest of the time it's usually fine, with some few skirmishes among equal lvl players, which is manageable as Warrior as long as your gear is fine.
---
Hunters, Mages and Warlocks will be the bane of your existence until you get Intercept, though.
---
Wait you guys get it in Ashenvale!? I had to sneak halfway across Desolace at lvl 22 to get ours...
---
The stigma against solo specced healers in 5 mans is because some people rock up trying to heal in full agility gear or don't know to down rank heals and whatnot. Hybrid classes should hold on to a few decent pieces of int or spirit gear. Just holding on to quest items and drops you get while levelling for a B tier healing set makes a massive difference. You don't realize the healer is a prot paladin when he is wearing full cloth.
---
Wrong way round. You level Gnomish first as everything there is BoP then you level goblin
---
Dead server?
---
Good, it shouldn't be in the game yet.
---
That’s Druid gear
---
\*laughs in engineer\*
---
Big brain plays bois! Good deal.
---
Warriors, shamans and even hunters I don't let into my groups. Sorry guys but after losing Strike of the Hydra to a hunter I'm not taking any chances. IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE STATS JUST A MELEE PROC WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ROLL NEED ON IT!?
---
Good luck stunlocking a Mage with Blink and Iceblock
---
The raid speech in log horizon is straight up WoW references
---
Something to consider... bag space is precious, so two gathering proffessions will increase the frequency you need to go back to a hub. Bank space also isn't endless.
---
I planned started out very breifly with skinning/herbalism but swapped to skinning/leatherworking. Has been a lot of fun leveling LW and setting goals to make gear for myself. I wouldnt discount the ability to make money with crafting professions either. Many quests need items from professions, people want gear to help fill crappy slots and in some cases I've found shuffles for small profits, etc. 
---
Moral of the story, do what you think you will enjoy. I swapped because I thought I would enjoy having a crafting profession to level and don't regret it one bit
---
Great response but doesn't change that 50% of my guild chat is people asking for layer invites. If I remember right retail's phasing only functioned if you are in the same zone. I don't get why the layers would not function like that too.
---
I see nothing wrong here
---
We don’t? We get ice lance and pet. And after that we get deep freeze, a disgustingly broken stun with a 40 yard range.
---
What an absolute Chad
---
They are raiding with a guide. It's always easier when you've been doing it for a decade.
---
Yes. We didn't think so at the time because we sucked donkey dick at the game and Melee played the game in First person staring at the floor during Ragnaros to get more than 2FPS.
---
But yes. MC and Ony were always easy as fuck. BWL has a few bosses that require some skill and co-ordination but it is also pretty easy
---
Imagine raiding like this lol
---
Definitely was not the first. Guild on Westfall was banned on the second day.
---
At work and unable to open the s/s due to restrictions
---
Same here, can be frustrating, especially if you've just burned down a mob, because a patrol is about to add, and then your pat just waits in that spot.
---
People who are hitting 60 already are playing the game at dangerously unhealthy levels.
---
That’s a fact, not opinion.
---
Imagine being this clueless.
---
A lisp and a stutter, poor guy.
---
600 spirit with spirit tap. Thats is the good stuff
---
wow my bad. i thought they were the same thing.. i gotta go look again lol
---

Ah. thanks.  This is the answer I was looking for.  Thanks very much.

Hi, /u/RareHotdogEnthusiast
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d0d17u/what_unit_frame_addon_does_esfand_use/). 
---
What interface are you using??
---
Soo much fun pvp’ing in classic, crazy burst damage and quick fights.
---
 I've seen many references to this movie and at this point I'm afraid to ask.
---
I have to put a blanket over my screen when I sleep cause my cat try’s stretches it to try to wake me up
---
So the logic you have here is ‘he’s profiting so who cares?’ Which is absurdly dehumanizing.
---
No problem, TIL as well
---
Negative. All Blizzard cares about is the device that's running the game. How you access that device, whether it's sitting at the desk or using Remote Desktop, is irrelevant to Blizzard.
---
Now using said device to keep yourself online without manual input.. that's a different story.
---
As a guide it's fantastic.
---
As an addon - it has some neat features but it's very bloated.  It causes some interface errors sometimes and there's no way to completely disable parts of it (i.e. it's not modular).  You can uncheck some stuff but they just make it really difficult for you to disable stuff you don't want.  An addon of this extreme size ought to be modular with gold guide, dungeon guide, talent guide, profession guide, etc, it should be possible to just remove stuff completely but it's not that simple.  Other than that, the guides and features are legendary.  You just have to make sure to disable the addon when you aren't using it cos it will definitely slow down your system.
---
Cool idea.  If you're like me and use something like Adibags or Bagnon and don't know your slot #s, this will do the same using item names:
---
    
---
    /equip [noequipped:Fishing Pole,mod:shift] Fishing Pole; [mod:shift] Demolition Hammer
---
    /use [mod:ctrl] Shiny Bauble
---
    /use [mod:ctrl] Fishing Pole
---
    /cast [nomod] Fishing
---
On the downside, you have to update the macro every time you get a new Fishing Pole, weapon, or lure.
---
Our Guild has a ‘Kill list’ for particularly bad offenders.
---
I find it so interesting when new memes gets mixed in with mechanics and situations almost 15 years old.
---
I don the shield if things get hot and I need to use block or shield wall, or I need to keep interrupting casts. But a 2h will give me more threat and damage, and more rage per swing. Most warriors will take anger management and tactical mastery anyways whether leveling or at 60. All warriors are expected to stance dance to an extent, especially when you start getting berserker stance abilities.
---
You forgot that they also get portals to every city which is incredibly useful in vanilla.
---
Ok, so you're saying that if flight masters were changed to be elite (there is no hard evidence whether they were elite when WoW launched or not), then the reason was that Blizzard realized that people killed flight masters too much, and decided that flight masters should have been elite since the very beginning?
---
If this is what you think, you could be right.
---
Out of curiosity, do you consider ANY time a quest-giving NPC is killed in Classic WoW to not be griefing? Defining griefing as an interaction involving two players in which one player forcefully and negatively affects the gameplay of another player.
---
On private server the points seemed bugged. Maybe that’s what is happening here.
---
Has nothing to do with ease.  The game is super casual.  It’s just all time gated with neckbeard levels of grind.  
---
The people rushing to 60 to flex their validation is kinda sad, really.
---
Staff from Ironaya might work if you don't have better weapon yet, staff with stun proc from ZF is actually a good warrior weapon.
---
Because Rio de Janeiro
---
It's a script, you have to do a /run macro. 
---
Can't remember it off the top of my head but if you type into Google, WoW Remove Gryphon Script can't imagine you'd go far wrong!
---
My "true classic experience" was running around like an idiot not knowing what the fuck I was doing but, I was with my friends (who also didn't know wtf they were doing), I had a big 2h weapon, I could heal and, most importantly, I was having a kick ass time!
---
Now I know what I'm doing and where to go, my friends and I are back (except Jason and my ex - long story), I'm running around with an int/spi staff, I'm still healing and still having a kick ass time. With work, family and adult responsibilities now, that kick ass time is much more limited but, I'm still having a kick ass time.
---
Part of the experience or everyone was that there were no guides, there wasn't [Noxxic](https://www.noxxic.com/wow/) where you could just look up what the best way to play was.
---
A lot of people didn't know what mods were or were slow to get them.
---
You learned a raid boss's mechanics by dying to it and adapting.
---
In 2019 it's more or less been solved.
---
do you have a link for elvui for classic?
---
Wind shear for the the win!
---
That explains it. 😄 Cheers bud!
---
Just skin and vendor skins. AH markup is not worth the hassle to set up auctions. Easy money.
---
Just spent 4+ hours x2 days LFG uldaman while questing out in the world. All I saw in lfg for 40+ was SM &amp; ZF cleave groups. got some dps a few times, and a healer. All the tanks I talked to just wanted to cleave xp farm.
---
It's always been hard to find tanks but its discouraging.
---
Part of me is tempted to roll an alt until my guild catches up but other than not being able to do dungeon quests i'm having fun so I don't want to stop.
---
Idk, is Golemagg a dead server?
---
Grab the one for classic: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gryphons-remover/files
---
I take it you've never faced a rogue? Cause they open with a stun and then follow it up with a blind... so when you blink away you're still locked and if you ice block out they'll just vanish and sap you.
---
Yep basically also to sell stuff on the AH without having to run your main back
---
Haha fuck I love it.
---
“LF mage RFK”
---
*suddenly appears*
---
You rang?
---
Wow, thank you for this detail answer :)
---
&gt; I canceled my sub until PVP launches because I can enjoy my 1-60 playthrough and level up a twink alt to 29 and gear him out. I'll be back for the twink scene, not the 60 scene. I've already missed out on all the exploits and bugs to get the advantage and keep up.
---
I understood your point until this.
---
You are complaining about people having BiS raid gear in battle ground at level 60 and that being unbalanced and unreasonable, but you are happily planning to twink at lvl29 which is the very definition of imbalance of power compared to normal players at this bracket.
---
Quite frankly, I'm beginning to think that you just absolutely hate the idea of someone having better gear / having the upper hand against you in PVP, but you don't mind at all when you have the better gear and upper hand...
---
Hold on hold on hold on. Are you really trying to tell me that Darnassus and Orgrimmar are worse than the absolute abomination that is Undercity???
---
Just wait til some teenagers almost bump into you and say:"oh sorry, sir"
---
Inner voice:"Sir? I'm only... Twice as old as you" Cries in old
---
Any decipher for the letters?
---
Less than 10 layers per server. So why orgrimmar feel so empty ? I barely see 10 people on the bank in a full realm.
---
Where do you work?
---
I have never understood why people can't just let other people enjoy things.
---
Majority of his posts are about suicide. Super sad to read.
---
I am the tank so no I just hate that dps wont give me 2 seconds to build threat or attack the skull
---
Those programs are often detectable and bannable.
---
There’s even a handicapped person who got banned for having accessibility software
---
They're still great at pvp but warlocks are better at basically everything in pve in tbc.
---
zperl from willitclassic
---
Man, as one of the higher lvls on bigglesworth, I don’t think we downing rag any time soon
---
Thanks. When it comes to hot bars I always do everything I can to reduce it down as much as possible. Anything I won't need in combat can sit on a hidden bar, I don't even like having more keybinds than I need to, hence stuff like Decursive.
---
I said what I said. Stop trying to interpret it.
---
Thanks for your thoughts and insight guys. I haven't reached 60 yet and me and my guild didn't try any raids yet, so I was just curious to ask people who can compare all of this better than I could.
---
That what work week feels since Classic
---
But does the speef matter that much? With weapon speed normalization being a thing?
---
mapster is my friend!
---
I've found that upgrading bows while leveling actually doesn't help my DPS as much as I thought it would, and I'm better off saving gold. This [cheatsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cvgl0c/made_this_hunter_cheat_sheet_for_myself_but/) has a list of bows for leveling. Hunters really aren't gear dependant.
---
&gt; Alexsensual is probably the dumbest sack of shit I have ever had the displeasure of clicking on a piece of content from.
---
Agreed.
---
Of course it doesn't.  Addons can't automatically cancel shapeshift forms.  You can do it in a macro /cancelform and an addon could show you a button (click to cancel shapeshift) but addons can't cancel shapeshift automatically.  It just isn't allowed.
---
Warriors are really topping. Why? :D
---
Would explain why some mobs respawn insanely fast... their graveyard is nearby.
---
As cool as it sounds, as a fellow warlock, I still prefer to have every spell in my bar
---
 sometimes a spell can resist and you need to recast it, sometimes you fave elementals immune to fire so it's useless to cast immolate, sometimes even with the drain taking build i prefer to finish a fleeing npc with the wand instead drainlife/soul
---
Agreed, OP. It’s like raping and then protesting against rape.
---
Its 1.12 patch.
---
It's not just people are older and better. Then game is just easier
---
I forgot... apparently people don't know how to pvp O.o
---
Yes you're absolutely right, I've never faced a rogue.
---
Fury warriors wear a shitton of leather in endgame.
---
This change came in TBC iirc. Athene run around Zangarmarsh tagging mobs and had a group kill the mobs for him which made him levelup pretty damn quick.
---
aliance gets it in ashenvale, horde in desolace
---
This is actually such a calming and good post from Blizzard. There's always so much made up information going around and being spread as legitimate.
---
Okay thanks. So it doesn't matter if the device is me playing using an Xbox controller and Steam Link on my phone?
---
Nah I don't but I found it just by googling it
---
Only because they did doesn’t mean it will be easy. Casuals will still struggle with 40ppl.
---
The effect would be nil if supply and demand scaled completely linearly based on player number, which they don't for a number of reasons.  Did it really never occur to you to wonder why servers with different sized populations often have varied economies?
---
Twitch and wow interface are 2 sites. 
---
View them all!!

[check](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d05kp7/i_just_got_drive_by_knock_knocked/ez8kvka)
---
&gt; •	⁠Blood Elves/Draenei
---
No playable Blood Elves. They ruined the Horde. Draenei are strange to have among the traditional Alliance types.
---
I’d say make Blood Elves and Draenei should be separate factions much like the centaur factions in Desolace except they’ll actually give good rewards this time.
---
Instead maybe a High Elf Exiles faction for the Alliance and add Goblins/Ogres to the Horde. Except not make the Goblins too cartoony. Keep them grounded like the Gnomes.
---
Speaking of cartoony, please no playable Pandaren. They’ve always been a joke race.
---
&gt;Death Knights
---
Lore explanation should be better. And it should be restricted by race.
---
Reroll?
---
Forgive me if what you said was unclear.
---
\&gt;What's your explanation for why they were (possibly) buffed?
---
\&gt;say why flight masters were possibly changed to be elite,
---
\&gt;Regardless of your intentions, it would be used for griefing.
---
Is that a typo or does the 11 mean somthing???
---
Is there a macro to unequip gear? 
---
Ex: you are about to die and you unequip in order to save durability cost.
---
All druids get faerie fire, which is castable outside of a form and costs mana.  There is a talent in feral spec that creates a seperate version of the spell which is castable in cat or bear form, and has no cost but a cooldown instead.  That second version, I believe, will follow the rule of only being able to use the best rank, whereas the one that costs mana has all ranks available.
---
So did Dobby’s ‘wand’
---
Maybe you hit level 60 too hard?
---
Kame Hame Ha !!
---
i'm also only 19. The pace of classic/vanilla is much slower. the people that are max level have likely been practicing on private servers. don't worry about what level others are at, enjoy the game and have fun :D
---
I always run towards a healer, if they dont help me im taking them down with me! 
---
A corps run with a ghost next to you is better theb alone!

Hi, /u/Vizier_Thoth
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d0d6pk/i_swear_this_game_hates_me_sometimes/). 
---
You'd use spirt/intellect mail gear. Till plate. Leather spirt/intellect gear if you have. Cloth is 2 steps below what you can use.
---
Wont work but go for it
---
&gt; You're worried that a group, or possibly a raid, of lvl 30 players would be able to kill the flight master before they were killed by the flight master's adds?
---
With current kiting mechanics it'd be entirely possible. People would ensure it happened until it was changed.
---
&gt; I presume that you have some knowledge that flight masters do respawn in less than half an hour in WoW Classic
---
I've sat in XR long enough with a dead flight master to know that the respawn was 30 minutes for certain, yeah.
---
That’s fine but if you’re into PvP it’s simply ruined.
---
But can you explain why, when flying from Theramore to Stonetalon Mountains, my character flies PAST Stonetalon Mountains, all the way up to Darkshore JUST to return back to Stonetalon. In this case you don't have the direct connection, I have the direct connection, it even flies OVER the flight master in Stonetalon, but the flight dude guy still feels like I should be going to Darkshore first... mildly annoying hahaha
---
The people at max level and who are raiding both play SIGNIFICANTLY more and typically leveled in groups, which is way more efficient ( for dungeons AND quests ). Seriously, check your /played and realize that it's probably less than what they have put in in a day.
---
fellow double agents unite!
---
Level 36, got my first necklace from a quest yesterday. I cried a little.
---
And many of the classic Community came back for both classic and BC. And many also came back because they expect BC in the future and want to get started on the characters now. Anyway, blizzard was always going to start at the beginning. It's literally the only thing that makes sense. And following that, each successive expansion, because players will always want to continue their time investment. That or start over again at the very beginning, as the private server community did over and over.
---
People don't even know what Classic Plus means, aside from keep your dirty dirty flying out of my wow. Kind of silly.
---
Great sportsball reference!
---
Contact support
---
Apparently Healadins are shit for levelling.
---
Thats a fucking good guild name
---
Calculations depend on whether Arcane Crystal is 5% per 3 seconds or 5% per whole node.
---
And of course everything else is true, but difficult to account for.
---
&gt;Mirage Raceway has been added!
---
I got it from their discord.  I don't have it offhand, but you could google it.
---
i just dont see how u get away with only 12 visible buttons.  do your other combat bars show up in combat?
---
I keep a set of cloth/ leather/ whatever has best stats for healing in dungeons, but you don’t want to be out in the world where you have to melee wearing cloth
---
You can't kill which is already dead.
---
No. This is not the same. This is a problem on Blizzard's end. It's like asking someone to meet you on the 50th floor then expecting them to take the stairs when the elevator is right there. 
---
I don't layer abuse but I still find layering to be dumb. Just trying to find players on your same server is a hassle. It completely breaks immersion when we are in the same spot but then realize we are on separate layers.  Players also just constantly fade in and out of existence. If they're going to do that, it should at least be phasing players out of my vision.
---
Jeez dude thanks for rubbing it in
---
I'll see what I can do, only really have my phone for recording video.
---
Same here. Though if I'm tanking, I don't roll on caster gear. Feels kinda dickish to run in there as a druid and just scoop up everything.
---
Layering bad
---
However it's a snapshot of the measurement moment. But, since n=15.000 you have a decent indication i'd say.
---
This is a waste a waste of time. China is a completely different team
---
sooooo,  can we have more than single digit layers for phase 1 please? Still experencing 6 hour queues on secondary realms.
---
I play druid and get whispers asking me to tank all the time. I have no idea how they find my name.
---
My 1-handed axe is 102, I'm level 25 hitting a level 26. Is that not high enough?
---
What happens to loot? Only the one who got him there had it? Was it something valuable?
---
hahaha wot
---
I'm level 25 killing level 26 mobs
---
yep. enjoy the ride. 
---
a good number of the people who have already cleared MC have leveled characters to 60 many times. they used well established leveling plans that are maximally efficient and they probably played almost nonstop for however many days it took them to go from 1-60. 
---
if this is your first time, it may take you the better part of 8 weeks to hit max level.
---
Fuck me, well would you look at that!
---
Hit up the young panthers in northern Stranglethorn Vale. Make sure you have skinning and vendor all the skins and greys. That can yield pretty good gold per hour.
---
You can't fix all mechanics. Sometimes you just need people to be civil. This also is a concept not hard to understand. You can still mesh under cities but you're not allowed
---
Wait SexyMap does this?
---
Where?
---
Oee thats dirty!
---
There *very* little relevant leather, mail and plate healing gear during leveling.
---
Good thing is that your healer likely won't have much overlap with what a DPS wants.
---
Mograine is pretty good. Couple of twats but majority really nice
---
What the fuck am I looking at here
---
Can u teach me that kind of Power?  
---
I mean for real, can u give me tips? I bet maybe about 3 level and full cleared none.  
---
Loved this mini game back then.
---
haha so true. if you're a lock and you do this you should do corruption though, it's going to be much more helpful to the person, curse of agony takes forever to actually do damage. ofc if you wanna spend 2 GCDs and the mana while running by you can do both
---
This guy sounds like he's from the NRA. Guns don't kill people...
---
Also I should mention I was plat s1 and diamond from s2-s5 in league, I only get on for urf once of twice a year now, but I know that game like the back of my hand :)
---
By the time I was done with the first 2 panther and tiger quests I had skins worth almost 5 gold
---
It’s what makes it great. And because the servers are nice and busy usually you can roll up to a hard quest and, if you ask nicely, easily get some help. I just politely asked a nice couple of gnomes to help me take down Morben Fel and they were happy to oblige. It’s the crucial element of WoW that got lost by Blizzard
---
Zygor is good if you want to pay for it. And of course [Joanna’s Leveling guide](https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.php) . As well as all those mentioned.
---
Depends entirely on your daily time schedule. How long time a day can you play? Do you have kids? Other daily activities? Family visits?
---
I work 10-15h a day and started playing last Sunday. Add eventual family visits and there's really not much time left to play. I got to level 22 yesterday and while it feels slow, I really enjoy it.
---
Don't look at others and just do your thing :)
---
This is working as intended, max out your weapon skill.
---
Look at those RP names.
---
Foenixius, the Mighty.
---
Delimicus, the Devout.
---
bLaP.
---
The people at 60 did so with either playing 24/7, an extremely streamlined route meant for speed leveling, abused layering/dungeon raids, and/or AOE mob grinding. The average time to hit level 60 back in original was like 10d+ played. Seeing as 1.12 is the nerfed version even if you figure 5 days played at 4 hours a day you'll get there in a month.
---
*Print Screen*
---
That was at least creative
---
That isnt what my posts have been about?
---
They about how it's *going* to effect it.
---
Please quote where I've said "the economy is already fucked"
---
I am wearing this on my lvl 25 warrior until I get a statstick
---
&gt; The AoE grinding mages take full advantage of this to gather huge mob packs in their pulls.
---
https://youtu.be/3O_pNDc73MM?t=689
---
I'm not focusing on RP at all at the moment, just leveling. I bet its the same for a lot of people. It'll come in time. That being said I have seen quite a lot already, but also a lót of non-rp names and shittalk in /s so meh
---
Its easier to keep track of things when you send the same style materials to only one char. I for example have bank for cloths, ores, bars, random shit and herbs. This way I dont have to scroll my bank over and over again when I'm looking for something particular.
---
Look at the ability in current rank and new rank.  Then ask yourself:
---
Do i really need my wingclip to snare for 5% more at this current time? Is it worth the 1g at this Level or can it wait? 
---
Do i really need Raptors strike to deal 30 more damage? I am a hunter after all, and if im considering how i spend my gold - i should also be playing optimally - there for i Will skip raptor strike.  
---
And so on, learn to evalute for yourself what you need.
---
Is the Talent "Winter's Chill" from the Frost Tree (Mage) bugged or am I misunderstanding the wording?    
---
&gt;Gives your Frost damage spells a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to apply the Winter's Chill effect, which increases the chance a frost spell will critically hit the target by 2% for 15 sec. Stacks up to 5 times.   
---
I got 5/5 in it by now but haven't seen even one 5stack so far. Doesn't matter which frost abilities I use (FB spam, Blizzard AoE grind, etc.)   
---
Usually, I only apply 1-3 stacks (if any at all). So is this a bug or what am I missing?    
---
Also, with blizzard for example (with 100% chance to apply) I can have a few mobs with 0 stacks while others have 1-3 stacks in the same pull (with blizzard).  How?
---
Doesn't matter much but from my long experience, I can say that mics are the first to crack on a gaming headset.
---
Say "classic" with a heavy lisp.
---
Well, here you have a reason.
---
Check that the subscription is on the correct wow account (eg. Wow1, wow2 etc..)
---
People usually expect you to roll for loot for the role you play. Same reason that I don't scoop up caster loot as a feral druid, despite healing from time to time.
---
40 man raid completed with less than half that. Try completing a max level raid on retail with only half a group
---
This only exists for retail wow. Classic is trying to stay true to how the game was 15 years ago and there was no companion app then :)
---
So far on herbalism iv been -1g profit. I make potions and give them away.
---
NEWSFLASH: I’m playing Warrior/tank lol. Every group Iv been in has been my group. Iv only ran into 2 of these rogues that clam the chest as there own and I don’t give a fuck. I find it hilarious because everyone usually loses there minds over it hahaha. Go ahead kick the rogue... good luck with the next locked chest lol
---
It is definitely expected for them to unlock and let everyone roll... BUT 
---
It’s not ninja looting if literally no other player in the party has access to the items... it’s simply his call if he want to share. If you want to roll go buy some damn keys lol. Otherwise hope the rogue is feeling generous when he unlocks the chest and sees the epic. If you are being a dick about it he’s probably going hearth out of the dungeon laughing his ass off regardless of the rolls
---
The person who received the loot holds it until everyone does /roll. Then he trades it to the winner. That's what is meant by reroll.
---

---
Been in the Barrens all day and here is yet another dead wife shout out.
---
1. How do I get Neatplates to show enemy level in nameplate? Don't see that in the options anywhere.
---
2. Any idea why I'm getting an error with Details and it is failing to load after I reloaded UI and reinstalled 5 times?
---
*laughs in feral*
---
How would you do damage or kill things
---
You wouldn't
---
I just tested in-game.
---
I pulled a mob and killed it:  120 XP
---
I pulled the same mob, brought it down to about half life, and then let a non-party member kill it:  70 XP
---
your post says 
---
&gt;staggering amounts of gold
---
where is your evidence?
---
And this is news how? Zoomers make an immature guild name, zoomers get banned. Done.
---
We know, it's just so much rage was built up over not being able to build rage to get aggro we have to let it out somewhere!

How do you get gold for this?

huh.. i recognize this picture from [Destron's Travelogue ](https://destron.blogspot.com/2007/10/silverpine-forest.html)
---
Also also, his rotation isn't even correct as far as the order you would want for max dps (which, assuming you're going to all this trouble, you probably care about), and also you don't really shadowbolt for most of the leveling process, you use your wand or life tap + drain life once you have dots up.
---
Classic PvP &gt; All.
---
they just search for druids on level X in location Y in the social tab? :P
---
In retrospect, some things are just inevitable.
---
That's a thing?
---
LOL!  
---
Btw. what's that addon to keep track of the level times ? I need at least some control over my life..
---
No, you are just being retarded and missing the fact the there HAS been 15 years and private server with which people could hone skills, addons that make questing and raiding far easier than it was...game has not changed the people and the tools they use have.
---
I have one. I call it my Shit List. I have one for team killers in Rainbow Six too.

Rock elementals in badlands give nice vendor trash, ogres nearby are the next best.
---
You are very welcome. I have plenty of time for commenting because this crappy old computer isn't any good for much more. I'm not getting to play Classic until I can get a new machine. Hopefully soon. So watching others play and lurking on the subreddit is all I can do for now.
---
Defence influenses hit chance though, not damage (unless glancing.)
---
hardcasting shadowbolt to level, LULW
---
Just let him die. Sooner or later he'll realize he's not a streamer - let's just hope he doesn't start AFKing 10 seconds into each pull "to be on the safe side".
---
Thunderfury is a newer PvP server, so the community is a lot of salty refugees who abandoned a main on a high queue server as well as the typical PvP crowd, tryhards and griefers are present in higher numbers. 
---
I’m on mankrik, a normal server, and the community thus far has been fantastic.
---
Looks like this one:

What's DVT?
---
How do you have 3 gold at 33?
---
Quests were designed as guidelines and supplements, not core exp growth.
---
They basically just exist to say "hey, this is a good spot to grind for your level---We'll even give you a small bonus just to nudge you in the right direction"
---
Level as ret until you have your talents sorted. Then go full healing. I will level this way then gather healing gear for running dungeons.
---
Trust me! Levelling as pure holy is slooooow
---
if you enjoy it, why not?
---
For some reason the Flying Tiger Goggles look weird and buggy on female orcs, anyone have a idea why? Has this always been a bug?

Loved the tension, how you took your time, checking each steed.
---
I've not seen many GMs, but the ones I've seen have had different cool outfits. I remember one was a gnome dressed like Mario
---
yeah, thats very likely a coincidence
---
Yep we do this every night.  Help people and receive help from people.  
---
It's really nice and nostalgic, I wasn't expecting this
---
This. Maybe next time read before you post. Sorry.
---
Spent 15g on mats for Whirlwind quest and im pretty poor lol
---
Great UI. Minimal and unintrusive, and also stays with the "flavor" of vanilla. Nothing stands out or tries to remake the feel of the original Warcraft UI. Thanks for sharing. If you could, could you upload your WTF/SavedVariables somewhere for this UI? I would love to play with it, and I think it's better than anything I could come up with on my own.
---
Only the gods know
---
1hr  mail delivery sucks tho
---
If you look at the "cool bois" streaming you'll see plenty of people doing cleave style SM runs and other stuff. The fact that this may not be a viable strategy on lower level dungeons or the fact that all tanks (or healers) are not accustomed to this doesn't seem to have occurred to some DPSs.
---
Why don’t you see the point of useing the printscreen button?
---
Haha salty refugees. That makes sense, since that's what happened to me haha.
---
Never played on a normal server. What'd the difference?
---
and you know they are doing this because of layer exploits how? maybe they just farmed?
---
that doesn't mean you have to be cynical, a congratz would be enough like 'congratz on the new pet
---
/who druid 30-34 arathi
---
Play around with that. Everything after /who can be changed to what'd be appropriate for the thing you're looking for.
---
Yeah it's honestly gonna be a struggle at 40 lol
---
I think the PvP part of the realm is a big factor. I'm on the only straight RP realm and I run into RPers literally everywhere I go. I can't do an hour or two of questing without having at least one in character interaction with a stranger.
---
have you selected the right region?
---
Okay, thank you so much! Still saves spaces to assign other stuff and keeps thinks less cluttered! And if I make it so all things cast max rank at lets say 1, then all rank 2s are shift and rank 1s are cntr it’ll be super easy to remember, and have many MANY things macro. You just made my shaman UI so much easier to look at!
---
I've had a warlock do this to a target I sheeped while I was low health. Thanks, buddy.
---
Said this to someone else, I already had reddit open on my phone so it was quicker and more convenient to just take the picture there. You can still see what I'm trying to show just fine.
---
That's the good thing about classic there ain't no best build. It depends on how u wanna play :) Aoe farming or single target. Most likely s. Th. With frost but Google is your friend.
---
Yeah you can keep the leather for later use or gold gain. Alternatively you could go for a combo, get the 2/2 devilsaur and 3/5 black dragonscale. That is probably what i'll do. Doing so will give you shittons of AP, 3% hit chance,  and 4% crit chance. Then again, there are items from dungeons and stuff that are better.
---
I'm just jealous lol; I've got 2 days played on a lvl 30 druid. Congrats mate!
---
You don't have to play a tank, you just won't be invited to groups and people will be pissy when you're LF tank. Raid gear in vanilla was some of the best for pvp.
---
Shit don’t last forever.  Enjoy life.
---
That's cool. Nobody said otherwise. Not everything needs to be about your agenda.
---
Just think, if/once we get to TBC you can be a pally tank once you get to Hyjal :)  then you get to have your armor explode off you twice a night due to durability loss and pay some insane repair bills :P
---
Too bad that arcane crystal thing was bullshit.
---
I did that once back in the day when I was like 18-19, back in high school, when I had all the time in the world and thought I would get them back. Now I wouldn't bother with lists and whatever... feels kinda petty and cheap.
---
But you have Inconvenienced me by having to look at that god awful picture.
---
Sit in ah they can go werry low, i picked up all pages for like 3s each.

---
Is this information about XP accurate for this new WoW Classic? Would this mean I should really only kill mobs at my same level for speed leveling?
---
&gt; Ideally you should kill mobs of the same level, as they grant 100% of their base XP rewards. If a mob is 1 level higher you will only gain a portion of its base XP reward. This effect also works in reverse and even more radically. If you are killing a mob that is even 1 level below, you will gain 10-20% less xp.
---
Check out deadmines, but I think the level req might be a bit higher than 21. Gl!
---
Played mainly humans and night elves for the past 12 years, decided to try undead warlock in classic
---
Dumped my OC Arugal Horde side data, 37k horde characters so far logged.
---
SM grinds. Had 110g at Level 36.
---
Wouldn’t make a lick of difference. You still wouldn’t be able to use copyrighted names. 
---
I love the outrage you’re trying to generate by being all edgy. I, too was like that when I was 18.
---
I have different hardware, ISP, and modem/router, so it's probably not that. I don't get so much as a hiccup when it happens either. I go from perfect game interaction right into the login screen.
---
Being a good hunter involves quite a bit.  You have to understand that pretty much every other class brings more to the group than you do, so you should compensate for that by always being aware of the situations and responding.  
---
Use your tracking to warn of approaching patrols, put your pet on mobs that peel off to attack the healer, turning growl on and off as needed, properly train your pet and bring one that benefits the groups (wolves with howl), etc. Being able respond when shit hits the fan with kiting extra mobs, misdirecting to the tank, or having your pet off tank make you infinitely more valuable.
---
I guess it is.. If you like to fuck flies, as we say in Denmark. I see it mostly as a reason for saving time it isnt that way, not so much for everyone getting fair shares. 
---
Chests contain a wide variety of useful items, and in a perfect group, rolls shouldnt even be necessary. If theres a green or blue item everyone should roll for that item specifically imo.  
---
And honestly rogue lockpicking is a class ability like everyone elses which make you more enticing to bring groups. Im a warlock, should i not summon you after you forgot repairs because i spend time farming my shards (that time adds up you know) and start charging group members for every little entitled helpful action. I guess you can but its probably be hurtful to you in the long run.
---
You didn't have to look at it. You didn't have to spend your time writing those comments. Just move along.
---
Who would even start both against a very good bears D?
---
Are you okay there buddy?
---
Untill you run out of mana and a warrior bursting with rage two shots your ass back to the spirit healer.
---
Actually the lyric is “Don’t make me eat shit.”

try this site  [https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/)
---
I’ve never watched him or know anything about him. But if people are willing to just trade gold or anything else is it really just his fault ? It’s not like he’s holding them up for robbery... lol
---
Lol, at least I'm not the only one who wasted a morning levelling fishing!
---
A healer that knows what he is doing and knows the dungeon layout (or has common sense if he doesn't know it by heart), yes.
---
I don't think everyone in classic has been around for 15 years, though, how to distinguish the old hands from the people still learning? Many of the new people might favor DPS over healing, but surely not all.
---
Try bringing a few levels lower player who's still learning, and maybe doesn't know the dungeon layout and inadvertently pulls some mobs from behind the corner since he's trying to stay at the heels of the tank and bodypulls due to the level differential. 
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm just highlighting one of the risks some people probably see when putting together their group.
---
Already been proven that the arcanite crystal and black lotus screenshots were fakes. But please keep believing everything you see on the internet.
---
Excellent work, keep it up sir!
---
At this point why not just play a priest haha fuck me.
---
Rogue or Mage for mostly pvp and a little bit pve?
---
I dump your ass
---
is that luffa on the top right? respect
---
I belive it's the AoE farm he was complaining about. Mages can pull so much and just aoe it down fairly easily to farm gold/items. Much more efficient than doing it in a party where you share both the xp and loot.
---
don't really think many ppl will transfer from mograine
---
super chill confy realm with high pop, low queues and good balance
---
Stalagg as alliance and so far everyone has been great. Helps each other with quests, buffs, orderly lines at server launch for staring zone. Good times!

You literally blinked yourself out of existence xD

And disable it
---
Two viable roles is more than what most hybrids get.
---
I'd put my money on a re-release schedule similar to the original release schedule with maybe a 3-6 month bump in releases to kill the dead periods right before retail expansion releases.  This'll bring back nostalgics for each expansion and keep people playing.  
---
I imagine they'll look at the numbers for classic players over time and just create per expansion capped servers, then you can play whatever expansion you're feeling, or commit to the most.  
---
Who knows though, sounds smart to me though.
---
actually I got some ppl mad for not inviting them because they were low level (tanks and dps)
---
GL killing last boss @ ST with a 5x50lvl grp
---
I made a thread for people to share census info and they just buried it
---
If you happen to be a Shaman (since you have those handy macros), what unitframes addon are you using for group/future raid healing? 
---
Long time Grid user myself, but have not found an updated version of it thus far.
---
I actually have a macro set up almost the exact same as this, but instead of only refreshing on new target I have it set to reset every 3 seconds, which lets me make it through my rotation then immediately resets. I have been doing corruption&gt;coa&gt;immolate so I put coa and immolate on my bar in case they get resisted.
---
Well yes but he’s specifically responding to the comment that talks about abusing layering, which every class is capable of.
---
Destination servers are dead on arrival, get bamboozled boys
---
*Technically*, it was.
---
Stealing loot from hunters. Big crime.
---
Not sure which exactly you are talking about right now
---
So what they are saying is, rogue or mage, rogue if you'd like to have possibly the worst playthrough of the game in that, you will be the most played class, you will be one of the lowest tiered levelers and, you will have a hell of a time competing groups/gear throughout the game. Of course, they also mention mage, the greatest fucking thing to happen to World of Warcraft. But, you do you.
---
Its gonna go like this. You provide no utility that a tank doesnt provide so people wont take you over say a rogue. Youre going to compete with the tank for gear so any group lfm that doesnt have a druid tank isnt going to want you. And you might be unable to build your own group because youll scare other tanks away.  Its easy for a tank to find another group so they wont blink twice turning your group down. 
---
While your dps is certainly more than viable, you in fact bring less utility than a retadin or boomkin, two common "meme" specs. You may have luck getting into a "cleave" group that only cares about dps, but youll be in a party with other warriors and wont get gear that way, unless you dont care. 
---
Its not all doom and gloom. After all, leveling as prot is a slow choice, most people who play warrior do so as arms or fury at low levels. Even while tanking. And they make it to 60 so you could too. 
---
If a group takes you though, or you get a tank, both of which can happen of course just less likely than a rogue or something, be mindful and courteous. (IE assume no priority on any gear unless your group is a druid and 3 mages)
---
So... Even worse :D
---
Can't have fun if you can't lvl slow amirite?
---
Good thing that guy had blue eyes.
---
Mapster is great too.
---
Bring it lmao. I'm no PvP god, but if you need a blacklist you can't be very good :p
---
Your still thinking of pre 1.12 patch... lol
---
Unrelated to macros, I don't see why you'd want to open with CoA.
---
If you Shadow bolt first and then CoA, you'll have a SB on its way the moment you aggro the mob. Additionally, you can throw Immolate between those two spells, so that by the time the mob even gets to you, there's two dots on him + that SB hit.
---
before the storm is a book written WAY down the line to force that narrative.
---
when you need to reference lore that hasn't been written at the point we are discussing your point seems weak.
---
just because one story has been written doesn't mean no other progression of the story can be imagined.
---
How does no stance work? It will only cast if you are not in battle stance? Is 1 battle stance and 2 defensive stance?
---
I don't, because I'm a Warrior.
---
Whitemane is about 45% alliance 55% horde. Better join the alliance though. Also longest queue times available.
---
What’s that horrible whining noise? Can anyone else hear it?
---
Apes is an experienced private server guild who has done vanilla content over and over for years.
---
Blizzard gave them an easier version of the game in phase 1 then what they're used too. Private server scaling is also higher.
---
Don't change the point of conversation once you've run out of stupid points to make because your not informed well. It makes you looks silly.
---

---
Oy he rolling dat Feralas Fadeleaf.
---
You get used to the Packers letting you down.
---
Wew he took a route 10 minute longer, he's so stupid!
---
Not me though, here I am on the internet berating people on having fun!
---
I suspect it's because all the people who played WoW back when it was new were teenagers and early 20s who despaired at the griefers and the toxic behaviour. Now they've come back to Classic they're all willing to at least be neighbourly! I don't remember people being this nice back when I was playing WotLK!
---
I seriously can't go anywhere at the moment without people offering to group up or just randomly buffing me as I pass. Just last night, I was doing the last phase of "Defense of the King's Lands" in Loch Modan and having real trouble with getting past the Seers to take on the Shamans and the Bonebreakers (Who were tough enough by themselves!) when a couple of full groups and a Mage who grouped up with me came through. The groups didn't get in each others' way, divided up targets evenly, helped each other out and made the mission a pleasure! 
---
A toast to friendly players!
---
I just filled it at level 32 last night on my warrior. Forgot to buy arrows though  so fuck it. 
---
Iv just been taking the deaths and killing 1-2 mobs at a time.
---
The DPS in classic right now are just awful 90% of the runs I've been in. I think having shamans makes it even worse! I can't tell if it's then earth shocking but I can barely keep aggro off them if they are dpsing.
---
No the parrot is the date obviously
---
Guild Information page is soley for putting in names of players that are Kill on Sight.
---
Any warrior that is looking for tank is not as a good warrior in any guild or server. Not because they can't do the job or don't have the skills but because they refuse to do something they don't like.
---
As a dps warrior you sometimes need to sacrifice doing dps to help the group / raid out. Unwilling to do that job always puts you at an disadvantage.. Any dps warrior that is willing to tank when necessary is favored by all when it comes to invites to groups and raids!
---
This means that it is up to yourself to how you experience vanilla. If you tank you will see and experience more compared to just doing dps. This at the same time hooks back into PvE gear for Pvp. Like said before some of the best PvE gear is used in Pvp, so I would say raiding is necessary unless you are grinding for rank 14 which is a minimum of 6-9 weeks 16 hour day grinding (if not more)..
---
Recently 29 reporting for duty!
---
My DD character is secretly super horny and just needs to be prodded, partly as a joke to myself. Nearly 70 hours /played and nobody has propositioned her
---
Maybe people just don't like gnomes
---
That quest can only be gotten when you are dead,
---
Has layering been hotfixed already? I haven’t tried to use the mechanic until today and the invites were not letting me switch over freely.
---
&gt; Yes a lfg addon or function would break the game so no it should not be in the game.
---
No it wouldn't lol, it all depends how it is implemented. Please tell me how aa LFG such as one pre TBC patch, where you could only list your group, or list yourself, would affect the game, given no automation.
---
Not sure if a Kill On Sight addon has been made for classic but back in the day I usually used them for that purpose.
---
Hunter might be good, easy to learn and hsrd to later. The only thing I worry about is controlling the pet. Especially with the bad ai and weird pathing in dungeons. Other than that I think it might be good, lots of room for error with hunters while grinding and questing.
---
ide keep them. you can make a decent chunk of cash making bags right now depending on your server.
---
really wish I picked it up but I'm too deep with skinning/mining
---
I call those people "Challengers".
---
I’m lvl 36 almost 37 with only 32 gold. How on earth do I get enough for my mount?
---
Hard no from me. I see plenty of people at even the most random of hours. If your playing off-peak hours in 50+ zones, that’s why it’s empty. I’m not shocked at all.

Hahahha that S4 episode was wild!

Word! Life is awesome. Definitely hooked on my lvl 30 orc warrior though.

It's ok, when BWL gets released and steamrolled in 1 hour you'll say it's a fake clear too, because you're delusional. Too hard for you to admit that vanilla was easy, i understand.

However... getting a side by side screenshot will be hard because she was wearing pre texture giantstalker :S

Thunderpuff
---
I've just done that.  It's particularly relevant.  The horde quests there are relatively garbage, spartan, and don't help you find anything.  I think there may be 10 quests total in the zone for horde.
---
A pure gold coin wouldn't last very long in circulation
---
I did it for my realm to help our guild decide if we should move with the character transfer. To get the data: when you are in the queue if you change realm then reconnect to the same realm it will flash up the total number of people in the queue. I just did that every 15 minutes.

Are you alliance? If yes grab the add on called allyroute, its super helpful to get the most out of your game time because it ignores quests that are totally not worth the time.

This was the case in Vanilla too. People usually set ridiculous requirements for low level dungeons.
---
Kill on bike
---
It _is_ being exploited, just not to the degree that some people claimed.  People are constantly asking for invites so they can shift layers to farm vendors for rare plans/get a new set of mobs to mow down/get nodes refreshed.

Yes, because things like Mortal Strike and what-not scale off of your weapon damage still, so a slower high-damage weapon is always preferable, the sword is atrocious really.
---
Layering is continent wide.
---
spirit ofc
---
just ignore + healing stuff until you're around 45
---
I was always ally player. But tried with horde this time around. It makes you change perspective. Where alliance were noble to me before, they’re now just petty pussies lying and being without honour.
---
This is what you're looking for in Neatplates: https://i.vgy.me/BvxInL.jpg
---
Not sure about Details though, I didn't have any issues with it at all.
---
then don't have the Horde cut down trees in ashenvale.
---
in warcraft 3 the return of malufrion leads to peace between the orcs and eleves in part because the burning legion invasion is of higher importance but also because he unlike his hotheaded wife understand that both sides made massive mistakes leading to that tragedy.
---
WoW forces this war to reignite by having Malfurion go back in slumber leave Tyrande in charge and having the orcs restart their woodcutting in Ashenvale.
---
this was resolved by the end of Warcraft 3 but WoW made a pretty forced excuse to reignite that war.
---
you're argueing this in the wrong order. you say they couldn't join because of the tree cutting. i say don't write the tree cutting because you want them to be at war at all.
---
people forget how much of the justification of the status quo in WoW was written in WoW itself or suplemtal material NOT in the previous material.
---
The fact that you care what a random guy does on a stream, LMAO... WHO THE FUCK CARES what he does? It's his life he decide what to do, stop making drama for no fucking reason.

---
Thanks, but I played in vanilla, and my question was specifically asking if I remembered correctly about armor etiquette in vanilla.
---
Could also theme it like Kira does it in Deathnote for the anime guys
---
cuz its potentially the nr1 class in dps and THE tank
---
it scales really well into lategame and its good every phase
---
and raids can stack many of them
---
its just that it sucks to gear up very expensive
---
Wouldn’t you wanna do corruption before imolate?
---
So by your logic which i don't support someone can roll need on everything because he can even sell BoP items. Fush your item upgrade BoP i can sell that blue sword for 50s at the next seller. 
---
Still don't start making new things up just to make your arguements valid because it was clear that the group didn't agree to roll need on that.

I really like owls to level, they have dive for more movement speed and screech. Screech is a aoe with low dmg but reduces the ap from enemys and with the ae aggro you can multishot without you pet loosing aggro.

Oh please, I don't even have retail installed :D
---
I can explain it to you from my perspecitve as someone who prefers classic over TBC.
---
What I like in TBC:
---
* New talents/skills
---
* Karazhan.
---
What I dislike:
---
* I think outland is ugly. I dislike pretty much every zone besides Nagrand and half of the zones are differently colored deserts.
---
* Flying. I hate it for reasons stated in this sub hundreds of times.
---
* Arenas. Not a fan of the arena system. I played arena because I had to for PvP gear but it was never really fun to mw personally.
---
* Old world is becoming more redundant.
---
* Shattrath sucks and mixed faction capitals are lame.
---
* I raided up until Hyjal in TBC and while the fights were all I really didn't like the design of most raids. I prefer the more classic fantasy design of vanilla rather than the more scifi approach of TBC.
---
Well, it IS blizzard's fault in the first place that they obscuring everything with their tech.
---
Why? The average player don't even know about layering. But WE, who want every little bit of information do! If this shit works as if the blue said, why can I log in and switch layers and FEEL the negative consequences? Why can't Blizz just fire up 200 Elwynn Forest "instances" so high level zones don't have really few players scattered BECAUSE layering?
---
and don't bother with this -shockingly- awful layering tech?
---
Probably single target, how much faster would aoe be for lvling? Would it still be viable for running dungeons? I do play with a friend some times, he is a rouge, but we have diff schedules so we might not lvl together much
---
no kink shaming!
---
Surely there's far more to "downgrading" the game to classic than replacing data. Most mechanics must've been hardcoded so they would still need original code (or a remake of it) to run classic.
---
Lay it out for the person you were arguing with so they can answer.

Looks like a huge demand for shamans but this lacks a lot of horde data
---
Talent make people think. People hate think. Think hurt. Me want make dps. How dps with no think? No talent!
---
Is he flagged for PVP?
---
Bullshit. It was a real question.
---
it was to complicated for the common people, so they dumed it down.
---
thats why they also implemented dual spec later on, so it getts easier by not sticking to one specc
---
Think its cause the shaman or you is toggled as pvp and the other isnt and for some reason windfury doesn't work
---
Blizzard claimed that everyone just did the same talents in the end. Cookie cutter builds were common, but even some had different choices and all that.
---
Instead of making viable alternate talents, Blizzard decided to remove them as they were. 
---
Sure they thought that talents were too tedious to click every level. I wholeheartedly agree that talents make me look forward to leveling. Nowadays, you can go 20 levels on a class without anything to show for it except some more base HP.
---
You don't really get much of a choice in Classic anyway. Very rarely do you have to make a distinction between two identical ilevels. You get what you're given.
---
get the census classic addon
---
I went addon free until level 20 to get my taste of vanilla. But after Barrens I went to addons. I don't use a map addon, but I do reference wow Atlas in a browser from time to time like this haha.
---
This was on my work computer in free time so it was addon free. Half assed wondered around for like 20 min while working before hitting the lake there to unlock the map haha.
---
There is no wind shear in classic
---
I'm at about the same mark and I only did each dungeon once. It's not very efficient unless you run multiple mages and do crazy pulls.
---
Ah it warms the old heart to read posts like this :p
---
What’s next? South shore/Tarren Mill and Crossroads PvP raids! That’s what!
---
If I need the item I roll for it,  doesn't matter when I'm going to wear it. Sorry.

Everyone can do the same tho but damn those hunters anyway.

Going in was the weirdest thing. People inside were all running in place or just standing still. Then I got teleported to outside the entrance, and all the NPC's in Tirisfal were gone. Got dc'd, logged back in and it was all good though.

standard blizz ui + dominos
---
They should just get rid of the concept of leveling once and for all. It's a vestige of the old pen and paper days when dudes needed a simple way to show character growth.
---
We need an EVE-style progression where your skills simply develop over time and you can do whatever you want meanwhile. That way, all the game is endgame.

Stealth ranks just make you move faster in stealth, iirc

You really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies?

I think it is against the ToS to change any character models, so no I don't think you can. Druid of Azeroth was awesome back in classic.

&gt; Unrelated to macros, I don't see why you'd want to open with CoA.

You are debuffed (50% miss chance). So you are kind of exaggerating here

I don't have an answer as to why it was removed except the speculation that it was probably for balancing one thing or another.

I came here to say that I'm SO excited to have the old talent trees back! The possibilities are so open and exciting. I hated being locked into one talent tree. Speccing a little into other trees to compliment your playstyle really brings another level of personality to the game!

The posture check is basically a meme as much as it is a well intentioned reminder. It's supposed to sound condescending.

I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but the Punisher IS a bad guy.

Some talents are so badly designed that they're are actually never picked by anyone ever!

Tauren have a larger hitbox in classic. This allows them to hit enemies, that are further away. But they can also be hit from further away. To be precise, male Tauren have 5.5yards. Female Tauren have 5.2yards. Everybody else has 3yards. You can read more on the pros and cons here:

What? All this is is a macro that executed a sequence of spells that he usually uses on any random mob, nothing is stopping him from casting things manually if the situation asks for it.
---
Even undead hunter would still be lame they would look cool, IMO. Locks at least have some style about them.
---
I'm a tank, and I don't care.  I pass on most loot anyway.  It makes people think I'm a nice person, and on my level 16 tank, I have 90 silver currently, so I'm not exactly poor.  I also had an alt tank in TBC, which I took above 60.
---
I level exclusively in instances.  That means I'm probably going to run every instance a minimum of six times, which more or less guarantees that if there is anything in there that I want, I will get it eventually.  If you're a good tank, which I like to think I am, then people enjoy helping you in my experience.
---
Although, you should also know, that if you are pure dps, (neither tank or healer) then you are playing an exclusively self-serving role, and you can expect to be at the bottom of the social pile accordingly.  This is why I stopped playing a Hunter, because I was tired of playing a selfish class, and receiving the lack of respect that accordingly went with it.
---
***No pure DPS class has the right to expect being a higher priority for gear than a tank or healer.*** Full stop.
---
You are there for your own glory; to top the DPS meter.  This isn't so much the case with shamans due to them being hybrids, but Rogues and Hunters in particular don't do anything which directly benefits anyone else.  In addition to that, Hunters frequently cause wipes with their pets, and they also stress both tanks and healers by frequently rushing and pulling mobs before the rest of the group are ready.  I've tanked for some decent Hunters before, but if I have the choice of being in a group with the best Hunter in the world, or a group with no Hunters, I'm choosing the latter in a heartbeat.  I don't even need to think about it.  Ditto for Rogues.
---
Because you have a res, if a DPS shaman has an entitlement complex about gear, then it will be tolerated if and only if neither a tank or healer wants said item.  If a tank or healer does want said item, then they get it, and if the shaman either ninjas it or has a tantrum over it, they are very likely to get kicked.
---
Bye then.

Bruh for real

I guess we are talking about right at the end of vanilla.

So glad you blocked out the names of people in your party, you don't know what I would have done with that information.

I like his post [here](https://snew.notabug.io/r/classicwow/comments/cwwd2r/players_on_the_second_floor_of_the_auberdine_inn/eyfw3vm/) where he directs someone complaining about antiafk to "report them". I guess someone took his advice when they saw him doing it.

---
Ya I prob won’t aoe then, I been googling and I also play on a pvp server and i started a week late so there’s prob way too much competition at this point
---
Same, I just figured that whoever did the explaining didn't know what they were talking about. There's gotta be a way of knowing which layer you're in (especially once we have more people chilling in the capital city) but /who is definitely not it.
---
Wow I used to watch this guy play osrs years ago... small world

in Classic WoW? Because as far as I can tell, Details! Classic-version does not have a threat-plugin.

I see, not sure what I was thinking. It’s my main 300 skinning 300 mining 45 hunter (2 bars from 46)
---
Legit have spent an hour on a simple gathering quest at level 14. I love it.
---
Holy cow, they did? I didn't know that.
---
Thanks, I knew about nocombat but not nostance. Macros are understandably pretty limited when it comes to if logic as otherwise you could just write code to be able to mash one button all the time. But this definitely gives me some more stance dancing options. Thanks!
---
It does. Anger Management is too good, as is Sweeping Strikes and eventually, Mortal Strike.
---
I think it's a case of 'pick your favorite'. Unless you wany to min/max the levelling process.
---
I die before i have enough rage to hamstring :/ .#early leveling
---
I’ve been absolutely loving the grind that this game is and this is definitely my best “accomplishment” so far in the game and I’m stoked about it. Took a ton of tedious mob grinding, but totally worth it!
---
yes I think blizz are starting to reduce the number of layers
---
guess you didn't read the part about ClassicThreatMeter needing everyone in the party/raid to have the addon in order for them to show up.
---
as someone else said, try Details.

Did you pay attention to the lowest possible value of 0.64?

---
Yes Theres literally nobody ever I hate blizzard for this it ruined the launch for me
---
I mean yes, but also no.  I only got the skills I needed, but because those are both DPS and healing it might be more than others.
---
Honestly water was my biggest expense, about 2 gold an hour in water (my mage friend just got the good water so this is less of a problem now).
---
Just play what you enjoy and don’t worry about damage output, all classes have ups and downs at some point so it’s more about enjoying the time you put in. But that’s just my opinion!
---
Concidered using threatplates, but I'm almost certain ElvUI will come with some nameplate improvement that has same / almost same functionality. Just waiting for it to happen.
---
Some popular zones are still quite active. You're not meant to have a dozen people on your screen at all times, that's not classic experience at all (and in contested zones that would just make questing impossible).
---
Lmao haha exx deee
---
Dear diary,
---
No. Blizzard never let's people migrate **from** low pop realms but they have opened up wide free migration from high pop servers to low pop in the past for retail realms.
---
Except Blizzard is Activision now. No difference anymore. Look at the evolution of the leads on every project since the merging.
---
shimmering is dangerous if ally tho
---
&gt; As a warrior at that point, you're so close to getting into plate that I don't see it being that big of a deal. Gear that can carry a shaman for 10 levels, versus gear that a warrior will wear until they get a green plate "of the bear" drop...
---
Not realistic. Yes, you're very close to unlocking plate at that point, but SM gear is extremely strong, easy to get, and worth more than most greens until your mid-50s. If you're looking for plate upgrades to those items...
---
* Raging Berserker's Helm is the most easily replaced piece, as you can run RFD for Icemetal Barbute (better for tanking, slightly worse for DPS), and many Warriors will prioritize the dungeon as it has the only viable chest drop until BRD.
---
* Herod's Shoulder will last until Big Bad Pauldrons in Zul'Farrak ~10 levels later (which for reference is only ~2% more phys DR).
---
* Gauntlets of Divinity may also be replaced by Vice Grips in Zul'Farrak, though they need to roll well.
---
* Scarlet Leggings are very hard to replace; you'll basically use them until Princess in Maraudon or BRD/LBRS.
---
* Although you may use other weapons for single target/questing, Ravager is a near unbeatable multitarget (dungeon) weapon until around Gatorbite Axe from Maraudon or equivalent.
---
While plate does have increased armor, upgrades aren't very common; while the extra armor value has some value, it's not as big of a concern as other bonuses. Most Warriors will continue to wear mostly mail until at least 50, and many continue to wear several pieces right up to (and even after) 60. Post-60, you should expect to see DPS (and even some tank) Warriors frequently wearing a mix of leather, mail, and plate, depending on the phase.
---
Play warlock then
---
Yes like Hutbear said, I had the same encounter. There was another Nelf at the time I tamed Humar, but he was afk while he spawned and I wasn't. 
---
I would just park your character in the tree and log in and out from time to time to see if he's there. I was 'lucky' because I got informed by someone else he caught Humar at around 01:00am. His respawntimer is something like 8-12 hours, so I was actively waiting for him at around 09:00. At around 10:15 he spawned for me.
---
God I wish were on the team of devs that built this game. I bet it was just such a fucking blast.
---
If I were coding shit like this I would be the happiest person in the world.
---
can someone explain to me why people are willing to pay for shit like this?xD
---
The worse sin is that they put eastern kingdoms on the left. Why?!
---
Well yea that's what happens when you try to change layers in a small community, you just end up on the same one eventually.
---
Ironically, I ended up questing instead.
---
Later they added a Horde vendor for the chicken feed.
---
How about instead of worrying about “viability” and letting other people tell you what to play, you pick whichever you like most, and play that?
---
Yes, I spent a lot of time before release to decide classes, and I ended up picking rogue slightly over priest. On top of that I was a mage main in vanilla and up to legion. So, every time I see a priest or a mage questing besides me I'm rethinking my pick.  
---
The fix to that is reminding myself of is when the urges come is that I did this mistake in vanilla originally. I re-rolled toons for almost a year, and actually never hit 60 on any of them. So, I basically missed out on the post 60 stuff because of this issue. In your case it could work to just have a rule that you should at least hit 60 on your first toon before leveling an alt!
---
Grats dude ^im not jealous at all
---
Nope, nixxiom Is on EU
---
Hey man you gotta do you! Saying that stuff isn’t viable in a world like classic is folley. Take a breather lvl 60 is a long grind and all the raids you wanna do after that as well. It’s a marathon not a race and you sound like you’re burning out
---
solo? I considering pickpocket runs but apparently pp loot is very weak now
---
Fuckin same.
---
The battle Rez (rebirth) is the only one with a 30 min CD.
---
Revive has no CD but can not be cast while in combat
---
No mankrik's wife joke?
---
Want to do this but also don't want my switch banned.
---
Just play what you enjoy! If we all play the class and spec that is best of paper, the game would be boring as fuck
---
Blizzard have the power to change all that without us knowing. They haven't told us any specifics to prevent exploitation.
---
Because then at 60 once AQ comes out and everyone else has their shiny AQ gear I'll just be tossed around in pvp...?
---
I disagree with your sentiment. They are wildly different games, and people enjoy different things. Does classic have more QoL challenges? Yes. Is it the better game? Well, that depends on who you ask. And I don't like your approach to sub count clearly supporting tbc being the superior game, as there are a lot of other factors playing in here. In example TBC is a more casual over all play experience and therefore appeals to more people. And there could be dozens more reasons why the sub count was higher without it being the superior game.
---
on a big realm there should be a market for AH 
---
in any case u can check for disenchant values
---
at least the weapons with good sstats could be sellable even randomly telling in the chats
---
Comgrats! Did you do much auction house/selling or did you just have enough from leveling? I'm at 32 with 17g wondering how far away I'll be from affording one.
---
Or healers trying to solo was painful?
---
Also for people who are used to druids in retail where casting a spell gets you out of your form automatically, /cancelform exists in classic so you don't have to exit bear/cat manually before casting something.
---
Example:  
---
\#showtooltip Moonfire(Rank 1)  
---
/cancelform  
---
/cast Moonfire(Rank 1)
---
True, even the folder structure uses _retail_ and _classic_ respectively to differentiate the two.
---
What does VC stand for?
---
same!
---
As an Rs3 and OSRS player. Enjoy both, understand the community will divide heavily over time yet will unite over some weird bullshit.
---
I mean.... I hadn't seen it yet.
---
Yea, especially the part with the CC got me confused. I heard it before, that back in the days, you'd really need these abilities what left me confused when we ran our first dungeons, I sapped and marked everything but we quickly realized that this really wasn't needed. That was the first time we thought, well, something must be significantly different to what every one played back then!
---
Win win, more time to play wow.
---
and thats the important thing. Everyone have the chance to build the classic feeling on hes own.
---
If you help someone, maybe he think about the same and help some other one. This is circle and a movement everyone can do something for the better future.
---
Basically this. 
---
As someone who has a job and doesn't want to babysit my character while going AFK every night, it's well worth the 25$ or whatever to transfer back in the future if need be.
---
Tanks don't need to do any DPS. That's why you have the other three people in your group. Your job is to stand there and soak up all that damage. Use a shield.
---
&gt; I don't understand how it'd be greedy on the sham's part when the warriors start using plate at 40 anyway? Chances are SM gear is gonna be used from 40 on your sham until almost 50, whereas the warrior is gonna find some big dick plate at 40 and throw away all of his mail.
---
Not realistic. Yes, you may be close to unlocking plate at that point, but SM drops are *very* good, easy to get, and worth more than most greens until your mid-50s. If you're looking for plate upgrades to those items...
---
* And although you will probably use other weapons for single target/questing, Ravager is a near unbeatable multitarget (dungeon) weapon until around Gatorbite Axe from Maraudon or equivalent.
---
While plate does have increased armor, upgrades aren't very common, and though the extra armor value has some value, it's not as big of a concern as statistical bonuses. Most Warriors will continue to wear mostly mail until at least 50, and many continue to wear several pieces right up to (and even after) 60. Post-60, you should expect to see DPS (and even some tank) Warriors frequently wearing a mix of leather, mail, and plate, depending on the phase.

---
ftfy and yes i would found it cool if people wouldn't ask for it or even wisper me with that because i will not help them saves both people time
---
Other then that it would be cool if people would use the chats for what they are for. Trading for trading lfg for lfg ... mostly its agreed on spamming trade for lfg ATM but once trading chats get bigger i guess there will be a problem with that.
---
&gt; the only real viable one
---
You shouldn't be so stuck on this kind of mentality. Hunters are fine  and do really good for majority of classic. You shouldn't think how viable it is in Naxx which isn't going to be out in ages.
---
WoW Classic is an official Blizzard release.
---
They actually adapted one of their later patch versions to make it look and act like vanilla wow.
---
This means that you're not playing the same engine version or client as you used to, but the new and improved one. (No walljumping, several disconect bugs fixed, battle.net integration, etc..)
---
They recreated the entire game with some QoL changes (opening all mail button, 1000 guild member slots vs vanilla's 200, etc).
---
I haven't encountered any faults so far, and it's really fun to know that my characters will be there 'forever'.
---
It won't cost you any more than a subscription, you don't need to buy base WoW or BFA.
---
Ahhh I still can't decide what I want to have at 60. 
---
I'm currently rocking ghost saber but the lions are cool as well. Brokentooth has a actual advantage but looks kind of meh. Idk anymore.
---
I would love to level with someone! Unfortunately none of my friends play wow and my guild are all much higher than I am. I guess getting to 60 solo as a warrior will be quite an accomplishment then :)
---
Can’t SM grind unless you’re a shaman, warrior or mage as dps. Feels bad, no one will take me as a hunter
---

---
!remindme 6 hours
---
The exact same reason people are willing to pay for xmog stuff in retail. RPG's are as much about gaining power as they are about fashioning your character to your tastes.
---
It's a bunch of strawmen. He's picking apart the concerns he can while ignoring the valid ones.
---
Quod erat demonstrandum.
---
Is zygor guides worth it for the I game add on? (Alliance)
---
Yeah, they need work. I’ve never had good finger dexterity, and honestly I’ve had my foot on the gas the entire time I’ve been online, and now that I have my mount I’m gonna take some time and reconfigure everything.
---
Do hunters fall of as hard in PvP as they do in PvE around that same time?
---
Rogues must save a fortune when it comes to buying abilities.
---
Yes, they are non combat pets.  You can buy one, right click the item, and you get a kitty to follow you around.  Enjoy :)
---
Yeah I know, but most of these thing kind of fall apart when you’re either fighting mobs much higher level than you, the place is swarmed with mobs you can’t afford to pull, or you simply can’t be bothered to play so proactively.
---
No. Guild chat is constantly filled with "hey can I get a layer invite?" 
---
They wouldn't be doing it if it didn't help.
---
I never got how weapon less enemies can parry. They parry with their arms? That's gotta hurt
---
No one levels as tank or healer. Ok, 99.9% don't, just to cover. So your tank and your healer, which you REQUIRE for that group, are doing you a favor. They don't need you, you need them. DPS are immediately replaceable, just the way it is. This changes eventually, but most people aren't there yet and wouldn't make stupid ass comments if they were.
---
I know right, I bet he reads every "Terms and Conditions" he accepts. what a loser.
---
nothing was bad about it... I'm loving it. 1% chance to hit when dual wielding is such a huge power upgrade every level, plus you're free to "personalize" your build a bit and make various hybrids.... it's vastly superior to the "redesigned" talents, which was one of the "smart" design decisions that ended up destroying class diversity and ruining retail...
---
There are plenty of resources for this but if you just want the same as OPs macro but a warrior version of it, just apply the same logic but with the warrior skills with the desired order.
---
Kinda explains the 3 hour run though :D
---
Exactly this. It is a challenge. I've played WoW for 10 years now and I wanted to experiance a new challenge. Like leveling a full group to 60 and equip them all with Pre Raid BiS for each phase.
---
While I level i monitored the WoW Classic Forum in http://dual-boxing.com and saw so many people who sometimes prepared weeks before launch quitting multiboxing within the first week because it is so hard to level and takes so much more time.
---
You cant really do questlines / follow guides as you have to do every collection quest 5 times, no matter the dropchance. I've killed 250 Murlocs for one collection quest.
---
Dungeon Grinding does only work for skilled players with a dungeon setup. I personally roll a Warrior, 3 Mages and a Priest. Which I assumed would work just fine weeks ago. It does indeed work pretty well as I've managed to finish every dungeon till lvl 31 so far. Just started SM GY yesterday. A lot of people like this Gnome play 5 times the same class, which makes it incredibly harder to finish lvl 60 dungeons later.
---
It is a challenge and I like it so far.
---
This is actually amazing
---
Last update added it , you have to go in settings create new window and pick threat plugin, it’s awesome
---
No jokes about that guys dead wife pls ^^/s
---
Ah, those are different circumstances, obviously.
---
Thanks...sentiment still the same.
---
I don't.  But I've been one the recieving end in BC arena days.  I can see why some are attracted.  For me it's too much both in money's and efforts tbh
---
Sup dude what level are you now?
---
I aspire to be this level of petty.
---
I may not have been 100% clear. What I was trying to say was that I don’t want to end up on a server where most of the community is typing in another language in General Chat or what have you. Nothing wrong with a little multiculturalism, I agree. (I also don’t claim that there are realms where it is like that. I was just wondering if there were servers like that and if so which ones)
---
Hunters always wreck in pvp, don’t worry about it.
---
Definitely. There were a ton of abilities I didn’t train, but none that were crucial imo. Couldn’t imagine being a warrior trying to DPS/tank like my buddy is. So many necessary abilities!
---
Directly or indirectly. More layers means higher playercap. Along the AFK changes they've made it would reduce queue time dramatically with additional layers.
---
Thank you :)
---
I got distracted by the fact that this is an US census, thought that people who'd join gravediggers would go on the EU realm instead of the US one.
---
There's a lot of ally horde competition on ZT EU, mainly between the big guilds like Gravediggers and Muscle Club, I also think ally has majority.
---
There isn’t really anything after AQ and Naxx so don’t really even worry about that at all. Not that you should worry about it in general. You’ll always have a place in a group no matter what class you are. Plus since hunters have a pet you never have to feel alone while roaming the world!
---
This genuinely makes me want to make a warrior
---
The talent trees are wrong. Why would you get deep wounds as Arms or Fury since the talents are % dmg based? That makes no sense.
---
That be paying 100 Gold every single time you go raiding
---
Source?
---
Can someone explain to me what layers do on WoW realms? Im so confused
---
We are reaching cringe levels that shouldn’t be possible.  
---
But seriously have you ever heard of layering?
---
Tailoring has no bonus to cloth drop rates in classic. Just Farm runecloth by killing lvl 50+ humanoids
---
Stupid sexy priest
---
Unfortunately that isn't the one.
---
Cant even stand behind your words, learn to not make assumptions. Making assumptions is a sign of stupidity, but keep it up
---
they posted some info during the final stress test about how they fixed some dynamic respeawn code that was source code but bugged. so it sounds like the dynamic respawns werent working correctly during a large portion of vanilla but are now as intended.
---
personnaly think its not a bad move on blizzards end but it has been a royal pain in my ass not being prepared for 3-4 mobs to spawn consecutevely immediatly after killing them, especially in a contested zone where going oom even if killing the mob(s) in question means certain death.
---
1. If Apes showed anything, you don't need amazing gear to still play PvE. I understand AQ and Nax are harder. However, don't kid yourself that it would be impossible. On that note, the odds on you personally getting to Nax is slim to none if you are already having issues. Too many people talk as if they will actually be in guilds doing them casually. 
---
2. If you had full MC or ZG gear, you will do perfectly fine in PvP.  If you think hunters will not chunk mages in Nax gear, you are wrong.
---
3. As other posted, play what you enjoy. I will earn though, you are in the very early stages of leveling for all your toons. You will have to put in a considerable amount of time to get 60 on any of them.
---
It is EU, not sure why it says US
---
Something wrong with your comp then, because I can easily pull 200 FPS on 5 settings with a very much worse rig than that.
---
There's millions of people everywhere (and my server doesn't even have queues). The more popular questing spots are so overcrowded it's a problem to tag a single mob. So no, it doesn't.
---
Thing is the realm pops now are several times higher than vanilla - now imagine 5x the people fighting for the same respawns that use timers from vanilla, intended for 5x less people...
---
They do go to EU, just didn't realise there was a US ZT
---
Just think if you were on an ironman challenge and have to delete your toon.
---
Enchanters cowl
---
Early green headpiece
---
I have cleared naxx on pserver and we had 3 hunters on KT kills.
---
They're useful for pulls and literally essential on gluth.
---
They're always top tier in PvP as you will explode clothies.
---
Do not worry at all.
---
Thank you guys!
---
Holy shit who cares? Do you feel the need to defend them? I couldnt care less about them, but holy shit you are cringy with this fanboyism.
---
This is the real answer.  It's not "roll only for the spec/role you're in this dungeon as or fuck you", and it's also not "roll for every spec could possibly have".  As usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.
---
Indeed. This is called an eggcorn, in case you didn't know.
---
It's so funny we have classic WoW in the post-meme epoch. Hilarious combination.
---
My bad on level to cap proff .  The disenchanting stands tho so it's more useful a prof for a bank alt than most other proffs
---
Especially lol. You'll 2 shot anything in cloth at that point.
---
This guy nerds
---
I have no idea about that, as I didn't play vanilla, but I think that classic is supposed to be referenced from 1.12 patch
---
Play whatever you want, you wont hit 60 for months so don't worry
---
yesterday no queue at 4 pm CET, 600 queue at 5 pm CET... it's really ok now
---
Get a life buddy.
---
It doesn't *mean* higher playercap, it just removes the gameplay implications of having too many people online at once. At some point you still run into hardware limitations because layers don't magically make servers run faster or have higher bandwidth.
---
Where can you get it for oculus?  I’m very interested in checking this out.
---
Quit horsin around guys, the Barrens is serious business.
---
Not all .exe programs are blocked - most that try to make changes are. You never know, unless you've tried!
---
I'm a priest, literally everyone but warrior and rogues is rolling for my gear.
---
Thank you both of you guys! I'll keep my enchanting then
---
Get a warrior duo to run dungeons with. 2 Warriors DPSing and both offtanking works better than having 1 tank and essentially opens up a DPS slot for your group. 4 DPS and 1 Healer is easily the fastest way of going through dungeons and it's also easier on your healer himself
---
You'll have your barb of the sand reaver and be critting 3.5k aimed shots 2k multishots on people with 4k hp.
---
I had to agree with him. I used to know people in wow, regular encounters. Now it seems like you only meet new people every day, and the auction house is flooded. I haven't intentionally layer hopped yet, and am disgusted by knowing I will have to in the future

You know that we’re are around 6-12 months away from AQ release right??

Seriously tho gratz on mount!

I have been altoholic and twinkoholic for my whole wow career (since tbc) but now im trying to focus just one character and im atm lvl 35 rogue and so far it feels good :p

That's not what doxxing is. These are video game character names.

Also make sure you don’t use sharpening stones - they will prevent you from getting the buff.  It seems like you aren’t but I thought I’d mention that.

What do bats eat usually? I might plan to tame one later on but i have no idea what they eat and can't look when at work. Thank you!

Atleast you didnt name it Coco
---
Good news goblin engineering is a thing again
---
Its fine if you just throw corruption and CoA but I quickly out threat the VW if I just add a wand into the mix and even faster if I go full rotation. It'll hold threat for as many as 1-2 seconds, seconds I could use to just dps the mob dead instead with imp or succubus. The VW is a good situational pet tho, good for escort quests and psuedo bubble gank protection.
---
ironic,coming from the multi layer cynic who wanted to shit on someone for a rare pet but is now like 'lol chill out guys you owned me'
---
Ironic that a druid kicked a warlock from the group for a more meta class.
---
Well then you shouldn't have any real issues with hunters if you don't care that much about PvE meter topping. They're well off in PvP.
---
I downrank it when I'm on as a healer, which is most of the time. But when I'm along as DPS, that's a 6-second shock cooldown... I felt I might not be contributing in my role if I was constantly spending the cooldown on a rank 1 spell D:
---
Wait, when did they add the ability to reroll the demon names? I thought it was in vanilla..? Is that still in classic?
---
Sounds like driver issues or if you're extremely unlucky hardware issues.
---
Try uninstalling drivers with DDU in safe mode and then installing them again?
---
survival/marksman hunters wreck PvP, can't kill what you can't get near.
---
Back in the day?
---
But my arcane shot uses spell power!
---
You're lucky to get that much with that many missing flight points.
---
Not at any kind of attainable ratio you monkey. You need a massive amount of agi to make up for 1 point of strength. 
---
1 str is 2 AP 
---
~20 agi is 1% crit. 
---
Wind fury gives 20% more AP so that’s just another benefit of str. 
---
If you stack agi as enhance you are straight up autistic. Now, sacrificing a small amount of str may be worth it for a massive amount of agi but those gear options don’t really exist in classic.
---
Free character mogration from full servers. They will. Be unlocked to others in a couple days
---
That's a big part of immersion, you look like shit, you're oom every 2 mobs and you die if you body pull 2-3 mobs.
---
I wouldn't join a guild without having conversation with some kind of officer I would  want to know what kind of community It is from texting you can't figure of anything.
---
The talent trees also have some issues with power creep when you keep adding levels.
---
Once they added TBC, they had to make the new capstone talents good enough to be able to compete with the combinations you could get from 10 extra points in the original tree.
---
With each expansion, it became more difficult to add new talents.
---
If you look at the Classic talent trees, you can see that they are well crafted to allow diversity, and disallow certain combinations.
---
Luckily back in the day I was a Huntard so I didn't give a flying fook about raid frames 😂
---
ugly square faced nerd goblin
---
Use layers
---
God i hate the void walker, it's so fucking bad at tanking.
---
I decided i would make for a better tank, so i switched drain tanking.
---
Rogues rolling on healing leather though...
---
Ah, warriors complaining that they have it bad in classic. Yes, yes...
---
I just want arena 😭
---
how do you know these nunbers?
---
I'll just heal all the mobs to death outside
---
If you've read John Staats book or heard him discuss it in various places, they actually had more content for Vanilla WoW than they could support (Karazhan for example was initially supposed to be in vanilla), it just wasn't possible to scale that high.
---
The problem they were having was that Naxx was already stretching the limits of how high stats should go, that tanks were getting too good at avoidance, that healers were never running out of mana, that certain classes were just taking off because of scaling with their talents.
---
You can't just keep adding more stats to items to balance the game, there are more factors than that. TBC also came up against this limit where they had to put a debuff in sunwell to make tanks have worse avoidance because they couldn't balance fights around it afterwards.
---
The idea of even a Tier 4 in classic is ridiculous. It wouldn't work without changing some fundamental game mechanics. There's a good reason why every expansion has to jack up the numbers by some significant amount, tweak the talents and change the way itemisation works. It's not just because they think people like big numbers.
---
Peggle
---
They leave it the fuck alone or do fresh launch servers like Daybreak did for EverQuest
---
Ive seen most guides suggest spellpower &gt; intellect/stamina&gt;spirit.
---
But what is the rates? 
---
How much intellect would an item have to be better than 10 sp as an example?
---
Yeah i killed a LOT of horde with friends. A fkin lot. But no ganking and no greys.
---
Like every taxi driver ever when you're new to the area
---
Exploit early, Exploit often.
---
You can also make it hide untill mouse-over.
---
Well, a warrior needs their stance. And that quest has to be done in a contested zone for alliance.
---
He couldn't do the quest, even off-stream people were ganking him while others were defending him.
---
I still remember the couple of times I got world drop epics in vanilla. Literally feels like winning the lottery. Your brain feels like mush afterwards.
---
Yeah but effectively it doesn't matter if that assumption is right or not, because I get to do whatever it is I was doing.
---
Are you replacing your rank 1 spells on your hotbar with their higher rank versions. It's an easy mistake to make.
---
My eldest is 8, I started a druid with her, she plays and I give advice... I would love to play with her, in game, but double subscritions would be costly.

Another really simple but really useful one is this, it just swaps the ability between Aquatic Form and Travel Form depending on if you are swimming or not.

Your job is basically to control the pulls and keep things hitting you rather than your friends. Grab a shield, and stay in D stance, put sunder armor on everything. Hit revenge when it procs. That's going to set you in good stead going forward.
---
Just be aware, you won't have a lot of rage to play with for a while, so spread the love (sunder) around. Ignore dps. In fact if you have recount you might as well close it down, it's just gonna distract you from tanking. Have fun, tanking is the most engaging and rewarding role in the game imo!
---
I did a search on the wow classic bug report forum for “unable to start 3d acceleration” like OP said and discord seemed to be the problem for them too.
---
Excellent way to weed out stupid people though.
---
ive been doing duengons but havent been making money so im just gonna do a lot of quests til 40 for my mount. but its hard since whenever i see horde its a 50% chance theyll jump me and for some reason they always have backup
---
Level 40 On horde rn. 
---
If played well you will be outdamaging almost everybody in any AoE past level 30. Easily the best Melee in the game for leveling through dungeons.
---
You're weak before 20, but your damage becomes on-par with the others at 20 with cleave, then gets a massive boost at 30 with sweeping strikes and then AGAIN gets an even larger boost at 36 with whirlwind and with ravager. 
---
Speedrunning dungeons with 4 DPS/1Heal right now. I have 2 warriors, Fill everything else. The two warriors are tanky enough by default to tank purely with 2H, and their extreme burst lets you mantain AoE threat better than prot.
---
Also healers have never been upset by it, because you actually end up taking way less damage using this method than just one tank Sword/Shield.
---
6660 for 60 nice

&gt;What is endgame for you?Druids are insane dungeon tanks, but are off tanks only usually in raids. (If anything)They can tank most raid encounters (but some encounters not), and there are some top players who main tank as a druid, but they are on the whole definitely worse than warriors, mostly due to crushing blows and you'll have a hell of a time finding a guild that'll let you do it.
---
I've maintanked TBC progression on a Paladin from day one, and never had a problem - it's downright \*way\* more efficient than a warrior for a lot of bosses (Illidan or Vashj come to mind) - all fast bosses are easier on a Paladin due to CBs never being an issue. Druids also did really well in TBC.
---
Classic though... yeah, go with a warrior. They're just better.
---
Leveling warrior/resto sham. We usually tank 2h other than massive pulls. Although even then if warrior cleaving it's back to 2h
---
You get freaking jailed if you hack in Korea iirc. It's just China with their shitty double standards.
---
Oh interesting. But how would I get pixel perfect then on 1440p
---
Arms is objectively better now that you can't abuse /sit. Liking fury more is fine, but saying it's stronger, or that arms is harder early, is just wrong. If someone is having trouble as arms, it isn't just because they aren't fury.
---
Still, I personally enjoy boosts for twinks.
---
See rule 3
---
I would recommend macroing the claw ability as it had bo cooldown such as bite, this means that your pet is going to spam claw until its focus is depleted. But if you make a macro for claw you can use it on demand when you see your pet has extra focus. The macro is super easy and can just be something like /cast Claw(rank 5).
---
S.Korea. Japan has harsh punishment on cheating too, so yeah.
---
It'a just China.
---
I’m a shaman and I’ve pissed off so many mages and warlocks needing cloth gear. They just don’t understand that leather gear (I’m under 40 still sadly) and even mail gear doesn’t optimize for caster stats

You just have to download the SteamVR client and go through there. It allows you with the Oculus. GL!
---
How is it different? You're still doing PvE content with set rules and other random people which are expecting to be respected equally as much. Learning to be a better PvEr in dungeons is how you get invited and prosper into Raid content. I guess I'm just too ideal when it comes to things like these but I've always pertained to these rules and most other people I've played with have also agreed with them.
---
Japan is probably more strict just talking in general sense of culture. They follow the rules and do not deviate off from the norm. That's the culture right there.
---
SK can be more forfiving most of the time, but they will fine you. I have never heard of anyone doing jail time because he sold gold in MMORPG. But if you hacked a server or did some very shady shit, yes, you may end up in jail.
---
What is it ?
---
It was going to end badly for you anyway xD
---
I actually think this is aninteresting topic as a druid. If I'm invited as a healer, I would expect to be allowed to roll on caster gear. However, as I'm a leveling druid, and thus playing feral, I would also roll on leather gear with agi / strength - as we're all doing dungeons for the purpose of leveling. That does feel kinda greedy though - I guess druids are the new hunters. 
---
But to answer your question, a druid playing as a caster, should roll on cloth gear, as there is fairly limited amounts of leather gear with caster stats.
---
Hey, Maevyn and Daddychrist just helped me with a quest in Redridge out of the goodness of their hearts, cheers!

Unless you level your prof alongside your levels then it's

---
That's kinda where I'm coming from. A guild is an important decision. I make it my home, and the members are my family. 
---
I figured it was just me being older and picky. I also kind of figure that in a month or so a lot of people will quit the game, and I don't want to really fuck around with that whole process of like joining, then it dies, then i have to look again, so I was just waiting to join one until things die down a little bit. 
---
Every. single. time. I go to a city though, I get multiple invites to some bullshit guild nobody even talked to me about. It's been bothering me enough that I made this thread to see if I was the weirdo or not.
---
With the major downside of not gaining fun talent points to spend every level.
---
You put bite on auto and manually Claw to focus dump
---
Ofcourse it was.
---
Same here, and if it weren't for layering, I'd hear even more cries from my higher level friends on discord about them getting ganked by large groups of horde, and whining about why we decided to roll on a PvP server.
---
I’ve closed discord down completely and made one slight change in the GeForce control panel. Looks like you could well be right. Thank you
---
view &gt; always on top

How do you switch layer? Every time I ask for an invite my layer doesn’t change

---
Our guild killed Ony with 29 people back in 2005... it’s not the patch that makes it easy. 
---
We also killed it once with a shadow priest tanking for shits and giggles.
---
Deep wounds is % based dmg so if you are leveling and hitting with like 200 you get +20 dmg as dot over 12 seconds... Doesn't seem nice.
---
I assume it’s so Stitches doesn’t murder the flight master every ten minutes
---
It takes twice as long to swim than run. And it is a longer route than running the straight path it is not 10 mins
---
The economy of a server doesn't get fucked in a week. There's thousands of people in every server, and despite what the internet wants you to think, no they don't all farm MC already, most of them are like lvl 20 and fucking around spending unnecessary gold on respeccing 5 times.
---
In that case you shouldn't worry about the absolute top end of endgame. Non of the classes are unplayable, but some might be weaker and stronger than others in some aspects.
---
If anyone is that much of a petulant child that someone calling them out on something like not being meta really upsets them then holy shit the world is over for them.
---
Yeah, there's no possibility to get away with that. They would trivially just write a script to parse all their logs that goes "names of everyone with &gt;10 &lt;whatever that item was&gt;, how many times have they been invited to a group, swapped layers, and acquired one of these items and what is the average time frame of this occurring"
---
Alright, chris? can you review the logs for those names and perma ban the ones obviously exploiting. Thanks.
---
One of us now. By the light, be purged!
---
This just isn't true. Carrot from One Piece is way hotter
---
In essence, seasons. 
---
Continue on to TBC. 
---
You get a choice to copy your toon to a TBC server. Note : COPY. Not move.  At the same time new vanilla servers open.
---
And once TBC is Done. 
---
F R E S H servers. 
---
Some that are only Classic. 
---
Others that start Classic and move to tbc. Following a time line.  Perhaps 1,5 year per expansion
---
So they would all folllow the standard progression, just that the TBC servers move into tbc eventually. 
---
Personally dont care much for WOTLK and forward. 
---
In essence 3 year seasons for TBC, and 1,5 - 2 year seasons for vanilla before FRESH. 
---
Ofcourse your character wouldnt dissapear. 
---
This being Said. I have NO CLUE how this would work on the hardware side. There would be an immanse amount of servers eventually.
---
Sorry for format, im on mobile.
---
Which UI is he using?
---
OP i know you can get charceter models, like being an undead out of form etc. Go watch stromx videos
---
Paladins are terrible DPS for all of Classic, flat out. Warrior is somewhat slow early, but does totally fine once you hit Stranglethorne Valley and only get better from there. Them being terrible to level is mostly a meme.
---
They are harder than others, but not so much harder that it hinders you too much, and the reward for sticking to it is getting to play the flat out best class in classic. Pretty much best DPS if fury, only real tank.
---
Yes, congrats on "owning" me /clap. Man why you gotta be like this pepes hands man
---
What's the addon called for the bar on the top of your screen?
---
If you classify my comment as "attacking" then idk what to tell you man. Either you are living in a safe space or you are just too sensitive to general banter

Herbalism warlock here, already have a herb bag, should I get a soul bag as well? how do fellow warlocks deal with only three bags ?
---
Right clicking the bnet launcher in the task bar and selecting WoW launches retail, even if you have classic selected in the launcher. Support.
---
6 hours? I'm jealous. My priest quests are rather forgettable in comparison.
---
hunters arw not so easy as people seem to think in classic
---
hunters have less bag space, have to travel the world taming pets and learning skills to have a somewhat usefull pet. they dont hold aggro as well as you would think, have to feed em, mend pet couldnt out heal a rabbit nibbling on my pets feet, pets r somewhat buggy and sometes run off om their own regardless of your commands. you pull aggro from everything with hunters mark, up to lile lv 25ish+ your ranged is fairly shit compared to melee unless especially if you have decent melee weaps but shit ranged weap, hunter deadzone is a pain in the ass alot pf the time.. hunters arnt as easy as people think. may be easier than se classess like warriors but their not god tier solo classess lile retail imo
---
Just updated, right-clicking on Details to see which modes to use, and there's no threat option.
---
Im my experience, you're pretty helpless until you get death coil. Then you have more of a chance.
---
Very informative, thank you.
---
We demand additional lumber!
---
I was formally in guilds chasing world firsts. Now I can only play 1-2 hours a day and I am still having a blast, so yes definitely worth playing.
---
Shoutout Filthyfrank
---
here's an exercise for you. Open Classic by right clicking the bnet launcher in your task bar
---
Rez sickness pet capping is a manly move.
---
You should easily be able to find a more casual guild. This is what progress oriented players want though. Loot Council is ideal for pushing progression (and honestly I wouldn't want to raid in any guild that doesn't use it).
---
Op could have just layer hopped but chose to sit on the same layer like a pleb. The pet is not even bis so, time we'll wasted''
---
That sounds like banter? or words of a tool couldn't congratulate something and 'banter' is a pussy excuse to be a shithead- try and actually be funny  if your 'bantering' otherwise its just mean
---
Sick burn, bro.
---
So how do you loot? I remember trying to do something like this ages ago and realizing i still had to click corpse drops to loot them. Autoloot fortunately takes care of the inventory part.
---
Alliance or horde?
---
Me and my buddy yesterday felt like part of some kind of Vulture mafia while getting those bones there yesterday.
---
That looks terrible but enjoy I guess
---
Can't believe I've never heard of ConsolePort before. Setting up my stationary bike tomorrow.
---
p.s. the hunters mark part is a joke but we do pull aggro from everyone as threat is hard to maintain t lower lvls
---
Most people are aware of the potential for "suboptimal" classes/specs to fill roles. The recent rushing of MC has dispelled the notion that it's necessary to min/max. However with that all said, you're still facing the reality that a 40 man raid will be guaranteed to have priests. People will still hold the view that giving preference to a priest is "optimal". It's feasible that you find a guild that acknowledges *individual contribution* (i.e. distribute items based on the player, not the class). But, it's still an uphill fight based on game mechanics.
---
Wait a few minutes and it will catch up.  You'll notice whilst it's occurring that there's no chat appearing.  Wait 'til it does, then it's safe to hearth/try moving to a new zone.  I've had it on flightpaths and moving to a new zone (Barrens from Durotar/Orgr), reckon it's layer related.
---
Stop recommending changes, its how the game is meant to be, deal with it.
---
Nah sorry but WoWhead should have some informations
---
What a huntard who gives a fuck in a lvl 19 Dungeon
---
ELVUI works in Classic?
---
Interesting....
---
Nah mate, you either have some human decency and don't act like a greedy fuck or you get booted from the party. Theres a need/greed function for a reason, so I'm not gonna become a ninja looter  just to be able to play with a ninja looter in the party.
---
I’d hold onto it in your bank until the economy builds. But don’t expect a whole lot. It’s lackluster, and not a really coveted twinking item if I recall. Maybe like 30g on a server with a popping economy at the very highest in later game stages. Would maybe expect closer to 10g
---
I am getting the same vibe. Im now thinking when i reach lvl 30 this weekend and stsrt running sm as a warlock im wanting to aoe farm the dungeons. This sounds like most fun to me, so I will join aoe groups with other mages and locks.
---
I would get bored if the dungeon was going slow.
---
We were all on voice, and they all agreed I could have it, the delay was just due to the hype and shouting in Discord 😆
---
Has nothing to do with those things. Some people just do not want to pay for anything that can easily be pirated. An online friend from my teens was rich as fuck compared to me. He pirated **everything** he could get his hands on. Even games on steam sales for under 5 bucks. The group of friends I was in with him even bought him CS:S, CS:GO, World of Warcraft up to Cata and MoP at that time, Diablo 3 and RoS and Speedrunners (game on steam). Oh, and Garry's Mod. I met those guys when I was 13, we met a few months later at Gamescon and talked almost every day on our own TS3 server and skype before that. 
---
I never saw him buy anything that wasn't his own food or drinks. He quit WoW after three months because he didn't want to pay for the fee and just played on Atlantis (cata p-server) later on. He literally got a new BMW when he turned 19 and got his driver's license and didn't have to worry about money at all.
---
Our group fell apart when each of us finished school.
---
Spin up new Classic+ servers with enemy damage/HP buffed.
---
TBH I liked the WotLK talent trees a lot. I hope at some point we get those, as it made for more interesting specs and especially more viable specs.
---
You will have absolutely no succes posting here, even tho i see that it's a huge problem... Mabye reach out to Blizzard?
---
&gt;I try to RP whenever possible, but I’m new to RP so I’m probably not very good. 
---
Just remember that "RP"ing doesn't mean you only have to talk like a medieval poet.
---
Chinese people doing chinese things. They are nearly untouchable and by far the biggest community of hacker cheater and botter. Gold farming, boosting ... is a very very big market in china in all games resulting in a lot of money .
---
Money has more value then long-deserved justice so i guess blizzard won't/can't do much about that
---
Found it!

It is such a cool map and it only got 140 upvotes.

Like the keys A,S and D? How do you strafe? Im currently using mousebuttons for switching. Feels nice once you get used to it.
---
Flaming trolling and leaving games does not equal to hacking and cheating, how do you even link that?
---
It's only the snowflakes from rito that is triggered by BMs enough for it to warrant a ban. Dunkey made a great video about it, check it out.
---
That said, ruining games and leaving them are bad but im pretty sure there already is a report feature in said games right, and a penalty system?
---
there are 3 mobs only in LBRS that drops the pattern.The mats for the craft is  a pain to grind as well!

This is beautiful

Blueblobman best blobman
---
A whole bunch of add-ons were ported over to classic. Titan panel, auctionator, questie, bagnon, atlasloot to name a few
---
Says the guy using the "he's 12" line.
---
For some people "dead realm" is a synonym to "realm with no queue"
---
Man I'm out.
---
yes it's titan panel.
---
so bad
---
Well I am happy with it
---
This isn't correct afaik.
---
Eviscerate is generally a more effective use of combo points up until rank 2 S&amp;D at lvl 42 OR improved slice and dice talent. I've been experimenting with using SnD instead of evis because I was curious, and it does less DPS overall. You're not going to be getting full uptime off high combo point SnD if you're solo, and low rank SnD isn't worth it for the energy cost unless those combo points would otherwise be wasted. 
---
Slice and Dice isn't useless, but it shouldn't be your go to when leveling. It's great situationally. Dumping your combo points if the damage would be overkill/you don't have enough energy for an evis/you need to change targets. Focus down an add, dump your combo points into a Slice and Dice and go nuts on the boss.
---
I like what you did with my gnome:)
---
" in my ideal world, classic is successful enough that Blizzard sees value in developing new content for it "
---
Well then I guess I won't be part of it, because I'll unsub the very second something like this is announced.
---
" Can Blizzard in its current state create great content like they did in TBC and WotLK? "
---
Nope.
---
How do you play without a healthbar?
---
Alli gets three easy to access rings: blue from quest starting from VanCleef, killing named ogre in loch modan and then there's ring in redridge too.
---
Where can you find out your servers ratio of horde vs alliance?
---
You should still go there but groupe with other people that XP (just ask in the zone channel)).
---
They wont attack you if you're always 3-5 players. It's a good way to make the xp grind fun/less boring.
---
In Desolace, you don't respawn, instead a copy of you replaces you. Identical in every way, but not ***you***.
---
Wc is just... extremely intricate. SFK is one of those I love a lot due to the length and simplicity of the route lol. Fight, release a rogue for the Nth time, killdog, kill ghost bosses, kill BIG dog, kill papa wizard.
---
I just wish Arugal drops Meteorshard though pepehands....
---
How, i wanted to share my ideas, so it’s a perfect post
---
\[walltext incoming\]
---
Basically, what **WoW classic need is more horizontal progression** to TBC or WOTLK doesn’t make all your leveling or hardwork of the previous extension useless.
---
**HOWEVER, we still need some vertical progression.**
---
So, how would i do that ?
---
Release TBC as normal (with class change etc), but **make the mobs much stronger**. Not elite-level, but strong enough so a lvl 60 geared for Naxx or AQ couldn’t pull more than 1 or 2, and undergeared lvl 60 would need to group or help each other.
---
Make the alliance/horde quests in this area being a little closer to each other to encourage JcJ. It’s the entry to freaking outland, make it epic, make it a hard fight !
---
Then, instead of having to go to level 70… go to level 61.
---
**Yes, one level only. Every area is level 60/61**. So, after hellfire peninsula, you can level up wherever you want. Make the quest loot somewhat stronger than dungeon or MAYBE raid 1 tier, but not as good as the late NAXX/AQ. 
---
Only the raids from TBC being stronger. But not by that much. **Make the sets more diverse**. In classic, most of the sets are very good for one spec, like the paladin sets mostly being good for healers but bringing nothing for the tanks. **Creating sets adapted for every spec** so everyone have an interest to go in raid even if it doesn’t give them a lot of superior stats.
---
Basically, ungeared 60 &lt; dungeon tier 60 &lt; hellfire peninsula and TBC areas &lt; first raids tier 60 &lt; TBC dungeons &lt; end raid tier 60 &lt; end raid tier TBC
---
But how to motivate people to progress ?
---
Still make them stronger. Give one talent point every 20% of the level, and the 5 last when the character ding at level 61. **Make the new skills a reward of each area’s dungeon, to motivate people to explore and quest everywhere and visit the world**.
---
Also, **include glyphs and archeology**. Those two professions don’t break the game. The first bring a lot of personnalisation, and the second encourage to come back and visit the entire world, including Azeroth.
---
Don’t make Shattrath the new capital, so people still stay at Stormwind.Orgrimmar. I admit i don’t really know how to do it.
---
Also, **add something else than gear to motivate people to raid. My ideas ? QOL feature**. Unlocking bonuses like double spec after beating Illidan, for example, or reducing heartstone cooldown with Karazhan, something like that.
---
**Also, no flying mounts.**
---
Add new recipes and craft specializations !
---
I had this issue, it was really strange. Looks like the fps change fixed it though.
---
I'd be surprised if any PvP server is alliance dominated.
---
It should be a standard 24 hours between accounts
---
Good luck mate you're getting close!
---
It is dead, it's a brand new server that's not even open to new characters yet, only people transferring. It'd be pretty great for hunters grabbing a rare pet.
---
Well stonetalon is basicly a horde zone imo. but Ashenvale there shouldnt be any problem to team up. Only problem is its hard for 60s to come assist all away from eastern kingdom
---
Well the thing is I have yet to add any friend, people aren't talking much when i group anyway. But this has always been somewhat the case. It's until i meet them again and again that we know each other more and we start doing random shit together.
---
I fondly remember a night elf war that i was meeting doing almost the exact same shit that me at the same time and we started doing alot of thing together. None of this is happening right now on blizzard server.
---
Saw a screenshot of an orc with 20000 Staff of Jordans in their bank.
---
Lmao, dude you gotta have some problem if you take it that way.. maybe talk to someone?
---
So true. :) Have the same story with my nightelf hunter.
---
good, come back with a different attitude
---
ellite player frame addon!
---
You on Earthfury?
---
&gt;They will go up to Wrath if they want and that's it
---
I'd agree with that. Wrath struck a real tight balance for the classes, had the most interesting raid content with regards to fight mechanics (of which vanilla had a glimpse in Naxx, and which built further upon the Karazhan experience) and the best atmosphere. I'd like them to stick with what was good there and then take it a new direction.
---
I think people really only gatekeep the speed-runners because they're going to be the ones who stop playing or complain that phases are too far away. The last thing the rest of us want is the speed-running no-life players to become the voice of the community.
---
And being a Panda Friend
---
Spartanui with the gel set, feels really warlocky
---
Not sure the server is the same but sorry for your loss anyway !

The person literally saying th term derived from is the gatekeeper. This is precisely the point I was trying to make, simpleton.

I think bite its 10 sec cd?
---
Some say that only claw is better and some say that oppening with bite and then only claw is better,but overall claw is a most i think
---
I use vanaskos, you can get it from wowace
---
I said rule breaking not cheating.
---
I've noticed the same, I hope it is not intended it is very annoying and makes some pulls impossible.
---
Yeh got like 4 x 10 slot bags yesterday from enemy drops.
---
All in the same zone in less than 4 hours
---
Our guild discord has a channel #kill-list for exactly this purpose.
---
I feel a lot of pity for the high elves because of this, especially after playing the War3 campaign lol. Cut off from magic, despised by human allies.... they couldn't do anything but run to Illidan in a desperate move for survival.
---
Were u on mirage raceway?
---
Thought this was gruntilda from the thumbnail
---
Its there and only a matter of time till there are boosts. My unpopular opinion is that I think its gonna be ok to do it.
---
For example naxx rolls out and the population is stable, why would it be bad if they added char boosts when it would mostly benefit players that already have a 60?
---
Maybe everyone's leveling and not sitting in the capital? Even when my realms full, stormwind isn't that busy since everyone is racing for level 60
---
&gt; Deadly Boss Mods 
---
the classic version
---
also GTFO which basically warns you to get the fuck out of the fire
---
Kronos had non blizzlike Los. Classic Los is working as intended
---
Everything doesn't occlude LoS, you'll have to learn which things you can shoot through and which ones you can't. "Normal" trees like in the oases in Barrens are too thin to block LoS, as are most rocks you can just jump over etc. IIRC it's always been like that, but haven't played super much yet so maybe I'll also notice something odd down the road.
---
Had 2 epic boes in BRD, this shield and some staff. They were both passed onto the player that would actually use them.
---
I believe they called him that so the anagram at the end of book 2 would work in French as well (don’t quote me on that though) 
---
But I meant the overuse of the word baguette
---
Isn't ubrs shield just better in every way for a tank? Seems like a waste.
---
Hello darkness my old friend..
---
From what I've read Deviate Delight is 60-40 in Alliance's favor.
---
In my case it was a chart signature request @ lvl 7 on release night, without a word. I was rushing, I just clicked Accept to help without overthinking it.
---
Now I'm still in this guild. It's fine so far, they're nice people.
---
But some pieces are BiS for like 10+ levels (so like weeks for some players). This isn't retail where you change gear constantly while leveling. That was(is) the whole point of some dungeon drops or crafted gear.
---
Yeah, there are some situations like needing a pure casting ring as feral druid or a staff that's clearly for a Priest, but in general? Nah.
---
I thought you couldn’t transfer realms?
---
Theb look again,you can clearly see northrend shape and pandaria shape at the logo and some globos in the game(i think there is one in SM)
---
Thank you for copying the content for those at work ! Though it's really annoying that almost all work firewalls blocks everything related to wow, while letting go many porn sites XD but well, that's the world we live in
---
Not really, he claimed there wasn’t more than 4 or 5 layers while the blizz post said it could be 8-9
---
&gt;no new level cap...
---
The main attraction to me, in WotLK, are the reworked talent trees (same for TBC). I can see them lock talent points behind quests as an alternative, but that will make for a very railroaded experience. So I'd say it's OK to raise the level cap
---
&gt; I know it seems like everybody only wants shaman healers but there are uses for enh or elemental shamans.
---
In 5 mans at least, I will generally take Shaman healers in favour of Priests.
---
a}  Good enough (if not quite ***as*** good) healing and resurrection.
---
b}  The only Horde healer capable of wearing mail, which grants them extra survivability.
---
c}  Although this varies by individual player, they are generally more emotionally stable, and have less of an entitlement complex than Priest players.
---
When I am tanking, I will admit that a DPS Shaman is not my first choice for main assist, due to their ability to pull threat with their shocks; however, the bonus of an additional res will generally mitigate that complaint in my mind.  A Shaman is probably more likely to be a loot ninja than a Priest or some other DPS classes, as well; simply because, like Hunters, they can equip a wide array of gear.
---
You have to be a hunter, and at least level 10 in order to get a big pet, it also fights for you.
---
There are also cosmetic pets, but they are tiny and don't do anything besides follow you around. Those, you get as either rare world drops or dungeon/raid drops which are usually more common.
---
I have a soft spot for the visuals and music as my first char in classic was a night elf druid so I love that teldrassil/ashenval music.
---
But my god Ashenvale is such a horrible zone to quest in.
---
This is how it was in classic.
---
Did they rly remove that from classic? Wow..
---
Yes. Blizzard offered a free realm transfer to a new server to resolve some queue issues
---
Then I just need to get lucky enough to have the pattern drop... Looking at how long I had to kill raptors in Arathi to get 12 hearts, it's not looking too good, hah. The worst part is having to clear all of Scholo to get to Gandling to even have a chance.
---
Is Classic WoW really this boring?  I'm playing a Ret Paladin and from what I can tell, I'm only going to be using 3 abilities to level.  First I'll activate my Seal, consume it with Judgement, reactivate my seal and auto attack the enemy to death.  Later on I'll get to Consecrate and then I can heal myself in between pulls.
---
Am I missing anything?
---
umm... so you are saying that a low level player could just run around tagging mobs and have his higher level buddy one shot the mobs, giving the low level player full xp. I really doubt that would work.
---
IMO, general rule should be - you join with randoms - expect anything to happen.
---
no
---
The troll ruins in Hinderlands for example...big structures...walls...mobs shoot right through
---
got level 20 2 days ago and spent yesterday only for mining.
---
But this weekend i want to go full on, will see how it goes.:)
---
Worldof world of warcraft
---
Why would they hang out when all of the content is in outlands? And shattrath had portals to everywhere you needed, shattrath was the main hub.....
---
Macros on Warrior are like mandatory we really live the hardest but best life.
---
My rules: if I get the opener I always fear first then Dot and shadowbolt... and run and Hope his wof will end before he can catch me ( if it’s melee). Man but if he opens on me I’m helpless. Can’t use fear and Srsly no chance. Hope at 60 my toolkit will allow some shit to react.
---
You get normal reputation for green quests and it declines afterwards. At 60 your only option are a few grindy repeatable quests.
---
Gotta love Samwise.

Lol k.

^this

Will be the same Rep. You can give cloth to raise your rep in every Capital .
---
nobody said that the guy attacking a tagged mob would be getting xp/shards
---
Most people say Paladins are the most boring to level.
---
/shrug
---
Arenas were fine. I did not like them but I wasn't forced to play them either. However, the removal of the honor system, in my opinion, was the breaking point of pvp.
---
I still enjoyed pvp in bc and wrath but the honor system made it much much more interesting.
---
My mom is 54 (I’m 22) and is carrying me through my wow classic experience! She and my dad ran a raiding guild for years.

Just so you know, it's Bagnon, not Baggon.
---
In what way does this relate to WoW classic?
---
Parry this Ye fookin casual.
---
There are plenty of other games to play if this one doesnt suite you. 
---
Just dont play.  Whats the issue?
---
The population of nost was the single worst aspect of it, aside from the scripting, but now we are treading into /r/wowservers type conversations.
---
Let me guess.  Rogue?
---
Morning + layering + this thread explain it
---
Wait are you in Herod? We're you talking about this in Hillsbrad today?
---
did someone talk about xp distribution? he said that the person being 'helped' will receive less xp since he got assisted
---
Not yet.
---
I absolutely love these moments no matter the game I play!
---
I know it's kinda unrelated but I had a very similar experience in an FFXI "dungeon" (more like a specific mission fight in a closed area only accessible to the party) and after a dozen tries and lots of swearing and desperation, the boss is literally at &lt;1% life and everybody died, I'm the last one standing and I casually just throw in a level 1 offensive spell not even hoping to do anything (as a healer class they did basically nothing), and actually kill it. Felt so damn good
---
Buy a cheap second monitor.
---
It might be true for world pvp encounters. But it's irrelevant for me atleast, world pvp would never be fair anyway because of countless other factors. The most fun you are ever going to have in classic pvp is pre-made vs pre-made battlegrounds where you will have well rounded team comps and "rock paper scissors" is out the window at that point.
---
Also if the one who kills is much higher level you will get around 8-10 xp
---
WoW classic players telling each other to stop gatekeeping rushing to 60.
---
I'm third on the "life rocks" wagon.
---
thank you
---
Yep I'm also looking for stuff like that : where are the vendors for an item, list all the recipes the item is used for, all the quests, etc
---
basically the information we get on wowhead, but without actually having to copy paste and go search on wowhead (which is a very specific pain in the ass when you play in another language than english, because the search sucks, i actually have to search using google "wowhead &lt;name of item&gt; while the wowhead search itself basically shits itself)

Currently have a 32 hunter and 34 mage 11 lock.

Final submission is in 23 days. Oh shit now I'm scaring myself lol. Gonna have to limit myself to 1 hour a day.
---
&gt; Oh the lies we students tell ourselves.
---
Unfortunately like with most casters, if a melee dps gets the opener on a caster then you're finished. If by some stroke of luck you manage to get out of that melee range within the first I dunno 1-2  seconds of combat and can effectively slow or stop their movement then you have a chance. It's the only thing that has ruined me playing as rogue is when I cant get close, so i assume it works for all Melee.

Doding veel te lvl 60 should erease your character. That  woud flavor classic hardcore servers
---
ATM machine
---
Machanics wise it's pretty straight forward and easy. You'll need a bit of spatial awareness and get to know your aggro range/pull distances, but that's something you'll learn naturally while leveling. Don't worry too much about it, Classic is pretty far from some of the more crazy machanics retail has nowadays.
---
Just hit freewind post do finish up a quest or two before hitting the shimmering flats tonight. I always had fond memories of doing the flats for some reason.
---
Flats &gt; Desolace &gt; STV the run up to Mount time.
---
Soul and herb bags would only be worth it if they are bigger than other bags you would have instead *and* you fill them up more than you could a normal bag. If you have 5 soul shards there's no reason not to just have them take up 5 spaces in a regular bag.
---
For leveling you really don't need many soul shards, especially since it's probably a good idea to get the improved drain soul talent. Some leveling macros exist to remove a soul shard when you start casting drain soul just so you don't fill your bags.
---
Save yourself the bag equip slot and just have a few shards in case you die and need to resummon your pet. Otherwise there's no real reason not to immediately convert them to health or soul stones while leveling.
---
Well they didnt have the layering tehnologies. Thry were just bunch of french pepel tryina do shit for free. I mean if blizzard couldnt predict player count how could they
---
Big structures and walls should block it IMO, but then again, my memory of these details from 15 years back might be a bit fuzzy (that's being generous). 
---
But it's probably best to assume that LoS in Classic can be a bit wonky. However, if you find that one specific type of wall layout blocks LoS, you'll notice the model probably is re-used in other areas as well (Tanaris perhaps, or ZF) and that it will block LoS there as well. There should be that much consistency at least.
---
omegalul lvl 20 ive 5 60s and cleared MC 42 times already u casul
---
The thing is in most case this isn't even fast. In the best case you have to drink a lot and there is alot of downtime, in the worst case this is a wipe fest because people don't even know what they are doing.
---
The fastest run i had there was actually the one doing this the normal way.
---
Let's just not mention horde having easy zeppelin access between major cities while alliance gets a boat to some random ass harbor in the middle of nowhere.
---
No, aka "idiotic wow players THINK they can exploit it, so they're ruining their own experience as well as the experience of everyone else, despite not actually having any impact on anything, so we're preventing that".
---
Game design is largely not just about making a good game, but also about ensuring that stupid players can't ruin their own fun by playing in the worst possible way that they THINK is optimal.
---
Blizzard here is taking steps to cut that. Stuff like this is mainly psychology, not something that indicates a real problem people are actually abusing. Which is kinda worse.
---
I've seen so many hilarious posts on this sub the last few days.
---
We're either all just happy to be playing Classic, or this is what collective, severe sleep deprivation looks like.
---
Just yesterday I was doing a series of quests in the Night Elf starting zone and I died *just* before completing the last part (my dagger broke lol), and the person I was grouping with bailed on me. So I went back there and grouped with someone who was just starting the chain of quests and I helped him through the whole thing, even though I incidentally finished my last quest early on. 
---
He kept thanking me and saying I could leave if I wanted to, but honestly it just felt nice to be there adventuring with someone. Just being in the cave with them struggling to survive felt more immersive than anything I've experienced in any modern MMO.
---
YEAH MATE GAMES DEAD BACK TO RETAIL KTHXBYE
---
Rule out 1 in need. Every caster and healer uses cloth, at least partially, because the itemization sucks.
---
*cries in feral* as it seems almost impossible to explain  people that they need to give mobs some time to hit you before starting PDSing like mad.
---
You're the real winner.
---
Dadada dad dadada da the boys are back in town.
---
Tip of the day: 
---
Go to YouTube and play a video 
---
Right click on it twice 
---
Select picture in picture
---
😃
---
That’s the way to go imo! Previous epics we got were not really usable to anyone, we ended up greeding for those :)
---
Only issue is what happens to the classic servers afterward tho...
---
Today:
---
Defended Raven Hill for an hour solo patrolling for 2 horde baddies... Then 5 of us grouped up a couple hours later and got payback in STV on a couple horde that were higher levels than us! 
---
Not sure what you're doing on your server but I made choices to be positive in local defense and we handled busyness on Bigglesworth like bosses! 
---
The adrenaline of the 5 of us taking out a level 37 hunter... and then shaman or whatever like... I can't explain. We were all like 30...
---
Not sure what realm you're on but try to be the difference,  others will join you eventually. Actions my friend. Have fun!
---
Yup or people who have mounts can use the same macro you wrote except with /dismount instead of cancelform to not have to remove the mount buff to be able to cast spells. For example:
---
#showtooltip Frost Nova(Rank 1)
---
/dismount
---
/cast Frost Nova(Rank 1)
---
Well aren't those realms locket for non realm transfer people ? + They are very new.
---
Honestly why should someone transfere to a complete new realm when joining a medium to high realm would be much better. They should have made free rt from full to every other realm rather then making new once.
---
shadow gear works fine, feral gear not so much
---
What level are you?
---
Need to know specs but WoW in its classic state has very low spec requirements.
---
Raiding might be taxing but for simple levelling it’s fine.
---
I’m running WoW Classic on the go with a surface laptop with i5, 4gb ram and HD iGPU without an issue at all. Small stutters here and there but perfectly fine for simple levelling etc.
---
you seem pretty dumed down yourself mate
---
Yeah in this case we can kick the morons who rolled need for selling it because, obviously everybody needs gold and you would make the whole need/greed system unnecessary if you just roll need on anything to sell it. 
---
 And then we will let little jimmy get the next item he could need for sure to show him that not everybody playing this game is a greedy fuck only focused on himself ;)
---
What if you die or get ganked?
---
Can you ever lose it or have it die on you or is it like a permanent pet?
---
Nice undead still have these kind of interests
---
I’m no longer a student with no life. I have a very good career now, make lots of money, only work 3 days per week, and can have everything I ever wanted... yet now I somehow just want to spend my 4 days off each week to play WoW.
---
I haven’t put off my friends yet, but damn if I haven’t thought about ditching them to go play.
---
If you trust blizzards word then I have some bad news for you...
---
Layers have indeed screwed the economy hard and there are massive glaring issues that still stay. I abuse layer hoping every chance I get.
---
Honestly this makes me feel good. My pc took a shit the day before classic launched. But since people are dealing with the server queues, I figure by the time I get my pc working again it will all be sorted out. Wooo!
---
My brother is rolling 1 Warrior, 1 Mage, 1 Priest and 2 warlocks.  He has portals, free food/water, summons, revives, heals and a tank, plus 4 wand users for simple, free damage.  He's able to handle most dungeons, but some of the bosses give him trouble like Firehammer in Uldaman because of the AoE damage and CC required.
---
It took him a while to set up macros and his UI so that he can handle the more intense situations that the middle and higher level dungeons require, but he's enjoying it a lot.  The macro to cast Blizzard/Rain of Fire on yourself changed his world.
---
Classes have some unique advantages that you'll feel throughout the whole leveling process. Try thinking about the situations you might end up in and how you want to handle them with each class. Both are viable for PvP/PvE, but they bring a distinct flair to the way you play them. Mages handle things more easily than Rogues, but Rogues will always have the stealth advantage in PvP.
---
How do you make more in-game gold?
---
Most of the jailtime I've heard for cheating in S.Korea is of the kind that involves game fixing for gamblers, which is a crime almost everywhere that allows gambling on the outcomes of events.
---
In what ways are Shamans painful to level? The access to on-demand-healing in order to be able to deal with multiple enemies you own level, or all that annoying utility from the horrendous multitude of totems? Maybe that blasted Ghost Wolf that no one ever asked for, or... Sorry, I can't go further.
---
And I don't think you're pigeon holed into healing, but you will have an easier time finding a group if you're willing to cover that role from time to time - which is quite doable even if you're enh/ele specced, as long as you keep some Int/Spi gear as well. Hell, Shamans can even tank most content up until level 50ish - some even tanked MC back in the day.
---
thats so funny I tried to get toxic for my cousin so we could all have our names on that realm. I ended up getting the names I wanted and a few others for friends who are working.
---
I assume your bad hair day us due to the rains down in Stranglethorn. MARGE.
---
Sure:
---
For myself it was always mainly a convenience thing. If I have my own group of characters, I'm not reliant on others to play. With limited play time and an erradic schedule it's great just to get to log in and play when it works for you. Also since it's just you there are no AFKers, rage quitters, no ninja looters, I don't inconvenience people if I need to randomly go AFK due my kid waking up, and so on.
---
Playing multiple characters adds tremendous depth in to the game as well. Having to handle tanking, healing, dispells, dps, movement and instance mechanics all on your own is a fun challenge.
---
Also the setup is fun to fiddle with and it's sort of it's own meta game. There are a wide variety of ways you can choose to handle different things and testing, fine tuning and completely reworking your setup is a substantial amount of the fun for a lot of us.
---
Knock knock
---
I've seen Shamans running around like this firsthand and they rock.
---
I think first phase will be around 2-4 months.
---
Thanks, I feel like I'll be shamed to lose to non elite players now, will motivate me
---
&gt; You can heal leveling dungeons without healing spec or healing gear just fine
---
All your gear give +int and it's basically all you need to heal while leveling. So, for priest all gear is basically heal gear. + Spell power gear appears later.
---
A cat
---
thanks for your help!
---
Check out that noise.
---
Be careful. It depends on the cloth.
---
Linen or wool is less worth AS Bandage.
---
Silk ist more worth as Heavy bandange.
---
But Mageweave ist more worth as normal Bandage.
---
Accepted? 
---
Aren't these people asked to ban PDD asian?
---
Fuck you and your racist mind.
---
No it doesn't. The spawns are still the same. 
---
Now we have 2x-9x the spawns. It's how copper ore has ended up at literally coppers per piece rather than the silver or so it normally sits.
---
A Hunter knows Tailoring?
---
It's China what do you expect?
---
It's hit or miss. Sometimes they just teleport and sometimes they run around and aggro everything, it's best to dismiss first.
---
If u get opened on by a melee, ur already at a disadvantage same way as a caster opens up on me. Shit happens.
---
I mean good on them for making a server that got “real” popular when others couldn’t. 
---
But to hold nost up as this lone paragon of classic wow virtue is completely disingenuous to all those who came before nost, and those who existed when nost did, but never vowed to a C&amp;D letter from across an ocean. It completely ignores things like feenix, scriptcraft, mang0s, Kronos, or the plethora of bc and wrath servers that had all the 1-60 non raid shit scripted as well.
---
The call for classic went on for years before nost, and if not for them, nost would’ve never come out, or if it did, it wouldn’t have been half the product it was. 
---
If we are gonna suck the dicks of a bunch of pirates, at least suck off the guys who started it, not the dudes who showed up six dicks late.
---
THE RAINS ARE 'ERE!
---
Omg a chinese player who is cheating in an MMO? Im shocked!. Not really shit happens ALL the time and cause of China's who gives a fuck attitude it goes massively unpunished unless they are literally bombarded with evidence and public call outs.
---
I always played humans and NE, in Classic i decided to try out dwarves
---
But tanks can't wear plate. Only dps and healers can. And they mostly choose not to.
---

---
Classic WoW is not as rotationally in depth as retail. I think very few people would argue that. Warlock raid rotation against bosses is: 1) Shadowbolt. Frost Mage is: 1) Frostbolt. There are a few more intricacies for min-maxing but it's just simpler. Even considering those 2, I almost always hear that ret paladin is the most boring dps spec. Maybe it's not the class for you. Maybe pvp will be more your thing.
---
You know I could've written 30 minutes or an hour there. You completely missed my point.
---
OP had an adventure and he shared his excitement. Yet here is that other guy telling him he's stupid having his fun.
---
Why must everything be optimal? Why is everything go-go-go-go? Let people have their fun.
---
Not only does China not represent the whole of Asia, one Chinese person does not represent the whole of China. I also doubt you are a viable/ reliable source of information regarding Asian culture. Be careful with your words. You sound like a biggot.
---
I'm on Shazzrah (EU)
---
Murphy, is that you? How you doin' you old pirate?
---
where is your health, mana etc?
---
since blizz said most servers are in low single digit numbers, this means below 5.
---
This is what all these transfer realms look like currently. I guess blizzard vastly underestimated the amount of players that would be willing to transfer.
---
I moved from Mograine &gt; Judgement last night. Ironforge and Stormwind looked exactly like this, except it was at 9pm in the evening.
---
Not good.
---
\&gt;Work, kids, 5k que  
---
You don't work 24/7 and while kids take up a ton of time you still get time away from both. And if a long que time is something thats deterring you from playing there are plenty of servers with med and low pops. Remember that a even a med pop server today has way more people on it than a full server from back in the day.   
---
And if you're still determined to say you can't play because of this and that then find something else to do.
---
Amen
---
You are a network admin, and you dont event know how to take a screenshot?
---
damn thanks
---
Doesn't mean a lot, there is like 20 time more players in auberdine than in darnassus for example
---
I mean, with some Googling you can probably still find end-game DPS logs or rankings for the classes in vanilla. If end-game scaling is what you're basing your choice of class on, and you see yourself doing Naxx and AQ raids, then that's what you ought to look up.
---
It's out of two options. 
---
1. They go through the phases as they have planned out for content then after 2 years or so they release tbc with character transfer from classic, however ur char will remain on classic too. So you have the choice to stick to classic or progress to tbc. 
---
2. It's a similar situation to oldschool runescape where they stick to the classic format but just add new content which sticks true to classic and doesn't sway to another expansion of gameplay.
---
\- 4 day old account  
---
\- only hating on Wow classic and trying to push " XD wow classic already dead Pepega" meme 
---
So this is what all the salty retail players are doing in the meantime
---
Why is that? My thought process is that blizzard has a 72% spell damage coefficient and can't crit.
---
I'm loving these so far. Recognized both quests without the title because I've been doing them myself. It's fun!
---
That’s super cool!
---
Love little interactions like this :)
---
These posts are giving me such anxiety. I'm only lvl 30 and feel i am leveling too slow. 
---
Anyone else feel this way?
---
If you have an XBox (preferrably XBox One) controller you can set this up on Android too. I've been planning to do it for a long time, but haven't had the time and willpower to set up Console Port. But Moonlight works perfectly on Android.
---
They don't do normal LoS. If they can see you at the time they press the button, then if the attack was going to hit, it does. It's just the animation that is delayed so it looks weird. Same happens for players. A gnoll can run as far and fast as it likes, if my arcane shot was already fired, it's going chase him.
---
I am Level 34 and Tank with whirlwind axe. I cleave mobs down with almost 300 dps (though I had wf totem). How is this inferiour to dual wield? Don’t forget impale - 120% Crit has a much higher total dmg with 2 Hand when cleaving and off hand dmg ist neglectable. 
---
Point taken I don’t have the steady ap increase from imp shout, yet the sole talent that is desirable is enrage (maybe imp cleave?). While I have imp rend, deep wounds (dependent on wpn avg dmg), impale, imp overpower (dependent on wpn max dmg) and sweeping strikes.
---
Actually it came with wrath, BC added rampage for fury
---
very nice, I hope it get to  developer of ElvUI. beacuse I don't trust myself enough to try to get it.
---
Ha,Already picked engineer since I head its good for PvP,will keep that in mind
---
They showed late because they were scripting it for a long ass time.  Kronos was the only one that was good script wise but iirc it came out few months after nost did. Love them or hate them. It is because of THEM that classic is a thing anyways.
---
Or you could also just get more monitors
---
Thank you for showing me not all people are assholes because last topic I stated my oppinion about that. I was tag teamed by 2 already personal blocked user which said BoE need roll would be no ninja because they want to sell it ...
---
I don't really care about those people if something like that happens i gonna add them to my blacklist addon with the note "Need on BoE to sell" and next time they apply for a group im tanking in they won't get invited
---
Hello again, is there any essential add-ons I should be using? I don't have any at the minute. Thanks!
---
I couldnt find Simplemap
---
Considering there aren't that many layers, I think you're just making all of that up. But no, if you try making a new character you'd still see issues with leveling with layering still in effect.
---
how does every class lost its uniqueness in BFA ? Every spec is very different from each other now, and survival hunters are fully melee now !
---
Nah the workers just said they will be back in an hour.
---
\*looks at clock\* "We still got our left guys"
---
Snap :)
---
I said they keep the classic servers in my comment.
---
^ draconian deflector is your pre bis. That shield is good for aoe farming and that’s about it. A bit of a waste tbh.
---
Depends on your skill and the skill of the player you're facing. Hunters have it easier, but you can still manage to kill them, specially when you manage to exploit their melee zone. Maxlevel is fine, but your pet won't scale as much later on.
---
What do you mean? Layer swapping has helped me hundreds of times at this point, making my questing process considerably quicker.
---
I have 3 possible approaches I would be happy with if executed properly:
---
1) expansions as we know them, but without the features that ended up ruining the game. No flying, no CRZ, no LFD, no LFR, no talent tree redesign, no class identity redesign... So basically a do-over for the better...
---
or
---
2) a completely new expansion cycle, new timeline, new stories. again, very important not to add the features that ruined retail over time.
---
3) horizontal progression, new content while remaining lvl 60 and without adding much new features. this is my least favorite option though.
---
I think there is some hivemindoverlord controlling us.
---
Find one for vendor pricing.
---
That's great, thanks for the answer!
---
Gonna look into getting one soon then :D
---
whats the supposed lvling rotation then?
---
usually i went with 2x sunder armor, 1x rend then one heroic strike one more basic attack and the mob is dead.
---
or am i supposed to spam sunder armor for lvling?
---
neckbeard bashing disguised as sincerity.  
---
good one op
---
As I understand it, the /who requests were claimed to be made in unison, coordinated by the data channel. With the assumption that /who only showed those that share your layer, two people running /who within milliseconds of one another would more than likely have the same dataset. Sorted similarly and hashed, would make for more efficient comparison instead of sending a list of 49 player names over a chat channel, especially when there was said to be a collection of players employing the alleged addon. So imagine the spam of that addon channel with 49 names (probably split into multiple messages) vs 1 short hash from every participant.
---
And wago.io for weak auras
---
I've played horde for more than 7 years, i switched Ally to change prospective (and because of friends) but i will never yell "FOR THE ALL..."  
---
See, i can't say it.
---
Love this response!
---
They'll probably release them based on player progress. Once they decide enough people have hit 60, they'll release phase 2.
---
Well then the "quests will be so crowded" thing also doesn't matter i guess.
---
see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d00ha1/i_spent_years_trying_and_failing_to_get_the/ez4slb4/)

That's so kind of him! I also had a fellow mage yesterday who was kind enough to help me and my friend out and even let us have all the loot there was.
---
I go around buffing them with the highest rank of recklessness that I have.
---
Or fearing them if they are versus a melee class.
---
Damn I love Peggle, is this in the game yet ?
---
yah and why don't we add Greater Rifts while we're at it, ruining yet another game in the process :)

This is the thing about pretty much all of the warrior quests. I don't know about the other classes, having always played a warrior in vanilla and classic, but honestly...the rewards are not worth the work you put into them, power-wise. Sure they're fine but none of them are THAT good as to justify the work required to earn them.
---
But that's the point. You earned them. You put in the work and effort and sweat, and you got a story about that time you spent 6-7 hours with a new friend and went on an adventure to get an axe. Could you have just kept leveling and gotten a higher level axe? Yes. Could you have just done Herod a few times and gotten a Ravager? Also yes. Would any of that feel as good as the experience of getting the Whirlwind axe? Hell no.
---
Sounds more like a job for a Mage. They're efficient but need some downtime too. Hunters can go for longer but won't kill as much.
---
For me, in retail it's really hard to distinguish casters and melee DPS. Sure, tanks and healers have some uniqueness, but the rest just feels so.. samey. Like I get that they look different, but they feel very similar.
---
I actually love questing there. Some pvp some quests and less crowded as Westfall
---
I'm a priest. I'm healing. I'm disc+holy. Problem, OP?
---
I'm currently level 44 and I've heard tales of some of the struggles of making money as a healing priest at 60. So what are some reliable ways of doing it? Currently going for mining/skinning and switching skinning for engineering for pvp.
---
I had the same experience, got the first 3 hooves in my first 5 kills,was thinking, hey this isnt so bad as everyone makes it out to be... 4th one took me at least 10 more kills though.
---
This comment checks out with the childish guild that youre fan of
---
Again, if they roll need on shit just to sell it, they are out. When we run dungeons we can heal/tank and dps so we dont hesitate kicking ninja looters. And they do get really salty, its actually more than enough compensation to lose a little bit of money to witness some kid having a mental breakdown because we refuse to deal with his BS
---
This. I thought all isekai animes were utter shit until I saw Log Horizon. It does such a good job of managing to be entertaining to adults as well. It's an anime where, if I saw it as a kid, I would have understood about 100x less than I do now. And either way it's complex enough to require multiple watches, and doesn't try to overexplain the ridiculousness of isekai's leaving those parts entirely ambiguous (as they should be).
---
Damn
---
If you have the regular yellow/red armor warning not displayed or if you want it earlier, probably not.

What’s good about Broken Tooth?
---
Downvoting streamers is not much but honest job
---
I know, it actually work in high-end dungeons, but in low-leveled one is hard to get rage at all, you're slow, mobs don't hit you hard, the only rage-generating skill have a cooldown. Basically the things that makes you a good tank, works against you. It's a bit funny.
---
I was making a broad and general statement. Miss a backstab would be the correct thing, but I think the point was still the same :)
---
Alliance only quest?
---
Edit 3 of [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d00ha1/i_spent_years_trying_and_failing_to_get_the/ez4vio2/) is relevant here.
---
Fun fact: The titan panels I'm using are 40 (semi-transparent) pixels high each. On a 1440p monitor that's nothing, and I think a UI with absolutely *zero* visual elements looks worse. If you want to have a glorified Shift+Z go for it, but personally I think the panels help to retain a bit of the fantasy vibe and help to anchor the rest of the UI (while also having semi-useful information of their own).
---
Somewhere between 4th quarter of 2019 to end of 2020.

Cheating is culturally normalized in China. It’s 100% a “if you’re not cheating, you’re not trying” culture.
---
Which makes sense when they steal the worlds intellectual property as habitually as they do.
---
But unless blizzard can force netease’s hand, unlikely anything will be done.
---
Just enjoy it m8 no stress.
---
Im only 22, ive other stuff to do than World of Warcraft.
---
This , especially the doing instanced with friends
---
Once you're level 30, pickpocketing everything will likely mean you never, or hardly ever, need to buy your poisons.  Also, healing potions and gems.
---
You should be using swords unless they're significantly worse than the alternative. 
---
That being said, it only matters when you get the Sword Specialization in your thirties, before that go with whatever has the better stats. After getting the Sword Specialization talent I'll use swords unless the alternative has 5dps more than the sword, though this is just an estimate based on nothing than convenience, it is far from accurate. 
---
Also, remember to get a swingtimer add on once you get the Sword Specialization talent, you need it to optimize your damage.
---
The Facebook post that was circulating around earlier this week was fake.

If I'm in a group with people from my guild or raid group, any upgrade we get will improve our raid performance no matter who gets it, so it's natural that it should go to whoever gets the most use out of it.
---
If I'm in a dungeon with randoms I've never seen before, sorry but even if you get more use out of that item than I do, it's doing nothing for me. Sure, I might be considerate and would pass on it in your favor if it's a small upgrade for me, but you shouldn't be expecting everyone to do it all the time.

Guild Master of Pornhub is the greatest title to ever be earned in Classic.
---
Doesn't work because it's my pet's cast.
---
The unfortunate reality of the game.  Loads of people are cheating just some are less blatant than others.
---
Alliance or horde ?
---
&gt; dozens of layers per realm
---
There are dozens of us, DOZENS!
---
I mean you have one pal waiting near bank haha
---
Names would be great for a 9 y/o tho
---
Someone got wiped recently
---
Pickpocketing was the sole reason I could _easily_ afford all skills and my mount when reaching 40 back in vanilla. Except for my warlock (which obviously doesn't count), I never achieved that on any other vanilla character.
---
Thankful for a place to share my journey
---
For me it was mostly with caster dps. Everyone i tried felt like spamming one or two spells and waiting for procs. And the biggest negative aspect is, every class can do nearly everything. There is no unique solution where you need a specific class. It felt good to know for example druids bring battle rezz and innervate, and nobody else.
---
LFG tool. You click the role you are performing, and are expected to only take gear with the one stat for that role. And people are fucking stupid.
---
Mograine EU PvP is around ~48/52 in horde's favour, but as even as it gets on a PvP server.
---
I am a human warrior so i would like to go for a Sword if possible. I am not quite sure how much the Pluss to swords means to humans but....
---
Oki, Im stupid; I just got home and checked the addons that I use and I remember that Details wasn't working as it should; what I've been using is  **ClassicThreatMeter.** You can install it with the twitch app. Sorry for misleading you guys.
---
Scarlet monastery/ desolate/ arathi high lands are the best areas. STV is fun but all the mobs are quest mobs so it’s hard to generate exp
---
I work a 9-5 and was able to kill rag in this  group. Level up faster you slowturtleboy
---
This existed back then too. I remember the deserter tower in the marsh, couldn't do a quest there because the mobs respawned too quickly.
---
You really think shareholders corrupted the path of WoW? 🤡
---
Yeah sure, all these phone screenshot still look good enough to see the content.
---
I think some people just don't like to see the "laziness" of what it took to post the picture.
---
I ask because i'll start playing in less then a month and wanted to know how fast i have to lvl for to be preped for the next phase. At least by lvl.
---
Last night after around 7hours and 30 minutes as you can see in the second screenshot I manage not to farm SM on AOE for leveling which is not in the classic spirit at all. I did the old school pick pocket of gold for my mount! And I am so proud and happy about it!
---
what a great episode too
---
What does that even mean. Speak English Alexensual follower.
---
Oh thats nice. Thanks.
---
Again checks out.
---
Previous evening there was also a cute attempt of about dozen mostly sub 30 hordes to hold the Goldshire inn's roof on ZT server. They actually held it for quite a while because they could just ress anyone from the top when they died and even low level damage was enough to stop most people before they managed to climb to them. Me and my level 49 friend however realized that we can turn off our PvP flags in 5 minutes, and in 5 more minutes we climbed the Inn unmolested. We had some fun dancing with our guests and after few minutes we decided to shut their party down. Good attempt though!
---
Their DPS drops off. But PvP isn't about DPS in raid settings. Hunters still wreck with their survivability and burst DMG.
---
Which isn’t even true but hey, you do you.
---
Is classic?
---
Yes there are some chinese people doing something like botting/gold farming which started in china and is the biggest in china which makes it a chinese thing. Same as pizza is an italian thing am i racist for saying that too ?
---
It won't be destroyed forever but we have a problem when people run around with 300 devilsaur leather.
---
Its not like they are totally the same but Pala and Warri Tank have nearly the same moveset just with different namens and animations.
---
I played healer for the most Time and for me every heal specc has nearly the same spell heal spells , some Mana regain etc. so it’s no difference if I play a Preist or a druid healer.
---
I would like them to keep the servers classic then give us the option to port over to either classic plus or tbc. I would prefer classic plus tbh it would be good to experience something new but with the classic talents and feeling,

Excellent retort bud, don’t even know who that is, enjoy retail :).

How long did it take and what exactly did you sell?

I am leveling as healer, but I still need strength gear to hit stuff with a sword between instances.

Well apparently this particular knock knock joke dates to way before undertale.
---
WHYYYY DO YOU CALLLLL?!
---
Until you run into a tank that thinks he can pull half the dungeon with only one warlock in party. And then blames you for not downranking your heals when you got zero bonus healing on gear.
---
I'm so out of the loop with all that VR stuff. I think the transition to being old is happening.
---
why should they do this? What are you hiding?
---
You're barely losing HP when using a shield because the dps gets all the aggro ;)

How do you even managed to turn your pc on and log onto reddit when you're are this stupid?

All loot you get while leveling below 50 is pretty much completely meaningless. I don't mind if somebody rolls need on an off-spec item. That said, out of courtesy, I still ask before I roll.
---
Ohh that sucks friend :/ hope you can get a new machine any time soon
---
Yesterday I was ganking the level 25 dwarf priest as a 22 druid. I was like "hell, I'll do it, a lot of horde around here anyway". So I proceed, he runs away past 5 or 6 horde players around level 23 while I chase after him. They just didn't give a shit. One mage stopped and casts frostbolt and then just runs away. So of course I don't get him because he cc's me away everytime he got close to 0 HP. 
---
Made me furious. In the meantime they all get ganked by level ?? alliance players in Mirkfallon lake.
---
I've never been more furious. Why roll on a pvp server if you're not gonna participate.
---
&gt;Chinese people doing chinese things.

Did they change this recently? last I played BFA - at least M+, you can’t summon another player with the opposite war mode toggle option to an instance.

I don't know about your server but mine got a subreddit and a discord. I guess it would be the best bet to look there for stuff like that.

Or the official realm forum could be useful for events like this too
---
I played an ally lock day one vanilla on a pvp server.  It was horrible trying to quest.
---
I rolled on a pve server in classic and I really am not regretting it
---
well, it's the same in classic to be fair, but i see your point about some classes bringing a unique thing

Anyone know the numbers in Razorgore?

Well ya when your only vanilla experience was nostalrius your perception of what a healthy server is becomes skewed.

Since I'm still in the barrens and everything is over-farmed...maybe not yet.

On the beach in the far left the quests are lower level (around 24) than the quests at Splintertree Post (around 27) so they would be easier, my brother and I had to do that when we first arrived then came back for the Splintertree quests after a few levels
---
I'll agree on the fact the community hasn't changed.  I was going to do an escort quest and invited someone to my group to do it with.  Only one person at a time.  Instead of joining he just grabbed the quest and left and said have fun waiting 20 minutes.
---
Yea balance is a shit spec. Upvoted++

This fits so well I wouldn't be surprise if the original poster was really talking about wow.

I see :) Because of the typo in post title I thought it said "priest's buff"
---
kinda wanna take a break from lvling my 34 mage and make a rogue and pick up skinning or somthing so i can fund my mount money and level a rogue(my 2nd choice of class to play after mage) good idea or no?
---
Not the answer to the question, but the order is not general for all classes(I assume you're a mage?). For warlocks it's spellpower &gt; spirit &gt; intellect/stamina for example
---
I also stream on twitch so my group is pretty active
---
Thx, could delete your account on the way out and never come back
---
&gt; Is this a problem?
---
It's much easier if you find a warrior that wants someone to healbot them around, I'll say that. The grind will be longer otherwise, but with one of them you'll rarely die.
---
It's annoying, and I generally tend to not play with these guilds.
---
The folder in your directory is literally _retail_
---
Fitting name.
---
I love to walk around and if I see someone struggling I will give a shitton of water and food, feels good.
---
Farming 1k gold until now would've been possible without any layering. Layering is still needed unless you want a 12k queue on all servers with 4k online playing at a time suddenly.
---
Pro tip:-  Pass on ***all*** loot rolls except for stuff you can use right now on your current character, and make money from cash drops and white/grey item sales.  As a level 16 tanking warrior, I currently have over 90 silver, and I have been using this strategy.
---
I learned to do this when maining as a Hunter in the old days, because I wanted to get away from the reputation of Hunters as ninjas.  However, with a tank, it's ironically even more viable, because I've actually had other players ***tell me*** to Need gear that was going to improve my tanking.
---
Don't be greedy.  Not only will you still get everything that you really need, but other players will like you more, which means that they will be more likely to want to give you gear, rather than you needing to compete with them for it.
---
boo
---
Yes. Level as shadow, except for wand specialization, then respec at 40 to get shadowform. You will still be able to heal dungeons all the way to 60. This is my resource for all priest talents and knowledge, I would suggest checking out his stream too if you have any more questions. https://youtu.be/VOe2YT-4iRQ
---
Maybe RP-PVP.
---
Bow of Searing Arrows is amazing, especially PVP wise, if you can get your hands on it.
---
I'm thinking about the same thing. My shaman is elemental/resto, I only play him with a friend.
---
Once I'm 60 he'll never be fit to farm gold through killing mobs. So I'm leveling a hunter with skinning and mining to be the character I see the world with.
---
Wand Specialization + Spirit Tap is HIGHLY recommended for leveling. As it greatly increases damage and uptime while leveling.
---
You do in no way need to be holy for dungeons while lvling. You can even heal dungeons as non-holy at 60.
---
Mostly farming mobs and the different styles. Mages AoE, hunters chain with no downtime, warlocks 2-3 group. But as mentioned above, sometimes you play a Rogue who doesn't really excel in combat like that, but pickpockets for a lot of extra gold. I'm sure every class has something that people have found, whether it's a priest being able to mass tank mobs and heal it, or perhaps combining 2, as you said, to outpace everyone else solo.

Must be a French thing.

AH has greater reach, but many people would much rather have a guaranteed buyer who wants regular shipments of say 300 Thorium or something. Trying to sell that on the AH to maximize profit is just annoying. I for one would rather be able to dump it all to one person who is then okay spending hours in front of the AH himself.
---
we dont know

Wow wow wow hold it right there, I have just as much right to be here as you. Better cool it a notch

Anyone knows stats for Venoxis pls? Ty

OMG ty for this tip
---
Idk layering has been a complete non issue for me so far. I keep running into the same people and I have never been unintentionally yeeted into another layer. 
---
Have i abused the layer system a couple times? Yeah. I dodged someone killing the quest npc in a protected area so that I can turn in the quest instead of suffering. Did I sometimes change the layer because a quest mob is overfarmed? Also yes. But every time I did that it hasn't helped me in any way. They're overfarmed in the next layer as well.
---
Overall I'm pretty happy with how things are right now.
---
36, just got level 3 Blizzard, and I think I have zero spellpower gear because I'm focused on AoEing, so it should be easy enough to replicate.
---
Damn, thanks for the info, I definitely need to switch then. I've been using a separate addon for the dungeon icons, and I already use leatrix plus so I know the author is reliable. Not sure why I'm being downvoted though.

Congratulations on the mount! Any tips for a warrior? I’m not very stealthy and my mail gear makes a lot of noise!

How good is blessed recovery? Has anyone tested it? If I see anyone use it at all it's to make dispelling you more difficult and mana consuming, but I don't see anyone using it for anything else. I was thinking that if I did pvp my build would look like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusAbZfxtIc0o), focusing entirely on instant casts and survivability since I'm going to be public enemy #1 in every pvp battle and getting a cast off is going to be difficult regardless. Imp mana burn seems essential, and I would consider taking points out of imp renew and holy spec to put points into divine spirit and another into martyrdom to get something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAboZrLtIc0o) but I'm not sure atm.
---
Because i still have lvl 12 robe at lvl 25 because feral druid decided that he needs the robe of arrugal for when he is healing altough im leveling heavy disc +spirit tap untill lvl 40 where i have not yet decided if we will go more on dungeon spam as a core party of warr tank, me and lock or will i respec to shadow
---
Gang gang, no queues are the best.
---
Rofl! This is Epic and makes sense too!
---
Yeah I tried the discord and waiting for a response. The subreddit is practically dead with only 33 members.
---
For some reason the official forum won’t let me post without a level 10 character. I’ve sent them a support request to help fix it, I think it may be due to me not have one in retail?
---
I’ve also been mainly going for Holy spec. I did however take Spirit Tap and Wand Specialization. After those, I cranked Holy, Holy damage will be almost the same as Shadow until Shadowform is unlocked in terms of questing and leveling. Healing dungeons is absolutely fine as Shadow spec.
---
I like to banish elementals or demons, usually stay for a few min to recast :) not to be nice, but to deny Alliance players to farm them. The glory of normal servers.
---
The wave is somewhere around 40-45 right now. Once the wave reaches 60 layering could just be turned off.
---
What is your server type and guild name if you don't mind me asking?
---
Hunters can solo farm Maraudon for consistent gold.
---
Where do you have that information? All watlocks guide ive seen puts spirit last.
---
Shadowbolt cast time while questing is my problem with using it as an opener.  I've lost so many quest mobs to others who attack my target while SB is casting.   
---
A quick tag with CoA (or Corruption if talented) is much faster.
---
Everyone knows that 92 is halfway
---
You are referencing theories and conjecture, that is hardly a stronger argument.
---
Fact is that before the storm is the only canon material on the subject and the fact that the chronicles were published just goes to show that the lore earlier in the game was spotty and not clearly thought out.
---
You're free to imagine whatever you'd like, but that is not the canon lore. It's just an alternate timeline theory.

If reddit tells you today to jump off the 30floor building because your dps will be better, will you do it? Ridiculous.
---
Ah dude I got that quest yesterday. It was bad enough when I was sent across the ocean, but the part that sent me stumbling around Ashenvale, trying to sneak between mobs 5-8 levels above me, that was some bullshit lol. Killed two alliance though, so there’s that.
---
And my bow
---
Looks like that one isn't available on Curse, only WoWInterface: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25095-SimpleMap.html
---
I mean... Isn't it exploitative of a game mechanic?
---
Blizzard banned or downrolled characters for less in the past.
---
I agree but if you plan ahead you will still have flash powder in your bags while you wait.
---
Probably not for free. They may open up paid server transfers some day though.
---
They are cosmetic pets that are available to the Alliance. They can be sold to Horde players over the neutral AH.
---
\&gt; We’ve been monitoring players’ use of layers, and we agree that we should add a delay between subsequent layer transfers. Under the hood we have all the controls I talked about in the Reddit AMA before launch, a few secret weapons we haven’t discussed publicly, and we’re working on deploying some additional controls to further restrain layering from being exploitable.
---
Yep, whats even more about replaceable part is that im  priest , and we are running in core groupe of warr and lock. Not only we will replace you , but we will also summon someone else
---
Beats spamming frostbolt over and over
---
And I just entered barrens on my hunter, and he came out of nowhere 2 levels higher than me couldn't tame him :p
---
If i had one id be doing the same thing friend.
---
That will not work. As a warrior i need 90% leather for my bis prerais gear.
---
Now this is epic.
---
Oh yeah that's a French expression, 24 hours out of 24 hours. Means all the time.
---
I was all for layering but like I said in mid/late game it’s not necessary.  Not sure what level you are but there will be times on my full server with a 5k queue that I won’t see people for ages.  Yea stv is packed but places like badlands and feralas were dead for huge periods of time
---
Focus on mage most optimal but I'd you're bored and the grind is wearing play something new. You will have a good time
---
That's my issue.
---
 You have more or less balanced realms post phase 2 with around 3k active players and suddenly most leave for BC (worst case scenario, but seeing this reddit this should still be a sizeable amount), crippling servers and community.
---
Only way to deal with that would be imo massive transferts and server restructuration, both of which aren't really "in the spirit of Vanilla".
---
No way to please everyone, everything done post naxx will fracture the classic playerbase.

There is a tram station, yes. The problem is with Darnassus that you can only reach by running through a level 30+ area to get to the boat harbor. It's like if they put Org zeppelin towers in the middle of Ashenvale instead.

Poggers, someone from CN buying gold and breaking ToS. Color me shocked.

It won't be the end of the world if you get your mount at 42.

You call it "working", warlock? :D
---
I honestly wish that IF would be our main hub again on retail. Such a shame devs just don't care enough about us the players or even the game itself to make it happen. Being stuck with SW is really starting to tick me off.
---
&gt; priests are extremely efficient levelers
---
You got to be kidding
---
A hunter solo cant do anything in DME. Warrior+healer can take down a few bosses and farm 2-4 rich thorium veins every save.
---
Ahh Oki so that’s the number. Yea I guess it’s not anything dramatic. I see what I can find but I also like how those big two hander swords looks like. But I guess the best thing to do is using the weapon with highest dmg at any time.
---
Healers usually have high dps wands and can hit a lot while not healing. Don’t worry too much about it, that’s what mages are for
---
Yes, 30 vs 34.
---
WHAT CAN I DO FER YE?
---
I hope to look forward.
---
I want Blizz to really analyze Classic, see why so many people are hooked on it, and to (re)implement them into retail somehow. Based on posts I've seen here, it boils down to community and for people to share interactions with each other again.
---
I like the idea of "hardcore/social" retail servers. No LFD. No Flying (or harder to obtain). No cross-realm interaction. 
---
Have content designed so that players NEED other players. So maybe no heirlooms or BoA items that will blast you through content. 
---
I know it's beating a dead horse, but it's so obvious what's killing wow right now and I'm just venting.
---
A blue level 20 belt can easily last you into your 30s depending on luck and stats. It's a few levels but that is a lot in classic. I'm not obsessing over items, but they make a big difference.
---
I often make groups while looking for 1 item and make sure no else needs it so there is no competition :) often takes longer to make the group but its worth it for me.
---
I did the same thing, level 9 now. Have a lot of work to catch up to friends tho. Good luck!
---
Similar situation minus the alcohol, having a blast with my old friends from 15 years ago. Reliving the grind and the dungeons, being the highest level of the group and helping them along feels good after I get home from work.
---
Downvoted for being right. I have tested and confirmed this guy is correct.
---
I know but its coming eventually
---
Geared hunter, fresh 60 hunter - what state does the hunter need to be in?
---
Sell yourself as a tank or heal for strat live orb runs?
---
Honestly it's always been at the very back of my mind just lingering since a kid
---
In Desolace, damage causes you.
---
I just got the crimson red one like less than an hour into the grind because coming from OSRS i thought a pet would be cool.  Everyone keeps saying to sell and theyre crazy rare.  Any idea what they might end up being worth with more gold in the economy?
---
Congrats! Enjoy him! I tamed him back in Wrath when I started, and he’s still the only pet I use today in retail. I have my own black cat irl, so of course I had to tame him :)
---
People literally made YouTube videos with tutorials and guides telling people to be prepared to commit to their appearance.

Only profession I have is skinning
---
For sure, play how you wanna play. For me, it was a conscious decision. Wanted a taste of vanilla, but not a mouth full.
---
Layering doesn't affect queues, at all.
---
You absolutely need an int/spirit set to heal as feral druid, ret pala, or enh shaman.
---
Caster hybrids can easily use their normal sets, but a full agi/str setup isn't going to cut it past level 30 or so.
---
I've done this exact thing.
---
Layering doesn't affect queues.
---
This post is very confusing, and quite possibly in the wrong sub.
---
Also that's a paladin.
---
Farm beasts in STV preferably cats 37+ they drop grey item that stack to 5 and sells to vendor for very good silver if you have skinning that + heavy leathers sell in AH very fast, other option is to go normal route do your questing and have your mount at 42-43. Thanks and GL man!
---
Rex Kwon do!
---
I think dungeon grinding is a good way to make gold indeed.
---
And if it can make you feel better, I didn't get my mount before being 49.
---
I read all quest text and pick all the herbs. I dunno what I like the most about it, the immersion it gives me, or the fury that comes over discord from my impatient guildmates.
---
You make some real art :0
---
Looks insane what you draw :)
---
At first I thought kromcrush was heavily horde dominated but when I got to stv I saw so many horde getting merked by alliance
---
Gotta remember this is corporate speak tho. I don’t doubt that it’s true, but peak hours will obviously be higher than regular hours, and I wonder how many are present then.
---
If you're going to equip it, then need away.
---
Totally worth it - I also live with my Lady and have a time and energy consuming Job (Automotive Development Engineer) so there is 1,5 - 2 hrs time per day to level but I totally love it! Just can recommend trying - so far you will not be disappointed!
---
Nice dk
---
Most people have common sense, their just too selfish to apply it and want everything for them selves.
---
what do you mean DK? it is showing a paladin?
---
also i know how you feel. I stopped playing after cata because i had no time; Graduate school, full time job, wife, baby.
---
but it is important to have a little time to yourself. I only play 1-2 nights per week for 2-3 hours each time. If it means that much to you it is possible to get back into it.

Back in vanilla a LOT of people leveled past 40 without having the gold to instantly buy the mount. And don't worry, once you get to 60 you won't have the gold to buy the epic version for a very long time either.
---
Layering is interesting to say the least. Was trying to get the rare cat the rake on my hunter. Went out and he literally had just been killed. While I was standing their one of my friends came online and invited me to group. My layer switched and boom he was up. I did knot know that much about layer till that happened. Oh, the possibilities.
---
When they remove layering they will decrease the server cap as well.
---
Ahhh, it feels good to be Horde.
---
I don't understand why there hasn't been a salvage option prior to BFA lol
---
Don't self pity yourself, we are not perfect, nobody.
---
What would be the difference between a bat and an owl? Or did you mean in general both are underrated?
---
That doesn't mean that layering affects queues.

This guild is on my server Zandalar Tribe
---
Idk if you're trolling or just a bit slow.
---
I think “modern” and “classic” would be better descriptions of the games at this point. Classic is retail now because it’s for sale. I think the term retail was only relevant in the private server days when people weren’t paying for the game.
---
Or normal mobs were overturned on pservers?
---
Not at all my experience. Been playing feral for the first time as a longtime warrior player and it's been so much better. One single Maul will keep a mob on me for ages because of its stupid 200% threat modifier, and if it crits I can just ignore that mob for the rest of the fight. Just mark a skull and give that one a big ol' whack before tabbing over to the others.
---
At this point i wanna cheer to Hunter named "Tickles" who dId tickle me all the way from Taurajo to silithid eggs quest zone. Dont member the name but it was on Mograine, cheers mate!
---
I'm neither. Layering as a mechanic has no bearing on server size or queues
---
It's not announced yet, but I'd guess you'll have plenty of time if you're a regular player.
---
Indeed, just reusing the other guys formulation in this example.
---
One would think a "silky smooth" hunter pet tanking run was with a spider pet though?
---
I wenta step beyond and dumped wife so I can play undisturbed
---
Add a proof and submit a bug report.
---
is there an addon/command to remove the quest objective tracker that appears on the right side of the screen? i want it gone so my guide can go there!!!
---
pala i mean i have hunter too
---
Great work. Really looking forward to make a decision on staying or skipping town.
---
Hopefully you meet some nice folks out in the world, I know banding together with randos has helped me out immensely
---
You know as much as anyone else
---
Claw or Bite or both for a cat pet (for leveling). And why. Thanks.
---
yeah just was a miss click i have a hunter too
---
Unfortunately it is, regardless of layering.
---
What you are completely forgetting is the game has already been played years ago. The majority of people at 60 are private server players who have already played the game multiple times and know all the tips and tricks. 
---
We already know that the x1000 black lotus or arcane crystals is false (confirmed by blizzard in a post). 
---
The people who are 60 are literally playing 16+ hours a day. The majority of Apes are getting their epic mounts now because they have been spam farming dungeons for days.
---
Find your wow install location, go into the interface folder, and put the elvuid folders into the addon folder.
---
I don't think this is true in the super populated realms we have now. It doesn't take long to find even on the lfg channel. The \who is really a hit and miss and requires alot of whispering and keeping track of who you whispered etc.
---
Thanks. This is an amazing feature which I had no idea existed.
---
Whirlwind axe is special case
---
Love playing on grobbulus. 
---
The other day I ran with a guild called wild hammer clan or something.

They were exclusively dwarves and I felt honored to run with them being the only human.

Which phase will add the STV fishing event?

No hate for streamers here. Only hate for all the butt licking fanboys.

With layering server cap is around 15k
---
Without layering it will be around 5k
---
If you can't realize how it affects queues...

But did he bite your imps’ ear off?

Gaijin recently removed the Taiwanese flag from their vehicles in their most recent effort to suck China’s dick. Their player base spends more money than most with games like these so yeah, good luck getting anyone to do anything about it without requiring mass protests.

Got in back in highschool when it was 14$ a share :) mmmmmmmm

I think this is the right answer. I plan on going 5/5 wand spec, 5/5 spirit tap, then taking damage-focused holy talents until level 40. At that point I'll switch over to shadow until 60. If I find that I'm not doing much more damage with shadowform, I'm just going to switch back to holy/disc.
---
Peak wow?
---
yeah its paladin just was misswriting   
---
i was playing with 3 class ( pala dk hunter )
---
Hobbs way of pulling :) lol
---
Or it could be classic + with just new content at 60 and no BC, who knows.  I think everyone should get a survey down the line and allow the players to vote on what they want.
---
Post-meme?
---
What is this
---
hahahaha
---
Very fair comment, especially considering mine was a little rude. I get what you're saying, and of course your ui is clean indeed, but for me, any of these bars/graphics/viewport art take away from the minimalistic feeling as it's something that'll always be visible in my peripheral vision. I don't necessarily even mind it, but in a minimalistic ui I want just THAT. Minimalism. To each their own, of course, and I still commend you on your ui as I like it and could very well use it, even!
---
Your argument makes no sense.
---
Mage only needs to click and learn a spell, then trade.
---
Warlocks need to get a soulstone from a mob.
---
Not sure if druids need a reagant for bres, bit same shit you can het it at ah for a low price. And the point of it is to ressurect your teammates.
---
Now lockpicking, you need to skill that up like a proffession. Completely different.
---
In doing it now and apart from the godawful Satyr horn quest that took me an hour and a half I’ve loved it. Even had some world PVP encounters on a PVE server and more tense moments when you almost fight someone but don’t
---
because of the punchable face? or is it the receding hairline?
---
Burning Crusade Classic will only happen if Blizzard likes money... wait...
---
People are kidding themselves if they don't think TBC is coming (and likely WOTLK).
---
I just hope it's a case of copying characters rather than converting servers.
---
yeah i have upload the right pic just was a missclick
---
Oh cool so she’s got a fat ass
---
SO i'm not familiar with hunters.Will that still be a useful pet in later levels?
---
That sounds handy actually! Thanks!
---
personally i would say that the most sense would be to keep classic servers as they are currently. not adding further expansions.
---
if they were to add further expansions, force players to "migrate" else the playerbase would be too split-up.
---
what i would wish?
---
regular full re-releases of expansions, wipe the servers, char data etc. let everyone start fresh but with the next expansion unlocked.
---
gives a fair playing ground for everyone etc.
---
maybe let ppl. transfer their characters to retail if they want.
---
RFK for corpsemaker and SM armory for the herod shoulders are like the only times i do the limiting. and in the case of SM armory i normally run it like 4-5 times so i might get it the first time and then i make runs so a hunter or shaman is ensured to get it.
---
Duh...a shadow priest is already a caster. You already have gear with int and spirit on it.
---
Feral druid, Ret pally, and Enh shamans don't have int/spirit on their dps gear.
---
Perfect time to level up your cooking by grinding low level mobs for meat.
---
It does. Without layering, they will have to decrease the overall population size (for now) because most of the people are still in lower zones.
---
I agree with this 100%.  
---
If you're expecting to need on gear outside your role as a healer or tank, then are you ok with the dps rolling on gear outside their role as dps (namely, YOUR healing or tanking gear)?  You can't have a double standard where you can get all the loot but other people are limited only to some.
---
Yeah, but this was mostly consequential. Since many guilds struggled keeping a stable raid of 40 people together, you would always have many people in the raid who were new to the fight or raiding in general and didn't really know what to do.
---
Yes, I rolled Alliance for the first time after playing exclusively Horde since BC. (Reasoning being that Alliance has Pallies, which I usually play. I have a Human Mage atm tho.) I like it, i've never played Alliance before so levelling is really fun because the zones/cities are all new to me.
---
This is the true way to play classic, EVERYONE ARGUING ABOUT HOW THE BEST WAY TO PLAY!!!!
---
even though the knowledge base for min/max is there, everybody still knows better and argues about what is best. This is how classic tasted back in the day and its the best. Ignore everything and shout your way is best, that is the classic experience
---
Sounds like you could enjoy warlock. But you really shouldn’t play for the damage but for the fun
---
I'm a level 52 shaman but I can't seem to pick up the quest ''Elemental mastery''. I've read all the entries on the quest I've found but I can't seem to come up with an explanation of why I can't pick it up. Anyone having the same problem?
---
Locked chests belong to rogues and blacksmiths unless they feel like sharing
---
I'd probably ask the group before the run starts. Most of the time you greed on mats, and need on recipes. Most groups won't care if you ask.
---
Right. But by today's standard you'd never wipe to Geddon even with 40 new people. 
---
Garr maybe if you got 8 Warlocks who were all idiots
---
Start on the left mate, as a fellow WOW noob I made the same mistake as you and got my ass kicked by everything. If your at least level 22 or so start on the coast to the left at Zoram Strand, that’s more your speed. I’d say you have to be level 27 or so to do stuff on the right. 
---
The only thing I’d say is pick up the quest in the right side of the zone along the road for the shredder manual pages as you can get them off any mob and it’s helpful to collect some while your questing on the left.
---
1) Loot. So much silk cloth, greens and silver dropped from mobs. 2) Mounts don't matter when you're in a dungeon. 3) Side effect is leveling quickly which if he's farming an instance anyway, why not get the best XP for doing so? Certainly going to get more xp, better loot and more gold from a higher level dungeon..
---
I'm level 43 on my warrior now, it was fairly awful from about 25-36
---
but since then, whirlwind axe (now bonebiter) + sweeping strikes and a whirlwind does a lot of burst cleave
---
I feel like you want to be doing quests that are a couple levels lower than you, to let you take advantage of the cleave you can do
---
i joined the first guild, where the g master didn't auto invited me ... since then my problem with that is gone xD
---
This sounds right. In addition, I believe stacking int will help you level it faster.
---
its been proven false by blizzard anyway. So OP is wrong
---
The only other 2h dps classes have other roles that they could use to shorten their own queues, why should I detriment my own levelling experience because they only want to dps at all times?
---
I'm lucky and have a great guild so queuing isn't an issue for me anyway but the same goes for where I would be in as a dps, I'd still be expecting the tank to need on those items because they do need them in the 20mins or so after we've finished the dungeons.
---
Which ones, may you member?
---
*Stormwind theme intensifies*
---
Exactly. Was doing herbalism in Mulgore (had to catch up) snd passed a lvl 8 druid. Gave him my mage bugf and 40/40 food/water, without him asking.
---
Just whispered him: vanilla feels, just pay it forward :)
---
Love this game. Kindness can spread just as fast as hatred.
---
mmhmm, missclick. That's a paddlin'
---
Too early to tell, but im almost sure we will get the other expansions as well. In 3 or 4 years.
---
 This small Addon replaces the golden dragon with the winged silver one  for Rare-Elite mobs. It does this by checking the targets's  classification (normal/rare/elite/rare-elite) each time a new target has  been acquired and replaces the unit frame if it encounters a  Rare-Elite. 
---
[Silver Rare Elites](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/silver-rare-elites)
---
The servers are already starting to hit high latency points at peak hours, layering has absolutely nothing to do with player count. The reason layering is there is so once the servers start to average out of the players that are only here for the hype they can remove layers keeping the same feeling amount of players in each zone.   
---
Even if the server capacity was not a problem and they were to add more layers like you want that would remove the entire point of classic, being the community aspect where people meet other people in the world and make a relationship (good or bad) with them.
---
You're that ninja
---
wotlC
---
Different strokes eh? :)
---
It doesn't mean it affects queues. If Blizz switched off all layers except the first one right now then the only possible interaction it would have with queue times would be sorting out the mess of everyone getting DC'd and trying to reconnect, but that would be login issues and not server pop cap issues as pop cap is not related to layering mechanically
---
I would absolutely love it if they added new content and kept the level cap at 60. Add a couple new dungeons and raids would be sweet
---
yeah you right . i switch to league of legends then fortnite but for now i stop playing games ( just 1 game on phone ) life after
---
I have had so much to do so i havent been able to level from 35 for the past 3 days
---
But i dont mind because i can run SM(my favourite dungeon).
---
Lol number 5 is definetly danish.
---
It means Fatdog
---
Try to evolve into getting keybinds! qertfgvc, shift1234, alt1234, ctrl1234 then shift/alt/ctrl qertfgvc.
---
Change strafe to A and D, dont need "normal" turning.
---
I have auctionator and questie.  Useful things.
---
I just didn't realise that ElvUI was done.  I guess I assumed it was more complex or something. ;)
---
I'll probably get it downloaded when I get in.
---
LOL
---
Is there any point in me using Serpent Sting now I have unlocked Scorpid Sting on my hunter? I have both on my hotbar but only seem to be using Scorpid.
---
I love that! Got a "Totally Normal Buckler" a few weeks ago. It's a shield model. But it's a main-hand weapon. So you can pretty much dualwield shields!
---
I'm running rogue this time and barely pickpocket anything, is it something I should do before I kill a mob or should I go to certain places and spam pickpocket on certain mobs
---
That's the hunter for me too! just me, my pet, and a log full of quests... it feels so comfy. And when I get bored questing I go fishing, and make nice home cooked meals for my character and her pet. It just all feels so good, it all *fits.*
---
&gt; 4-5 day old judgement
---
That post is barely a day old
---
&gt; Im not an idiot...
---
I never implied such. ALL other bags are called "bag".. searching for "silk bag" is only a natural thing to do, heck, I did so myself until I looked it up properly.
---
Stop being so edgy and reading everything negatively ffs...
---
If you say so lol...  there are multiple reasons to “cry” about it but your right homie I’m clueless 👍
---
32.33 repeating of course...
---
I keep my pinkie on shift and ctrl for modifiers.
---
awesome video
---
Spirit is vastly underrated for levelling, but it is almost useless in raiding.
---
I'm surprised nobody has commented about the fact that you need a bag add-on
---
Why not challenges that everybody can be in ?
---
Something stupid like, inverting the starting areas with the endlevel areas ?  so you start at silithus and co and end the leveling at elwyn forest and teldrassil
---
No! Azeroth is flat. Wake up sheeple!
---
thats the point where you either shutdown the servers for classic or fully go through the whole timeline again.
---
blizz needs to be careful to not split the playerbase too much.
---
Don't ask your Voidwalker anything, he's not your friend, he's your employee (at best).
---
Ok thank you I can understand this :)
---
It would affect server cap for now because most of the people still in lower zones. That’s the whole purpose of layering during phase 1 only
---
When population is more spread out, remove layering won’t affect server cap.
---
Did you even read his comment? He was commenting on the culture as a whole not just the gaming industry of China. Be that as it may, you still can’t generalise an entire countries gaming culture as ‘scummy’ just because it is more prevalent than your own.
---
Not going to get into an online scuff with anyone just don’t like bigotry.
---
Im everything i dreamed of becoming, but im still not happy... what is wrong with me?
---
Best way is find a bugged mob that evades or just bug it out yourself and afk while attacking it.   Or you can just not concern yourself about it and eventually it will max out with just playing the game.
---
and now ? Open your  eyes O.o
---
I dont agree that they are the best but they are definetly viable in dungeon content
---
Thanks, mate!
---
U keep classic and just add new content which stays true to classic formula and to pass on the content it needs a 75% player vote percentage to pass
---
I love the turn a corner and stop ... lol
---
But I’m the one complaining... got it.
---
Nah, played enough WoW back in the days and had my fair share of experience with assholes (ninjalooters). And who cares about what they know, they can fuck right off, acting like they play at the highest level not realizing that the only difference between them and most casuals is that they spend an absurd amount of time to get to the same point as those casuals. 
---
Ninja loot -&gt; get the boot
---
And if they get salty, we are gonna collectively laugh about those neckbeards.
---
A rogue wants spirit?
---
don‘t think it‘s possible to show the real hp unless you use „Real Mob Health“.
---
not sure how it will work with other unit frame addons tbh
---
Old Azeroth? TRUE Azeroth!
---
You might be right, but the concept of Arenas themselves are fine. Having 2v2/3v3/5v5 battlegrounds makes for quite fun PvP, the problem is how the rewards worked, how the formulas for balanced pvp were changed (Resilience, I'm looking at you!) and a need for there to even BE balanced PvP at all.
---
That plus flying mounts were a terrible blow to PvP.
---
What exactly do you work with?
---
For raiding at 60 I'd definitely recommend a wolf. Pets have a tendency to get murdered horribly by raid bosses, so having one that helps you even when it's not attacking is a nice little bonus. I named mine Johnny.
---
But the advantage of Broken Tooth isn't as big as people state (also there are other 1.0 atk. speed pets coming out with ZG). With Claw, casters will have lots of pushbag regardless. I'd honestly probably go for a Wind Serpent over it. The ranged damage is pretty sweet, plus it penetrates armor.
---
when you come out of the mage tower in SW you can run off and hit the tree as you jump down so that you don't take any damage and don't need to use blink / slow fall / etc
---
*GUN*
---
Looted this one twice within 24hours :\^)
---
Its pretty sad how many people are using the word "unfair" to describe this awful layering system. Like, how helpless are you...
---
For me the glory of slaying hundreds of alliance dogs is worth 100x more than some points in an interface menu.
---

---
As a lock my passerby buffs upgrade from waterbreathing to detect invisibility
---
Lol don't.  I spend 40 hours in the office every week and another 35-50 working from home after I leave.  At least when I had a shitty retail management job my work day actually ended.
---
OnTopReplica lets you do this with any window.
---
Np ^^
---
I mean that out of 2 items with the same stats, one cloth and one plate, The best one would clearly be the plate for the paladin as it has more armor and paladin class is built to have more armor.
---
I don't think those quests are available until a later phase.
---
Arent the raids scaled to the number of people in retail?
---
Check out montabon on twitch, he’s doing just that
---
Don't die.
---
Horde when they outnumber you.
---
When they don't its /wave all over you.
---
do you live on the East coast of the US? maybe blizzard is telling you something
---
&gt; Play on a pve server might help more.
---
Somehow it's always a rogue main saying stuff like this. But be asured, that same main bolts out the moment he/she gets clapped.
---
Maybe those 2h classes feel there's no use in signing up as a tank since they won't be able to need on their coveted DPS gear in that case, due to etiquette and politeness? I think our opinions differ too much on this point to see eye to eye, this type of double standard is something I'd definitely kick people for. 
---
Here's to hoping we won't end up in the same group!
---
I for sure want one of the cats for farming and stealth.
---
Goddammit. i thought I would be a speed demon and didn't need to save up for a tiger.
---
jokes on me, I had all that time I used it to do stuff for my friends, and they all rerolled when I took a few day break...
---
Oce Arugal? I reckon i saw you out in tarren mill the other day
---
Just so you know, bagon evolves into shelgon at lvl 30
---
No thanks I will continue to play the game the way I want, Nice try tho
---
Because people dont have any gold, if you cant sell it at higher prices because no one wants to spend that much the price will go down.
---
you can see it in the mail that contains your the money too I believe
---
but it makes no sense to remove layers and dont decrease the cap. shure you could crank 15k in on layer... you could even do 150k. BUT WHY? lulz
---
I just hope all my new friends in game don't transfer
---
Every pala ever: Bring it!
---
Sure, but Nostalrius will always be known as the "one" that made it all happen.
---
Gamers are specialists at making  mountains out of   molehills. WoW Players are unparalleled at this craft. 
---
But I have to admit, I love to read the outrage and farm the salt :)
---
Which is why layering needs to be removed and honor system enabled right fucking now, to give more incentive.
---
That doesn't mean that layering affects the pop cap though does it?
---
I remember I suggested the idea of a voting/survey system about a year ago for classic and got flamed for it. Apparently it would allow for trolls to "abuse" the system. Seems to work ok for OSRS
---
You know that Illumination is a talent on Classic version, which refunds 100% of mana for a crit heal :P
---
I'd be happy to go up to wotlk, I'd like there to be no flying though.
---
https://willitclassic.com/view/iYBJ6qJBOUUxc3kRxLj5
---
And I guess there are more somewhere
---
Nope, I've come up with a system for this kind of thing.
---
If  I need 10(shells in this case) and I kill 10 mobs, and get &lt;2 I drop the quest.  I don't have time for this crap lol....  I'll be missing some so-so cooking recipes, and obviously there are some exceptions.  By and large this has resulted in a more fun experience for me....
---
It's probably better to confirm it first with everyone. Some people might get salty they can't sell it on AH for just above vendor price
---
Can someone ELI5 how Spellpower/Healpower works with Renew and Flashheal?
---
Its funny cause they are short
---
What addons are you running? Looks very nice.
---
If you want to solo and heal in dungeons, you need everything. It's a problem.
---
Felhunter is in general way stronger because it can eat every buff even pala bubble and ice block. 
---

Rolled female Dwarf Priest for 10 levels and couldn't stand it and then switched to Night Elf priest. Am I truly ruining my experience with my game by doing so or should I give up on the priest class all together and stick with my gnome mage so I stick with the proper race/class combo meta that this game's community needs? I'm a little worried to play what I enjoy only to get to the end and told I'm not needed.  
---
I feel bad that something so critical to the class is something that bothers me so much. I thought I would get over it but that waddle walk as a female dwarf kills me.  I want to play what I feel attached to.
---
Thanks for all the help and advice people, nice to know I've got some great information to refer to now and knowing most of my gold is going to be coming in the 30s, I feel much better 🙌🏻

Do not, DO NOT transfer to the new server. Queues WILL disappear eventually and you’ll end up with a very healthy server that has a strong sense of community.

These new servers will forever rot in the Low-Medium range. Just be patient, it will be worth it.

&gt; So that's 5 different keys I have to tap at the right time to cast optimally over and over on every encounter. 
---
yeah god forbid you have to actually play the videogame
---
I actually haven't heard that before, but it makes a lot of sense. 
---
I think the point I'm really trying to make is that there Classic represents a chance to make a different choice. If the only way to support more content is Classic without invalidating old content is to change fundamental game mechanics, then maybe try that this time?
---
Waste for what? If it isnt any good he wouldnt get any value from selling it then
---
I love this subreddit
---
maybe not from a technical point of view. but if you want an enjoyable player-experience, then it does
---
I never knew that was the whole quote, makes me feel better now. 
---
Thanks!
---
using your swing timer you can kite mobs to reduce damage taken. just move in as your timer is ending.
---
if you go slam spec you can also fit slams inbetween your melee swings.
---
having the enemy swing timer is also quite helpful, whilst running from mobs (warrior does a lot!) you can 180 jump as they hit to avoid being dazed (you only get dazed when hit from behind)
---
With the weapon swing timer addon, you will really be able to make use of the hamstring kite method. With this you will be able to trade blow for blow with any mob by initiating combat, followed by rend and then hamstring to kite the mob away, until your weapon swing timer tells you to stand still again to get the next auto attack off.

[There are a bunch of cats with 1.2 atk speed, then] (https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php), maybe they can tide you over until Broken Tooth? :)
---
How do you improve your isp functionality? Im getting horrible latency problems
---
How the hell do i turn this piece of shit on
---
I tolerate clickers if they have less than a 1 year of WoW experience.
---
Don't trust what you see in the media
---
Minor correction, the lyric is "Eat shit".
---
Yea alliance is instant 100g
---
There's going to come a point where *something* has to happen. First, I think they should avoid doing that for as long as possible. Then, I would prefer to see new content in the spirit of 'classic' WoW instead of just revisiting the past expansions. 
---
I truly loved TBC, but I would take new content that is designed to be as 'vanilla-like' as possible over it. 
---
One idea that I think is interesting is keeping a variety of servers open at different levels of the game. Some classic, some TBC, some WotLK, but who knows how feasible that would actually be for Blizzard.
---
Still looking for an addon that hides the experience bar. Preferably one that does almost nothing else so as to not fuck with my UI. MoveAnything doesn't work in classic, Shadowed Unit Frames doesn't work, Personal Experience Bar either, and Bartender messes everything up.
---
If we do get additional expansions, they should be separate servers. i.e Wow Classic, Wow Classic TBC, WOTLK, etc...
---
If they overwrite Classic with TBC, Classic will be gone forever.
---
The was there when I ran by to Rachet for the first time.
---
Made a nice piece of Light Leather
---
Sry I can't read portugese
---
It's just more difficult. The last boss especially is no cakewalk. 
---
It is a significant step up in difficulty compared to any other dungeon up until that point.
---
Items sell for more. I got a polearm that sold for more than 5g yesterday :)
---
I’m just curious about the mana bar in bear form. Please tell me the name of the addon.
---
Your screenshot just convinced me that it’s time for me to upgrade from my potato.
---
I believe it became harder to manage as everybody kept gaining levels. Imagine trying to come up with fresh and new ideas for lvl 120 for 9 classes (10 nowadays? I don't know) while keeping things balanced, diverse and fun. I'm not really on the hurrdurr Blizzard made a stupid bandwagon, it seems like it is just too much to manage for the state that retail is in currently.
---
And my dagger
---
It's true they are. They don't kill fast but they have little downtime which makes up for it.

No it doesn't, youre being disingenuous now.
---
1. Depends on your gear and the tank's. Don't expect to be able to heal a crappy, undergeared tank as shadow. But a good tank in good gear? In vanilla I had some groups where vampiric embrace was enough to keep the tank up (with the occasional shield) and we had effectively 4 dps. That's the dream.
---
2. If you're levelling solo, you want mage stats: stam and int. If you're levelling healing in groups, you want int and spirit.
---
Even the quests for theese mobs are marked as elite. Just did the Dustwallow Marsh dragonkin quests, the quest was marked as elite, but the dragons were non elites, and it was soloable.
---
Wouldn't want to leave evidence on company computer
---
An alliance castle in Mulgore? What the fuck? Do you perhaps mean Durotar? Mulgore only has a bunch of angry dwarfs if I remember correctly.
---
There arent as many layers as people think there are. Blizzard put put a blue post stating that there are a single digits number of layers and hinted that it's a lot single digit. I'm guessing there are only 4 layers max at ant given time. And every layer I've tried to hop to has been packed either way.
---
It's because Vana'diel is the name of the world in Final Fantasy XI

---
And I'm a Democrat.
---
Just wait until classic tbc, my frenemy.
---
It’s fine. The only person who really needs a fear ward is the main tank and they have other ways to negate fears. It’s better to play a character you connect with. Also shadowmeld is great for a priest.
---
WE are your family NAO. *unsheathes knife*
---
I call this the Camberwell Carrot...
---
I’m on a PVE server so they have to be more creative when they try to kill me or get me to flag. As a Mage my rotation includes frost nova but not with Horde around!
---
The funniest is when I see someone chaining mobs toward me trying to kill me and they die instead. Has happened at least three times now—I would love to know if there’s something in the code that doesn’t automatically have them turn on someone of the opposite faction just for being nearby. Because that works when it’s MY faction!
---
It's still pretty minor.
---
what didn't you like about the dwarf priest? they are a lot better
---
The same shot can happen with BoP. I can ask out to a vendor and get some gold for it so I'm going to roll need.
---
Which Video? Link it, thanks
---
Chinese player breaking ToS of a game

*surprised pikatchu*
---
Same as alliance tbh. People behave similarly no matter what faction they are in.
---
Since I', of hoarding type - I could play without addons only to level ~10.  
---
Managing bags past this is a hell for me. And then SexyMap make mini-map so sexy. And auto-sell junk save my time. And seeing vendoring prices of items help you to decide what to keep and what to destroy)
---
Clearly you're incapable of reading. 
---
The bottom of the post I linked they literally state. 
---
"Every server has single digit layers, and most servers have LOW single digit layers."
---
Please stop spreading lies. That post doesn't say anything about increased layers, just increased server capacity. 
---
They're 100% removing layers.
---
HELL YEAH
---
*pseudo (sorry)

It's actually not too hard....just got an through the targets to see the house. I, personally don't like the look of the nameplates.

You're welcome ❤️

I play with a g600 (https://www.logitechg.com/es-roam/products/gaming-mice/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse.html) but there are cheap similar versions on Amazon (https://www.amazon.es/Titanwolf-frecuencia-iluminaci%C3%B3n-configurable-tecnolog%C3%ADa/dp/B07GB8T64N/ref=sr_1_13?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=raton+mmo&amp;qid=1567767558&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-13 spanish Amazon)
---
The idea is then, to use the bartender addon that lets you put the bars in different format.
---
For example, I have two bars (24 slots) in a 3columnx4row format that resembles the buttons on the mouse. One is just the buttons, the other one is alt + the buttons.
---
This makes it very easy to access 24 spells and specially in retail is easier if you place the stun in the same place for the different classes that you play that have stun for example.
---
LOL you got me with this one
---
SWEAT
---
On the way look for Shadumbra and Ursangeous, a black panther and a greyish white bear, killing them gives a quest each for some quick xp too
---
yeah same, hit 35 just now and feel like LFG chat is only spammed with ppl looking for cath,ulda,zf :o
---
That all you could come up with? ‘Simple Jack’
---
Well done
---
It's funny, everyone around me warned me for this game and I was very addicted no question about it. But it kind of resolved itself really. I found a girl, I found good paid work with awesome working conditions, i am living in a big  house with no financial stress and the funny thing is... I never let go of WoW like everyone told me to do.
---
Its not ready UI pack its selfmade. Main are:
---
Luna UnitFrames
---
Bartender
---
SexyMap
---
Details!
---
!BattleFont
---
Mapster
---
Prat
---
But I can sell BoP to a vendor for gold which I need. Why would it be any different?
---
Nice! Have a cookie... Fetch!
---
At least asmongold plays, hand holded and carried into space, but plays.
---
i don't get enough time to play as well, and on the first day after work i've spent 4 hours in que, could only play for 2 hours WHICH i've spent setting my keybinds.. i tried to make them as convenient as possible, but didn't manage to do it, although I did use quer and shift 1234. you probably noticed that i tend to avoid buttons which are a bit further, just can't get used to it.. but this is actually a good suggestion, going to try it out and get used to it today myself, will see how it goes, thanks.
---
&gt;So post the beginning of memedom
---
So.. am I the beginning of a new era? Is this the NEW Enlightenment? May the history books note that I am a drunk, single dude in Brooklyn... but I did great things ahead of my time.
---
It is not about wow. It is about it stuff. RegEx is sort of expression that can be used to check if some string (or substring of string) matches some pattern
---
It's almost as if horde and alliance characters are all played by human beings.
---
Google it, it’s not a WoW thing.
---
Danke!
---
Single digit layers? There are 25K+ auctions on Herod. Atleast 50K+ active players logging in on a daily basis. You're telling me there are 9 layers? That puts the realm cap near 30K. How the fk are you gonna shove 30k players into one realm without layering? The log in queues during phase 2 are going to be disgusting.
---
This is the answer.
---
omg Thank you so much ive went though 10 different addons and had the one that fixed it the whole time lol
---
Ashenvale is the equivalent of Duskwood, not Westfall.
---
Incendius gang!
---
I'll agree there is going to be no good recreation that captures it like it was, but we can try to get it as close to possible. I don't see it currently being better for everyone, someone has to farm the items and given a price war those people lose. There is a reason that botters are bad news for game economies, it throws everything off and makes certain professions essentially useless.
---
I'll join in, too! The replies above were all negative, and I think we need to balance it out a little. I'm unemployed at the moment, but I know the right phone call will come - in the meantime, I get to grind Classic WoW. Life is good.
---
I managed to get all 16 satyr horns in Ashenvale today!

---
Bro MC got cleared first week with a lot of the raid not even 60. You don’t need to be a dwarf priest
---
&gt; I must admit, if this makes it harder to find groups it's gonna suck. I'd rather just get rid of layering alltoghther than be like "sorry bro can't run the dungeon with you I just did a quest with a random so my switch layer timer is on a 15 minute cooldown"
---
Waiting 15 minutes for the people to arrive at the dungeon is hardly unheard of in Classic. I'd say it's actually the norm. So I really don't see that as a problem.
---
bro 😎💪
---
Not enough cheese, says uncle Sheo.
---
Well, we are in a ideal world so we can dream all we want..
---
I keep forgetting this is a streaming sub reddit.
---
Yup!  We reserved names on Herod, and then got to talking...... "We're all old now(40's its an owned label on my part)....."  "I don't want to be spending the 2 hours I have to farm running away from some derp with an axe to grind...."  
---
Yep.... Best choice for me....  I will be PvPing a plenty once honor is unlocked, and BG's are back.  Until then I need that MONEY!!!
---
6sfk runs i think are enough

Sorry I assume people have common sense to figure out the small detail of don’t attack mobs that can kill you and void what the OP asked.    Can’t level weapon skill in ghost form.
---
I can't speak for Priest specific Addons but the general ones I use are:
---
* Bagon (UI to show all bag slots in one pane)
---
* AtlasLoot (Tool for viewing dungeon loot)
---
* Titan Bar (Stat bar for top of screen - Shows Gold, Time Played, Durability, XP per hour etc...)
---
* Skada Damage Meter - Show how much damage you or your group is doing
---
* Simple Maps - Smaller Map Window
---
* SexyMaps - Nice Minimap UI/Skins
---
* Immersion - UI that changes how NPC interactions look. This is quite controversial as it changes the Classic look. I don't mind it personally. I play Classic for it's mechanics, not for the UI nostalgia.
---
* Auctioneer - Adds extra panes to the Auction House, making it easier to buy and sell items. Makes searching easier.
---
* Vendor - Show rough vendor price of items in your bag
---
Get a mage  druid and paladin to buff you, intellect increases weapons skill rate
---
To get from Org to Thunder Bluff requires walking through the southern barrens, which is a lvl 20-ish area. But much easier to avoid than the mobs around menethil
---
Unbind the S-key. It serves no function.
---
I will be going after Dives draintanking guide once I hit dark pact... I am gunning for it already, but only lv35 makes it so that its not a 100% optimal as I dont have dark pact yet, my drain life is not doing enough…
---
Did you watch literally any video on how to do it?
---
First aid for Alliance though. Worse.
---
He posted on Reddit yesterday, lemme find the link
---
What addon for the nameplates?
---
Meh. It really doesn't.
---
Account sharing isnt against the TOA since wrath my man, unless they released classic TOA somehow lol
---
This is what makes the game so special. I saw another Druid when on the Zepplin to UC who was a level or two lower than me but using absolutely trash gear. I said “your gear is trash, follow me to the thread vendor and I’ll suit you up” to which he of course agreed.
---
We ran over to the LW area and I threw 4 pieces of gear together for him on the spot and watched him equip them. The guy was thrilled and offered some cash in exchange which I declined.
---
Be the change you want to see in Azeroth.
---
As Alliance I always used to go the deeprun tram and hit rats. They are instant respawn and there's 4-6 in a cluster, so just infinite click and hit for skill without having to run around.
---
Although I cant remember if it's SW or IF side or both.
---
Well when you find a better one?
---
32.33% of course minus 50 dkp,
---
NGL that’s when I run back just enough to get them to think I’m pissed and then play an alt. The idea that the guy is waiting for me to show back up and I’m not even there makes me happy.
---
You could go by the fucking definition of exploit if you want?
---
&gt; make full use of and derive benefit from (a resource).

"500 companies sprang up to exploit this new technology"

"platinum was originally exploited by the Indians of Colombia and Ecuador"
---
Give it time. Reputations take a while to build. Use your friend and ignore lists, and just play. Good people will be known as such and shitty people will be not invited to groups.
---
Could you save a talent point if you take the pet that procs it more often?
---
Hope your doggo gets better soon
---
That's my realm lol
---
It hurt itself in confusion.
---
My diagnosis is that you are in denial about the strong feelings of guilt youre having about how long youve been sitting in front of your computer.
---
I agree, I would not like to group with you while levelling - although I think we'd get along great at max :)
---
As my closing thoughts;
---
Etiquette is what is customary and I think it's accepted that rolling outside of role when you're levelling is the norm. 
---
I see a dungeon run as a collective how can we all get something out of this and when you're levelling that certainly isn't going to be role only items.
---
Unless you're levelling only in a group/dungeons farm what would you stand to gain from tanking or healing if you can only roll on role? 
---
Regardless, I do hope your groups are what you're looking for and you have a great classic journey.
---
When you find or make a better piece of gear.
---
Last paragraph - he hates the waddle.  I'm the same way.  Rolled a human priest.  Dwarves are so ugly to me that I wouldn't enjoy the game if I played one.  And if horde can do everything without fear ward then alliance can too.
---
Nah you can only slay them if you're an admin
---
..the speed-runners who have been playing vanilla for the past few years on private realms won't get surprised that 'phases are too far away'.
---
There must be more than one because I saw this on Incendius as well
---
The R stands for role play - people will get in character
---
She is roughly 50, my mom played back heavily back in the early vanilla days so she remembers all this stuff. Back then she just let me sit at her computer and fish for her, so now I get to experience the real thing. :)
---
Did you have to put points in improved stealth in subtlety tree?
---
If it makes up for it then priests would be the first to hit 60. Fact is, they are not.
---
Who'd have know that being famous would have downsides :)
---
Revive not in vanilla
---
I mean rag raiding spec is arcane power then go frost so you aren’t wrong
---
Ah ok. I don't know much about IT or coding stuff. Thanks for explaining :)
---
So... This means I can't use prat to block the requests for layer invites? That sucks :(
---
Yes, I've come to this conclusion too after more intense googling.  It was bothering me on a personal level as it seemed to be quite different behavior from what I remembered back then.  But then again, I suppose the community back then also didn't have a plethora of databases at their fingertips knowing full well already all the drops available, and how this cloth and that were their best shot at good stats.
---
Did you know if you pass 100 tabs on Chrome mobile, the tab count icon just changes to ":D" since there's no room to display a 3 digit number there? Don't ask me how I know...
---
15 years of number crunching and testing and you're questioning which spec is better??? Really?
---
I use Dominos.
---
My advice is this: when you find a better one.
---
I thought I read in the release notes that sitting will cause crits but will not proc abilities. That's probably why you can't reliably reckoning bomb. In vanilla this mechanic was fixed prior to 1.12.
---
Drain Tank, multi dot is better with you are running a duo, drain tank is optimal for solo
---
Also one step of the Linken questline from un'goro.
---
My guild is here
---
Raided Naxx on my 3G network like 5-7 years ago on a pserver for a week or so, barely took any data at all. Albeit I played on a PC using hotspot.
---
sounds like a guaranteed raid invite to me :D
---
I'm at 25 right now and unfortunately you kinda need most spells...
---
What I skipped thus far:
---
Rank 2 of Resurrection (the goal for now is to be able to resurrect, next ranks only increase the amount of HP and Mana your targets resurrect with, so not nearly as crucial)
---
Mind Vision - it's a gimmick, and nothing more.
---
I do this with Diablo 3.  During long runs or flight paths I bang out a rift.
---
It's A B C for regular loot, but quest drops are independent of that.
---
While I agree with you horde has WOTF and tremor totem
---
Hahah you’re you’re tripping dude! Only 90 silver at lvl 16? Doesn’t seem like your plan is working. Tbh random pugs aren’t gonna give a shit, or reward you for not greeding items that obviously nobody  needs. That’s why the entire system exists. I wouldn’t recommend your strategy to anyone who is interested in having enough gold to by a mount at 40.  Js
---
I don’t even have a d
---
Omg.... I can't be that stupid. It never clicked what that meant.
---
Because the new system is better. You get more choices. There was usually just one, maybe two "right" specs to play. Now you can swap around talents for all sorts of situations.
---
No alliance equivalent?
---
That's what i thought too.
---
Stop it.
---
BoEs are under Everquest cash drop rules. If it’s valuable, I’m rolling need idgaf if it’s an upgrade. It isn’t fair to miss out on rolling on something like Staff or Jordan because I happen to be a rogue. Same thing if my insane item drops idc if everybody rolls need
---
so that when you arent holding the mouse down you can still strafe, though I'd just use Q&amp;E since I like to turn with keyboard if I'm otherwise occupied with the cursor healing with Clique.
---
What? I saw that news on dozens of sites. Legits sites. I started classic due to that. Is it really fake? I told everyone about that and multiole friends started it for that reason. Wtf.
---
Ruining games and leaving both are essentially not punished by Riot's current system. If you repeatedly leave games, I believe you have to wait 30 minutes before your next game. I don't know of anyone recently, or seen anyone recently on subreddits, including streamers/high ranked players who intentionally tried to get banned, who got banned for AFKing or inting games. 
---
Saying a single bad word on the other hand, OR simply typing too much (either one can trigger the system, as Riot's support system will happily explain) will get you instantly punished. The first offense gives you a 10 game chat restriction and drops you down to Honor level 1. At that point you can't compete in team competitive gameplay (Clash), you no longer get in-game rewards (Hextech Keys) and you don't get Ranked rewards at the end of the season for the rank you rightfully earned. A second offense drops you down to Honor level 0 and gives you a 25 game chat restriction. From Honor level 0, it takes literal months and hundreds of games to get back to honor level 1, much less 2, and a single other game that triggers the system can instantly erase any progress you've made. 
---
So no, they definitely don't care whether or not you ruin the game experience. But if you do decide to intentionally troll, just be nice about it and you'll be fine.
---
Except asmongold doesn’t buy gold with IRL money or have others log onto his account to level for him.
---
If you like having mobs hit you in the back, yes.
---
Spicy
---
pikachu is japanese
---
It’s the same specs people were running in vanilla.
---
Sometimes questie would mess up for me. Type /reload and see if the quest still is there
---
1. Leveled 4 priests in vanilla/TBC and you can heal dungeons as shadow without much problems if you and the tank know what you're doing
---
2. Spirit&gt;int&gt;stamina while leveling to not have any downtimes at all. Mana/sec&gt;int when healing @ 60. Int/stamina at 60 for pvp.
---
3. Almost all of em are ok, except for a competent SL lock with a felhunter, who is unbeatable pretty much.. Mages/pallies are the easiest probably. The rest is ok and skill dependant.
---
4. 2 many 2 write :) Just watch some guides/streams of good spriests.
---
Yea this is the right anwser I think. I played on a server with classic and after BGs got released the price went up to 50s each sometimes
---
Well, i better not show you where the lemonade is made, sweet lemonade!
---
Why? 
---
Genuinely curious. I’m a total noob at this game.
---
Do a few SM lib and armory runs with a good group and you will get a level or two which will turn those orange quests yellow and give you a bit more edge in zones your level if you are on pvp.
---
That's easy to say in a reddit comment, but look at talents for example, you get your first one at level 10, and you're still using them when you're full T3, it has to scale and work for every point in between.
---
Vanilla wow was *full* on raid content. The mechanics of the game cannot support any more raid tiers. If they want to add extra stuff to do, they have to come up with another avenue, interestingly this is the strategy they went for later. In TBC they made PvP an entirely different "path", they added a Timed raid with ZA for extra "stuff to do", and tried to lean a bit more on solo play with daily quests, as well as Heroic dungeons.
---
This then got more and more into this by adding achievements in Wrath, then different dungeon raid difficulties, going Ham on dailies... Perhaps you see where this is going?
---
When you ask the game mechanics to change to support additional content, you're effectively asking for retail, because the game design of wow evolved in response to players asking for more, more, more, just like you are now.
---
Perhaps we can all just enjoy Wow classic for what it is? Enjoy the 6 phases, and if it gets old, you can move onto TBC or just accept that it's over. Even so, that's probably several years from now.
---
Also as an amendment to my first comment: I've also been reminded by a friend that Naxx gives players in the instance a debuff that reduces their crit, just an example of how they had to take measures to actually make the content a challenge.
---
So this is correct? 
---
(7 days a week \* (24h-7hours of sleep a night )) - 2 \* 40 full time job + full time school = 38 hours of free time per week. Then add to that commute which i assume is a non trivial amount of time given that you need to transport yourself both to and from work and school.
---
I smell bullshit.
---
&gt; And lose his job money? Please.
---
The rest of us also has a job and still manage to play WoW in our free time.
---
If you're playing such a game as a famous character with you name known then that obviously has a downside. Who would have knew that being famous results in stalkers!
---
Yesterday, I helped a gnome mage by sheeping him because he had really low health. After he had full health I hit him with a staff to get him free. He immediately blinked away and came back with 3 friends and killed me with /spit.
---
Now I feel the old fraction hate again and will everyone I encounter.
---
this image made we watch 300 again tonight
---
You forgot the all important "DU-NU-NU-NANANA" in-between each of those phrases
---
Exactly. This game is all about communication and collaboration, people!

i ... i havent touched the auction house yet :(

Thanks for the advice!

Dwarf priests are best, but the best isnt required at all times.

---
no since some mobs will still fan behind you and you miss out on dodge/parry, re-position with a slight back pedal gets the whole pull infront of you without having to rotate.
---
I did this the other night, explained in short why dvts are a bad thing and that walking around a few minutes every hour or so will prevent them.
---
I actually read this wrong. I thought you said bind A to D lol. I rebound A &amp; D to strafe on retail but tbh, I found that if my right hand is otherwise occupied, I cant turn my character which can be a little frustrating.
---
And now the secret is out...
---
Oh yeah that's true, but it's just a breadcrumb from Orgrimmar so I thought they'd probably done it
---
What did you expect though?
---
China is pretty hard against cheating as well. They have jailed a couple of cheaters and developers of cheats.
---
Only if you don't turn the mob around before fearing. Mobs run in the opposite direction they are facing so by turning the mobs around you can kinda control which way they run.
---
Paladins are a way better option for heal with large tanking abilities. Priests are a great class, but overall, it's a fuckin pain to get a paladin down in Warsong or Arathi, hence giving a large advantage to have other players elsewhere.
---
maybe they weren't here in 2004. they consider classic to be a retail expansion instead of vanilla.
---
Cool! Thanks mate
---
Lol all that drama for no real reason.
---
Isnt it anoying how you can aleays see your nose
---
I'm envious of you. I tried to get this set but it never drops.
---
League is owned by tencent though. So it should be in your ballpark then.
---
Isn't he supposed to be like an extreme stretch of the definition of anti-hero? 
---
I think I remember one of the artists or someone commenting saying punisher is supposed to be what real neutrality looks like or some shit
---
They are not ‘a lot’ better. They are better from a min/maxing perspective but by no means will it ruin anyone’s experience of the game to play a different race.
---
In short: you can see it as different "layers" on a server (realm) where people are placed.  
---
This is done to spread the huge amount of players on a server.  
---
So your friend can be on one layer and you on the other. You can't see each other, only when you create a party, one of you will be placed on the same layer. Each layer has also his own gameobjects (npc's, mining veins, mobs, etc).
---
After a few weeks, Bizzard will disable layering. No exact time is given, only that it won't be months.
---
And yet they can be rogues
---
Because people want the real feeling of danger, the true experience, I don't tend to engage the faction as there is nothing to be gained and time to be lost but it would be stupid not to have the option
---
I'm not on a PVP server but I've been tempted if realm transfer becomes a thing just for shadowmeld + mind control. 
---
But thank you for the update. I was trying to compare when it is needed and the raid is super important for sure, but a lot of extra requirement for that one moment. Again I was more concerned from a community perspective because even if it isn't needed, if the community tells you it wouldn't want you around without being dwarf, then I would have gotten worried.
---
Haven't played WOW in years and I'm used to remembering a lot of little things make a huge difference with the players and how they treat you.
---
Nope. I'm always up for a chat and I'm actually looking for a guild but I will outright decline any rando invites.
---
Hmm yeah not my type :P
---
Fortnite is dead you bot
---
Probably, but we're sending ppl to Zoram Strand first so they might do that out of order.
---
I woke up 2 hours early today so I can do some questing before work
---
I remember when i first started playing back in 2005 i was very curious about the world and was eager to explore it, to find friends, to hang out and party together, was all about helping each other and stuff, but when i played it after re-release i realized that i've become a toxic piece of shit, i tend to steal people's chests, ores, herbs, i try to roll as many things as i can, i steal quest mobs and etc, just doing basically everything to get the most out of the game (in the matter of resources and leveling), i dont feel like im having too much fun playing it right now, so i just quit recently after reaching level 14, i do not wish to play anymore yet, i did not like the way i changed. What a shame it is to realize this. Fuck.
---
33 leveling priest here
---
Which is better at sustaining mana during leveling/dungeons, mp5 or spirit? Is it better to use +3mp5 or +4 spirit wrists? How do I calculate it?  
---
Also how good are items with spellpower? Is item with +x spell/healpower generally better, than item with stats?
---
Could just be a manner of speaking, to run someone out is just to chase away.
---
I had a level 22 hunter ask for another hunters help in trade chat. Offered some help. It was about training pets, which isn't the most intuitive thing, so it's understandable. Talked about how he didn't even have enough currency to buy skills. Sent him 1 gold, a bow I bought for his level, and a pair of shoulders I made.
---
I don't even get a 'Thank You', and Ripjaw gets a goddamn reddit post.
---
Alliance has always been the PvE focused faction, nothing new here
---
You didn't even list a server for this shite.
---
[DIGGING INTENSIFIES]
---
I had a lot of fun questing with a hunter through darkshore together for about 3 hours. We even killed murkdeep at the end! Great time chatting and talking about life! He ended up out leveling me quite fast though and he is now 30 haha.
---
at early levels where your hamstring only slows for 40% its not worth the effort. It literally takes more time to get away from most mobs hit radius than the time to your next swing. Even with slow weapons. Mobs seem to hit from quite far away compared to private servers i've played.
---
Looks good, I wouldn't do arcane until your frost tree is finished. Other than that you should farm aoe with ease!
---
How is that relevant to the use of the well known meme of pikachu being shocked?
---
perfect! Thank you very much!
---
This has nothing to do with AOE grinding
---
SM armory, SM cath, STV farming for grey drops/leather/herbs, rock elemental framing for grey drops and arathi highlands farming for warrior quest charms are good options for gold at high 30s.
---
That said it might be best to just focus on levelling and grind when youre close to 100g (90g if honored) at 42,43. 5gher level = more gp/hr always.
---
He's right.
---
As long as you aren't using A and D to turn, you're okay.
---
Everything is cheap right now cause of influx, as many get max level and need more things and less people lower levels everything will go up in price and supply will be less and demand will go up, right now there is an influx in supply with low demand.
---
All those guides are wrong lmao.
---
You just whisper 10 at a time and wait. You can track them easily via seperate lfg panel where you only see channel 3 and whisper. My experience is that its still useful on high servers.
---
My experience with /3 is that you only get people that are just the right lvl and usually only get classes that arent good for loot destribution.
---
Its worldwide aka global aka on every server
---
People catastrophizing things on social media? Never!
---
well yeah, there's no such thing as "thorium" crystals.
---
There's a reason higher level players kill lowbies, and that's because they can't play against players their level. So I'm gonna go doubt on this one.
---
&gt; Title, I'd like to tank but I'm being told Paladin can't really tank at all
---
Paladins can tank raids, but its all a matter of how much effort you put into it to make it work. I don't suggest it for new new players to wow classic though.
---
lvl 10 in stv?
---
First I've heard of this rule, I'll have to start enforcing it in my runs
---
Happy cake day!
---
Delete the evidence!!
---
Thanks for the downvotes. What are they for?
---
I'm not misunderstanding you - I just disagree.   
---
If I'm doing the group a favour by healing or tanking the dungeon, I don't wanna be at a disadvantage in terms of my chances of getting gear for leveling. I'll of course always make my intentions clear to a group, and might in some cases be okay with only rolling on healing gear, but in most scenarios healing gear would mean very little to me, whereas (in this case feral) leveling gear would mean a lot. 
---
In fact, the reason I found this discussion relevant is that I'm not sure whether I think it's okay that I as a feral druid, despite healing, roll on caster gear. - So we are quite the opposite in our opinions of what you roll on when leveling. As caster gear is something I only need when in an instance, and the role can be done just fine in greens with a bit of int.   
---
If the role distribution was the opposite, and healers and tanks were overflowing and struggling with finding DPS, or if tanking and healing was great for leveling, the situation would be somewhat different.   
---
Chances are I'll be tanking most instances as tanks are more in demand than healers or DPS in my experience, so there won't be much of a discussion, but I rarely run into issues either. Have leveled plenty of shamans, healed most dungeons while leveling, and people understand that I need 2H weapons because that's what's gonna speed up my leveling. 
---
AGAIN, this goes straight out the window as soon as you hit 55+ and start farming for pre-raid BIS.
---
Account sharing is only allowed if it's in the family...

---
Specing frost doesnt mean you dont level up fire and arcane spells...they deal more dmg and will fix your single target till you aoe grind
---
Need is for an item you want to equip. You can't know what item will drop from these boxes, and the chance of you actually needing it is pretty slim. You should roll greed and unlock it if the one got it asks politely.
---
Bad. They're bad.
---
I made it to 40nlast night and got dark pact. Feels Goodman
---
Gandling is fine with small ques (&lt;1h) in primetime. 
---
The server is alive and you can always find ppl dooing Quest and dungeons all 24h.
---
Why??? It's a minus 29% downgrade. :P
---
Totally having a similar problem with my g600. Its totally new and not sticking but the game will act like im holding it down way after ive stopped pressing it.
---
For the last 16 levels..
---
Charge -&gt; Rend -&gt; Heroic Strike
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEe
---
For non-caster weapons, the actual damage values are more important than stats.
---
If I want to flex all roles in dungeons as Druid while leveling should I use https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-leveling-classic-wow#druid-leveling-talents or https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-05501310501 for my talent build?
---
That’s probably not healthy...
---
&gt; No shadow isnt a meme specc and the ppl that tell you otherwise are the same ppl that still think classic raiding is hard... hell classis raiding is like 5% of the game.....max
---
agree
---
Yep. You can do something like this if you want 
---
&gt;/cast [@target,exists,help] Healing Wave; [@target,exists,harm] Lightning Bolt
---
This is basically how I am except I suck at pvp and can't seem to kill the rogues or other classes that gank me very often. So I'm planning to get them all back at 60. I just want to quest man, I'm only on this dumb PvP realm cuz I was forced. Met plenty of alliance who don't just kill me for no reason so that's nice.
---
If you only are going to do dungeons i would just go prot :)
---
does that generate aggro (since it doesn't do damage)?
---
The persons name means "shadow fuck"
---
Etiquette would be all roll greed then the rogue opens it for the winner
---
You think Price will go up and i should wait?
---
Using weakauras, there's any way i can have a bar pop and count down the timer each time i polly a target ?
---
Certain pets have different abilities which once tamed can in some circumstances be trained to other pets.  For example a nightsaber has prowl (stealth) which can be trained to other cats once you've tamed one.
---
&gt; Have been pally tank since Wrath. Didn't know pally tanks were dog shit in classic. Even though the first few times I did instances, they were not bad.
---
&gt; I am no longer getting invites as pally tanks. Do I cut my losses and roll Warrior?
---
&gt; I only play tanks. Thanks.
---
They can tank at 60 and even do raids. It just requires more attention and a good guild to pull it off. Its all a matter of how much effort you put into it to make it work. I don't suggest it for new new players to wow classic though.
---
You, you were the chosen one
---
But once they leave the dungeon they'll go back to snail grinding
---
How is that not how it works? Their goal as a company was to get publicity. The fact that you are still taking about them after they have finished their steam means that goal was accomplished.  Whoever they had actually playing lost in the race, but the company, Method, won very handedly
---
Classic = season 1 GoT 
---
BFA = season 8 GoT
---
What level are you? The only time the pulls should be hard is if a mob resists either Nova or the first blizzard tick. 
---
Make sure you are maybe 1-2 levels higher than the mobs
---
Stack as much mana as you can
---
Don't spec frost bite
---
Imp blizzard is obviously good
---
Will classic ever release tbc again, or intro new content? Or too early to tell?
---
Irgendwo habe ich die auch noch^^
---
Looks bigger than I remember... RUN!
---
Don’t worry, once the economy crashes we’ll all get to be badass raiders anyways
---
My binds are usually

Q E R T F G Z X C V
---
ctrl+shift+alt on above
---
I have 1-6 on my main action bar rest is "letters".
---
Then shift+alt+ctrl on 1 2 3 4.
---
Meaning, you have shift 1234, also ctrl 1234 so you use the same shit with different modifiers i.e shift alt ctrl etc.
---
That does work..
---
Last night I opened up the flight path to Thorium Point in the Searing Gorge as a level 17 through much mountain climbing  before Hearthstone-ing back to Ironforge.
---
It took a while and I had to run for my life a couple of times but I pulled it off without getting killed once.
---
It was very much worth it because I had **fun** doing it and that's what **games** are for.
---
Gotta get that weapon skill rate buff
---
And we get robes that last into the 50s at 31, as well as an off hand that lasts just as long, if not longer at 35, also get a trinket at 50 that lasts forever
---
No, he is absolutely serious. Now, give him 10 silver and fly away.
---
If you have a shield and 1h, you can tank at low levels. but the more you level up, the more an actual tank build will become necessary.
---
UP. VOTE.
---
Different wolf meat completion. Do again.
---
Why not? For drain tanking it's really good. Just turn off autocasts on your succubus, get first aid and u got almost unlimited resources.
---
and what was that one?
---
Lol how could basketball be boring when baseball exists
---
Translation?
---
On the website [https://wow.gamepedia.com/UI\_Scale](https://wow.gamepedia.com/UI_Scale) they say:
---
" Note that the above only works for screen resolutions up to 1200  vertical pixels (0.64 UI scale), as the setting won't go lower than  0.64. For screen resolutions above 1920x1200, you will have to use */run UIParent:SetScale(UIScale)* where UIScale is the decimal number you got out of the equation above.  Since this setting is not saved, you'll have to use an addon that  rescales the UI every time the game loads (ie. after every loading  screen). While writing such an addon is a trivial task, you can also [download one](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info16878-UIScale.html) if you can't be arsed to figure out how to write it yourself. "
---
But I am not familiar with such things, so I am not sure if it is working well.
---
Son of a bitch... here I thought the fate of the planet hung in the balance.
---
Greed and the Rogue opens it for the winner.
---
t. A Rogue
---
Yeah because you're incorrect on both. Neither is botting a Chinese thing or is Pizza an Italian thing.
---
It gets less whirring sound when i change to lower settings
---
I dunno if the stacks are induvidually timed. Say it's been 15 seconds since your first application, it drops  from 3 to 2. If so, might be a reason.  
---
Have you tried target dummies?
---
Depends on your company, really. 
---
If you have a decent sysadmin who knows his way around a good firewall, chances are he has a URL list of visited websites.
---
Then there's stuff like certain remote desktop programs creating thumbnails to preview a user's screen. Not a video, but just an image. Caught people with stuff like anime porn and playing WoW in these thumbnail images a few times when I was still working at an external MSP.
---
It's a good idea to believe that if it's happening on company premises, on a device we gave you, and through the company's WiFi, then we sysadmins know what you're doing throughout the day.
---
I've seen a lot of warriors with staffs in dungeons because it's "BiS".  Do you think it's better to go sword n board or 2h earlier on?
---
Once you've got a few points into upgrading Frostbolt there's no reason to use Fireball or Arc Mis.
---
That reminded me running through Desolace and the elite giant that patrols the whole zone comes out of nowhere and destroyed this warrior.
---
You run through early 20 mobs at best, I just finished wetlands and even dun modr is 28-30
---
I’ve been looking for this thank
---
This, this is the better option
---
If you are a level 23-26 hunter waiting to tame this beauty, be prepared. You will most definitely die if you just straight up goes for tame. Use frost trap at all cost and stay as far away as you can. If you die while trying to tame I guarantee some random runner by will kill him because “oh look! A rare”
---
This rant is not against you in general, just my thoughts on the constant hate against retail prevalent on forums and ingame.
---
I don’t play BfA anymore. But when I started classic the old ‘OH you died? WELCOME to classic!’ Or ‘Oh I am OOM, this is so much more hardcore than retail!’ got stale very quickly. 
---
Just enjoy the game on its own terms instead of stroking your pickle on how badass you are for not playing retail but the ‘cruel and unforgiving’ classic
---
If you goto UC priest trainer, you'll learn touch of weekness there. It used to be a quest line that started in Brill. I guess questie hasn't updated that yet.

Higher fishing skills = more per hour?
---
It sure beats the hell out of breaking your back. There's a constant terror with it since management actually does do next to nothing all day long, just like you've always suspected. When I landed my current job, I remember asking my boss on my 3rd week, "Hey man, is there anything for me to be working on right now? I've done everything." He says, "Is this your first office job? This is just how it is. Some weeks theres just nothing at all to do."
---
It blew my mind because in every other job I had to constantly be doing something. If I was idle a few minutes that meant I was going to get shitcanned.
---
People stop appreciating how nice it is. Or maybe their office jobs really do suck and they have to work constantly. But even still, that's better than manual labor.
---
&gt; Does he play on asian servers? Then dont worry and keep playing. 
---
In other words: "It's not relevant to me so you shouldn't care"
---
If you have a fast offhand, it hits faster, and since deadly can stack, it has more of a chance to stack since it's hitting faster.
---
The argument is rather that this is a known downside of his well paying job. After all famous people all around the world are having similar problems with stalkers. It sucks but that's what it is.
---
If the main reason is just to farm gold then stick on your mage, will make tons aoe farming mobs for cloth etc. Or doing higher level quests.
---
If you need a break from mage, play something else you enjoy :)
---
All greed. Rogues who need these won't get many group invites.  A lockbox is neutral treasure, for everybody.  Rogues can ask a fee for opening them that's perfectly fine. You worked hard for your lockpicking skill.
---
SM/Ruin is not the optimal raid build. Its the best All-Around Build. DS/Ruin would be the best Raid-Build.

I mostly follow Dive's Drain Tanking Guide:  [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229\_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view)
---
Didn't I see you in Ironforge last night (Kromcrush) ?
---
Oh right, 20+ not 30+. Still, for a low level both are skull mobs with a mile long aggro range.
---
Just cause they're spamming it for that amount doesn't mean many people are actually buying it for that amount. 10g/hr =/= $40/hr by any means. Guaranteed it's only that expensive because nobody is actually buying gold at the moment.
---
Who pays 4$ for ONE single gold coin ?!
---
I'd say level arms or fury and have a shield+ one hander in your bags to tank. That with defensive stance should do it for a few levels.
---
So it's probably a better just to spec into prot at 10 then?
---
Ye
---
NE rogue is low key the best PvP choice. Shadowmeld increases your effective stealth level and as a result opens up a talent spec that is the best PvP spec possible. I believe it was discussed in a video published by 'kargoz' on YouTube with a panel of top tier rogue players. Check it.
---
Selling kidneys on the Black Market would also give you more money then your job.  I don't recommend it though considering it is illegal.
---
You used linen cloth for first aid and crafting? You savage...
---
I play on SkullFlame which was not between original servers and i did not see single queue :) and lots of players as well.
---
How much does it usually go for at ah?
---
So you’re assuming because because he made a macro to automate his standard opening, he’s removed all those spells from his hot bar?
---
Herbalism is always the best profession, you can always focus in 420 .
---
Congrats man, can't wait for tonight.
---
I rolled a nelf priest this time, but you're right the Dwarven racial and priest specific abilities are way more useful than the night elves.
---
With one exception: Shadowmeld. Do you enjoy getting the drop on PvP enemies? Do you enjoy running from an enemy on PvP server, and baffling them when you duck behind a tree and poof, you're gone? That is the one exception to rolling a nelf priest. You can sit in Tower Point, stealthed, waiting for that rogue or feral druid ready to click the TP flag. And then it's time for shenanigans. Fear, dots! Mayhem! And then back to stealth. They'll think twice before coming back up and trying to ninja cap your tower!

Don't play on a pvp server. Problem solved.
---
I would never invest any time into private server just for the reasons you mentioned. I got a classic beta invite, but never logged on cause I dont want my progress to be wiped. It feels good to play it and it will stay good for years. I don't even care if we get the classic and that's it, there is content here for years if you really like it.  
---
I won't mind the same treatment with the burning crusade and wotlk tho, i would deffo level something there as well!
---
If you really want to go fast buy joanas guide I can't promise you'll enjoy it
---
Yeah, I noticed that too. The loot is first locked to one player, so if he doesn't even open the loot window, the others won't get that mob's loot.
---
Its only in the beginning until you get used to it. I used to be against bunnyjumping in csgo with mousewheel for years until I tried it for a few days and now its my goto.
---
As I wrote to another guy
---
I have 1-6 on my main action bar rest is "letters" meaning i dont use 7890 etc.
---
So its pretty easy to get binds close to WASD but takes time to get used to but eventually its second nature.
---
Inflation.
---
As soon as more gold is available the price will drop drastically. They probably don't even sell much at this point.
---
They should start removing layers, open new realms and open free character transfers. Only long ques will force people away from the server. And yes, on the most populated realms, more than half of the players need to move away (and a lot need to quit wow) for them to be playable by p2.
---
What's the addon giving the disenchanting price?
---
Non you can’t. You can only unequip/equip weapons
---
Honestly forgot mp5 was in vanilla at all.
---
Iirc, spirit is better than mp5 for priests. Mp5 is better for shaman. As far as the exact situation, I’m not sure but I would stick with spirit.
---
This is why i hate retail.
---
Here comes that boi
---
well, blizzard is practically stating that the majority of players aren't doing so, which shouldn't be a news. even if 1-5% did it, it's still a major problem.
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
Different pets have different stats, im not sure if theyre shown above but its mostly negligible unless you want to min/max. 
---
Somebody correct me if im mistaken but i believe any elite mob in a dungeon will have better than average stats. Like, you can get a wind serpent in the barrens pre level 20 but its so-so, but if you get one in wailing caverns its better
---
Wouldn't it be cool if this wow classic opened up a new timeline in the wow universe and we got a totally new expansion that follows the feel of vanilla?
---
Read the rules before posting.
---
Yeah that’s the wow community though, and the min maxing mindset only snowballed through expansions, and usually mainly held by *okay* players. 
---
I remember a friend of mine was an insane shadow priest but was a blood elf, and his guild always gave him shit for not have devouring plague. He ended up leaving them for the best raising guild on our server.
---
Play what you want, you’ll be fine.
---
I don't mean to be discouraging, continue the experiment. Just something to keep in mind.
---
That would be so cool! I would spin that shit all day
---
Patience.

Heroic Strike is a rage dump. Generally speaking, do not use it unless you are close to capping your rage bar. Mortal Strike should be prioritized once you have it.

&gt;o that's why I often saw horde players just casually running right into Astranaar and dying.
---
did that the other day. It's literally right on the road from barrens!
---
Check out PunkRat, he is maining a nightelf hunter. Pretty chill dude, does a lot of YouTube videos too.

Certain fights where you need to keep moving, backpedaling can give you a nice steady pace without exposing your back. Grobbulus (sp) comes to mind

Great hunter, mainly focusses on PvP afaik though.
---
This has been my experience playing as a Holly Pally so far.
---
Indeed it was!
---
Not Oceanic server though.
---
It shows Blizzard as having a 72.38% coefficient in the bottom right... Is this correct? It thought that it was only 4.125%.
---
Wow, that guild name.
---
Actually paid transfers don’t exist so that’s not an option right no either
---
You forgot the eating and bandaging between each mob as well haha.
---
Incorrect.  
---
* Cooking past 150 requires a book.  Cooking past 225 requires a quest.
---
* Fishing past 150 requires a book.  Fishing past 225 requires a quest.
---
Grounding totem does the trick in that boss :D
---
The mob must grant xp.  It cannot be low level and grey.  Also if you go into the setting of this subreddit you can add little tags to your name
---
Definitely a private server thing.
---
Top tier advice here. Hunters can do the same with wing clip
---
It's a brand new server and character creation is locked, not sure why you think it would be too bustling?
---
Get the Twitch app and read into add ons they basically hold your hand and make it way easier to level. The add on are in the Mod section of the Twitch app under WOW classic
---
https://www.wowisclassic.com Has some pretty good class guides.
---
Well I usually play Warlock but I'll let my priest friend know about this, he's going to love it.
---
So one last question because I'm trying to wrap my head around LUA syntax, why does the exist command necessary? I mean target already makes sure the cast will be casted on the target does it not??
---
That character name lol
---
Might be. Came in a few months ago. IT literacy was zero. Stuff like shared mailboxes and Teams is blowing the staff's mind. I'm still not fully done overhauling this entire system.
---
Have fun!
---

---
thanks! I’m on mobile so forgot about the sidebar, I’ll go through each link now!
---
can we have another server/class/race survey 10 days in?
---
Well you're not very smart if you waste mana on a rank 6 Earth Shock merely to interrupt.
---
You would love goldshire night elf tuesdays or fury mondays
---
I hope they do classic+ in the same way OSRS is handled with polling for content. 
---
Having said that, I would want it to be separate from the Classic servers. 
---
The issue with any alternative is the fact that they would be splitting the playerbase. 
---
But yeah, more content in the Classic spirit would be great.
---
Ah okay, it represents the faction they're playing in WoW.
---
I'm a priest leveling as a heal spec
---
Who?
---
Theres literally a quest in the barrens where you find a barrel that belongs to Chen stormstout and you bring it back to an orc brewmaster in rachet. But "haha blizzard kung fu panda out of ideas"
---
I did 35-38 at the Venture Co Geomancer's or w/e up near Nesingwary. The Shredder's have a chance of dropping a Wire Fusing which can sell on the AH for around 50s. They also drop decent cash and cloth. Only problem is that they are a quest mob, so if they are being camped you will need to venture a bit away and kill some Stranglethorn Tigers or Jungle Thunderers. At 38 you can go to the Badlands and kill Coyotes/Ridge Stalkers in the Dustbowl and make a decent amount of money/exp too. There are lots of spawns and they are levels 39-41. Im currently level 39 with around 80g and started the grinding with around 20g (and I'm not skinning, im herb/alch).
---
1) Loot. So much silk cloth, greens and silver dropped from mobs which are worth more. 2) Mounts don't matter when you're in a dungeon. 3) Side effect is leveling quickly which if he's farming an instance anyway, why not get the best XP for doing so? Certainly going to get more xp, better loot and more gold from a higher level dungeon..
---
Does blackout proc on ticks of shadow word pain?
---
Yeah I get that but OP seemed like they wanted the gold before 40 and the later dungeons would make them ding faster.
---
Rs classic? What are you talking about? That was never a thing
---
[classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live) blows if youre playing a warrior.  Expects you to kill named mobs 4-5 levels higher than you solo....waste of time.
---
If you don't have another person that can tank in your place, you should start going protection right now. Warriors are the only viable tanks in higher levels too !
---
Was listening to my wife tell a story, Humar spawned, Night Elf tames it. Fml.
---
Me at hemmingways expedition when there’s a lone horde.
---
Why 1.9?
---
Do you have a link for the Twitch app? My friend did tell me about this to help with quest locations but I can only find the Twitch streaming app? Is this the same thing lol?
---
Auctionator
---
Holy shit, woyers.
---
Check out madseasonshow, or Punkrat on youtube for great info as well...beware madseasonshow might put you to sleep with his tone but he has the best information
---
it only shows how unbeatable a rogue is... even if he was the best player in the world he would have had no chance.
---
Your rotation is mind blast, sw:p, wand, so you can skip holy fire, smite, etc. I also never got mind vision or soothe or shackle undead yet. Or shadow ward.
---
There’s a ton you can skip!
---
I'm awed by your skill to kill players 9 levels lower than you. /s Please tell me your leveling location, we're pretty close in level now. :)
---
what does this do?
---
It's specifically called a "flair" you can change it on the settings
---
This isn't working for me... the macro either auto-loots OR cheap shots... it doesn't auto-loot then cheap shot as one move. :(
---
Friends are cool but my advice is to play the game for yourself, not for them.
---
They've all been new at some point. They where all lost at some point. And they all had their *"Ahhhh, that's how it works, that's cool"* moments when discovering stuff.
---
Don't ruin those moments just to be standing next to your friends.
---
That would be maybe an hour a week for me. Not even worth playing
---
I find it toxic that you are Forced to be healer but cant roll for dps weapons you need because your role is healer.
---
This makes me much calmer, i thought i was far behind at 30. No joke either
---
Mirage Raceway is mostly good now.  Occasional small queue at peak times but I can log straight in when I get home at 4:30pm

Thanks for creating more space for us on skeram
---
Ill copy paste this to you aswell as it could help you out
---
ctrl+shift+alt on above i.e Q, ctrl Q, shift Q, alt Q as different spells.
---
note: these are mostly from arena pvp where you have target arena123, cast spell on arena123 etc so you might not need all the modifiers.
---
It's not always needed but I use it just as a basic extra, mostly in mouseover macros. So for that, if I don't have a Mouseover target, it will then cast on my actual target instead. Useful for stuff like taunting/ccing off targets without swapping target.
---
You're 100% right i will do that! I kinda like having attack on my bars but taking 1 of my top hotkeys is not worthed.
---
Yes, but in not gonna sacrafice 4 int for 200 armor.  Bis is usually not plate

You can't judge server pop in the morning, wait for prime time later in the afternoon.

Direct message me on here if interested.

Thank you! Do you have any guidance on profession? Apparently I can only pick two and one of them should make me money. Are they specific to my class?
---
The slower the better but 2.0 or 2.2 even is fine.
---
Yes, it’s EU.
---
If it was loot only for rogues, it would only drop for rogues or some other mechanic to stop non rogues getting them. They are just the class with the skills to unlock, which is entirely flavour.
---
I called the cops for animal abuse
---
Oooh, what's that addon ui kit? Looks clean and pretty!
---
Or night elves picked night elves because they wanted to play Druid... :(
---
just go all feral, and keep int/spirit gear with you. You should easily be able to heal instances with feral talents+healing gear.
---
IF and big IF the only thing you are going to do is dungeon grind or questing with a party go prot.  But just know that you are going to have a very bad time if you need to do anything by yourself.   Slapping on a 1-h and a shield as arms is 100% viable to tank anything up to the early 50s.  Beyond that too if you have good heals.
---
During prime time last night it was no longer locked. Said low.
---
I don’t know what this means
---
All greed. Like engi items or generally crafting. 
---
Treat it like a chest, you roll for it also - still you can open to level lockpicking.
---
To make your life easier, I suggest Questie, a bag addon (I use OneBag3 but occasionally need to type /reload to fix it), and a junk selling addon. There's a lot of other addons people like, but having those three are the basic QoL additions I feel are important. Curse launcher probably the easiest way to get them, but google around if you're not sure.
---
The only other tip I'd suggest is "Even if you want to be a healer or a tank, level in DPS spec until you hit mid-high 50s and start running mostly dungeons". You don't need the healing specs to do &lt;50 dungeons and the damage is nice for questing.
---
Other than those two things, have fun. Don't be afraid to google, and a website like classicdb.ch works if a quest/item is giving you trouble.
---
Got offered 150g but will hold for a month or two I think and try for 400
---
Hey I think I saw you earlier! You on Bloodsail Buccaneers??
---
lol Its probably not the right way to handle the situation but it's really annoying when I'm trying to focus on something and a big invite to 'YOUR MOM IS MY EPIC MOUNT' pops up in the middle of my screen. It's just obnoxious.
---
Golemag still have 2h from 2pm .. then it goes up to 5h whole day and back to 2h around 10pm but there isnt much or 0 queve from 1am to 1pm
---
Even if they add tbc and wrath, won't you be in the same situation of running out of content at some point?
---
Can you plz tell me how to see timers on my dots on enemies and buff timers on my party members?  Driving me crazy lol
---
Nothing comes close to Zygor, the addon itself blows everything out of the water, and they support more than just leveling down the line. Subscription based though.
---
How long will this Transfere be free?
---
So I went Night Elf because I read a fun build focusing around Starshards (really just for fun, not min/max) but I'm confused as to Arcane Spell damage gear. Can anyone explain how it would work with Starshards if at all, and if it is even worth it? Also does Arcane Spell damage carry through wands that do Arcane damage?
---
Wasn’t an instance, arathi highlands naga
---
If you want I can let a friend of mine take a look at it, he is a real expert. The best I can offer now is $2 dollar
---
What this guy said
---
Mark deleted his tweets when someone brought up the minimap was wrong in the screenshots.
---
&gt;Which is better at sustaining mana during leveling/dungeons, mp5 or spirit?
---
I've been going off the formula [listed on wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview) for this, which is
---
&gt; Mage, Priest: Spirit/4 + 12.5 \[regenerated every 2 seconds\]
---
That means that 4 spirit is 1 mp2 and 10 spirit is 1 mp5 for priests and mages. Keep in mind that this is increased by Blessing of Kings (10%) and/or human racial (5%) and in the case of priest can also contribute to spelldamage and healing with Spiritual Guidance (at 5/5, 10 spirit also contributes 2.5 spelldamage and healing).
---
So strictly for mana regeneration, mp5 items are typically stronger than spirit items.
---
&gt; Also how good are items with spellpower? Is item with +x spell/healpower generally better, than item with stats? 
---
Generally, yes. Int/Spi allow you to heal for longer but only +healing allows you to heal faster (= more HPS). It also allows you to use lower ranked spells for healing to increase your healing efficiency, thus effectively mimicking the benefits a larger manapool or better regeneration have. I suggest you familiarize yourself with the [concept of downranking](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/spell-down-ranking-classic) your spells.
---
Yes, that's how most warrior tanks do it.
---
We do. It is not per zone.
---
That dude hits so damn hard.
---
Appreciate the info, thanks again.
---
Questing, im a hunter and poeple are just too stubborn and only mage/warrior to do dungeon ckeave like the cool streamer.
---
But i should rephrase my first post, 4 days in as, 4 days played so 96hrs
---
Yeah. I know right. I checked the source before I bought it. Couldn't believe it was 900 my cost at the source (bell employee discount ). 
---
And yeah. Never know on Reddit if it's a joke or just jaded. 
---
I'm happy
---
Your comment has nothing to do with the fans tho?
---
It's in the interface for global channels.
---
It gets a decent amount of use on Fairbanks, but lots of people still use Trade, unfortunately.
---
Using guidelime + TUGs alliance leveling guide and it's realy good and free :)
---
Made a video about it : [https://youtu.be/JMwSOgGe5qM](https://youtu.be/JMwSOgGe5qM) so you can see how it looks and feels. 
---
Some quest routes are really nice!
---
As well as what the OP is using, you can buy a program called VorpX which effectively fakes VR for a bunch of regular games. It works really badly for some, but WoW is suprisingly good. Bear in mind its just basically attaching  the screen/camera to your face - regular WoW no special interactions etc. The main issue is controls, since camera movement and movement etc are intertwined in WoW.
---
Earlier on it doesn't matter what weapons you use. Most go with sword and shield to smooth out damage but if you're not holding threat then not much of a point. You can easily and reliably tank with just a 2H. The Classic warrior discord has plenty of great info.
---
https://discord.gg/\PYvKyaK

A lot of the replies here saying you “need everything” are misleading. Grab all your shadow spells, Heal, Flash Heal, Fort, IF and PW:S. Once you have Mind Flay, don’t bother upgrading Smite or Holy Fire. Don’t worry about Renew, just spam downranked Flash Heals if you need quick heals instead. I would take Mind Control if you’re on a PvP server because it’s nice to have too. That’s about it, may be missing one or two things but you certainly do not “need everything.”
---
You control the speed of the group though.
---
If they just run off while I'm drinking then good luck to them
---
I just spammed SM arm/cath. Lots of silk, BoE’s, and exp.
---
I watch him a lot :D unfortunately streams mostly when I sleep :/
---
Guys whats the best profession combo for a PvP mage? I know but engi but what else?
---
They're based on WC2 units, not pandaria.
---
A bit of a waste for them to not roll. Everyone needs gold and if I’m grouping with a rando, I’m rolling need as well.
---
I wish my niece and nephew lived closer, those kids would totally fish for me.
---
Between rogue and feral druid who should i choose ? Just want to be viable for end game content
---
Long list when you're a warlock whose computer crashes when a rogue uses sinister strike in your vicinity.
---
Right? Dude just compared selling a worthless digital currency to black market organs.
---
You probably click harder out of combat or less encline to missclic IMHO, I tried to rely on those buttons but it wasn't better than keyboard
---
This was literally me last evening... xD
---
Yeah, I get that. It all comes down to choosing your poison, I guess.
---
Sell it to the vendor for chance to summon uber C'thun
---
As warlock, you're better binding the drain macros on mousewheel, so you can save a few frames between casts without clipping. Works good with shadow bolt too, cause you lose less frames between casts spamming the weel rather than spamming a key.   
---
I usually bind petattack and petfollow macros on the side buttons of the mouse, but any pair of keys is good really.
---
I thought that was for when you enter PvP combat.
---
Questlogex
---
Does the whirring stop immediately or does it tune out?
---
For me: i have a coil/FET on my 500 Euro mainboard from ASUS, that does that. I am superannoyed by it since i have spent \~900 Euro for ultrasilent watercooling, and the coil whining/FET is the only noise i hear during gaming only.
---
Theres a ton of wow classic levelling guides on youtube. It's best to search out a specific class guide first, which can give you ideas about the best race for each class (yes it makes a big difference, in PvE as well as PvP), and help plot a course thru Azeroth that's easy, fast and profitable (mounts come at level 40 costing 90-100g). 
---
And like people have said, addons help. Get the twitch client, in the mods section classic has it's own separate file location so their is no confusion between games, if you do play BfA too. And yes there is loads to help you. Again the youtubers can help decide what's best for you, as it's a lot to go into on here.
---
I borrowed 17g from a friend and was able to repay him by the time I hit 41
---
LOL ummm... maybe... ;)
---
I tried to name my tauren warrior "bigdick" , didnt work so i named him "bigdíck" instead. Worked for 15 minutes before he was flagged for rename. Silly, I mean people are named Dick so is my tauren and hes pretty big.
---
Cotemplated naming him "Bigdiq" instead but went with "Cannedbeef" in the end.
---
Also tried to name another tauren "Mobydick", not allowed :P
---
How do you people choose a main?! I love my Tauren Shaman, But I also like my Human Rogue, and My troll warrior is hella cool. They’re all level 12 and I can’t frickin choose a main!
---
AFAIK it doesn't.
---
I fucking love that pillar of fire that shoots down from the sky.
---
I'm a little bit confused, did you get ban on the account or they just force you to rename the guild?
---
Perfect - thank you!
---
Level arms, it is the best. Go fury if you think it sounds more fun to you.
---
 You don't need to be prot to tank anything until raid content and having the ability to actually solo stuff If you need to is smart.
---
 Tactical mastery and anger management alone in arms make it incredibly good and versatile as a leveling spec.
---
Awesome thanks! I think thats what I've been seeing normally.
---
My phrasing was bad, it's 96hrs played already over the week.
---
I wouldn't mind if it got to do damage more often but jeebus. Everything on the map makes a beeline for fire nova and just merks it.
---
In the options there's an option called 'Instant Quest Text'. If you're getting tired of quest text taking forever to scroll then it's the perfect fix.
---
They aren’t bad; they’re just not as good as others. Classic embraced the hybrid, the green mage if you will. Thanks so much for your super comment tho
---
My advice is a little contrarian, because I fully acknowledge how awful the cost of respec'ing is and I would nope to do it no more than 3 times between 1-6, but: do what makes sense - there are optimized builds, but they take into account optimized play and when you're new, you might pull aggro too much and want that lower threat talent, etc. There definitely are objectively better talents, but either they will make perfect sense given the choices you have, or they won't make sense to you yet because you aren't playing in a way that makes them necessarily as good. 
---
Level shadow it will be fine.
---
I guess that's what I'm gonna do this weekend, too.
---
That's exactly how we like it!
---
RIP my realm where people will want to transfer to :(
---
I wonder if they would limit transfers if the number of transfers got so high that it could prompt a bad queue?
---
Oh. Man. We are here once again. Without the ignorance of youth.... Off to get another six pack of coke and oil and vinegar chips. Full circle indeed.

I felt the same after getting Itchy. I played Horde for 15 years- not having the white lion felt weird.
---
I may have commented on the wrong thread.
---
But i will say I’m playing a paladin and i find just old style grinding mobs or dungeons has put me at a higher level than my comrades who are playing warlocks, and rogues. Not only did i catch up to my friend that was lvl 15 when i started playing, i passed him up and am now i believe 5 levels ahead of him. And we seem to play relatively the same amount of time.

---
That draw distance is surprisingly important!
---
PServers added LoS that was not in the original vanilla WoW. LoS was wonky as fuck and you could shoot through most things in vanilla.
---
For the renew part, it takes a bit getting used to but [target=mouseover,exists][target=target,exists][target=player] is my go to for any heal, buff sort of spell. Saves a keybind/modifier for a down ranked spell.
---
As far as using 2 different spells, unsure if it will even work, but I would see it unnecessary personally
---
Ah okay.
---
Awesome art mate, loving them both! Would love to see some art based on Scarlet Monastery. I just love that place.
---
This is incorrect, the rotation is:
---
PW:S -&gt; Holy Fire -&gt; SW:P -&gt; MB -&gt; Smite -&gt; Wand
---
For green enemies that die fast, it's:
---
Holy Fire -&gt; MB -&gt; Smite -&gt; Wand
---
So you do kinda need everything.
---
im a level 38 priest and all the gear so far has been stam/intel/spirit   which all casters roll on regardless of dps or healing. The plus healing gear comes later.  So for most of levelling, there is just gear, no such thing as damage gear for these classes, otherwise we would have no gear to collect and your healers wouldn't be much use.
---
Meh not worth it over the defense.
---
Hi, my name is Nijel and I have a basketball game tomorrow, I'm a point guard, I got shoe game
---
For levelling, the faster spec is shadow, due to the damage increase talents. 
---
On the other hand, holy doesn't really fall very far behind and gives you additional healing prowess in group content.
---
Disc is more of a PvP spec, so I wouldn't advice leveling as disc.
---
He's likely referring to the basic target macro command.  Create a new macro and just type /target Broken Tooth.  Add the icon to your action bar, and run around the area hitting that button. If the mob is in the area close by, you will target it.
---
It's also very helpful for looking for named mobs for quests.
---
If you’re equally enjoying all 3 (which is the main focus) then look up the “life at 60” reddit posts where every classes end game in classic is discussed and go from there
---
My favorite was playing a packed AV in early vanilla, before cross-realm BGs. All of a sudden, everyone gets booted out of AV. Ok fine, where are we going? All of a sudden, Alliance and Horde load into a giant grey sky and begin falling. Both factions are too stunned to fight each other in mid-air. We look down, and see some rounded shapes begin to form. As it turns out, they are the spires of Thousand Needles. Whoever was not granted slowfall was granted a swift death in the basin.
---
Enraged ²
---
That... is actually really impressive
---
I mean sure, they're getting "slapped in the face" with millions of dollars given classic's success. I'd say they aren't really too worked up about it.
---
Okay soo... I'm gonna dweebiod WELL ACTUALLY here so bear with me. But, night elves are not 'just jungle people'. Trolls are just jungle people. All elves are trolls mutated by magic sources - so all elves are linked with magic sources to some degree. They are not all dependent on magic sources though - at this point in time no elves are dependent on non-divine sources of magic (more on that later).
---
Originally you had the Highborne/Quel'dorei who were trolls that lived by the Well of Eternity and were mutated by the magic from that. They are functionally identical to modern night elves in many ways. In fact some sources indicate that the Highborne were not the name of the OG elf species but were the name A few of the modern night elves *still living* were once Highborne elves that decided to go 'fuck magic imma live in a tree'.
---
When the Well of Eternity shattered the Highborne were split into several factions
---
* Faction A are those who still called themselves Highborne and went to go live in the basement of Dire Maul . They look like night elves but still happily practiced arcane magic. They reunited with Faction B in Cataclysm. In retail WoW they're a functional part of Night Elf society now and why we have Night Elf mages. They're not dependent on magic more than any other mage.
---
* Faction B went 'fuck magic. No non-natural sources of magic for us'. They went to live in trees - they are the Night Elves/Kal'dorei (children of the stars). Night Elves have two magical factions within them drawing said magic from natural sources\*. Priests draw magic from the moon/the goddess Elune. Druids draw magic from the moon/Elune, the sun/Anshe, and from nature via communing with the Emerald Dream and/or animal spirits. Any 'arcane' magic used by druids is moon/sun based.   
---
W/ the world tree: World trees form bridges between the Emerald Dream and the physical world.  Nordrassil was a special world tree that was blessed by the dragon aspects. When the dragon aspects blessed it they specifically gave gifts to the elves. The aspect of time Nozdormu gave them immortality inasmuch as they didn't age. When Nordrassil died any elves who were linked to that bargain lost immortality. They still all have stupid long lives though.  
---
All Night Elves are intrinsically tied to Elune in some weird ways though that the lore is just beginning to explore, as we saw in the Night Warrior thing that went down in BFA. 
---
* Faction C went "Fuck going 'fuck magic' - I don't wanna live in a tree" and set sail to find somewhere new to live with magic for them to use since they no longer had the Well of Eternity to draw on. They took some water from the Well of Eternity and fucked off from the majority of elven society (Faction B). Using that water they made the Sunwell. Living nearby the Sunwell two things happened: 1) they got hooked on its magic and needed it to stay sane and normal looking, and 2) they physically mutated as a result of consuming so much of the Sunwell's magic.  
---
They continued to call themselves the Quel'dorei... but other people started calling them just 'High Elves' instead of 'Highborne'. TBH it's weird that night elves ever got along with these folks and for high elves to be all around alliance cities in vanilla (I guess humans are OK with them so night elves had to put up with them being around?  
---
Eventually Arthas went and tainted the Sunwell to use its power for undead evil stuff. 90% of the High Elf population was killed off. Without a source of magic to draw on High Elves began to wither. Panicing Kael'thas (their prince) made a deal with the devil to get them some Fel (demonic) magic to live off of. These elves all declared themselves Blood Elves/Sin'dorei (Children of the blood).  
---
After this deal was done some elves lead by Lorthaemar Theron rejected the deal and the Fel magic it promised and went back to live in Silvermoon by the corrupted Sunwell, scraping by with whatever they could with magic - often vampiring it when they couldn't get it otherwise. Their eyes are tainted green by the touch of Fel.   
---
During this time Lady Liardin captured a Naaru to siphon off Light-based-power from it as a source of magic. This Naaru was stolen by Kael'thas who corrupted it into a void-god-thing. The belves were like 'dang I miss that tasty Light'.  Liardin went to another Naaru (A'dal) and apologized for kidnapping/imprisoning that other Naaru that Kael'thas ended up steal and A'dal was a real bro about the whole thing. The Naaru worked with the belves/the Horde/the Alliance to cleanse the Sunwell of its taint and stop KT from using the remaining power of the tainted Sunwell to do evil demonic stuff.  
---
The cleansed Sunwell is now a Light based source of power. Since Blood Elves now draw magical power from the divine source of the Light they're tied to the Light in a similar way to how Night Elves are tied to the moon. One sign of that is that some Blood Elves are now manifesting golden eyes (like my pally in the meme).
---
* Faction D (yeah, we've still got more elf factions to go) threw up a sheild around their city when the Well of Eternity shattered. Their city was built on the intersection of the ley lines (arcane power lines) of Azeroth. This intersection point is the Night Well. They continued to live their happy highborne lives using the Nightwell as a source of magic... and in a case almost identical to the Blood Elves they got addicted and mutated. They started calling themselves the Nightborne/ Shal'dorei (couldn't find an 'official' translation but the consensus is this probably means Children of the Night).  
---
(Incidentally this is p. much why the Nightborne were never, ever going to end up on the Alliance chillin with the Night Elves. Nelves are on the opposite end of the elf political spectrum from Nightborne/Belves. Even though Nelves have tenatively let a few Highborne rejoin them and start training new mages the Nelves are not on board with a magic saturated elven society for political reasons...  
---
... Whereas the Nightborne and Belves have extremely similar cultural stories and are at basically the same place on the elven political spectrum).  
---
We un-hooked these guys from the Night Well by feeding them fruit from an Arcan'dor. Arcan'dors are magically created trees which exist to balance arcane energies with energies from the Emerald Dream. So now - from what I can tell - the Nightborne are getting their elf-magic-energies they need to not wither from a combination of ambient arcane energies and natural magical energies similar to what druids use. With that said - it probably wouldn't be surprising if we end up with Nightborne druids eventually, since they're now in tune with Emerald Dream stuff.

(continued in another comment)
---
I'll let you know if I find any good farming spots then friend. :)
---
Hey, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Why does someone always have to mention this. I took screenshots using the printscreen button but I use reddit on my phone pretty much exclusively.
---
No they are a company they care about p/l not popularity contests.
---
How good is renew? I find myself only using heals in dungeons, simply because I kind of have forgotten that renew exists since I never use it. Should I use it more often?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but don't you also have to have the killing blow with drain soul to get the soulstone?
---
Right up till 60 you'll be fine. 60 dungeons you'll want some tanking items as well as your shield, and once you get to things like UBRS onward you'll want prot.
---
No it’s not. The difference between private servers and classic does not explain the huge gap in terms of performance between the specs. Arcane is fun to be able to trinket/ap-Pom-pyro someone and kill one person every 3 minutes.
---
But don’t try to make it efficient. It’s not.
---
Yes, only UBRS is more than 5 (10man) before raids.
---
Sounds like you just have a shitty job and its not at all related to the physical environment.
---
When you hit a wall, ask chat. You'll probably get some dumb responses, but usually you'll get actual responses. 
---
One tip I guess I would say is be kind and help people. Whether that be quests or with skills. As for the rest of the game, go play and learn it and have fun.
---
you should be able to heal the majority of instances throughout leveling as all feral. When you come past level 25, you should try to keep a set of healing gear with you at all times. This will make healing easier and possible as feral up until lvl atleast 50.
---
I had friends over for a lan for Classic's release. Back in the day when a new person arrived, everyone would go out to help them haul in the eight thousand pounds of gear.  Now every person can carry their entire setup in one go.
---
Kids these days don't know the back problems we gave ourselves carrying around those CRTs!  Make Lans Hurt Again!
---
Been in arathi highlands yet? thousand needles?
---
God I love classic gifs.
---
Whoa... spoilers on the titanic man. Sheesh
---
Da fuqi?
---
Tried going there couple times around different levels. Just 'noped' out and figured that this shit is not worth my time. STV is fine compared to that place.
---
Ashenvale was just filled with hordies who seemed to get an immense erection for pvp whenever they saw any alliance member in the distance. Even had few different level 60 guildies tell how the lvl 20-25 hordies went just nuts and tried to attack them.
---
I was browsing the sub wondering what was the name of the episode, you blowed my mind
---
Mofasa dies.
---
Nah, ezpz.  Run into the fort, die, resurrect next to the vendor.
---
You must have aced your probability class.
---
When grinding by myself I can't do that
---
Lol then do it. If your a tank with a shitty behavior (not talking about gloves) who thinks he is above the other players on the team. Get out and go somewhere else. There are other tanks, and if I started having trouble getting tanks. I would roll one, longest I have waited on a tank is about 15 minutes, my alt is also a tank because the activity is fun. I just happen to have enough friends who tank and heal that I can play what I want.
---
Tldr: if you have shitty behavior regardless of role go somehwhere else.
---
Also again despite reddit being angry communication goes a long way. Want an item for your non role? Just say that's what you want, and why you want it. If you don't, don't be suprised if someone gets angry. Not saying it's right, since its usually people not understanding why you need the item, and assuming you ninjad it sadly. From my experience at least.
---
That goddamn name woooweeee
---
Roger that, I'm just about to ding 39 and was thinking about trying to jump into Uldaman at 40 since there are so many quests.
---
Striking gold? You won’t get much for anything right now.
---
I thought that was my fate. For a few years I was putting in 80 hour weeks in WoW. I've since worked WoW into my life, and now I am gainfully employed and I live with my GF who also plays WoW (that's how I met her) and we have a good, comfortable life.
---
As a rogue strafing with evasion almost always guaranteed getting hit in the back, so you need to backpedal or evasion is basically useless. Lots of reasons in classic to not unbind the s key, it is useful.
---
because most of the talents are almost worthless.
---
I never do that shit.
---
Best recruiting line EVER
---
Dude I hate this quest. I logged off in the middle of it last night
---
Eh if your healer has a couple brain cells it’s not an issue at all.
---
I do carry hp pots and a sword/board macro just incase tho.
---
Yeah, Elune's song is the best. Perfectly in tune with the mysterious and serene forest.
---
Yeah, in this, I'll buy a green here or there as long as it's reasonably priced.
---
I'm saving for a mount after all.
---
Exactly, i asked him on my other account if he could help me out for a second. I traded him the bags (sure i couldve mailed but I happened to have another alt at that location with a couple of 6 slots) and then i relogged the 20 secs. I then came back in 1 second later, and then i had ignored me. So, I felt my duty to take the time to go to reddit and warn you Firemaw-Alliance people about this motherfucker.
---
I run a help desk call center for a major retailer.  Work is just very demanding.  Shitty is not how I would describe it.
---
Not sure about an add-on. I've been leveling with friends and just hold onto the gear I think they might want.
---
You just described 90% of the Alliance players I've encountered so far in Classic.
---
Ive been doing fine with quest and looted greens. But im rolling a mage so..
---
I'll probably do a dozen or so dungeon with my setup then with grid2 to see what I can get to work. Completly forgot this name existed for healing frame when it was kinda big if I remember. Thanks a lot for the reminder anyway.
---
God I tank aoe cleave groups in sm... and every pull before I even get agro the mages start aoeing, I mean it makes tanking more engaging but at the same
---
Time... ffs every mob runs every possible direction and then the dps run away from me instead of towards me. Or my personal fav is when they frost nova everything and stand next to it all casting blizzard and I get outta range and everything just turns on the mage and poof dead. Lol one day dps May learn to watch agro... but I wouldn’t count on it unless it’s a full guild run
---
WOTLK
---
Layering does not effect the population cap as a whole, what it does it split the population into several full Azeroths so we don't have the mayhem of 8-9000+ private servers. It allows for a higher amount of players to actually play, when layering is removed, the servers will likely revert to normal log in limits, not what we have now. If it was removed NOW, there would be queues on servers that currently do not have queues.
---
This whole response is awesome and I’d like to see more like it!
---
Probably. If they see profits to be made, they'll do it.
---
Yep. I loved my tri talent tree mage. I actually did decently well with it.
---
Grid is the best IMO
---
Well they don’t, mentally ill people pull the trigger not the gun.
---
And if guns are illegal they will obtain one illegally.
---
And if guns are unavailable they will find something else to kill with.
---
They problem here is mental health.
---
The fact that Redbridge, wetlands, Dusk wood, and maybe another I'm forgetting are pvp zones while the horde gets to hide in Barrens forever is also bullshit.
---
I am taking a look at playing a rogue, since I love stealth. However, I hear they are overpopulated? I don't really want to compete with thousands of other rogues.
---
Is it easier to just go feral druid?
---
If you have a bit more patience you can get a decent mh/oh from the SM and RFD quests.  You’ll need to be around level 37 to find a group to do them both too.
---
I for one am unable to play it as casual as I should, just like I would not be able to play any sport with my friends without getting competitive. Probably depends on what kind of person you are nowadays, I will try raiding hardcore even though I dont have 6+ hours everyday to play anymore.   
---
What made me start playing is the thought that vanilla raiding is super casual so once on farm you only have to allocate 4-5 hours two days a week, three on progress maybe. As long as I avoid pulling girlfriend aggro on the way there it should be coolio.
---
I guess you can start at 38-39. And no only Library best mob density and less patrols.
---
Gotta try
---
It's things like this that really touch my heart. Reminds me of the time I saw a lonely alliance priest just trying to kill some quest mobs. So I summoned a group of 10 horde and we spawn camped that priest till she took the spirit healer res and logged. It's interactions like that that really make wow the great gaming community it is.
---
I spent like 80 silver at 20 to get myself a nice shield and 1-hander to tank on my pally. I certainly wouldn't buy all my gear there, though.
---
And my staff? 
---
amidoright?
---
Man, that's really cool :)
---
You can join and leave in seconds.
---
chossing between 3 abilities every tier in bfa requires more thought than filling a tree to get one of the few good talents.
---
Pretty sure you can summon them, just not see them when they’re teleported. So they’ll stay in their different layer. I haven’t touched retail in a couple of weeks, tho, so they may have changed it
---
you should try adding castsequence instead of just cast. What this does is it creates a sequence that is followed; your first button press will cast the first spell, second the second, and so on.
---
seems like an odd macro to use (in my opinion) but whatever works for you.
---
Separate things entirely. They are add-ons to the regular game, and improve your QoL in different ways.
---
Since this is your first rodeo and you said you're not rushing to 60, I say skip the Questie addon, at least for a start. It removes so much of the immersion, slaps out marks on your map where you're supposed to go to finish every quest etc - rather than actually, you know, reading a quest log or having a human interaction with another player when you're asking where to find X and Y. 
---
Classic wowhead/ classicdb are good online sources for if you're stumped and can't find something or get help in-game - but for the most part you should be OK just asking people in General chat. Might not want to ask something once every minute though, that can lead to some annoyance in the long run.
---
Thieving little shit!
---
Oh, dont worry i know it did. But then again, people also got ignored in vanilla. So i'm actually only here to warn you about that guy
---
What level are you running these dungeons?  You definitely can forgo a tank if you massivly outgear or out level the content.  We used to do Strath and Scolo without a “true” tank with people with Naxx and Aq gear. 
---
But playing a dungeon “at level”, and by that I mean no one higher than three levels below the boss?  You’d better have a tank, and you’d better let them take the hits because your dps will get pulverized.
---
Can anyone help in this map place. I’m looking for water elementals but can’t find any. Thanks!
---
Your name is highly fitting.  You're a trash father.
---
Yup. You can always spam Rank 1 SW:P to fish for blackout procs tho
---
Essential* 
---
Bagnon
---
Leatrix maps
---
Questie 
---
Atlas loot
---
Swing timer (for melee classes)
---
PW:S you can just right-click off if they don't stop. They will (hopefully) get the message after they realize how much mana they're wasting. And yea, sometimes bad groups are just gunna happen unfortunately. Be on the lookout for good players and make friends with them, to reduce the amount you have to run with randoms.
---
good for warlocks that love lifetap. in raids only the person specced into imp renew will be using it on the tank since it doesnt stack. it's good to smooth out big damage spikes that you expect will be coming directly before precasting a heal or something. i use it when im being cautious
---
Nice thanks I was trying to figure out how to do it!
---
This makes me want to reroll dwarf hunter
---
Sodapoppins raid couldn’t kill ragg for example 🤷‍♂️
---
The titanic sunk????
---
Wait the original or Titanic 2?
---
Just because your fellow Hunter is not casting pet heal right now doesn't mean that he shouldn't be stacking up on his pet heal equipment.
---
I had this when I tanked on my warrior and needed on a 2h. Got abuse from a ret paladin. It's like, mate. The only reason I even have a shield is so I can be helpful by tanking for people like you. You're welcome.
---
And exactly people like you are why you are not trusting random people. geez ego much
---
A Forsaken DK: I was killed and raised from the dead in the service of the Lich King, against my will,twice.
---
I'm playing on my living room TV lol
---
Well, I'm comparing with TBC. But never mind.
---
People are frequently asking for 43 or 44+ for Uldaman, and I believe that is correct. A group of 42s will struggle a lot on the last boss.
---
The majority of the Uldaman quests are outside of the instance though and should be completed beforehand as they lead to quests actually inside the instance.
---
Dude that could be REALLY cool
---
&gt;MOP came out same year Kung Fu panda did...
---
A quick google search will tell you Kung Fu Panda came out in 2008. MoP in 2012. I like how people come on here and ramble bullshit with complete confidence. I disliked MoP as well, but come on man.
---
Extremely easy to get because of layering. He’s only a 4 hour respawn.
---
Remove this post please, at least for 2 more days :D
---
What is the spell bar addon called? I like the way the circles look.
---
I like it windowed so I can quickly alt tab to my browser or whatever else during flight but thanks!
---
I mean, if you have to work 90 hours a week(?) that sounds really shitty to me. Pretty wildly unethical, even.
---
Depends on the dungeon. I've done all SM instances without a tank extremely efficiently. It depends a bit on the setup thoguh. The ideal for me is 3 mage 1 warlock 1 priest. Warlock pulls with Eye of Kilrog.
---
&gt; and supplied us with tons of potions and general raiding supplies
---
so, she roleplayed as your guilds grandma?
---
Careful you don't get banned for account sharing
---
I think you could see Mana gains with something like MSBT as well, in case you have trouble setting up the WA trigger.
---
Bruh...
---
"World drop" refers to items that can be dropped by nearly any regular enemy out in the open world. Mostly stuff like the 6 slot bags but there are a handful of BOE purples out there like the staff in OP's picture
---
Awesome! Thanks so much!
---
Bruce Willis were a ghost all along.
---
Maybe just maybe this way they get a kick in the behind to actually make a WOW 2 and implement it based on what made Classic so great and not the modern micro transaction filled mobile gaming wanna be trash they've been shoving in our faces.
---
Lmfao
---
Kung Fu Panda came out in 2008.  
---
Mists came out in 2012.
---
I feel like we can stop mocking fellow WoW gamers at any point now.
---
Dude! Not cool.
---
Kromcrush balance isn’t great, but it’s about normal for the American PVP servers.
---
Thanks! Do you think it would be a good idea to take some tank talents like Thick Hide or Primal Fury over Clearcasting?
---
Amen🙏
---
NO! JUST NO!
---
And here I am using MC to buff them with stamina.
---
Warden Staff and Manual Crowd Pummeler would be better. I’d try reselling it.
---
Unfortunately, yes. A stealthed character can be spotted without any aid if they come too close, an invisible one can not.
---
But don't quit your buffing habit! Even if it doesn't help them spot rogues or druids, it's nice to have against dispelling classes, so there is a chance they'll dispel the detection buff instead of something like Fortitude, blessings, etc.
---
I didn't mean to indicate that it was hard to level up, or I'm having issues with people or anything. I just hate being guild spammed by people and wanted to see if i was the only one
---
Thanks for the explanation. If I remember correctly that only applies to skills above a certain level- is this right or is my memory wrong?
---
There's no need for healing specs until raiding. Stick to your shadow talents.
---
I don't really want to see the mana gains, I want to see when I'm about to gain more mana
---
You could try running RFK and SM GY for a few levels to get you into the low 30s. 
---
Have you done the entire Battle for Hillsbrad and "The Den" quest chains?
---
Also, I'd invite everyone to read this thing about druid tanks: [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla)
---
And you'll realize they're actually not bad in raids either. But more as off-tanks (though you certainly can maintank too, just a bit worse than warriors since you take more dmg).
---
If you want to minmax, Engineering is the only option. If that matters less to you, Alchemy/Herbalism is really strong. Skinning and Leatherworking is also an option.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=do+i+need+the+newest+wow+expansion+to+play+classic
---
I used a boar for most of the early leveling. The stun helped control some threat and their dash helps them get into combat before you get more than an autoattack off. If you are just grinding they really speed things up since they have the fastest movement speed. This falls off once you get the talent that increases pets move speed, but still really strong.
---
Some useful ones are Charge/Rend or Charge/Hamstring
---
Very basic: 
---
 #showtooltip Charge
---
/cast Charge
---
/cast Rend
---
If you're out of combat, you'll cast charge. If in combat, in range, and have sufficient rage, you'll cast Rend. I start most every encounter with a double-tap of this macro because Charge gives the rage you need for Rend. 
---
Another useful one is a Shield Bash Macro. You'll unequip your 2h, equip your 1h+Shield, then go back again
---
 #showtooltip Shield Bash
---
/equip (1h wep name)
---
/equip (shield name)
---
/cast Shield Bash
---
/equip (2h wep name)
---
Those are the two that I've been using. I'm sure there are more. Here is a link with a lot more detail. 
---
https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/21992-guide-1121-warrior-macros/
---
no, if tanks can't hold aggro vs dps that want to blizzard or do whatever their aoe is, that's a problem with the design of tanks and not the behavior of the dps. playing this handicapped weak tank garbage is lame and having a 4th dps is probably better.
---
He can't he's lactose intolerant.
---
Yea I completed the battle for hillsbrad chain there
---
Best combo is NE priest! Wait at the lift at the edge of the Barrens, see little hordies waiting....mind control and FREEDIVE!!!
---
Deviate Delight sounds like the perfect name for an ERP realm though
---
Since launch I've been leveling a human rogue on Nogganfogger, but one night during a queue I made a undead warlock on Zandalar Tribe on a whim. I've had so many good interactions on ZL that I don't want to go back, but I also don't want to abandon my rogue ☹️ not really sure what to do
---
is it possible to recover my old account? and if so, does it even matter? do I like recover friends list?
---
It's also bound to spellcast time look answer above
---
They had restated they will remove layering by phase 2, even if it adds queues to the more populated servers in the AMA
---
Bloody fairies!
---
That's the best thing ever! Thank you for the link!
---
4 hours of sleep? How do you even function efficiently. There isnt a single person in my field who dares consistently getting less that 6 or so.
---
Absolutely. I've found it handy being resto for cleave groups but its not nessecary
---
Agree, people will charge trough MC and will see this as not necessary.
---
I think the price will even go down when more and more groups will go to MC.
---
Got to add compression socks to my packing list for the biannual LAN we have with a bunch of friends.
---
I found mine at my parents house when they were cleaning stuff out. Was able to read the whole thing before classic came out
---
Herod server has their own channel for layer invite spam. It's pretty nice. Still get a few every so often in the LFG channel but it's not that bad.
---
How do you put a password on a global chat?
---
Is that shadowed unit frames you are using for your own player frames?
---
It's a mess. the pirate servers did that and it just turns into a misery of impossible to tag mobs and pvp every ten feet. It might be fun for pvp lovers for a little bit but it breaks the game.
---
There was a fire fight!!!!!!
---
When you've completed a zone, wait 5 levels and return to it. Lots of quests to be had. I returned to STV 4 times.
---
1, if you're a spell caster get a wand ASAP, they're worth their weight in gold and have an immediate and noticable impact on your killing speed.
---
2, realise you dont need to learn EVERY spell your trainers can teach you. E.g. priests... mind vision? Get to fuck. You'll find certain spells are either useless OR are spells you can leave to when you've got your lvl 40 mount (again mana burn for priests I will leave till later.)
---
3, sell EVERYTHING you wont use and utilise professions to make cash.
---
4, try and do dungeons at least once, but if you're gonna do them also try to ensure you have the quests for them to maximize the exp gain.
---
So true
---
Is your character female?
---
Oh i just did lmao, rip 1 gold
---
The only thing they care about is their ROI.
---
I always just bind pet follow to my mount.  If i'm in combat i can't mount anyways, and if i'm trying to mount I need my pet to get out of combat.  Works like a charm.  Dedicating a whole keybind to it for me seems wasteful, but that's purely my opinion.
---
dont sell it now, keep it for the market to correct, then it would be worth way more! :D
---
Yes it is possible, worth it or not, that's up to you.
---
Also every dungeon is somehow right next to a horde flight path but alliance have to walk across 3 zones.
---
Wait, what?
---
Dual monitor with fullscreen movie/show or wowhead + music.
---
GZ
---
Neverwinter Online kind of does this. It actually works quite well. 
---
Unfortunately the rest of the game is a pure shitshow.
---
I stopped reading when the post got to each other quoting 5 different things about a mid level axe. Seriously you use it for a few days played maximum. Who the fuck cares enough to argue like this. Its seriously comical
---
No it wasn't the original. It was a separate server from the original launch of runescape, which was available to members who had played early on, and later released to anyone who logged into it on certain dates.
---
What about the boy king of Stormwind?

---
I worked with NetEase and no, you have no control over what they do with your games as a publisher.
---
So much to unpack here....
---
Imma just throw it a down vote until proof is posted and be on my way
---
Shadow is the preferable spec for leveling because you are stronger (also take wand specialisation) and also because you can easily heal until raiding with shadow spec.
---
However since most of your leveling damage comes from wands anyways you can level holy as you want to. It's not AS good but you are not on a major disadvantage but as I said it doesn't really makes sense
---
It's the true Vanilla experience.
---
So that you don't start casting right before a mana tick while combat-regenerating, you mean? Not sure how to do that, but it would be pretty easy to just start casting after seeing a Mana gain tick in. Best of luck, though.
---
no they haven't, that's literally not a thing
---
Level 19 warrior
---
Level 21 paladin
---
Level 13 hunter
---
Level 14 rogue  
---
yeah... maybe I could have used my two weeks off more effectively
---
My man, go to [battle.net](https://battle.net) and download the Blizzard launcher, create a new account or use your old one if you can. Since you are in EU, it should automatically direct you to the EU launcher and account. 
---
Download the game. Click the drop down menu above DOWNLOAD to change between Retail and Classic. 
---
Right next to the download/play button should be another button that says add game time. Click that, it will redirect you to a payment page to set up your subscription. 
---
Voila! One of us.
---
That’s classic. It was always around. Your wrong I’m an avid rs player
---
Really? i read it makes stealth itself better overall
---
What's this Summer of '69?
---
Oh, well just know that some where in an alternate server a red haired dwarf Hunter had trouble getting to WC as well.

Lets you turn on and off features. E.g. you can only have it only show you where quests are availble, or you can set it to show you where to pick them up, turn them in, and where to progress them (on your map and mini map)

you may need to "/console reloadui"   every now and then after moving to new area, it sometimes doesn't list everything in new areas.

Currently this only works for 1-40.
---
It has a few issues, 
---
1, in classic the only options are "/aap skip" (skips current way point) and "/aap reset" (reset the current zone).
---
2. It's on rails,  it wants to go exactly where it says do exactly what it says, if you go off path, you can confuse it.
---
3. If you skip something because it's heavily camped, it doesn't automatically skip the to follow up. E.g. if you skip collecting 30 turtle tails, it will still instruct you to turn those tails in, (so you need to skip again), then instruct you to pick up the follow up quest (so you have to skip again) etc.
---
I would do atleast one run of each of the SM dungeons with quests. They are fun, provide good xp, and good gear for your classes (especially cathedral). Arathi highlands is also a good place to quest around that level. Around 40 you can go to badlands. Remember that the quest zones were designed to make you come back to a zone multiple times on your path to 60. In stranglethorn vale, you can come back to that zone for quests atleast two or three more times (while getting extra quests from booty Bay). A good trick not to underlevel zones is to always kill mobs on the way to your next quest objective, especially when you don't have a mount.
---
Classic has only been out a week it's too early to say for sure and people need to stop acting like it's a runaway success story smh calm down to check back in a month
---
Haha yeah exactly!
---
It's not even sort of a swastika....
---
You should go to blackfathom deeps for an awesome wand by completing a quest. If you're lucky, you may also get a staff that adds 10 int and 11 spr from the orc warlock boss before the final hydra boss.
---
Use the Spy addon
---
mage out ranges shaman easy, and slow doesnt effect blink, pally bubble: ok cool ill come back and PoM you when its gone, hunter is playing a solo game haha any time he has to actually team up hes on the shit list.
---
Still not even close to Jessica Rabbit.
---
Is that soul bind on creation? The dive helmet.
---
I will never understand this 'anti-addon' weirdness.
---
Kill stuff constantly while traveling.
---
You will run out of quests at times otherwise
---
Do spells not get queued up in classic?  You don't have to spam at all to get perfect spellcasting.
---
Wow, thanks so much! We just gotta get more people submitting reports. I'll try and submit mine tonight.
---
btw, does battle chest still exist? something to get started cheaper?
---
I think he has his Vive home set to a fan-made rendition of the map of SW and the surrounding area. Extends to Goldshire, but doesn't deviate much further out than that. If there are any other WoW focused homes I'd love to see more as well.
---
he just gonna swim
---
stonks
---
Well, today i was in the south of the barrens to get the eggs on the fields there with the insects.
---
I never stole Q things before. I buff all chars I meet and heal if they need heal ,even If i just got somewhere.
---
But then some orc stole an egg right in front of me. 
---
What did i do next? Yea, i took an egg in front of an undead..
---
What I want to tell you? People change their behavior bc of good or rude people. I am surely not the only one to do that.
---
There's way more than just one rare pet though. I had a huge collection of them in Retail. I think there was a wolf, tiger, gorilla and bear that I used a lot. All rare.
---
I am sorry that this has been your experience so far but I haven't experienced any of this. My entire time up to level 30 so far has been amazing and this is mostly due to the fantastic community. Maybe you got unlucky and rolled on the same server as all the assholes?
---
On the zeppelin my guy
---
And that's 95% of the Horde players I've encountered so far in Classic.
---
Stop the flame.
---
I didn't make anything up. This is an example of why communication with your group BEFORE things like this happen is,so important.
---
What you may consider status quo or common sense, others may not.
---
who cares lmao  ima get the world first on a random rat in the middle of nowhere
---
How do I layer hop?
---
What are you gonna farm
---
25-35 is pretty grindy you can try ganklethorn or what i did was get a couple Guildies and farmed sfk bfd and rfk for a few levels
---
Was that on zandalar tribe? I ganked with some1 called ripjaw
---
Look for IT roles, hardware software break fix is a solid paying job. With no experience on the resume you will get low balled but after you have a few years on the resume jobs that start out at 50k+ a year will open up to you. I started out with a Help Desk role just to get IT on my resume. I've changed companies a few times in these past 8 years to take promotions and pay raises but that's how IT works for most companies if you want to continue working up. Set a goal to be a Tier 3 tech, the upper echelon of hands on tech stuff. Pivot to development if you want. I've had two companies offer me dev positions even though I have no experience in it due to my resume in IT, they were willing to train me from ground up. Granted, all of this does depend on your location. If you live in a small town, work with the Ma and Pa shops to start building your resume.
---
Best I can do is 2$
---
God I just love Hillsbrad
---
However, we also want to assure you that the issue is a much smaller problem than some people are claiming. 
---
So some are exploiting the layering but few...
---
I see, does the mouseover works on nameplates, actual characters or both? I assume you must be using some sort of name plate addon to make the mouseover smoother?
---
Tbh wool is going for insane amounts in my server so good to know lol
---
As an alliance warlock,  I looted those cages for the big iron fishing pole.
---
Underwater breathing doesn't compete with sealform for harvest speed, but not having to swim to a bubble rock or the surface every minute or so makes this trivial for warlocks also.
---
I just hit 37 and I did the exact same thing (Just got divine spirit). Probably still going to go shadow at 40 or 44 but discipline has been great
---
Ah yes, i’m familiar with the type. I play another game, old school runescape, and the same people bitch and complain about every little thing. Its gotten to the point where, for the past two years, the scumbags keep a calendar schedule of all the things the development team has supposedly fucked up.
---
If layering wasn't a problem would they state that they are looking into fixing the issue? 
---
&gt; we agree that we should add a delay between subsequent layer transfers. Under the hood we have all the controls I talked about in the Reddit AMA before launch, a few secret weapons we haven’t discussed publicly, and we’re working on deploying some additional controls to further restrain layering from being exploitable.
---
I'm a warrior! daze daze daze daze dead
---
When did we leave the meme epoch?  Also Post Meme E-Pac is the name of my new trap mix tape
---
how do i make the chat like that
---
My mistake
---
He looks like he will invade Azeroth with his russian army..
---
I watched a lot of videos pre-classic on this, did some testing myself but not enough to feel 100% certain with what im about to tell you, that being said its been working great for me
---
Use bite and now claw. Bite does more damage/focus and with the cd your pet can weave growls in between as well
---
Good choice on the pet, a really fast attack speed. You can also get a level 32 mountain lion in alteric mountains that knows prowl - also panthers in stv i forget which ones specifically
---
Just because a few people did crazy strats doesn't mean it is a good reflection of a normal classic wow experience. Almost nobody did this. The AoE farming is extreme nowadays, I see it all the time. I don't give a shit if you enjoy doing this but don't pretend this to be a normal average joe classic wow experience
---
The market is twinks
---
I know how they work, which is why I know that they're not mechanically connected to pop cap, Blizz have said so themselves.
---
Anxiety problems
---
You remind me of this guy.

---
&gt; Stop the flame. 
---
And you are adding a layer.
---
Multi dot a few pulls if there’s room to fear is good, you can do that and then kill a few targets single to recover life/mana.
---
I’m 53 atm and switched to succubus in my early 20s and never looked back. Make sure when you get Dark Pact that none of her abilities are set to autocast and she will regen mana fast enough that you will never have downtime. Her autoattacks will still account for like 20% of your dps while grinding which far outweighs what a passive imp would do. And you still have seduce when necessary, can have her invis herself if you need to go somewhere and are worried her pathing would aggro extra stuff, and she can absorb the first 1-2 hits from most mobs you pull which spreads the damage you take out and makes it even more efficient.
---
We all have phones though right?
---
It's a UI overhaul I use called ElvUI
---
Who the fuck is asmongold and why should people care
---
I created a rouge just to gank him
---
Y'all got way to much time on your hands.
---
This won't happen in Classic, at least not on nearly the same scale. The original mafia was the result of a perfect storm of factors, many of which won't be reproducible in classic (ex: all of the top pvp players being on the exact same server).
---
You will probably still see cross-faction collusion and even attempts to copycat the Devilsaur Mafia, but you won't see one nearly as effective as we saw on Nost.
---
Most people at my office job who "work" 12 hours a day work maybe 6 of those 12 hours max and are "working" the other 6+. Aka doing a whole lot of nothing more than looking busy.
---
Is he PvP flagged?
---
I am loving this community! I can be solo questing and need to fight an elite, find a rando and 99% of the time they will stop what they are doing to help me! It's crazy the sense of mutualism this community shares. Everyone is so generous and congratulatory when you win the rolls for loot. Being a first time player, it is this community that helps keep my interest in the game!
---
Well, you should get similar exp, but you get the rewards on top of it. Also helps not getting bored by doing different things in different areas.
---
Unless you have something you need to grind specifically (leather, cloth or whatever), i'd go questing.
---
It's not at all shit design, it's just not probably what you're used to.
---
Personally, as a 38 pally tank I could hold threat just fine with mages using Blizzard. If they used CoC/Nova right after I pulled though I'd lose it. 
---
Part of the design is players need to be awake of and manage their threat levels.
---
Hey man, give Jordan his staff back..
---
Working fine

Editing out char names? Why?
---
I've had a few people comment on how russian he looks the dwarven dance makes it look even better
---
Druids are excellent dungeon tanks all the way through, and the tanking mechanics are very simple and straightforward.
---
For raid encounters, you'll need to be geared to the teeth* to be given the chance to tank - and you'll probably be relegated to OT status. The reason is that druids cannot become uncrittable in Classic. Instead, druids build up a massive HP pool, stack that with armor (and as much agility for dodge as possible), and you've got a tank that can - to a degree - eat an occasional crushing blow. 
---
*The nice thing about druid tanking gear is that most of it can be had pre-raid
---
She's still trying to find it.
---
Yeah i agree, u can implement that without a increse in levels tough :)
---
As a programmer, programming is really simple to learn. Dont get discouraged if you dont get it at first, but all programming languages share a common logic that, once you learn it, will basically let you program in any language or learn any new one.
---
If you want easy but good money id look into welding. 6 month degree is all thats required and starting pay can be as high as 70k/y iirc
---
Was lvling tailoring en made a ton of wool en linen bags so i went to goldshire en just gave them away for free
---
Questing is for fun tho. Learn about the zone and story. Lores.
---
I almost got all the Moonstalker Fangs in Darkshore. I should have all 6 in a few more hours.
---
Love being a LW and questing with random people, usually ends up with me gifting them random pieces of gear I've made - was especially common around 25-30 cause of all the shoulder gear I was crafting.
---
I know just how you feel! My first character was alliance before switching to Horde later on. I always loved the instance (it was my first). 
---
When Classic was nearly launched I was thinking how much I would love to do it but wouldn’t find a group of Horde to go. 
---
Then, when I was around the appropriate level, I happened to see someone advertising for a healer for the last spot of a DM group. 
---
We swam there from STV which was fun in itself and then did Deadmines and it was amazing. Loved it :)
---
Redditors will downvote this
---
They wont be added, there will be a server for  them for people who want to stay in vanilla.
---
Feels like its too late already at this point. People have farmed shit already
---
HOW JOIN TAR TRIBE
---
Guess who's the first NPC going to die once I reach Stormwind?
---
Copied from my other reply
---
&gt;Underwater breathing doesn't compete with sealform for harvest speed, but not having to swim to a bubble rock or the surface every minute or so makes this trivial for warlocks also.
---
As an alliance warlock,  I looted those cages for the big iron fishing pole. (currently sells around 5g on my server on alliance side, which I couldn't afford)
---
What level were you? I'm 23 with a bunch of greens, hopefully that will enough to tame him.
---
Do you have an download pack, for simple and easy switch out?
---
Better than getting "no connected pathways".
---
Both assuming the UI is working properly for nameplates and they're targetable through them.
---
I'm using ElvUI and there's not much difference other than slightly bigger nameplates/fonts on them. Didn't need to, just preference. You can use default UI nameplates just fine.
---
world chat is a very baseline channel for literally all servers, if you think it can just be recreated you don't know how it works. This 1 asshole has ruined an entire channel in which people get groups and communicate.
---
This is a great post, thank you so much for thinking of those less fortunate. /Salute
---
You kid, but enhance put out pretty good dps in dungeons while leveling, while also being one of the best support classes
---
Haha, I love the bluntness of that post.  
---
People need this sort of reality-check once in a while.
---
Yes i'm very interested too, i have only one screen :'(
---
I think i can do it on the task manager, right clic-&gt; options -&gt; always visible and it will always be first place even if u are in a gamesoftware that normally put everything aside when you click in.
---
I'm sure there's a way to do it, i hope op respond
---
Where that Barrens chat at tho?
---
That's telekinesis, Kyle.
---
I'm not sure if its in vanilla, but while healing, you gain a buff which greatly enhances stealth detection.
---
I only have TB discovered in Mulgore even though I crossed the whole area from Barrens.
---
It's a community ruining experience for an entire server
---
Using Zygor as Guideline Sage didn't have arrows for all steps with steps such as  "Speak to Twinkle just east" so you spend 20 seconds trying to find Twinkle wast of where you are.
---
Zygor has arrows for every step and even optimal paths but I did 24-25 in 2.5 hours /played which is slow af (as a druid)
---
Dat finger though
---
No worries! Have a great weekend :D
---
It's a player made channel.
---
Thats pretty wild. No AC in those temps with manual labour jobs (never mind stationary ones) really ought to be illegal but heyo, capitalism...
---
Big respect for your dad.
---
Doesn't help with your question but someone recommended adding /cast pickpocket before all of your stealth opener moved to grab loot off every mob you kill automatically :)
---
No joke me and two other priests the other night got away with MCing \*every\* Horde off the boat before the loading screen. Felt mighty gud.
---
I don't think there's a single server that does that. More like, a top 10. Sadly, even the most dedicated private servers have turned out not to be as blizzlike as we thought, but maybe you could get an idea of what it's like.
---
&gt; Have to head to stormwind 
---
\*Ally spotted\*
---
 **Lok-Narash!**
---
The AMA they did said down the road they will probably offer them as they did exist in vanilla but no plan/date
---
i liked the feel of victorian era in gilneas quite a bit, the artists did an amazing job imo. too bad it was an instanced worthless impactless shitshow.
---
Thanks !
---
Idiot
---
Is this the server Whitemane? I swear I’ve grouped dungeon with this dude.
---
Create world chat bis and let the entire server use that one...
---
You're free to believe what you want. I'm sure they can raise the pop per layer once they remove additional ones but the server caps will drastically shrink.
---
I camped mine for 6 1/2 hours. His respawn timer is 8-12 hours.
---
Been on Felstriker since day two - it’s definitely not dead!
---
I’m too low for cath and I did a bunch of arm runs and got better loot from gy
---
Wouldn't Claw do higher DPS, since there's no cooldown? Bit has a 10 second cooldown, costs 35 focus and does 81-99. Claw has no cooldown, costs 25 focus and does 43-59.
---
You can cast it just wait 10 seconds until the tank has enough threat
---
They effectively had to remake the entire game over the past 2.5 years. Hardly minimal work and/or investment.
---
My boy and girl cat are exactly the same!
---
The extra space on the second line is triggering me.
---
Roll paladin/warlock...enjoy ;-)
---
hydrate check bois
---
All this alt, shift, and control nonsense. I just want to mash the button and move on.
---
Well I just want to be efficient, both builds are fine for me, it's just that I tend to not aoe grind, but I feel like I'm wasting a lot of mages potential if I don't do it
---
Just listened again and I certainly Mandela effected the shit out of that one.
---
That's how i like to play - i am bound to hit some walls - 
---
I help people loads in mmo style games so i will carry on within wow
---
Not Mythic.Also scaling starts from 10.
---
I got him a day or two after release. One of my favorites, congrats!!
---
I think it vendors for 2g 17s 70c
---
Wow.
---
As someone from Wowhead, thanks for the link highlights! We've been revamping our leveling, profession, and dungeon guides in the past week as well based on feedback (weapon leveling paths, list of endgame recipes for each profession, dungeon quest walkthroughs) etc.
---
Albert
---
Easy, give your baby WoW and you'll save several hours per day
---
Can you tell me the vendors price for it?
---
&gt;  and locking access to PvP talents behind PvE quests
---
well then dont :D, i gave a plethora of ways to implement, pick one ud like :)
---
lol its 5 seconds only
---
As a former guild/raid leader, I'd be willing to bet I could rank my former guildies' income today with great accuracy based soley on their performance during farming runs.
---
Well, you helped me finding balance conditions, so it's good ! thank you :)
---
Yep, this is what I do everytime, got on the boat last night with like ten horde and a few of those priests stealth Ed on and all the way back.
---
This is the first time I'm actually able to craft things for my level which is pretty neat. It's fun running around leveling in gear that I created and have it actually compete/be better than the stuff I get for quests.
---
Go rogue. Druid is for hybrid players
---
Always keep a soulstone active on yourself.
---
some of the fish you can farm are solid money makers eventually-- they can used for various potions and food recipes. You can also fish up lock boxes or something similar that doesn't need a rogue to unlock (or both? can't recall)-- they can have greens, mana pots, bags etc
---
Give it time. I'm ahead of the level curve a pretty decent amoutn on my server, and it's almost like no one has kept mining leveled. I just hit 40 last night and got my mount. I was pretty much the only person, maybe 1 other posting iron. We didnt undercut each other. I hit mithril 2 days before him but he caught up and we didn't undercut again. I made my mount gold off iron and mithril easy and it's still rolling in for epic now. Will continue to truesilver and thorium most likely at the same pace as the other dude.
---
Every time I see someone use a cool ability I'm like "yep, gonna have to make one of those now."
---
Recently saw a priest in shadowform so now I'm levelling a priest.
---
Save the money unless you truly need an upgrade. That said, the AH prices are the most reasonable right now they’ll ever be.  I found a Killmaim axe (high dps, 2H axe for level 21) and it only sold for 2g.  There are deals to be had since everyone is trying to make money and no one has any.  I regret not giving this a way to a buddy nw for free.
---
Yeah I'm trying to raise a successful adult tho
---
Look man. Whores in Goldshire are a small price to pay for no que times.
---
I can see your point. People say it’s a journey and an adventure, fuck that I did this shit 14 years ago, why am I going to go back and experience it again?  I have a good memory, I didn’t forget what westfall looked like. It was agonizing and I hated every second of leveling but still loved the game for some reason.
---
I believe there is a hidden option to drop the selected specialisation. You do not have to re do engineering! Good luck.
---
Good luck friend, there's a ton of great games out there, now that you're not dumping hundreds of hours into wow you have tons of 'free' time to check them all out. I can highly recommend Red Dead Redemption 2 if you've not played it already. Peace
---
Correct - you cannot level together
---
All you smiths are welcome to send me level 20’s blue mail.
---
Exact same thing happened to me at that level.  Between 29-30 I had practically finished those zones you mentioned but felt too low for Arathi/Desolace/STV etc.  
---
Ended up just hopping in an RFK group and then grinding out a bit at the first ogre mound in Arathi to finish up.  At 32ish it feels like you have a lot more options.
---
I’m on earthfury and I’ve had no problem doing dungeons or seeing people. Maybe you’re just bad at the game when everything isn’t being spammed nonstopped and handed to you?
---
I mean, why bother with what other people are doing ? Just do what you like. 
---
If you're playing for efficiency with aoe builds, and everyone is doing the very same thing taking all the aoe spots and actually slowing each other down, single target farming might aswell be the most efficient way to do it.
---
I was on my way to Senjin Village as a 29 warrior for the Brutal armor quest and some level 6 hunter needed help with  clearing Tiragarde Keep. I said, what the hell, lemme help this man out. Took me five minutes and he was happy as all get out. Maybe he'll pass on the kindness to a lowbie one day, maybe he won't. I did my part.
---
It also lacked inc heals, but as stated above i'll give a try to grid and my luna raid frames for a bit then see if any is working decently enough for me. Thanks for proposing still :)
---
Needs more mud too.
---
Shut up.
---
as a druid I have healed 5 mans jsut fine with default UI only change I made was using raidframes for party.
---
NGL dude, if you rolled on a staff that you were "sometimes" going to use just because "it's an upgrade"... you're a dick.
---
Just because you *can* do something doesn't mean you *should*.
---
You could both roll on a PvE server, do the quests that are available to both factions and grind on mobs, but generally the experience would be pretty horrible.
---
They killed it.
---
You could level together, but it’s gonna be tricky.
---
I'm loving it. I have a ton of utility people love, and I outdamage most people on single target fights except geared warriors.
---
His whole point is that everyone who has a bank full did it without exploitation...
---
You’re always chasing the next promotion or thing to get. Just enjoy what you have right this moment.
---
We should have not made this bargain.
---
Yeah I always drop stoneclaw first but sometimes the extra mobs that fire nova pulls get overwhelming so I just stick with searing 😅
---
Jesus
---
That's usually considered a "greed".
---
Netease has a huge amount of control, chinese POE players have QoL items they can buy that arent in other regions because the devs dont want them in the game, but they cant do anything about it when tencent puts new content into the chinese client.
---
Probably misunderstood you and thought that you are BMing.  
---
Pretty frustrating story :c
---
Let it not discourage you
---
Your hip is going to get sideways and that fucks with your whole body.
---
Yeah I think so... I was confused how old school players; even though I was called a WotLK baby really enjoy Classic WoW and it makes sense since probably most didn’t over kill it like me
---
*criesinlvl2magelvl7druidlvl8warriorandlvl18warlock*
---
yeah but when you ge documents you get the in game "book" pages to read from, nothing like what's displayed here !
---
Why are you posting this to reddit and not the blizzard forums?
---
I don’t understand why rant posts addressed to blizzard are showing up here. 
---
If anyone is wondering if this is the right place let’s just say this, no one gives a shit about your rant.
---
There was nothing smart or smug about it. Get off your high horse and fuck off. I answered his question as he asked it.
---
wow dude get a life
---
Default Blizzard raid frames, you can activate them in 5-mans as well and other than healing predictions (which is a pain to set up in any case) it does the job with minmal hassle.
---
But do you think it would be worth to use 5 gold to respec back to single target? It's quite a bit of gold for me rn
---
Check this out. USAF. You can work in a classified SECRET area which doesnt allow pretty much anything with wireless capabilities, wifi, phones, bluetooth devices, cameras of any sort ect.
---
But in that work center there are still workstations that are on the UNCLASSIFIED network.
---
Also my office for example used to be a COMSEC vault so no wireless signals of any kind are getting in because it is a large faraday cage basically. But I still have a regularly UNCLASSIFIED internet connection.
---
The only thing that really gets blocked are games and porn.
---
People are the same, faction does not matter.
---
IF I can heal 5 man content as a feral druid - you can do it as a shadow priest &lt;3
---
IT'LL HAPPEN TO YOUUUUUUUUUU
---
I really like this feeling of just being in an area and enjoy it for what it is, the atmosphere, the quests/lore, collecting a few minerals, to learn the continent geography.
---
I am only lvl 15 with some jobs a little up but I am hesitating to reroll from Gnome Mage to Gnome Warlock cause I played Mage in retail in Legion, still my fav I think but to change and I love Void pet and to change the skin for an other that I like.
---
I think I can, one week holidays in 1.5h.
---
Grab two other AOE mages and spam dungeons. Fastest leveling
---
Just use Leatrix Maps, best map addon I ever tried :)
---
Hi, /u/Homerlncognito

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d0ghly/friends_play_on_a_full_pvp_server/).
---
For a start picking alliance is just wrong.
---
If you you litteraly just want to be effective I thi k you should respec to whatever you consider as questing spec. Yes you are missing some mage potential but the current state of the game won't allow you to have the spots available for you. So the first tops the latter in efficiency Id say
---
this is amazing congrats
---
Wait, why are Shaman supposed to be saddened by that? I get giddy any time I get to have WF totem. I love my Shaman brethren.
---
You have to get on the zeppelin from the towers which are guarded.

Lol I spent 2 hours trying to establish a group for a simple SM Cath run - you are full of shit.

This is still true, even in retail. Maybe even worse...

"I have all of the map revealed, why do I still not have the achievement?" \*walks into a tiny corner and gets the ding\*  
---
Also, you've been playing the expansion for the past 7 months. You have the whole map revealed, yet flying over this one mountain in Zandalar and suddenly you discover a new area... pretty sure I've actually been there before, too!
---
I dont kill for honor i kill for fun.
---
&gt; Why can't I transfer to a specific realm?

There should be quests leftover for you in Redridge, Wetlands, and maybe some in Duskwood. You really don't have to consider leaving these zones until you're level 30. Make sure you've completed the Dun Algaz Gauntlet, visited the excavation site in Wetlands, completed the Jitters questline and Graveyard Camp (very northwest side of Duskwood). Also make sure you have done the Tower of Ilgalar quest in Redridge, there is a very memorable encounter. I believe the gnolls drop the item that starts it. 
---
Around level 30 you can start with STV or run out to the Shimmering Flats.
---
I guess I said "only" because more than half of my guild is 50+ already.
---
The earlier the better imo, just make sure your choice is what you actually like doing !
---
Oh you've never heard of joining someone's party? That's just sad, it's a pretty basic concept.
---
You can not. Although I did see the other day, an Alliance mage casting polymorph on a Horde warrior in between pulls, to help him fully heal. (Polymorphed opponents rapidly heal).
---
That and helping each other kill elites. But you'll have to do everything twice. Ideally you play on the same faction.
---
You should go wand spec to start then all shadow for leveling.  You can heal anything all the way to 60 as shadow.  Remember priest isnt a hybrid class you are a pure bred healer so you need to buff your damage as much as possible to be able to solo.

I've been on reddit hearing about how horrible it is and decided to see for myself. He seems like a perfectly good streamer, very entertaining storytelling and interacts with chat a lot. I don't know if he's amazing at the game but he seems knowledgeable about it and doesn't deserve the crazy amount of hate he gets.
---
He texted me so I had my phone up and then noticed him. So I just instinctively took a picture to send him on my phone. It was literally just a button press lol.
---
All good mate!
---
That would be awesome! Maybe we could pester Blizz into doing that...
---
Do not underestimate the power of bread in classic, *especially* the masochistic warriors. Lol.
---
Real MVPs know about it but don't do anything
---
Wow kids these days sure are retarded. Wow might get sub-sub-sub-sub-sub famous to 3 people on a app where everyone is anon wow sounds funny....
---
Having a world chat channel out of commission for a week is literal bs just because 1 person is a cunt
---
A life full of quality screenshots and i'm sold.
---
True. Fashioncraft.
---
That’s nice and all but why didn’t you print screen?
---
I think this may have something to do with the timer on rage/energy ticks. ive noticed if I catch it right when I shift into cat(with 5/5 furor) I’ll have 60 energy instead of 40.
---
Its time to go level or farm in peace, in a week the server will get more populated, and you will be back in business.
---
Nay just fucking stop trying to retail up Classic.
---
I don’t know how many people use it but there’s an add on that does that.
---
If you still take requests I'd like to see Patchwerk EU-DE (PVP). Thanks!
---
if you not running sword specialization it doesnt matter what you have in main/offhand except the offhand weapon should be a lot faster than your mainhand (because of poison). 
---
In my opinion you got a lot more options if you run sword in main hand because there are plenty of new upgrades in your leveling process. 
---
Actually I run sword in main and dagger in off hand and it feels ridiculous overpowered :D
---
The correct way is whatever way you enjoy, which OP is doing.
---
(Playing they way they enjoy) witch is the correct way.
---
I think a group finder would be a good idea for me anyway. I'm bored of questing by myself. I ask in the guild I'm in and in general chat for people to quest with and just get ignored. Would be nice to have an intergrated way to find people that just want to level and quest together
---
If it wasn't every priest before... now it will be.
---
So I can switch between servers with the same character? Like questing on one server, then play with my friends on the one they're playing on?
---
Good, it will put things back into proper balance. Increased prices will mean that you make and spend more on trades. However, you will take less of a financial hit when dealing with things like mounts and skills. Layering makes it harder for most people to make profit compared to actual vanilla wow.
---
The quest  to get the dark iron key is what you are thinking of. The dorf on the tomb in the middle of the chained pillar that you wrap around to get down to BRD
---
Check wowinterface, I believe I saw it on there.
---
Ah yes, can't forget that one. This only applies to non-raid mobs though. Or if it would save your life.
---
Yup. All a 1.6 bow is going to get you is a fat ass arrow bill
---
What level are you? Bazil is level 29 so I assume that’s the level of the quest. The chain leads to an awesome ring reward and some decent xp.
---
Unsubscribe from Basketball Facts.
---
Correct, according to blizzard. The screens of banks full of crystals were faked. Blizzard confirms they would view such behavior as an exploit, though, and not whatever it is you were trying to claim it as.
---
I thought he did the same thing when power leveling in WoD.
---
Names remind me of that MST3K episode.  Buff Drinklots, Butch Deadlift
---
Internal research to determine viability, PR, Server costs, etc. There is more costs then a couple developers porting an engine. This gets an entire team and diverts resources from other proven successful products. Meanwhile this is still a toss up, and could end up being break even or a loss.
---
*Laughs in intercept*
---
Yea I mean if my job was to play wow, I'd definitely keep my work char and personal char separately. It seems like he doesn't have a good work/life balance and despite all his earnings that's a little sad.
---
I aint no snitch thats why jesus QQ
---
Don't know why people are freaking out about this. There are other very lucrative money grinding spots pre 40 for mount gold.
---
One of the many I know about is badlands rock elementals. Should be around lvl 36 to effectively grind the spot by horde base. They drop 1-4 vendor trash per kill that all sells for multiple silver. They drop elemental earth which sells for 50s-1g each and will sell for 4+g once economy settles. They also drop 12 slot bags which on my server go for 3.50-4.50g each. On top of it all, they also drop rocksalt which sometimes sell very well on auc, sometimes just vend it. I had 21g to my name and grinded a full level on them. At the end I had 4 12 slot bags plus 2 to sell. Around 20 elemental earth, 20-30g in vendor trash etc. I sold the earth, every one of them, for 1g each. I sold each bag for 3.25.
---
1lvl - 46.5g on the low end. Was maybe 1 1/2 hours grind.
---
Nice. I did something similar. I mostly did graveyard pickpocketing and tried to go for the courtyard chest if it spawned. Didn't know you didn't have to reset to pickpocket. Good to know! Once I reached instance cap I just went to swamp of sorrows or dustwallow marsh and farmed beast i could skin (raptors in dustwallow and jaguars in the swamp). They drop good grey items along with the occasional green. Grinded 38-40 this way. Tiresome, but worth it!
---
Can you use raid frames in a party without coverting to a raid group?
---
So humans should go for swords or mace if they can choose?

I'm still fuckin pumped about this guy in Org yesterday that just randomly ran up to me and gave me some level white level 17 shoulders while I was still level 14. I can't wait to put those bad boys on.
---
The average level definitely isnt that high i would say low 20s
---
34
---
Make sure you’ve got 5 points in the spirit regen and wand talents and then: shield, mind blast, pain, wand. Concentrate on one mob which should give you your mana back for a new shield, heal and then repeat on the next mob.
---
bloodsail buccaneers!
---
Leather working progresses into making mail for Shamans and Hunters after 40, as well as leather for Rogues and Druids.
---
I hope your not serious
---
Most people are older now with a family, less time to commit, so they rolled a healer or like you said priest specifically. Priests are overpopulated right now but they are always wanted so it may balance out. The game will always be lacking in tanks, that is where the true need is at.

joue sur kronos, c'est tout simplement la meilleure des solutions, selon moi. blizzard a detruit toute chance d'avoir une experience satisfaisante sur les serveurs officiels
---
Moral of the story: if you see what looks like a game breaking exploit being done by someone, don't say anything and assume it's fake. Don't bring it to the company's attention because there's a chance you could be wrong.
---
Tbh i'm enjoy quests at now, but i like the idea of "natutal growing character", this is the reason of why i'm thinking in professions xD (to level up with my character level)
---
The respec cost does start to drop over time following your last respec so if it's something you think you can use then by all means try it out.
---
Warlocks are op as hell, all you have to do is cast fear and then dot up the target. Fear doesnt break on dot damage so you can fearlock someone to death, you can even make them run into mobs if you are lucky.
---
Isn't there a healing spec that just spams rank one mid flay to get the debuff?
---
But not like *a* casual.
---
Is there an addon or setting that shows your healing amount over the person you heal (the way damage is shown when you hit an enemy, on the character itself rather than only in their character bubble)?  For some reason this is bothering my friend and he wants to see the numbers on screen when he heals me.  And of course I want to make my pocket healer happy.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d0gpn2/is_there_an_addon_for_warriors_that_plays_a_shout/). 
---
The entire argument you put forward was that this was going to cause the destruction of the economy and people would be able to get items without having to work at them due to an exploit in the layering system? Nobody has done that.
---
Common misconception, but proven false.
---
Good good. I rerolled a warlock this week and I am 24 - was 40 on my rogue go figure but anyway.. This gives me hope things will get better.
---
The problem is, how things won't get better:
---
people getting frustrated and spreading the bad. people need to just encourage people to roll here and be patient.
---
Then you're just as bad, proving my point. You make the classic community look like trash
---
Welcome to Vanilla mate.
---
Some people just find tasteless jokes funny for their own sake. I used to, 15 years ago.
---
Explain?
---
yes but its very rude to roll against someone who is mainspec when you are rolling offspec.  you should stop doing that.
---
Bro, this is Reddit
---
What did you expect?
---
It didnt go over his head, this is a stupid circlejerk activision and blizzard have been one company for ~15 years and before that it was viviendi
---
I guess I'll have to test it out myself, but I'm not seeing how shadow is more mana efficient. Spirit tap + spiritual guidance should boost the damage of holy fire + a single smite to the point where you could wand the target down as your mana recovers. And if you're grinding, spirit tap will always be up.
---
The +hit for shadow is nice, I forgot about that. But mathematically I think 10% reduced resist (shadow) and +5% crit chance (holy) wind up being equivalent in the long run.
---
Again, I haven't leveled a priest in many years, and my current guy know is just level 20. I'll have to experiment when the time comes.
---
Thanks for the discussion though!
---
Yup I tried addons but the blitz raid frames + mouse over macros were the most efficient though I noticed mouse buttons don’t work on the frames itself
---
My life turned out better than I hoped it would at the time...  I guess I'm very lucky
---
Wait is that kiwi I see?? Fellow corrugator?
---
Legitimate question, why though?
---
Thank you! The day itself will be great but God dam the planning is a pain.
---
Do you think people are actually finding new layers to go to everytime they send a message in global begging? I think you need to try layer hopping yourself to see how they actually work. At worst, people can be changing layers after they scan a zone for rare resource nodes, finding none, and then moving on to another layer. Which sure, it shouldn't exist, but really isn't a problem. Using it for thorium respawns, or for a quest mob respawn is just a waste of your time.
---
But not every DH gets glowy eyes. They have to be chosen so theyre taking a huge risk

You really dont need to expend flat and a second mind blast bro. I also shield pre fight.

i dont play this game, can someone explain what i am seeing..it is like a really really old game from a cereal box. this cant be what youre playing, right?

Warrior (any specific spec) is one of the hardest things to level in vanilla wow.
---
Its possible lot of warriors are behind the levelling curve.
---
ALso possible lot of people rerolled at level 20 lol.
---
Can we PLEASE stop with these posts about gear rolls like the game hasn't been out for fifteen fucking years?

Don't listen to this loser lol. Definition of internet troll. Great post, made me laugh!

---
But it’s not. Random pugs are always need to valuable pieces.
---
Same thing with enhance sham. Its hard to dps with them in raids since shock spells generate soooo much threat. Earthshock even has an added threat generation effect.
---
Lol, the NINJA! if you don't know someone and you trade with them under promise they'll give you the items back because you cant wait 1 hour to mail 6 slot bags to yourself you did it to yourself.
---
On my pvp server people sort of try to ignore each other while questing but if our shoulders rub we’re fighting over the quest area.
---
Not at the PC right now, can't test myself - but there's an unlock button at the top which allows you to move them. Not sure if you can move them away from the edge of the screen but it's worth a shot!
---
Pretty sure it doesn't crit. I think the way the image is cropped made it look like the numbers were crits to me. My fault.
---
It's a sex number!
---
I did the same thing and ended up rerolling on my last 2 days. Had a 33 rogue. Sent all my big bags and 25 g to my priest got my enchanting to 150 first aid to silk bandages and skinning back up. Lev 18 now no regrets im just enjoying the game.
---
I wonder who in Blizzard thought it would be a great idea to market their Chinese mobile knock off to hardcore western PC gamers
---
Do explain kind sir.
---
Wanted to move my career forward, move to Denver, get married, have a baby. Did all of those things and then some......
---
Big difference. PvP is not enabled by default in contested zones, making leveling much easier as a result. Back in vanilla we called them “carebear” servers but I think the stigma faded a long time ago. It’s worth the experience leveling on a PvP server at least once, faction pride is stronger there in general. For a lot of people like me who did their time on a PvP server in vanilla, once was enough. Great experience with lots of bumps and some epic battles with the other faction, but a lot of griefing from lowlifes with nothing better to do than pick on people 10-20 levels beneath them.
---
Yesterday, I rand into a random person questing and we joined up. Quested for about 3 hours together. Halfway through we see this guy afk, getting mauled slowly by a mob.  So we spent a few minutes healing him, and then deciding whether we should kill the mob and let him live or just watch him die like two psychopaths.   
---
We killed the mob after laughing maniacally for a few minutes. The guy was low on health and came back from afk, and charged another mob and died.  He obviously didn't realize his health was low.  Neither of us told him that we spent the last 10 minutes deciding if he should die or not.  
---
I laughed so hard I knocked the drink off my desk when he got smooshed by another mob....
---
Lol. If you play softcore non of the bugs matter really, you lose nothing but few minutes of time if they happen. And hardcore economy is dead at 3-5weeks, so good luck playign there then if you are looking to trade.
---
i was being ridiculously charitable, giving greens to other players and passing in dungeons and really all it did was get me broke.
---
it's cause they were too high level. I tried to Mc a 42 warrior five times before I read the tooltip
---
Yes, yes it is, so is killing other players who are questing or grinding, so I must ask you, when do you PvP? Must we /bow before we fight? Must we wave before we fight?
---
Problems? Because if you're crying now this early and you're on a Pvp server you might as well reroll for PvE, where you can tag yourself and Untag yourself to show a willingness to fight, think they call that "Warmode" in BFA.
---
Priest is great, so much Goodwill from other players and easy to group for dungeons
---
Group finder isn't in retail bro. Or if it is its not what I am referring to (wouldn't know)
---
Dude wait for 3 sunders
---
I'll give blizzard the benefit of the doubt (daring, I know) and say one of their main reasons for reworking talents was due to how large the "tree" style was getting. WotLK trees were getting pretty big and bloated. Imagine if they'd kept the same style all the way up to today. Those trees would be stupidly long, and with many more classes being added since, the effort to reasonably balance everything would have required a whole seperate division of designers on the WoW team lol
---
Both systems have their ups and downs. Err.. I mean.. RETAIL BAD
---
If you turn them all in the total is around 7k if I remember correctly so really good!
---
the most successful in a dying genre, not the hardest achievement, its not the 90's or 2000's anymore, not alot of competition.  Also yet to post a link, so until then i wont be touching those comments anymore.
---
2. and you said the MMO part of a MMORPG is modifier, when its literally a large portion of the interaction of a game if you partake in it or not.
---
3. Do you have a link where it says it was designed to be multiboxxed? because no we are just going full circle and id like to redirect you back to my very first post again were we will copy and paste our answers ad infinitum.
---
Dude your whole leg stands on that blizzard is a god that dictates opinion and can determine if multi-boxing is indeed aligned with the core of what it is to play a MMO......your the one moving goal posts and if your gunna make those accusations atleast post some proof, which this far in you still have not.... so even your so called "authority" has yet to be even proven of your own accusation. 
---
You make all these posts on blizzard behalf but until you can prove that is what blizzard actually claims, everything and anything you posted has absolutely 0 merit.

Don’t go back to kill those Murlocs in Redridge. It’s not worth it.
---
Show us on the doll where the mean loladin hurt you :(
---
Slow and steady wins over charging right in! 
---
Use charge when you know theres not other mobs be in aggro range.
---
Try to only level in areas where you are 1-3 levels above the mobs, we warriors all learn what it feels like to miss several hits in a row and then die.
---
Try to run dungeons in order to get gear, especially new 2h weapons. And don't be afraid to use that 2h in the dungeons, especially at lvl 36+!
---
The best spec for leveling is the arms tree, when you get sweeping strikes at level 30 you can deal a lot of damage in dungeons and kill mobs 2 at a time while questing.
---
I roll need on everything because I disenchant it for mats. &gt;_&gt;
---
But I do try and wait for everyone else to roll. If someone else needs it, I pass. I try not to take actually upgrades.
---
I hoped on an RPPVP sever for a few minutes just to check it out. It's one of the new ones so was pretty dead but just based on the names I saw running around I realized I mine as well just go back to a regular sever.
---
A little more complete answer:
---
It has the fastest attack speed. This is useful for PvP, because it’ll hit a caster more times while they’re casting a spell, which will make the spell take longer to cast.
---
Since it attacks faster, each hit does less damage than normal cats. So it does the same dps. Some people say you can save a talent point, that has not been proven to be the case.
---
This is what I love of classic wow. I've been jumping ship since LastDawn (~2007) and I have started on so many servers that, for one reason or another, closed: Enturion, Spidernet, Forsake gaming, Emerald Dream and so on.
---
Having finally a place that is here to stay... Is priceless!
---
That smile. *That damned smile.*

Try Clique, I use that instead of mouseover macros (basically the same thing but in an addon format and easier to set up IMO).
---
Nice man I am too on Kirtnos! I'm level 22 now
---
I started deadmines as 17 so 20 is fine.
---
In unable to use staves. Possibly a later game talent like wearing leather armor idk.
---
Pick up holy fire if you want to do damage but if your mainly healing dont worry about it.
---
Also pick up enchanting! I make a lot of money making wands through that.
---
Good luck fellow dwarf!

I'm OorL here, knew it was a troll but I'm not getting the context

I cant speak for the other poster but sometimes traditional AC simply is not a tenable solution for your particular work environment, particularly in warehouse work (since larger volume of space = exponential increase in work for cooling). At my place of work they have to constantly circulate fresh air in from the outside due to air quality concerns inside the plant, and the machines put out a generous amount of heat themselves. AC in these conditions really just isnt possible.
---
They keep powerful fans, swamp coolers, and misters spread out around the workstations as a stopgap and supply water and gatorade to the guys on the floor. There's also an air conditioned break room to go eat lunch. It still sucks in the dead heat of the summer, but I think I prefer it over being a desk jockey. I find actual work on a computer absolutely mind numbing.
---
Yea, I am thinking cool-downs is the main one, but that's mostly PVP.  I'll keep my eyes out, thanks for input!

Yes. That is what I said.
---
Which server?
---
For Solo and a Little bit faster leveling. Hunter is a good choice. Rogue also has some Benefits. But Overall when it Comes to more solo Play Hunter is better imo. 
---
DPS in Groups or Raids - Rogues are pretty good

Yeah so you get 1 sac.. The post says he has succubus out already.

I rolled to open a chest and got a 10 slot bag from it and the guy that lost pretended I gave him something as compensation 😆,  also while questing in the wetlands a druid approached me and traded me green shoulders asking for 50 silver out of the blue 🤣,  . I also got great experiences but those two made me laugh so hard.
---
That’s not how it down on my server!
---
Okay??? Just make your own private channel and tell people to join. Call it world2.   
---
You cant complain about someone gaining ownership of a private channel.  Our server uses a channel called "lfg".
---
I guess I would be around 40-50 now if I didn't play with friends all  the time, they're around lvl 22-23 now and I've only lvled up like 2 lvls this week because all of my focus has been helping them in Deadmines, doing random questing etc.
---
But they're up to speed soon and we'll do stuff I need as well like SFK and Stockades :)! I just enjoy  the game too much with friends now.
---
But I guess me and my GF will start playing our alts a bit when they're offline.

Haha there's a Russian church in my town and the pastor looks pretty close to this lol. Your character still looks pretty cool though. It tough to get armor that seems to go together.
---
I decided to level DISC and I love it. Enchanting my own Greater Magic Wand with the Wand Specialization hits like a truck. Improved Power Word: Shield -- Mind Blast -- Shadow Word: Pain -- Greater Magic Wand. I'm level 20 and still able to pull 2-3 mobs. I don't have quite the raw healing output in dungeons, but that improved bubble is such a savior when we make pulls that are a little too big.
---
Rogues can stealth in for chest kills, quest items and are fun with a higher skill cap.
---
Hunters can solo more (imo) and less limited by solo play than a rogue. 
---
What do you have in mind? End game content? PvP? PvE?
---
pretty simple, those only grinding dungeons to level dont like player interaction as much as those that primarily level in the open running quests and SM is the meta for leveling as far as I know. 
---
Retail attitudes dont mix well with classic gameplay.
---
Nesingwary’s?
---
I used to play with this lady who was addicted 100%. 
---
She would come online at 8am every day and not log out until midnight. Her son struggled with school(likely because she spent very little time helping him at home), she had health issues from sitting around all the time, and her only income was disability and food stamps.
---
After defeating the lich king in wotlk she quit cold turkey. I called her one time and asked her to play on a private server with me and she said that she had to go to counseling to quit wow and she can never touch the game again. She asked that I not bring up wow in conversation with her because it was tempting. 
---
Anyway moral of the story.....if wow takes priority over friends and family in your life stop playing because that's the #1 sign of addiction and all addictions cause harm to your future goals and asspirations.
---
I relate so damn hard dude.
---
Lol idiot.. it’s not dig hard.. it’s obviously armageddon..
---
i completely agree the drop rates seem insane.  guildies are constantly linking blues in chat and we've had a few epics already and people aren't even 60 yet.  I've spent literal years of my life on vanilla and NEVER had an epic world drop, now people are getting them in no time??
---
and in dungeons every second mob seems to drop a green, it's WAY above normal for that
---
meanwhile nodes and quest drops are super rare
---
WoW's communities can grow incredibly strong. The guild I joined in 2005 still exists to this very day, although prior to Classic, none of ujs played WoW anymore. Some years ago we officially registered a club (it's called "e.V." in Germany) and we meet every year to socialize, talk about gaming and about how everything has changed during the years. Most of us are parents by now. I even met my wife in this guild. We try to help each other in different kinds of life situations because we all have so many different professional qualifications. It's so invaluable that WoW has brought all those beautiful people to my life.
---
Honestly, we should call it WoW.
---
The real World of Warcraft was the alliance we ganked along the way.
---
Ah sorry I wasn't aware that is the name of an addon. Will check that out, thanks!
---
I'm a level 19 Nelf druid, kind of hitting a plateau, I seem to have completed all the quests in Darkshore. And quests seem to be pushing me to Ashenvale but in my opinion that's just a level or two above what's safe for me. Should I just grind mobs until then? Also, unrelated, what professions would benefit a young druid such as myself?
---
/spit
---
You make it sound like WoW was the issue in these scenarios. The issue was/is with the players and if it wasn’t WoW it would be something else. 
---
Gaming and having friends and family, work and other hobbies, it happens every day for most of us.
---
If you sit like that (either ankles crossed or leg over another) your hip isn't straight. You got muscles/nerves running through your whole body, one will get a bit shorter than the other.
---
When do Hunters learn how to tame boats? That sounds badass!
---
What's Blizzard going to do? Pull their game out of China? Go to one of the other companies that's also controlled by the government? Blizzard holds basically none of the power in that relationship.
---
Train staves from the weapon master in stormwind
---
Skills not high enough.
---
How the f do I split items ??
---
As a low level enhance shaman I feel a bit overpowered, I can simultaneously tank in dungeons if needed thanks to the shield, do relatively high damage if I use my fire totems correctly, and heal in a pinch if I conserve my mana properly.
---
On my priest when we pull i almost exclusively slap renew on the tank so i can dot and wand enemies. It helps loads with the dps / clear speed and unless it's a big pull i barely ever have to do anything outside of that renew.
---
The first guild I ever joined was because the guild master was in Goldshire when I first started and bought me a set of white mail gear from the vendor. Fast forward 8 years and I was still in that guild until it eventually collapsed and merged with another guild. He didn't even remember doing that for me, but I still do today.
---
The things we do for low levels echo throughout their entire lives on wow, and it really is what makes MMOs special.
---
We should have received Goblins as the neutral race instead of pandas.
---
My first toon was a Rogue.   I remember running WC as my first dungeon and 'needing' every item that dropped.   The entire group was so angry with me, and I didn't even notice the chat window.   We were probably 3/4 of the way through the dungeon before I saw the chat window and apologized and learned the difference in need vs greed.    Good times.
---
Iirc this was not bannable. Exploiting a bug to use fear and clip people into the water was.
---
Dudes a retail troll ignore him.
---
i found like ten of them! thank you so much.
---
Sure, that's why even just opening the advanced graphics menu magically fixes the problem for about 2 minutes till the FPS drop again.
---
.hack is pretty good but it's a bit slow paced.
---
Pleaser do this Blizzard.  Please don't take the easy way out and just do BC and Wrath.
---
Been looking for an addon that does it. Seems like there currently is no way to do that, unfortunately :(
---
Many quests have a level requirement. If you are using a questing mod it may show the quest with a level req next to it on your map. If you are below that requirement the NPC with the quest will have a silver "!" over their head indicating you need to be a higher level.
---
Pridelord!
---
Yes!
---
15 years ago, that was my Hunter's pet. And I didn't see \*anyone\* with him at all ever until a solid year later. I loved that lion so very much. Called him Pride.
---
This ^
---
Not an MMO show.
---
And yet your heart had hit the gold cap ♥️
---
1, you just need 10 silver.
---
that is actually me lol. but i found them all in floating wreckage on the coast of STV. amde a lot of money that day.
---
The realms can hold 15k online at a time from what we have been told. And the queues are up to 10-12k with a timer that means nothing because the system can’t calculate how long they will be online for. 
---
Generally the realms are unplayable unless you login hours early. If you want to avoid queue times new realms were launched such as earthfury. It is slower right now but will pick up it’s one day old. Has some 60s on it as well.
---
/rolleyes
---
I had a lv 58 rogue with me in STV, it was really funny watching rogs try to gank my 35 Hunter when another rogue jumped out on them.
---
Can't argue with that.
---
The Mommaception really got to me. Do we have to call our momma's Silverwind now?
---
THE same thing can be said about soda. The fucking idiot had the audacity to make 2016 wow rant video and talk about everything that retail is bad for and continue to do those things in classic (dungeon farming to max level)
---
now i am not an asmongold dick rider, i dont watch him often, but when i did watch him i did not notice him bashing retail at any point, he was saying nothing more or less then what we already knew. I dont blame them for items and gold, what ever, streamer benefits, what i do blame them is about leveling, what was the point, you crying for legacy servers. and then do the same thing you ranted about. 
---
WoW Classic was about WORLD, they said the "world" of warcraft element was lost in retail because of flying etc. And when they got the chance to experience the "world" of warcraft after 15 years, they ruined it. and with that lost all my respect.
---
BUT NOT ONLY THEM ARE IN THE WRONG, THE FAT PRICK ESFAND, HE EVEN USES FUCKING LEVELING ADDONS WHICH IM EVEN MORE PISSED ABOUT. 
---
Disappointed in every single one of them.   
---
I will see you in Towelliee's chat everyone the og of the og's
---
You say activision but blizzards own ion is what ruined retail wow.
---
You are right, DPS needs to allow tanks to gain threat before going all in, they can wand, or use auto attacks/ single target shots to put damage in. But this ain't retail tanks have to earn the threat.
---
What if they just started TBC servers where your had the option to port your character from Classic to? This way the worlds would stay separated.
---
I use twitch because I like how easy it is to update the addons. There's an "update all" button, I just wait.
---
I'd recommend an addon that can tell you which quest item to pick based on vendor price, sometimes it's a real difference. Auctioneer does this (but it also shows A LOT of things I don't care about)
---
Also the addon that shows enemy mob HP (don't know the name, sorry).
---
I play an hour everyday on the train like this. I get some stares but it's honestly the best time to do all the crafting and city stuff so I can spend my time at home concentrating on the adventure at hand.
---
What if it will cost me ten gold :(?
---
THIS is what Classic was about, and why people lined for its return. The world is new again, and the sense of community has been rekindled. Gear actually matters, and epics don’t rain from the sky. Hopefully blizz learns from this and applies what they’ve learned in retail going forward.
---
Zeppelins are even better. Fall damage and mobs mean a chance of death and a repair bill.
---
Right now with both Auctionator and TSM you have to manually scan, but TSM is working on the desktop app scan and should be working without a week.  TSM is vastly superior to Auctionator, but ideally you should use both for different scenarios.  Just be sure to disable tooltips in Auctionator settings, or you'll get duplicate information from both addons on items tooltips.
---
Since classic wow came out, I broke up with my girlfriend and pulled a full-on all nighter without sleep until the next night for the first time since college.
---
^^Ok ^^the ^^breakup ^^was ^^coming ^^anyway ^^and ^^I ^^have ^^problems ^^sleeping
---
Thanks. So it seems doing solo content will be hard in any build. I guess I can party with someone.
---
That isn't an Isekai and it isn't about MMO's. More about the internet in general.
---
Top of Org bank is really comfy.
---
Why? This gave me no reason not to.
---
Soon it will be taking an hour or two to fill one bar of experience.
---
Have you ever considered that maybe people are asking for the layer swapping without considering if it's really doing anything or knowing how/if it works at all? People bandwagon on things, that's why everyone is AOE farming right now despite the fact that for most people just questing and killing mobs while moving from place to place is still going to be the faster approach, because that's how the world first got there. What people constantly say has almost no bearing on whether or not it is an issue or not.
---
They could be complaining about the "current" retail/bfa engine (also used by classic) performing poorly.
---
I am just repeating what I've read and seen on tests that say bite is higher DPS, more efficient and frees up focus for other abilities. You can always use claw as a dump manually.
---
In universe are these just overgrown briarthorns?
---
Am I getting scammed? I bought three bags using Cash on Delivery for 1g 30s. However, when the mail was received, it showed that each bag was 1g 30s. I am scared to accept and pay the whole amount for only one bag.
---
Storm wind also has a trainer. Woo ping I think.
---
Co u can do all realm firsts ..
---
My bad, Classic Aura Durations.
---
If I were you, trying to decide between hunter and rogue, I'd go hunter, all the way.
---
1. Better at Solo play
---
2. Feign Death.  (I main a Hunter in Retail, you have no idea how useful this ability is!)
---
3. despite the commonly accepted belief that hunters are sub-par dps, they are not!
---
Spend 4 fucking years trying to get the same mounts and contemplate just killing myself every time I don't get the drop...I'm too dedicated now tho.
---
That’s why I roll multiple characters. When things like this happen and I can’t avoid it I’ll log into a different character and just play them for a few hours. It usually solves itself by then
---
I'm alliance and was over in Wailing Caverns a few days ago... The local horde were saving my cloth ass from being gangbanged by the elite mobs along the way. Made me quite happy.
---
Yeah. Regret mentioning group quests now as that's getting all the focus. It was mainly used to form Dungeon groups.
---
On alliance, look out for the Defias Brotherhood quest at sentinel hill. On the horde, you’ll get one for RFC from somewhere
---
I don't like using far away keys either, so what I've been doing for a few years now is to move the movement keys from 'wasd' to 'esdf'. Seems weird at first, but after a few hours of play you don't even notice anymore. That way you can use 'qwa' and 'rtg' and about 2-5 for spells.
---
Usually head back to a hub city, mess around in the auction house, update my crafting skills if they need to be updated, that sort of thing.  Might go for a stroll through a lower level area if I need to level herbalism a bit or something.
---
Need

Open it and roll for the contents

Oh I didn’t know they are a quest item.  Must be Warlock unless I just haven’t hit that quest yet at level 34

Good to know, thanks!
---
In the end it's up to you, the server currently has 187 people online and during primetime it gets to roughly 700. Less then 1/3rd a Vanilla server from 2004.
---
Making room for me to play on Herod, it’s really appreciated :)
---
damn that sucks, on mine I get several mesages per day to heal SM aoe runs, people can't find priests it seems.
---
I've found /startattack is more reliable, not sure if there's actually a coding difference or if it's just in my head.
---
I downloaded the power hour ui, is there a way to swap skill bars with it? So I don’t have to move all my spells around when I dungeon heal then go back to solo lvling?
---
Um...more than 187 people transferred. Is that 187 in a zone? What is that info...
---
Within the first hour a /who in the barrens brought up 50+ characters...
---
In theory it will help, but not as much as you think. The spell coefficient for Blizzard is (unofficially) 0.33, meaning that the spell only gets 33% of the benefit from any bonus spell damage equipment you have, and this is spread over the full duration of the spell. So the +10 damage that Icicle Rod gives will actually provide about 3 more damage, divided over the entire 8 seconds. So effectively it won't help you.
---
DPS doesnt go to shit. It just takes more effort than other classes to compete and doesny scale as well with gear compared to a warrior, for instance.
---
I disagree. Most players pass by peacefully, and only about 50% of ganks are successful for the ganker. I keep the list for the other 50% assuming the ganker was higher level and had no real reason to kill me.
---
Druids are the 3rd best at solo content usually. It’s usually Hunter&gt;=Warlock&gt;Druid. Druid can stealth past mobs, heal themselves, CC/Kite, and tank. It’s just slow DPS
---
It does technically, but spells like blizzard don't benefit a lot from +damage. You're pretty much always better off opting for items with stats at lower levels. You will need the INT for AoE'ing far more than a little damage.
---
I mean by that logic it's impossible for a company to be transparent without making their code open-source, so good luck on that one.
---
"Be the change you want to see in azeroth" that statement should be plastered all over this subreddit. I bought a green cloth helm off of ah but I didn't have one yet at level 40 and was so happy that I message the guy who crafted it and said thank you, they then thanked me for making them smile and making their day. Be the change you want to see in azeroth
---
So, do you want to heal at lvl 60?
---
Gearing for end-game starts around lvl 50+ (lvl 55 and up mostly).
---
You could run dungeons as enhancement, rolling for the resto gear. Untill you have enough caster gear to run those dungeons as resto.
---
Have you ~~eaten~~ drank an elixir?
---
On the bright side, you can put a few of them to work helping you with your WW axe quest so you get it early on.  I got mine at lvl 31 which would have been impossible without help on farming the elementals and killing the final guy.  Luckily they're both near the same zone so it wasn't too hard to convince my higher guildmates for help with both.  Just get everything else done first :)
---
I like helping when i can but i also remember really well the 40 ppl raids and the toxicity and salt of those days. I played the game from beta to tbc and all i can hope for is that maybe after 15 years people have matured enough.
---
I was going to do this to a poor lowbie alliance, but a group of other hordies killed him after I told them not to. He respawned on the boat and as they ganked him again I MC'd him and brought him safely to booty bay without risk of death. Mess with my fun and Ill mess with yours.
---
Take a zeppelin to undercity, do quests there. Yiu can easy do lvl 12-13 doing them and then get back to barens.
---
Of course you can have more than one thing in your action bar. But this might save you space as you clump together certain spell combos in different macros.
---
All working as original
---
2-3 hours isn't abnormal in the 30s if you're questing or doing standard dungeon runs
---
It will be patched out shortly

You can, but you won’t get to complete any quests doing it. Also, Scholo and Strat are specifically limited to groups of 5.
---
Y'all are talking bout metal gear while I'm here thinking this ain't no thief game
---
This is exactly what I was looking for thanks so much! Just one last question - do you have a mage guide similar to the hunter one above? That was really informative compared to other stuff I’ve read
---
I ran deadmines at 15 and was able to keep the group alive, but mileage may vary depending on your group.
---
Yeah, they have a cloaca
---
Check the link at the bottom in my edit. the website as a section for warrior macros.
---
Eng/Tailoring for mage, Eng/Any for Hunter.
---
While leveling though I'd recommend just Skinning (or Skinning/Tailoring on Mage).
---
Pfffft, by the time WoW came on the scene I was in my 30s and my dreams were already crushed.
---
Eeeek!!!
---
Don't you dare!
---
Why stoneclaw instead of earthbind kiting?
---
I can't be the only one who thinks this is just mean. Sure there's world PvP, but then there's sheer dickishness.
---
Huh I seem to recall a video game with a similar description...
---
Yea the real pro gamer move is dumping them in the fatigued water so they can’t even swim to get their body.
---
When you right click a video in chrome (gotta double right click youtube videos I was told in comments), there's an option to put it in picture-in-picture. That's what I did. Works great!
---
Could you explain why this is bad. I'm new enough to the game that I don't know.
---
Look at his profile, he is an insanely prolific troll who is all over reddit.
---
Bats (and owls) have only slightly less Dps than cats, but hold aggro much better.  I've leveled several hunters to ~mid-50s on private servers and to 60 back-in-the-day on Live and boars have always been my favored solo leveling pets.  The charge gets them to mobs ASAP so you can unload, and can save you from being ganked if you're on a PvP server.
---
Personally my favorite pets are turtles and tallstriders, but I've got a soft spot for underdogs.
---
And then you have goobers that farm level 6 areas at level 20-30 for linen cloth, creating an issue for the multiple people that are trying to actually level. I get that people need to farm cloth for professions, but if you're tagging everything in an area and AoEing it down, leaving no chance for the lowbies trying to get quest drops, you can go suck a fuck.
---
This is a pretty pointless rant. I know people are going to people, and there are definitely more willing to help than hurt, but this has happened to me on 4 different characters in Elwynn Forest since I started playing. I just need to vent. :P
---
Pala buffs mana cost is op

You know we are in trouble when nobody cares about Top Gun...
---
only if you are taking it too seriously, he didnt stunlock and teabag you,  i would laugh after the initial wtf just happened

You can also use daggers. (I’m sure you know, just sharing for folk who see your post)
---
Elf's must be a sad life.
---
People become murders irl from alot less. This would make me go mad with rage.
---
That's exactly what I did and couldn't be happier with the decision. My time is much more valuable now than it was 15 years ago and I don't need it wasted by some 13 year old trying to get his rocks off. Battlegrounds will be a thing and I will be able to PvP on my own terms at that time.
---
I love how you don’t even read the chat on the picture and still have something to say.
---
You must be fun at parties :)
---
Read my other comment mate. I misread :)
---
Wetlands, Duskwood, also Stockades for 5-6 runs to get a level or 2 to beef yourself up
---
Okay, well an organized adventure without a physical world is far easier to "adapt to a party" than a virtual one where the landscape is static. It would be pretty dumb if a fresh level 1 could run into the burning steppes and kill dragons with cleavers, yet struggle against a board in Elwynn.  
---
Even with your proposed change, the end game rushers will ALWAYS exist. If they aren't rushing levels, they're rushing something else that people take their time with.    
---
It isn't about having a closed mind, it's about staying true to the genre and doing *what works.*
---
Lol some backwards ass logic. Cant prove youre not gay so therefor its fact... Thats how stupid you sound
---
Don't you dare move your arm.
---
I am anxiously waiting for these magical moments to happen when I run into good people.  Perhaps I picked the wrong server (the only non-PVP RP, Buccaneer), but so far my experience with those players in Dun Morogh have been less than stellar.
---
Too many times have I gone in, fighting a series of mobs that were guarding the quest item I am seeking (shimmer weed, tools, etc.) only to see a player literally standing there waiting for me to do all the work.... and then go in and take the items right after I pulled the final mob so I then have to wait for it to respawn. 
---
While the tools (thank goodness) respawn quick enough, the shimmer weed does not, especially with the tribe near the cave.
---
I have seen this a lot.  There have been times I am running up to a mob as a melee fighter, literally 5 steps away, and someone *then* pulls the mob from me with their range.  It was painfully obvious I was running directly to it.
---
There are always going to be bad apples in any server, but I have experienced more of these annoying encounters than the golden ones I keep seeing posted in this subreddit.
---
Again, maybe the RP server was a bad idea.
---
Faster is not always better, ask any woman.
---
Oh sorry that's not what I meant. In retail WoW, there's a character transfer service. You pay money and your character is PERMANENTLY moved to another server. Since the current servers on Classic are soooo overloaded, they offer this service for FREE but it's most like a one time deal. When I logged on yesterday, I had that option during queue. I chose to stay on Herod though.
---
If you and your friends agree to use this service while it's free, you can choose a server with lower population
---
Are there any big gear upgrades I should be looking to get from dungeons pre lvl 40? I prefer questing over dungeons but if there are any really massive improvements I'm more than happy to do a few dungeons to get something.
---
Right - makes no sense. We need people to roll there and not complain and help populate the server and support the server versus complain that no one plays there.
---
I got the one that goes from ratchet to booty bay. It’s a threat machine and you know goblins make things blast resistant
---
I should upload the video footage as I did save it with shadowplay lol
---
Of course Ally would do this. 
---
Scum.

100%. The past few years Ive been playing shooters somewhat competitively, so to switch to a game where I can sit down, have a beer or two, fully immerse myself and have fun is so refreshing and I too look forward to it everyday. Also, speaking of shitty drop rates... I got into a group for the elite quests in Southshore killing dwarves last night. For whatever reason the whole group got their quest item fairly quick except one person. We as a group literally sat there for an hour and a half slaughtering dwarves, chatting, laughing, until our last group-mate got his item(worst RNG Ive ever seen) - the camaraderie and dedication from everyone was beautiful. Ive fallen in love with this game  again even harder than before.
---
Faster OH weapon for faster poison application. It's why shamans or warriors (or hunters) don't really care about their off hand weapon speed.
---
But these rely a bit more on RNG drop.
---
Elvui has it built in
---
Are you on one of the Full servers? Seems like the elemental spot is always packed on my server.
---
I think it’d be a cool system to have even without any xp reward. That would help prevent abuse. Make the quest giver front any gold/item rewards. 
---
Even cooler would be to allow for players to place PvP bounties. Say 1st to kill Grogon the Orc Warrior gets 5g.
---
Too much light coming from that window. Needs curtains.
---
There's a setting in the game's interface settings or somewhere that says autoloot. Right click loots everything.
---
I put the shoot button (from skill book - press p) on an action bar and assigned a key to it, 'v' and just press it to shoot.
---
E) Open your quest log with L. Your quests are color coded by difficulty for your level.
---
Red = Too difficult for you to complete at your level/alone
---
Orange = Possible, but you will probably die a lot and your attacks will miss, and be dodged, parried, blocked, and resisted often.
---
Yellow = This quest is doable at your level.
---
Green = This quest will be easy for you to complete.
---
If all of your quests are orange and red, consider moving to a different zone in your level range. You can open your map with M and hover over the different zones on each continent to see their level ranges.
---
Robes of Arcana don't sell for a lot because people wear them, they sell for a lot because they're a needed item for warlocks to get their quest robe that's BiS for 10-15 levels depending on when you get it
---
How did you level fast? What build/guides are you following?
---
Imagine bitching about people making fun of their hometown npc while ours gets slaughtered 100+ times a day.
---
Oh it's guild groups running like that lol. It's super efficient and we don't wipe or anything so meh, but I'm really hoping strat and scholomance etc can't be run like that cause having to heal like I'm in the mdi at all times gets draining lol.
---
Good looks bro I was just gonna go herb and alchemy, you think go herb to when I’m 60 and skinning until I’m 60 then go alchemy? And I’ll def do those macros I didn’t even think of that and your right about the shield bash

I rolled Human Warlock because Diplomacy is more beneficial to me personally.  Sure I don't get the gnome 5% int boost but I've been in groups where gnome warlocks that are more geared did worst simply cause they did poorly at their rotation.

It’s so petty but absolutely hilarious at the same time
---
Oh wow you guys dide DM as horde? That's pretty cool. I always wanted to do RFC as Ally but that's definitely not happening in Classic lol
---
Wait to see if your group has a ninja, roll depends on the results.
---
Planning on using 2H for DPS and raiding, but why do I go fury as horde and not try to get mortal strike?
---
It makes it easier to maintain 100% uptime on Frenzy, which could save you a skill point or two.

Pick em all up, do them naturally as a grind around the area. When I'm done with a zone if there are any leftovers just ditch em and move on.

Once in a blue moon we healers get a mage who constantly steals aggro from the tank, pulls extra mobs, and in general just causes chaos all in the name of attempted fast runs. They end up taking a lot of damage and often PW:Shield is the only thing that saves them. Maybe your Priest just had one of those runs and was suffering from PTSD. ;)
---
That hand looks like it's about to smash the keyboard.
---
So much this.
---
Also, your momentum from jumping continues, regardless of how you turn in the air.
---
Adding these together means you can jump spin 360 and keep running.  Why?  Hunters and a few other classes have to face a target to cast a spell.  If you are running for your life or kiting, turning around or strafing slows you down and gives a chance for them to catch up.  Use your mouse to run, jump, spin with your mouse in the air and cast your ability while turned, then land and keep going.
---
It's really a beautiful moment when it works.  Being able to cast concussive shot or frost shock without pausing or slowing will save your life.
---
Am I an asshole for letting mage die after couple warnings ?
---
15 years later and I'm still annoyed that stitches is in Duskwood and not in Nax
---
yo, orc females hit different
---
Yea I’m seeing that now.  Poor warlocks
---
theres a lot of zone hopping, early 30s you can start stv and when the quests get too rough you can head somewhere else for a few lvls before coming back to do more stv stuff before heading elsewhere for a few lvls before coming back to finish stv. have you checked out shimmering flats or desolace? sorry im horde and not quite familiar with ally zones. i also had a rough go in my early 30s but it picked up in my mid 30s and i got to 40 in a breeze. itll get better hang in there
---
I killed this gnome in Ratchet yesterday who was *clearly* afk. Didn't even move or try to fight back. 
---
Dirty Alliance scum!
---
Nah its just assholes. People hit a big road block in the mid 30s and the gear in sm will carry you through the 40s. 
---
Unless you know which zones to quest in during your 30s it can suck
---
I think i went through zones that i didnt do and sold as much crafting materials and i got my mount in couple days and got to see some quests i havent before.
---
Hillsbrad maybe
---
You provoked that shit. Glad you got ganked.
---
Didn’t last census have warriors as most played class by a decent margin?
---
In this case faster is better. Leveling a warrior is pretty brutal. Miss miss parry parry dead
---
Loved mop
---
 loved the panderan
---
Hated loss of talent trees
---
Thanks buddy :)  
---
We all knew eachother and just did it for fun. Noone got their feelings hurt, noone felt they were unfairly treated. So to each their own. Honestly it was some of the most fun I had in the early levels, 5 people standing on a chest, spam clicking as fast as possible waiting for combat state to cease xD
---
This all day. If your not a fishing alchemist go elsewhere. These are my iron bound treasure chests and firefin pools
---
You lost me at "Zepplin to UC" Filthy horde
---
Well for one serpent sting sucks past and I pretty much never use it beyond level 20 or so. Damage to mana is better than arcane shot but only if the mob lasts full duration and even then I’d rather use a multi shot for faster kill. 
---
And are you using a cat or owl? If not that could be why. Boars do ok because their first hit is buffed with charge. Bears, raptors, gators, all suck nuts
---
just use adibags
---
Ah, okay thanks!
---
I realised after I posted this that there was lots of explanations in the comments and then felt dumb haha
---
photos taken seconds before disaster.
---
They deserve it. If you're on a boat and you see a priest of the opposite faction, it's time to go below or start pillaring like you're a resto druid in 2v2 arena.
---
Mind Control Horde off Freewind Post in Thousand Needles elevator ftw
---
I’ve never seen 3 ppl role the same number! That’s something I definitely wanna see
---
Yes priest has great leveling actually. The only required talents are wand specialization and spirit tap. Make sure to keep your wand as up to date as possible. Getting the one from BFD in your early 20s is amazing. Pull usually goes pw:s , then holy fire , sw:p , mind blast, wand until dead and use mind flay if they flee. Don’t need to drink between mobs. As far as professions go tailoring and enchanting are good. If you don’t want to do that then alchemy and herbalism are good as well.
---
Ideally 6+ shamans in todays meta. Every melee ground needs WF and casters tranquil. Swap to healers groups for mana tides.
---
Did you skim over the scouting report breadcrumb that tells you to start from the west side of the zone and the one that tells you there's more than one Satyr camp to get those horns?
---
The zone's not great for Horde (especially on a PvP server), but if you read the quests they warn you that trying to do what you did is a bad idea. :)
---
If you want to avoid Ashenvale and get sick of brown going Barrens -&gt; (Stonetalon -&gt;) 1kN, you can use the times you go back to town to train to swap back and forth between 1kN/shimmering flats and the undead areas.  Hillsbrad is a hoot.
---
I got a vive, I knew what was coming from a mile away MUHAHA
---
Those robes are the first in a Warlock quest chain that awards some pretty dope blue robes.
---
It's hard because you know the value of the mats at that level and you can't afford them. Even at the trash rates currently on the AH. On the other side the enchanter is just going to waste them over and over to maximize skill. You can't sell your skill at that level.
---
It's awesome to do. You feel good about helping and their white bracers now have a stat!
---
I play like +60 hours first week of the PoE leagues in hardcore and I have very little problems during those times and usually I don't even die till red maps to "overtuned league mechanics" and usually by my second char those are nerfed.
---
Quest or dungeon.
---
THIS. There is absolutely a learning curve to it, but once you have it down you will improve your gameplay *so much*.
---
People have to learn how to take screenshots. 
---
It's across all subreddits. If you take a pic/vid of your monitor with your phone you will be told off. 
---
Get better people, not sensitive lol
---
You can do a couple of quests there - Deliver a package.  Kill a crap load of spiders for their meat.  Kill two dozen wolves just because.  By the time you grind those out, you've gained a level or two and other Duskwood quests open up.  I bounced back and forth between Duskwood and Redridge for a while and in between ran Deadmines once or twice.  Doing that should get you some gear and another level or two to make later Duskwood and those Elite Orcs a little easier.
---
And don't be shy about groups.  You don't have to do everything yourself and those big quests are a lot easier and a lot more fun with two or more working together.
---
Maybe I'd do that if it were a photo to show off some nice zone or xmog but too much effort for me at 2am last night. Plus, it fits the theme lol. Slightly blurry and low quality photo for vanilla.
---
*Laughs in undead*
---
mmm the whole Shenna and Crogg fiasco.
---
Press print screen to take a screen shot, ctrl+v that shit in ms paint then save it. Alternatively you can print screen then find it in your wow screenshot folder under appdata.
---
it costs a lot of mana, man
---
I'm full AoE spec and only have 5/5 imp frostbolt. No problem killing any elites or tough quest mobs. You'll be fine.
---
Don’t worry she’s playing a ret paladin 😂
---
So... you rolled 100 and posted a picture of it??
---
I actually have /Lick macro'd. Just to confuse (and disgust) them.
---
I saw one guy spamming it on Kurinnaxx for a while and everyone told him to shut the fuck up and just play the game.
---
Yeah, it seems lots of people wants the retail experiencia: fast, easy and with no communication. You can see that when people ask +18 deadmines
---
Yes you can move and resize them in any way you wish.
---
Take a screenshot my god.
---
man I leveled a warrior to 60 in vanilla so I’m kind of embarrassed to ask, but why is slower better? Better with rock biter??
---
No, it isn't. 
---
You queue for the server, the layers reside on the same server. 
---
Layers split the player base, but they are still on the sam server.
---
Queue for server, then split into layer.
---
You don't go anywhere in life without taking risks. 
---
Concerning Blizzard, if classic is really successful, then they will obviously think of ways to keep the player base subscribed after phase 6 and even more that, but it's only my opinion, the playerbase in 1-2 years will be ready for some changes
---
You need 35 and 225 fishing for him to offer quest. The drop rate on rare fish isn't bad, it's just getting to them at that level is tough.
---
It's weird. The play-by-play sounds atrocious, but it's been satisfying in a way that nothing else has ever been in  my life.
---
He's reaaaaaaallly cute.
---
*raises hand.*
---
I think the game is trying to tell you two, something.
---
I mean the level for RFK and the level for the warrior quest aren't exactly comparable. I'm in that boat right now.. and killing lv32 elite for corpsemaker vs lv40 elite for whirlwind is night and day
---
Even back in the day SM was a bottleneck, which causes stress. Up to that point everything is fairly easy(except stupid WC)
---
Also auctioneer is not really working in classic right now while auctionator does. They provide the same features.
---
No, it's not. Hey guys, I found the pally who pulled! He's right here!
---
Awesome! Gratz
---
I bless the rains down in Stranglethorn.
---
Hahah watched something on that the other day.
---
No, create a battle.net account and put a subscription on a Warcraft free trial.
---
If you wanna roll tank just go your next points in holy, you can even it out by your early 30s
---
Not really though
---
Thats hilarious tbh
---
Then again I saw a mage near my level that I wanted to fight. I barely lost, I'm pretty sure I would have won if my sprint wasn't on cooldown. I came back to my corpse and he didnt attack me, so every other time I saw him I did the same.
---
Make sure to use auto run during your journey
---
Yeah it would be adding TBC server not new classic content.
---
Yeah if you were comparing to Shroud I would agree. I watch him because I will NEVER be so skillful in FPS games, and I like to watch a "pro".
---
Now Asmongold? He is nobody, in retail mythic raiding scene nor classic raiding. He is just a basement internet troll.
---
Being a Linda is something we should all aspire towards.
---
Why
---
It’s French for lumbermill I think
---
I think they're lackluster raiding DPS, but in PvP they're pretty sick. Can dish out some serious damage while also having heals and decent armor with shield.
---
Only human toon I have ever had was a rogue for the sword skill and detect invis.  Plus for some classes if you are alliance it is human, dwarf or gnome.
---
I just realized I didn't have to put "Alliance side" since I mentioned Goldshire, lol. Oops.
---
Same here! I have the equip command set up in the same macro as my stance cast to make everything super quick and fluid.
---
I send random people siamese cats And practice lock boxes. Flange the Gnome Kromcrush
---
Goblins never should have been neutral in the first place, they were horde.  Just like Horde never should have gotten mages, and alliance never should have gotten warlocks....  and why no ogres for the horde?! Why cows instead of Ogres?!  WC3 ruined everything :(
---
Lol you also hide behind a keyboard you wouldnt be acting like this in public guarantee
---
Son of Arugal would like a word with you
---
Can someone please explain layering to me?
---
It’s just a small tip for the endless hours of free entertainment.
---
You found me!
---
Killing Broken Tooth when a hunter was trying to tame it
---
So how do the streamers sometimes autoloot and sometimes individually click stuff?
---
is it brutal because you don't enjoy playing a warorir?    because i dont discribe things i enjoy as brutal
---
Yeah I mostly meant the comments if this post rather than the post itself, but I wasn’t being smart when I typed out the original comment.
---
Think mage will be my alt (probably would have been anyway) for the ease of farming at 60 after I get my priest sorted out. 
---
Gonna do the same from 50+. 
---
I assume the competition for runecloth will go down eventually, also plan on getting something to 35 asap to spam tailoring and alch CD for the rest of the expac for some passive gold.
---
DKP is trash toxic garbage, you really need to reconsider the whole idea before it kills your guild.
---
I am not joking dude, all it will do is reward the asshole no lifes and kids with ego problems. It will similarly slow your whole guild down as it will invariably leave your more undergeared players in the dust while offering almost 100% of decent gear to your "top 10" as sidegrades.
---
Seriously, don't do it.
---
Q and E
---
I was levelling with a dude I bumped into in Westfall, sharing quests, grinding out goretusk livers, running from Murclocs for hours. I dinged 17 and he said “here. I’ve been saving this as a level 17 congratulation gift” and traded me a blue two handed mace with double the power of the piece of junk I’d been swinging. Now we’re chatting over BN whilst he’s on holiday looking forward to jumping back in together next week.
---
Deep holy for progression, deep disc once you get enough +healing to downrank
---
Good spot to farm is the earth elementals in arathi
---
i mean, i farm leather in durotar while being very over-leveled, but i ask if anyone has quests and have them group up with me, so my farming benefits their questing.
---
As a mage that will soon be 22. When i hit 22, can i bring my friends with me to aoe farm? Is it less efficient? Can i bring people that are 5-10 levels lower than me to help them level? Is it actually faster than questing? What are the advantages/disadvantages.  Any help would be great! Thanks!
---
It kicks in the cop instinct. I ran by a party of 3 yesterday that were the same level as me (so no stigma for them to fight/kill me) and I just started clicking on mobs around the area to pretend like I didn't see them.
---
Ya got skulls all over your armor, man!
---
&gt; Two weeks ago the hype was paupable.
---
**Palpable**. But anyway, the hype is still real. Those of us who were hyping in the weeks before launch are playing the game and living our hype there. The posters here are either memers or those whose enjoyment of WoW comes from bitching on forums and subreddits.
---
Maybe in MC but locks scale quite well so the rationale for bringing 1 shadow priest will get stronger as we progress through the raid tiers. It’s also classic and people have already killed rag  in the first week so min/maxing isn’t really required
---
Those are some big gloves
---
If you *really* want to tank, and be the best at it you can be, I would suggest leaving those points there and putting your next 11 into Holy.
---
It might be a rough mid 20s, but once you're 31 with consecration and imp righteous fury you should be able to tank dungeons to your hearts content.
---
Either this is wrong, or I am doing something wrong. The priest trainer in uc does not have the spell / quest for me
---
I just switched to that after seeing another comment, thanks!
---
While I'm not thrilled with his choice of words, does it really matter? They are just words
---
Genuine mistake, I meant they announced it when kung fu 2 came out lol
---
Lol you must come from private servers. World was and never a thing in Vanilla, it was merely something adopted in the age of pservers and carried over to classic. World is literally nothing but spam LFG cleave groups and trolls. You'll be fine with out it
---
I got level 23 last night in the wetlands and had to call it a night due to work early in the morning. I’m leveling slowly but it sure does feel good!
---
Gonna try that out, cheers
---
Ok cool, so how do you do it?
---
Or just gay burgers.
---
Already got tailoring and I'll definitely be swapping my gathering proff to engi at max level, seems like I'll need to level a mage or hunter alt asap! :)
---
Nope. Actions speak louder than words. I usually say “if I have to heal someone besides the tank we’re going to be taking mana breaks” before I let DPS die. But I’ve also been doing speed focused runs, so that’s actually a threat, lol.
---
As I'm sure you know, there's a general understanding that some specs are more or less usable for group content. Prot pally is one of those.
---
However, with how easy the content has seemed to be so far (and will likely continue to be) and with the vast amount of players that are playing, there seems to be a growing understanding that dungeon and raid groups will be more or less fine when taking content (at least up to AQ40). This means that we can separate class specs into two categories: viable and optimal. All specs are viable, given that the more optimal group is okay with picking up the slack of the less optimal players, and also possibly requiring different strategies to conquer content. 
---
There's just one issue with that: all specs are viable except for prot paladin. Sure, there are a host of players that believe otherwise, but paladin lacks any real taunt and has basically no way to generate instant threat. This makes prot paladin a group-wide effort, and that's just something that is too detrimental to the group to be a logical spec to use. The group has to babysit the paladin and basically generate his threat for him by simply underperforming do that they don't generate more than him.
---
I recommend that you reroll to warrior or druid of you want to tank, or just go to a different spec. Sure, you can level as prot, but it's gonna be slow and very time consuming.
---
A more casual server? Even better!
---
Gonna try this, cheers
---
It's HPM efficiency is really bad so only use Renew for emergencies when the tank is taking heavy damage, or when on the run and someone needs a heal. Otherwise it's not great. Stick with Heal/Greater Heal and as someone else said, heal people in bursts. Get off a couple heals where needed and get back to wanding so you can regen mana. Try not to constantly be healing because you'll go OOM quickly, so let the tank/any dps taking damage get a bit lower before going back to healing so you can spend more time inside the 5sec rule.
---
Ah, the 'play dumb' tactic.
---
Works about 60% of the time, shockingly.
---
PS Fuck you Vintar
---
China's fucked mate
---
*Slides into DMs*
---
VC!
---
Shadow can do it perfectly fine. Not sure about holy/disc
---
I always thank people who help me out.  I think it's generational.  The wave of Gen X / older Millennials who grew up on vanilla/TBC/Wrath still had a strong social component where we treated each other more or less similarly to how we did outside.
---
This younger generation (Zoomers) that grew up with online gaming practically from the cradle is very socially stunted on average and didn't develop interpersonal skills the same way we did. I find they tend to just go on about their business in little islands with very little interaction with each other. I don't think it's a coincidence that the younger crowd doesn't really stay interested in vanilla in general and complains about the lack of QOL requiring them to socialize in order to form groups, raid etc.
---
I play a solo warrior, it's pretty brutal. I still enjoy it.
---
I went to an actual sciery while on holiday this year, it was pretty interesting.
---
Wow turned MMORPGs into MOBAs with leveling, imo. You can see the difference with classic, where actual RPG elements are still present (boats, bullets, and buffs).
---
Let's hope nobody does. I don't think it's possible to cringe hard enough for this shirt.
---
The spec options are 31/20/0 or 21/30/0 for raiding.  Please don’t spec lightwell...
---
as a mage at what level can learn water elemental, or can i even learn water elemental because i cant find it anywhere
---
I am starting the journey with my 8 years old later today. Hope he will enjoy it as well :)

Stop I'm crying

Imagine hating someone's pet.  Couldn't be me.
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve heard. I’m also used to retail where someone can say elemental sucks (I haven’t played since the beginning of this expansion so maybe they’re good now) but you’ll still do most dps if you’re good and have gear, but I’m thinking that classic doesn’t work that way.

In 2005 I thought I'm gonna be the next hawkings foucault mashup. At 32 I've prostituted myself to finance company employing my math skill to do voodoo data magic to make more money for my employer. It pays the bill, my family is cared for. Only thing remains are my books and my games. I will just go out of this world with a buttload of regret and what ifs. It sucks that life is fucking constraining. And fuck my country for investing little in research. Those GDP numbers will go down one day, as competing for cheapest labor is a race to the bottom and a new sucker country will come providing cheaper slave labor. Fucking no jobs in academic research and suckers with PhDs end up in banks and other fat cats finance company. Whenever my manager complements my work I feel like screaming. Do you know how fucking easy my work is? The problems you are struggling with were solved in academia 50 years ago. You are just low IQ loser who think reading Harvard business review makes you smart. The amount of time I heard "you can do that, wow". I was like yeah since 1953. 
---
So tldr gaming rocks, life sucks.
---
I feel your pain man, took multiple days to get those 30 tusks at a 30% drop rate and the ganks ;(.
---
At gunpoint. They are pretty good at it. Tianamen square amirite?
---
There was a queue on Skeram yesterday when I logged in. 1500 yesterday afternoon, when the day before at the same time it was around 3k. it went by a lot quicker (20 minutes) but it was definitely there.
---
Never said you were a psycho, just said that in general people who take pleasure from other people's pain feel the need to bring others to their level, that's all. If that's not you then congrats! You're the exception, and honestly it means you're just a dick.
---
Fuck gamesradar
---
I had a 31 warrior join my SFK group thinking it was RFK. He realized his mistake, but ran us through anyway gaining no XP
---
*laughs in normal server*
---
Are you implying that I am upset/worked up/angry?
---
your probably right, Only they know for sure.
---
Was just pointing out the other possible interpretation of their literal words.
---
Its a good server for the people who just wanna chill/quest/solo/Mine in peace but ya its a ghost town so far. Happy i stayed on Herod, you just have to last longer then the people who will quit after the first month. I would not Xfer and think this is a good warning for people who wanna find quick groups and socialize
---
When I see alliance that are engaged with too many mobs and running I don't gank them. I just root them so they get caught and eaten by tigers.
---
I don't want to spend 30 hours hitting 31-32 just to have my progress grind to a halt to being corpse camped.
---
Wtf are you talking about? You've just basically described how I farmed up my epic mount in vanilla wow by just doing resource farming. I genuinely doubt they're actually layer hopping at all and the nodes are just repopping by the time they start the path over since they're all getting cleared out instead. Hell by farting around trying to "layer hop" they're realistically wasting time they could be farming lmao
---
You can set autolook to a modifier. Like 'right click on mob to loot normally', 'shift-right click on mob to autoloot'
---
They have to accept your duel request for that to work though lol, you can't just walk onto the zep and MC people like on the boat.
---
When you decide to go vegan and 2 weeks later start hallucinating looking at fruit
---
Well all the Priests in that guild are Dwarves so that's not the best argument. I'm a Night Elf myself, though but just sayin'.
---
What is this inventory addon?
---
Yea, I've given away countless enchants, bags and some cloth gear to fellow clothies as I level my skills. It's nice getting that "I love you" after.. lol
---
yes top right hand corner somewhere in interface options I Forget sepcifically where
---
These servers have a huge population so you won't have a hard time finding dungeon groups with the alliance.
---
When the bgs open up you will get instant queues while the horde has to wait
---
Shoot, I'm about to ding 40 and it's still better than anything else I've got. The drop from SM GY is slightly better, bu there's nothing else comparable until level 40+ considering the shadow damage is amped by your talents to get more damage.
---
It it really that bad? =/
---
I agree, but at the same time you should be considerate of your other group members. I was quite frustrated when our Paladin healer grabbed the Herod loot as only Mail user and then needed Whitemane’s Chapeau for healing when I was the only cloth user in the group, as a mage.
---
You should be able to quest all the way to 60 without running out of quests!  Each level bracket has around 3 zones you can bounce around from.  I believe someone mentioned Joana’s guide?  That’s a really good one if you like following a worded guide.. which in the end is the best one.  Another guide you might want to look at is Zygor.  Zygor’s guide is fantastic in a sense where it tells you where to go, and all you have to do is follow the arrow.. sadly it’s the worst guide they have ever made, but still better than if you were to just quest on your own terms.  Just my 2 cents since I don’t want to see you play like Eric Cartman and kill 10,000 boars.
---
I always though this was a bug.  I didnt know you needed a landmark.  Drives me NUTS haha.
---
Yeah! More of this and less of the Kardashians.
---
Head over to the eastern kingdoms and quest in redridge.
---
So I used the addon a bit last night and I just wanted to point out some things I noticed.
---
1. It looks very nice. Really cool to see that drastic of a change literally overnight. Good job!
---
2. I think the tool tip might be a bit much as it's showing some redundant info. Other than the note that's displayed in yellow.
---
I would maybe getting rid of redundant information in the tooltip (maybe note only?) and then anchor the tooltip to the right of the window. I can't photoshop something cause it would take too much time, but I'll throw something together in paint.

Needed bracers for a quest in Badlands. None on the AH. Posted in world chat "LF Blacksmith" and got someone who was already in Badlands. PERFECT! I bought the mats, hearth back to Badlands, only to realize there is no anvil in Badlands. That is when the Smithing Side Quest "Craft These Bracers and Send to Me Whenever You Get to an Anvil...Please I am Trusting You" was accepted. If this was retail I would never had done this. I believe in Classic players.
---
I know, I was fucking with you. The topic has been discussed at length. It's common knowledge.
---
Please god download an alignment addon and move that vanish/whole bar to the left to be centered. My OCD hurts.
---
You wildly misunderstand this.   You only queue for the server if it is full.  What "full" is, is determined *directly* by the number of layers.
---
How are you not understanding this?  Without layers, 3000 people (jsut use that number, it's probably closer to 3500) can log in to a single server.  Then EVERYONE ELSE is in a queue for that server.   With say, two layers allowed per server, suddenly 6000 people login before you hit a queue.    With three layers allowed per server 9000 people can login before you hit a queue.
---
More layers = more people allowed per server = less people sitting in the queue at once.
---
I seriously am mind boggled how this is hard for you to understand.
---
You shouldn’t do it for the appreciation you should do it because it’s a nice thing to do.
---
There used to be a premade we would play against back in the day that would set up shop with their FC defended at the "entrance portal" of WSG and steadily try to MC people out of the BG to thin the herd
---
I mean if someone just died I'm pretty sure a rez and buffs is better than a graveyard run... Did you read the post?
---
It's a parallel instance of the server. You could be standing in the exact same place as someone and not know they were there unless you were moved to their layer (say by inviting them to your group). All mob spawns, NPCs, herbs/ores are independent on each layer which is partially why layering is considered contentious as it seperates servers. The advantage however is that you can host more people on the server and have more people in an area without causing issues.
---
I just ran my lvl 17 nelf hunter from Darkshore to Redridge yesterday.
---
There's tons of quests there.
---
Idk about that man. I did just have to experience a skull rogue coming back to stvietnam just to corpse camp some lowbies like me
---
This just confirms that I’m playing on the wrong server, nobody on thalnos (at least horde so far) are friendly to that extent. Our biggest problem are U.S. American players being racist to the LATAM players. 
---
Crossing my fingers I run into good people!

Tone may be hard to convey over text. I'm not butt hurt, nor do I refuse to invite like you say. I'm simply stating that I miss the ease of not being forced to. I get that you're being defensive because of the amount of recent posts trashing layer, but I'm simply starting a conversation with something I find slightly annoying. 
---
You don't have to agree with me.
---
Half you morons didn’t even read his post.
---
Ele shamans did indeed suck in patch 8.0 but 8.1 and onward they are actually very top tier
---
Man, I just can't do it. You gotta give me at least $10.
---
They (shellfish traps) respawn so fast I don't think it would make much difference other than if you wanted to farm them with less people around doing the same. I went back earlier after posting this and sure enough there's a lot more people doing it now but it didn't matter, still farmed 60 shellfish in around 30 mins or so no problems.
---
Travel to an AH and pay the deposit? ... Nah.. AH is already filled with cloth
---
As a rogue I’m the one getting ganked by everyone. STV is a war zone regardless if you’re just questing.
---
One shaman can provide both.
---
Nope, Silent Bob.
---
Hahahahaha
---
I've noticed definite pushback on wands. I think they are currently bugged because that shouldn't be a thing.
---
Same boat here, just switched to Details after years of Recount. I like Details better after a few days of use. Seems to be similar in terms of features there might be more in Details and the UI is much better imo.
---
I used recount for a few days and had constant issues with it.
---
Details works great, looks nicer, has more functionality and customization.
---
I really don't know why anyone would use recount anymore, tbh. Addon has been "meh" ever since it first came out probably 12 years ago and it's received very little in terms of visual AND functional improvements.
---
Only to ultimately get your ass grilled by sitting on a burning pony.
---
nay
---
I've never done it, but I watch Twitch sometimes. If I ran into a streamer that I really enjoyed watching I would definitely toss them in game currency since I don't spend RL money paying for their sub. Just a token of appreciation for entertainment they provide. I don't watch any WoW Streamers though so, not an issue.
---
Because pallies can really use healing gear. There is barely any healing plate.
---
Just annoyed at the 15 pictures of cats in this subreddit a day it’s dumb
---
Harder to find groups for PvE content/end game guilds, but also shorter PvP BG queues.  You'll get ganked more, but then again whenever you want to find a fight they're easy to find (if you're on a PvP server).  There's good and bad.
---
Best looking class for armor sets.
---
Reputation gain increased.
---
\+5 Sword and Mace skill
---
Do I need to play more?  
---
Why do people play with Night Elf, to begin with, lol? Shittiest racials ever
---
I understand, but I'm still grumpy about rogues, druid, hunter and shaman all wear leather at this point, and warriors will still roll on stamina, str and agility leather gear.
---
As a bear tank, it's just annoying to have so many classes competing for the same armor.
---
And I've mained one since vanilla, what was your point?
---
Because its fun to watch them
---
Because nodes drop blue/purple BoE!
---
When I got him back in the day I camped his ass for days... on classic, I leveled to 23 fast enough that when I ran there he was just up.  Tamed him as a level 16 stood there watching me.  Felt so good that I didn't have to camp him again... because I would have.
---
Prior to the word mage, catch up.
---
Still higher level than me! 19 undead mage here. Pretty happy with keeping my professions up though
---
I think you need to look up the "Placebo Effect" because that sounds like what 99.9% of these people are doing. They're not actually gaining any real benefit from layer hopping but because "some guy" said they are and they're dumb enough to believe them they're just going for confirmation bias that it MUST be working by "some guy" said so where in reality it's likely making 0 difference
---
its a trick called "releasing the w key"
---
I know. I see the difference from my guild to the sub it’s just upsetting cause it really isn’t just a nostalgia trip - Classic is closer to vanilla then we had. People care. People help. People fuck with you. 
---
I’m so happy. It’s just upsetting to see my happiness not translate across the sub. But as you said - a lot of people bitching would always find a reason too.
---
I loved that dude
---
Because it clearly have No connection to ”deadmines”.
---
Sapped a shaman and stole the goldthorn he was trying to pick as he watched helpless.
---
I'm the one who was claimed by the boat in the pic. Was fishing off the dock waiting for the menethil harbour boat when suddenly it took me away.
---
That’s cause y’all sleeping on 1k Needles, Arathi, and Desolace. Was 29 by the time I finished up all my Ashenvale/Stonetalon lines, banged out 1k needles and then jumped between desolace and arathi clearing quests that were going green first.
---
Within the 30-40 range you also have Dustwallow which nobody ever remembers, but is actually an amazing place to make gold for your mount due to mobs everywhere dropping high value vendor loot and low competition for said mobs. I ran into maybe 4 alliance the entire 2 levels I was there and we just /waved and kept doing our thing.
---
The only way you could have done it better is letting some mob kill them for extra repair costs.
---
60/40 means there's 50% more Horde than Alliance. It's definitely noticeable and that's the point when you start feeling you're always outnumbered.
---
Guess Dorian wanted to play Classic too.
---
It has it's ups and downs.
---
Open world pvp can be rough, but you'll likely be able to queue for battlegrounds in seconds while horde players have to wait.  
---
As long as it's a populated server you'll still see plenty of people.  At 6000 active alliance players, that's still a ton of active players. Though it matters more what the peak time concurrent average is than how many individual players are on the server.
---
I doubt it, I dont think it was available in vanilla so they probably won't add it.
---
Skin/mining nodes don’t drop blue/purple BoEs.
---
yeah he's an awesome dude. i was pvp-ing with him in hillsbrad earlier
---
I'd ask the person who rolled need to equip it immediately. It won't stop someone from being a douche and refusing so they can sell it, but then at least I'll know to blacklist that person and warn my guild about them. Being a dick just because other people might be dicks isn't the answer. 
---
And it is about trust. Unless Resolve is starting each dungeon by telling his group that he needs on all epics he will probably screw someone over by doing this. I hit greed almost instantly on any item I know I can't use, trusting that everyone in the party will act the same way.
---
I was told no by some random dude on the internet who heard it from another random dude who heard from a friend who once knew a guy that worked at Blizzard 6 years ago.
---
It's really taken off after Ready Player One. I do hope that VR brings in a new era in MMORPG gaming, but I fear that the formula has been quantified too well at this point for any major studio to release a \*good\* MMORPG. Which is a shame. Hosting and uptime are cheaper than ever, but unfortunately good engineers are more expensive than ever.
---
You guys crack me up.  I'm not berating anyone.
---
Are the guys from Full Circle members of  a guild from a certain private realm, also previously called Full Circle? Some of them previously played on a realm called cwow and we were together in the top Alliance raiding guild called Symbiosis. Ah, good times early to mid 2010.
---
LOL my guilds foundation is 20+ people I know irl we gamed with together at an internet cafe... My guild and friends literally love me more because of this... I'm the GM of one of the largest guild on Kromcrush, but go have fun with your "friends" while i literally have a guild of 100+ people giving me leather (290 LW btw) and already have 5 bis 19 twink blues...
---
If you were in my guild this toxic behavior would immediately get kicked, so have fun pugging MC in a year while we have Naxx on farm lololol get rekt kid :)
---
I'm playing a warrior and I slam my fist on the wall every time a party member pulls and bloodrage is on cooldown.
---
Yeah don't see the issue either. I can't stand YouTubers like him so I just don't watch him.
---
Hit 40 and about to respec to shadow. Should I pick more reach or put the points in Blackout? Is improved wands still i
---
The pats that run around EVEN SPRINT UNDERWATER. I got ganked by a pat that sprinted through the water in the pools outside WC while I was fishing :(
---
Been watching some skarm tank videos. I guess paladins are kinda shit because of mana.
---
Can't prove you're not Hitler. Must be Hitler! Haha wtf is this shit. Generally I don't enjoy trolling but if you've riled this guy this much I can see why youre enjoying it.
---
..gems?
---
RIP OP.
---
The Alliance counterpart to RFC is actually stocks and not DM. The closest thing to DM is probably WC honestly.
---
Lol, as a fellow alliance I salute you!
---
thanks for the info! i knew there was definately something wrong/incomplete with the data
---
Same reason some people like Batman.
---
He's a mortal man standing among the gods.
---
What’s wow classic rule number 3?
---
TotalRolePlay3 it's an add-on.
---
Just gotta get her farming for your mount . Immagen a world where your child is says "please let me farm EPL grays for you so you can get your eppic mount" 
---
I'll never forget it when WOTLK came out my little bro probably 13 at the time asked if he could play for a bit after I went to bed . Showed him what I was doing and what quest to do . Woke up at 7 am for school and he was still next to me and just looks at me sleepy and says " I dinged 2 time " one of the proudest moments as a brother yet.
---
!remindme 22h
---
I think the biggest problem early on is that you really want natural weapons because it's the biggest no gear upgrade you can get but it puts you 10 point behind in getting to deep feral which is amazing. Of course if you're tanking Furor is huge QoL so you can pre-hot for threat and just go right in. And again natural weapons is amazing for threat too.
---
STEALTH PERFECTED
---
Defense is as much of a toothless stat as too much hit in dungeons. I see people running around with 13% hit as fury all the time in dungeons when they need *five* to hit all special abilities. 
---
Wasting great stats on defense and hit puts apart the good players and the ones blindly following spreadsheets thinking raid boss attribute allotment has any meaning in dungeons.
---
You can just see the Orc knowing he is totally fucked by the 46 Priest at his level.  He's just accepting his fate.
---
Surprised both not only were able to board the boat but survive that long without Alliance just destroying them.
---
Nice! 2 gold pieces for a staff!
---
Warlocks dont have a threatdump. We will literarily stand in place doing nothing.
---
On my orig character, a NE, I had friends run me to IF. I didn't have that luxury this time so at lvl 20 I made my way there, but decided I wanted to do all the early quests anyway, even thoguh they're gray and don't give anything useful. I've been using this time to give lowbies in the area things I've picked up that I would normally vendor, or food I've made to up my cooking. I even handed out some scrolls of prot/stam yesterday.
---
I really enjoyed doing that, and it's making my leveling take forever lol.
---
I think you’re the one that got whooshed. ☺️
---
So you can’t fish them up? Or you can?
---
Actually terrifying
---
2-2-2 is the best thing that has ever happened to Overwatch.
---
Idk, I'm having fun with it.
---
Why turn to external resource is there’s a resource right there? Had he asked and no one answered, sure google it then. It’s like holding a calculator but googling what 17x24 is
---
You AH the items didn’t you
---
It's common for people to be called by their last name. Virtually everyone calls him by his last name. 'VanCleef drops it.' The V and C are capitalized in the last name, making the acronym VC legitimate in terms of abbreviation mannerisms. Part of the renown for dungeons are the gear that can be gained from them - VanCleef being at the end of the dungeon *and* having highly sought after drops, it's not surprising that people would use VC. I personally go by DM and go by context - which area I am in or the level of the person looking for a group. I think it's possible to have your cake and eat too, with either abbreviation... but some people just like to be strict and particular about their communication and standards. I say roll with it and you can always ask for clarification as necessary.
---
Ooh, very cool. I’ll definitely watch this when I get some downtime today. Thanks for the link.
---
Ret Paladin is child's play
---
&gt; It won't stop someone from being a douche and refusing so they can sell it, but then at least I'll know to blacklist that person 
---
Yea they don't really give a fuck and blacklisting somebody doesn't stop you from getting screwed over, it just prevents you from getting screwed over *again*. 
---
&gt; Being a dick just because other people might be dicks isn't the answer.
---
That's your opinion and if you wish to play the game in that manner go right ahead. You think this guy just randomly got that way? People lie all the fucking time and most of the people with this mentality are that way because they have been fucked over in the past and they just aren't going to let that happen again. 
---
If you like getting fucked in the ass over some weird principals you have in a video game then by all means just greed and move on, but don't come at me with your principals and try to say I need to change to suit you. 
---
If I don't know you, I don't trust you with equipping BoEs worth hundreds of gold.
---
At this point you've strayed so far from your original comment I don't even know why I'm talking to you. Your reply to the original comment made no sense. The guy was being the opposite of untrustworthy, he was stating his intentions right up front. It also has nothing to do with ego. Everything else you are going on about here has nothing to do with either of those things.
---
So once the BGs are out, it’s possible to level and get decent gear through pvp?  I’m also new.  Thanks
---
Ooh, that's good. I'm going to start doing this now!
---
Will of the Forsaken says hi
---
Not really a helpful response, but I find doing dungeons until 50%, then leveling solo keeps me more motivated post-30 to keep going instead of mindlessly grinding alone.
---
&gt; suddenly one bank alt has 500 of every rare mat and spikes the market up so high
---
... I'm pretty sure dumping 500 arcane crystals on the AH would *crash* the price, not the other way around.
---
No free trials. You could just pay the $15 and cancel it. Try for a month and if you aren't into it, your only out the $15, so no big deal.
---
Guilty.
---
Looks like it continues. Was there a part 2 for sale? This cliffhanger is killing me!
---
Nonsense. Pet crit rate is static and if they attack more often they have a better chance to get into frenzy and stat in frenzy.
---
This is wrong though. There is a lot of variation for most specs in BFA.
---
Honestly, I keep telling myself not to touch the garbage. I think there's some stubborn part of me that thinks I can chip away at cults of personality
---
approximately 4 and a half tubes
---
This happened to me last night. Peacefully quested next to 4+ Alliance for a bit, then a random warrior charges at me. Of course his Ally brethren helped him kill me once the fight started. I proceeded to kill him relentlessly for the next hour, camping his body. Felt good.
---
pff, I got *global first* mob kill of classic on Bloodsail.  second cast crit and killed the boar
---
bam, done
---
I'm curious as well, unfortunately I don't have an answer! Great question
---
rogues can use  blind on a target that has blessing of protection in classic. dwarves can stone form out of blind.
---
I've seen this quote on a Reddit thread previously, but I can't recall where
---
I think what it comes down to, is that without all the extra systems to make this game accessible, you have to treat everyone else as a person, rather than just another player. 
---
There's like an extra skill in your character sheet that's hidden, titled 'Personal Relationships'. 
---
Without it, you'll find groups harder to get later in the game because you'll be playing with the same people.
---
I was really happy when folks were casting on me as I ran past them. This is nice!
---
Yeah I 100% agree with yall, I’ve never been to Duskwood immediately after Elwynn. No idea why Wowhead says as low as 10. Maybe there are some mobs there you can grind?
---
I can honestly say fear is not a factor in me not telling a 10 year old my name. It will literally get you no where fast.
---
I'll say what I say every time people bring this up:
---
DM = Deadmines
---
DM:N/E/W = Dire Maul.
---
OR failing that as someone else pointed out on another post....
---
We should all be calling it "Cookies boat party"
---
Was this on a RP/RP-PVP server?
---
Dude just get two TVs, idk why you're being so difficult
---
Why do people keep saying priests are great leveling? Does it get better above level 20?  My warlock just pewpew'd all through to level 18 in half the time of my priest.  I didn't need to heal up before pulls and could solo larger packs.
---
I'm just NOW not having to drink all the time... so maybe now it picks up?
---
What is this from? Are there classic wow servers up? Been out of the game for awhile
---
I am forcing myself to get my warlock to level 40 before I even touch any alts. Getting a character with a mount makes it much easier to do things and farm for gold/materials.
---
I've tried so hard to get elvui to work. Everything is perfect except I can't see the God damn timers on my dots/hots
---
Half the time now I get a buff and don’t know where it came from. I say “ty” but who knows if it’s heard.
---
R.I.P. Ripjaw
---
Mankirk's wife cheated on him with an elf.
---
Nixxiom, last night.
---
You're right. It's so easy, he's so triggered
---
Damn this is fucking amazing, thanks a lot! I’ll finally be able to get on then
---
I did this for an hour yesterday with my rogue friend
---
Devouring plague and will of the forsaken are very strong PvP skills which are exclusive to undead. Combining them with specing PvP shadow makes them very formidable in PvP
---
True, but even he shouldn't really know - he's a Wandering Isle Pandaren, not from Pandaria himself. At best he knows the general area.
---
Only mouthbreathers call it VC.
---
Level? Not so much
---
But gearing at max level yeah.
---
You won’t regret it m8!
---
Careful, THAT briarthorn picks you.
---
I'm using **miks floating combat text.** 
---
I have the Default interface and Combat text for Damage and healing on myself and everything which goes out via **miks floating combat text**  works fine for me. You see your heals on other Players and other stuff if you want to.
---
Going with the socially stunted option then.   Good luck with that
---
It's ok everyone. He's just pretending to be a chicken shit
---
This is the type of community feel I loved when playing back in the day. I would do similar stuff and keep a log of what I needed to craft for other guild members, etc. 
---
What a time to be playing... and now I have 3 children a wife and a cat and can not find time to save my life. 
---
Classic and even burning crusade was in my opinion the best time to play wow. (I played a affliction and demonology warlock almost exclusively in both, man I miss Jhuuthun… )
---
Your need more muscle on them bones!
---
Yes, let me spend 30 minutes to an hour just for you, special little snowflake.
---
Best grinding spot are the elementals in Arathi Highlands btw.  They have a 50% chance to drop an elemental charm, Warriors need 24 of these charms (8 of 3 different elemental types) for their Whirlwind Axe and they're BoE.  On my server they go anywhere from 50s to 1g.  That means every two kills you're making a minimum of 50s.  These mobs are level 39ish, since Warriors get the quest at level 30 you can easily sell these charms to impatient Warriors.
---
Dire Maul doesn't exist yet i don't think
---
&gt; That's why we're seeing a lot more casual-friendly and even mobile games instead of another MMO.
---
Or maybe because they already run hands down the most popular MMO around today and don't want to cannibalize their own market.
---
And here I was thinking BFA professions were near useless, professions are literally useless here if quests and dungeons exist!
---
The minority faction is always the better faction if pvp is your favorite thing.
---
Or maybe, just maybe, they don't really care about getting their name in the credits, but they appreciate the streamer's content and think he or she deserves to get paid for doing their job.
---
Lol seeing this in " letter form " makes it 10 times more hilArious
---
So? I am guy I still find it beyond creppy and odd as fuck you felt the need to search there Facebook this many years later. You need to get laid man.
---
It's simple: while leveling your spec is nonsense anyway. There's virtually no need to spec for any specific role before maybe endgame gearing dungeons.
---
It's nice to give your group a heads up about what you intend to roll on. "I'm going to roll on leather caster and agi gear." Let them speak now or forever shut their fucks up.
---
Loot drama before max level is going to happen, have a thick skin and grind past the haters.
---
I had a mage ask for a tip for water once. I said sure no problem. Just as soon as I get tipped for HS and SS. We should probably tip the healer and tank too for being kind enough to use their abilities
---
Mankrik *is* the wife, in disguise. She was cheating on Mankrik with Charlga Razorflank and he found out. Charlga panicked and killed Mankrik and mortally wounded Olgra by accident. Charlga asked a favor of Amennar the Coldbringer, who reanimated Mankrik's body and transferred Olgra's spirit into it.
---
15$ for a month, even for trying the game is cheap as can be with how much content is provided for a month. You could play 4 to 8 hours a day and still be provided with something to do or explore and still not cover more than 50% of what the game has to offer.
---
Just shell it out and give it a whirl, you wont be dissapointed.
---
Is there a way, a addorn or something, to show low lvl quests? I don't care if it is on the map or over the npc.
---
Yes but botters avoid people like the plague. I would program a delay if I got a rez because I knew people were there or at a minimum I would rez and wave then logout. The fact they were running from getting ganked means it was not a bot.
---
I’ve done: Waited in stealth for others to pull the agro for a quest item. 
---
They’ve done: Ran up while I was fighting 3 mobs and taking the herb I was clearing!
---
Also them: I was about to solo a rarespawn. Low level noob comes up and asks for invite. I go sure. I kill the rare. Roll greed on the item. He rolls need leaves group and runs off. (I will not forget you, Perturb!!...)
---
A warrior who was a bit low level for ashenvale, got lost quite close to a horde quest spot, and i figured i'd let him be and then he fucking charged me... So obviously i hunted him for 45 minutes.
---
I got my whirlwind axe at lvl 30, however I been dual wielding since lvl 20. Not sure what it is, but I am killing faster and easier with DW. Currently my whirlwind axe is sitting in my bags until I respect and get mortal strike or bloodthirst when I hit 39 to see if there’s a differences.
---
"Inventory is full"
---
Afaik, It's compensated by the fact that horde has very limited entry to Kalimdor, all 3 ways end in Durotar/Ratchet, Alliance has the both Ratchet/Dustwallow AND Auberdine, while Lordaeron is balanced with two different entry points for both factions.
---
Yea you can still do transmutes for guildies/friends
---
i used to do this in one of the PVP zones and drop em off cliffs.
---
&gt; one shaman cannot provide both.
---
Windfury totem puts an 8 second buff on the weapon, which persists even if the totem is removed. The buff is only removed when it times out.
---
Grace of Air totem applies immediately, but stops applying the second the totem is replaced.
---
You can get both effects by placing Windfury totem, waiting for it to apply to the weapons, then placing Grace of Air for a few seconds, then place Windfury again to refresh the buff after 8 seconds, GoA when the buff applies, repeat.
---
Warrior fights 1 mob, has to eat an entire meal after
---
Warrior fights 2 mobs, dead
---
What a bargain. That letter is worth an easy 5s
---
30% drop rate??! Mine felt like 20% max
---
I will when I'm high enough to run it haha
---
&gt; This is a custom map you can use as your home on Steams VRhome application for the Vive and Index. You can even place all your props and trophies from game achievements in the world, one of which being a panel that projects your desktop. I've got my home and props set up at the Goldshire Inn, but I figured showing the walk in to Stormwind would be neat. As well, there are a few Wow custom intractables the map maker created. I'm assuming the map was ripped from the game files, but I don't know for sure.
---
Pissing off their PC market isn't a big deal, though. Also, even the maddest people tend to scapegoat Activision, showing how desperate those people truly are to remain Blizzard fanboys. 
---
Most importantly, pissed off gamers still often buy the thing they are pissed about, or otherwise continue to support that company even while they rant about it.
---
Tyvm
---
You can't twist in classic for longer than a minute.
---
Here's the Punisher explaining to some cops why they shouldn't idolize him. The fact that he's murdering bad people doesn't change the fact that he is a mass murdering terrorist. At best, I'd call him an anti-villian.

lol you have not idea what you are talking about, I'm level 26 warrior with 100g+ in my bags only by selling what I craft( I didn't farm a single ore/herb/leather) I buy raw matterials from AH and sell crafted stuff back in AH , my professions are maxed at 225 because level requirement. and by the way my /played time is only 1d 20hr, to me grinding for greys is too much time consuming and boring.
---
But OP didn’t use optimal methods therefore we must mock and ridicule. As is tradition.
---
I literally don’t remember ANYONE calling it DM back in the day so it’s VC
---
Go down the shadow tree.   Get the +spirit after every kill.   It seriously adds so much.   You can go down shadow tree and be completely fine healing dungeons.   When they are not around you should use mind flay and shadow word pain on an enemy, shield yourself, then wand them til Mindflay is off CD.  You will be surprised by how much Mana you will regain.    Also remember that wand damage is a lot of your dps, don't forget to keep it up to date as you level.   I just switched from holy to shadow and the difference is night and day
---
It's literally easy as fk to layer hop lol. Try it for yourself. Worst case scenario you layer hop again if it fails the first time.
---
Id argue that fresh blood that grew up playing Vanilla are now in the dev ranks that matter in Blizzard. Obviously the fact that classic exists shows some competency over there.
---
I have to be optimistic. Theres a good chance they get it right this time around. My only worry is marketing dept. interference which notoriously kills creative ideas.
---
I played vanilla mostly as a feral druid, and I PvPed up to Lieutenant Commander.
---
I had a ton of fun, but I had to work twice as hard and gear myself hardcore to match up to warriors and rogues. I mostly was flag carrying in WSG, ninja capping and harassing in AB, and off-healing and backdoor capping in AV.
---
Fairly sure enhancement shamans were weak in BGs too.
---
This is especially important for priests running deadlines. As you can get the Staff, Ring, and Cookies Wand in the same run 
---
Happened to me and my group let me take the wand and ring, because they were all warriors and rogues!
---
How dumb are you? lol you should never have to click an .exe to add an addon. You are lucky this person didn't have any exploitative virus' in that .exe. Never run .exe's from strangers. I thought everyone on the internet knew this.

You deserve your timeout

Ugh lvl 45 and I’m still plugging away at stv and dustwallow. Should make tamarins a breeze at 46+. Then ungoro.

Are you actually retarded. Both are contested
---
Yup.  This is something I struggle with daily.  When I sit down and count my blessings I usually end up getting emotional at all the good in my life.  Yet the day to day I constantly compare myself to other people.  It's funny because the comparisons are *never* about the person, but rather a specific trait.  For instance, I sold my car because I moved to the city, but now I'm back and looking at used.  Fuck they're expensive.  So now if I see someone whose entire live is a mess *but* they have a nice car - I get jealous.  It's super toxic and I'm really trying not to do it anymore but I feel it's just human nature.

I'm a 33 mage too. Here's what you do. get together 3 mages. a tank, and a good healer. Do Scarlet Monastary Library wing. let the tank pull together a large group, 3 of you arcane explosion spam till dead. repeat.
---
In all honesty, I'm probably thinking too much into this.
---
just make S forward, A D strafe get rid of back peddle?
---
Ok, we understand that is how the trick works. The question that was asked was how do they keep the animation going. They don't keep it going. Yours was not an answer to that question.
---
Talking about this sub, which is why I said wow classic edition. Genius. The post is old and you felt the need to comment on it, because you cant let things be. Because, through your post history, you're an old guy who lives alone, thus lonely and bitter. Goodluck sorting that out lol
---
Either or at this point. We don't know what is optimal but both are definitely great.
---
Do you not tank? I made sure to have a ranged weapon I could use before I ever stepped foot into deadmines because body-pulling in instances usually means adds.
---
Its just a very famous 4chan copypasta
---
It was. I was also constantly broke from respeccing between enhance for fun and resto for raiding. 
---
I didn’t get an epic mount until shortly before TBC.
---
We must protect savant from the internet.
---
There will be pvp gear. Only ....next phase when they release the pvp ranking system. It will be glorious. No need to raid at all. But you have to put effort into pvp to get the gear ofc.
---
You'll learn it all before too long and the world will feel more alive and real for the knowledge. Don't let retail corrupt your experience.
---
That is a source.  And you can Google it.
---
Layers add to concurrency limits.
---
Pop caps and concurrency caps are not the same things, either.
---
Concurrency directly relates to queue times.
---
They sure did, although was mostly server dependent.

Why do i see players with a green name that says pvp next to it when im playing on a pve server?
---
I'm lvl 39 and I'm still using the blue chest from deadmines quests. Some items last a really long time. Casters will be using the illusionary rod from library for like 15 levels.
---
Loads of time mate just start smashing it

Then explain it to me then lol
---
"only level 39"

that's like 72 hours of play time lol.

I’ve been saved by a few people and I always /ty /hug! I’m very grateful cause the corpse run is not fun. Thank you!
---
Probably be easier to make a bounty board. Players can place what they want on the board and place the deposit as the reward. Exp can be small so people dont abuse. itd be more for wealth or getting weird tasks out of the way.
---
Or you could look at it that you have a partner and a child - infinitely better than WoW in the long run ;)
---
Questie
---
Yeah everything is completely legible yet people get so butt hurt over this.
---
.... A stranger on the internet sent you an .exe file and you opened it?
---
Have you tried reducing font size on it to save space?  You also might think about redesigning your display to work with it.
---
I have all my bags and my minimap at the bottom of the screen so the entire right side can be taken up by MonkeyQuest.  Also I always collapse the areas on MQ that I am not currently in to save space.
---
If there was one thing I’ve learned from the Limewire days of the internet, it was to not open unknown .exe files. 
---
Consider this a lesson learned.
---
How big it is depends on the class because some classes are just more gear dependant but in general you'll be at a pretty big disadvantage if you can't get any raid gear.
---
There will be 1 day pugs of easier dungeons eventually you don't have to not raid it'll just be less consistent.
---
But the servers don't have that capacity.  The servers without layering have a capacity between 3000-4000.
---
If they turned off layering RIGHT NOW. Every server would have a 10k+ queue, most in the 15-20k range.  Then if they turned it back on, all those people would get to log in.
---
12 years ago I was annoyed that &lt;Nagas in Slave Pens&gt; was banned since it was Blizzard who decided to do that... &lt;Defias in Deadmines&gt; was allowed... but now I can see where the first one could be offensive.
---
Yeah, and my point is the ‘lot of you’ it will lose aren’t even a blip on the radar. You over estimate your important.
---
stuff.  Guild alliances, secret erp rooms, etc.
---
Best thing is though. You don’t have to hurry up and level them before the next xpac.

No. I don't live in a country where people think if they hit you with a car that smartest thing to do is get out and make sure you are dead. I don't live in a country where if you aren't Chinese the government will overturn contracts in court without notifying you and then make you unable to leave the country because you have to pay debts that aren't yours.

Me: "Nope"

You can opt into pvp with /PvP when playing on a PvE server.

its kinda sad you have to cheat on your favorite pet with other pets to upgrade your favorite pets abilities.

I sent a DM to my DM asking if he wanted to do DM or DM, but he said his chars were too high for DM and too low for DM. IDM though, I'll ask someone else.
---
jesus , why do I skill alchemy, these shoulds look strong af
---
The saving up and all that hardwork for the gold really helps to make the satisfaction even more amazing, that's the beauty of classic
---
I have the exact opposite memory. I didn’t even realise there was a small contingent of players who did call it VC until a few months ago, because it’s clearly called DM.

I’ve made some people some stuff just because I’m skilling my leatherworkinf...gonna make it anyway. then I just open trade with other rogues and they are super suspicious. It’s actually pretty funny to see how people react. Like it’s a prelude to some other proposition.

Seeing as you’re trying to tell me the gaming industry fluctuates when my point was it’s becoming more popular, just not in the mmo sphere I’m gonna say you didn’t understand, final answer.

---
Ohh that makes sense i was unaware that you could do that
---
I guess I could see it being described the way that you do,  except that your's is all hopeful that they would increase server capacity to match total layers capacity, to prevent queues.
---
Mine is more inline with their stated intentions, that each server ends up with 1 layers worth of Active players. which means the rest get queued.
---
Why? You rolled a pvp server. This is what happens, and there was no secret about it. The vast majority of players on PvP servers _dont_ want even fights. They want to gank with numbers, they want to camp lowbies, they want to be on the faction thats dominant. Very few people want that constant struggle from even fights.
---
Ah yes sounds like China alright
---
all the private server kids called it VC, as long as I can remember deadmines was called DM in vanilla.

I'm happily walk those 1k yard when i died... don't even mad. Man this is Classic.
---
There’s also the fact that if they had talent trees in retail, they would be INCREDIBLY long. I mean, you’d have over 100 talent points after it was all said and done..
---
I would say give it a shot. Try to find a guild with people around your level that you can group with become friends with. If it's not fun, don't feel like you can't start over somewhere else. You'll definitely get ganked. Everybody does.
---
Everyone in Azeroth knows about Northrend, since its where the lich kings army comes from and WoW takes place shortly after the events of the frozen throne. As for Pandaria the lore states that before the War of the Ancients Pandaria was visible to the world and Pandaren traveled all throughout Azeroth trading goods and knowledge, then the legion came and they shrouded their continent in mist to protect themselves as it was too late to do so for the rest of the world.
---
There is specific pvp gear, in fact there is a full pvp series plus weapons. 
---
However, to get the full epic pvp set plus weapons you need to get rank 14... which will require that you play around 12 hours a day... 7 days a week for 3 months straight with no breaks at all (if you take e.g. 1 day off you need to make up those 12 lost hours before the end of the week).
---
The reality is that without pveing, and without the time to pvp like that you'll be at a disadvantage.
---
Certain classes like rogues can genuinely kill enemy players 1 v 1 even with truly awful gear if you have the right professions, consumable and skill level.
---
However, in a normal group situation if you're in levelling greens and your enemy is in full T2 you'll be facing an uphill battle.
---
yes you can but you have to fish in schools, or floating wreckage.
---
Jesus that was dumb, really fn dumb homie.
---
meh, Haters gonna hate it's not really my issue.
---
Though there was that one dude who said I need a tl:dr and I like that kind of criticism because I can do something with it
---
Everquest disagrees with its 25 expansions and counting lol
---
I played vanilla and playing classic and seeing people go “ITS VC U FACKIN NUB!!!” Is the first time I’ve ever seen deadmines abbreviated as vc. Deadmines came before dire maul so it’s called DM and dire maul is DM followed by the wing such as dm east or dm west or even DM:E or DM:W. I got so sick of leveling in westfall because I had to see constant screeching by a few people who would repeatedly argue with people about how it’s vc and how it’s always been vc. No moron you’re just trying to be a contrarian and are a butthole.
---
&gt; Playing classic just feels...simpler. 
---
It feels that way because it is technically harder.  
---
There is less hand holding, it is less linear, you are incentived to cooperate. There is less QoL.  The game is about exploring the world itself, that is the narrative. 
---
Its not a loot pinata skinner box.  You aren't just play the Titanforge slot machine. Gear is meaningful and recognizable. We aren't slaves to our iLvL and [raider.io](https://raider.io) metrics.
---
I kill every rogue I see on sight, sorry. People typically don’t roll rogues on pvp servers to be the nice guy so I take my shot while I can
---
Kings all the time.  Sanctuary if they pull aggro more than once.
---
I’m not complaining either, I love the world pvp and don’t mind dying.
---
what's 2-2-2? forcing only 2 of each type?
---
Yep. If they wanted true classic should have only had the AH in IF and Org, and cross-faction ones.
---
Darkshire for me, especially in the rain at night.
---
Because people are better at this shit than they were in 2005?
---
Yeah.  Times change.  You can't *just go back*.
---
Just get spy and kos them. That's what I do for everyone that ganks me. Doesn't matter if it's a fair fight or not, it just tags the people actually interested in pvping and who might be fun to fight against. But mainly, VENGEAAANCE !
---
But then a hunter can tame you :(
---
As a priest, I'm having a great time buffing absolutely everyone I see.  I've even managed to kill myself once as I stopped fighting a mob to buff a random guy running by and went oom in the mob fight.  I really love ninja healing and buffing up players who are about to die.  Most people say thanks and that's great.  I always rez random bodies I come across.  One guy was very excited about it.  It's the little things that take almost nothing from you that make other happy.

You installed a random .exe directly from a random person in the world. Oh my God format your drive now and reinstall your operating system. Jesus...
---
Yeah.. Had magefist gloves drop on day 3, which was a major upgrade for three people in the group, including me. Saw the guy who won the need roll spam in trade about it later. Maybe not as bad as an epic, but still a dick move. I wanted those gloves as an upgrade, not to try and sell for a few gold.
---
I always have auto-loot turned on in retail, but I found that I actually like not auto-looting in Classic. In early levels when your bags are small, I was running back to vendor things far too often. Yes, it helped get some early cash, but it wasn't all that fun.
---
Since switching to manual loot (and using the option to open the loot window at your mouse cursor), I've enjoyed inventory management a whole lot more, and I haven't found much of a drop in cash-making (if you pick up only the relatively valuable things to sell).
---
Or maybe they just enjoy ganking/world PvP.
---
Fuck me this just sounds like projection.
---
Every Ferengi on Star Trek was played by a Jew btw.
---
You shouldn’t be drinking at all if you use spirit tap correctly. Warlocks are one of the best leveling classes out there so I doubt priest is better but they are definitely better than many other classes. Get a greater magic wand and then get cookies wand from Deadmines and then get the one from BFD quest. I kill mobs my level or below and I can pretty much chain them back to back and never need to drink.
---
True, but they meander slowly so tree ninja sons is the scary part. The pack moves so fast it's already on you when you look away for a second.
---
I used to play alliance and I though for the longest time horde were just huge fucking assholes but everyone is so nice and cool
---
I love sharing gear. It just gets expensive to make. I usually offer it for free to those in beed but i also take the tips they offer. Just last night I was helping a 25 hunter in a thousand needles and he was having a tough time. So after we finished the quest I used the last of my materials and money to craft him some nice level 25 leather gloves with +24 reinforcement and some hillsman shoulders. I offered it for free but took the tip he offered. 
---
I try to craft for everybody who helps me free of charge.
---
This is so pure.
---
Wow so woke
---
 In soviet Ironforge, you heal priest!

Ya so you did something really stupid and are lucky there isn’t some ransom ware holding your whole computer hostage. If you really want to play again make a new account and buy another subscription because there is no way for you to prove to blizzard that you weren’t intending to bot fishing.
---
Exactly. I know it’s not feasible for a ret to tank higher end dungeons. But it was fun ripping through it. Also had a really awesome healer which helped
---
You're correct. Luckyboy has no reading comprehension.
---
Pallies tank dungeons fine, waiting on their mana is the only real downside and even that isn’t always an issue if you’re dps is mostly casters that are using their mana to aoe and also need to drink every pull.
---
yeah it's great xp per hour, but ultra aids and not at all fun in my opinion. That's why I said renew was my most used, because we're just always moving and it heals up any incidental damage dps took and such.  I'm really hoping the aoe everything down meta doesn't work for strat/scholo etc but I'm sure it'll work fine and continue to ruin dungeons for me. :(
---
Both are in use tbh
---
How is that any different from just making an expansion? You're talking about changing how the game works in PvE and adding more content. Sounds like an expansion to me.
---
That's not even the best part. The best part is you get to run with him again some day and go on an adventure together.
---
The fuck planet do you live on? I've gone from 105 to 211 lock picking from picking junkboxes off humanoid mobs. I've gotten about 5 points from opening other players lockboxes and 10 from footlockers.

Guys I appreciate you sharing your opinions on this, but with all due respect I don't want this post to turn into an argument about which loot system is best. Our guild is running DKP and I'm interested in getting our kinks worked out.
---
Same thing happened to me, I grouped with a paladin to do some quests and they noticed my warrior had some subpar gear. They took me back to town and crafted several items and gave them to me for no cost, to which I think I found some copper bars and sharpening stones that I gave them as thanks. The playerbase so far has been amazing.
---
This is what I did on my Tauren Warrior 15 years ago! The gold was pretty good, but what really helped was all the Mithril I was able to mine. Sold like 5 stacks for 6-7g each at the time, which put me well ahead of the gold required for my mount.
---
Don’t forget BRM
---
Better tell your friend to prepare his butthole.

I’d buy gold. I have a corporate gig, make good money, and have limited play time.

Not going to because I’m going to run strat live 4 times a night after work to reserve orbs and do DM E, but I don’t blame people who do.  Must suck to have a cousin as judgemental as you

I remember rogues being extremely powerful in vanilla. Some groups brought up to 12 rogues to MC. Isn't high dps without needing dots actually a huge bonus in vanilla due to the debuff limit?
---
Oh I am years ahead of that.  Just like I've lived a life of being good IRL but it still doesn't change my bad experiences I encounter.  It's a shame, but it is what it is.
---
Does the buff stick after mc releases? I have never even considered..
---
I've ran across a lot of allies who were 5 level or more lower than me that I left alone. There was also a rouge and druid who went invis after seeing me, but I could see them while invis and waved at them.
---
I've also seen a lot of allies 5+ level over mine that left me alone. Except for hunters, hunters always attack me. So I kill hunters regardless.
---
Win-win!
---
OwO
---
What's that addon that tells you how many hands the item is in the icon?
---
Succubus is also better dps than imp if you can manage the run for the quest :). 
---
But it seems like a level issue, and especially when your lower you are going to want to wand instead of Shadow bolt for better Mana conservation and because of the high resist chance on the mobs.
---
Yup, you bastards. Why do I feel bad when fishing and not getting any xp?
---
...and this is why if I take a boat I hide my ass waaaaay down in the bottom of the ship so I can hopefully not be MC'd off.
---
Funny because I played Vanilla and BC and quit until the end of Legion. Never once saw it called VC in game, just saw memes on the internet over the years of mouth-breathing clickers who call it VC
---
How do you have the bagspace??
---
Gold is fleeting but a tank buddy you can make run with you through all your dungeons is priceless.
---
So you might get three nodes when you should get one by joining two different groups if you organize it correctly.
---
It's an exploit, but it's not a big one.  It's not that much better than just continuing to run around and look for more nodes.
---
Not quite the same, but I noticed a guy selling some decent gear that I was interested in for reasonably cheap.
---
So as expected I messaged him a about it, we met, agreed on the price and the transaction begun.
---
I entered the amount, he put the gear in and then a really good two-handed mace followed and then he confirmed the trade.
---
Afterward he whispered “A little freebie ;)”.
---
In my years playing from OG vanilla to now I’d never come across this kind of light-hearted generosity in-game.
---
And it helped re-affirm my decision to abandon retail and just stick with Classic from now on.
---
Needless to say I also friended the guy and I enjoy occasionally checking on his levelling progress.
---
Yes nothin new. Paladins and Druids (and even hunter pets) can tank dungeons but not HL raids
---
Oldie but goodie: Do not click your spells. Get yourself used to using the number keys to cast.
---
You can add more action bars by pressing Esc and clicking Interface &gt; Display. You’ll see the options available for you to check.
---
In keybindings under the menu (Esc) you can assign more keybindings to blank action bars. I personally like having my original numbers, then on another action bar having those same numbers+shift.
---
When using your spells keep tapping it instead of waiting for it to cast and do damage. This will reduce downtime between using your spells and allow you to do more damage and faster.
---
That's pretty cool, at least you can enjoy some WoW with your son together, I kinda hope that my future kids will enjoy video games too because it's a great opportunity for bonding with your child :)
---
Mobs are two levels above me, I'm using the level 5 wand I think it's called lesser magic wand.
---
I ALMOST have 2 whole golds at level 21, so I'm like, 2% there! Haa
---
Even as I alliance, same. Always punt the gnome. But leave the dwarves alone. They're cool.
---
You don't need to clear anything. All the Twitch app does is install the addons directly to the addon folder.
---
People don't have gold? What are you talking about. I've seen many people with their epic mount. If you think there's not enough gold, for 60s who would be using this preraid bis, you're delusional.
---
You can thank Monsanto for that one.
---
You could heal it now if you have a decent set of +int gear. You prob won't get into a pug though, take a guild group.
---
Your naming game is strong.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---

---
So you do not believe going with full sets of "of Arcane Wrath" gear would be worth it?
---
The fact that it was on github makes it even worse. Github allows you to look at the source code and know exactly what is going on. I found the github project and it literally says "** CAUTION - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF USERS HAVE BEEN BANNED **" in the first part of the readme. What were you thinking?????
---
Nothing really to do with to many zones and expansions and to be honest it's a lot of little things that have piled up over the years. 
---
It's just not an mmorpg in retail anymore it's more akin to diablo with Facebook game mechanics
---
nice, enjoy your tampon and dildo combo
---
They already aknowledged, that going BC and WotLK isn't as simple(from a gameplayperspective) as going classic. Because they are aware those expansions added things, people of classic dislike (dungeonfinder for example). And it seems they hint possible changes.

OH found it:

---
&gt;We’re looking into what would be required to support BC and WotLK  should we decide to go that route. The guiding principle for WoW Classic  was staying faithful to the original game.  
---
&gt;It’s less clear what our direction should be with BC and WotLK. As  you point out, it is likely that some features of these expansions will  not be universally embraced by the Classic community. We’ll be following  player progression and sentiment to help guide us in our next steps.

Today as a 33 warrior I gained half a level and made 1 Gold soloing quests. here are my pro tips:
---
1. Have a camera reset button to reset the camera behind your character. Its so vital for when your camera whacks out mid combat.
---
2.  Do green quests. I wsa able to solo a mine's worth of worgen in dusk wood, lvl 29's, because they were green... I even survived a pull of 3 mobs despite being on my phone and killed a rare mob that spawned - that wouldn't have bene the case had the quests been my level.
---
3. Shadowmeld is the best for mobile. Hostile players and mobs have run past me unknowingly because of it, making it easy to afk as one does when playing mobile.
---
4. I made a macro that tells ppl im on my phone if they sak me for help, not necessary but it blows peoples minds some time. lol
---
My friend put in a ticket saying the quest is bugged and he cant get all the pages.
---
He wasnt trying to get every page 1-28, he didn't know that they were "missing pages only".
---
Shit had me dying.
---
I thought there was azurite traits? On top of Titan forging?
---
 That's not as simple as will it drop. That more like, will it drop? Will it Titan? Will it have Azurite traits I need. BTW. The answer to all those quests being a yes is way too much RNG.
---
Its far from BiS though to be fully decked in PvP gear.
---
Also, will take a long ass journey to be fully kitted.
---
Great! See you on the battlefield alliance scum!

My thoughts exactly. Ya brah your safe, totally safe.
---
Questie. You can set it to show all level quests or withing a certain range.
---

---
While leveling, you definitely want more spirit at least as much as int, if not more. As a mage you burn through mana so fast, you generally are limited more by having to sit and drink instead of not having enough maximum mana. The tiny crit chance from int is negligible, so as long as you have enough int to reasonably kill mobs, the more spirit the better.
---
It absolutely depends on what you are doing. For 1v1, I don't actually think anything beats devouring plague. For PvE, well you are mostly a Shadow Weaving bot anyway but yes, troll would be better.
---
Dwarf priest beats all of them anyway because fear ward is OP in both PvE and PvP. But it's like one of the only cases where the Alliance has a racial advantage.
---
He had no mana issues and was playing defensively maybe?
---
Back in the day me and a friend (mage) were running SM (don't remember which wing) and the tank was really bad, my friend pulled agro quite a few times.
---
At this point i had fair gear and played decently so me I promised my friend he could he wouldn't die, we did the run without much issues, my friend agro'ed constantly but PW:S a few good heals and good dps  group allowed us to do the run easily. The tank wasn't terrible though he just sucked at keeping agro when tanking a group of mobs.

Fucking _Apple_ doesnt have any control over their shit in China. Neither did Google or literally anyone else. In order to do business in China, you give up everything, you give up your code, your ip, your blueprints, literally _everything_. And you profit, for a few years until randomly a Chinese govt owned company shows up selling an exact replica of what you are. Then you get run out of town

Illuminati confirmed

2 hours maybe
---
I don't think so. I looked up Kargoz' guide on classic.live which suggests using a sit macro, so I would assume he's going off private server data when that still worked.
---
Frankly I'm not a big fan of the guy, his shaman guide had a lot of questionable suggestions in it too. I would definitely advise against a reckoning build if you're solo leveling.
---
\**Laughs in warrior**
---
It's a good thing that Devilsaur Leather is the only exploitable material then. Oh, wait.
---
I did this accidentally in the first cave I was ever in after starting out as a new player, didnt know that chests didnt share the loot or notixe someone asking to roll, felt really bad about it! But I've made sure to always wait and do the roll thing since then!
---
You can take a copy of a letter that has been mailed to you. It becomes an item.
---
Im playing shaman for the first time in classic.
---
I just hit 20 and finally feel like im really ramping up. I can't wait for the legendary Windfury totem though
---
&gt; For this level range, there are many zones to choose from and it is not uncommon to travel to several of them. Feralas and Stranglethorn Vale offer the most quests ranging from the early to mid 40's, although a handful of early 40's quests can be found in Badlands, Swamp of Sorrows, and Tanaris.

---
I only played PvE servers in vanilla, decided to do PvP this time around so I have something to do while I wait for WSG to get released. Sometimes I question this decision.
---
Ok honestly, are you just trolling at this point, or do you really not understand how it works?
---
It does not matter, at all, how many people can fit on a single layer.  It does not matter, at all how, many layers blizzard puts on a server.  A server has a maximum number of allowed total players that can be logged in at the same time.  All layering does is distribute those players so that the world itself is not overcrowded.  If a realm can host 125k players at one time, removing layering does not suddenly mean the realm cannot host 125k players, they would all just be competing directly on that single world instance instead of the multiple instances being run on multiple layers.
---
&gt; I didn't know this bag of white powder someone was paying me to stick up my put and sneak into the country was drugs! How was i supposed to know?!
---
That's what you sound like.
---
If I'm a gnome warlock I can still get the mechostrider thing right?
---
That's the impression I got as well.  It seems pretty clear that regardless of future changes, they aren't actually gonna punish anyone who's been doing this.  Feels bad man.
---
Right dude. I've got a lvl 10 rogue(I only play him when my one friend is on) and a 19 hunter...i couldn't imagine how much meth I'd need to smoke in order to accomplish what this dude did in a week and a half
---
Free mount + PvP Dots make up for it :)
---
I usually tip a summon so I don't always leave the locks out!
---
I just like running around with six buffs... thats ehy i took alchemy, haha.
---
Yep pretending hes onto me. What a gem
---
!RemindMe 4 hours
---
I have a lvl 26 Druid. I always keep myself buffed. Bit didn’t know motw was’OP’
---
The same reason people sub to a streamer that is a big time full time streamer. I mean mr. 25k subs doesn’t need another $3 or so he makes from your sub. 
---
But that streamer with 100 subs does need the sub. Yet the 25k one will hit 26k before the 100 one goes up much.
---
So it’s the same mindset. Give the person you watch stuff/money because you enjoy watching them.
---
Yep, exactly. It was fairly common to see people with a mix of pvp/pve gear regardless if they were raiding or in PvP, it was just normal.  
---
You can look at what's BiS for your class and then decide something like... "It's going to take me forever to get my BiS shoulders from X raid, so I'll just get the PvP shoulders first and work towards upgrading them later"
---
i blame blizzard for not understanding that expansions should expand the game, not replace.
---
It was a post a while back when they expanded the realms in August. I don’t have a link though. If anyone else can chime in 👌🏻
---
Oh the irony m8. The irony...
---
Thankful Blizz said something on the issue. Was starting to worry a bit!
---
You cast it on yourself, so you can then dispel everyone who’s currently still feared and running (the high priority people)
---
Dont be like me and stubbornly level as a holy priest. Just go shadow and respec later, nobody will think less of you.
---
Most Don't bind until you equip them.
---
and what if lets say the button is shift-4, and you have / cast mod:alt, and just /cast. would pressing shift4 cast the no mod, and pressing alt-shift 4 cast the mod?
---
Curseforge.com is good

The last spawn of the briathorn on live vanilla 15 years ago. My how has it grown!!

6 int is around 50mana. And most healing spells have good +heal ratios. So i guess its fir u to chose, but i would argue +14 is better

You don’t need to clear anything with the twitch addon handler

Thank you for that idea, kind stranger! I’ll definitely do that if it takes me too long.

Grind every turtle on the way back from Chillwind Point to Tarren Mill, obv. That's why they're there.
---
You act like that's a bad thing.
---
What happens if you die on the boat? I would guess don't release until the load screen, but then when you do release will your body lock in place floating somewhere over the water?
---
Speak for yourself. I have a bad habit of binge watching shows I like. WoW has been no different. My husband got me to play. I was immediately grinding out leveling. Solid three to four days in and almost level 16. Mind you, the last game I played on a semi-regular basis was DK Country on the Super Nintendo.
---
WHOOOOOOSH
---
Also seriously, if guns aren't the problem why are you responding to 4 little words with 10x that. Me thinks thou doth protest too much. (Also lovely downvote)
---
I do. It gives me better goals while leveling since I like to take my time. It makes questing/dungeon running feel more rewarding when you get that piece you know you won't be replacing for 10 levels or so.
---
Skills do most of the work but gear is also important. Why do you think twinking in battlegrounds was a thing? The gear matters and helps.
---
You just linked to a 6 hour video. Nobody is going to watch that.
---
I need quartz.
---
my net connection is stable, and it's not my PC.  This is something new that has been happening since yesterday, it was fine before then.
---
Twitch app i use vendorprice atlas loot threat meters and recount
---
To be fair I do not really struggle, but I feel that my eq starts lacking comparing to the levels prior
---
Why would a dwarf run to wetlands at lvl 1? 0.o
---
Mind control is some of the most fun of the whole game of WoW. Especially because you can use the other being’s skills. It’s just too bad it only works on humanoids.
---
Trolls are one of the most fun solo classes. 
---
Hell they are just fun. Regent is niiiiiice
---
Doesn't matter really, but his way the macro shows cd on riposte.
---
The fact that as far as I know he will ravage darkshire until hes dead?
---
Options are really limited. Since there aren't a lot of dungeons for each 10lvl step. So you would have to relay on world drops which makes it really expensive or you grind for those items, but will most likely out lvl the items during your grind.
---
If you just look for question and dungeon rewards it becames really simple. Since the option for each class,  will only be one or two items you have to choose between for most slots.
---
So no need for a list, just take what you get out of each dungeon for your lvl and check on quest rewards. LootAtlas addon will help you here.
---
I heard this crazy rumor that some Paladins actually get 4!  We should protest or something.
---
If you want to do high tier content with pugs, likely you're going to be pressured to heal.
---
If you stick to doing dungeons or have a good group that doesn't mind not min-maxing everything, you can probably get away with DPS/support or even try your hand at shaman tanking.
---
ArkInventory is available for classic too.
---
Mods?
---
Enjoy your ban I guess ?
---
Addons sure ?
---
Damn this is such a shame to hear, PDD was one of my favorite J4 players to watch in LoL.
---
Oh, that's too bad :(
---
Oh yeah totally. You’ll just have to pay for it normally. 
---
Be Careful though, if you want a dreads teed and a mechanostrider and you buy the strider first you’ll still have to pay all the costs of the warlock quest, which are equal to or more than the cost to buy a strider with training. 
---
So if you want both, and don’t want to pay double, get the dreadsteed first for the mount training that goes with it.
---
Curse forge is the best site I thinj.  Make sure you filter it to wow classic.  Must have add-ons I think are questie, dbm, auctioneer, theres also one that makes it easy to vendor unwanted items quickly.
---
I think the murdering of enemy players adds to the wholesomeness, they joined a PvP server for the sense of danger and your participation in PvP only adds to it! 
---
I think you're right though. People who have played WoW for a long time and feel disengaged from the community in retail can see exactly how special a thing we have going in classic and I think that just further encourages people to participate in the fun.
---
Not to mention new players have both great examples to take inspiration from, and a direct demonstration of the positive response to such behaviour. The default is helpful and engaged rather than apathetic.
---
my point is shadowform has nothing to do with this, i just accidentally had it off for the 2nd gif
---
This isn't newsworthy, if it was a chinese who is not breaking a rule you could probably get a price for finding one.
---
A friend from work rolled Horde there so I've been trying to make an alt to play with him, and just from the general chat in starting zones I get a bad feeling about that server. It's almost a constant stream of RL debates, arguing, and just general trash I would never expect to see on an RP server.
---
It's totally opposite to my main server, a PvP one, which has been nothing but chill and super helpful so far. Some of my best moments back in the day were on RP servers so it was a little disappointing to see.
---
I feel like a ton of people started playing there because so many other servers were flooded with huge queues on launch and it's just going to ruin it.
---
Disgusting ui
---
I'm seriously hoping this was just a joke some one decided to run with after a bong hit too many, 
---
or this was like an 8 year old or something.
---
And also on a 30s CD and 10 min duration. So basically not a budget version at all :)
---
A person replying to someone in an open forum. It's nowhere near what I did to that person.
---
Tell me how else to read this:
---
&gt;Grats, you are now playing the game correctly.
---
A smaller, densely populated world is far more fun, yes. Too many new continents makes them all into ghost towns.
---
I have a level 16 priest on Deviate Delight and I want to make a druid.
---
Should I make it on Incendious (I have a level 11 hunter on it) or on Deviate Delight?
---
I ask this because although both are PvP D.D is RP-PvP and is never at 'high' for players, so I worry about there not being world pvp.
---
I was leveling my leather working and running around trying to find people with worse gear last night and just giving it to them, cause someone did that for me. 
---
This community is awesome.
---
What? They are both air, no he can't....
---
Yep they're just brez bots
---
I find this statement not true .... Like a tank warrior can kill a rogue  3 lvls higher...  So unless skull .... Ain't nobody dying. At least If u have some skill
---
I feel like something of a new game + would have worked out better than new levels. So like, Warriors trading their 60 levels for an additional Death Knight talent tree and ten more talent points, then leveling up to 60 with maybe one new 1-20 starting zone added for plusers. Keep the world alive while maintaining progression to new raids/dungeons. Ah well.
---
Holy priests are a thing.
---
Bandages sell for more than just cloth. Even if it’s a cloth type you don’t need the bandages of anymore, take a second and convert them for extra silver.
---
I never played on a PVP server until Classic and I'm glad I made the switch.  A buddy told me with a PVE only server you're literally playing only half a game and he's right.
---

Can someone help me with point 7? Video, link/article, more detailed instructions. All I can drag is blank circles.

Okay let me rephrase if you want to kill rag week 1 you have to be a dwarf priest. Otherwise you can be any race
---
Lol at least the fall didn’t kill you
---
If it doesn't work now, hopefully it gets updated soon, I intend to use this feature.  Game is still new so a lot of Add-on Devs are trying to catch-up I am sure.
---
Am leveling as holy pally, shits hard... 
---
Only need roll healing gear or dps greens from trash
---
Nice. How do you move health bars etc around in elvui if I may ask?
---
Which is why you pull fairly large if you have the group for it. Your mana cost is the same, but you stretch that spending across more dps on more mobs.

Use the fucking print screen button REEEEEEEE

I mean almost any game supports it if you look in the right spot. It's why a lot of people get stuck playing shitty games they hate- because their friends are playing it and you are still having fun playing it because of your friends and not because of the game.

Next time you hop on your computer and before you jump in discord look at your steam/bnet game list and see which ones you actually feel like launching and playing solo.

I like this better. POAPS sounds too close to PROLAPSE.
---
Is there a mod that will allow me to make notes about a player and then have those notes appear in the friends list and in the tooltip when I mouse over them?
---
Could you elaborate on the zones in your 30s? I always struggle with that a bit.
---
I usually go do Shimmering Flats, then Southshore+Alterac low lvl quests, then North STV, then back to High lvl Alterac, then Arathi, then Booty Bay area, and I finally finish with Badlands.
---
Can you recommend a better route? (I know, Desolace, but that place hurts my soul...)
---
That's a shame, I've had the exact opposite experience - with most folks sticking around until everyone is done.   
---
Not that it really matters since you have to do a bit of grinding to stay ahead of the quest level curve anyhow tbh
---
Need to be 306 to gather it.
---
They're going to commit genocide?
---
Meanwhile, I got invited to a small group to share credit on a kill quest.  Loot was left to FFA, and one of my loot mobs happened to have a random no-big-deal green mace on him.  One party member berated the leader for putting it on FFA loot.  I said it was no big deal and that I'd be willing to roll for the item.   We all rolled, I lost, I traded it to the winner.  All good, right?
---
They then kicked me from the group and began cursing at me in /say chat.  
---
Never had such fond nostalgic feels in my life &lt;3
---
Most of the popular areas will be crowded, so AoE farming doesn't work extremely well all the time right now. You're best best for AoE farming was getting ahead fast before other people leveled, or waiting until everyone has already leveled. It still works, but just know there is more competition.  
---
If your friends are too low level, they will not be getting experience. You can get around this by not being in a party with them, letting them tag all the mobs, then you kill them. You get no xp for this, but they get the full amount.
---
I’m the opposite I thought I’d be bored and burnt out but for some reason I’m having a blasty blast

issue is that people know how to abuse layers and the wealth (which is greater because there is more demand as you point out) is heavily concentrated in a few players and guilds. they will sit on resources and have more gold than they’d ever need by phase 3.

They’re paid to be modern day jesters. They are all C-tier players who simply act like man children to get attention and yes they are paid well for it because it somehow appeals to people. But I don’t know why anyone would ever want to be paid for being a joke.
---
I disagree, if you put on the mantle of another role, perhaps to get into groups easier, you should also be willing to accept the loot of that role. And inversely I would be right pissed if a ret pally in a group started nabbing items from the healer on the assumption that he might heal later. If he wanted to heal, he should be healing. Likewise if you want to be damage dealing, do so. Trying to reap the benefits of both specs is by having one foot in each camp is a dick move to your other group mates who either don't have the option or *are* actually playing their main spec.
---
He's "that which has no life".
---
That wand is ~15% DPS increase over gravestone, I wouldn't target farm it unless you're already XP grinding there.
---
You get shadow weaving in 30s (which is exactly when you're going to start trying to replace gravestone scepter) and shadowform is 40. And wands are still quite relevant after that if you want to sustain mana.
---
What does empathy have to do with it? If people want to give away their gear/gold it's their choice.
---
Nah its because of the cross realm. Its basically just a path like in a standard computer file system. Or like “@gmail” type thing. Layering needs the same system because of the different layers.
---
if the resources were being evenly distributed your theory would make sense.
---
I think you'll be fine in Phase 2, but if not, twinking is the last refuge of the casual. Spend however much time you need to get BiS gear for your twink and never worry about being outpaced in a gear race.

Do we have a releasedate for Phase 2?

A word of advice. Open the interface tab and add a few more hot bars. If the way you have it works for you, great! but adding a couple more will make yours a little less of a cluster
---
This is a horrible mentality. What you’re describing is needing on an item for the definition of “Greed”.
---
It’s pretty bad! I will probably transfer in the future when possible to a alliance dominated server!

All fine dude, if thinking your pianist skill killing NPCs with simple agression scripts makes you skilled then all the power to you, enjoy the high.

Mage AoE leveling isnt the same as Warrior leveling. 2 Different worlds, being compared, is the lack of understanding here. Regardless, have fun with whatever you decide to inefficiently level, consistency is not that fun after all

This is why I stay in stealth 90% of the time.
---
Yeah yeah we've all seen world of rogue craft.
---
Honestly everyone in that video was super sub par, and rank 14 only means you have the most time, and the best guild.. it is not an actual test of your personal ability.
---
Youll notice in the video he mostly targets people whos class cant trinket stun, and its a lot of bleeding and a base damage ability thst isnt gear dependant so it hits as hard as it always will. 
---
Youre also using information of 1v1s.. which Rogues dominate
---
I am not saying rogues arent the top tier, but youre using a lot of targeted things to form your bias. Like documentaries that only show one side its easy to be walked towards one idea lol rogues arent unkilable but the game definitely isnt balanced for 1v1s
---
Tailoring has high level cloth armor recipes thay you absolutely need. Highly recommended you do that, because many are what's called "best-in-slot" or BiS. 
---
Enchanting as a great combination progression with that.

Tailoring is also nice for bags, everyone needs bags!

Wow that monitor, you're really going for that 2004 experience

It would be like horde in Classic without Paladins? There is a reason most of the world firsts in Original were all Alliance. As for sunwell, remember that fight was designed with both sides having shaman in mind, if both sides didn't have shaman they would have balanced it differently.
---

Nice!! Haha I was the same and ended up having ~105g when I dinged last night. Still sitting at 7g after buying my mount and training lvl40 abilities. Once I have a bit more again I need to finally buy artisan skinning since I refused to shell out the 5g for it before getting my mount lol. Grats on your upcoming ding and mount tonight! 😃
---
Haven’t you done the battle of hillsbrad quests? It’s World of WARcraft after all
---
You don’t decide what the classic experience is. The casual/low IQ experience is NOT the classic experience.
---
Hopefully never. Your server is your commitment and an appeal of classic is as few people reinventing themselves as possible.

That’s what I’m referring to. Cross realm in retail.

I couldn't ignore my cats if I wanted too. They're the poster child of /r/catswhoyell one even stands on his hind legs and taps me on the shoulder if I'm not paying him enough attention while on the computer.

also interested in this so pls let me know
---
Run a trace route and see if you're dropping packets. That will let you see if your internet is acting up.
---
Yeah this is a bad bug. Surprised it hasn't been hotfixed. I'm sure they know about it though.
---
A little bi you say?
---
What would be a lot of bi?
---
I'm on the RPPVP, and "low" is probably relative. We might get less layering so the world feels the same as a full server.
---
Fuck dude I feel that. Just started my PhD and I've already dumped 2 days of gameplay into my mage.
---
With Bartender you go to the visibility tab for the bar, check the fade out box, and set the fade out alpha to 0%.
---
I assume it makes them feel better about their own lives by being prejudicial towards someone they perceive as not normal.
---
Yes its because of the layers.
---
Not if the ability cant go off... Like lack of energy or distance.
---
The macro at least starts your white hits as soon as possible
---
The number of UD that have timely reactions to this is what always surprises me about these MC clips. There's usually just as many UD clips as any other race. Granted, there's tons of UD, so there's bound to be some slow ones, but there's no reason why an UD should ever get MC'd off, really.
---
You could start a petition.

I was farming boar meat to level up cooking so I could make Thistle tea on my rogue. A low level warlock asked if I would help him kill a camp of mobs for a quest. I agreed and off we set, he asked what I was doing in a low level area and I told him about my culinary quest. He opened trade and dropped 20 boar meat into it. I was ecstatic as I could get back to leveling a lot sooner. We killed the camp no problem and I went back to town to level up my cooking. I had about 4 stacks of cooked meat so I sent it to my new friend. He sent me back a very nice letter and it just make me feel great about the community that we are building!
---
&gt;The guy struck me as a toolbag **the first time I heard him speak**. No sleep lost over that **fucking dweeb.**
---
Don't you worry mate, you are coming across much better
---
Yeah, you get bear form at ten and it’s tank time from there on out :)
---
On which subreddit are you reading this?
---
&gt; Stance 1 is bear, 2 is aquatic, 3 is cat. I think 4 is travel and 5 moonkin, but you may want to check that.
---
So the easiest way to tell these is that 0 = caster, the rest are in the exact same order that they are on your stance bar. If for example you skip the quest for aquatic form then Cat is 2, Travel is 3, etc. Generally though this is correct. I also like to use form for the modifier since it's shorter than stance and works exactly the same.
---
Also agree on the context. If it was FFA and he just took it, dick move. If it was in a chest he won the roll for, not a dick move.
---
I can't tell if you are serious or not, but no, you will not get banned for looking at the github page.

I totally get that. The third time I had to do that corpse run I straight up rage quit The Barrens

Don’t forget to get Greater Magic Wand at level 13. 😁

I found an enchanter and gave him the mats which was cheaper for me (had a greater magic essence from a disenchant)

Just praying in that pulse that never comes lol
---
2 monitors lol.
---
Exactly this
---
Haha i've been there for the past 3 days. Died so many times, but still love the game so much it'll make me homeless.
---
aww, poor baby
---
Very much so. Druids are GREAT dungeon tanks.
---
You downrank skills that provide utility where you don't need the damage to conserve mana like frost nova or rank 1 frostbolt for decreased cast time to toss out a slow fast.
---
It's an option, you can show them or not.
---
Good in your opinion, maybe. All those traits you just listed sound horrible to have on a pvp server in a violent online video game.
---
Classic wow
---
That's a pretty cool name, yes.
---
What drugs are you on?
---
I dunno. Their dps is always tops single target and saps are really useful. People just get caught up in the aoe trash mentality. When unless you are outgearing yourself nonstop it’s probably better in the long run to bring diverse dps to not compete for drops.
---
As rogue I sometimes run in, cheap shot, rupture and then keep running. Nice little stun and dot to help out.
---
It appears slower to me,  but I think it’s visual only as if I look at my bar, I see it triggering correctly
---
Wanting rewards for every little thing. This is how we got retail.  
---
Why not just enjoy the battles for what they are ? Players versus Player. I enjoy the fact that the pvp is strictly due to hate of the other faction. Not a reward system.
---
As someone with a 22 mage and 18 warrior I feel personally attacked...
---

Not really worth it at this point in the game.

Paid server transfers existed in Vanilla. Stop projecting your idea of what Classic should be, it's absurd.

/cast [@player] Rain of Fire

and replace Rain of Fire with blizzard for mage

Winterspring
---
That’s not enough info to differentiate it though.
---
Character A is on layer 1
---
Char B is on layer 2
---
It’s confirmed there are single digit (but multiple) layers per server. Not just 2. For your scenario to be proof, there would need to be several “blankname@servername-XYZ” but I personally have not seen that and I’ve seen the servername come up several times. 
---
So are you seeing extra items in that name?
---
Funny, it was Tauren who convinced Thrall to allow the Forsaken to join the horde.

---
There are more as well.
---
Yeah I'm ok, done here.  You're a fucking retard. 
---
&gt;Read the link at the top of my first post where it says LOW SINGLE DIGIT layers.
---
The number of layers, as I've said, is irrelevant to the derivative.  You kept mentioning it as if it means something or that I'm not reading it.  This is the third time I've addressed it.  What matters is the change in number of active players.
---
&gt;Blizzard has ACTIVELY REMOVED layers since launch and is continuing to do as we get closer and closer to a stable population for phase 2.
---
You have no proof of this and I have proof of the opposite.  They increased layers to help with queue times.
---
&gt;Sure it's partly cause of that
---
At least you admit you are wrong.
---
*Cries in Bloodhoof*
---
Thats nice, what do yoy want us to do about it lol
---
I'm not saying I agree with that reasoning, I was just offering a possible explanation.
---
You know how meta forms, someone says "druids can't ress they are bad healers" and everybody follows mindlessly.
---
I had a hunter in my deadmines group who needed ammo (prot warrior) I gave him a stack and later that night he mailed me the more expensive shots
---
Red is dead, but if you're grey, you're OK
---
I concur.
---
Yeah forgot to mention that, good call
---
Lol by your definition it's not the same. One is a job, the other is not
---
It doesn't matter that much considering how little melee you use. If you Dual Wield you better do it for the stats or some kind of amazing proc weapon. Otherwise you're better off with a 2H to maximize your  melee against opponents on the rare occasion you have to use it.
---
Yes. We saw it run away and it was marked with a skull. We didn't leave combat until we killed it. And it was still running away when we got to it. We had to stunlock it and dps it down cause it kept trying to run further into the dungeon.
---
I used to do that back in the day but no one ganked me yet so i guess we will see if i will do that still xD
---
Yeah I tanked RFC, WC and SFK w my feral druid. Was ez— druids arent that bad but not too great at endgame.. wait until they release BC classic, druids will come out in top
---
Warriors can very much handle themselves in PvP, that said having a pocket healer adds a level of consistency that make them that much harder to kill. But it is not necessary to have a healer in order to be successful as a warrior.
---
Those counts are really not that much. A drop in the bucket as far as the economy is concerned.
---
Players always get a head start if they get high level fast. That's just the nature of MMOs. Nobody else is there.
---
These add-ons were available in vanilla. What are you going on about? Use the add-ons or don't. Don't tell other people how to play the game.

Ugh I bought 300 skinning last night at lvl 34 without thinking about it bc it was late. Kicking myself this morning.
---
Ele resto is fine as long as your not in the range group, if your healing and in the range group you will need to drop mana tide.
---
If you want to go 30/0/21 then speak to raid leader beforehand and ask for Meele group if your specced like this
---
*succubus has entered the chat*
---
What’s the name of that bag add on?
---
Yes, spirit gear with spirit tap will keep you going nonstop. When you group with a friend, ask them to leave the last 10% or so HP of mobs for you to finish so it keeps proccing- you need the killing blow. Then it’s smooth
---
Roth UI is very visually pleasing, but I find it changes the experience considerably.
---
Druid is still tier 1 in solo, right behind lock and hunter...
---
sSunds like the most boring experience glad you enjoyed it though just not for me. so i won't watch him fish for 2 hours because I don't like it. hint hint
---
I tried at the weaponmaster in stormwind earlier, but he told me I could train staffs in darnassus? First time playing wow so I haven’t been before
---
Would it be considered a dick move to roll for it even though you didn't need to equip it? I mean everyone needs the epic mount :P
---
you get corruption at level 4
---
Not sure how much damage I did to Teremus, but he was definitely tapped.  I did get lost and this was after Blizz had claimed to have 'leashed' everything.  Either they forgot, figured with Teremus it wasn't worth the effort (either on their behalf or mine, the loot was absolutely crap, but I did split it with the druid that assisted me) or perhaps think this is funny.
---
I thought it was great fun, but again this was pretty much solely for the 'sport' of it.  Also as a side note I did this in a very active PvP server so thousands of thing could have gone wrong. 
---
Hilariously when I finally got him to the throne room he nuked down the guard that are not guards and it took Bolvar three good tries to get him down.  Teremus heals when something nearby dies (which is why simply kiting him to the alliance friendly mobs and FP npc in Blasted lands does not work.
---
Had this issue in WC. A druid was at 3% health, and just kept running away from us. Didn't agro any mobs, but we were stuck in combat.
---
They are the preferred tank for 5 mans lol
---
I ran deadmines last week with a full random group and the druid disconnected midway as he ran out of mobile data and by the time he had paid for extra and relogged he was in queue. I couldn't get him any boss loot as a result but we did gather up all the boe leather greens and I sent them to him with a little note saying basically we assumed his data ran out and he got sent to the queue etc but here's some consolation loot because he was a real nice guy and a few days later he sent a letter back basically saying yup he did run out of data and get slapped into the queue after he purchased another data package but he was real grateful for the spare greens and although he couldn't use most of them he did split them up among his guild.
---
It's these types of interactions I've missed most whereby very small acts of kindness can go a long way to making someone's day a little brighter. It's quite special to be part of it and I'm glad that he managed to pay that forward by handing out the spare gear to his guildmates. It's been a really enjoyable experience so far and even the fact that my 3 man group had to kill about 100 kobolds to get the stupid ears for Mountaineer Kardrell I've loved every minute of it and wouldn't care if they scrapped retail and made us start again from the beginning.
---
The best server!
---
About how he reads past the OP and makes assumptions because he's 8 and doesn't understand how the world works yet.
---
If you are working with medical data or social security data then that is fairly common.
---
thx a lot - now i'm really excited to try out all the things i didn'T 15 years ago \^\^
---
i miss the days when the merits of PvP were based on the experience and not the points you gained. I'm loving world PvP right now, just like I did in the pre-BG vanilla days and it's a shame people feel like they need some carrot dangling in front of them to participate.
---
Mine is called Pharisien, which is pharisian in french if anyone knows his bible.
---
Gnomercy was actually an infamous Gnome Warrior on my Vanilla server. He "one shotted" my 60 Rogue one time in STV. Charge + Mortal Strike Crit + AA crit + Sword spec proc crit all in the matter of less than a second over 3k damage lol
---
Really this.  It’s so much easier to see 10 pages of light leather as:

Light Leather - 180 stacks of 1 - 20 copper - Buy?
---
Light Leather - 290 stacks of 1 - 21 copper - Buy?
---
Light Leather - 1 stack of 20 - 24 copper (4s80c total) - Buy?
---
I mean what kind of pvp are we talking about?  Warriors are weak solo most classes have the tools to handle them  and some like mages and priests just take a big ol shit on them.
---
Any group pvp you go into will usually have some healed and they usually know to give wars a bit of special attention.
---
They have to spam it more because they get fewer replies, would be my guess
---
No, it is still with it.  Hopefully you are running to the side and not backpedaling
---
Yeah, I rolled priest because I didn’t want to wait for groups and tank seems like the biggest bottleneck on Benediction-Horde. I started rolling Druid since Druid tanking isn’t bad for non-raid content.
---
The phases will come out according to the PvE schedule. As always, PvP is not a consideration for the release schedule of wow.
---
We will not be getting phase 2 until they're ready to give the community dire maul gear.
---
This is great
---
Huh that's pretty funny haha
---
I wish I had some examples of this in retail WoW, because I've heard the game is also handled very differently over there in many aspects, even to the point where game time is bought in [minutes played versus monthly access](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4vh409/chinese_server_just_announced_the_change_of). 
---
It's a completely different market and they prioritize different issues, catching cheaters is not often high on the priority list.
---
I started in Wrath. He was around 4 at the time and loved watching me play. It was a great experience. He loves animals and after I showed him the shapeshifting he only wanted to see me playing my druid. To this day I always main a druid.
---
Trust me though, it's not always magical when your spawn is 15. Even when you share interests there is a lot of drama.
---
Yea thats the copypasta
---
I don't think the majority of the classic population dislikes dungeon finder, or dislikes a lot of the QOL improvements made. 20 man raids are much more sustainable than 40.      
---
Speaking for myself, I disliked the homogenization of all the classes, everyone gets a heal, everyone can do everything equally well. Death Knights were also really unbalanced when I quit the game, the explosion of different types of mounts, the dailies, etc....
---
Horde rogue ganking a solo alliance member I had +5 levels on...towards the end of an escort quest they were doing.
---
I suggest making a check list of things you want to have taken care of before you play. Is it important to you to have worked out? Eaten real food? Cleaned your home? Spent quality time with your loved ones? Make that list. Don't play ever, at all, until that list is done for the day.  
---
Pick a WoW Bedtime. I also have a very addictive personality, and having a strict night-time cut-off point really helps me, personally. Instead of just playing until you're tired, or you feel like you *have* to go to sleep to function tomorrow at a minimum level, choose a time to be done. My WoW bedtime is 9PM. I have an alarm that goes off at 8:50 on weekdays so I can wrap up what I'm doing and hearth somewhere safe. Then I have time to read (which is important to me, but your thing might be puzzles or board games or yoga-- whatever) and time to relax without a screen glaring at my face before bed. Weekends I'm more flexible about it, but I'm a person who needs my sleep-- I still often am in bed before the rest of my team has even thought about logging out.
---
If you can't do those things-- you probably shouldn't play. WoW should not get in the way of your work, health, or relationships. Anything that gets in the way of those things has gone too far.
---
My wife and I were both working lower salary positions but were also living in a generally low income area and didn’t have much debt. The cost of living was low and we still were able to save with what we made. Two incomes is definitely what made it realistically possible. 
---
That being said, you don’t have to do a boot camp to learn how to code. There are many cheaper options that work just as well, depending on what type of person you are. I have an addictive personality (maybe why I like WoW?) and needed to really immerse myself in it because that’s just how I do things, but we’re all different. 
---
A boot camp was great for my specific situation, but it won’t be for everyone.
---
They’re basically tech support for the game. It’s not GM responsibility to tell you where to pick the quest up after abandoning.
---
Thanks! I'll be heading out there soon, so I'll try and get my tank bud to farm with me a bit. As a mage, it shouldn't be a problem. :') I wish that were me with greens, but unfortunately I haven't had anything to DE in a long time. RIP enchanting. I guess I'll have to level it later.
---
Sounds like you should change factions, Benedict.
---
I didn't know thinking someone else's behavior was pathetic was a form of psychoanalysis.
---
Um enh sham for winfury totem (and the talents that buff it) is fun. Also really helpful in a melee heavy group.
---
I mean, yes you can. I've been healing as a Shadow Priest every single dungeon. And as long as you stay out of Shadowform and don't cast Mind Blast then nobody will be able to tell that you don't have Holy or Disc talents anyway.
---
Alliance does it too man. God knows you guys have ganked me plenty of times.
---
Teachers telling me to knuckle down and not waste my time playing games.
---
Now I am said teacher, telling my pupils to stop wasting their times and do something productive. I then go home and wait in a que to play this glorious game. Life is good.
---
Depends on classes, my lock is about 20 with 11 hr played and that's with a few hour messing around in rfc. That's true you can follow guide and questie. The main thing with classic is to enjoy the adventure and group with ppl to have fun and help each other. Dump the retail way of thinking, it's more rewarding and challenge. 
---
If you are stuck at a level, go find a group and do a dungeon which might take over a hour but it's way more fun then grinding mob after mob.
---
Lol, i still have nightmares from EQ1 corpse runs.
---
I was thinking more from a health of the MMO perspective, but I definitely agree with you from a lore perspective, wholeheartedly.
---
If you choose to believe the bullshit that comes out of this companies mouth, be my guest. As I said, layering has, just by definition, a very negative impact on the economy. But please continue to lick blizzard's asshole my little fanboy.
---
Alright I’ll test out both!
---
Yeah generally people tend to RP more when there’s nothing productive to be doing.
---
Like when new raid tiers come out, or new expansions, you usually see drops in RP. Meanwhile, the tail end of expansions tends to be the best time if you ask me.
---
Same. I think I got it out of my system then, thank god.
---
This right here is what made me love this game. The way they tied NPCs together and breathed life into the world as a whole
---
Of course a night elf priest posts this
---
Fel Gods sure, but gods nonetheless.
---
what is the drop rate for the pattern like? ill eventually try to make it. only lvl 34ish now but eventually!
---
Trying to get my rocks off
---
When you learn a new rank of a spell, make sure to drag it on your bars! This sounds silly if you're aware that the game doesn't do it for you but I have found a lot of people who have no idea.
---
Why does this picture make me want tog reroll??
---
This has been my desktop background for a couple months now. LOVE it. Had an old buddy ask what it was who had played with me back in the day and I just responded "...dude...It's fucking IF you twat"
---
*Cries while Plainsrunning away*
---
The amount of people in barrens chat purity testing and yelling at other players for using addons has astonished me. We almost all used addons in vanilla ffs! Like, you do you, go without addons if you want, but let's not rewrite history here.
---
Ah.... Well that's just not smart.
---
They cant see you if you stand still fyi
---
Nice mate. Resorting to personal attacks, have a good one!
---
Near 100 percent.
---
I only find it annoying when some stupid meta takes over how others can play the game. For example this spellcleave / melee cleave bullshit. Really hard to get into groups for certain classes when that never happened originally.
---
imagine imagining imagination so you can imagine how i am imagining this imagination
---
Now that's a wet booty
---
It wasn’t the expansions. Expansions and new worlds are great. It was the over simplification of talents, abilities, professions (to the point they became useless); the homogenization of classes, and quality of life changes. 
---
Over simplification created convenience that blizzard thought we wanted. No skill ranks, no purchasing skills, the talent trees “became too large” so they “made all the stat stick talents baseline”, and so on. I think people like the perception of decision making (purchasing skills and “learning” them from a trainer instead of randomly knowing how to do a new spell for no other reason except you’re a level higher now, and choosing talents that can sometimes be a difficult choice). For me, a great example is the improved aspect of the monkey talent for hunters. No one gets it, but now that I’m getting my ass beat by harpies and PvP, suddenly it seems appealing to have +15% dodge. Blizzard’s simplification got rid of these decisions along with many abilities that were seen as niche or useless but bright immersion to the class system. 
---
The homogenization of classes did not help retail. Blizzard’s thought process was “being the player, not the class”, but I think the majority liked the idea that each class (and in many cases, each spec) brought something unique that no other class or spec brought. Bloodlust used to be shaman only. Then mages got it. Then hunters got it. Shamans used to be a bard-like support class with their totems. Now shamans don’t even have to use totems. 5-60 minute buffs no longer exist, and so on. The only difference in classes in retail is the ability rotation and flavor. 
---
Lastly, the increase in quality of life additions killed the mmo portion of WoW. I’ve played retail since TBC. Back in tbc and wotlk, we had to communicate, schedule, align the planets, strategize, and so on. Now? I play the game one player with no friends. A friends list with people that haven’t logged in in years. I can queue for everything wherever I am. I don’t even have to talk to anyone in the party/raid. Even if I piss them off, it doesn’t matter - they’re probably on another realm and I’ll never see them again. Dungeon Finder, Raid Finder, god-level questing from 1-120 (with or without heirloom gear), and other quality of life changes have made it where you don’t need help or groups or friends or anything. 
---
Classic has none of that. It has class unique identities, decision making, community communication, and much more. 
---
In my perfect world (of Warcraft), classic would make buffs to the 3 hybrid classes and their meme specs to make them viable, or release classic tbc and classic wotlk with no changes. It is at Cata that too many unwanted changes cake. Group Finder. The removal of the talent trees, the removal of weapon skill training, ability training/ranks, etc. Sure it would be silly to have rank 30 Frost bolt in BfA, but instead of removing it, evolve the UI with dropdown lists or something to clean up the spellbook. Don’t just remove all the “decision-making” from the game’s world. Retail just focuses on dps/hps rotation and lottery loot now. With portals everywhere, there’s barely a world outside the current expansion’s zones and so all those old worlds are dead and empty.
---
Nah- it’s fun as hell for wpvp, raids need at least one, and you can always go back to healing if you realize you aren’t getting groups!
---
How do you kill yourself? I get life tap, but I didn’t know you could die from it
---
Dude I was grinding out a crimson welp (I got it!) yesterday and an alliance druid saw I was killing the wrong type of enemy and MADE A HORDE TOON TO WHISPER ME. What a nice guy!
---
No problem man, glad I can help some people. If only there was a way to get this stickied so people that have this question can get it easily answered..
---
I swear I remember that name.  Man it’s been so long haha.
---
Nothing will compare to the Burning Crusade expansion for me, it was the best sequel to any game, ever.
---
I'll check it out! Thanks.
---
Is this surprising? Most of the people still queueing on the mega servers probably have a good reason. They won't transfer to a completely new realm on a whim.
---
i went menethil to theramore but that seem like a good way too.
---
Oh noooo
---
I doubt it would happen, but it's a shame 1/General was OOC and we used 2/Trade was ICC only.  Just an official unofficial rule.
---
uwu
---
Until they hit 60, and find out that tanks/healers are rare as hell, and they'll take a shaman tank with a bandage spec rogue if it means getting to do the dungeon at all.
---
This guy STVs.
---
Most pvp servers have a horde majority, so if you want the minority faction or want to balance things choose alliance.
---
More world pvp, faster bg queues, and they are stronger in pve too.
---
You've lived a good life
---
Yeah that's kinda what I thought.  I'm pretty good at getting last hits for spirit tap so I have been going for spirit.  Also would rather not spend money on drinks.
---
I'm pretty sure I said "fuck this game" at least every fucking time a mob resists my fucking starfire.
---
THAT SHIT IS EXPENSIVE YOU GARBAGE YOU ARE CODED TO DIE FOR ME
---
.....STOP.....

\*rage moonfire spam\*

Unless my brain is warped from years of pvp the only difference between max rank and rank 1 is damage and mana cost and both are pretty negligible.

Blizz needs to ensure that something happens for this realm. Collapse it back, roll other xfers into it, do something. These people are the worst kind of screwed if nothing happens.

It won't work on my server. Stacks of mageweave are going for 2g+/ea and the bags are selling for less than that (1g70s). Everyone just AHs their mageweave and I can't afford to buy it right now. RIP.
---
I'm past silk now, but I might go farm it just to make greens to DE.
---
That staff is going for 90g on my server. God I wish I could get it so I could flip it in 6 months
---
My philosophy is "Live and let live, unless you attack me. Then you go on the list."
---
Do you think frost has higher DPs? Considering switching from fire
---
This is the wow experience I've always wanted.
---
This is actually one of the meta-est things I've seen, not gon lie. 10/10 will read again.
---
Ignore these retards on reddit. I feel the same 4-5 months might be to long
---
Oh I found it: Carbonite. It had more than the questing bits but I usually turned those off.
---
I’m angry at the 100 retards posting there fucking cat pictures like they actually think there the first ones.
---
i'm on the same boat lol 
---
lvl 20 human warrior
---
lvl 19 dwarf priest
---
lvl 14 human paladin
---
lvl 13 night elf druid
---
Well be prepared. It happened to me so often in Vanilla I rolled a priest. 
---
Wait until you try to go do MC, ubers,lbers or brd and you get MCd off of chains in lava 4 times in a row and have to pay a big dumb repair bill for it.
---
Oh yeah. I'm not saying i'm an over the top fan of the default cave man ui, it's just, meh not worried about it atm is all, i do love your look.
---
My three year old asked me why I was killing pirates that were just just hanging around in VC. I said because they were the "bad guys". She said "the pirates were just having fun YOU'RE THE BAD GUY!". It was then promptly nap time.
---
I'm leveling feral right now and IMO bear tanking is easier than warrior tanking.  
---
No need to stance-dance
---
Regular leveling talents synergize better with defensive abilities (thick hide for example can be taken at lower levels, or the +rage when crit bear ability)
---
Reliable stun, and useful interrupt (feral charge)
---
Varied types of range pull (wrath, moonfire, or faerie fire)
---
pre-hots can generate AOE threat
---
Thorns aggro and a single demo roar can hold threat on non-focus targets
---
As horde, warstomp+regrowth and back into bear form can be an EXCELLENT use of cooldowns, you just have to use it when you're above like 20-30% HP as you will probably still take a couple hits.
---
Ok, the joke about Brianthorn is very good. Yet I have a question for you, are you an alien? Or how can you easily press K in combat?!
---
Bye random person I never heard of
---
Turns out he’s a vet himself and wants to be put on a pedestal lol
---
It’s entirely possible
---
Maybe Im wrong on this but I remember several streamers saying that blizzard normalized the pets by 1.12. Aka lupos does physical damage and broken tooth has the same atk speed as every other cat.
---
Me and my formerly ignorant 33 years give you all of the praise
---
It would ruin the immersion if they blatantly told you exactly where to go and who to talk to
---
That’s the reason I chose it too haha. And it’s good to be able to heal yourself quickly during combat as a rouge.
---
Limited quantity vendors vary by vendor. Some take 5 minutes, some can take hours. Depends on the vendor, depends on the item.
---
lol, I used to do this all the time back in 2005. I'd usually wait for it to get way out there and do a /goodbye right before doing it.
---
Once, I did it very close to where the loading screen hits for the next area and this poor Orc glitched and spawned half way around the world about 4000 feet in the air. I had no idea that was going to happen, and it was the only time it happened. I still had him on mind control so I watched him fall to his death in the middle of nowhere. Now that was the greatest moment of my life!
---
as other have pointed out that seems to be wrong
---
Right; it appears the site was thrown together quickly so as to provide a data dump destination.
---
Formatting, classification, etc... they can all use work. Fortunately, it's something the author ought to be able to massage if (s)he finds the time. I'm guessing they chose not to because they expect the addon's site to reappear.
---
I mean, the data is there... it's now all about how it is represented and, I too, would love for a sexy, well-maintained site to pop up around this addon's data... be it the author's site or some third party.
---
Is this a pic of my character???
---
Not in my experience. I'm level 31 atm and most of the time I can't  even put up all three dots without pulling aggro (yes I've upgraded the VW's abilities). Only way I can comfortably SB while questing is if I fear the mob.
---
No, that's just hilarious trolling.
---
How many people on an EST server play at noon on a work/school day on a 2 day old server? If it’s 300 at 8pm tonight then maybe worry
---
I ran it with a shaman tank/Hunter off tank. Then another group had two warriors that refused to tank because they weren't specced for it. 
---
It's crazy to see the difference in OGs vs. people that only played during later expansions.
---
If they wanted the kill why didn't they tag it faster than my targeting moonfire macro on infinite scrollwheel?
---
English please
---
What's the rush? There's two raids to do at max level, and a few dungeons. We don't even have all the *leveling dungeons* available yet, or all the quests for them, at least. We don't have battlegrounds or an honor system.
---
If you're enjoying your game time, you're playing the game right. If you absolutely need to be max level as soon as is absolutely possible, then there's probably addons (I know Azeroth Auto Pilot has a Classic port) or leveling guides available online. Be forewarned, though, that there are *not* a tremendous amount of people at high level yet, and those that are already are the ones who took time off from other things, sat down, and no-lifed the game for a week at the least. :P You'll probably find way more people to run leveling dungeons with than you will anyone to run max-level content with for a decent while.
---
Basically, though, if leveling takes you a week or three months, the endgame raids and dungeons will still be there. Rushing to max level will leave you less people to play with until the majority of the playerbase gets high-level characters. Judging by the responses here, most people aren't max level and are still leveling. Optimize your playtime and streamline your gameplay if you want, that's fine. But don't use what other people have accomplished as any kind of measuring stick against what you've accomplished so far. Again, if you're having fun, you're *doing it right*. ;)
---
Araga - Alterac Mountains ~ 34-35 rare.
---
Sin'Dall - Stranglethorn ~ 37-38 rare (I think it was)
---
Broken Tooth - Badlands ~ 36-37 rare.
---
By what I remember from the olden days Sin'Dall was the best looking model of the group... But it has been a LONG time since I played Vanilla or run through Stranglethorn.
---
nah shift and ctrl are modifiers for my clicks
---
You're probably better off opening with an immolate as you send in your voidwalker, followed by COA/corruption. Immolate seems to do enough upfront damage to tag the mob.
---
Thanks, downloading it now.
---
It's a cultural thing. We do it after our Football games, too, losing team gets eaten.
---
[Some people just can't take a joke, it seems](https://i.imgur.com/BWDDQf6.png)
---
Barrens is right between troll and orc starting area and is also level 10-20. Should be perfect
---
Griefing is not the responsibility of Blizzard to prevent, but they can punish you for it.
---
You can still body aggro. It doesn't help if you're lowest level member can potentially wipe the team by pulling 5 extra mobs. Since the healer is low level they won't be able to handle the extra healing demand from adds
---
Yeah that's pretty much what I had to do. Happy with it though! Nugrunner is also decent if anyone wants an aura timer that works!
---
Yeah it seems bizarre to me too. I wouldn't encourage folks to continue this weird tradition-- just to know its there so if someone puts out in the chat "LFG for VC" it's not total gibberish.

Its both, you can either use the website version or download the program.
---
Shifting between forms is tedious without macros, being able to go from cat to bear and back again is a pretty big difference compared to unshifting, and casting. Even if you’re super efficient with it the macro will already be faster.
---
/cancelform
---
/cast bear form
---
Since you can’t use the stance bar to switch between them (have to drop form first) this simple macro will save time in many situations. Not saying you’re playing wrong, but this will help you play better
---
As a tank, if you’re going to aoe, do not immediately open up as soon as I’ve engaged the mob or you will be tanking them. It takes a bit to build aggro and warriors have extremely limited aoe threat building early on - we pretty much have to cycle targets to attack individually. 
---
That said, don’t bother aoeing at all unless there’s 3+ mobs, it’s less efficient both damage and mana wise. If your group is killing stuff within 1-2 frostbolts, that is an excellent “problem” to have.
---
Can we see a SS of your layout? :O
---
Everybody is going to wait and see. Nobody wants to be on a dead server
---
I've honestly never seen anyone else do this. I have no idea if it's bannable, truly.
---
Mages crumble in PvP if you don't know how to kite.  Unless you're doing 3 minute mage.
---
Interesting. Mind sharing the macro?
---
Oh, yeah. I got it from artisian trainer in Undercity, gotta know now. Thank you!
---
You are right, there is no dps spec for shaman. Enhance and ele do terrible dps and don't bring anything unique 
---
I was a shaman in vanilla and was dismayed, to put it lightly, upon discovering shaman were resto only.

If you want to dps in raids and don't want to do it as a joke meme spec reroll now

First and only bad player experience with a player; I had just left Wailing Caverns with a pal that wanted some new bags, and I was ready to head back to crossroads when a hunter trying to tame a wind serpent frantically demanding we help, "help", "heals" and so on. I had been asking for where to find a specific quest enemy, and he said he'd help if we helped him get the wind serpent. After about 8 minutes of struggling with mana, elite mob pulls (outside of WC), and other bullshit we got the mob and he walks me over to one of the three spawn locations. Mad Magglish is at the last one, and I joyfully start the fight! My friend who needed bags was already out of there, but the guy who we'd helped get the wind serpent sees me start the fight and just runs the fuck out. I'm frantically asking for help, because mad magglish has stuns and is an elite mob, and my gear is mostly red and broken down.   
---
This hunter keeps on running, leaves the group and of course I die. I messaged saying that I didn't appreciate what he did, gave him a thumbs down, and ignored him. Lesson learned, don't help someone that doesn't ask nicely. They won't be nice in return.
---
My grubby hands bought them so yeah
---
We do have a great realm tbf 
---
Its actually very easy at level 10, you could both meet at the crossroads in the barrens, its not very far for either of you. If you need directions there's literally a buttload of people in this subreddit that would be more than happy to explain the journey you both need to make.
---
Yeah it is kinda normal try to predict how fast a mob is going to die and start your next frostbolt on a healthier target.  If your party is just aoeing you can just spam blizzard for easy damage.
---
I have a scarred battle boar named NielsBoar. Almost no one ever notices but the few who do always chuckle.
---
I'm thinking of switching to a lion and calling him ChairmanMeow
---
yup i get that, and hopefully my answer is what you were looking for. you still have the name of the site in your title and post, though, which just makes it easier for people to google. i'm not trying to give you shit for it because I get your concern, but it's generally frowned upon to post this sort of stuff because even if it isn't intended, it kinda works like free advertising for those scumbags.
---
Yeah, that’s definitely Rasputin
---
Thanks man! I bought it by mistake! Didn’t notice the cost haha. I think I’m going to drop skinning for enchanting? Not sure if it’s a good call but enchanting sounds more fun and I get my hands on soo many greens as tank so IDK. Skinning definitely payed for itself many time over
---
Appreciate it!! It will be SM armory spam tonight so I can finish off my scarlet set 😈
---
your bags are full and just have no space
---
Yep agreed, saves you a point you can put in spirit link or the 10% pet focus regen
---
What addon are you using to see the AH price?
---
I think you're the one who doesn't understand layering.
---
It's not a mechanic.  It's an architecture designed to deal with the fact that a simulation process can't simulate fast enough to handle 10,000 clients all with overlapping areas of interest.
---
Then you're balancing classes around raids and now PvP is out of whack.  Try to balance arenas around factions not having one or the other, I wish you luck.
---
Does it make sense for all non hunters to have this ability?
---
They have factories in China where people work to farm gold in games like WoW. It's estimated in many scholarly articles available online (some I posted in a reply earlier) that at least 80%-85% of players from china are gold farmers. Pretty shocking.
---
Death to the Scourge! And death to the living! *I guess*
---
Had this issue. Turned out to be classic codex / questie. When you have a quest that requires something common across the world (like cloth or something) the addons refreshes the map every time you enter a new area. It essentially populates the map with every mob that can drop linen cloth in the entire game.
---
I either abandoned the quest or stopped tracking it. Hope this helps.
---
The entire zone exists in Classic, you have to work your way through the elite demons in the south of Winterspring and make a couple jumps to get there since it's closed off but once you finally get inside you can follow the road all the way up!
---
Am I the only one who is noticing these rando keybinds?!?!     
---
Naga mouse? or just crazy dude?
---
Don't know if this will qualify as a question for the thread, but what's a good go-to spec for leveling Mage? I've been building up 17/31/3 for Fire but I've heard a couple people claim Frost is better. Can't say I've tried any AoE grinding but right now just focusing on questing and doing a couple dungeons with the guild along the way.
---
I save them so I can kill them myself
---
Does anyone know a working addon that shows how long I have left on the buffs I give my party and the dots I give those pesky gnomes??
---
I hate you! 
---
But sick wolf, gratz!
---
It does for melee classes, not so much for casters.
---
Except that's still stupid.  Alliance doing better in vanilla is not justification for Horde doing better in BC.
---
I did this to somone on a zep...i told them before the duel. Whats the worst that could happen?
---
Blizzard support wants to know your location.
---
Most people use Discord, but I believe there is voice chat integrated with Battle.net: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/64566
---
That's what I was thinking, but will I be losing out on a bunch of training points to level up bite, claw and growl?  Thanks for the reply.
---
*Saved*
---
I'll check it out and get back to you =)
---
I used to do that when people jumped off the waterfall for princess runs, lol.
---
Who really cares. Why are you even paying attention
---
I haven't messed with any of the deep settings, but it is funky yet functional for me. I get an error message when I login and have to set my click choices but it otherwise appears to work as intended. It's a little annoying, but i really appreciate having the added functionality of the addon, so I make do (due?)
---
This was a dungeon cleave. My point is, people say the thing they love about Classic is the social element. That’s until people realized it’s faster to level 12-60 with their friends. Then, suddenly the social element is irrelevant.
---
I'm sure evening times aren't terrible, outside of raid consideration.  1400 horde probably doesn't have enough 55+ to field more than one MC raid.
---
Class envy
---
When we expose Mankrik's true plan he's going to be... Consumed by Hatred...EEEYEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHH 😎😎😎
---
Trolls start in durotar, taurens in mulgore, they are very close to each other. You can both level to 10 separately or one of you can run to the other's starting area. Both of you will have to go to the barrens at level 10 anyway so you can just wait until then.
---
Fear not Ranger, Cavalier, Magician, Thief, aaand Acrobat Reader
---
[Replace "Nostalrius" with "Classic Wow"](https://youtu.be/pnuFvO1iHAg).  There are reasons this is a meme.
---
My priorities as a Mage in a dungeon are
---
1 keep a target sheeped. It gets broken pretty often by people in the party on accident, and I think is the most important job to prevent a wipe.
---
2 Dps, If frost spec that usually means frostbolt if only 1 or 2 targets. If someone other then the tank pulls aggro, I stay close enough to frost nova and help the tank keep aggro. If more then 2 targets usually a frost bolt or 2 to buy time for tank to gain threat, the nova for freeze, and blizzard. 
---
3 Depending on the fight counterspell can be a lifesaver. Make sure to purge curses as you see them. Keep buffs up.
---
Give me something more exciting
---
Bum bum bi dum, bum bum bum bey!
---
Nope. Perfect World does the same for Valve’s DotA2. They literally get the publishing rights and then can do anything they want. Ban professional players from circuit events to qualify to the International(dota world championship). Hold majors and the international even though people with certain passports are barred from entry. Too many issues to name.
---
Within reason, your abilities are free to others in a group. For example, a mage shouldn't charge for water for group mates. It's an expectation they provide that to the group.
---
I think the only place this doesn't apply is rare profession skills that they invested money into, like a rare recipe or enchant.
---
Y'all a bunch of fucking pussy's tbh.. what's your point
---
Then they should never buff anyone else with sanctuary.
---
LVL 27 Undead Mage.
---
Im quite sick of questing atm, ive done one run of BFD (enough to complete all the quests).
---
Are there any dungeons I can do at lvl 27 or is that too low for the next one? Kinda feeling stumped atm, is AoE grinding to 30 a good idea?
---
People are saying it's defensive / you're playing bad and pulling aggro, but that isn't why I would PWS casters before a pull.  It's simply because some pulls have mobs that do AoE damage, and this damage does knockback on cast times.  PWS the casters is a dps increase.
---
They don't get the game cards from Blizzard.
---
if you got that deduction fro mblizzard's clear wording, then i think it's safe to say the idiot is you
---
So much this. 
---
I has 4 toons in BC with T5 to T6 gear and I loved playing all of them. I didn't have to worry about doing their dailies or the rep grinds I just needed to put it the work to progress them through relevant content. I played Kara, SC/TK, and BT for most of the expansion through different lenses and felt progression on all those characters.
---
Now I can't even get all my rank 3 essences on 1 toon let alone my alts because I can't log in every day. And I'm in a 5/8 mythic guild. 
---
People like grinding when they can pick their rewards and progression path. That's what classic is all about. Don't force us to play a certain way or commit a certain amount of time.
---
I will not join a group with master loot in unless it's a guild raid.
---
&gt;Yeah I'm ok, done here.  You're a fucking retard. 
---
&gt;&gt;Blizzard has ACTIVELY REMOVED layers since launch and is continuing to do as we get closer and closer to a stable population for phase 2.
---
&gt;You have no proof of this and I have proof of the opposite.  They increased layers to help with queue times.
---
Okay so your proof is blizzard saying they've increased server capacity which in no way states they've increased the number of layers, for all you know they could've increased the number of players per layer.  
---
However somehow my proof of blizzard stating multiple times they will remove layers following the days after launch and literally them saying it's down to single digits, (keyword being DOWN as in it's DECREASED) is somehow not enough proof for you despite being more indicative then your so called "proof" that isn't evidence of more layers, just larger capacity. 
---
Yeah, I'm definitely the retard. Lmao
---
Or install Bagnon addon
---
Gank him my undeat brother
---
Why do people roll need on BoE?
---
Why do people roll on chests?
---
Why do people roll on non-needed loot?
---
Why do people not roll on Vendor Greys/White?
---
Value.
---
Don’t pick the lock, fine.
---
#But if you run up, lockpick a chest and take everything, 99% of the time you will get kicked from the party. Its called Ninja loot.
---
If you demand all locked chests be yours, fine. 99% of parties will not invite you along.
---
If you demand all mining nodes be yours, 99% of people won’t give two shits about it.
---
Why? Value.
---
Trolls and tauren starting areas are so close that after level 10, you can just meet up. And just follow a leveling zone chart to see where you should head for certain levels (I don't play Horde as much, so I don't know the leveling zones by heart.)
---
And as far as tips to level together, it depends on how much your time availability coincides. If one person is able to play a lot more than the other, then it might be a good idea to have an alt that you level when the other person is offline. This helps to keep your levels the same.
---
Or work on professions and other extracurricular things while the other person is offline.
---
Will WOW Classic eventually have the classic expansions added?
---
+shadow damage stuff, robe of the void is great pre-raid gear (tough to craft though), after ZG releases you can craft the Bloodvine set which is BiS for quite a while.
---
Op, what app you using to organise your runs?
---
Whaaaat?? You're saying Layering resulted in irrevocably crowded servers and there's no way to undo it, and now Blizzard is flailing around creating dead servers?  Who could have predicted this?????
---
1 - dungeon grinding can be pretty slow too unless you have a good group
---
2 - Enhance is definitely the way to go for leveling
---
3 - I wouldn't personally worry about lightning shield every mob.  It doesn't do enough damage for the mana it uses.  Searing totem, storm strike, and whatever shocks are doing good damage for you at the moment.  Your windfury procs will probably do most of your damage, so don't go too crazy with spells and mana.
---
I think this goes without saying, but make sure you have the best weapon you possibly can at all times, and make sure you have windfury on it.
---
Facts are: He got server first 60 on multiple private servers. No one has proof that he account shared.
---
Also, I dont know much about law and justice, but what I do know is:" Innocent until prooven guilty." So he doesnt have to proof his innocence, you have to proof that he is guilty.
---
Buffwatch for buffs, omni cc for timer
---
We’re not okay, we promise.
---
How does it get the disenchant price, are the materials from DEing each item static?
---
You can health funnel but I’m not sure it’s ever worth it
---
Where do you get good class specific wow macros?
---
ElvUI!
---
Population caps are an entirely separate issue.
---
If you have a realm population of 200 million, but no concurrency demand because no one wanted to play, layering would not be necessary.
---
If you have a realm population of 100,000 and 50% of them are trying to play at any one time, all the time, you need capacity for 50,000 concurrents or you get queueing at anything below that concurrency capacity.
---
I'm going to start playing then! Thanks!
---
I would gladly carry that random right there if only for comedic relief
---
suffer not the undead to live.
---
or. something.
---
I think people have gotten better at the game tbh. The difficulty rings true for me from my experience 15 years ago. Levelling a warrior has been a sobering experience. Two mobs in the 10-20 range and I better have a health potion. 
---
As for dungeons. I wait to dps until I see sunders. But have had several dps start immediately and take aggro from tank. 
---
Never played private servers so dunno what the norm is there.
---
Don't.
---
I already decided off playing priest based on the 'DoT &amp; wand' lvling and the 'shadow lol' endgame.
---
Don't make me reconsider my hard choices.
---
One is a job, the other isn't
---
I love being in daniel
---
There's a reason they have to join pugs even though they're a tank.
---
So true, so true
---
Thats Horde ground they’re digging. They were asking for it.
---
Once BWL comes out it changes things quite a bit. By the time BWL came out in Vanilla, everyone knew their classes well and had great gear, it was just a harder dungeon. If I were you I would really look forward to BWL, because if you didn't go through that the first time you're in for a treat. I still consider it the best dungeon in WoW history.
---
I think he got it on shutterfly.
---
Perfect! Can't wait to start playing.
---
Went from 35 to 80g last night farming these on my rogue. Bought an azure silk belt and some underwater pots to help me out. Definitely worth it if you have these items but if not you might as well just farm badlands/stv
---
Yes, until you start talking about raid environments and some upper level dungeons. I'm leveling one now (only at 40), and with a pure enhancement build I've been able to tank, dps, and heal all dungeons I've come across. Lmk if you want some advice
---
I wasn't paying any attention to the release date. It dropped on the 2nd day of my weeks vacation... I lost almost the whole vacation to it.
---
Then why wouldn’t you need instead, to prevent the possibility of ninjaing.
---
You should have Health Funnel available.. I also believe you can bandage your voidwalker via first aid, someone may need to confirm that.
---
Something something fear ward.
---
Hmm I am a tailoring mage with 150 so i could start selling bags, but where do i aoe farm? And can i still do it as a fire mage?
---
As long as you are being attacked in the face by melee attacks, this is mostly true. So maybe good while leveling. 
---
I think the reduction in swing time is 40%.
---
when are therse posts going to stoooooooop
---
No dude I just smash my face on my keyboard when I play
---
I am quite sure it always applies, but getting spell power before higher levels is rare enough to almost guarantee you wont even notice.
---
Ha, first thing that popped in my mind too
---
The economy is completely fucked on windseeker right now.
---
Yea im aware. Used to have a bunch of marcros set up for it back-when. It was more a ? on what that said in particular :)
---
/world is half helpful and half cancerous. So good tip.
---
The designers put so much effort into little things like this. It's amazing
---
I've been feeling similarly. I quit mid cata, and came back for about a month in WoD. To me at that point, the game just felt bloated. Each expansion had to add in some gimmick to gameplay- some were better than others, and over time it made the game feel really disjointed as you went from areas belonging to different expansions.
---
Classic is clunky as hell in some aspects, and I am definitely missing some quality of life things (I know it's a hot button issue, but I'd love the option to use the retail graphics,  and dual spec would be amazing), but the world feels whole and connected again like it hasn't felt in a really long time.
---
I was actually successful in getting three immediate revenges today in STV! One was against a Warrior 5 levels higher than me. Anyone else have any success?
---
a cat with prowl is the best for this :D
---
For a pretty penny one can change to any servers as far as I can remember. Meaning Monday makes rules go away;) poff!!;)
---
More like Illidaddy issues
---
Yay! :) Hope you have a fantastic time back in Azeroth!

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

For horde mages and priests, save all the light feathers you get while questing in the barrens (Not sure if alliance gets a ton of light feather drops). These are used as a reagent for Slow fall and levitation respectively which are both extremely useful to have on your action bar.
---
A guy was doing this in SM and sending everyone into graveyard over and over for a good 30min lol.
---
Ok? Why reply to it
---
Just cause its classic doesnt mean you have to play on a monitor from 2004 lol
---
I say this with a heavy heart... you my friend just got yeeted into the shadow realm
---
You're completely right, pve server all the way.
---
These people are chumps, go Arms with Anger Management, Stance Dance like crazy with a 2 hander, you'll top charts and ALWAYS maintain aggro
---
Only certain bosses do you want to flip to the shield, and keep yourself a macro to swap so you can use defensives / Shield Bash
---
Warrior has a massive skill ceiling with Stance Dancing and weapon swaps, don't limit yourself bud! Go all out!
---
Yeah, you get parry haste and the next auto is accelerated. Since 90% of shaman levelling is auto-attacking while mana regens anything that helps with that is great.
---
Though unfortunately it's still not worth using windfury, rockbiter is higher and more consistent dps.
---
Overhealing for \*hots\* is what he said, not overhealing in general.
---
I appreciate it! Thanks Brodie
---
I think you won bro
---
ah you mean herb leeway.
---
Yeah I am definitely excited for BWL.
---
Yes, but they were also kinda unwieldy to balance and you had tons of points in the end. 
---
In Vanilla it works, because you have one 31 talent or another 21 talent to choose. 
---
In BC you could do both, with each expansion it was harder for them to balance around them.
---
That does make sense to me.  I have been petrified at the thought of playing a PVP server because I know for a fact I will never win in a fight.  I just simply am not the right caliber of player to effectively work through it quick enough to counter any attack.  I'd just be ganked, and then comes the guy who is "bored" and decides to camp my corpse over and over.  No thanks.
---
Warrior has a fluid gameplay style even at low levels where it seems like you’re eating after every pull. Early on, if you have no rage, you’re just smacking mobs with a pointy stick. Work On your rage management now (it will help you be an even better warrior at max level). Finish each fight with excess rage (if you can). Heal quick, charge right back into battle while your shout is still up and your rage bar is still red. Get comfortable doing this. 
---
Warriors do not stop. Rage is your life easy on. Rage is attacks. Attacks are dead mobs. Dead mobs don’t damage you. Become the river. Flow with your rage. Allow the rage to flow through you. Become the rage. You are rage.
---
I'm going to start, I've decided. Pve servers shouldn't be bad at all!
---
\^-- this
---
I mean, they aren't wrong.  FFA is FFA.  By having that on, you did not set up guidelines as to what should and shouldn't be FFA.  You can't take stuff FFA, and then, because a good item drops and you don't get it, suddenly it's not FFA anymore.
---
I most certainly think a paid transfer would let you join a full server yes
---
T H E G R E A T E R G O O D
---
Forsaken are just dead humans... enough said.
---
It's bound to the button left of Z :) At least for me.
---
You’ll find that most casual players disagree and think that not everyone should need on boe epics, but most experienced players understand that the gold generated from the item is equally valuable to everyone.
---
The idea has been tossed around, but there hasn't been any official word one way or another.
---
&gt;I think people have gotten better at the game tbh
---
They have, which is why I think making the game a little harder by making the mobs harder to kill, would make the game better.
---
Honestly, I think retail ended up with too many quality of life improvements (and the design definitely focused on a more curated experience as well).
---
Also, mounts (especially flying) speed up travel and suddenly you have point A and point B and no longer have a journey.
---
Thanks.
---
Has anyone who has actually been to Silithus seen exactly what state it is in? Is it the completely dead zone it was at Vanilla launch? The version with the revamped mobs/zone with only a few quests from pre-1.8? Or the post-1.8, but pre-war effort version?
---
Told my parents itll be a solid 2 months without seeing me.
---
They're a 10min drive from me.
---
They don’t like being called out and want to blame you for reacting badly to their shitty behavior.
---
Because party leader said I couldn't on BoE's lol didn't want to get kicked from the party or blacklisted
---
Here I am trying to get ready for a Stockades *and* Gnomeregan run this weekend -- if time permits, and i find a group (aka get lucky) -- and i'm seeing loot drops from Scholo/Strat/BRD.
---
Congrats, but my got I'm behind the leveling curve. Mortage/kids/career sucks!
---
Also, tailors will happily turn your cloth into bags just for the skill points. If you're going to vendor them, the bag vendors for more than the bandage equivalent.

You should feel abandoned by those who made you feel that it was ok to use that program.

At least Blizzard did what they said they would do.
---
Haha me2 playing daoc as a kid got me used weird binds.
---
LOVER OF THE RUSSIAN QUEEN!
---
My issue with lots of Isekai is the trend to be either Harem anime or even worse Lolicon which let's not kid ourselves is straight up idealizing childporn. 
---
If they would just drop at least the Loli bullshit I could enjoy more of them.
---
Apart from Vanilla and TBC, I was always in a rush, wanted gear and mounts etc and I ruined the game for myself.
---
Classic came and I decided I’m gonna level all my professions as I go, do a little AH flipping, help people out just because. I’m in a position where I can’t play as much as I want to and I’m loving the time I can.
---
Maybe it’s not the game, maybe it’s how you’re playing it? And if you haven’t yet, get a healthy friends list and a cool guild. Or, just stop, only a game after all.
---
Haha ty

How is this bow proc effect I heard people use it to kite stuff in certain raid
---
There was an annoying rogue on the zeppelin from .org to undercity yesterday that kept spam dueling me. I finally accepted and proceeded to psychic scream him to the edge of the zeppelin where he panicked and fell off dying to fall damage right before we zoned into tirisfal glades. Highlight of my day.
---
I’m sure I read the transfer is to a single new realm, I could be wrong.
---
People want to be shouted out and get recognition. It's really selfish. It's like the people who give a great birthday gift and can't wait to have the person open it so the group can see who it came from. Imagine the only way to give gold to a steamer is by anonymous mail; no one would do it, because there would be no way to prove you did it and get recognition.
---
These people who donate gold to streamers are also fundamentally changing the gaming experience for everyone.
---
Removing the skill trees was BS. Also gutting the classes 
---
/homeogenization just annoyed me too. I only had access to healing spells as a balance druid if I specced into it when druids shouldn't have to do that. Priests not having access to normal healing spells if they're shadow. The dispels for poison/curses etc got put on an unnecessary cool downs. Battle rezes being raid/group wide, etc. That took all the uniqueness out of the classes, at least for me they did.
---
To be fair, not *quite* like this.
---
In a group with a target an all weakauras visible [image.png](https://postimg.cc/xcVH3FfN)

Absolutely, the "Funnel Health" ability will do this.
---
What addon lets you do different tabs for different chats?
---
What’s wrong with people being excited?
---
For warrior it is night and day gear depending. It’s disturbing but it’s only temporary so I am ok with it:)
---
I almost did as well! Definitely easy to do. I say do what sounds most fun to you! I might drop herbalism for leather working so I can eventually craft the black dragonscale stuff.
---
Nice! Good luck on your drops! That set looks so good.
---
I like to watch a stream of a game while I play because it feels like I’m playing alongside them. I definitely agree with you. It’s good entertainment and is a nice break from music while you’re grinding.
---
So 99% of the time you are being a greedy, petty person who is calling someone else a greedy, petty person. It's okay when you do it, not when someone else does it. If someone else does it they should get kicked and never be allowed to party with anyone ever again. But when you are being greedy over something that you 99% of the time don't have access to, it's fine.
---
&gt; 99% Of The Time You Will Get Kicked From The Party. Its Called Ninja Loot.
---
This thread, look in the comments, it doesn't seem like the majority of players agree on whether or not the rogue is obligated to open, or roll on the chest. So you can take your bullshit else where.
---
Idk I'm making my own
---
Do we know exactly what state it is in? Is it the completely dead zone it was at Vanilla launch? The version with the revamped mobs/zone with only a few quests from pre-1.8? Or the post-1.8, but pre-war effort version?
---
Man I loved BWL. The first downing of Nefarian was amazing. (Probably best mechanic in a fight as well).
---
You will need to target the character.  Left clicking them would be the easiest.  Then activate the item like you normally would.
---
If you have an enemy or nothing selected it targets self.
---
Strawman
---
I used classic.wowhead as my source, and this is just a rough diagram if zone ordering
---
It would be very stupid to equip it therefore all can roll on it
---
No, that's the point of need/greed. If it's an upgrade, need it, unless it was previously agreed upon that a specific person (e.g. the guild's raid tank) would get an item if it drops.
---
I am of the "Red=Dead" mentality when I see the opposing faction.
---
The only exception is for fellow anglers. Even if they're fishing a pool I want, the fishermen's code prevails, they were there first.
---
(This coming from growing up in a fishing family/community)
---
I don’t think you understand why they banned you.
---
I didn't think anyone else here raved! haha  
---
Sick totem man, won't be at Lost Lands, but bring that bad boy to EDC and I'll see you there in May &lt;3
---
So you’re going to act like you’re knowledgeable but then ask how other classes that can tank are going to stop themselves from getting one hit in dungeons? Ok buddy sounds good 👍
---
Lol good one!
---
The answer is, all. All the time i have.
---
You are misrepresenting what I said. I am only talking about BoE epics. Most people are lucky if they ever even see one of these let alone win one. You would be stupid to equip something like Staff of Jordan instead of selling it.
---
Go summon your own mage food.
---
Go heal yourself.
---
Go buff yourself.
---
and most of all, go fuck yourself you selfish asshat.
---
On the right, you can see a Dwarf Rogue trying to hide behind it...
---
You sound like the asshole here. Enjoy your ban.
---
wellp....\*\*Aggressively rerolls as a priest\*\*

Can I tank (warrior) Deadmines at level 18?
---
What's the chat add-on to color it
---
RIP
---
The oldest joke in the last few days. You are NOT original.
---
Yeah some rando discord isn't going to cut it. Not going to argue with you anymore because you're an idiot. While slam resets swing timer it deals weapon damage to the mob. I've been leveling without having to eat or bandage by hamstring kiting and using slam after white hit when I reconnected the mob. Your strat makes you sit there taking a ton of damage and you obviously lose seconds eating or bandaging after about 50% of your fights. But feel free to correct me by uploading a YouTube vid of your taking mobs down that are within a level of you without having downtime before 4 of them. I'll be waiting and I'm sure your strat can't support the consistency of moving from mob to mob without much downtime. And dungeons don't count as you aren't taking damage the tank is.
---
Thank you
---
Can someone fill me in on this reference please?
---
I'm not saying he didn't do it. If you read my comments you'd understand that.
---
What I'm saying is, people shouldn't be celebrating him as the first to do it when there's absolutely no evidence he did it himself.
---
He's been made a Twitch Partner. That's going to make him a lot of money. This should be investigated further as potential fraud.
---
Hot Fuzz, part of the Cornetto trilogy
---
No you just realistically probably didnt have anything to complain about, but you wanted to.

Nah, hes counted as my minion so they cant do anything mean to him when MC'd. Only me!

You will need to raid as resto.
---
Get the t1 that has spell damage (it's mostly healing), then fill in the other pieces with blues.
---
For the rings, trinkets, neck and weapons you will need to wait for the mages and locks to pass then start rolling against the many many other shaman with the same goal.
---
It takes awhile.
---
What Addams do you use?
---
Night elf for the simple reason of shadowmeld at horde's Felwood camp. Wait there for people to land on the flight path. Mind control them off the cliff. So so fun.
---
I haven't been eaten yet, I'm surprised!
---
Any group im in charge of is all needing on epics. It's great that you're going to use it and not sell it, but I don't trust a random to not sell it. Let the downvotes flow.
---
Generally, if it's an upgrade for you, it's safe to roll Need on it. Exceptions are for gear that's a much bigger upgrade for someone else (e.g. melee weapons if you're a hunter, +healing gear if you're not a healer even if it has other useful stats for you, etc.).
---
I declined to group with someone cause I was literally only killing one mob. Then they sling slurs and insults at me. 
---
I ignored and reported and went on with my day. Easy to deal with and move on. Just dumb. Some people are toxic. I hate it too.
---
Correction, no beta male adult whom is married uses the term whipped.
---
Just give your wife a heads up, book some time off work if u want and just play the game. Theres a difference between being a slave and being married. If you can't do something you enjoy your a slave and your relationship is unhealthy.
---
I also have now gotten greater magic essence from 21-25 weapons, so I don't even know how Astral Essence is supposed to be obtained anymore.
---
You're confusing me with someone else. I was talking about gold farmers and China.
---
Aint bad if you are a warrior/mage/shaman/healer/tank you mean lol.
---
Network Admin.....who doesn't know how to screenshot....
---
Honestly, I feel rage management is one of the biggest killers of warriors, especially early on. They are very gear dependent, so to compensate, you’ve got to play every moment looking for the advantage (until you get a nice weapon, then you just wreck things). Familiarize yourself with the rage decay rage. Pay attention to how much rage you need to charge in, apply your buffs and debuffs, and get off attacks. Pay attention to how much time this takes. With some lucky crits and rage management, you can go from mob to mob with burst attacks and HS crits
---
That's what I just said.
---
I asked that because I already know the answer. Are you new?
---
We all know pallys can’t mitigate crushing blows and they can’t taunt. That is why they cannot tank.
---
Fuck. I greeded a huge 1h upgrade because the while group (including the guildie) in the group said to greed it.
---
I've seen a macro mentioned where a warlock's pet stops attacking when they drain soul but I can't find the script. Came someone provide, along with any other useful macros. 
---
Also, are there any must have add ons for the warlock class?
---
Maybe I don't speak any English? lol.
---
Now store it and sell it when the servers have more Gold 😂
---
Or just use a bag addon that opens a single window for all bags.
---
Who's sodapoppin?
---
Are you in Dun Morogh?  Go north on the road out of Kharanos and up the hill to the big building built into the mountain.  That's Ironforge.  The quest text should sort of tell you.
---
Are you in the human area, Ellwyn Forest?  Go to Stormwind and take the tram located in the Dwarven District.
---
As for getting around faster, there are flight paths in most zones (generally located at towns/settlements) that can taxi you to and from those specific points, and at Level 40 you can get a mount that will incrase your run speed quite a bit, but until then, just get to walkin'.
---
Alliance calling horde a bunch of 12 yr olds is my fav part of this. My least fav is the rest of it equally. Came out last week toolbox. Calm ur moobs.
---
Yes and they are very easy to make. I still always roll greed on chests though.
---
Exactly! I'd rather not be a dirt, pig farmer living in the desert
---
Again, the only person who was confused here was you. 
---
Helpful hint for the current:
---
I couldn’t really care any less that a bunch of neets on Reddit who don’t understand that they’re products of a dying era (and as someone who enjoys mmos I’m also apart of that era, I just understand that it *is dying*) are downvoting me. If they’re not willing to read an entire conversation and pick up inference (I mean thinking that ‘gaming is dying that’s why fortnite makes hundreds of millions a month is an actual case for why gaming is dying opens up a whole different can of worms for comprehension issues).
---
&gt;I'm lucky in that I'm a Shaman and we have an easy interrupt so I stare those priests in the god damn eye and dare a motherfucker to try and get that cast off.
---
Retail
---
&gt;Then of course they resist it and I go flying off the boat anyway.
---
Classic
---
I’m almost 40. I quested to get the quests for dungeons if I didn’t have my group. When I have my group I burn instances and elite quests.  
---
I’m leveling Hybrid Prot Warrior. I don’t solo quest well but when my crew with a dwarf priest get together we smash dungeons pretty hard.
---
... waiting in queue must have got you all paranoid
---
I think that I have far less downtime between mobs which who cares how much dps you do if you have to spend 10+ seconds to heal before each other fight when I have only the seconds it takes me getting to the next mob since you face tank all the damage.
---
Stop spreading speculation as fact. No one knows what will end up happening.
---
I used classic.wowhead.com as my source and also this is intended just to be a rough order of the zones.
---
Right? Like I'd get it if you're messing around with some people you know. But we had a Warrior roll need on Odo's Ley Staff, when there was one person that was interested in it.  
---
Then another person rolled need on the +8 str +3 stam ring, and a rogue needed it from under two other classes.
---
I only plan on playing shadow priest in PvP. I know only the most elite and high end Spriest will be taken for raids anyway
---
&gt; Doing so automatically abandons the associated quest.
---
you sure that part was implemented in classic ?
---
if i recall its a somewhat newish feature
---
HOOOOOOOOYEAH!
---
I had run out of steam to play WoW since midway through cataclysm. But when I did play during MoP I absolutely fucking *loved* the atmosphere. The damn place was pretty, many of the jade forest parts were actually entertaining to me, and exploring somewhere so totally different form the rest of the world was great.
---
But once I hit cap i jumped on an alt. I got two characters to cap before I ran out of steam again. But I do not blame MoP for my lack of enjoyment. By that time I was pretty much done with WoW.
---
Look up iceHUD. Pretty easy to config but super customizable. Might be up your alley.
---
Personally, I always focus on gathering professions as I level - usually herbalism and skinning. (Herbalism because there seem to be fewer herbalists than miners, and skinning because there are *so* many mobs you can skin on the journey.) I forgo crafting professions until I get near 58, and I use the money from my gathering professions to finance that endeavor. Currently, I'm leveling a rogue and a druid. As soon as I get both to 58, I'll switch skinning to engineering. Engineering is insanely helpful in PvP, and there are some excellent PvE uses (Goblin Jumper Cables XL). As for fishing and cooking - I save that until I'm really bored on a non-raid or slow PvP day. There are some huge benefits to cooking, and your guildmates will love you.

How are you liking shadow form? Does it show a significant increase in DPS?
---
Can you flip in and out of it to heal people?
---
Silence into MC. Try me.
---
WoW has a long history of being classified as a serious addiction in the media. With the stories of kids playing until they die from sleep deprivation etc. So the MSM sees it as a negative thing if they arn't active participants.
---
I got my wife to play retail about a year ago with me
---
I was power leveling her and this dropped for her.
---
Guild chat explodes with "Grats!"
---
She didn't even know what it was or used for or anything.
---
She stopped playing about a week later.
---
From what I read, priests should not shield tanks who build resources from taking damage, which makes sense.
---
So, bubbles are for damage dealers.
---
You don't need questie if you're just doing dungeons.
---
My wife plays. Problem solved.
---
It's in Classic, no idea when it was implemented
---
I heard BR are staying...
---
Can confirm :'(
---
How did the spongebob guys think of this jesus
---
My favorite thing was to roll a tank and have my friend roll a healer. We would get people in there and then break it to them that it was gonna be a full clear. Depending on how they responded they might get added to friends lists. 
---
BRD was always a lot of fun to troll people with. The other good one was Gnomeragan. My least favorite was always Sunken Temple because people get so lost there, but I hated it even more after they shrunk it in Cata.
---
How much did this cost, and where can I buy this?
---
&gt;You're correct, but it seems a lot of people do not feel this way.
---
The downvotes reflect this lol. Being right on Reddit ain't always easy.
---
There's also a game theoretical element. If I was the tank, I'd frankly be more inclined to just say I actually do need the shield and equip it, rather than roll the dice (literally) with a 1/5 chance of a large payout.
---
Lost Lands is the only festival we can afford this year unfortunately. But were going all out to make up for it lol
---
Jumper cables FTW
---
As someone who has tanked Deadmines and Gnomeregan as a Priest, I can tell you, things will be fine, don't treat low-level instances like they were end-game raid. Maybe you prefer to practice doing things the "right" way and there's nothing wrong with that, but in the end, unless someone is constantly making your group wipe, or making everyone's job much harder, there's no reason for you to ask them to comply to your standards, which may be excessive, relative to the difficulty level of the content in instances.
---
wtf was this cringe japanese porn music?
---
PVP in MoP did mostly feel pretty alright.
---
Except warlocks. I was unable to hate anything more than I did Warlocks in MoP.
---
Spend five minutes learning the dungeon before hand. Wailing Caverns is not a slow clear if you know where you're going.
---
When should you sacrifice some spirit for intellect? I know intellect isn’t really a priority stat for priests, especially while leveling, but I feel kinda weird turning down a piece of gear that has, for instance, +5 int but -1 spirit. Is there any kind of rule of thumb here? Also I assume +healing power is kinda useless while leveling even if I’m healing some dungeons?
---
Thanks everyone! Sounds like I'll have to settle for the wolf in the meanwhile!
---
Thanks for your input.
---
Heated disagreements over which types of magic are superior:  Probably the most gnome mage thing I can imagine.
---
Yikes, whatever helps you sleep at night

You're probably right.
---
Its called Multi Boxing
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/11704
---
Blizzard is fine with multiboxing, so no it's not cheating
---
On top of this be aware of the 5 second rule. That is your mana regen does not start until 5 seconds after your last ability that you used which cost mana. In other words, it's best to heal and damage in bursts to utilize the spirit regen. Mana per 5 stat is different and continues regardless of 5 second rule.
---
If you’ve ever called customer support expecting them to know more than you do, you’ve clearly never worked in customer support.
---
Thank you so much that helped me out drastically!
---
That works too.
---
Multiboxing. Multiple accounts with software to have them all respond to one button press. Totally legal. Has been common throughout the life of the game.
---
Cats don't they leave an ungodly amount of hair on your mouse pad. I can never keep my clean dude.
---
This is really a smart phone generation thing. Most people can't go 5 minutes anymore without being engaged in something. I'm no doctor, but I can't imagine that is a good thing.

I remember that happening in the past. Do you have addons?

It's called Multiboxing and it's been a part of WoW since forever.

Guards in Major cities will tell you where everything is if you ask em :)

Handynotes and the different plug-ins for it, it's really the best!
---
You expect the same people who peddle the “Violence in Video Games = Violence in Real Life” narrative to understand that?
---
IMO the rush personally, is that being stuck below 40 sucks as a warrior and sucks for a lot of classes that aren't mage.
---
The secondary reason is you dont want to be below 60 during phase 2, of you're on a pvp server you're no longer a human being... your just honor points for the opposite faction, so being 60 and having decent gear to stand a chance in bgs and wpvp is a good goal to have imo.

I’m sorry that’s the incorrect question. Minus 50 dkp

The kids dieing are rare cases, but the game is built to be highly addictive.

yeah, 18 is the common minimum for deadmines
---
I'm saying the reason people think that way is because of the looking for group tool in retail. People downloading me or to fucking stupid to realize I wasn't talking about classic.

😭 😭 😭 
---
This is where men cried
---
You started with a point.   Just for the future you shouldn't belittle someone and brag about your /played because it makes you seem like an asshole.

Layering has nothing to do with overall population.
---
If you're a mage just do some farm runs. Get like fully geared super quick
---
I believe my dad ordered it from Shutterfly, however I'm sure he provided the high res scan of the map from the WoW box. If you can get that map in high res I'm sure you could order one.
---
Just 1 guy killing off newbs. Nice clickbait
---
You probably can't. If you kill 4 mobs/min (pretty high amount) it still takes you 3 minutes to get enough XP to handle a quest turnin.
---
If quests are out of your way, you don't do them.
---
Can confirm. Ran SM Cath a couple days ago with a 36 Feral Tank. Went surprisingly fine, especially with his level

Dun-Morogh 30.9, 32.6

Post a vid of your leveling on YouTube to prove that you are able to generate procs and added dps as efficient as it is simmed and have no downtime until the 4th mob you fight. If you can apply 3x sunder and hamstring kite as well as you say it shouldn't be hard.
---
Yeah I used to buff people that way back in the day.

Yeh, needs at least another 18 feet.

Your complaint is that your class can do everything and so it’s hard to keep track of everything. Sounds like a good problem to have.

Now you have to do something this nice for someone else and keep spreading the chain of kindness.

Multiboxing is fine. 
---
However if hes casting synchronized, it means that hes using some sort of third party took to mimic the key bind on his other characters.  Like pushing 3 on the main account automatically hits 3 on the subsequent accounts.   I believe that's not okay.   Blizz has a ruling someone that its 1 key push per ability. He would need to physically be pushing 3 on each character for it to be okay.
---
I do agree, it was cool and felt a bit more ”epic” I suppose, but it was extremely hard to get your gear.

Rofl, I always try to do risky charges like this when I see a chance. I've seen some funny videos of weird charges recently.

I would always recommend fishing and cooking as a pure utility. How else are you going to restore health between pulls?

If you want gold, I recommend playing in the AH. I don't think professions will get you gold unless you get herbalism and/or mining.
---
so wait can you mind control any player? Or do they have to be like a lower level or?
---
botting it was a known problem in classic as well
---
Blizzard allows it because each of those characters is a $15 subscription fee.

I guess I'm the opposite. Back then I had no ambition and didn't know what I was gonna do with my life. Now I feel "whole". Career, hobbies, relationships all feel strong and complete. Why not fuck it all up with a little WoW?

Is there a warrior subreddit? I can't find consisted good information. Talent tree/buying abilities from trainers/rotations etc. Would appreciate the help.
---
If they're offering a transfer, don't be an idiot and just take it.
---
The only reason they even offered them is because they are SO full that the sever cannot possibly sustain the population after layering is disabled. 
---
Besides, taking the transfer will allow you to play on a sever without a queue, and over time more players will roll there as it is a lower pop server.
---
One misconception people have is that a full server is better than a low pop one and this is far from the truth. Vanilla WoW simply was not intended to be played on a server with more than 5-8k other people and currently the full servers host something like 20k+
---
Awesome. Make me think of what happened to myself yesterday. Im level 16 now. I grinded  a few levels yesterday and got some lvl 10 or so greens. Nothing special. Was going to vendor them when I saw a level 11 Pally who was rocking all whites. I opened a trade window and put in some Mail bracers and legs with some strength and stam on them. I clicked Trade. 
---
The Pally just stood there and didn't accept. A few seconds later she said "???".
---
I replied, "Take these, they're upgrades for you."
---
We waited there, the trade window still green on my side for maybe 15 seconds. She responded "Why?"
---
I laughed and said, "I dont need them and they're free! Take them". Another 10 seconds goes by and the trade finally goes through.
---
"Uhh thanks" the Pally says, as if she was baffled as to why someone would give them free gear. 
---
People aren't used to this graciousness we're all experiencing. It's great. I could have gotten a sweet 7silver for those greens at vendor, but I confused a Pally, laughed about it and hopefully, if they equipped the gear, made their leveling experience a little better. It's been a fun time so far.
---
Not Tauren!
---
i donno, I had her out at lvl 28 yesterday and seduce + fear let me win a 2v1 fight against a hunter and priest who tried to kill me.
---
Do it at 52 then. Should be the same.
---
Also no sheep on a mage duel
---
this is crazy, i was a raiding member of Strange Brew in cata. I got /gkick because I stepped away to go to the bathroom and my friend took my mic and said horrible shit on vent. I'll never forgive him, good guild though.
---
That is what im doing. Ele/resto with ns is very good in pvp anyway. You don't have the mele aspect but you have more survivability. Also, look up orcbit on youtube. He has made a good pre-raid phase 1 list.
---
Thanks good to know
---
The profit obviously.
---
Inventory is full
---
Queue times are directly related to concurrency caps and layering has a direct effect on concurrency caps.  Full stop.
---
If max layer concurrency cap is n, and there are m layers, you have a concurrency cap of m x n.  Without layers, you have a concurrency cap of, effectively, one layer, or n.  Once you go above n, you queue.  Whereas, with layers you don't have queues until you have reached m x n concurrents.

My experience of this was picking up some crappy 2 handed BOE sword with +9 defence. I didn’t see much value in it but tried to hawk it for a gold, some sucker bit and asked me to COD it to him. 
---
Except I sent him the sword and one gold. I messaged him explaining this, he said he’d return it. I noticed he was infact a rogue, who would likely only sell said item and thus be overjoyed to make an early winfall.
---
Two hours passed and I had written it off, but whilst in Gnomer I noticed I had mail from said dude. Off to the clear zone I rushed, 2 gold I received. What a day.
---
I too once had 2g. Then I trained my class skill and professions. Now I have 18s.
---
Yeah crushing blows and threat are the two reasons only warriors rank. In 5 mans it's not really an issue
---
You can’t ask a question and then not reply to the direct question you asked. 
---
I know how servers work. I lived it before and I’m living it now. When I say I didn’t sign up for unbalanced servers, no one signs up for that and they hope the servers will be relatively balanced. Maybe saying “signed up” is the wrong phrasing, “hoping” the servers are balanced is a better phrasing. 
---
You asked why someone would abuse layering, I gave you the answer. Just because I know I will be outnumbered doesn’t mean I want my quest to take 30 min longer than it should when I can easily layer hop and get in a better situation. If the PvP is fun and engaging I’m all for it, but if anyone tells you it’s fun to be ganked over and over they’re full of shit. 
---
The horde racials, memories of the past, and tolling the right faction is completely irrelevant to the question you asked.
---

I am not making a youtube video for a rude scrub who refuses to listen to theory craft and think critically.  Your arguments for slam "80% dps increase" is a joke and clearly has little thought involved. No discussion of rage mechanics. Assuming I face tank mobs for some reason.

It is mechanically better than most pets. It has 1.3 as

YOU THI
---
(spell base cast time)/3.5 = coefficient
---
Heal gets 85% of your +healing
---
Flash heal gets about half that
---
Renew gets all of it *over it's full duration*. Pw:s gets like 10% of your +healing.
---
Lesser heal gets a penalty to it's coefficient, like all sub-level-20 healing spells, so it's never worth using when you get your real spells.
---
If you randomly end up with a lot of gear with +healing, by some miracle, you can calculate if it's worth. But as a general rule, it's your very best stat when you start accumulating some at 60, but nothing to actively gear for before then.
---
Some people are just confused and think stuff that applies at level cap is true while leveling, goes for any class I guess.

---
Mouse over macros. Healbot is great until they push an update that breaks it leaving you temporarily unable to play the game. I no longer rely on it.
---
Typically, crafting skills like blacksmithing and leatherworking are less valuable while leveling, because you will get better gear as quest rewards anyway.
---
The issue with warriors is that even without dying a lot, you are going to have high repair costs to your armor, more so than leather or cloth wearers. I recommend taking skinning (for beasts, as you'll be killing mobs anyway, and can sell them at the AH, though even vendors will give you a decent price for them) and tailoring (to save you expenses by being able to craft your own bags) to get you through to the endgame, then you can power-level mining and blacksmithing to craft endgame armor when gold for buying skills and mounts isn't as much of a factor.

I don't think so, if you've done any competitive gaming, your goal is always to reduce variance (random chance) because strategy and fundamentals make up for the rest - but you don't want to be at the total mercy of Random Number Generators.

Think you just answered your own question pal
---
&gt;  Is there any spot in a raid for ret?  
---
If you or a friend is leading it then its still a 10% chance. Ret in PVE is dead imo, warriors are much better and provided better dps then rets ever can. I went Paladin because I was planning on healing but leveling a pally without dungeons is painful.
---
I have seen a lot of people falling back on DKP and it disgusts me.  DKP is so bad because the people that show up all the time can just buy gear for off-spec when someone newer really needs it for main spec.
---
Idk if I was just good or lucky, I already had 5g before lvl 20. I've made over 300g and I just hit 50 yesterday. Granted I've spent a lot on mats, skills and spells. Not in a rush to get 1000g though.
---
Just make sure to get conc and imp righteous fury. Use retribution aura, devo is nice but threat from getting hit is the bread and butter of prot pally.
---
Try to make sure your DPS recognize that you need time to build up threat but once you have it, it is hard to lose.
---
&gt; You might know this, but I didn't until I was level 18: You have Talent Points. They do not need to be hoarded. Spend them. Saving them up does not help anything.

it's instant at 14 (and nearly instant at 12-13), since your first 5 points should always be going into that. So even if you don't wanna stop, 99% of the leveling process you will be able to do it.
---
You need intellect, spirit, and drinks. It's always nice to have a healer a bit higher level than minimum. You're expected to keep the tank alive. If everyone is receiving a crapload of damage and dying, your tank is failing. Not you.
---
Are you trying to say the media may be skewing data to fit a narrative?
---
Not just the dps, but the utility? Obviously ret doesnt do as much but the buffs and stuff so count towards dps right?
---
Thankfully this has been an outliner. I’ve had a couple silent groups, a few who dodge out when they are done, but even with them they’ll make sure they don’t leave mid pull - and top off buffs. 
---
I always try to poke around until the end of a quest, or at least poke around as long as I can before having to head back. In this specific scenario, we were gathering fish from Merlocs, needed 10, and he bailed when I was at 8 (not that he asked though).
---
Soon enough, another two people showed up and I partied with them and quickly finished up my quest. I stayed around until they were both half way done and got the hang of things before bouncing out since by then it was already an hour and a half of killing these damn murlocs. Much nicer group, actually had a good chat.
---
There are a ton of classic guides centered around what class is relevant and good. At the end of the day, there are 40 spots for raid, ret is 'one of' the worst classes to bring, but they do have niche uses. As a paladin you will most likely end up healing even if you're specced into ret, but get the nightfall axe and tell your raid leader you'll keep it up and you can probably get a spot in the raid no problem.
---
I don't see it.
---
Except they're all playing Orcs if they're PvPing
---
Don't roll on a PvP server if you don't want to get ganked. I really don't understand how PvP is by far the most popular realm type, yet servers are full of little b\*tches complaining about getting ganked.

---
Base casting speed
---
I disagree with asd_213 on a few things.
---
Definitely put your first three points into elemental precision.  This is a free 6% spell hit and absolutely invaluable when taking down mobs +1-3 lvls above you (prob best to avoid anything higher than +3)
---
I'd advise single target spec.  2/5 imp frostbolt (the extra .3ms reduction just isn't worth the three talent points here .. really mostly useful for reducing level 1 frostbolt for wPvP).  Also you really only need one point in permafrost for now.  Cutting these corners helps get your frostbite/shatter combo going. 
---
Learn level 1 of all your spells and try them out.  It's good to understand what they do, but agreed that you shouldn't spend $ on upgrading spells you won't use.
---
You don't need to expect it being hard to kill things until 30.  Frost mage had a very easy time killing solo mobs from even level to +2 ( +3 isn't too bad either).
---
Frostbolt 3-4 times -&gt; frost Nova -&gt; move to about half max range and frost bolt until about 15% then finish with wand.
---
Use your wand a lot and learn how to get your wand upgrades.
---
Shatter works on fire spells but seems to break the frost effect, so learn how to mix fire blast (upgrade fire blast) in right after frostbolt on frozen targets. It's sightly less Mana efficient, but you're only using it against mobs you can shatter and Mana efficiency isn't always better than kill speed. 
---
There are a ton of different combinations to be done depending on which frostbolt freezes your target.  If you get no procs on a +2/3 target you're going to want to learn how to blink effectively to create space and buy time for frost Nova to come off cd.  If you get even one proc off on an even level or lower mob it's a total walk in the park. 
---
Use evocation aggressively.  No need to beat a jrpg with 9999 heavy elixers mirite?

Here's the problem: Are you going to remove these versions? Are you going to add in a difficulty toggle? That's a step towards retail that many people aren't going to like for obvious reasons.
---
I agree with you, the private server versions of these dungeons were fun. I also don't like this cleave meta where the objectively best way to approach dungeons is to run in and aggro as much as you can possibly handle and just aoe them all down because you can. These dungeons should reward good CC and clean, smooth pulling. The only way that dynamic appears at the moment is if you're in a group trying to do something which is actually too high for them, like the stress test clears of WC and deadmines.

Yeah, that's the point..

Hey *hey hey* what's this sacrilege against Warcraft 3?!
---
hahah JK. but you know what, I in fact felt the opposite direction and felt that too many things about WoW back in 2005 when I first played didn't hold true enough to Warcraft 3.
---
I feel different today of course, but back then I was like:
---
- "Why do shamans get to wear mail at 40? They wore *cloth* in Warcraft 3...
---
heheh your comment on mages I'm not actually against, seeing that the horde had warlocks on their side(and necolytes if you go as far back as the original Warcraft RTS).
---
But yes how very interesting WoW Classic could have been, if they went by what things were like in Warcraft 2. Oh what a different game that would have been.
---
that's a dumb statement, that is like saying they won't ban anyone because they pay a sub/paid for the game (retail not classic), if it is against the ToU then they can ban for it at their discretion (i.e ban waves)
---
There are a whole lot of other posts too but ok

You could say the same about Gnomes though.

Not very funny

Being a pally healer / tank will give you the same buffs. Yes it counts towads dps but 2-3 pally healers can implement all the buffs needed in the raid
---
It's not hot-button to miss some of the features introduced that improved the game. Everyone does. I miss dual spec, incredible TBC class talents/balance, arena etc.
---
The challenge for Blizzard will be capturing all of those excellent QoL features while still maintaining the sense of  world and community that Vanilla had.
---
I don't think anyone has an answer on how to do that at the moment, save for a new iteration of WoW.
---
this exactly or do i need to insert the actual rank of drain soul?
---
While true, I would for give anyone for not knowing this one :p
---
That depends entirely. If you play for speed you get smite spec pre 40 which allows you to kill mobs much faster. Ofc you will have to reg mana after a few mobs hence back to wanding.
---
Private servers are harder in some areas too. Apes even said they didn’t realize how “easy” rag was on classic
---
Unpopular opinion, but expansions ruin games generally.

Armour fits them well and I personally like their casting animations, particularly FOL as a paladin, and you’re gonna see it a lot!

You may be banned for breaking an agreement if they payed you for something. But you cannot he banned for ninja looting. Assuming they didn't pay you, then I don't see a real reason why you would have gotten banned. Did you do something else?

But then again you never use summoning stone because YOU NEVER PLAYED VANILLA. How fucking dumb are you why do you not just piss of you fucking retarded autistic looser and understand that classic IS NOT VANILLA. God you are so wrong that you never look up the facts most likely because you can't fucking read either since there are proof ON THE INTERNET.
---
wtf is a " specialization point"?
---
Not a single media company has actually messaged me or asked if they could use any of my footage :/
---
You can also omit the "(Rank X)" part and I think it casts your highest rank learned.
---
Planned groups powerleveling to 60 are not indicative of the playerbase as a whole.
---
The best three hours! I loved when I could actually get 5 people who all were okay running the whole epic thing. 
---
Hopefully I can enjoy those days again now that classic has come back around!
---
We could have answered this pre launch.
---
Paladins heal in raids.  Ret sucks
---
welcome to a pvp server,  thats what happens on a pvp server. LOL
---
Yes. Check their news section, they covered this.
---
This isnt very accurate to full servers. On Incendius you're lucky to get 20s for Elemental Earth on the AH. Deeprock salt is on there for vendor prices. Multiple white AHable items are selling for a loss because people ignore that theirs an AH cut. Additionally all Elemental spots are camped constantly unless you're there from like 4am-9am
---
People care a lot about loot and get upset about it. 
---
I’ve seen multiple pugs in legion and BFA implode over loot. And this is with personal loot! A piece drops that someone doesn’t need. They put it up for roll. A healer rolls on a dps trinket. People lose their minds. They wanted that trinket. They *deserved* that trinket. 
---
At endgame, I can understand getting upset with people needing on another class’ pre-raid BiS to upgrade their questing greens, but in a leveling pug, an upgrade is an upgrade is an upgrade. Everyone is there for upgrades and unless you’re using the item at level 60 I don’t care how good it is for you. 
---
Obviously it’s a bit of a dick move to roll on a ranged weapon as a rogue when it’s a big upgrade for a hunter, or rolling on a set of +int bracers as a warrior because it has decent stamina and your questing bracers haven’t been replaced in 10 levels. 
---
But yeah, common sense goes out the window when people see a shiny piece of gear that they want. They picture it on their character and they get a rush of dopamine and when they lose the roll they can fall apart.
---
I'm just going to stealth onto the boat and immediately kill every Alliance priest I see, now.
---
I think so, pretty sure I saw OP a couple days ago in Tirisfal too and had a good laugh with the lads
---
that was a decent one yeah, and guilds that were missing people for their raid could look in there to see if there was any players looking for raids
---
My PC couldn't handle max settings, 14 years ago.
---
I see you are a gnome, are you sure you are not actually Satan?
---
You move to a different zone...
---
There doesn't need to be a reward for killing someone. The game is a conflict between Horde and Alliance, killing anyone of the opposing faction helps with that. It is this wrong idea what a pvp server is about that leads to these posts. You should have rolled on a pve realm.
---
I'm on Ashkandi too, and have been since launch day.
---
I haven't seen any queues in a week, and the population is often marked as high. I think we have a pretty decent population balance right now.
---
That's a small population of the fanbase honestly.  I traveled to there once completed my quests and hearthed out.  I see a lot of people only going when they need quests completed too.
---
It can be hard to keep your mouth shut about people being dumb as a healer. I get people are still getting used to classic's dynamics and I've only ran 5 dungeons so far. Each time the DPS and I were taking most of the damage.
---
Guild banks... I know in vanilla people used alts as guild banks but like the guild bank system they added in cata is so easy. I don't need or want guild repairs just a place I can easily donate stuff or money to the guild for anyone to use, honestly.
---
Spend the 25 for a widescreen monitor, you’ll be thankful later
---
finally an expl i can understand!, thx! do you think broken tooth might allow you to reduce it to 3/5 though?
---
Before the transfer. It was maybe an hour and a half. You don't need to go running on the game the second you get home from work. Shower, do things you need to do around the house while it's in queue. It does make things like playing during breaks hard, but it's not a big enough problem to go transferring to a potentially dead server imo
---
The only "off specs" are healers and tanks buying farming gear, or dps buying utility gear, like a dps warrior getting tank gear. All of those help the raid, too.
---
I can't think of why I would want a new player who hasn't raided to get free gear over a core raider who wants it.
---
Do you have max ranks of Permafrost and Improved Blizzard?  Those two talents are key.  Other than that it is straight-forward:  
---
* Tag mobs
---
* Frost nova once they all move in
---
* Run backward
---
* Line up Blizzard
---
* Keep moving the AoE hitbox and channeling until dead
---
My guild is doing loot council. I'm hopeful that it will work well, but only time will tell.
---
A couple of guilds I've been in in the past have had officers that practice nepotism, so I can only hope this time is different.
---
Wow TIL. Thank you for that.
---
It has gotten faster and faster it seems. For me personally it’s cool. I like it. I work better on pure instinct than what I can deliver from any plan. I am more or less same in real life and all sports I have been doing has been high energy, fast and instinct prone. In addition I hate any kind of strategy games.....
---
You know what kind of answers you’ll get from a sub like this. 
---
Personally I’d say it’s likely things stay quite active for a few months at least, I wouldn’t worry too much.
---
Old talents are a million times better and it's the best reason to play classic WoW if they restored it. WoW was a top notch game in 2005-2008 and it started to get too crazy after that.
---
Shove your cat into the screen
---
&gt; Is there any point in taking this? Im leveling as enhance thinking it would be better to get elemental weapons and improved wep totems instead
---
It's very good for leveling and shaman tanking.
---
This is exactly what I'm doing. I think this is the way to go.
---
If I happen to get ahold of a good dagger, I might consider points in Opportunity instead of Master of Subtlety... but I'm not yet sure that it's worth losing the stealth levels... they can be really useful when navigating through higher level mobs.
---
My druid is level 16 with 3 copper to his name. Leveling every profession and buying wands for my friends and sharing money between us all means we’re all really poor haha but it’s been a blast!
---
Dude thanks I was gonna ask the same thing!! ElvUI was pretty intimidating to set up right.
---
This is a little strong, pre-40 I used Holy Fire as the opener and barely had to drink/heal.  I’d float at like 60-80% mana but you don’t really need 100% mana at the end of every kill when it’s just sitting there.
---
We have quite a few already. Some would say too many.
---
I hit 40 as well last night..   Warlock mount :)
---
They still need food dont they.
---
? 4g at 18 is normal
---
It would almost certainly be better to scrap them and get residuum to try and get a better piece than holding on them for a hypothetical 0.1% increase.
---
Considering the post crying about him failing classic wow is one of the most upvoted post on this subreddit I'd say lots of people care. It's lazyness of your part to pretend people don't care just because you don't care.
---
Oh, look, more orcs! 
---
Oh shit, guess I’ll die!
---
How do you move your pet?
---
Just bring some good food (for well fed buff) and bandages and you should be fine.
---
VanCleef hits pretty hard, you may want to aggro the boss and have a dps take adds.
---
Dude the realm literally opened yesterday and people can't even make new characters yet....
---
Also there's a plethora of old dps players who want a change in classic so they try going heals. I'm one of them.. former rogue going resto druid at 60.
---
What is a good alignment addon? I just redid my ui last night. While it’s close I would like to make sure it’s 100% center
---
Guards will not attack you if you initiate combat on the boat. Not sure why there are no guards on the boats
---
dM iS dIrE mAuL.
---
No one gives a toss, everyone in this thread knows that they’re referring to Deadmines seeing as Dire Maul isn’t actually in the game right now :)
---
What census...
---
There’s definitely RP, but it’s having a slow start. Most people are focused on leveling; I know personally if I don’t hit 60 before really getting into RP I’ll *never* hit 60.
---
Very very few people are actually dungeon grinding SM for 24 levels.  You just feel like they are because they aren’t playing the game the way you expect them to.  Just mind your own business and let them play how they want.
---
Stupid hunters and your ability to have a minimalistic UI... I’m over here playing a priest... we got all the a shadow abilities and healing abilities and then we gotta downrank... not to mention 40 raid frames. Man am I ever not excited for that.
---
So let’s say up is defensive, down is zerker. How would you get back to battle? Another key bind?
---
Prior to MoP Sargeras was 40/60 A/H, and that was on Shadowburn....so, your point was what? That some of us have no clue what unbalanced PvP is? That’s all I knew, as did many Alliance.
---
You know how to take a screenshot, but instead take a cellphone picture of a screen and game with built in screenshot functionality. 
---
 So you’re an idiot on purpose. Gotcha.
---
18? Lol I can't even decide on what class to play. Seeing people at level 18 makes me go "Lucky, you can decide!"
---
Exactly. The first drop id say "Hey, I'm only here for the greens. Don't roll on them or I'm gonna leave." They do it again, I leave. I don't just sit there quiet the whole dungeon plotting to steal the end loot like a psychopath
---

Owl is the best for leveling.

I mean, if everyone played perfectly you wouldn't need to do a lot of things.

I've read where a lot of people suggest your first 3 for global cd then go into demon a bit before coming back to fill out the remaining 5. All preference though.
---
Yup! Installed the latest version and this is now fixed. Thanks
---
Have you guys measured the difference in XP gain?  It might not be that huge a loss and could potentially speed him up a ton.
---
I'm on a high pop server (PVE though) and have never been queued, I waited 5 days before starting though
---
Funny, me and my 40 priest buddy we’re in the middle of mind controlling someone when they scurried below deck
---
You just flipped my whole world upside down. Anytime I've ever heard anyone mention him they pronounce it Mankirk
---
Yup, you're on the right track. Just make sure you guys are not in the same group, get him to tag the mob(s) then you can step in kill everything and he will get all the exp his little warrior ass deserves :)
---
Pro tip: Throw a raid marker on him for easy tracking
---
Happy hunting, Jamma
---
Transmog.
---
You nailed it. /thread
---
What you're describing is the lfg addon lol...
---
I'd bring detailed char stats.  Not having them is just annoying and nothing else.
---
You could just approach Retail like you approach Classic
---
&gt; Everyone in forums says there is no such thing as Shaman DPS in Vanilla for raids, its Resto or no invite.
---
&gt; What does a shaman that wants to DPS spec for in raids, elemental or enhancement. We are talking MC and BWL.
---
&gt; What does a shaman go in PVP?
---
Unless you're aiming for world first or progression shaman dps is fine.
---
Some people didn’t leave sm for 20 levels fifteen years ago, either. If you care about what other people not in your group are doing in an instance that’s your business but it’s probably not good for your blood pressure.
---
all the slow bonuses you get from frost talents make kiting and killing mobs above your level very easy.
---
Reason #53637 I play on a normal server lol
---
Reddit af
---
YES. Retail is totally inflated. You out level everything really fast.
---
The thing I love most about vanilla is that your professions (if you're actively training them) usually match with your zone. By the time you are done with linen cloth in tailoring, you're probably moving on to wool drops from mobs.
---
In retail you're forced to waste time farming materials from stuff that offers you no experience. It makes professions a massive bore.
---
No you devolved to that in your last post. As I saud, you provided 0 arguments and just called me a scrub loser.
---
I simply reciprocated.
---
You thi!

I queue and then typically eat and/or do my workout while waiting.

This is a great way to do it! I also then keybind these to the scroll wheel - I shift to cat by scrolling down annear with up. And once I get travel form I will make it scroll wheel click :)
---
Probably because it has a wide level range. Statistics would help you understand.
---
There's more people within the age range of 28-52 than in the age range of 18-22.
---
.kill
---
I didn't see it mentioned, but in addition to a gathering and production profession (like herbalism and alchemy for example) everyone can also get cooking, fishing, and first aid on top of those.
---
You should be able to do:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [form:1/3] Faerie Fire (Feral)
---
    /cast [noform] Faerie Fire
---
You might need to play around with the spell names a bit but it should work fine.
---
Funny enough, I have clicked since I started WoW.
---
Worth mentioning I have raided every tier since Wrath at a high level, its def a bad habit but honestly unless you are PvPing, its pretty easy to get away with.
---
More direct flight pathing
---
I genuinely have no idea, but this is happening on several servers from the posts I see here in my thread.
---
True but that's an easy way to kill a guild and its reputation.
---
Mine is stuck at 215-2-17 not going down anymore. not since half an hour.
---
I get the distrust but why would they turn Classic into BfA when BfA already exists. They are not stupid, if Classic pulls higher numbers than BfA theyll understand what kinda game people want to play.
---
There should be gun ammo called mind bullets that do arcane damage.
---
same  Gehennas EU  stuck on 210 for 20 min
---
It's really not
---
As long as the other characters aren't botting, what they do is they bind the key presses to each of the windows using a 3rd party program, though I am sure you knew that since you know what multiboxing is. As long as he has to push the button for them to do their job and the accounts are paid it is A-OK
---
Druid checking in, np.

This is how I base whether I can tank something, by checking the levels of the boss:

Oh god can we please turn the AH into a plain letter roulette? That'd be SO awesome.

Well video games are addictive vices naturally. They are fillled with opportunities constantly giving your brain a sense of reward/happiness and dopamine release. Part of drug addiction comes from your brain getting used to and depending on dopamine releases and when it doesn’t get them or not enough of them that’s when you experience things like moodiness/withdrawal.
---
Trade chat was used for groups throughout Vanilla. You're fighting a losing battle.
---
Blizzard doesn’t ban for ninja looting. You used language that was inappropriate most likely
---
It was really fast, I don't remember exactly tho. I'll run it again later.
---
I'm having the same issue with Herod-Horde, its been 3 hours and queries only go up.
---
If they are healing? Sure.
---
In PvP, Bombs were more used for it's CC than it's Damage. So I think they just use the Steel ones if I remember right because they were cheap?
---
i can second kritonos is a great server.     im running a horde guild if anyone is looming for help lvling up stay with us at max level
---
Don't worry about what others are doing and you'll have a way better experience
---
I'd have a lot more money than I currently do if I weren't leveling enchanting.  It's such a money sink.  BoE green I could sell or auction?  Disenchanted.  Gear I've made with Tailoring?  Disenchanted.  Cloth I could sell or auction?  Tailored then disenchanted.  At this point the only thing I could make and then sell is wands, but that's an inefficient use of dust and essences, and I haven't found anybody interested in paying for low level enchants.
---
might as well, like i said the ring is worth it. youll probably end up with that ring equipped all the way to the 50's tbh
---
Same issue. Was stuck at ~526 for a while and now I've very slowly dropped to ~511.
---
Yeah exactly same behavior! I thought I was deluded
---
Nobody gonna comment on those emote macros? All fine and dandy until you get to the one sanctioned off by itself for /spit. Bravo.
---
same here 210
---
There is a portal trainer usually located very close to the mage trainers in SW and Org
---
Doing God’s work
---
I would say ashenvale is a good place to go, you can get the flight paths and eventually run BFD which has a quest inside for the best wand you can get at low levels.
---
Sorry but you aren't going to convince anyone. Its what we did in vanilla, they are going to keep doing.
---

Much like sponges, they've mostly been replaced with artificial ones made from plastic.
---
Is playing subtlety rogue viable in pve? I like it vastly over combat
---
Healing is way more interesting in classic than dpsing unless you're just tank healing.
---
Retail and classic druid enthusiast here. The only macro you really need in classic is a single /cancelform so you can bind it to a key. Even powershifting is easy enough with just that. Don't get me wrong, expanding on that for all the abilities you might want to cast out of form or having a single macro for powershifting is nice, but far from necessary.
---
Has anyone confirmed you can MC and buff the opposing faction? I've tried twice and it hasn't worked. Video evidence would go far here. I KNOW you could do it in vanilla. I used to do it. But I can't get it to work now, and these unwilling subjects are getting testy.
---
No, I tested this numerous times. Don’t actually log out though. Just log in on the new machine.
---
Congrats you dungeon spammed just like retail, you really wanted that classic experience didn't you loser?
---
Thank you for pointing this out. I removed it and added an accurate link to use.
---
Auction them! You can make a lot more for just a little more effort
---
It’s been part and parcel of humanity since day dot, outrage culture  is a myth.

I'm personally more salty about Horde getting the second best fishing pole for just completing a quest whereas Alliance need to grind underwater cages for the third best fishing pole.
---
Pehaps I shall try when I get home and not restricted by my place of employment's webproxy.
---
Uh duh, just deband it? Lol /s
---
Plus you can just AH all the mats at 60 and save yourself an ungodly amount of time and effort.
---
Hard to tell yet. My own friend group has all returned to the game, but we'll see how many of us are still playing in a month or two.
---
...no? Draconic Deflector is better than Skullflame.
---
I'm not saying people aren't out n about, its just ironic how dungeon finder was shunned but the problem in classic is that people who want to do dungeons are discouraged from questing because of all the hurdles they face. 
---
The result is logging out in undercity and logging back in and sitting in SM for 20 levels.
---
Flying to fuckong ruin it you mean. Fuck flying mounts. They absolutely ruined any feel of a persistent world.

WoW classic is very small but you should still have an install folder for World of Warcraft. In there, there's a classic subfolder and then Interface -&gt; Addons

That's pretty much what I want. Especially if I make someone salty over winning by luck. And the ghost wolf teabag is just insult to injury. I totally forgot that was a thing.

Unfortunately you really need gnome racial and engineering to handle mages.

How about looking for a guild by using the chat function while logged in instead of a reddit post?
---
AHAHAHA Fuck yeah dude! That is amazing, I'm saving that, new wallpaper. Cheers

If the was frozen it would be moving at all. The fluctuation is likely some people getting dced and logging in on priority queue. Its just no one logging out.

To add, get off social media. Like he compares himself to his cousins, feel like most people instinctively compare themself to whoever is on their Twitter/Facebook feed or whatever.

That is an \[Overgrown Briarthorn\] which is a world quest objective. You need to get to max level and unlock world quests to gather it.

Fuck towelliee, I never liked him..

have a problem with dps too (because i'm the tank and my brother the healer :D )

it's always a rogue, or enhance shammy, or feral druid trying to off-tank things

I love his reaction after your skyrim quote.

Night Elf Priest is also fun since you can ambush people using Shadowmeld.

You asked for data, I give you data. Now you complain that I didnt personally make the sim?

Meanwhile what do you have? Your words saying "bruh my slam does 100 dmg and my auto only 80 youre wrong".

I have made arguments you cant even respond to.
---
7% niss chance on your main hand loool. You thought that main hand has only 7% when dual wielding. Like you dont understand hit mechanics at all.  You dont even know the proper miss chance, and you are trying to theory craft.

Why would I put in more detailed math arguments with someone who clearly knows jack shit?
---
you must eliminate the other shadow priest and take his place. there can be only one

We're also SPECIFICALLY talking about China here...

Are you in the lfg channel?

Thank you for the explanation. I really do not like that. I prefer more people on a server even if I do have to compete for resources.
---
Oh absolutely and I love it when I get AI on my Hunter so that I can fire off more magical arrows. Thank you.
---
I gotta wonder though, does Dampen Magic affect Mend Pet? I'm not saying you should or shouldn't cast that as part of your drive-by buffing habits but it's just something I thought of right now and I don't have a definitive answer.

Haha! I used to play a mage and was usually top DPS but I realize all I was doing was pushing "2" for frostbolt most my career
---
Is griefing people cool?
---
I'm the priest MCing. I'm pretty sure it isn't working because I see the buff animation on myself as the MC breaks. And the other guy always acts confused.
---
The stockades questline that starts with the letter from killing van cleef is good. 
---
The fordring questline is good to do because the rewards are usually preraid bis for a lot of classes.
---
interested in hearing more about the wow guild, could i get a invite to the discord and some information please. thinking about making the plunge today back into classic haha .
---
[Flightmasters](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes_flightmasters-classic)
---
Yeah that quest was kinda annoying with all the legwork but I got to the end and was like 'imma kill the shit out of this motherfucker'
---
I think Smite is better , I haven't even trained holy fire. So far I've been doing PWS&gt;Smitex2&gt;Mind Blast&gt;SWP&gt;wand til dead and it's been great. Depending on how current your wand is compared to the rank of Smite, one is going to be more useful though. I just got Smite 5 at 30 and have the Gravestone scepter from BFD so I'm kind of set either way, but looking at my dps meter before 30 it was better to just wand instead of smiting twice sometimes.
---
no real limit, just what your computer can handle and what you can deal with. I would get Classic cast bar, real mob health and better vendor prices. Everything else is for what you like to do.
---
&gt; Not to mention the Tauren players aren't even able to do certain Forsaken quests while the Orcs and Trolls are allowed to do so.
---
This is news to me. Which quests are these?

It was complained about because you don't have to do anything in the world and level up a character by spamming.  You enter a queue and are teleported into and out of the instance.
---
The way it is now people are hitting up trade, and still have to run to their dungeon (unless they have a warlock).  Its a massive difference that you fail to notice, try running into SM as Alliance for example.  
---
Also, you cannot sit in SM for 20 levels, the trash is only lvl 40 in Cathedral.  Most people will move into ZF at around 44, and then to BRD at around 53.
---
Because I wanted to be an alliance mage but not a filthy gnome.

Shimmering Flats will get a level and a half

My spirit tap never seemed to proc even when I had it at rank 5. Am i missing something? Do I have to get the killing blow and therefore it's only useful for solo leveling? I'm new-to-WoW and have been playing primarily in 2 person parties when not dungeoning so if that has an effect that would be it? 
---
I've already spec'd out of the talent because it seem'd like 5 points that were wasted (I know I'm not supposed to do 5, just kept having mana issues so I went all in to test).
---
This is my approach too.  +stam is a bit lower, but I don't overthink it too much.  Just give me more of some combo of those, and hopefully SOME spirit, and I'll make it work.
---
I think you're referring to the Trolls around the lake next to Moonglade:  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shatterspear\_Vale](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shatterspear_Vale)

 Yesterday I helped an undead get to the zeppelin towards undercity, He was lost in the valley of honor. He didn't thank me either.  :'(
---
Theres like a slider in the graphics menu, did you mess with that
---
Do you REALLY level that quickly doing SM? I thought it would take 30+ runs?
---
I need to play on Judgement or Ten Storms, I can't find them under the English realms. What to do*?
---
And while your at it, pick up at juicy staff from Library!
---
Childish is taking the video this guy posted so seriously that you feel the need to log onto World of Warcraft (a video game) and cyber bully other players for being different than you. You’re a joke
---
LOL Made those gloves for myself today -- might have to check the AH's market on them \*rubs hands together\*
---
Damn I wanna play this game now...

&gt;ruman was the worse president that the United States has ever had.  When Chinese hegemony finally topples the US, it will have been the inevitable result of Truman not letting MacArthur do what had to be done.
---
Yep, Every day into the 21st century is another day that proves Truman was naive in thinking Chinese communism and American Ideals could co-exist.  
---
Korea is the worlds best example of why MacArthur was actually right.
---
What are the boxes? Sorry for asking stupidly
---
This is correct. Going 3 pts puts it at 1.2 second cast and then you go into demo to AT LEAST get 3/3 into improved Voidwalker so he can actually hold threat against your massive long dots.
---
It doesn’t feel like it does much. I’m not speccing holy so I think I’m phasing it out.
---
Unless you don't dot on command. Then -50 dkp.

I used to make and use these during Wrath in Alterac Valley.  Not sure if they worked the same in Classic, but in Wrath they did an AoE silence to go along with the little damage so I'd sit next to my boss in stealth (I was a rogue), and as soon as they got going I'd hit the healers with it and about half the time that was enough to cause a wipe. It won us a few close ones. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it was fun knowing I caused a wipe alone. I could see it being used that way when the world bosses hit during contested pulls.
---
lmfaoooo id tip the lad a copper
---
THIS \^\^\^\^  
---
The +5% spirit isn't "bad" either. Fear ward is great for PvP but if you're enjoying the game and don't care about min/max'ing the hell out of your life... have fun!
---
(X) Doubt
---
Regardless of the repercussions, it’s still enforcement.
---
Ehhh it’s just an opinion, I figure they would just burn out by the time they are where they want to be. What else is left ? Wait for phase 2? Doesn’t sound fun.  Running dungeons non stop is not fun from what I’ve experienced. I’m a warrior and I’m having fun. Although a bit difficult at times, I like a challenge.
---
I'm kinda stuck right now. 
---
Just hit level 32, Horde warrior.  I've been leveling in Thousand Needles/Hillsbrad. 
---
I got to the point in the Shimmering Flats where they're sending me to Booty Bay and Ratchet. Then in Hillsbrad, I got a Desolace quest and one Ogre quest.
---
Should I do Arathi Highlands or Desolace?
---
Also: Healing Alliance-friendly mobs in Horde zones.
---
Use at your own risk.  He said they cannot approve anything...I’m telling you someone got banned for it.  I’m not going to argue anymore I was just trying to help.
---
I have been using:  
---
WeaponSwingTimer (must have as a melee class or hunter)  
---
Questie (makes questing much more enjoyable and quicker)  
---
Immersion (makes questing and interacting with NPCs more fun)  
---
VendorPrice (shows how much you can sell something to a vendor)  
---
Auctioneer (helps you make buying and selling decisions on the AH)  
---
Bagnon (makes an all-in-one bag)  
---
Classic Castbars (shows what spell an enemy is casting)  
---
Shadow Unit Frames (allows for more info on unit frames)  
---
GatherLite (adds a pin to each gathering node you find)  
---
I don't think there is a limit to how many addons you can have. But make sure it isn't affecting your performance.
---
The village between moon glade and dark shore? Yea it’s a dense area with decent loot tables. Hard to get to, not technically cheating
---
wtf are those binds?
---
^this.. the linken chain quest line is a must do
---
Most tanks and healers are dps specced with whatever gear they have to swap in until much later. You'll be fine.
---
I throw recklessness on mobs that are fighting magic damage users, cause I like to watch them get hit even harder.
---
thanks for this deep insight
---
Second this.  Cross realm BG was introduced towards the end of Vanilla, so we will see them.
---
Body types aren't really a thing. People who are huge and ripped just work *really hard* and most of us don't.
---
You just scroll over who you want to heal and click, shift click, right click etc. Auto pw:forts out of combat. Not a ton easier but definitely a bit. Also shows what the heal will heal them too while casting.
---
I think we've all read the same material here guys! :D
---
Looted from the arena chest!
---
Holy is actually faster at lower levels until you hit 40 and even then it’s not that bad. Mindflay is a waste of mana at lower levels and with spirit tap, wand spec, and the holy crit and cast time talents you can do more damage and stay at essentially full mana all the time while questing.
---
What are those boxes? Never had a rogue past lvl 28 LOL
---
I've always used DKP, so how does loot council actually work in practice? Officers of each class determine where loot goes based on the individual's raid attendance, number of items received throughout total raiding history with guild, number of items received that night, etc? 
---
Also, what about multi-class items, like weapons? I'd think guilds should have a flowchart for each possible item drop. An example would be, say, Core Hound Tooth. Rogues get first priority, if no rogues want it, fury warriors can roll to use it as an offhand, followed by hunters. Is this a thing? It should be.
---
Not very common, check petopia, majority is 2.0
---
Private servers for MMOs like, say, Trickster or Phantasy Star arbitrarily changed exp values and nobody batted an eye. The only reasons I could see this being a problem for classic are:
---
A: It would conflict with the museum-like, #nochanges design of preserving classic.
---
B: Getting levels faster than gear would severely affect pacing. Going into dungeons that are suggested for your level without having been fortunate enough to get enough armor on tanks or mana on healers would suck. Not to mention that for end-game raids at this point, getting max level isn't even a requirement for much of your players. So trivializing leveling as a progression system seems like a poor decision.
---
They compete with one another for your pets GCD, as well as growl, and Ylyou want your pet to get as many chances at Crits as possible for frenzy to stay active indefinitely. Claw is also much cheaper and has no cooldown.
---
aw this is really sad, and this is coming from a decade-long ally main
---
a quest addon like questie?
---
Isn’t the southern landmass Kezan’s original location?
---
I left the queue then rejoined and it seems to have started going in the right direction. Not sure if that’s just coincidence though!
---
Just because your not the best doesn't mean your not viable.
---
I love choosing to not learn stuff. I think I could just buy sinister strike and eviscerate all the way to lvl 60
---
Depends on how good your wand is and how recently you got a smite level.
---
I have been able to upgrade my wand for a while and smite is definitely better dps for me until I can get the one from BFD.
---
I agree, as soon as i hit 30 i could go everywhere but for only a limited amount of time before i was told to go across the planet again, the idea of questing in thousand needles, then going to hillsbrad then to stv then leave stv after 6 quests to go back to simmering flats to go back to stv to go back to arathi highlands to go back to stv, really made want to just sit in SM.
---
The Darkspear are pretty chill. That's mostly just because they aren't allowed to do anything though.
---
Significantly raising exp rates to get people to max level world pvp/battlegrounds is a pretty terrible idea imo. 
---
If you want to pvp you have the option of doing so at any level, whether it is world pvp, or in battlegrounds when they get released. People like classic because of the journey and feeling their character grow and mature over time. With largely increased exp rates any joe schmoe like me would get on for an hour or two and easily get 5 levels (basically retail speed leveling).
---
Retail as it stands today is a game tailored for the max level experience whereas classic is tailored for the MMORPG that focuses on the journey.
---
It's the easiest way for stupid people to mock someone. Instead of giving their retort any actual thought, they just alternate caps lock.
---
WTB Tank for DM 5s
---
Focus fire the mobs or else your healer will be OOM after every pull. Mobs do the same amount of damage at 1% or 100%.
---
These STV trolls at the North West temple throwing spears.

---
It's inevitable at some point, but with the help of layering they have made some REALLY populous servers, so I don't see them needing a merge for quite some time.
---
How are you not a dwarf?
---
Imagine leveling resto in classic.
---
Was about to gank a random dude I was running past so I garrote and vanish as the garrote would have had plenty of damage to finish the job. Mob dies and he levels.

If you're not using an addon for party frames you should turn on raidframes in party and turn on class colors and resize them and stuff.  Default party ui is shit for healing imo.
---
Looks like someone's in time out.
---
Right, an enforcement which hurts certain industries, certain labourers and communities more generally. It's a form of enforcement which heightens the problem in my opinion (and I think empirical evidence supports this)
---
You don’t need to buy all your spells.

I have only upgraded conjured food/water , frostbolt and arcane intellect. I’ll upgrade everything else at some point.

Fishing pools in azshara made me almost 50k in 3months in vanilla. So calling it a waste is.. Not fair.
---
Bagnon it very nice
---
Impossible by level 40. Even if you do every quest that grants stormwind rep, you still won't get there at 60 without donating hundreds of runecloth, which is the only repeatable city rep quest, at least before the AQ event.
---
Ever heard of Mapster?
---
You have to do a bit of setup for Buffwatch. Check the boxes to "lock" those current buffs on that player, you can Alt+Right Click to remove ones that you can't cast, then click the button when it turns red.

How do I get SM spam groups as a rogue? The groups I see being spammed in LFG are all asking for warlock/mage dps only and one invited me then kicked me saying they thought I was a mage. Wtf
---
No u
---
It's honestly the wild west out there when it comes to the AH. Prices dont make sense. People sell things below vendor price and set the starting bid at 1c. Your AH deposit + the AH cut can quickly lose you money when that item you sold cost 6s to deposit but you only sold it for 15, yet you could have vendored it for 10.
---
No you both
---
Do they have this picture in GIF format?
---
Dudes right, really hard to find a BFD group....
---
It was the same when I went from daggers to swords on my rogue. I promptly forgot and got slain hard. Lesson learned!
---
Well they did say the 1.12 experience so we can use educated guesses.  Great glad we got there.
---
True.
---
As a feral druid who raided as both tank and dps as feral back in 2006, please take the melee crit trinket. For tanking, threat is arguably more imporant than avoidance from the dodge. 2% dodge trinket is great for a Patchwerk fight but by then you will have maxed armor and insane health to tank the hits anyway. The crit will allow your dps to hold back less.
---
The spell crit does not effect dots and hots so its value is diminished for a druid.
---
OP should chill out a bit and he would prob get laid more often
---
We are going to try out suicide kings and see how it plays out. I see the weaknesses and strengths to it but over all it’s a fairly easy system.
---
Battle grounds killed world pvp dont kid yourself
---
So far in classic i have not sold one item for silver yet, unless i cant give them away. I hang on to them my whole playing session until i see someone who can use the item. I then continue to trade the item away for nothing. I love contributing to a good community.
---
Holy shit the racism against Chinese in this thread is staggering.
---
Anyway, sucks that you have to deal with this shit.. hope Blizz acts on the evidence and takes a stand.
---
the end game in fishing and cooking is BUFF food.   it might not heal as much as lvl 55 mage food, but it gives useful buffs
---
Hot damn thanks for the info!
---
what about staves?
---
Lmfao and I thought the Druid clipping inside couldn't be tooped
---
This is probably it.   My client crashed and I was able to dodge queue to get back in.
---
Exactly. I honestly don’t understand the confusion.
---
I’m 44, had the first week off, single, no kids, weed and a leveling guide ;) going to slow down now though. Kinda went to ham that first week.
---
No problem friend! It's literally the very first thing I did in Classic lol.
---
You can turn off the camera auto 'fixing' in your settings.  There's a drop down box, should have a never option. It will keep the camera from rotating back over your shoulder.
---
Sound like a pretty good run. Keep it up and appreciate your tanks
---
This is a nonissue.
---
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe that will work. Multiple lines of /cast for spells that trigger the GCD (global cooldown) will just cast the first one, at least in retail. And I believe Classic uses the same macro system.
---
So,to my knowledge, that would just cast Corruption every time it's pressed and maybe also trigger the wand.
---
it's the OP for the second season of Yuru Yuri (literally translates to 'laidback lesbians')

Thank you for the new tool!

Ayyy 15 minutes of extra stats in a 40+ minute long raid. This is minmaxing at its second finest. The FINEST minmaxing I’ve seen is lvl 60s who go to Teldrassil and camp the bogling quest spawns for that sweet sweet +1 damage.
---
it’s just supposed to be a quick reference of zone ordering. thank you for appreciating it
---
I was just finishing up a (very rare) successful three-pull with my Hunter when an idiot Druid ran up, dragging two other mobs, and died right on top of me. So it turned into an unsuccessful five-pull.
---
Holy fuck you're stupid.
---
Yes, Hunters have a mana bar.  That doesn't mean that they need int gear.
---
Jesus Christ....
---
To the sharpies!
---
I don't think it's tied to anything in particular, you just get it at level 25 in the Stormwind warlock trainer basement
---
I when I try this out, it casts corruption, then says that ‘the spell is not ready’, then uses the wand and I say ‘null’ out loud
---
You have money left over after training? And you got ALL the skills!?
---
Simple question:  Is there a defacto (safe) wow addons site that everyone is using for wow classic? Is it still curse gaming?
---
&gt; so I just end up hangin out drinking and talking to ppl.
---
Isn't... that the whole point? lol.
---
I've been levelling as ds/ruin and after reading these comments I guess that's not the right levelling spec! Oops. Ah well I'm level 36 now just gonna keep rolling with it
---
so you pulled aggro from a mob when you were already low health? that's your fault.
---
I like the tabard design :0
---
Except those beautiful polearms. 1G to learn how to swing those bad boys
---
It's not a great farming class. In raids they are expected to be resto as well, so you've got the same issue as the priest. If its not your raid class and you keep it dps spec it still isn't nearly the farmer that Hunter, lock, mage, druid, or shadow priest is.
---
As a life tap heavy warlock...
---
You are doing it wrong.
---
If you cannot self heal afterwards, you NEVER lifetap to one hit.
---
Improved Healthstone, improved life drain, bandages, potions.
---
You really don’t ever have to drink as a warlock, especially if you go affliction heavy to level.
---
I hadn’t even thought of this and now I can’t wait

Gratz! Getting mine today after work.
---
This is actually one of the biggest reasons I was excited to return to classic. Seriously. This and playing a rogue to gank people on boats/zeppelins. Don’t judge me.
---
The best part of doing this is when you challenge someone to a duel and they accept. Than you can throw your own faction off hahahaha
---
Think about this guy the next time I hear another Alliance moron in chat bitching how Horde are assholes because they attack Alliance players randomly.
---
You have assholes like this guy fueling that rage.
---
Do they really?  That'd be good news...
---
Your guess is braindead you basically said yeah they'll group them.  That's what fucking cross realm is how would you have crossrealm without battlegroups.  I'm gonna block you I'm fairly certain I never want to see anything you have to say again.  Bye
---
I've always liked the simplicity of healing during the early expansions. Got way too complicated after MoP.
---
With my macro the pet will attack on every button push, so the pet will attack on the first click. You can't make a macro cast multiple spells with one click so of course it will require multiple clicks.
---
Nice! Glad it worked for you!
---
It's funny, I would often hear about the Tauren-exclusive Undead quest(s), but the only thing I could dig up through google is an [Undead-exclusive Tauren quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1049/compendium-of-the-fallen) (can be completed by Orcs and Trolls too though).
---
Yeah I played them a ton it’s just insane the difference I’m not complaining but like I was so bored healing it! Our dps was low but the mobs did no damage so it was me autoattacking and using a heal when necessary (I’m a shaman) and it took ages it felt like there just was 0 fear of death the entire run just a cloth and ore grab for me
---
Thats a good vendor price
---
How is it greed? The BoE has equal value for the entire group and that is the AH price of it. Yes, one player could equip it.. or the others could sell it and buy a BoE that equally benefits them.
---
It certainly isn't an altruistic approach, but what you are advocating is the equivalent of giving your money to a party member so that they can buy their gear.
---
Blizzard cares more about money than fairness.

Somewhat related: I am curious to know what people here think about the go-to progression of zones from 10 to 60 for maximum fun, assuming you are NOT trying to speedrun and don't care about efficiency. In other words, what is your favorite sequence of zones after your starter area, that just feels the most like a real epic journey, or that takes you to places that you really like the look and feel of, or that have the most engaging quest lines overall.
---
lol why black out your in game name?

Finally feel kinship with a member of the horde. &lt;3

Cool history bro, posts asking for the best class since you quit in Legion, shitty posts telling misinformed people like you that Classic is dying already.   
---
Way to go.
---
Or you could choose to life tap a little bit less. When you are with this healer anyway. Or you could just keep doing what you are doing with every healer and get a reputation as that Warlock who stresses out Healers and doesn't know the meaning of moderation.
---
Up to you.
---
Are you actually planning to make a new character on this realm?  I keep seeing people say this, but have yet to have someone who is actually going to roll on the new servers...

Hey that's me I am Questgiver my guildie sent me a link to this lol

I had never heard of it before but just checked the trailer out it looks pretty dope.

Glad you got it working! That is a crazy long macro though with some conditionals that aren't necessary, which makes me believes it should work with more simplified code.

You don't have to keep testing, but I'm a bit curious now. Maybe specifying 'nomod' is necessary here:

That’s exactly what’s happening when I try it
---
Thats my boat...
---
Of all the things that weren't in Vanilla,  layering is super down on my list in terms of things that matter.
---
I just wait to see if people are gonna be the group douche, and if I see people rolling need on items they cant use, I'll also roll need. Subsequently, if I win the roll, I give the item go the person that actually needs it.  If no one needs it, then all good. But the words Need and Greed are very specific in what they mean.  
---
By your logic we should be needing on every piece of loot that drops because they all have some sort of value.
---
Im actually waiting for cod mw. 10 times better than any other game right now
---
So I played on a private server years ago.  A lot of stuff wasn't scripted right or was just plain broken.  One of the funnier broken interactions was Mankrik's Wife.  She was still a corpse, but a standing one that did idle animations and had verbal dialog lines on click.  It was great.
---
Hard to play anything else now. I love Stealth too much
---
Why not buy them all immediately and sell whatever you get.
---
You clearly dont play warlock

She hit alt-f4 and forgot her password.

Listen to the argument...  It's not about your random 'a dime a dozen' boe green crappy item....  It's about those  &lt;0,1% of the items in the database that for SOME REASON are worth 100g instead of 13s. 
---
the 200g Staff of Jordan.  or the 150g lvl 19 twink BiS  Sword  Or the lvl 50 Krol Blade that might be 500g at some point.
---
The JACKPOT items.  The kind of items you will  ONLY see drop once in your entire lifecycle as a character. 
---
Those items, the general opinion is, are NEED for everybody in PuGs . Because they make SUCH a big difference.   
---
 NOTA BENE:  In guilds or friend groups,  this is different.. You can have your own social codes there, we are talking strangers here.
---
It is all about the hits you get in, which is why Flurry, Ironfoe, and MCP are some of the best weapons because they give extra hits for their swing speed. Most of your damage comes from SoR and other on hit effects (haven't been able to test it on classic). Consecrate has pretty poor scaling, and you don't go far enough down into holy for holy shock (in fact, the one talent build I have seen for spelladin goes all the way down the ret tree).
---
It's actually a great time to level crafting because of how cheap materials are on the ah atm.
---
Botting and using third party programs I can understand is a form of cheating but saying that farming for RWT is "cheating" is a grey area. Just because something is against TOS doesn't make it cheating..
---
My friends aren't getting bans but okay.
---
Well I was being a little facetious while also making a point that spreading negativity isn’t necessary. And pointing out every time someone is wrong is sometimes just annoying rather than helpful.
---
Nope, everyone REEE'd about the LFG addon saying this is what they wanted, so this is how it's gonna be. #nochanges
---
More fun MC'ing people in the lava in BRM
---
Job rules, relationship rules, friends rule, and I got time to play WoW. Couldn't be happier.
---
biggest piece of advice is there are many skills you don't have to train!  i have easily 10 skills that i could get but have no reason to
---
&gt; Truth hurts don't it?
---
You make good points. I will say that most of my distaste for needing for BoEs stems from the assumption that people are doing this underhandedly. As long as people are upfront about the fact that as a group everyone should need roll on BoEs it doesn't sit badly with me, but going into a dungeon with this mentality and not warning your group makes someone just as much of a ninja as the people they imagine they are guarding themselves against.
---
No idea about europe.  Really my only question in this whole thing is will naw and nae servers be grouped at all.  I expect we won't get an answer from blizz until everything is stable and they see how many servers they're working with.
---
That's how it was in Vanilla.
---
I want EVERYONE to need on the item, so it is fair who gets it, and who gets to benefit from it.
---
if it is a boe blue or purple and it is a group of randoms, everyone rolls need
---
Yeah they are massively helpful that's for sure. They do have limits, you can't do if/then statement type things for checking buffs/health/etc, only really things to do with the unit (target/player/focus/arena123 etc) - whether that's friendly, enemy, alive, dead, mouseover, existing or not existing and probably more. 
---
You can do stance macros of a similar config so if a Warrior was in Battle Stance you could have one switch to Defensive and Taunt for example, or a Druid to bear and Growl - that kinda thing, but again not checking debuffs/buffs/health etc.
---
If you've ever contacted *Blizzard* support, you know to expect more from them than *this*. They've always been above and beyond.
---
Wow nice your name is [[REDACTED]]? Nice find
---
I’ll kill you if I see you alliance scum.
---
Even worse when talking about coca cola
---
The answer is always Undead, best dance in the game, and really, it’s all about dancing on the corpses of your enemies.
---
Bite has a long cooldown. Claw doesn't. All things considered claw is simply better for damage, and even if you can have both they share global cooldown so claw is what you want if you care about max dps.
---
Until 7 days ago according to your post history, you didn't even know it existed. Ur all over the place bud
---
This is pretty good bait.
---
I’m not going to admit I’m wrong because I’m not wrong. I will block you though because you’re a dick and need to learn how to communicate with other humans.

Not really, no. But I bet you posted this thinking you'd make an actual point.

---
I'm assuming heal prediction isn't in the game right?
---
No, because at that point no one is getting 100g out of it. It's being equipped. 
---
If you want the item for monetary purposes, there is the option for Greed. If you need the item for equipping there is Need.  Simply concept. Not hard to understand.
---
&gt; confused about how the Need and Greed system works
---
Literally describing greed as a need.
---
I have a lvl 40 Shadow Priest and currently I'm focusing on the main spells I use.  Power Word: Fortitdue, Shield, Renew, Heal, Greater Heal, Flash heal, Shadow Word Pain, Mind Flay and Mind Blast.
---
I can heal fine in dungeons, I'm not as efficient as a Holy/Disc priest but healing really isn't that difficult.  I can also solo and kill mobs quite efficiently.
---
There are a lot of non-essential spells you don't need to heal or solo with so leave those for when you have your mount.

Che cazzo hai detto di me, puttanella? Ti dico una cosa, mi sono laureato tra i primi nella Marina Militare Italiana, è ho concluso con successo molte missioni segrete contro le brigate rosse, i neo-fascisti E la Mafia; ho piú di 300 uccisioni confermate. Mi sono graduato come esperto di Guerriglia e sono il miglior cecchino nell'interezza delle forze armate Italiane. Tu non sei niente per me, se non un altro bersaglio. Ti distruggeró con una precisione mai vista prima in questa terra, credimi. Pensi che tu possa parlare di me in questa maniera su internet? Pensaci di nuovo, stronzo. In questo momento sto contattando la mia rete segreta Statunitense e ti stanno tracciando l'indirizzo IP -- preparati per la tempesta, verme. La tempesta che finirá quella stupida piccola cosa che chiami "vita". Sei morto, ragazzino. Io potrei essere in qualsiasi luogo, in qualsiasi tempo, è posso ucciderti in piú di settecento modi, e questo è solamente con le mie mani. Non solo sono stato istruito in combattimento a mani nude, ho anche accesso all' intero arsenale delle Forze Armate Italiane e lo utilizzeró completamente per cancellare la tua miserabile esistenza da questo mondo, stronzetto. Se avessi saputo che inferno si sarebbe scatenato contro di te dopo quel tuo commento "Comico", forse non l'avresti detto. Ma lo hai fatto, ed adesso ne pagherai le conseguenze, fottuto idiota. Faró cadere merda su di te e ne annegherai. Sei fottutamente morto, bambinetto.
---
Can confirm, when SM raids were still a thing I got into groups by saying I'd pull better than a warlock, which is entirely true. My dps in terms of aoe is definitely worse than a warlocks but I can pull much larger packs w/ PW:S from priest and my pets sprint.
---
☺️

\*Feign this\* 
---
Hits a fat Rip for them to bleed to death.
---
NONONONONONONO NO!
---
Listen to the argument... It's not about your random 'a dime a dozen' boe green crappy item.... It's about those &lt;0,1% of the items in the database that for SOME REASON are worth 100g instead of 13s.
---
the 200g Staff of Jordan. or the 150g lvl 19 twink BiS Sword Or the lvl 50 Krol Blade that might be 500g at some point.
---
The JACKPOT items. The kind of items you will ONLY see drop once in your entire lifecycle as a character.
---
Those items, the general opinion is, are NEED for everybody in PuGs . Because they make SUCH a big difference.
---
NOTA BENE: In guilds or friend groups, this is different.. You can have your own social codes there, we are talking strangers here.
---
They already are.
---
And it doesn't change the fact repeating behavior should be called out. Maybe one generation we can stop looking back and look forward.
---
Not enough bag space.
---
I’ve found that if you’re on a quest for mobs that are humanoid, beasts, or anything that drops good drops is to just farm them for 2-3 hours. Especially if there’s just a couple quests in the zone and you know you’re gonna need to grind.  I’ve found myself grinding till my arrows are gone or inventory is full. Go back to closest banker and vendor/store stuff and go back. Shoot I’m almost revered with golgrim
---
Not untrue, if you set the rules before hand (Greed on BOE) and they rolled Need, its considered a scam.
---
Someone set up us the bomb!
---
If you are on the bleeding edge, it's better to craft early and take advantage of markets as they open. Being the best bag crafter around for example.
---
If you're late to the game, most of what you could make will likely be getting sold at or below mat cost because of other people leveling. The expense of leveling it just for those items doesn't become reasonable.
---
That said, if it makes you happy to make your own things, do it :)
---
Word. I'm going to get a DPS meter and analyze.
---
I have a weird technical question... sometimes, when I'm holding right-click and rotating the camera with my mouse, the camera will just suddenly decide to move about 3-4x as fast as normal for a second or two. It's super disorienting! Any tips?
---
Cosa cazzo hai appena detto su di me, puttanella? Sappi che mi sono diplomato come il migliore della mia classe alla scuola sottoufficiali della Marina Militare, ho preso parte in numerosi raid contro l’ISIS e ho più di 300 uccisioni confermate. Sono stato addestrato nelle tattiche di gorilla e sono il miglior cecchino dell’esercito italiano. Per me tu non sei altro che un nuovo bersaglio. Ti spazzerò via da questo pianeta con una precisione senza precedenti, ricordati le mie cazzo di parole. Pensi di potertela cavare a prendermi per il culo su Internet? Ripensaci in fretta, stronzo. Mentre parliamo io mi sto mettendo in contatto con la mia rete di spie infiltrate nella polizia postale per rintracciare il tuo indirizzo IP. Farai meglio a prepararti al peggio, merdaccia. Sta arrivando la tempesta che spazzerà via la sequenza di delusioni che è la tua vita. Sei fottutamente morto, bimbo. Posso essere ovunque, in qualunque momento e so più di 700 modi con cui ucciderti senza usare un’arma. Non sono solo addestrato al combattimento a mani nude, ho a mia disposizione l’intero arsenale dell’Esercito Italiano e non mi farò problemi a usarlo per far sparire la tua miserabile carcassa dalla faccia della terra, pezzo di merda. Se solo avessi potuto sapere le tragiche conseguenze che il tuo commentino tanto “intelligente” ti avrebbe portato forse ti saresti morso la lingua. Ma non potevi sapere e non l’hai fatto, e adesso ne pagherai le conseguenze, fottuto idiota. Cagherò ira sopra di te fino a farti annegare. Sei fottutissimamente morto, bimbo.
---
my low rogue can barely fight 2 without evasion
---
While leveling I’ve been trying to time my drinks with spirit tap and often I’m out of the fsr because I’ll finish the mob off with my wand. Still struggle with mana sometimes, but I’m sure better gear and more talents will alleviate that.
---
My only question is,  how the hell do you have 180g?
---
Im level 46 and only have 53g and no mount yet.   Been so broke and cant seem to get ahead :(
---
Chaotic evil
---
I had no idea that was even an option. That could actually sway me!
---
Nope. But some addons do give this tool. I use Pearl Unit Frames
---
What text / UI mod is that? Looking to install it later today
---
Lvl 20 Prot Warrior
---
Feels like I'm leveling pretty slow, common for warriors, I know. But I cant handle any mobs over 2, even if they are lvl14. Tips? Really tired of running back to my body lol
---
In case it isn't clear, my friend went afk right here and drowned while he was gone because he is a gnome.
---
And water lol
---
Maybe I'm wrong but the Pandaren content seems really weighted towards herbalism.  I found myself gaining a lot of XP (often 2x the XP) by smelling the flowers than I did with same-level mobs.  There were usually 2-3 flower spots on the minimap at any given time and they respawned quickly.  I think it's cool that gathering professions give XP.
---
I didn't choose herbalism in classic because I just wasn't seeing very many herbs.
---
I had tailoring and enchanting and still got my mount at 40.
---
Just have to be smart with your money along the way, you don't really have to go out of your way.
---
I never said you said anything, but that's definitely what you suggested with "in classic people don't leave SM for 24 levels." (??) maybe I'm wrong though, you didn't make any real point clearly
---
Then pulls another mob that itself runs and dies on the exact edge of another's aggro radius...
---
And, companies underperform expectations.
---
As for the Baron Mount:
---
- Yes, that is what I would advise. It’s the biggest benefit to the group. However, I don’t think you have solid justification for saying that doing something noble like that isn’t the right thing to do simply because some people will choose not to. 
---
The line drawn between very rare items is not arbitrary, it’s based off of benefit.
---
Here’s some examples:
---
- The warden staff is the best Druid tank mitigation weapon in the game. It won’t be replaced and if someone takes that to sell over giving it to the Druid in the party there is no possible way that it will benefit the group more.
---
- Edgemaster’s gauntlets are another instance of a limited availability item that will last several phases/months/possibly years. Taking these away from a warrior would be similarly detrimental, with less benefit gained from selling it.
---
- Going back to your deathcharger example, the mount can be easily replaced in terms of function (unlike some other epic world drops) since anyone can grind gold for a mount as a guarantee if they have enough time. Since it is purely cosmetic, I would certainly consider priority on that item to go towards someone who can draw functional benefit from it quickly. If someone who already has a 100% mount takes it, it provides no functional benefit. 
---
I hope this at least clarifies my thinking.
---
Is fury warrior good at farming?
---
basically monitor a crash landing site
---
ahh okay gotcha
---
You have to use Mana to trigger the 5 seconds. So if you cast a spell that costs no Mana (such as by the talent in the disc? tree) it also doesn't trigger it
---
Sorry misremembered.
---
You are right, those are the only scenarios where they act.
---
My bad, I removed my comment.
---
Read through the comments on wowhead. I have seen quite a few quests where my add one day one thing and sources on wowhead say otherwise. Sometimes it’s in the comments not the actual wowhead page.
---
I’d be fine with it if flying mounts were just as hard if not harder to obtain than epic mounts
---
Yep, it starts slow but really picks up the further in shadow you go.
---
Wow that UI is some literal eye cancer. Sorry but, why so much black showing on the unitframes? Why are your actionsbars so big? You have them keybinded you should know what to click without it taking up that much space ;-;
---
If you don't think that dungeon blue is advantageous to the people who can wear it, then your belief it has economic advantage is moot.  You can't play both sides of the coin for the sake of arguing for greed and ultimately deny its viability and worth.
---
Makes more sense, even if it was .01 cents per sub that would still amount to 100 000$.
---
i just bought my rod for 70s because the markets flooded
---
Hm maybe I'll use that instead of grid for raid frames. Thanks
---
If everyone in the group can and will equip it, sure. Everyone needs on it. 
---
If you're going to sell it, you greed on it. 
---
Unfortunately its come down to most groups having everyone roll need on it to prevent people from Ninjaing it.
---
This isn’t spreading negativity. It’s only negative if you’re stubborn. All of the points I made in this post are correct. The negativity comes from other people’s reaction to being presented factual information. 
---
If anything should be ruining your fun, it’s the comments on this post, not the post itself.
---
That place is camped 24 hours a day on my server.  If someone else has grabbed it there is a respawn timer.  I spent 90 minutes waiting for my last piece to spawn last night.
---
blizzard cant crit
---
My main issue I have found is once in a while when I am autoshotting, it will just stop auto shotting for no reason. I have to reclick the auto shot key. 
---
Also, I am not targeting anything else or even moving. Definitely not how its supposed to be.
---
5th party member will be called a Ninja, gets a bad rep on that realm and it will follow him, if it gets bad enough no one will group with him and it can even affect the guild's rep ... there is nothing new there it happens but that its fairly rare
---
I'm confused what you're trying to get, it has enemy options in there.
---
Good stuff. 
---
I just did my first run since probably vanilla and a few people in my group forgot about him and jumped down without looking. aggro'd the whole backside of the boat haha. Some people ran out the back of the instance so we just decided to call it since you can't get back in that way.
---
I'm comin for him next time tho
---
No one made you sto that quest. You're complicit.
---
You're 100% wrong. 
---
You're blocking me because you can't deal with that fact.
---
Look for a dirt pile. It moves.
---
Personally I would go Orc.
---
The two races are essentially equal in PVP (regardless of whether you premade or not), you could make an argument for either one.
---
Orc, however, is the best race for PVE on horde side (troll, technically, but if you plan to do PVP at all then you'd wanna roll orc).
---
Works for me.
---
Game gives you some significant consequence for dying, forces you to learn how to use your skills properly and also evade, things that will help you in pvp and later pve content.
---
This sorta happened to me, a random guildie that I've never met / talked to before randomly sent me this badass priest ring for my level 25 priest for free. Just logged in to find it in my mailbox. So far my experience in classic has been that most people are super generous and nice. It gives me hope in humanity
---
If they're healing then absolutely. I just get a bit tangy when *I'm* healing as a priest and a dps druid or paladin takes my caster cloth. It sucks competing against even more people for it when for a long time there's already a mage/warlock or two that are also rolling for it.
---
Go to camera settings and turn off smart pivot, that snaps the camera back for you.
---
knowing my luck once it switched to dustwallow it would plop me in the water and id have to spend the next 5 minutes swimming
---
Bloodthirst does damage based on attack power, and so is independent of your weapons.
---
Ahh, the good 'ol Hurricane...
---
I rolled a need on the drop
---
Hunter Loot I needed to pop
---
I equipped it as soon as I won
---
Gonna Biznicks the shit out of this one...
---
I'd trade my own soulshard for a Harpy Quiver
---
But I can't since AV isn't here...
---
I wasn't farming for this
---
But now you're in my ranged...
---
Your rate of fire was holdin
---
Epic purple, my 'leet was showin'
---
Local LFM-DPS was crowin'
---
I know where I'm going baby!
---
Hey, I just got you and this is crazy
---
But here's my arrows, so save some maybe
---
It's hard to bring enough ammo baby
---
Hey I just got you and this is crazy
---
And all the other vendors try to chase me
---
No changes
---
I have zero interest in spamming SM for 10+ levels. More power to those that do but that just sounds so utterly unappealing to me.
---
Gnomer has a similar issue with arches.  The big packs around the planes on the way to boss #2 can't path under the arches, nor can you charge through them, so if ranged pull aggro they run all the way around.
---
omfg. Im stupid...
---
Haha thanks!
---
I did this on launch day but keybinds were fucked so I pressed arrow keys to zoom out to take a screenshot but I backpedaled off the boat, falling into the abyss
---
Check up around where sarltooth is, there are 1 or two spawn points up there that are easy to miss.
---
Is this on Herod?
---
Down with the thiccness
---
Thanks my dude.
---
Lol. It's friendly banter tbh. In a way I do hope to see you around, fellow Rattlegore brother.
---
These are the type of things retail will never give us.  Wow classic allows us to bring back our smaller communities where people actually remember you. I love it already!
---
They don't have static spawn points. It's not a big mate. 2 days? Jesus... Good luck lol
---
Just kill me. It’s easier.
---
That was me when a Druid and rogue that were level 24 tried to kill me when I was fishing. (Had a succubus out too)
---
Guerilla
---
TIL the LFG addon. Which I will now install.
---
What a fucking guy
---
I've been running into a few people who roll need on everything and don't understand why it's rude. A couple people seemed very apologetic about it and stopped which just confused more
---
I have fun regardless of what any of you say or do. Just trying to help people understand the words they use.
---
Everybody sucks here
---
I used PP religiously while leveling to 35(80% of the xp was from dungeons) and I made maybe 8-9g total from it. I had 130g when I hit 40 so it didn't make much of a difference except that my lockpicking was quite good
---
Ya, they'd have to do them for every class at once or it would feel bad. Which would be possible I think if they didn't rework classes, add a bunch of new zones and leveling quests, and re itemize everything with every xpac. But it is what it is.
---
Exactly! I was look at 1.12 as 1.1.2. Apparently I see what I want to....
---
&gt;Someone tell me I'm retarded please haha
---
Well, I'm not gonna go that far, but your counting skills could use some work.
---
Let the music take control. Let the rhythm move you.
---
The problem with a vote system is that eventually, people will vote for things that are in their own interest, rather than the game's best interest.
---
In OSRS, the game with the vote system, there is a dynamic between Skillers and Bossers. Both of these communities have had proposals for content they enjoy voted down. This has caused an issue where, if content that Skillers enjoy is being proposed, Bossers will vote it down and vice versa. We've seen this recently with the Warding skill. Jagex put a lot of development time into this skill, only to have the community vote it down. 
---
Imagine Blizzard developing a new raid and having it voted down, because players that don't even raid voted NO on new raid content, simply because they don't like development hours being spent on content they won't participate in. This is the issue that OSRS has been suffering from.
---
Woo asscandy! I've had no trouble finding groups any hour of the day and haven't once seen a queue. Life is good.
---
I’m with it. It is a PvP server, anywho. Good luck!
---
I personally enjoy leveling craft professions as I go. I've tried the mining/skinning route, and while it does help you keep up with costs, there's a certain magic that is lost with it. My warriors are always satisfying to level because I do mining/smithing alongside them. I'm able to make myself good armor and weapons, and the sharpening stones and skeleton keys are very handy to have on me. Whenever I'm bored of questing or need to free up some precious bank space, I head off to the city to spend some time on my craft.
---
It really is just a matter of your own patience. 
---
The downside to doing them at 60 is having to knock it all out at once. It just doesn't have that same appeal as finding things as you go - especially since the game is balanced to give you the next tier of resources as you climb to higher zones. Lets say you're excited to start making mithril gear, but haven't come across any ore just yet. It's a thrill the moment you hit that zone that begins to spawn it. It adds so much more weight to the experience.
---
I'm 100% for it.
---
My Druid is the first character that I'll be doing a bit different. For [Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811), I'm going with Enchanting. My other profession is going to be Herbalism. This will let me enchant my own gear, maybe even make some cash on the side, while still peddling herbs on the AH. If/when I get the Heart, I may decide to drop Enchanting and take Alchemy instead, in which case I'll have a nice stockpile of herbs to work with. Some people will argue that I'm wasting my time by not then taking Mining/Engineering (PvP server), and from an optimization point of view, they're right. But I didn't roll a protector of nature to dig into the earth and craft gadgets. That's weird.
---
It being equipped is still you getting 100g out of it. It's 100g you didn't spend at the AH.
---
Me selling it on the AH isn't taking it away from you because you can obtain it at any point at the AH.
---
I have a bad history of altitis..I’m level 30 now and I keep itching but I don’t want to repeat my old ways of never getting past the mid 30s lol
---
I know, am so lazy to type them out.
---
I even had the /moo macro on a hotkey at one stage.
---
The one right at the bottom is an "/em spits on you" emote, some people are so fragile.

That's an assumption, not an agreement. Huge difference bro.

Yes the addon has many customization options.

I used to love making people jump off the cliff of lumber mill in AB.
---
&gt;First, that, if we are to talk about joy, equilibrium is a must.

Absolutely. I've come around to Aristotle's take on it. Virtues and vices are expressions of the same things, with virtues being in moderation and vices in the extremes.
---
So I wouldn't consider myself obsessed with being ripped. I just want to be stronger, so that I can better take care of myself and others. Grooming the beard isn't really an option since it just isn't full enough (so I shave). And yeah, I'm working on my posture right now actually. Ordered a foam roller today.
---
I have very simple needs and pretty clear ideas of what I want from life. But like a lot of people I just struggle to find and maintain the motivation or discipline to accomplish everything I want.
---
&gt;For many people that is failing at life. If that is failing, I wish to continue failing for 40 years or more lol
---
Hear hear! I'm not a lover of frivolous excesses. I won't get any use out of a lambo. It's fast, but I don't need a fast car. I don't want to be noticed or the center of attention. I want what I need to live in relative comfort and the time to be creative. I desire a fairly ascetic life, all things considered. If that's failure, I'm down with it.
---
I think ur title is wrong.
---
Engi goggles master race. Too bad it's not tbc where they're actually good.
---
No, it’s not. There’s no guarantee that the item will be available, but gold can always be obtained as a guarantee.
---
The other problem with weighting the selling value of an item over directly equipping the item is that the selling value is hard to determine because it fluctuates so much. If we judge the worth of an upgrade by the functional benefit it provides and how quickly it benefits the group, then selling an item introduces a high level of uncertainty. You don’t know how long it will take to sell the item, you don’t know what the equivalent functional benefit will be from what you buy because you don’t know what the item will sell for exactly, and for those reasons I can’t in good conscience recommend selling an item over giving to the person in the group that can readily use the upgrade.
---
This dude came out of nowhere critizing his decision to play a class and race in a video game. A little sarcasm is better then him calling the guy an outright prick.

Time to lay some pipe in Mulgore if you know what I mean.

You're on a pvp server and got corpse camped didn't you? 😂

Good luck bro
---
I would roll need on an epic boe if its an upgrade. Its none of your business why i roll need.

However. If you roll need and it isnt an upgrade i wont be above voting you out of the group.

soloing in modern wow: Only 3 mobs this pull? Sigh. Better save my cooldowns then.

When you find her you see her name is “Beaten “Corpse”, but most don’t know that her name was just “Corpse” before she met him.

I don’t know why you’re ignoring what he’s saying. 
---
Retail WoW is easier than classic in every way but one (mythic raiding). There is one aspect of the entire game that is more “difficult”. 
---
Classic is harder [b]overall[\b]
---
Don't worry, friend, I just got mine at 42! The Tigers/Coyotes in Badlands make for great farming for grey items to get you up to your mount, and if you're a skinner you'll make some serious bank!
---
Being an Undead I have a feeling he won't be as hospitable..
---
I’m sorry it affects your immersion.  Would you prefer to queue for two days?
---
Grey trash at lvl 45 is a gold from a vendor
---
No, if you need, you equip on site. If you greed, you can do whatever.
---
Doesn't matter how rare the item is, same rules apply. That staff of Jordan is 500g because it's amazing and people want to use it. Let a character who will put it to use have it. It was their lucky day.
---
Lol someone should write a short novel and sell the pages on the ah
---
Gnomish mind controller helmet was my jam because of this and AB
---
I know right? When I saw that again after all these years it was just a total "whoah" moment.
---
How time flies.
---
No. Level 1 frostbolt is only used as a slow for kiting purposes
---
I'm doing my part!
---
Petty little jackhole had to downvote my comment just for good measure. Some people shouldn't have internet access.
---
I was thinking Night elf warrior. Lot of people consider that the worst warrior combo
---
Oh OK, I learned something I guess.
---
And just as often, they don't.
---
Transfers off of high population servers happened throughout Vanilla. It's been one of Blizzard's population controls for a long time.
---
FFF is just such a game changer too.  Large ranged threat is dope.
---
Do I need to babysit you every time a item drops. Make sure you click the right button?
---
I think P2 around christmas is somewhat realistic. Gives people plenty of time to level up and get MC/Ony down and such, then after that probably a faster release schedule since the leveling won't be such a giant part of the time sink.
---
Look at me!  I am the anchor now.
---
Hmm doesn't put the name over mobs for me.  Says enemy players so I assume it does PvP but I'm looking at PvE, should have specified.
---
You do know character migration, free and paid, we're available in vanilla originally?
---
It only has value if has utility and you're essentially saying it has no utility because they're worthless as an upgrade. You can't double standard like that.
---
They have MORE value to those who can wear it because it increases their utlity/performance.
---
Without that value, then it has NO value in the Auction house - otherwise NO ONE WOULD BUY IT.
---
This is a very very odd infographic. A bit hard to follow honestly.
---
We had "instances and on top of that character mitigation" in vanilla.  What the fuck do you guys source your memory from?
---
And a tomato is technically a fruit but if you go around correcting everyone at the grocery store you’re just being a nuisance.
---
There's an Austrian bistro near us that has signs on the tables that say, "Here, bacon is an herb." Maybe it's just culture :)
---
Jesus dude lmao
---
Badlands tigers/Coyotes is a good farm spot, too.
---
the lengths these narcisstic little shits are willing to go doing mental gymnastics in order to justify item theft is unbelievable.
---
equip = need | everything else = greed. period
---
I'm a healbot kinda guy too.   For dungeons you can use healium, not the best but will get you thru it until healbot works.   I don't want to go back to the days  of high lighting ( or F1-....) players in a large raid.
---
It doesn't do enemy mobs, might do PvP players but I meant PvE, I should have specified.
---
I think earlier.
---
I said:
---
&gt;They have factories there sometimes employing over 100k people for this very purpose.
---
So yeah, there are factories in China who employ hundreds of thousands of people to farm gold. 
---
"It is estimated that 80% of all gold farmers are in China and with the largest internet population in the world there are thought to be 100,000 full-time gold farmers in the country."
---
and that's just full-time lol
---
Did it's WoW is a common joke about night elf rogues. Maybe you should have rolled dwarf r thicker skin 😂😂😂

---
To answer your question about reckoning, it does not work like it had in private servers.
---
There are wonky ways to get it working but it's definitely not a viable spec in Classic as many thought (including me).
---
Bigger reach than me fantastic
---
Eh, I think they'll talk about it at Blizzcon cause why not, then release it just as school is going into winter break if they're smart about it. People massively underestimate just how long the vast majority of players take to hit 60, much less actually do the raids and such. I think 3 months is a pretty realistic spot.
---
It was after I remembered to boot up the app at 3pm. People taking this much too seriously; it's literally flaired as humour.
---
I cant imagine being someone who cares so much about imaginary internet points that you try to rip off one of the most popular reddit stories of all time to get karma on a classic wow sub.
---
No need for smite you wand will be enough
---
Season 1 legion elite shaman tho...
---
That’s fair just wanted to play the pvp but I won’t put in 5+ days to do so
---
if you want a farming alt, you should go hunter or rogue. shaman is fun and i did't have trouble "farming" with mine as elemental spec but i would pick the first two i mentioned over shaman if my sole purpose was to farm.
---
Remind me in 4 hours
---
Okay, go forsaken. Undead rogues are cool as hell.
---
I dunno man, I'm personally not a fan of it but Shadowmeld is so fun in PvP as a Warrior.
---
/r/UnexpectedAITA
---
I'm probably never playing Classic because of this. Can't stand playing a game where people can abuse things such as this. Puts people on an uneven playing field because Blizzard is too ignorant to keep Classic as it was.
---
Ranged weapon only matters for the stats they provide not for their damage or speed.
---
Defensive stance 
---
There are cast bar addons 
---
Upgrade to plate when the gear is worth it, it's just more armor.
---
Are you allowed to use the internet without your parents in the room? Do they know you're here?
---
Offering limited time transfering from certain overloaded servers to ease populations and improve the quality of life for everyone... means were on the path to retail wow? What's that logic
---
And what if ghosts can fight other ghosts
---
So you can camp the mobs so that they never respawn but also only if you are dead
---
Eternal griefing
---
A lot of people wouldn't move from their medium server to a server with a 2 hour queue. Having 'home' servers felt natural back then, things were just like that, a server was a main way of meeting gaming friends, but now with things like social media, twitch, etc, it's one thing I wouldn't mind them changing. Just make it similar to runescape, you can log into any server any time.
---
I bet that comment made you feel so superior
---
yeah as OP said I was speaking more towards orc vs undead, not sure how human would be more optimal than Orc though. Getting rid of blind is nice, resisting Kidney also pretty nice haha
---
Spell cast.  You can fish for it with rank 1 SWP casts, but it will never proc off the continuing damage, or off mind flay's non-first tick for example
---
Random greens at level 35.  
---
Who would have thought?
---
I’ve seen a similar effect in just introducing my wife to the game.
---
Before December is my bet. So 2 months- 3 max from release.
---
Use battleshout more
---
Can confirm it works. I was giving fort to Horde in STV last night. It breaks the MC immediately after and obviously it won't work if a more powerful buff is already on the target.
---
from what old and well known wow players, said that there was paid character migration, and that kept the population fairly stable.
---
It's pretty much a guarantee the item will be available man. These servers are huge. Magnitudes larger than high pop vanilla realms and I never had difficulty finding a world drop back then on the AH within a week.
---
No, that isn't what you said earlier. I'm not sure why you feel compelled to justify your invalid arguments. Just shut up and move on.
---
mmmkkay
---
Shut it!
---
Dazed and Confused for days with daisys starring Patrick Dwayze...
---
You can tank using an Arms build while in defensive stance, just spam battle shout a lot. It generates aoe threat for each party member buffed by it. 
---
Also for ranged just pick what has the best stats
---
Same here!  It took a while to get used to but I couldn't play without it now.  I need to see if there is a Naga Addon for Classic.
---
If someone intends to wear it they are more than welcome to purchase it off the AH.

You spent your DKP on vendorstrike?!

The extremely important phrase in your post here is "if you set the rules before hand", and i fully agree with you. I'd even agree to those rules and abide by them if that's what the group wanted to do. I've never seen anyone try to negotiate rules like that before an item dropped though, and the fact is, even most people who can equip a boe rare don't, because they value the money more. In the absence of any agreement in a pug, just roll need and don't worry about it.
---
&gt; it was downright impossible
---
Yeah, that's how my Demon Hunter felt in Classic too.
---
I have mostly had good experiences of people asking for food/water or buffs. I had a guy last night asking to buy some water off me. I just told him to find me and I would give it to him for free, I don't think I could ever charge for something I make for free lol. Even still when I gave them the water they tipped me which was a simple nice gesture.
---
I found 5 swiftness potions and 3 healing potions in my mail for free.
---
I couldn't even thank the sender, because he was portuguese and had a weird name with é or è or ç and clicked the mail away before I realized I has not memorized these weird letters and now I can't type his name.
---
Print screen by itself saves a file in world of Warcraft
---
That makes sense but I meant this mostly in the context of pvp it’s a hard think to handle and there is no clear option
---
At least on Herod there are a lot of people in SW standing around and at the AH. I'd bet that if you searched stormwind even during nonpeak hours you'd get more hits than that.
---
On spell cast of shadow spell IIRC. Spamming SW:P for example could trigger it before the first dot tick
---
I would check the zperl options. There are quite a few.
---
Layering
---
Bears can easily outthreat a warrior on single target. A maul every 1.2 seconds or so with MCP is redonkulus threat.
---
There are several exceptions to that rule, but all anyone has to do is tell the group at the beginning of their intentions. When you're paladin or druid trying to get gear to raid you're likely going to look for some cloth items. Before I got T1 on my paladin in vanilla I had maybe 3 plate items because there isn't a lot of plate of healers.
---
Lmao did you roll pvp because you wanted to run people off boats? I rolled pvp to fight other players not waste my time jerking off while MC people off boats. How pathetic are you? I bet you camp low levels too.
---
And then the Ninja does a free realm transfer.
---
Selling items is not an upgrade.
---
I *loathe* the horrible bloated Twitch app (and twitch in general), but it's by far the easiest way to install add-ons, and more importantly keep them updated (which is nearly daily right now since authors are busy fixing bugs).
---
I once had a random tank that went full on verbal assault because the *almost* died during a boss fight. We didn't even wipe once.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/heal-bot-continued
---
I agree there
---
Since the meta has shifted towards  fury/prot warriors dual wielding, the crit and crush argument holds no weight to it. Healers don't need to worry as much about Mana when the fights don't last as long.

---
I can confirm that Classic WoW is super lightweight in terms of data usage.
---
My ISP is lazy as a Peon, so I have been forced to use 4G in order to play. I don't have a huge data package, so since I don't have regular internet at the moment, I had spent it all before classic launched. Instead of charging me by the megabyte, my phone company slows my 4G down to 64 kbps. As long as I'm running WoW and nothing else, my ping is about 80 ms. 
---
If someone calls me, or if I opens any apps that requires data, my connection dies... I just consider that to be part of the #nochanges nostalgia
---
Good BoPs represent a pile of money. It's money gained by selling it.

Everyone needs money, so everyone needs.

---
When incoming heals show up on the health bar. Eg if I were to start casting heal on someone with 10% health, their health bar would show the 10% + the amount that heal will give, typically in a different shade
---
__laughs in rogue__
---
Ranged weapon doesn't matter, speed might help but it's hardly noticeable. Once you get ranged weapons with stats it's more interesting to pick. I use a crossbow I picked up at like level 15. Does the job!
---
Thunderclap isn't a good threat generator. Battle shout and demo are both better- battle shout is kind of a small AoE taunt. Usually I start with battle stance and charge in and then swap to defensive (macro that swaps to sword/shield, same for battle stance and 2 hander).
---
Sounds like the mage or warlock isnt focusing right. Maybe the lock is dotting everything up before you can get threat on it. If you notice this happen early on in a dungeon, start marking mobs skull and X and you can build up threat on them better before the mages/locks go ham.
---
Get the addon ClassicCastbars and keep name plates up, you'll see the spell names on them when they cast. Really great to help interrupt heals and dangerous casts.
---
Plate is more expensive and not definitely better around level 40. Lots of blue mail will still be better than a green plate item. Just upgrade as you get better stats. Armor is important, but when tanking your shield is a huge boost so the difference between mail/plate comes down to the secondary stats more.
---
The mage can get it by buying it on the AH.
---
My first character was a Tauren Warrior I leveled to 10, then a human mage I leveled to 20, Then I rolled my main, a Dwarf Paladin.
---
Actually layer hopping makes leveling much faster.
---
I forgot about the Stun Resist... Yeah very hard choice :P
---
Doesn't the paladin quest send them to SFK, not BFD?
---
Well then don’t die 🤷‍♂️

What the fuck? Not at all... are your eyes okay?

Only hard time I have on my warlock is cultists that are fear immune.

---
They should be but we won't know for certain until dm comes out.
---
The only reason it didn't work on some private servers is because they specifically went out of their way to nerf the farm as it was too efficient of a gold farming technique that was also gauranteed (instanced farm so no possibility of ganking, and you don't ah anything so no fluctuation or flooding the market dropping the price)
---
And pandaria
---
Rogue was my original main so I’m staying away from that, and hunter was my first and only alt in vanilla so I’m staying away from that as well. Wanted something with a bit more utility in groups.
---
Haven’t seen that once
---
Nope, Just because you keep repeating it doesn't mean its true.
---
The person who can use it has the same gold value + utility. That is not the same value as you just having just gold.  There is no such thing as what you suggest.   You're just assuming someone should buy things and not play the game or that the only reason they play the game is to sell things.  That is not true either.
---
Chinese culture is a culture centered around cheating and nothing will be done about it because they bring in the big bucks for games. Practices that are hated among western gamers are common practice in Asia.

Can horde not receive this axe? I’ve ran armory 15 times now with no ravenger drop, never seen it once.
---
I have been doing this too. Whenever I am crafting stuff for skill ups, I send a good chunk of it to random characters that are at or one level to low for things. I call it a care package, welcome them to the server, and wish them happy questing.
---
I change the greeting every batch because I'm not tracking who I'm sending stuff too, so someone may randomly get duplicate messages.
---
I’ve gotta assume all the PS are dead now haha which is fine but ya I understand
---
quality level smackdowns like this don't happen often, but when they do...
---
And then there's me over here torn between ghost saber, Humar, Broken Tooth, The Rake, and my old 'legacy' pet - a boring ol' nightsaber stalker. I love me some cats, clearly (although I wouldn't turn down a really neat wind serpent... Son of Hakkar looks pretty badass).
---
There is still no point in not just using [exists]. [harm] is good, but usually you would pair it with [help] so your macro does something else for friendly targets.
---
Your macro works, I guess, I just don't see the reason for avoiding [exists].
---
So even if I got it to work I would still get the unable to start 3d acceleration error?
---
Dungeons are a pretty unique experience, because they're all of a certain higher difficulty where it requires a team with some kind of synergy. It's where your class gets to shine in its role. Dungeons are also incredibly rewarding in terms of loot.
---
However, if you're new, you probably don't have a firm grasp on how to best utilize your role, or maybe even what others would expect from you. Dungeons are long experiences and can get tiring and difficult, especially without proper preparation. They have a range of complexity. And, finally, being dragged through it without any interaction is kind of contrary to an MMO.
---
Best I could say is, if you go with those friends again, ask them to explain more of things as you go. Check out a couple vids on YouTube about your class and how it works in a group. As you play in general you'll get a better grip on things, and maybe feel the intensity of dungeons in a positive and intriguing way.
---
FFs man now I'mma have to make a druid.
---
Like what?
---
5 day weekend thanks to Dorian was seriously amazing.
---
It costs rage, requires the enemy to dodge your attack, and can miss.
---
It usually takes about 10 hours to get to 20 in classic, maybe 15 if you're slow so I mean it's still a big difference but you where also just super slow.
---
You can learn screech from the level 17+ buzzards in westfall. While you’re there you can learn claw 3 from the sea crabs (I -think- lvl 17 too).
---
Petopia for classic is your best resource here.
---
What quest is this
---
Imagine trying to hide from MC only to be tamed by a hunter and forced to be their pet
---
You have useful keybinds aplenty, USE THEM, DON'T WASTE THEM.
---
Bind A and D to strafe left and right, respectively. All keys withing EASY **AND** COMFORTABLE reach of your left hand should be abilities.
---
I personally use F1 - F4, Alt+1 - 4, Shift+1 - 4, 1-6, Q, E, R, Shift+Q, Shift+E, Shift+R, T, Z, X, V, ` for binds, along with /, *, -, 7, 8, 9 on my numpad bound to an MMO mouse.
---
I also have Scroll up and Scroll down bound to pet attack and follow (warlock/hunter stuff). CTRL+Scroll up/down can be used for camera zoom, you don't have to zoom THAT often.
---
The **ENTIRE** point of these binds is I never have to move my left hand, so I can always move AND use abilities freely while using my right hand for camera movement, abilities, and targeting.
---
You're the only person who doesnt get it, lmao.
---
So nice to see guild adverts that have even a shred of personality in them. So many of them are drier then real white collar job postings.

Try this
---
/run SetCVar("UnitNameHostleNPC", 1)
---
Him as well as you are a rogue, you should know we only have 7 buttons
---
&gt;If it's something you could buy on the AH then you needing it to equip instead of paying for it is also just you being greedy.
---
This makes no sense. What is the point of running dungeons, i.e., putting in the work and effort if you can be rewarded with an upgarde. Stop being a ninja looter.
---
    /petattack
---
    /castsequence reset=4,target Corruption, Curse of Agony, Immolate
---
This will cast Corruption, then CoA, then Immolate -- and then back to Corruption.
---
It will reset the sequence back at the start (Corruption) after 4 seconds of not pressing the macro. You can play with this number to see when you usually need it to reset.
---
It will also reset the sequence at the beginning if you switch targets.
---
Shit, I went from bottom rung to top of the pyramid at the outset of BC, feral druid was the most op class ever. Top damage as a tank in every dungeon, it was incredible.
---
If it's bothering you so much just stop trying to have the last word every time lol. You care way too much about me buddy.
---
Yeah alt is great for me as a rogue.
---
I didn’t mention it because of the healers and self heal.
---
It's more like without any addons, I have to either click a party member's frame or press a key to target the party member. Then I press my combination of hotkeys to cast the spell I wanted.
---
With something like clique or healbot, I have the combination of keys be mouse clicks + modifiers and then I just mouseover and shift left click/right click or alt left click/right click. You could do the same thing with mouseover macros and binds but I find this to be less effort.
---

Damn, I am unable to play until the 10th.

---
Go Undead, WOTF is not overrated and is a great racial. Basically allows you to be the greatest counter to warlocks and gives you better chance at priests.
---
Undead is also smaller model which I feel is a small advantage in PvP.
---
And they are the coolest race in the game and definitely the most "rogueish".
---
Like 0% of items you sell for under vendor price are getting to the people you want them to get to. People scan the AH constantly for items that they can just vendor, I bet they usually sell in just minutes of you putting them up. I would sell them for 1c over vendor price if you really just want to help people out. No snipers will buy them over vendor price unless they think they can resell on AH for more.
---
make it a drinking game. :)
---
???
---
You write you have the option checked, but it's unchecked. Just click NPC names.
---
In retail you can choose, and you have it set to "Show enemies and quest NPC names". In 1.13 you can't pick and choose, all NPC names or none.

Oh you create content huh? This is not going to end well for you
---
This actually was one of my more memorable stories so far from Classic on a PvP server.  
---
So it was me (level 24 Human Warlock) and a 40ish Dwarf Shadow Priest who boarded the boat with multiple Horde, including a 32 Orc Rogue who was already flagged.  The moment the boat started taking off the Dwarf Priest MC'd the Rogue off the boat.  An Undead Priest who was ?? to me MC'd the Dwarf off.  
---
Realizing I was like that kid from the Simpsons in the bus meme, I ran underneath the stairs and hid there to block Line of Sight.  The Undead Level ??? Priest hopped down and looked at me for a moment, and the standoff began.
---
He started off by trying to cast what I knew had to have been Mind Control, so in a panic I cast Fear.  It managed to successfully go off and he of course started running around spastically for a few seconds.  He was not pleased with this and tried to get LoS on me again, only for me to have Fear at the ready to where he had to give up on his initial plan.
---
The boat loaded into STV at this point so I he already failed to get me stuck in Horde waters.  Taking his failure gracefully, he threw SW Pain on me and I think Vampiric Touch? then Psychic Screamed me so I ended up running off of the boat shortly before it could arrive at Booty Bay.
---
Joke's on him though because I had a health stone + lesser healing potion and managed to heal up before his DoTs fully killed me.  So I swam over to the dock, hopped ashore, and it was I who got to have the last /laugh.
---

I found out that the skinning knife actually does decent dps (2.2) for starting out.
---
Recent as of Jan 2018, so over a year and a half, and an entire expansion ago. It was changed *precisely because of complaints like yours*, so this narrative that expansions have ruined the game because of things like this is just plain false.
---
Let's not pretend your complaint isn't also a serious problem in Classic as well - you can and will frequently still level up faster than most professions level without extreme diligence, leaving you in a position of having to also waste time farming materials from stuff that offers no experience, making professions a massive bore. Literally the only game version this doesn't happen is on retail (and even then, it's possible, just heavily mitigated).
---
&gt;  Just because I don't actively play something doesn't mean I can't criticize it. 
---
No, but you should probably know what you're talking about so that your criticism is taken seriously. Just a thought.
---
At least that makes some sense. Sure it's 15 spirit, but it's also 5 int. Spirit isn't a completely dead stat for the Warlock. I had that happen with me 3 times with Robes of Arugal, but I always asked if they're down to run again, and move on. Now if a feral druid or enhancement shaman did that too me. Oooooooo I'd be livid.
---
So my server is meant to be a near enough 50/50 split on horde and alliance, but every zone I've been in (including heavily alliance orientated zones) there is around 15 horde to 1 alliance roaming around questing, I wish wish WISH this was an exaggeration, so that's got me thinking, are all the alliance layering to one layer? and the horde doing the same? can that even happen? I went through stranglethorn from duskwood to booty bay and it's a given you'll see more horde due to ratchet boat and the fp horde have up north, but i counted 34 unique horde and 2 unique alliance, gotta be something up right? or is it just coincidence?
---
It’s ok to like both versions of the game. Don’t see why it has to be a big deal. Nazjatar was so cool.
---
It’s the exact same amount of clicks, it’s just a different timing of when your click.
---
God that guy killed me often in 2007, cant wait to meet him again !
---
Utility value is only there if you can wear it, which is why those who wear it should need and those who just sell it greed. It's the very definition thereof.
---
Not. Rocket. Science.
---
If you *agree* to need everything who gives a crap what you roll.
---
WC sorry...... LFG WC Heal/ Tank!
---
dont forget people legit spent vacation time to get off work and play WoW classic for the first week.  at least 5 people in my last guild did.
---
Naw I don't watch his streams
---
I hate how players only try to fight me when I’m in the middle of fighting a mob of NPCs. Zero honor.
---
Ah, thanks for the explanation.
---
Keep in mind that you can definitely spec into Shadow while leveling and still heal dungeons successfully. I always keep my group alive while putting out some decent DPS at the same time.
---
Yeah I've definitely been slacking. I think I've only done it like 10 times and I'm level 30 lol
---
This is beyond science...
---
&gt;mess around with the reset amount if you find yourself finishing the sequence before 3 seconds
---
The reset=3 part means that it will reset after 3 seconds of not pressing the macro, not that it will reset 3 seconds from when it's first triggered.
---
Got the same thing while fishing. Spent two hours before I realized and everyones fishing jokes as they passed by made sense finally.
---
I'm well aware of the consequences.  I'm the player that starts passing on loot and not even rolling if I've gotten several upgrades.  If people want to show their true colors and be dicks to the group, fine.  As a healer, I can be a lot more choosy over who I roll with.
---
Classic good
---
Retail bad
---
&gt;	bored at work
---
I’m at a work conference so understand completely lol. I also agree with knowing where your cursor is. Either way, thanks for the help. I learned a new macro thing today so that’s good.
---
The problem here is that you assign an artificial emotional value to using an item that you found yourself. 
---
If the item would be worth equipping instead of selling, the person rolling need should have already bought it on the auction house because it would be worth purchasing for the going price. This is especially true because in the current economy of at least my server there are multiple of most boe blues on the auction house at any time.
---
The value of any boe is objectively the same for all players in a group, no matter if they sell or equip it. Rolling need on bops for the vendor price is different because the vendor price is smaller than the equivalent value of the character improvement from equipping the item in most cases.
---
No, no their not. The utility is only for those that can wear it. Those that can wear it are a) saving the gold value b) getting the utility.

Whats your herbalism at, maybe you need to get the glove enchant and be a tauren and max your herbalism
---
How many druids?
---
Well that was patronising.
---
This comment just convinced me to go download it.  I've been looking for something like this!
---
Ya know I didn’t even notice that at all lol. I too hyped to have the remains of a iconic villain still remain there like it actually happened. Sorta like manaroth In Org.
---
What else you gonna do when you're waiting for your weekly lockout timer? Might as well make the runs go a bit smoother by working out your pre-bis gear.

Well, the idea behind manners and civility is you treat others well and they treat you well. Letting people act like jackasses and then continue with civility is Buddhism.
---
First of all, you're throwing too many big words at me. Because I don't understand them. I'm gonna take that as disrespect.

Which bar addon is this?

Its not going to end badly either.

Priest is using an ability called Mind Control to take control of the enemy's player's character.
---
He then proceeds to make them run off the boat, making them miss their ride, swim back to the dock, and wait until it comes back.
---
For sure. Self-reflection is less common than people with it think, and its most of the battle against changing those habits. The rest is just empathy and discipline. Do unto others and all that.
---
Name another country in the world that has more guns than people and show me the problems that the US experiences with multiple homicdes involving guns.
---
Do you sell all materials on AH?
---
Except Blizzard has already come out and said there are very few active layers for each server so when you talk about this exponential influx of spawning resource nodes you're being incredibly disingenuous. 
---
It's also not accounting for the fact that ***demand*** is much higher as well. There are more people on these servers now than there were back in vanilla, and they are more experienced, so those rare items will be more sought after. More supply + more demand means it's not nearly as bleak as you're trying to make it out to be.
---
There will always be people playing the auction house and farming up rare resources only to unload on the markets at select times. People did it in 2002 and they do it now in retail. Nothing has changed and whether or not layering is in the game for a very brief period isn't going to affect like you think it will.
---
Perfect man ever!!
---
16/0/35 is actually a pretty good spec. Really high melee crit rate.
---
It really depends who you are more afraid of.
---
Are you more afraid of other rogues? Choose Orc.
---
Are you more afraid of priest/warlock? Choose Undead.
---
Our warrior got one first run.

what's happening with my dingus?!??!!?

Did you play on Elune?  
---
I knew a husband/wife Shaman/Hunter back in the day, and I seem to remember a Skullflame being involved.
---
I understand why you would want to cast the highest cast time spell first, but the slightly extra damage over smite isn't worth the extra cast time imo. It seems like you're looking at it as though that cast time for the first spell doesn't matter since the encounter with the mob hasn't begun yet, but the extra cast time will certainly add up over the tens of thousands of times you are opening encounters with holy fire.
---
Not who you were responding to, just for fun I checked.

Wow, keep paying them money as well. Stick it to the man!

You need to tame Echiyakee for the true vanilla experience.
---
Joking of course.  Hunters are the least gear dependent class in general while leveling.  Just keep playing.

I tanked end game as a druid, agro is much easier to generate than warriors and certain fights they're superior. Granted they got a lot better in TBC along with paladins.
---
Don't sweat it man this is a community of old school trolls. I made a post the other day talking about a guy that harassed me for almost 2 hours, because he thought he was helping me by pulling a bunch of mobs in my area and because I didn't see that he was dying it was my fault. The dude said all kinds of rude shit to me and I wanted to kind of start a discussion on here about people being toxic for no reason. Every response I got was TL:DR or you're a dick because you let a faction member die.
---
Oh just realized a 3rd nerd triggered in one go.
---
I don't use healbot and I'm fine without it.  Heales as a priest in BC/Wrath too and never felt the need for any healing-specific addons.

Basically I just have a mouseover macro for dispel magic /  cure disease and everything else is just single target click.  I might create mouse-overs for renew and pws but I haven't felt a strong need to do so.

---
Why leveling my chzr to 60, it's ridiculously easy to level max level anyways!
---
I do like that mentality and I think of it often when I'm vendoring items, but when people dont understand economics and just undercut anything at any price it makes it really hard to justify putting anything on the AH. No one can make money on anything because people are almost paying you to buy it off them.
---
I just feel like people who have played vanilla warrior doesn't want to go through the hassle (more like hell) of leveling a warrior again. 
---
And I'm sure new people either shyed away from rolling a warrior because of its hard-mode reputation, or re-rolled into another class after playing a warrior for a bit.
---
I find myself using Will of the Foreskin so goddamn much, even in certain dungeons. Highly recommend it personally. They also seem better flavor wise, but that's just my idea of what a rogue looks like, not a big meaty muscley beast of a man.
---
I cast spells, I don't scale off anything yet.
---
WoW classic is up and running dude! Download Battle.net, resubscribe to WoW and you get access. Enjoy!

You missed the whole point of the comment.
---
That one was quite clever :p
---
It's all good and usefully you definitely don't need to spend 2 g to increase the added damage to your overpower by 10 ,
---
How ever it gets less fun when the mage in your group didn't bother to learn "remove curse" yet he is running dungeons.
---
It is always pleasure to get a solo player in your team, a real Joy"
---
Is this you using your 1 gold ability? Or your ability disappearing with your money as you would from your enemies? Or am I seeing too much int othis and it's just your money going down the drain?

Didn't know that bit, thanks man.

I map it to Shift+W
---
As a new casual player who has only played levels 1-60 during Warlords of Draenor, I have a couple of questions about some of the systems I have encountered so far.
---
I am playing as a priest, and intend to become a healer. There is however lots of abilities to unlock at the priest trainer. Can I unlock them all? Is there a cap? Will choosing shadow abilities limit me in what I can do as a holy priest later on?
---
Can I still have fishing, mining and cooking all at the same time? Is fishing still decent money?
---
And finally, is there anything important I should know about that could be a disadvantage for me if I do it wrong?
---
If you want my extenive take, for GY, 27 heal/28 dps/29 tank minimum, for lib, 31 heal/32 dps/33 tank minimum, for armory 34 heal/35 dps/36 tank minimum and for cath, 35 heal/36dps and 37 tank minimum.
---
You need to talk to Graham Van Talen in the Rogues Quarter of Undercity.
---
Hyjal is a zone I could see them creating "new" when we go Classic+ after Naxx.  Also Karazhan.
---
You can have autoloot set but if you shift - click then it will still do the normal non auto loot. I do it on occasion when my inventory is full but still looking for cloth or something.
---
I was "friends" with people like this that I met in retail. I don't have many friends, irl or online. I would snap a pic with my phone and send it to them on whatsapp, and they would berate me on that among many many other things. When I started playing classic and met some really chill folks while lvling, I realized that this group I've been friends with for 3+ years were just a bunch of asshat chads with extreme insecurities. Haven't looked back, and made a few more friends along the way.
---
Same here. For anyone who doesn't know, on the left of the bank, when you drop down, there's a meat vendor.
---
Definitely. But honestly, as you upgrade throughout the game, the stats will increase as well as the base damage. Youll probably never see an item that has better stats than your current item and less damage. An upgrade is usually an all around upgrade. But yes, you don't even need to look at the damage on anything but your wands.
---
What do you mean power shifting doesn't work anymore? This is news to me. Can anyone explain?
---
I’m too busy eating my avocado toast to say thank you
---
Thats not true at all, I played since classic through Cata and people started needing BOE all the time because ninjas were a real thing. You can still find videos of high profile raids having their loot ninjad and not on Pservers.
---
Everyone needs BOE big ticket items and then nobody gets screwed, just the way it works.
---
I used to do that in Sunwell platue with my rogue. Stealth RIGHT in front of NPC and when they spam right click and reveal me..DED
---
I got that shield from UD Strat back in vanilla, and was kicked from the group and publicly shamed for days because of it.
---
I was a hunter who filled a slot for some random guild, so I’m the only one in the group not in their guild. At the beginning everyone agrees to “need all BoEs”. You know, the way you do. Halfway through, skullflame drops, and we all need. I win. 
---
Suddenly, I’m being told “Wtf give that to the tank what are you thinking?!” Someone says “Fucking hunter just ninja looted skullflame shield - AnInfiniteArc” in general. 
---
I say, Jesus, we agreed to need BoEs, nobody said there were any exceptions. This shit will sell for enough for me to get my epic mount.
---
I start getting whispers from people in their guild and general chat is tearing in to me.
---
I point out that everyone needed for it, and they said they were trying to prevent my from ninja’ing and would have just given it to the tank. I offer to sell it to him - half of AH value. No, fuck you. I offer it to him for 50g. It was worth *at least* four times that on my realm at the time. Now I’m kicked from the group. I hearth back to IF and people are talking about me THERE. 
---
I ended up being harassed for a solid 3 days. I auctioned that shit and never looked back.
---
I get this kind of makes me an asshole, but here’s the thing: If they hadn’t said need BoEs, I wouldn’t have rolled need. That rule doesn’t work unless everyone agrees. I literally just did what we agreed to. Second, if they had asked me nicely, like, “Hey man, the warrior super needs that, could you consider giving it to him?” I would have most likely said yeah, sure thing. I know how that shit feels. I’ve lost really nice gun upgrades to Warriors. But that’s how that poor rule works - it doesn’t always feel good, but it’s fair. BoEs - especially Epics, have value whether you equip it or not. 
---
But no. They treated me like an asshole and *demanded* I hand it over. Fuck that. Fuck them. 
---
Grats, though. Seriously.
---
I... well damn. Thanks.
---
Going slower in Classic is not something I could do willingly
---
My pleasure!
---
I feel like we will only see mages on epic mounts for a while.
---
Why aren’t I 5k queue spots ahead you might ask? 
---
Pokémon go to the fresh realms you deplorables.
---
r/im14andthisiswoooosh
---
You should have both as hotkeys.
---
Level 3 for damage, level 1 is purely for CC purposes.
---
So far I have a 12 Priest, 14 Shaman, 6 mage, and 5 Paladin
---
You dont need any in prot, and it's perfectly viable while leveling
---
Compared to the uber elite pros of reddit, sure I guess.
---
That’s what I was trying to say haha just worded it weird
---
What are the downsides of being a feral tank? Will I have issues tanking in dungeons or raids?
---
Well the good news is you've found a way to fell superior to both.
---
Until you get to ranged weapons with stats, thrown are better because they don't take up inventory slots for ammo.
---
You shouldn't really need to stance dance too much while tanking, just use battle and demo Shout for AoE aggro, along with tab sunders.
---
Once you BG's are implemented again you will be able to PVP at level 10. The brackets go 10-19, 20-29,30-39,40-49,50-59,60.

Been calling Bloodsail my home since Classic started.  Pretty much every group I've joined has had friendly folks, and I can see the beginnings of RP guilds, so I'm excited for that to get more intense.  Just have to try and get to 60 before getting heavily invested into any of that.
---
Yea we tried doing RFD and it felt like a waste as well. Time to travel there as Alliance is something to consider, but the dungeon itself just doesn't run as quickly as SM Cath. Harder pulls in general slows things down and the layout of the dungeon is confusing and not great, either.
---
I just hit 40 but I'm thinking of doing maybe another level in Cath before trying to move on to something else.
---
I made a pally the other day and immediately checked off I could get under stormwind - yes, yes you can
---
should have introduced rated bg's instead in my opinion.  arena was a mistake even though i love TBC, you cant have balanced mmo pvp in 2v2 3v3 or 5v5.
---
If you're tanking a mob with a line of sight attack or cone of effect, please for the love of got turn them away from the group.  This is a basic tanking strat in general.   You have them aggroed.  Turn them away from your pals.
---
Oh man. 4th time I was running back to the north east corner of the barrens to the oil rig for that stupid quest and I died again. And I logged off. I need ragged a bit but then remembered. Eh this was the game. And you know what it’s exactly how frustrating it used to make you. But when I finnally get that crit to go my way instead of the elites way. Or if I find a potion on a respawn as I’m going back up to kill the one guy I need. That gives me the edge to win it all. Oof it makes its so satisfying to take their pelt/head/horn/ whatever back and say here you got quest giver. I fucking did it. Gimme my ten silver and my 2k exp. I have another 10 deaths to do one another elite.
---
Outlands were neat but Shattrath City killed it for me. It was the ONLY place you could hearth without giving yourself a disadvantage.
---
Also it turned the original World we loved into a grind before the “real content”. It was the start of zones just being dead because there was no reason to be in Azeroth anymore.
---
Back at it again with the prostitution.
---
Faith in humanity: restored.
---
You don't get to Equip it AND sell it on the AH. Once it is equipped it only has utility and vendor value.
---
No one is counted all of the rolls they lost as negative gold value. That doesn't make any fucking sense.
---
If we are going to include saving gold value we have to include losing rolls as negative gold value.
---
A+B=A-(-B)
---
Utility value + gold value saved = Utility value - gold value not lost.
---
Get the Spy addon. Its primary purpose is to help you make and keep track of that kind of list, and warn you when you see someone on your list.
---
I chose the 'Classic' option on the slider and haven't looked back.
---
Haha I've seen him running around!
---
People need to stop doing this joke it’s not funny anymore
---
My only hope is all the major superpowers coordinate, ratchet up the pressure, and don't let up until their entire system comes tumbling down.
---
My 81 silver is crying. I'm about to hit level 14, time for a new round of spells. Unfortunately as a warlock you can't skimp on any of it if you want to do any sort of reasonable DPS :(
---
you are fucking braindead
---
All the cool kids call it CC now

---
Haha that does sound lovely. Out of curiosity, what did you prefer to spend your gold on?

Lol, it's gonna be so funny watching your channel burn

He a fucking douchebg who earned nothing in the game, and everyhting he has gotten has been from people giving him or helping him. hes a fucking nobody on his own.
---
I know the word isn't used in writing a lot: Clique\*
---
Yeah, it's like $8.00/mo or something.
---
There's a different textures option?
---
If you want to make zero decisions and essentially play a single player game with a co-op option then go for it. If you want an mmo play classic
---
That's right
---
Totally agree mate!
---
&gt;RE: (C), what's /s ?
---
I use page up page down in increments of 5 with the addon "Max Camera Distance"
---
Never had a queue on mankrik since launch
---
Make me COL... Cackle Out Loud.
---
Okay, here's the idea: Sell Plain Letters with $10 Visa gift card codes on them on the AH for however much gold 10 bucks is worth, then advertise online. Until someone copies you, and the AH becomes a bunch of meme letters, you could easily by a couple hundred Gold, or whatever the conversion rate is. Probably against ToS, but idk bc it's using legit game functions.
---
If they asked like we did (didnt demand), yes id let them roll for it, who gives a shit, am I really going to let human greed even infiltrate my gaming?
---
Nah, you're too scared to admit it. No one here will believe your lies
---
Would they ever add expansions to classic again
---
Odds are that if you are in a group of 5 random people without clear loot distribution rules, odds are you won't get a bad rep. No one will care after a day or so.  
---
I've seen a few ninja looters and even mentioned them in my guild chat or other things. I honestly can't remember one of their names now or the guild they were in.  
---
The servers are huge and it would take more than a few single acts to ruin your reputation on a wider scale.
---
By the definition of greed, someone would actually hit NEED because they would be putting their wants above what is best for others, so yea..there is your real world definition of GREED.
---
Surprised I had to come this far down to find it. This is the reality right here. Unless you're in a guild group, #2 is sure to happen. 
---
Also I don't get why people get so fussed over the 'temporary' upgrade assuming you're all leveling. 
---
If a dope twink item drops while I'm leveling, even if I can use it, I'm putting that thing up on the AH. If I use it, I'll have it for 10-15 levels then replace it. Did it help my leveling speed? Sure - probably a little, but I'd rather take the gold in that tradeoff.
---
You can use slash commands to talk to NPCs without clicking, but yeah most people don't know that.
---
Amazing how people don't like assholes
---
Man a toilet
---
Uh, why? Because it's PvP? If someone just wants to PvP there are a _ton_ of non-RP PvP servers to choose from, why roll a character on an RP server if that's not what they're looking for?
---
And dodge
---
LMFAO, crying over someone saying a bad words. You poor thing, how will you ever recover from this
---
I respect that, but for what?
---
Not saying like textures. But the way things look do change when u use the slider they give u in options. I have mine in classic right now. But putting it on 4 or 5 wouldn't be a bad idea imo
---
Serpent bloom, I’ve ran the dungeon twice now and the issue is I stillll don’t have enough deviant hides
---
dead world pvp
---
Well dont hold your breath
---
Those other countries that have orders of magnitude fewer murders and terrorist attacks than us? Yes, those countries.
---
the item will be selling in the AH, making it the same value to everyone as it is a BoE....
---
yeah i'm at 60c so what it doesn't hurt anyone
---
I can't wait until those kind of dumbdumbs quit
---
Naw you always wanna cast soemthing with a cast time first while you're still ooc it's a free cast
---
I’m fine with flying mounts but think they could have been done better. I honestly think zone integration was the worst. Outlands and Shattrath City started making Azeroth feel like a burden to get through.
---
10/10 name
---
Same for rn. I'm thinkin of giving a higher option a try. Can u tell me any of why u wanna keep it on classic ? I like to know ur opinion or perspective
---
Ice block removes silence and spell lockouts.
---
What servers are close to 50/50 with ally and horde?
---
I mean its hard to explain an answer if they dont understand the base of how it works. 
---
I for one am tired of people who dont understand shit claiming information is fake till they read it from a published article or a dev post lmao. Fucking morons.
---
Because they get blamed for any problems.  Kind of like a jungler in league of legends, they're toxic because they take more shit than other people.
---
[https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mind\_Control](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mind_Control)
---
The mind control spell specifies exactly the range they can be. It does not act like most other spells that there is a chance when they are much higher level.
---
Ex.: Rank 3 learned at level 58 can control a creature up to 4 levels higher than the caster.
---
I’m level 50 and I’m already planning my next one

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d0m6y2/discussion_is_my_druid_a_cannibal_when_it_eats/). 
---
No, you won’t have trouble finding groups because you’re a hunter.
---
That would be the worst thing ever imo
---
I don't think layering is or as was as a big of an issue as people made it out to be. According to the blue posts on the forum, the layers per server are low single digits (2-3) on the most POPULACE servers, so while it might speed things up a little it's not like it blew the vanilla record out of the water, the new record wasn't much off the old. 
---
The classic record was over 3.3 days while the vanilla record was 4.8. He was faster, and layering helped, but the fact that classic is 1.12 and there has been 15 years of theory and min maxing probably helped more than just layering.
---
That awkward moment where I got one with in my first 20 kills, then nothing in the 500 kills since...
---
Yeah.  I'm not looking to duplicate it, I was more so just curious.    
---
Also, I saw his gear after he hit 60.  It was insanely bad.
---
PvP with gadgets ignores how much money it takes to make those gadgets and keep a ready supply of them on you.  I'd rather spend my time and money getting my tailoring and enchanting up for my priest or using engineering because I love the idea of making my own rifles and ammo as a hunter.
---
If your horde on Skeram shoot me a PM and I can help you out.
---
Fireblast &gt; People that won't group with me for a quest spawn.
---
I mean a fat SoC proc is equally spicy
---
steam is fillllleed with MVP garbage
---
sadly you say?
---
It’s a quest reward
---
What do you mean now that MC is so easy? MC hasn't changed in difficulty. And wont change in difficulty for the majority of players. WoTLk 10 man naxx was downed in the first week. that didn't change anything for the rest of the expansion.
---
The guild is on Incendius for anyone who would like to join :)
---
Also there are multiple talent trees, check the tabs!! (Why no, I totally meant to go down the discipline tab, it had nothing to do with this tip :D)
---
Because it hurts their feelins and makes them sad :(((((
---
Also it gives them an opportunity to be smug and holier than thou while people praise them for it.
---
This just sounds like a way to split the community even more than will already happen with classic+ a new retail xpac
---
In the names section of interface options, check the box next to NPCs
---
That is basically ungoro tho.  You just go literally anywhere, kill/loot everything and you are working on your quests.  Definitely one of my fav zones.
---
&gt;This isn't some calculation that needs to be done
---
There is no calculation.
---
The item is worth its gold value on the AH which its utility value from equipping it. It is worth exactly the same amount to everyone in the group.
---
I had a mage help me at the end of my warlock quest where there's a tree guarded by a bunch of hard hitting locks, I had all red armor and couldn't possibly fight them alone, he stayed there for literally 20 minutes to help me get the wood so I could finally get the succubus, tried to tip him and he refused. 
---
Really stuff like that can make classic way better
---
Would *you* like to explain what power shifting is?
---
Sold stuff on the ah and looted a lot of greens pretty much. Never buy anything except arrows. iam on 210g now :^)
---
Use the upvote button.
---
This needs to be patched. It was patched later on. Goldsellers dream spot.
---
SLANGGG??
---
I'm not looking forward to raiding on mage. Making stupid amounts of water and spamming frostbolt till the end of time. Healing is actually pretty fun in raids tho.
---
&gt;  levelling and a lot of other things are super easy but mythic dungeons and raids, are insanely challenging and require you to really know your class and the instance.
---
Lmao, no they absolutely are not. That shit is mind numbingly easy.
---
Leveling in Classic is harder.
---
Leatrix maps and mapster addons do this in game for you. Itll show you what level each area is and itll show the map even if you havent discovered anything.
---
Nah it's Mad Max
---
The point was he's not failing classic wow because he's only lvl 40. It's like you said, the most important part is to enjoy it and i know a lot of people who commited to a guild who wanted members to powerlvl as quickly as possible and many of them were just exhausted of it. So not much of an enjoyment right? I actually did an evening of SM runs on a Warlock with a fun group and we chattet on Discord. Met some new players that way. But doing that for days on end.. can't think of anyone truely enjoying that.
---
Go to options under graphics or visual.
---
I'm pretty sure you'll have to drop and restart all of LW from scratch. You can't just drop a specialization.
---
It's good for AOE threat on lots of mobs, where the damage mitigation makes a larger difference.
---
Ran my first deadmines at level 18 and it dropped straight away haha. Made my life so much easier!
---
Rondokur? Who’s that?
---
Thank ya Thank ya
---
That's how the community gets divided and we get multiple dead gamea
---
Do you buy food for your pet?   All i buy is arrows and meat and im broke af
---
In all honestly, it's not even really that big a deal. Like you said about exaggeration, some of the responses are just blowing my comment out of proportion. This is literally less than a percent of a percent of my radar. I'm nothing but loving the game and my experience so far. I was just curious about people manipulating it by maybe going to a certain part of the zone to auto switch or something. Like someone could just piss a bunch of people off in a dungeon, hop layers on purpose, and get right back in another one where no one knows they're gonna screw everyone over again.
---
Try it. It's free and honestly it's the better game. Someone said it quite right I guess.
---
Classic is the better rpg - Retail is the better game
---
No they don't. They can go buy it. 
---
It's not like a boss drop where the only way to obtain it is to find a group and kill the boss.
---
holy shit, I've played since vanilla and never thought about this....
---
I always assumed macros used the highest skill. Now I'll actually have to check that..
---
Do you guys actually like slow walk for this? Cuz that would actually be cool af to see lol
---
I don't think Holy Fire is less damage than Mind Blast.  Level 24 Holy Fire does 148 damage for 95 mana, or 1.55dpm, while level 22 Mind Blast does 116 damage for 110 mana, or 1.05 dpm.
---
Bite me, "dude".
---
Normally the old context was rape and pillage the land for everything it's worth etc. Mining, farming  tree cutting etc etc.
---
Sadly the history of the world is mostly male centric so the planet is referenced as female. For example Gaia mother of Earth.
---
By today's standard it wouldn't fly but the world has changed a lot in 15 years.
---
Yeah. I have that issue on Mage as well. If it becomes a consistent problem, I'll just enable a weakaura for it that will annoy me until I reapply it. lol
---
Its just pixels, bro
---
Crowd Control. It refers to abilities that help you manage pulls such as slows and polymorph
---
To anyone QQing, this is the solution
---
As a 16 hour tank ahead of friends I can relate, thought don't know about raging, most groups have been a joy only bad experience was a hunter needing on Corpsemaker over me and a shammy, the positive is the weapon drops often, 
---
I kinda enjoy meeting up new people, dungeon running one if the better ways to make new friendships.
---
Then again if someone goes hardcore speccing fully in prot in low levels and endlessly grinding them dungeons, I see how they might just start every run on the left foot. 
---
They should also take the agro pulling as a great learning experience, the tank that can hold agro only in strickt correct 100% pulls ain't really good tank, that's just bare minimum rank, and I feel now that in vannila 95% of all thanks were actually really bad by today's standards and I mean the 95% of committed tanks if not 99%
---
Remind them that there is fun in learning to adjusting in the moment, and finding solutions and optimizations to your tanking, it's easy to get really worked up about the wrong things.
---
P.s.
---
For warrior deaths are really funking painfully repair bills are incredibly cruel it really motivated you to find reliable cheep alchemist for health pots.
---
We will all gladly go down with this ship
---
Many people are irrational and emotional I guess.
---
Smoke it with the giant Tauren pipe.
---
Seriously. I find most mods to be so unbearably ugly and clunky to set up. All you have to do is click on the faces and press the buttons on your keyboard... sure it can get hectic sometimes but it takes about as much skill as a clipping your toenails.
---
I use a razer naga haha. But once I hit end game in mmos I usually switch up my bindings to keys.
---
Hunters would do the same by taming Sar'koth in the orc/troll starting area
---
This also
---
rofl
---
Thank you kindly! :)
---
Negative
---
Or when 15 level 30s show up
---
I just don't care lol. And many dont. Imagine thinking this is important XD
---
It is the only fair AND risk free system
---
Your dad. Right
---
I see, so the auction houses are specific to each layer?  And Blizzard has come out and said that it is impossible for someone to switch layers in an effort to manipulate item prices?
---
This is the shit that makes me wanna play on my rp server guy lol
---
Meh, I just hate shitposts.
---
All good, thanks for the concern!! I don't like social interactions like going out to dinner often, go to loud places like bars or clubs etc. But camping is my one true get away and source of enjoyment with the guys. They know that too, i'm at the age where all my friends want to spend 75% of their time and paychecks at the bar, just isn't for me.
---
You don't know what happened, leader could have kicked somebody and quickly invited you. More likely I would say than a group just being a dick.
---
Always planned on an alt but had to itch it a little last night.  Was leveling warrior first mid 40's but had to start my mage.  Took him to 12 quick now he can sit around and get some rested xp at least.  Probably not much rested because I learned I really miss playing mage, but wasn't my warrior to 60.
---
Looks like you shouldn't be on a PvP server.
---
Yeah it does. GW2 stops doing this after the personal story thank God
---
I think there is an addon for that. I need it myself too. :D
---
No, it isn't equal to everyone. You can get gold from literally everything else in the game, like I said before, but you can only get that item from that one enemy.
---
If you want gold that badly then go farm it, don't ninja items away from people who would be using it.
---
People also confuse real time and in game time. You gotta be a special kind of noob to take 2-3 months of in game time to reach level 60.
---
It's true. Not only can we do this to enemies, but we can watch allies die if they piss us off enough. I regret nothing.
---
My orc axe is still missing
---
It's Humans that get +5% spirit, right? That's a very strong racial for a PvE priest...
---
If the weapon is that much of an upgrade for you, you can buy it on the AH. 
---
My mount will significantly decrease the time it takes me to get to 60. 
---
You see how the same item can help us achieve the same goal for the same cost? That's why we need on it.
---
Except some people NEED the item to use it, while the others want to sell it for GREED. 
---
Very simple, I’m sorry basic logic is hard for you and I don’t really care for another verbal bowel movement like you just gave me. Thanks.
---
you would hate any wpvp
---
I only ever played the same warrior in Classic up til Cata. Playing a warrior again now and I feel I’m pretty clued up on the class - when I hear my mates talking about their class it is absolute fucking gibberish
---
Now if they could just put pets on their frames to heal it when it's off-tanking dungeons, that'd be great.
---
Thanks super informative.
---
Today I died in the northern most area of Alterac Mountains (Dark Council quest) and it put me back in the soutshore graveyard.  I died 3-4 more times because apparently it's a gamble as a warrior whether i can kill something one level higher than me.  2 more levels til mortal strike.  I hope it gets better, cause that's the angriest I've been.
---
while i do agree with you over all, I really hate chainmail bikinis like this
---
I was planning on maining a Warlock and  was boxing a Shammy as a pocket healer. Got both  up to 19 on both and fell in love with the Shammy and stopped boxing and I'm going to main shaman now.
---
I dunno, i like the nostalgia but i'm at a cool job i like on a longer career path. Wow classic is just super duper comfy and relaxing
---
&gt;Most horde are still complete jerks on PvP servers and go out of their way to attack the most peaceful allies. Nothing has changed here in 15 years.
---
That some funny Alliance propaganda you got there
---
human priests get feedback (meh) and desperate prayer (!!!) which are both not completely dead spells
---
Appreciate the effort. But you should delete this post. You’re gonna get people killed. Repost your updated one and I’ll updoot
---
I leveled a rogue back in vanilla with alchemy and herbalism and I have zero regrets from it.  My fondest memories are trying to sneak through higher levels zones because I wanted herbs I was too low level to safely get normally.
---
Know that a lot of the crafting professions are hard to keep at your level unless you do some farming for them.  As long as you are aware of that, do what makes you happy.  If you want to wear a full set of gear you made, there is a certain pride in that.  If you want to focus on leveling and money, that's fine too.
---
Hi, /u/SHJ234
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d0mfm1/hunters_are_evolving/). 
---
Oh I remember, in Vanilla my college roommate was the first person on the horde side of our server to have an epic mount, he stood on top of the org bank mailbox and there was a CROWD of people around.
---
You don't care about speed, you actually care about the damage range. 
---
I don't know much about warriors in particular but here's where advice like this is actually coming from: any attacks that say "normal weapon damage" or "X% of weapon damage" will obviously do more damage with a higher damage weapon. But comparing two weapons of somewhat similar DPS the slower one will have a higher damage per hit.
---
If your faster weapon has much higher DPS it might have a bigger damage range too.
---
That is an insightful and thought provoking bit of information, thank you for sharing.  I would like to offer a rebuttal. Consider, for a moment, that *I* love classic.
---
You probably need to raid at least a little.
---
I am sorry, I am the one using logic here, you are being stubborn.  The logical thing to do for everybody in the group is to SELL the item because it's gold value far exceeds the utility value as I already explained in detail in an earlier post above.
---
The one Needing it for use, could sell it and upgrade 5 other gear slots and still have enough left to buy 4 mooncloth bags....   that's FAR more rational to do than equipping  such a jackpot item.
---
??? Why would u search "what is active game time" when your question is "do you need a subscription/game time for WoW classic"???
---
Usually no unless it says so. Sometimes you have special debuff that you can stack if you have some talent for it. I am not sure about moonfire specifically. If it's stacked you should see a small 2, or some number on the debuff; if you don't then it doesn't stack as far as I know.
---
If you build it correctly then no, you will not have issues. There is a whole discord dedicated to Druids in classic. You might wanna look up a guide there.
---
Downsides of being Druid is that you don’t excel at anything.
---
Hahahahaha I’m alliance on Blaumeux! 
---
If you see a female night elf warrior at SM tonight named “Zoe” is me!! 
---
Apologies for any ganking 😜
---
Already said it elsewhere in the thread but the mob needs to be green to YOU at least for him to get full xp when you're doing the killing. They either mentioned it in a blue post or the Q&amp;A, I can't remember where. Confirmed though as I heal my mage alt with my priest and gets basically no xp if I damage the mobs instead of just heal the mage. When boosting a druid friend he got full xp when I dealt damage though because the mobs were still green to my priest.
---
lmfao amish styled
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
No but it dosnt make them easy
---
I legit can't read the difference in my head
---
If it's bugged /reload ui will often take you out of combat.
---
If your speccing for pom your loosing control and damage as frost.  Can't have your cake and eat it here.  The point is classic, like vanilla is not balanced.  It's not meant to be.  Some classes shine in different situations.  Mages have a lot going for them, if you can play them well, but they are by no means a god class that can't be beat.
---
blizzard will do what they can when they need to, this is a cash cow. they dont want anyone to leave.
---
Yeah, shadow is the best school of magic and every gnome should know that.
---
Feral druids have been the best tanks from 15-35 so far in my leveling experience.
---
 Thanks buddy! You're the best!
---
He was in several Warcraft 2 missions as well, and a protagonist in the expansion, Beyond the Dark Portal.
---
Fuck school, grinding for your lvl 40 mount is way more important. Your real life can wait.
---
Lolled hard at "gorilla warfare" gotta go OOK
---
The error is because PetAttack() isn't allowed in the live macro engine. You have to use /petattack instead. I assume it's probably the same with CastPetAction() but you can just do /use abilityname instead.
---
Also, if you want to use multiple skills with a GCD, you have to use /castsequence.
---
I dont know for sure but I remember reading that Troll Shadow Priest was good because the orbs could proc it.
---
Oh wow Raptor Strike crit, scary
---
I feel like it's for selling gold I highly doubt they do those so someone can accidentally click it like some people are suggesting
---
That's fine, I'm not trying to change your mind - you enjoy what you enjoy. However, I do think you should be accurate in your criticisms if you're going to give them, because otherwise you just look foolish.
---
* If you see someone say "I don't like Classic". That's fine - they don't like Classic and they're entitled to that opinion; they don't even need a reason, just like you don't need a reason to dislike black beans.
---
* If you see someone say "I don't like Classic, because I hate PvP", well that doesn't make sense, because there are PvE servers that don't force you into PvP.
---
I want this
---
Any chance at all u like certain things in classic graphics ?
---
Do u strongly suggest I use higher graphic setting ?
---
I'm open and wanna know ur opinion too

Wisp form while dead doesn't sound impactful until you realize just how much and how far you'll be corpse walking
---
Just read through this whole chain, and you are wrong. The other guy is right. Think of it this way, maybe the person who wins the item can't wear it. But he can sell it on the AH for 100g and then use that money to buy a 100g item that he can use. Essentially, anyone can trade the BoE item for an equal item of value + utility.  
---
In addition, you can't say that the person rolling need on the item is saving gold. He is losing out on 100g in opportunity cost by equipping the item and not selling it. The character can either have 100g or have the item, he can't have both. Therefore, your A+B &gt; A is flat out wrong and bullshit.
---
I also considered that, but could not find any guidelines to set it up, if you figure something out   i would love to hear from you!

Hmm why is my dog going crazy all of a sudden?
---
It seems like in China it's not so much, "don't commit crimes", but "don't get caught committing crimes".
---
That hurts me in my soul and I thought I had lost it farming this.
---
Set meaningful limitations to when i can game. I normally try to game when a friend is online. Outside of that, I'll make it a point to go and do something else IRL.
---
It's tough. Not wanting to disconnect because of fear for server queues really got me as well.
---
I’m pretty happy with my life direction right now, but there is definitely a lot of truth to my youthful nostalgia and WoW being one in the same. I have a long list of memories as a young teenager where WoW was in the periphery. A lot of family holidays that I was happy to eat at, but also excited to get back to the ingame Christmas events. Surprise school cancellations from snow while I level my hunter next to a mini heater. Coming home from the local pool in midsummer burnt to a crisp and playing shirtless, trying to not touch my chair. Shooting the shit with guildies not long after the New Year flipped over. 
---
I don’t think I realized how many memories were wrapped up in this game until actually logging into Classic. And even then it took me walking through the gates of old Orgrimmar. I got emotional, won’t even lie. 
---
There is so much special about WoW as a game and MMORPG, don’t get me wrong. But I’d not be surprised in the least if what many people were trying to rediscover is that magical feeling of having a whole day in Azeroth and not knowing what mom is making for dinner. We won’t ever get to go back to that time, precisely. But we can definitely go back to that Azeroth and, man, much to the detriment of my actual real life work, I’ve found that there is no place I’d rather be this week. I did not know there was a piece of my soul in this game; so happy I found it again.
---
&gt;Server transfers are like abortions, you dont want them to happen, but people need to know they have that option in times of crisis, like a wow server dying.
---
There's a reason why abortions are covered medical procedures instead of paid ones in most countries... If something's necessary, whether or not you can afford it shouldn't be in the equation should it?
---
Beyond that I don't think you understand how transfers work. I'm on a "middling" pop server with small but consistent queue times during rush hour. We aren't getting transfers.
---
Druids have their own fun with beasts as well ;)
---
Just here to say- same scenario but 15 years earlier. I didn't manage it. Lost scholarships and cost myself thousands. Quit too late. Sober for nearly 15 years. Relapsed now. Get out while you can :)
---
Eventually they will merge realms if some die, high to low transfers.  Best to let blizzard handle the balance or you get problems with ninjas or just toxic people in general hopping realms to cause all kinds of problems in a fresh environment.  If you allow paid transfers those low pop realms that might be good right now with just a layer or two suddenly can't fill one layer because people left already.
---
point of personal privilege. He/Him. You forgot to say point of personal privilege and tell us your personal pronouns.
---
Hmm how can I tell what the server time? I guess I've just been playing during late night US time zones so all I've been seeing is daylight
---
Bad single target threat generation, bad physical mitigation compared to warrior. But bear tanks are fine until 40mans, and even then they're acceptable in casual guilds.
---
This made me laugh
---
The guy in the comments who said Alenya sounds like a Karen
---
Dude the Chinese people rioted and tore down schools because the schools tried to stop then from cheating on the sat. The Chinese government bases their entire economy on stolen technology from other countries, China is one of the only xoi tries to be region locked out of most competetive games because the game companies know that Chinese can't be allowed on servers with normal people. This is all easily Googled. Their entire Coulter is literally "cheat as much as possible, fuck everyone else" in every aspect of their lives
---
Alliance have quests in stonetalon
---
I kinda have to agree with this
---
I don't get it :(
---
As a healer, if you are lowering your health by life tapping to reckless levels or pulling aggro recklessly, I'm going to treat it exactly the same.  Be responsible and manage your life total.  I'm not your baby sitter.
---
lvl 24 mage here, I always spam intellect on anyone who passes - warriors and all! I respect priests the most and will ask if they would like some FUGI water in hopes they will befriend me
---
Well of course I know him, he's me.
---
And with wing clip, who cares how much damage it does? You're using it for the debuff. Rank 1 is cheaper and gets the job done. On my mage, level 1 frost nova is the only rank ever going on my bar.
---
Made a paladin on launch night, had fun and got to 5. Next day there was a queue on that server so I switched and made an undead priest. Then I played an orc shaman to 14 and not I’m playing a lvl 6 mage
---
Once guild is formed you can kick everyone but your friends.
---
Find a group for RFC as one of your DPS characters. Stay back, don't pull anything, shoot spells at whatever the tank is targeting (target your tank and press 'f' to target his target). If you pull aggro, run towards the tank, not away from him.
---
Don't hit "need" on something you can't (or won't) use, but feel free to hit it on any upgrade. Don't grab any chests you see, type "/roll" instead, and the highest roll in the group gets the chest.
---
You pretty much can't fail as a DPS doing RFC, and after you do it one time you'll suddenly feel so much more comfortable running dungeons. 
---
The fact that you're hesitant to run a group because you don't want to inconvenience people shows me that you probably won't be a tongue-dragger like OP's meme. I guarantee you the dungeons and the people running them are scarier in your head than they actually are!
---
Shadow bolt is ineffective because of the mana cost and long cast time.
---
Ideal leveling for warlock using either void or succ, succ is better but void is a bit easier and safer. And you cast your corruption and coa, and wand down the target while you pet attacks. You use almost no mana and it’s quick. If you start getting low, then use drain life instead of wand.
---
After level 30, ideally you should just be using succubus, send her to attack and cast immolate while she’s running there to atk. Then go into corruption, coa, and either drain life or wand. Starting at lvl 30 drain life is better dps but costs mana. So if you have full health, you can choose if you want to wand or drain life based on your mana. If you don’t have full health use drain life.
---
Follow this method, use life tap for mana and you should have almost no downtime, and never need food or water (first aid helps).
---
I get it you're angry you play WoW on easymode but want to look like you aren't
---
Hunters dps is not the best and doesnt scale well into later raids. However, they are needed for kiting and tranq shot so it is necessary to bring a couple for many raids. Obviously there was a ton of hunters in vanilla, but on private servers the three most common dps are warrior rogue mage.  This means that while there are more raid slots for mage, this may be balanced out by more people playing mage.So yes, you wont have as good of dps or be topping any charts but you do have an important job that makes you necessary.
---
On top of all this there are quality of life consideration, solo leveling as a mage is a lot more boring imo than as a hunter unless you like mage aoe grinding. Also, the endgame hunter dps rotation is one of if not the most skill based/ nuanced in all of vanilla while mages is like %90 forstbolt. Also gearing a hunter is easier as you dont need to compete with a bunch of other clothies like mage. In the end if you're actually a skilled hunter you can definitely find spots in raid, it may be easier as a mage though since there are just more slots.
---
Got all the way up to setting my touchpad keys and everything game worked and I was able to play on my Wi-Fi network. Then I tried to switch over to my phone's mobile network...

As someone who played alliance in vanilla as a WARRIOR in one of the most populated pvp servers back then, you need to chill the fuck out. Posts like these popped up on wow forums daily about how horde need to be nerfed and all that bullshit. And you only complaining about getting ganked? You srs? Like is this a troll post? You expecting a war mode to be added to classic or some shit?
---
You in STVietnam homie. Welcome to world of Warcraft, get a group, march your ass down to STV from duskwood and go get some of those horde asses like a real member of the alliance.
---
According to some guides, Spirit is tied with Agility as the best stat for a leveling rogue.

Power shifting is a method of using a macro to shift out and back into cat form for feral dps in classic, granting the cat 40 energy from the Furor talent and 20 energy from wolfshead helm. 
---
YouTube shedo the druid for more info.
---
No. It can be just one guild leader, if you get the required sigs and kick everyone else out.
---
lmao I know what I'm gonna do tonight, drop some spicy memes in the auction house
---
&gt; Nah, I rolled pvp because I'm not a carebear who complains when one faction fucks with the other.
---
No, you're just complaining when someone implies your character is lesser. Just as carebear in my book.
---
&gt;  Again, if you don't like it, stick to pve.
---
"If you don't like one small aspect of something then just avoid the entire thing". I already told you how I handle it. I just don't do it. Are you this dumb in real life too?
---
Please explain.
---
I never sell my herbs, it's just I didn;t find enough while casually leveling to get it up to it's cap. 
---
Had to go back and farm silver leaf and some briar thorn but that was about it.
---
Need it anyway, because you need the large amount of gold. Gold lasts far longer than a slightly better than blue drop. Because one day, someones going to stab you in the back, ^may ^or ^may ^not ^be ^a ^~~hunter~~ ^rogue , and need that BoE you greeded because greed is money in your mind. At the end of the day, when the drop happens, *do you really trust your random party members to do the right thing?*
---
Although, the only drop that stands out to me is Edgemaster's Handguards, if they drop, expect your warrior to paint their walls white. And be very angry when the hunter/shaman/paladin needs them because "But they're mail.".
---
This is so hard to remember when you're panicking, lol
---
If someone likes it enough to equip it he should buy it on the auction house anyway.
---
Because it has some of the attributes of PVP without being a full PVP server if you're so worried about RP then why don't you go to a full RP server?.
---
Lord of the Rings and Warcraft have the best dwarves

Okay, it seems like you got a addictive personality - as in, you get addicted to things easily. I would suggest that you systematically cut down on gametime to manage this. With the endgoal to quit WoW completely because it's addictive nature is too much for you to handle. Set realistic goals. Day1: Play wow 10.5 hours. Day2: Play wow 10 hours. Day3: Play wow 9.5 hours etc. You should also find another form of entertainment that isn't as dangerous as wow. Good luck mate.
---
That's the best part of the whole meme
---
It’s not what you want to hear: quit. 
---
Future you will thank yourself. This game is near impossible to take in moderation.
---
Got my fishing pole on the first trap I clicked when I went to try to farm it the other day. Was so happy to avoid that grind lol.

Use Wow as a reward, do your work, study and take a break to play wow as a reward for doing your work.

As someone who failed out of college because of video games (have since graduated college) it’s not worth it. Spend the time studying, I could not even tell you what I was playing or who I was playing with. But I know I skipped classes and didn’t do all my assignments.

I play retail so I can make gold to fund my wow classic addiction. It only takes an hour of my time and I make about 20k-30k gold a day

I've read a lot of your replies to people and it seems like you are saying you and your friends need everything together. Is this the case or are you assuming everyone needs everything, and when people actually follow the proper rules then you "accidently" ninja loot?

I buy food sometimes. Other times i kill murlocs or beasts and I get food from them. But at later levels you probably wanna buy since low quality food isn't good enough and gives little happiness. It's mostly about selling greens though and being conservative.
---
THE GREATER GOOD!
---
I played vanilla when IT years ago. I was done school but I ruined a relationship with a great lady. 
---
Life is about moderation. I set myself rules to play. Here’s an example of a week day;
---
8am wake up
---
9am gym (1 hour/3 times a week)
---
11am lunch and meal prep 
---
Mid day chores (laundry, groceries, errands)
---
3pm-11pm afternoon work shift
---
1130pm-1am Warcraft
---
If completed all my tasks during the weekday, I would allow myself to play until I had to leave for work. Week nights I would try for a reasonable “late” bedtime. No 3ams. 
---
Weekends (as a mid 20s) I’d game, if I didn’t have other plans with friends or family. 
---
Trust me! Moderation! Work now and reap the benefits as an adult, because who the fuck is gonna care if you gained the rank of High Warlord in PvP? Very few. 
---
Good luck and take care of yourself!
---
Am I the only priest that thinks "wand spec" is overrated? I don't have any points in disc and I barely ever need to drink. You just need to find a good rotation of shadow spells (in combination with wanting).
---
How long does it take to do this and make enough gold
---
Aggro gets lost sometimes.  If they take a few hits, then I just see it as some damage mitigation and then usually get aggro back or at least a taunt.
---
Bad RNG hurts with tanking, but you can usually come back to some degree and fix a pull that goes south.
---
Fury is going to really be better with gear. But you can really level with either and play which one you enjoy most.
---
Yeah I bet they managed to get such a huge stockpile with all the maybe 5 layers a full populated server has. Am I right. Especially considering there are a ton of players who all try to do this.
---
Hahaha
---
I'd say the vast majority are still &lt;30.
---
Awesome, that's a good starting point. Thank you!
---
It's a tribal leatherworking blue helm that gives the 20 energy, but yes.
---
Cool thanks, much appreciated
---
And how do you make somebody equip that 3000g Teebus on the spot? If already 50%+ of the population thinks you are dumb for not rolling need yourself, there will hardly be repercussions for the one actually rolling need and henceforth rolling in gold.
---
Your analogy not mine.
---
It'll be ok, we gamers like to get all upsetti spaghetti but the population of the game is plenty healthy.
---
I wonder aside from skinning is there anything you needed more then 300 to gather or craft?
---
Id like it too haha

Maybe but its pretty unlikely.

Jesus christ dude we get it, you like Asmongold. But what you're saying is just ridiculous, yes he has multiple R1 titles. Have you ever seen doing him arena? Or have you started watching him with Classic release?
---
He used to do arenas on stream more, but kinda stopped doing it on stream and we know why. However few months ago he tried arenas with Mcconnell again and that shit was fucking insane. Attacking straight into Thorns, tunneling his target, fucking up his rotation. CC, interupts, what is that? Multiglad doesn't need that, right?
---
So what he's streaming, he's not the only one, if he was a player who isn't into PvP then sure, I don't expect him doing good on 1.4k. However when you're a multiglad streamer playing on 1.4k and you don't know how Thorns work, that's little bit weird. Interacting with chat has nothing to do with that, but even chat isn't that stupid to not realize he's just boosted. Maybe he would reach 2k alone, however no way he would get glad alone. Everyone who has played PvP long enough can see that. If he was such a good player, he would destroy arenas on lower ranks but he got his ass kicked
---
He just blames every little mistake on everyone else meanwhile not being able to admit his mistakes, he's been always like that and it used to be a funny part of his streaming persona but it's just gotten worse with his ego going up alongside with his viewership, now it's annoying if anything. Like that tournament where he lost to Soda and then blamed it on balance. 
---
Pilav showed him what he did wrong in the video, literally everyone could see those mistakes but Asmongold still didn't want to admit he fucked up and just blamed game balance instead, he blamed fucking game balance as warrior when feral was in absolutely terrible state. He called Pilav a liar when he duelled an actual R1 feral by himself and won. That's just sad, but hey what to expect from a multiglad not knowing how Thorns work. 
---
Yes he's mediocre at best.
---
This also applies to rogues, especially when you go a while without getting a weapon upgrade.

Ya ClassicCodex is great. A few bugs as well though, like quest objectives not loading occasionally, and I just had my first completed quest that wouldn’t show up on the mini map. Other than that though, it’s been much better than questie.
---
ur not really making any reasonable arguments, my point is completely valid. sorry
---
Lol appreciate man
---
Level as arms, 2h, and switch to fury when you have some gear at 60.  Fury (warrior in general) is very gear dependent.
---
This gives me a lot of hope. I honestly could probably live happy playing on a few hundred pop server my entire game life only if I knew if I wanted to, I could switch. Knowing I could never switch would ruin the experience.
---
Kind of like how I abandoned my 20 rogue because I decided I didn't like the haircut, knowing there's no hair changes in WoW. Now, if there were hair changes in classic WoW, I probably would have gotten to 60 before even bothering going to the barber.I would see my hair constantly, it would annoy me, but it wouldn't fill me with dread.
---
The meta?  Yes.  But there's going to be a lot of guilds who are a bit shocked to find out how EASY classic raids (esp. early tiers) really was, and realize you can bring a lot of non-meta, so I think there will be a lot more offspecs raiding than people think.
---
Or maybe I'm crazy.
---
You sparked my curiosity: why would you bank it?
---
So heal me and you drink? You're the support class its your duty to keep the party healthy so they can do their jobs. If the lock is also pulling aggro and dying then yea thats his fault but if you can't deal with just a life tapping warlock then you shouldn't be a healer.
---
This is actually helpfull thanks!
---
How the fuck can a body pillow play WoW you idiot!? /s
---
i thought it wasnt really viable doing SM pickpocketing runs anymore, like i know the numbers of PS were inflated, but i thought it was better to just farm other spots.
---
Because they itch?
---
You can really heal dungeons as any spec, imo wand spec and spirit tap are mandatory, you are gimping yourself if you don’t have those while leveling. After that it’s personal preference, imo the best setup for pre level 40 is getting holy spec, divine fury, holy nova, and eventually searing light. When soloing even as shadow spec you aren’t usually going to be casting mind blast more than once per mob even with points in imo mind blast. You gain benefits to healing cast times and crit while being as fast or faster for soloing as shadow.  Most of the lower level shadow talents aren’t particularly helpful outside of spirit tap. However outside of getting spirit tap and wand spec I think you can really put points into whatever and be fine. I lean towards holy or disc at lower levels because you really need shadow form and other high level shadow talents to get much benefit, especially at low levels stuff like mindflay is just a waste of mana compared to wanding.
---
Both PvP and PvE content (outside of questing), is way more difficult. Stuff like Mythic + dungeons are way beyond anything in classic.
---
A lot of classes just press a single button, there isn't much of a skill gap to speak of.
---
This is just a fact that can be verified in-game.
---

It's the remnants of the cultural revolution mindset where you had to live every single day fighting tooth and nail for every single little thing. In a normal society, it's absolutely toxic on all levels. But I have only pity for them since I see them as victims molded by circumstances into something hideous.
---
lol ur a bit late bro...... still coping?

Choosing a good combo is only feo minmaxing, so id say play whatever you wantåPÖ1
---
There are more efficient ways of grinding gold. There are also less efficient ways. I like fishing cause you can zone out and watch YouTube videos or something while fishing. It also is class independent. So if you are a class that struggles with aeo grinding fishing could be a good choice for you. There are also ways to compound fishing gains if you have other professions, like cooking or herbalism. Free action potions will be in demand for all of classic.
---
That all being said, if you would have more fun grinding humanoids for cloth or trying to find mining nodes, there are other options for gold. That's probably what the other guy was saying is that if you dont enjoy fishing there are other ways to efficiently grind for gold.
---
7 buttons?! Psssh. Stealth and Pickpocket your way to victory. And maybe the occasional vanish.
---
I always inspect the gear of people I meet, it’s nice to pay it forward in this game.
---
Look how the only Horde rebuttal is "I kil yu ez" lol literal 40 IQ horde players.

Yeah it was my analogy, and as I pointed out your post was nonsense.
---
i had ambition like you once, then i took an arrow to the knee.
---
Those Mistvale Gorillas better look out. A real warrior is coming to get them.
---
because it's worth a fuckton, and it willbe replaced soon anyways. the gold later is much more valuable than the stats now.
---
There could be argument for no one being able to need on something like a Krol Blade even if they can use it. I think that item and similar has to be put into a different category.

Lvling your main hand is sword as SS does better easier damage, backstab does big numbers but requires a lot of setup and better suited for dungeons where you have a tank with aggro. Your offhand just needs to be quick to apply poison. Use at your preference/best option.

What if I told you there are jerks on both sides and your faction doesn't determine anything. 
---
Secondly in the video the horde characters weren't attacking or provoking the priest, I only feel the priest did this was because they had like 5 other Ally's on the ship that could back them up if things went awry
---
Could you expand?
---
But you *can* wear it. You sell staff of jordan for 250g, you buy boots of avoidance for 250g. There you just got an item with equal value for the  staff.

As someone who mained an UD Rogue through Vanilla and TBC both in hardcore raiding guilds and in some pretty high-rated arena teams, I can say that WotF is an amazing PvP racial, and, as you've indicated, will let you blow up priests and warlocks with ease.  However, for Classic, I went Orc this time.  Besides wanting to change up the appearance for something new, I liked the idea of getting both a really nice PvP racial in Hardiness, and a really great PvE racial in Blood Fury.  It's fun popping Blood Fury, Blade Flurry, and AR and mowing stuff down.  However, that's not to say that the other UD racials aren't bad - they all provide some nice utility and are not totally useless like throwing weapon specialization.  Cannibalize is nice because it does not share cooldown with bandages and is always nice to eat Alli face after you kill them; +10 Shadow Resistance means you might resist a fear here and there a little bit more than normal; Underwater Breathing is very situational but has bailed me out a number of times when fishing in Azshara when you need to go underwater to escape.
---
I think in Vanilla engineering was not as popular as it will be for Classic, and there will be way more people using grenades regularly that will be noticeable.

We had quest helper and TomTom in vanilla or close enough to it that it doesn't matter. You don't have to rely on it but it's nice to be able to look at your map and say "oh yeah let's go kill this guy while we're up here" instead of forgetting...

Ah I see you have never been in the group that decides to let that guy have the epic BoE world drop because he "needs" it, then you find it listed on the auction house a few hours later by the same guy who didn't even bother to use a bank alt.

You keep talking about the group as if it's some sort of collective or long term association.

You only need a dagger in your main hand for ambush and backstabbing. I would use a sword in my off hand if it was a huge damage upgrade from the dagger I had, but a lot of rogues like the dagger in the off hand because it's super quick and better for poison proc.
---
I actually like this suggestion because it’s not a key bond I would use for an ability but still easy to press
---
This. There's no way u can just throw a blanket statement of real time to get to 60. Everyone plays differently. In game time is the only variable that works for everyone.
---
Sword spec is great for levelling as the talents in the combat tree are good, you find more high quality swords as you level and having higher damage on your mh makes your abilities do more damage.
---
Having a fast oh (like a dagger) is good for proc rates on poisons, that's why a lot of people use a sword and a dagger.
---
You can macro to swap them around for backstab and ambush too.
---
It's not even going to work either. The only people who are going to be tricked into moving there 100+ hours investment from the most popular server to the least popular are the same people who were going to quit a month in away. But they know this, they don't care, this affects individuals on dead servers, not the majority, aka where the majority of their money comes from.
---
You laugh but she is the real winner here.

You can post things to the AH and if no one buys it they’ll mail it back to you where you can let it sit for 30 days I think.
---
I remember stepping into Naxx 2.0 in mostly blues and probably a green or two. I get the sentiment though....
---
I was on when Cataclysm expac was about to go live and everyone was crowding the flight trainer in the city so no one is able to click on them to learn to fly in Eastern Kingdoms/Kalimdor before their buddies do, so one way you could get around that is zoom the camera into first person view and walk inside the crowd. When you got to the NPC, you could easily isolate and click him/her.
---
No, they'll be stuck with massive queues forever. Layering is going away for all servers at the same time.

It’s there. Look for it. Store or something? Dunno for sure, because I haven’t looked.

Totem quests are notorious for this. You have to be very careful with the quest items and ALWAYS let the in game event play out to completion.

Never spam complete quest, give it 2-3 seconds after the window pops up and disable any auto quest turn in add-ons before doing them, otherwise you'll be headed on your way back to the last step of the quest to run halfway around the world again.

Be patient, I know it sucks but it's how it is.
---
The everyone need everyone philosophy is based on 2 principles
---
1 the AH value of the item is equal to the value of equipping it. This means everyone would gain equal value from the item.
---
2 it is ninja proof.
---
Why do yoy believe your way is the proper way. 
---
1 you arbitrarily attribute the item more value to whoever would equip it. If the item is worth more to equip it then it costs on the AH, just go buy it on the AH and gain value equal to the difference. If the item is worth more on the AH, no one should equip it or you lose value equal to the difference. Supply and demand say the item is worth an equal amount to equip or sell on the AH.
---
2. Your method is susceptible to ninjas.

I'm glad you're finally have a good time playing this wonderful MMORPG. I think a lot of retail players thought they were having a good time, but never truly knew what they previously missed.

At the beginning they only had a few servers, so I know a bunch of guilds flocked to those. Whitemane for west coast and Herod for east coast were the two biggies, Faerlina if you want to play with streamers.

---
Yikes, projection is fun.
---
Caught in the gravity well, clearly.
---
You might want to consider if the server has a large community of non-English speakers. Faerlina is the "streamer" server.
---
That character looks familiar... Are you on Myzrael?
---
where can i get this hud my guy
---
lol
---
Not only eating or/and driking, but I am leveling a priest at the same time and let me tell you that I am finding it SO much easier. Ok, Priests need a wand too because they run out of mana pretty quickly but it is soooo much easier. I cant tell rogue because I never leveled one, but I believe you if you say the difficulty is close to warrior's, they have a lot of things in common.  
---
They hit like absolute trucks when they have a good weapon, but the first 30 - 40ish levels are absolute nightmare...
---
Recently saw a Thanos meme with Quilboar in its place, but cant find it anymore. Wanted to send it to a friend. Anyone remembers the thread name?

Good job OP!

If you never play when there's a queue, why would you move?
---
:thinking:
---
I mean I'm not knocking u for changing classes, do what u have fun doing man. Locks just absolutely do NOT have hard times getting into groups.
---
What if I tell you people use some weird loot council and internet DKP instead of just rolling need and greed. Just because there is a window plopping up, you dont need to follow its advise.
---
These videos inspired me to never give up on catching the boat. The other day I tried to jump on the Ratchet-Booty Bay boat as a cheetah, and ended up in the cabin area with the bed.
---
So......why do they buy it if it’s useless.
---
Tbh I'm kinda bummed about mine. I'm on Anathema-US and the population just seems really low. Org feels empty all the time and it's really hard to sell shit on AH. I really like my guild though so I dont want to just reroll
---
Swords are literally better for everything. There are no facets of the game where daggers are ever better. Before level 35 and you don’t have sword specialization (you should level as combat) you can use a dagger in your offhand to proc poison more.
---
Yeah i think you can easily dubbel your income from them through AH
---
Wtf am I hearing lmao
---
Lw and skinning, but i farm so not much gold needed so far. 110 lw though.
---
Lmao, it takes 5 seconds to reply to you, and it's clearly getting under your skin. I've got plenty to do, this is just a fun distraction
---
Its not. If you get the rank 10 pvp set, you’ll be able to compete with anyone that isn’t fully naxx geared (which most players will never be).

That pack your group tried to skip but some straggler pulled begs to differ. Trust me not every MC runs going to be a loot piñata toy think it is.

Agree! First aid is my higher profession at the moment

*Some*body is going to get laid in college.
---
I waited until I was 40 worth mount,but now it’s profession time!
---
Oh god, I thought that was just a notification, because stuck in a queue are more likely to change realms, I didn't realize it was the *only* way to change realms. That's hilariously incompetent.
---
like, we dont need a full group of guildies, lets just pick up a rando

Except by engaging in this prisoners dilemma you're demonstrating your own selfishness because you value your time and instant gratification over group etiquette and consequences for bad actors.

I remember before legion at least when I was at goldshire inn and somebody was giving away 300 gold at a time. Fun times.

My friends and I are playing together and one of us is new to WoW at all so I periodically inspect her gear and make her new stuff. The other day a green dropped and she didnt equip it. Her partner was telling her to equip it and she mumbled something which he repeated, she didnt want to replace something white I'd made her because it said made by my name on it. Bless her heart! We had to explain that she'd level quicker with the green and I'd make her new items later.
---
We are only about lvl 20 but having more fun doing quest together than I thought possible. Last night we managed to kill a tough ogre elite in Loch Modan and it felt like a boss kill! Really loving Classic still!!!
---
Personally I use Details! for all my tracking.  Doesn't have fancy bubbles or anything like that but it is a robust tool.
---
Except I responded to one comment about it. And my ‘argument’ is it’s a game so who cares. We’re not the same.
---
It's called ElvUI
---
Nerds complaining about this just got dunked on hard.
---
in raids, sure.... i assume we're talking rando dungeons here though.
---
If resto had a basic rez I'd play druid again in a heartbeat. I'll probably still level one eventually though.
---
Yikes, you're an idiot. lmfao
---
You’ll probably need to buy the recipe too from a vendor in hammerfel.
---
I just farmed everything in the area I was in. Gained a level just killing crap while trying to finish the quest.
---
Thing is I wasn't trying to change your mind, I couldn't care less if you like Retail or not. I came in simply pointing out an obvious inaccuracy in your criticism, which caused you to launch into a tirade covering everything you hate about retail (however true those criticisms might also be or not).
---
That is ignorant. The fact that you can't accept people have different tastes, even going so far as to say things like *"You can defend retail all you want - there's no accounting for taste"*, when I wasn't defending it in the first place - simply refuting your misconstrued argument.
---
If you're going to criticise something, you should be accurate in your criticisms, or else you simply look like a fool - *that is ignorance*.
---
Most people are hitting lvl 40 now, so the money go there. In a month it will be much better, then you can have, if you don't go on spending spree, enough gold to train everything. Till then though..
---
The run went great, we replaced some people halfway through, only a few wipes, got a good cloak and pants, and a blue staff from quest rewards. Thanks for all the good comments and wishes of luck.
---
You're referring to Windfury totem, I suppose :)
---
But dat xp
---
Yes. The question is whether that will remain the case once layering is removed.
---
No man, no no no, what you want is the ravager.
---
Proc in a crowded room and watch the numbers soar!

Im zeus nibba, bout to catch these hands.

Was going to say this. It’s on the bottom left above add-ons.
---
BFA babies don't like being told the thing they think is hard is actually a tightly compact joke of a raid lol.  It disqualifies their imaginary belief they are good at WoW XD. It's okay man- you're not alone.
---
So they had 100 rage?
---
Which would be pretty unfair if everything else is "nochanges" yet they change that.
---
Cool.
---
You typically won't be picked up for raids unless there is ample space but they can be beasts in PVP once they add battlegrounds in Phase 2.
---
I'm sorry :(
---
This made me lol in public
---
I mean I would generally say I hate 'Dungeon Finder' as well. However, I didn't hate it Pre-3.3 and I would love for the pre-3.3 finder to come back as I feel it was perfect at that point. Helped build groups and get people together, while still requiring travelling (for at least 2 people) and communication with other players.
---
Top tier in PvP.
---
Not so much in PvE.
---
You completely missed what I said though, yes, they are tricking players into moving to least popular servers. No doubt the people staying on the servers are going to have less of a queue. But Blizzard began this under the pretense of "balancing" population in between realms. What about all of those who have already been on the lower pop servers since start? They're being promised new players, but the only players they're getting are going to quit next week anyway.
---
I missed some assignments the first week of class. I learned my lesson pretty quick that I need to do better about watching the assignment calendar. 
---
I, too, suffer from the classic addiction. The butterflies I feel before I leave work to go home and play are all too familiar, and dangerous.
---
Personally, I just deal with it well because I've grown up a lot in the last few years, and I'm excellent at managing my time. I really wish I could play more, but full time job and school take priority. It makes it all the more pleasing when I finally get to play.
---
Poor BfA Worgen Hunter of mine. The sweet little woofer is about to get a model update FINALLY and I've abandoned the poor boy.
---
youd rather have a bad tank than bad mages, i guarantee it.
---
That's the definition of Greed my friend.
---
Shhh you'll break the circle jerk.
---
I’m just thankful there are such reasonable, stable people who definitely don’t take discussions about the game personal enough to slide into my DMs like some desperate frat boy because they’re definitely not mad. 👍
---
Do not underestimate his powers.
---
How old are you guys?
---
Yes it's cheating, but since blizzard is getting paid for every account they allow it.
---
Hit ESC. It'll open a menu with multiple options. Click the one that says system.  Then it's the first tab open. It's called graphics.  Slider is here.
---
Gratz on 40!
---
Ya there is a button, way to yell at the internet over your own stupidity.
---
I'd still rather full BRD than ST
---
Uh i cant remember what they are called. I believe you can farm multiple types of kobolds for them...but at least the kobold geomancers? In elwynn should have a higher drop. 
---
Its basically a consumable that shoots a fireball and since you can farm them they work well for pulling as a pally.
---
Great news if true.
---
Well from here on out I’m rolling with a macro for this that will describe what I posted so far:
---
Always Roll on Chests
---
No “Need” unless you need the item for equipment. No needing on items you cannot equip or that do not meet your spec/class (IE warrior rolling on int gear) unless agreed to by the party prior to the need roll (Hey can I roll need on this int gear, this has more armor than my grey item)
---
In the event a BoE item drops, only Need rolls will be allowed if you can equip the item immediatly. Faliure to equip the item will be considered Ninja looting with intent to sell the item.
---
Loot type: Group loot or master loot with party rolls. Party can vote for the loot type. Party leader agrees to not steal or choose favorites if Master Looter is voteb for.
---
Type “I agree” if you accept the party loot rules. 
---
This way, I don’t see how any GM could deny a report if that is posted and agreed to.
---
Stood literally on top of the copper vein I wanted to mine, killing a wolf or something that had aggro'd on me when I got there.
---
Did that stop the vein from getting ninja'd out from under my feet? No, sir, it did not.
---
The beginning zones are a little crowded right now, and it's a but cutthroat. Stick it out though. I've met several quality peeps on Buccaneer already. Heck, a few were even in character. ;-)
---
If you want to do high-level raiding or PVP, the best guilds are going to be on the biggest servers.  Thats why in Retail all the hardcore raiders/PVPers are on like 5-6 servers too.
---
Ya.. Not okay to make threads about this sorry
---
I know you are new and we've all done this at one point, but it's not a good idea to put all your spells into one macro. There are very few scenarios where this would be as effective as having spells on your bar separately.
---
Are you on a pvp or a pve server?
---
Ideally, your weapon is a stat stick unless someone is in melee range trying to hit you.
---
Big slow weapons tend to help more in pvp because when you have the opportunity for a melee hit, you only have time for one or two and it needs to matter.  Pvp is about burst damage, not sustained.
---
That's why I drop tremor totem.
---
At one point you could sit in front and it would push you
---
39 Hunter so far, no alts
---
I'm ashamed with how far I zoomed in to see it
---
How is a maximum 5g vendor sell equal to that 3.000g Teebus? I would hardly describe 5g as a pile of gold even.
---
This is hilarious but not for the reason you thought
---
I did the same thing this morning for a nelf fishing off the dock. They had white shoulders at level 23, so I went and farmed one more medium leather and made them some Hillman's shoulders. It was so rewarding, it felt like a quest to help, rather than a quest with a reward. The reward was the act.
---
You can sell written letters on the AH??? TIL.. This is amazing for drunk me.
---
Looks like the cover of that Goosebumps novel
---
ROI would be so much lower. If I could level up 5 accounts simultaneously, I’m being 5 times more productive with my time it makes it easier to incentivize the behavior. And these days masking isp is no tall order.
---
Shift space for me
---
I'm happy if it's even close to 50/50, since most servers seem to be horde favored
---
"we have decided to make it a bannable offense for people to pay us 60$ each month"
---
Yup
---
Give me a Classic experience, but a WOTLK story and I will be satisfied lol
---
This is me giving express elevator rides from Barren to Thousand Needles

And I'm talking about PvP where he claims to be extremely good with multiple gladiator titles.

Also what rank 1 parses? Do you realize you can check his parses, like right now? Still absolutely mediocre parses.
---
Thats when you make your own group
---
Do only whiney kids play Alliance? Or do *all* whiney kids play Alliance?

For the Horde, bitch.

My main is also a NElf priest and my alts are a rogue and a warrior haha.
---
Who? I honestly cant remember anyone but Vol'jin doing anything.
---
Nobody runs dungeons for that 0.003% drop chance BoE. They are running dungeons for BoPs.
---
Sometimes the servers have subreddits and discords that you can join. I think you might have luck just googling something like "Herod reddit" as well to bring up reddit threads about Herod, for example. Doing this for Thalnos shows you a reddit thread about Thalnos being the unofficial Brazilian server.
---
Need to replace female Tauren with Gnome
---
This is the dumbest thing I've read today. Thanks for the laugh.
---
I'm pretty sure the sensitive one here is the one crying about flying and retail.
---
The blue post confirms it has no impact on economy and the abuse they can do is lazy farming, sub optimal at best.
---
Well yeah, the Forsaken never made sense to be part of the Horde to begin with. They are obviously and openly evil.
---
I was on board with them being part of the Horde for a while, because the other races of the Horde simply didn't know them. But the following expansions should have been a progress toward the Forsaken being their own faction; with the attack at the Wrath gate during WOTLK being the final part of the complete separation.
---
I'm on ass candy and it seems like there are very few people over level 30 yet.

The primary interact key activates on the corpse right after it dies.  Or you can click in on the right stick to get the mouse cursor, then click it again to right click, and it will loot whatever you have the mouse over.
---
Right? "R" is way too good of a key for spells and shit.
---
ah i see what you're saying, you're right I did misunderstand your original post. i dunno how true it is, though. I think there are plenty of players out there who haven't found their raiding guild yet and mostly play solo who are working on their grind that are good candidates for this stuff. only time will tell, though.
---
That’s beautiful man. Really touching. Thanks for sharing! Truly a joy to read.
---
Yeah, we decided it wasn't worth it about 5 minutes after looking through the water.
---
Did you just quote a Forbes article about wow to justify a technical rebutal? Also I layer may hold as many players as a server did but again that doesn't prove or disprove anything. If I layer holds as many a s a server did it doesn't change the fact that servers have multiple layers. Look at it like this: a Server is a whole pie holding all of the players. Each slice of the pie is a layer and some of the filling(players) might move in between the slices(layers). The whole pie is the capacity of the players and determines the queue times because when you have to much filling the rest is left in a bowl unless some filling is gone form the pie. Now the size of a slice of pie(a layer on today's servers)  can be the same size as a really small pie( a whole server 15 years ago). I can have 50 slices or 0 slices the size of my pie is the exact same. If blizzard increase the size of the pan(increases server cap) then I can have a smaller bowl of excess filling.
---
Oh man, that brings back memories.
---
Most people are never going to be full armor. Frankly, I doubt most people will clear BWL let alone Naxxramas. The player base may be more knowledgeable and more skilled, but that doesn't change social requirements, motivation, and time requirements.
---
I've thought about this a lot, and at first, I assumed that eventually everyone will get everything and get bored, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that most people are frankly not that motivated.
---
You need to drink the Elixir of Giant Growth first

I'm jealous. On my Druid I had a level 11 ask me to run him through Deadmines this morning.

It's called getting hired dumbass
---
I am nearly 20 with 3.5g now, after vendoring and AHing i will hit 4g definitely. So 100g+ by 40 is reasonable. 110 lw though.. Should work on it.
---
TBC was the best version of WoW but Classic is a 9.5/10 still. TBC for raids. WK for classes.
---
Google Trump Alabama Hurricane Sharpie. Been all over the news this week. The guy with the Alabama comment was not saying anyone lives there, he was making a funny reference to recent news since the name of the item is Hurricane, which is probably why someone gave him gold. Sorry for the whoosh comment, I know not everyone follows politics.
---
Been playing rogue for 15 years and I still despise combat. It might be better but seal fate spec is so much more fun. Just lvl til 26 and after you get cheap shot it's much easier to set up backstab and even easier when you get kidney.
---
Make sure to get Distracting Shot at 20 alongside Freezing Trap, though, if you mean to do instances.
---
AoE "Cleave" spam is the cancer of classic.
---
Yeah that isn't stuck is just way more convenient i take it this is your first time to uc.
---
Are you asking how to farm gold as a hunter? Solo Tribute runs and Mara runs are consistent gold at a high clip.
---
Running ZF, 1h drops. Ask if I can roll it for tanking. Promptly informed that "You cannot tank if you are not prot".
---
It's more profitable for blizzard to collect multiple monthly fees from a single user.
---
First, funny troll post. At least, I hope it is. Second if it isn't, ever since I hit Hillsbrad and STV, I've been plagued by Alliance children corpse camping me in groups of 5 or more. When we grouped up and fought back, they lost and didn't come back until they had some ?? players come help them out. If you don't like pvp or ganking, go to a different realm.
---
It costs money and you'll have to start from 1 on the new skill, but other than that no.

Back in WotLK my friend, shaman, would cast water walking on people in our group after we finished the last boss in Utgarde Keep, so when they jumped down the shaft to leave faster they would hit the water and die. He would also duel people with his DK and if he won, he would cast Hysteria?(which ever spell did like 1% hp per sec for the dmg buff) on them to kill them. It was asshole-ish, but hilarious.
---
You are also being naive as fuck if you don't believe people noticed (+46 group bonus) instead of (-33 raid penalty)
---
You didn't even check if it was posted did you
---
People aren't dropping 3,000 g for anything with the market this flat.   3,000g will make you 10,000g in a year.  And you think that someone will just buy 3 epics mount instead.

Me - “That’s not true! I left at 10 and I had no.... oh, I’m a lock. Carry on.”

I'd guess they kicked someone quickly to get you in instead.

Horde on the server Whitemane
---
Better again, where do I see even my generic crit chance? I quite sure in vanilla it was by just hovering with the mouse on the agility stat but in classic it seems hidden.
---
For spell, it was by hovering on the int stat in your character screen.
---
I believe you meant “right between troll and Tauren starting area[s]” - trolls and orcs share the same starting area.
---
Rogue here, its rough when you're solo levelling.

Correct, without putting (Rank X) it will cast the highest rank spell!

This is my server. Never had a problem but I’m EST playing on PST server while gaming in the morning.

you're not even asking an actual question. wowhead has all that shit with the drop rates and the mobs it drops from, as far as "of the owl" or "of the bear" it's all random with an equal chance for anything

ITS OKAY TO BE WHITE
---
&gt;Killing other players is the point of a PVP server. So, no, it's not a dick move to do that.
---
And therefore by extension, so is attacking them, be it a slap with a sword, a poly or MC, the act of killing a player means they have to do a corpse run, perhaps if the player  was level 60 and just outright ganked the player on the boat, that would had been better than a short swim?
---
&gt;I can tell you when I won't: when they're afk. I also won't bother if the goal isn't to kill them. I'm not going to waste my time with pathetic shit like MC'ing people off a boat.
---
Ah, how honourable, I went away for a minute, left myself in Wetland on the road away from mobs came back dead, I assumed a mob got me then I noticed the chat and players moaning about a level 49+ horde checking the logs, I was murdered while AFK, sorry to say the enemy players will not care if you are AFK or not, you're an enemy to them.
---
&gt;You think I'm crying because I'm pointing out that something is a dick move? Uh whatever works for you I guess. lmao
---
Well, you seem invested within this topic, and your moaning because you were likely MC from a boat, why else would you be so annoyed about such a thing?
---
Check if it really is Orc BiS, if yes, then hold for some time, otherwise just sell it.  
---
There are some 60's with the mount already, so people have waaaaay more than 250g, like more than 10 times more, and I'm not even talking about begger streamers.
---
Why would I care
---
Sit on it,  market will settle,  there's people who'll buy it when you choose to sell
---
Randos can be really nice too though. One gave me better gear for free! Others actively helped me with quests instead of instantly dumping me when they were done with the loot/kills.
---
Since im new to the game randoms are all I meet and its been a good experience so far

classicdb.ch is my preferred personally

Perhaps the queues have already died down and will continue to die down.

Either works but he had a large list of people who would invite him as soon as he cleared his big pulls

Best option is to pick something and try it. You might not like your first pick. In vanilla I started rogue and changed to hunter in my 20s. Played that hunter in every raid in vanilla, pvped like crazy, did the rhokdelar quest and have mained it in every xpac since then. Wouldn't have tried it if I stuck with the rogue which I picked at the time cause I heard it was the best pvp. Fell in love with the hunter class and never looked back.
---
2nd account to farm ah when you do dungeons. A lot of downtime drinking, is enough time to scan ah
---
**Nailed it??**
---
I started with mining and skinning, but found mining to waste too much time for the money it provides right now. It might change later on in the game when more and more players change to more useful professions (not resource gathering) like engineering or alchemy etc, but I dropped it.
---
You can also just make an alt, spend two mi utes running it to a mailbox, and do that for far, far cheaper and with faster turn around.
---
In retail yeah but in classic no. Succubus does like double the imps damage, but the imp provides a bunch of buffs.
---
It's been reduce raid xp since one of the first patches in beta or release. I was always turning down invites to 10 man dungeon groups cause that was never the way to lvl in wow except in an early incarnation.

Actually the roll need on everything practice stems from pug raids. In pug ZG runs stuff drops all the time like bijous, BoEs etc. and several addons even included the automatic need roll, because nobody wants to care for loot drama and everybody wants to get through that dungeon, therefore everybody rolls need (or makes the addon roll need). This seeped into dungeons.
---
you may know the price of training 2 handed axes?

Did they confirm they would change that in later phases though? I thought I had read they were keeping it as is.

Yep, after this I thought I'd try and go for another and save it to sell on AH for mount money later, severely underestimated how rare they actually are.

 I didn't see this below, so apologies if this is a repeat post. I wanted to bring up the issue of Shadow Priest Mana Management in Classic, particularly during raids. For those who are new to WoW or to Classic in particular, Shadow Priests in raids (can) go OOM so fast that the boss fight hasn't even gotten to the first mechanic before they are stripped down to using wands. In subsequent releases, Vampiric Embrace allows for raid-wide mana regen as well as health regen, but Classic just has health regen. 
---
So, what strategies have people used to still have decent DPS while maintaining mana? I've considered possibly using lower ranked spells to conserve mana, but how much lower have people gone? Mind Flay is already super low cost, so my thought is to maintain that one at the highest rank, and go down ranks for Mind Blast and SW:P. Anyone tried this in actual combat? Was just curious before I took a lot of time doing it at a lower level since I'm not yet at max level...
---
Earth shock is actually notorious, kinda like lifetapping warlocks. Since it's the best shock to use while leveling, lot of dumb shammies just default to it and throw aggro everywhere as a result.
---
Tremor totem for that aoe sleep in BFD is nice.
---
Sunder is a huge DPS increase if it lands. I'll spend the extra 5 rage for that.
---
Warlocks destroy in world pvp and general pvp they are a ton of fun
---
You are full of shit and in denial.
---
Retail is a load of fun in its own right. It’s just a different game compared to Classic. I thoroughly enjoy both.
---
I try to go everytime. Except for pool parties. Wtf still have pool parties in their late 20s?
---
I had downloaded the real wow and not the classic version
---
Right I can just go to wowhead and look for lvl42 bear and get its drop table, but looking for actual brackets for global drops, these items drop for these level ranges at these rates and a better understanding of the drop table as a whole.  Someone else posted the table so there’s the answer
---
I tried one of these but it didn't work and someone in the thread said it's the "wrong one" but didn't post the right one.
---
Yes I thought about this too
---
Actually diablo 3 was poorly received because it had too many wow mechanics lol
---
I guess you played pirate servers instead of classic
---
Warlock was my favourite class from Vanilla. I’m resisting playing it again to have a new experience. 
---
Have fun with the pvp. It was my favourite
---
Dang. I never tried it myself but read about it and thought it seemed like a good idea
---
Ok...... but if you did other zones before coming to Westfall, you could reasonably level there until level 18
---
what can i do to join ?
---
ok. You keep telling yourself that. I'll laugh when you get pissed the piece you want is needed and sold in AH all because you assumed everyone else in game is a giant dick too
---
One of the funniest movies of all time
---
It’s paid for, it’s not against TOS. I don’t have much time to level so worth every cent.
---
I think it’s 10s across the board except polearms
---
Spirit is good to stack pre40. Make sure to use a slow two hand. Either group or stick to green mobs and quests. Level first aid. Always have 20+ food.
---
Omg.... Nostalgia kicked in.....
---
Damn I didn’t know that I will have to check it out.
---
Jesus you're gonna be the richest man on the realm come phase 3
---
This is missing the Pirates of the Caribbean song.
---
I heard hamstring kiting doesn’t work at all anyways because of melee leeway. Is this true?
---
Yes, because the 5g is worth as much as 1.200g. This is a more realistic price as titans flask will actually sell for that much as guilds will want to be able to craft flasks autonomously from the getgo and the Drakki flask is the hardest to obtain)
---
Twitch mate!
---
Gold Sellers, mess with AH addons
---
I see mage casting frostball to tag mob - run and tag before the mage.
---
Also sometimes I bring mobs under aoe of other players.
---
Smoothbrain redditors will downvote your post
---
Items like that should be treated as currency given how extraordinarily rare and valuable they are, if for no other reason than to protect yourself from getting ninja'd
---
Does everyone in the group "need" 100g? Press need.
---
Or don't. And get ninja looted by someone with the more reasonable mentality
---
Bring on the downvotes
---
Blizzard does not in any way police your system. They have never and will never ban anyone for being a ninja using the need greed system as implemented. They have implemented a system if used perfectly, would be fair. But it is not used perfectly, and no one will enforce it.
---
Your camp is the one making these arbitrary calculations. Is the item an upgrade. Is it more of an upgrade for me or you. Does the fact that I have to wait a level to equip it change its value. Does the fact that you get a class quest upgrade this level affect it. You are adding in so many random variables.
---
There is no calculation to be done on our side. It is valued at its AH value which is equal to the value of equiping it. It is worth exactly the same amount to everyone. Period.
---
Let me know all the criteria you are using to calculate who needs it and who doesn't. Are all of those even checkable inside the game, or have we just added another later of trust and a failure point.
---
If everyone rolls need, everyons gets a fair chance at an item worth exactly the same amount to everyone.
---
Whoever wins it gains it value in AH gold. The act of equiping it exchanges that value.
---
The day Blizzard will introduce breath bar to pets, you will thank us too.
---
Heeeelllll yeah
---
didnt know there are priest gnomes
---
again, if its agreed upon before you go, by all means, need away.  I'd never raid if i didn't know what the loot rules are.
---
I guess I'm just too old.  Too long in the tooth.  Some guild doing something quickly means nothing.   The game is about me, and my experience.  Not theirs.
---
Tanks who go apeshit after losing threat need a slap in the face. I've tanked every dungeon since I started playing and frankly it's rare for me to easily hold aggro on every mob in a pack. It's just how it is with limited tools and threat being a much bigger factor. You will lose aggro now and then on packs of mobs, learn to deal with it (Ideally with hamstring, demo shout or taunt or sunder spam).
---
I just downloaded Auctioneer so I know if the AH is the same price as vendor so I don't waste my time posting. Thank you!
---
The only times I can really kill a warlock consistently is if I stealth and catch them off guard.
---
/bow 
---
“as we both charge... changing  places awkwardly” 😬
---
Ret Paladin ran past the tank for every trash pull and manages to aggro the next pack every single time. Then proceeds to focus fire on every mob except the one that's marked and get attacked.
---
Finally the tank had enough and asked him to slow down and focus his fire only for the Ret Pally to say "it's your fear that keeps pulling the whole room".
---
The tank decided to kick him and I don't blame him.
---
I'm speaking in general.  Every time wow has done this "transfer from a fi server to a new server!" thing it's ended up this way.   Most people don't move thibking others will leave, and the few that do leave are on an empty server.
---
Yeah. You're probably right. Still, not "r".
---
This is the entire reason I rolled a Tauren. Love their culture. Very aware of themselves and others. Chill af and down to hang, but if you cross the line they can throw some hands. Hard.

44 War here, still on rank 1 of a lot of things.  I got my mount as soon as I hit 40 because I realized it wasn't worth 3g to do 10 more damage every time I got an Overpower proc.
---
I'm level 21, and feel like my Spirit Tap (rank 5) never procs in Deadmines and some times does not while questing. Is there an internal cooldown or am I just not understanding the talent?

Spot on. Along with literally every leader of any Nation ever, but yes, spot on.

I have become the man that teaches the warriors in my guild to tank, so for any warriors new to Vanilla; Battleshout is the best threat generator you can use in a dungeon. It may not say it on the tooltip, but it generates 55 threat per ally hit. Please, please, PLEASE use it more often.

Personally, I bind it to my mouse scroll so I can just keep rolling the wheel and keep all the mobs on me.

14.73% drop chance of -Herod from Scarlet Monastery Armory
---
I googled it and realized you were in fact the wrong one
---
You can extend that to weapons, those lvl &lt;= 10 give around one lesser essence each, the ones lvl 11 to ~20 give greater essences. A good amount of weapons are sold for like half their disenchanting value.
---
The real infinite money source is linen cloth -&gt; bags -&gt; vendors. It's profitable if you buy the cloth at &lt;= 28c. Yesterday I bought litter ally thousands of cloths at 20c max, I could have got far more but I got tired of crafting.

There isn't really a certain slot to prioritize - if you have a reasonable bit of money, just check the auction house for all slots every time you go back to a capital, just in case there's a great deal on there.
---
It used to count as ground when they hit the water at the bottom and die.
---
Damn!! That’s crazy
---
Heal is more mana efficient than Flash Heal so you want to use it more often if possible.
---
I try and time it so my Heal will go off when it will heal the tank back to full hp without over healing. 
---
If one of my party members are dropping quick, I'll throw a bubble on them then flash heal them up quick.
---
If a tank has no problem tanking, I'll throw a renew on him and then start dpsing with my wand.
---
As a Tauren I didn't do these quests, I got there and did the quest that required me to steal the innocent blood so I could bring peace to Stonetalon but the rest of the quest didn't feel right to do as a tauren and I'm not even an RP player

I’ll even ask in deadmines:

“we rollin in engie crates?”
---
9/10 runs its “naw go for it”
---
can you define “high level raiding or pvp” for me? 
---
Cause unless you’re trying to get server first/world first clears for raids, i don’t see the point. You will most definitely be able to find groups for all raids as they come out regardless of server pop. You’ll even be able to find premades for pvp. so i guess i just don’t understand the appeal of waiting 3 hours to play. If you’re an asmondgold fanboy or something, i can understand that.
---
Okay yes that's a good point. As a druid I try to help when I can but sometimes it's too much especially if it's 3+.
---
Classic codex might let you look it up in game

Or carnival row on amazon which is low key pretty awesome
---
oh yeah lol I thought this was /r/grobbulus when I posted
---
Show me on the doll where the alliance touched you
---
omg wow. thats so idk what to say that. what dungon was this in.
---
&gt; As far as I can tell, Rockbiter and Flametongue does not scale with gear.
---
Rockbiter doesn't scale, Flametongue scales if you get any +Fire or +Spell damage gear. The coefficient is 10%, so if you have +10 Fire damage, it increases your Flametongue damage by 1.
---
&gt; 3) At the current version of WoW classic, what's the mechanics for Windfury? I assume WF procs can't proc more WF procs. But does it have a "cool down" thus making slower weapons better?
---
The cooldown was added in Burning Crusade.
---
&gt; 4) Rockbiter solely adds attack power, aye? Which makes you hit harder, but no increased chance to hit, AFAIK?
---
Rockbiter doesn't increase your chance to hit.
---
Craft professions are worth it if you are ahead of the pack or atleast in the top percentile. I've probably made over 200g from blacksmithing. Just by buying rare materials and craft them into better products which translates into 300% profit. Being ahead means less competition so you can basically dominate the market more easily.
---
I spent an hour getting a group together for uldaman and waiting for everyone to get to the dungeon. We were buffing to start and my laptop crashed. I rebooted and was back on within 5 minutes. They replaced me immediately.
---
Best wow claasic comment so far
---
Play what you want to play. Tanks are always going to be in short supply. It’s easy for classes with healing abilities to heal a dungeon. But for tanking all we have is warriors and druids and the occasional shaman. So the list to pull from is much smaller.
---
Oh... duh lol.  Thanks 😅
---
“edwuuurdddd” “bwrothewrrrr”
---
IMO you should replace it with cat yodeling instead.
---
Not if it literally doesnt benefit you. Your putting this as if everu blue that drops is an upgrade for anyone/everyone.
---
I know the main Scarlet Monastery quest isn't in Phase 1. My guildies are pretty sure the ST class quests are not too.

---
I mean it's equally stupid no matter which side it's aimed at. But fuck it, I'm gonna upvote it anyway, because Horde.
---
Sweeping strikes + Windfury + Whirlwind should just be called " Aoe Taunt"
---
I mean, you're questioning yourself so at least you're in the right headspace: you want to do the right thing.
---
I guess, in AITH format, I'd say YTA. I personally decline group invites for drop quests (collect X of Y, not named mobs obviously) because it only makes things slower for everyone. If you didn't like him taking spawns you should probably be upset with the spawn rate and not the guy who just wants to get the quest over with.
---
But, again, you're questioning it and wondering if you did the right thing, so I'm not saying you're irredeemable I just think you did the wrong thing in this situation.
---
for the record my worst story far has been well quite a frankly we had a preist who decided half the time rather then heal me as the tank he would dps even when my hp was really low.
---
Repaired gear vendors for more, usually for more than the amount it costs to repair it.
---
that feel when ur parents never loved u but now ur a shaman in classic wow and u can earthshock quest mobs and force people to wait around for 5 minutes
---
Seems to not be in phase 1. Questie Shows the quest at my warrior class Trainer. But no quest there. Same for my mage buddy.
---
Overpower is actually a very minor upgrade. At 28, you probably have an autoattack damage, if you are well armed, of 150+. With strike of the hydra, I think I was more like 165-175 average after I got ridiculously lucky in BFD and got martyr's chain, algae fists, and strike of the hydra in 2 runs. 
---
So it makes overpower about 6% better. Now, I still get it, as that's what I am all about as warrior. 6% more for only 2 gold? I can see if you might rather spend that money on a nice piece of gear or your professions, or just buying a large quantity of high quality food and not using level 15 (no buff) food at level 30.

As a warrior tank, if I get a shaman that’s a few levels above me in my group I just whisper them and tell them that they’re officially tanking
---
As a hordie that played a human paldain for 5 levels I can confirm, first class quest makes  you suck the trainer just to access it
---
No!
---
Eh. Even as a former Gladiator, the only reason I'm on a PvP server is because my friends are. I think PvP belongs in battleground and arena instances where it's a more consistent challenge, not in the open world where it devolves into whoever has the higher level friends.
---
It's not fun to get killed and worse camped by players 10-20 levels above you when all you are trying to do is fish. There's some courtesies players should afford each other and some players do, but too many live by the "if it's red it's dead" creed. That's not fun for the guy on the receiving end unless he kicks your ass for trying, and even then it gets old. Personally, I've got better things to do.

Used to do a bit of web design back in the day as well, so I'm pretty familiar with HTML and CSS.  (Although kinda rusty.)  My 2 main interest were Python and JavaScript.  I've read that Python is great for a beginner, or someone who wants to get back into the swing of things.  And JavaScript is the route to take if you want to land a gig.  I'll start out with Python and hopefully go from there.

Appreciate the reply!
---
If your tank is chain-pulling you only have to hit 1 out of every 4 or 5 mobs to get some benefit out of Spirit Tap.  If you configure your UI to show target of target, just look for a low health mob and hit it with your wand once or twice.
---
What level was your run? Bears only realistically have 3 moves sub 30. Swipe, which hits like a wet noodle, demo roar and maul, which like heroic strike applies to your next auto attack. 
---
If they’re lucky the group is patient enough for them to pull outside of bear form so they can pre hot themself for extra threat
---
wow lame! thats so urgh.
---
Love the satire in this! +1 for you!
---
I've been in the same situation, especially when leveling in the barrens with those crazy long respawns on the numerous named mob kill quests you need to do. More than once I'd ask for an invite, not get one, then when I snipe the mob first with sinister strike because it's instant, the invites come flying in. Usually I'll just accept the invite and let them get their credit but one time on the quest for a named quillboar (I forget his name), I definitely didn't and just strutted off into the sunset with my quest completed.

It’s not though, your argument was totally wrong. You can’t vendor a bop item and buy a equally good item for your class, but you CAN sell a boe and do that.

Yeah I'm using ElvUI, but a bunch of addons that i use in retail without this issue. its super strange
---
The game has always lacked tanks.  That is why every class that has come out since vanilla comes with a tanking spec (DK, Monks, Demonhunters).
---
What SM quest are you referring too.

To the curb, with them!

No it occurred to me after you may have mistaken what I was saying

Looks like it was Questie? but I haven't seen anyone else with this kind of spam - is it some sort of option?
---
So if you play ally you participate in a dick-sucking conference?
---
They generate a ton of threat from their damage in early level dungeons
---
Oh I understand it, I just don't trust these other fuckwits around. That's why I just roll last.
---
Honestly not sure offhand. Ordered it many months ago from an etsy like site.
---
Clicking need should auto-bind that item to your character IMO.
---
Since it doesnt though, i agree. Everyone needs on big ticket BoEs. Only way to prevent a ninja
---
Oh ok so pug tanks are trash got it thanks
---
They may merge some servers but it will only be after quite some time.
---
Why is that douchy? It means 5 people would get it instead of just 1.
---
So then why, as you stated, do they need people to leave overpopulated servers before they can remove layering?
---
Nope I mean you are literally a social justice warrior.
---
Moonfire + a hand that did the Metal Gear Solid torture scene without turbo
---
Disc can be a fantastic leveling spec.  I take shadow to imp. Pain and throw the rest into disc on vanilla and now in classic.  It’s a really fun spec imo and you will have no problems leveling.  
---
I’m also doing my first pvp server and I think the above is especially true on pvp realms.

Now do it again without abusing the glitch that gives you extra ball on the board at the start that everyone denies knowing about

---
I only ever dabbled in Everquest a little bit when I was young but I remember the EQ players calling WoW casual though. I'm not saying Vanilla is the hardest most punishing game ever, but it has it's challenges.
---
We honestly don’t know. The value of gold is changing and you won’t know what the actual price is for sometime which is why people can’t give you a number. At the moment the axe is probably worth 250g, like the offers say, but in 2 months it could be much more. The economy is still getting established and people are still growing their fortunes. Almost everything bought now is gonna be cheaper. For example the butcher (a twink item) is going for like 8g on my server atm, but I know that it can probably be sold for 30g to 50g (depending on the economy of the server) in a months time
---
WHOA GOOD ONE BRUH
---
renew, use different ranks of Heal depending on health missing as to not overheal, wand in the mean time
---
A corpse run is punishing? Baby's first MMO right here
---
It really does. Make friends with a lot of mages!
---
Great pic!
---
So you could buy two items with the gold you get from that one amazing item. If this item is so good, why hasn’t the person who needs it farmed the gold for it outside group settings? Everyone else in the group is basically being punished because that one person hasn’t farmed gold. You can’t farm BoP items outside a group.
---
But theyre outdamaged by dps casters, the only people the need to protect lol.
---
Like the hulk on a pony
---
For some ppl that might not understand: try to die with those sweet op spells.
---
\&gt; Yeah I very much miss zones like the barrens that are just a big flat spread out space. Modern zones are these winding maze like areas where everything is tightly packed together and you have to follow the intended path 
---
I heard that same point made in a recent podcast. The modern maps are much more dense in terms of content, which is completely unnecessary and removes the sense of "vast expanse" from the world.
---
From your own link lol.
---
&gt; **UPDATE:** Blizzard officially confirmed the exploit to be fake. They're actively monitoring layering and all realms have been confirmed to only have a single-digit number of layers.
---
I rarely praise FFXIV but one of the things I like is that the mandatory main story quest forces you to run most of the outdated dungeons and raids in the game.  Those raids are populated with max level characters who do daily queues to earn badges for welfare epics.  The leveling character gets to see all of the old content and max level players have a reason to run obsolete raids and dungeons.  You even get a bonus for having a first timer in your group so it fosters a good spirit of veterans wanting to help newbies.
---
It would be like if in retail when you hit 60 you had to run Ony, MC, and BWL before you could go to TBC and the raids were mostly full of timewalking lvl 120's.  It's a great way to keep old content relevant.
---
Lol, what? We are in patch 1.13, the Classic version of 1.12.
---
But the sunken temple class quests were added in patches that’d match with phase 3 or 4, if they aren’t adding them in phase 1.
---
Zalazane, all the other ones I thought of weren’t actually Darkspears. Whoops. 
---
And you could argue Zalazane wasn’t a ‘big bad,’ but he does have some lore behind him and for the trolls he’s def a bad guy
---
And also bow training if you’re a hunter. 
---
From my understanding, a lot of the better ranged weapons for hunters at higher levels are bows rather than guns
---
Usually going shadow is better for leveling and you still can heal in dungeons if you ever need it.
---
I'm level 20 and I already have...

If you want to group, find me &lt;Mortaran, human warlock&gt;  As long as I get exp, and we can either work on the same thing or alternate between your quests and mine (example, im on stage 2 of killing Westfall defias... Ill help you do stage one from scratch).  
---
If you just want to find a grind spot, and grind away a level, I am not afraid to do that either....  I would rather get exp playing in a group, then be "master quester" solo.  
---
Thats all the rant I on that topic.
---
Yea looks a little suspect from that pic, you cannot really see the details that make it look less chinballsy. :)

Oh really? I thought there was a blizz post saying it was all good.

Which is only because they increased the server sizes even more and everyone is divided into more layers... there wont be a mob left alive once layering is phased out.

You should roll need on the krol blade as a priest, and as a warrior i would enthusiastically congratulate you if you won, because the reality is i was going to do the exact same thing with it that you will, go sell the dang thing. Hell even if stockade pauldrons dropped, and you won the roll, i still wouldn't have any hard feelings, even though i fully intend to be our guild raid MT, because I wasn't expecting them to drop anyway, its just RNG. Sure, it would be nice to just win them in a lottery, but it's not going to kill me to buy them, and I'll be funding that purchase partially with other boes that i have won the rolls on.
---
Flying mounts had no problem because it was isolated to that continent and the continent was built with flying mounts in mind. The issue was them bringing flying mounts to the old zones. TBC still kept all the attunement quests but it did start the daily quest grind. Vanilla had a lot of flaws that TBC fixed so even if they introduced a couple negatives that expansion fixed most of didn't feel complete in vanilla.
---
Have not read the thread there is over 100 links to these events. Put some effort in to know what happening around you, don't rely on others to tell you. That is how fake news gets started.
---
I fell victim to this but only once and it wasn't too the horde flight path. First time going into Booty Bay, first time walking into the Bar to pick up the several quests available and a Night Elf Hunter is standing square smack right on top of a quest giver I need to talk to. And because you have to right click in classic WoW to open up the quest dialog, I smacked that NE hunter with my sword. He was like 10 levels below me and I actually got a sword spec proc that crit and I took half his health off. I knew instantly what I had done and I made my peace with the guards. It was a very retrospective corpse run.
---
1. Because the item isn’t guaranteed, and the obtained item is a rare chance.
---
2. Because selling value isn’t standard, so you have no way to directly compare
---
3. A BoE that lasts through man or all the phases like the warden staff is worth more than multiple smaller upgrades because it will not be replaced.
---
For a caster it's really just a stat stick. Whatever has better int / spirit is what you should use
---
That's clearly a scale-mail bikini.
---
Shat wrath? Is that what you call your evening after Chipotle?
---
Or you play with idiots
---
Fair enough.  I'm not up to speed on hunters at all.
---
Ok, let me take each of your points paragraph by paragraph. 
---
1. Nobody said anything about wanting blizzard to police or ban people, I explained it's how blizzard built and intended the system to be used. Nice strawman.
---
2. No calculations required, just a base is x numbers higher than y. You don't need to determine who does or doesn't get it because the game has a way to do that for you, it's called the need/greed system, but people like you interfere with it.
---
3. There are calculations to be done since you have to put it up for some gold price, look at what's up in the AH, see if it's selling for that, see if others go for a lower price, possible wait for the demand to go up and list it later. The list goes on and on. 
---
4. Again, we don't need to look at the criteria beyond, "is it better than my gear?" If yes, need, it's that simple. 
---
5. If everyone needs them the people who CAN use it and get more value out of it have a chance of not getting it, destroying the whole point of the system. 
---
6. I've already explained in a previous comment how AH value DOES NOT equal equip value.
---
Now that I've gone over everything let me simplify it all down into one short little sentence that's easy to understand.
---
If the items gold value EVER affects your decision between Need or Greed, then your answer will ALWAYS BE GREED.
---

Didn't say anything against that. Also, check the recent blue post on this topic.

\- Try to spam BS to generate AoE threat, 2 other Melee in range but the other Warrior's put points into Booming Shout or Improved Battle Shout and you can't buff people for threat, and the 2 casters are out of range to get buffed so you're only getting 1 person's worth of threat for your AoE. 
---
\- Being Power World: Shield'ed on pull.
---
\- People chain pulling for you, keeping you in combat so you can't even try to stop the pain with Charges and Tactical Mastery. 
---
This has been my life every dungeon so far, it's beyond frustrating. Did a dungeon where a Feral kindly offered to tank and hey, look at that, he can get some AoE threat with Swipe while not being screwed over every pull.
---
The red eyes are certainly realistic for me in the morning the last couple weeks.
---
This is correct
---
Not a social issue but my very first classic dungeon run was deadmines as a healing priest. We had another priest, 2 warriors, and a rogue. It took us forever to clear up to VC at which point the tank pulled and got 2 shot. His armour was broken. He hearthed to repair. His hearth was still set in Darnassus. We collectively decided to give up. 
---
That run seriously made me reconsider rolling a healer if we could barely keep 2 warriors alive with 2 priests. Turns out i just needed to stop trying to heal like in retail and make use of the 5 sec rule. Also a group with proper dps helps a fuck ton.
---
Definitely boobs.
---
And even then. Elves are just trolls changed by the sunwell or something like that

Is it possible to show party hp/mana numbers with an addon not changing the original frames?

---
Run about 8 mobs overtop of some rando drinking.
---
You're weapons are just stat sticks as a priest, you don't actually use them
---
You're wand however is very important for leveling, keep upgrading it to the best of your ability as you level.
---
Did you know that ogre casting animations are same as boomkin?
---
I regret to inform you, due to layers, the devilsaurs have not been monopolized by a mafia.
---
Removing flying from WotLK might be a lot of work tough, as the last two zones and a lot of later quests rely on players being able to fly.   
---
At least the zones of "Storm Peaks" and "Ice Crown" would have to be redesigned entirely to make it work without flying.
---
What annoys me the most is when two people are standing by a quest mob spawn, and I ask them if they have room and they say no.
---
Like, it's just the two of you.  I don't see five people all waiting.  If they ain't here, boot them and invite me, or I'm going to tag your quest mob.

Pretty much.

Hahaha I made one of these once and it said "It appears somebody has used this piece of paper to wipe their butt"... I put it on the marker and it sold for 1 gold
---
In terms of the journey, I think it's mostly for accessibility. If you want something crafted, you can do it yourself. However since the game is still very popular, you won't have much trouble to find an actual high level blacksmith and give him the mats so he can craft all your stuff. If you want something fun and useful, you should probably pick up engineering instead of BS tho. I didn't find BS super useful while leveling because you need to keep up with the levels or you won't able to craft gear suitable for your current level.
---
Anyway since mats are still cheap on every servers, engineering won't totally bankrupt you.
---
You could just reroll a new toon on a new server and leave your warrior on Herod. You're not going to be able to keep your human and role a horde on the same server, assuming you're staying on a PvP server that is.
---
Then I guess I'm in the minority of actually planning on using any world drops or BoEs.  If I roll 'need' it's because the group decided or I'm going to use it.  Seems the old way of being courteous in dungeons with loot died with Vanilla.
---
I can absolutely assure you I did. I'll give you a 1st. Edition copy on Flamelash if you'd like!
---
That all depends on context though. Classic healing is all about being as efficient as possible. You want to dps while you regen mana (wanding or melee autoing. Catweaving even at higher levels). You typically only want to heal when absolutely necessary with your biggest mana efficient spell followed quickly by HoTing and maybe topping off a dps before you return to regen mode. Gotta make use of the 5 sec rule or stop after every pack to drink. Overhealing is to be avoided at all costs. You want to aim to slightly under heal.
---
 Now if you were actually dying thats a problem and heals should be on top of that (as a priest my go to is Shield, charge big heal in emergencies. Dont use shield at the start of combat it fucks with Rage generation).
---

Holy fuck I feel this everybody in the group was hyping us up because we had 2 mages and me, paladin specced deep ret with ravager. Procs twice a run
---
quick mods are sleeping post ur edgiest posts LUL
---
Character gender is purely cosmetic so it's all a matter of personal preference. Or can you clarify what exactly you're concerned about?
---
Everyone switching to horde for ezmode is why there is a problem in the first place.
---
I mean could be, but I was just saying that was his actual guild name, not just a joke. Sorry if that was confusing.
---
i do this when i have only 1 or 2 mobs to kill and i feel bad to leave the group and i am to lazy to help the other guy.

tldr i wanna be fast af boy
---
I did know this. Don't ask how I know.
---
well that wasnt very cash money of them
---
Pardon the pun, but, wow.
---
I'm so glad I didn't roll a healer to start.
---
Botting is for sure profitable even with a few accounts.
---
Have you actually read the shaman abilities?
---
Rockbiter grants vastly increased threat for melee autos.
---
Earthshock has vastly increased threat. It's basically a taunt.
---
Pre-20 or so shaman have the best threat gen in the game.
---
I prefer to separate the two, as it means i can change targets without using hunter's mark all the time. I change targets often. You can include it no problem though.
---
Rattlegore
---
whats melee leeway?
---
He did use his talent points right?
---
My problem would be when I use shift modifiers for skills while moving. I'd enable the auto run by mistake constantly.
---
Imagine brandishing your big troll toes on the busy auction house floor and some rushing tauren steps on them
---
Rattlegore is high pop but never has a que, I love it.
---
I don't mind the ganking at all. I mean, it's a PVP server, exactly what I signed up for. But, I'm wondering, as horde, do you feel you have lots of people surrounding you and questing along with you? Right now, I'm in Ashenvale and it feels almost like a ghost zone.
---
I like the fact that there are green items that are stupidly good
---
This isn't really a "go to this zone at this level" it is more of where you will find yourself at different levels.
---
There really isn't anything to do in Stonetalon as Horde after 25 or so, but you do come back to do another quest from Thousand Needles. And for Thousand Needles, it is more of a 25-30 and then 35-40 zone.
---
Animals? The best part is a tree, movement speed reduction and all
---
My favorite mace is the stoppable force. Knock dem bitches down. I know its not an axe but that mace with mace specced warriors oh lawt

My wife thinks videogames are stupid, but she doesn't mind me playing WoW or whatever else I want to play. She makes fun of me for it, sure, but it's not a problem. I make fun of her for having a dedicated Instagram account that she posts pictures of our dogs on and talks in "their voice". And she thinks I'm weird for talking to strangers in the internet...
---
Horde can start Thousands Needles at 25.
---
The difference now is that you are gonna have a harder time finding a dungeon group to level up with if you're not:
---
Mage
---
Tank
---
Priest
---
Guess I'm running to Grom'Gol today

I like leveling cooking. I had 2 stacks of now underleveled food. First lvl 15 I found I gave them to :) he was a happy pally.
---
I quit WoW in early wotlk, not even playing classic.
---
&gt; Then he asked for a res and invite and I told him “No, you made your decision.”
---
You went too easy. You should have strung him along for a bit. Pretend you don't know how to res.
---
And a trap to boot!
---
Just pick a race whose model you like, you'll be looking at it more than anyone.
---
No you can also do 6 each lvl from lvl 10, then it's "only" 102
---
The people coming from Faerlina are also the ones that didn't want the Faerlina culture.

Heyo, I was in this group.
---
Come to Biggles seems decent. only had a few bad encounters. 
---
but without a good census cant really say population. but i would say i have seen roughly the same amount of each faction.
---
Im Horde.
---
farmed here for 8 hours for the awesome tip. no bags 2 drops....
---
Follow me on Twitter and twitch! I recently moved so haven't been streaming but it should be up and running soon!
---
@laayohrl and .tv/laayoh
---
Yeah, that's part of the thing for me, too. I've always been alliance, even since retail. I've never played horde before, honestly. I think the furthest I've gotten was level 25 on retail with a blood elf rogue. 
---
I really love Stormwind and Ironforge compared to the cities of the horde, but I do feel like I have half a game I've left unexplored for all this time.
---
Dance on mailboxes.
---
It’s not so much the classes are in short supply, it’s the “play what I want” mentality. Which itself isn’t bad, it’s when people are adamant about the whole “I will never ever tank” stance that it can become an issue.
---
Classes with heals are often expected to heal dungeons majority of the time, some being outright refused often if they don’t (priest/paladin). This sucks, especially with people preaching the whole “play what you want”.
---
However classes that can tank are often wanted to do so, but can refuse with out being immediately declined. They aren’t as much of a liability, especially with the current melee/spell cleave meta in dungeons. So they can get their way, without being a crutch. They are just making it slower to finding tanks to complete a group.
---
tbh I can often get more xp just killing them myself.
---
Cant all Alliance races get exalted with the Gnomes then get the mounts?
---
What's the heal rotation at level 60?  Do you spam flash heals?  Heal?  Great heal?  So many more options than playing a paladin...
---
ok ok, only reason to spec moonkin as alliance. Assume chicken form, walk onto npc...then shadowmeld. Horde just walk up and whack u ez
---
Take it one step further and mouse wheel up/down for cat bear and shift up/down for travel and X.
---
Yep! And when you finally get an epic it actually feels....epic.
---
This is the answer, all other answers are wrong
---
We'll get them back for ya
---
if he dotted the mob already for 3 sec or so then...
---
imo yes
---
Did you have your mount at 40?
---
You get way more XP soloing
---
fake, no spam for SPELLCLEAVE FARM in trade chat LUL
---
the initial tag causes extra threat. so if you tag with coc and then let blue attack, he has a harder time getting aggro
---
Hunters can pull it off.
---
One attacks you
---
2 attack your pet
---
Your pet and you attack one
---
So much gold already lol damn
---
The AH is across layers, i.e. all layers uses the same AH, so it doesn’t matter which layer you are on.
---
Thanks for ruining the farm for the rest of us...
---
You still have a copper leftover, you're rich!
---
Essentially when you and/or the mob are moving, i.e. you are trying to kite, the range for melee extends. So it becomes incredibly difficult, almost impossible, so get out of there melee range to use the hamstring kite method
---
Well, Herod players can actually transfer their characters to a new, low population server for free. This would allow me to reroll a new horde toon on Herod.
---
I just don't know if it'd be a good idea to try out another server, because Herod is east coast and (largely seems like) a majority horde server, which are too nice reasons to stick with it if I chose to go horde.
---
Paladin, but it’s the only one I’ve done.
---
Wondering this too..
---
&gt; Open world pvp can be rough, but you'll likely be able to queue for battlegrounds in seconds while horde players have to wait.
---
FWIW, Patch 1.12 introduced Battlegroups, effectively cross-server battlegrounds. While Blizz hasn't shared a lot of information on how exactly it will work yet, we can assume that Classic BGs will not be server-only, as the imbalance (and queue times) on many servers would be extreme as a result.
---
The next highest in my guild is 47 and I'm 54. There are 3 people above 50 including me so I have been pugging dungeons since launch.
---
Prot pally btw so no taunt and I die every time someone takes aggro from me even after using 2x rank 4 conc and they keep doing mind blasts
---
Well this guy is just wrong, lol. Very accurate data for patch 1.4 but we are living in patch 1.12.
---
Druids have absolutely the best threat generation in the game, even when Fury tanks are progressing into Naxx. The mitigation through armor cap and dodge is slightly under warrior but absolutely fine for most 40 man progression content.
---
What they lack is a fear break (not an issue for alliance) and one fight they get put in cat form. They also have no shield wall or other CD for when the healer is silenced.
---
Again, druids are en par with warriors in most fights, excel over warrior in 5 mans through phase 4 and into 5, struggle with 5 raid bosses and are better than warrior in a few.

OH God why, why would you remind me!! lol, and the corpse drags through dungeons..

I wouldn’t mind having the stable. And achievements.
---
No the person who can use it has EITHER the gold value OR the utility, because once equipped, it can't be resold. If the utility value truly outweighs the gold value (for example of they intend to stop leveling and only compete in a battleground bracket forever with that character) then they'll pay the gold. If the gold value outweighs the utility value (because they intend to outlevel it quickly) they would typically sell it.
---
If the player doesn't care about gold that much and just wants the pleasure of equipping an overpowered item for a while, that's fine and its their prerogative to equip rather than sell off they win. But saying that everyone wise should ignore the gold because you have some utility value is really you being the greedy one.
---
Yeah, for single mobs in know locations there are definitely some options, when it's a "kill x of y" type quest though where they're spawning all over it can be frustrating.
---
Lmao i love this one
---
lol that is hilarious.
---
Retails problem is that every new expansion makes the old one obsolete. Instead of making something new why don't they offer up a remastered version of MC with new mechanics? End of the day whoever is working on retail WoW has no fucking clue what to do anymore.
---
Because the quality is shit, and people are literally going through *more* effort to pull out their phone and take a picture than to press win+prtscn and paste into a reddit post.

Its 20 - fucking - 19. This isn't rocket science.

I've resorted to sending him in to get the first few hits off before I start anything but he still has trouble. I don't blame him, I'd want to kill the little gnome, too.

Cant wait to knife you in the back ❤

I need to remember to check the AH when I get home....though my server doesn't have a shitload of high lvl people yet
---
My man.
---
Yep this is me. I’ve never played any game while my wife is at home, not because I’m not allowed or would get in trouble but because we’re usually doing something together. It does help or may even be because we work opposite shifts so we have a few hours to ourselves every weekday.
---
I just want to say, I’m not arguing against the current system (roll need so no ninja) but the argument that “everyone needs gold” is stupid. Its born purely from people being scumtastic ninjas, not out of “fairness” or else rolling on every single item (even greys) in the dungeons would be a thing. 
---
From what I’ve read from GM posts (past and more recent) is:
---
**if you set loot rules before the party starts, then breaking those rules is considered scamming and is will be dealt with by GMs. If you say nothing, then they will tell you to use master loot next time or set loot rules prior to starting the dungeon**
---
Got it! I appreciate it.
---
Were you tanking the dungeon or dpsing?  Needing on a weapon for an off role over a main role is bad manners.
---
I wish a million gankings on your character in zones with the longest corpse runs back.
---
I'm referring to animations and visuals that you can't see on the character screen. Even if you like a race's model, sometimes their gear scales poorly or some of their animations might be bad and this is applies to a character's gender too.
---
As I said, running/basic combat animations are important but is there anything else worth considering?
---
Ah I see you two picked up the weird looking curly tipped stick from Wailing Caverns that tragically is very slightly better DPS than the much better looking crescent staff, fellow warrior.
---
You should look here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/co44by/ive_edited_the_high_resolution_original/
---
How do you even recover from something like that?
---
other races are too big for it
---
You get zero XP standing around waiting for spawns.
---
&gt;chocolate globbernaughts
---
I have to know what these are.
---
It looks extremely out of place designwise. In every game the UI has to hold on a certain style to match the tone of the rest of the game. This is a fantasy world, not "excel simulator" like EVE
---
Lol'd
---
yes it actually does, we figured it out. You have to do the save quest in order to see her loot. Stupid bug
---
2 mobs as warrior ..or same level mob with net or pet
---
Oh so I should keep shield and flash heal for emergencies. I think I also focus too much on doing more dps than I need to, should I just not use damaging abilities and only use my wand for dps?(I have 5 talent points in it)
---
I haven’t experienced this yet.  Level 25 Sulfuras

Yeah I thought about that but \*cries in no friends*

This is the exact reason I quit Classic. Just not the game I remember.
---
They ain’t that bad. I’m currently using a cesspool guild to make dungeon groups easier. It’s been pretty great and most of the people from the guild are really friendly. We all agreed though that once we hit 60 we’d leave to actually find a guild with plans and a future lol.
---
PvP is the only way to go... unless you're a scrub
---
this gives me ideas
---
Grats!
---
Bullshit, I played EQ 1997-2001, all the raids. If you were going to equip, you rolled need. If it was going on a twink or whatever, it was greed equivalent.

Tree form. On fire
---
That’s why the paladin is represented by super skinny guy.
---
How many times? I have to know.
---
Nope, healing only in pve, pvp on the Other hand u can play as all 3 speccs
---
Its essentially a timing issue. Your pet remains in combat and thus keeps you in combat. The macros DO work, but you need to time it correctly or your just dipping back into combat.
---
My friend was ranting about this the other night as well. 
---
Meanwhile 800 innocent farmers, miners and councilmen die for every 1 person's questline. Killing them is fine I guess. I'm sure the tailor twins deserved it for their twincestues deeds they committed in my fantasies after I pulled them and realized they were twins.
---
AFAIK you quest till SM and then spellcleave till 40.  No idea what then tho.
---
well if ur on firemaw i can be your friend !
---
Lol...gorilla warfare. I wonder how many gorillas he killed.
---
Am hunter, also have a lot of trouble with it. 
---
My theory is, if there was a way to macro an ability or action without a GCD, that can possibly fill the spell batch so you can just spam it and have it work 100%
---
I think it's more of being used to retail where if your health drops, you could be killed instantly. Almost every mob does something in retail. Where as classic your more worried about being hit to death with a stick the enemy just randomly found. (Also a lot of idiots not using their kits, had a warrior friend die because he just straight up panicked last night instead of using his health pots/warlock stones I made him)
---
I've actually heard worse stories.
---
Then good on him! People need to take their ilvl/minmax mindset back to retail. I'm playing classic to have F U N.
---
I know. I'm asking if there are any visual aspects of a character (i.e. items) or specific animations that are worth checking out so you don't end up hating your choice when you hit 60.
---
There's an add-on that can tell you the breakdown of your faction online at any given people.
---
People will do this on both factions in primetime for a rough idea.

I saw herod's mentioned in a comment earlier today, didn't do it myself.

I decided to help Paly tank for a group I said seen spamming for a tank and good to go for over 30 min, I join it and it's a Ret paladin, and a feral druid.
---
They both pull aggro before I get threat with consecrate and successfully tank the mobs they pull
---
I just said, see you dont need me, and left the group.
---
Ill vanish long before that :)
---
I would suggest some lines separating the zones, its kind of hard to see that large yellow line towards the top and trace it back to what zone it is on the left.

I guess if you want to take months to get to 60 you can just not use a quest addon
---
Oh boomer, you gon learn today KEK
---
They are healers in raids. Enhance and ele do terrible dps in raids and don't have any unique buffs.
---
Enhance isn't consistently good in pvp in end game and relies on luck more than any other class.
---
Ele is powerful in pvp and up there among the better specs.
---
My warlock : Pull more !
---
It’s about sending a message
---
So you're saying.. you're greedy.
---
That's what the greed button is for.
---
It depends on the layer. Sometimes STV has an entire warband of ally, sometimes its empty. 
---
This will be fixed once they remove layering as the months roll by

Lowbie Shaman checking in. Pop the stoneclaw, refresh lightning shield, add the fire nova totem. Heal. Heal again. Smack the crap outta that first mob. He ded. Oom. Run away vigorously clicking earthbind totem. Pray.

It’s guerrilla.

Corpsemaker is probably getting a bit rusty at 36. Do SM Arm imo and get Ravager and you'll be destroying. You can do 1h+shield if you want but personally I find it boring and no better than 2h so I don't really know much about it.
---
Joana's guide is great but it's from a hunter perspective, and it assumes that you grind constantly when running between steps. Thus, it's very easy to fall behind, especially on a slower leveling class. You probably need some grind, so once again SM arm sounds like a good place to go. You can also do cath for Mograine's Might, but Ravager is better imo.
---
Fighting lower mobs is just so important, it can make all the difference.
---
See, the problem
---
:(
---
Nope, the most common macros include /petpassive and /petfollow. Also the issues still happen when your pet is dismissed or dead.
---
Warlock, assemble !
---
1. You have no way to know blizzards intention, especially if they do not enforce it in any way. They have given us tools, and our system uses the exact same tools as yours.
---
2. You just made a comparison. X to Y. Call it a calculation or comparison, it is the same in this context. What X to what Y. What are the criteria. If an item will gain me 1 armor and I would lose 1 stamina, is it an upgrade. What about 2 armor. You have some system of comparison which you can not define. A system of subjective judgement calls.
---
3. There is no calculation here. The item is always worth exactly what it would sell for on the AH, which is equal to the value of equipping. The value of equipping it may change over time along with the value of gold, but they are always equip. That is how markets work. I am making no subjective valuations. I have a very specific criteria used to value the item. And that value is the same for everyone. No comparisons, no calculations.
---
4. Is it better how. Once again you have just established you are making a comparison. A subjective judgement call. By what criteria is it better. Who is deciding that. How are they deciding that.
---
5. Everyone has equal chance to get the value of the item. Whether it be AH value or Equipping it. It is the same value.
---
6. "Also, the item has a definitive stat value that players compare to their own gear and decide which is better, your camp is the one arbitrarily adding value to it by putting on a random gold price."
---
Is that your explanation. Because I am not giving it some random gold price. It is valued at market price. always is. always will be.
---
If you are going to disagree that goods are not worth their market value, you are arguing against the foundations of economics. Good luck.
---
I don't care if it is worth 0 gold, or 1 million. It is worth the same amount of gold to everyone. I don't care about the gold value vs equip value, because they are the same.
---
And you havent even attempted to explain away that your system is susceptible to ninjas.
---
Selling value is absolutely close enough to standard.
---
The point is that the GOLD is equally valuable to everyone. If warden staff is such a huge upgrade then the person should have farmed gold solo, rather than being a drain on the 5 man group.
---
Bankenstein.
---
I re-rolled last night after reaching 40. It feels great to get out of the hard grind.
---
Gtfo this forum, TBC was the best iteration of wow.
---
I mean,  that's pretty cool, and the idea suits my playstyle.  Like in games like league I've always preferred support mages, combine damage and utility.  And thinking of it that way makes me more inclined to play one.
---
But I'm not sure if you are aware of all the hunter bugs currently in classic.  Which is party fueling my indecision.
---
I removed questie from my addon folder and reinstalled via Twitch - looks like its resolved now!
---
sounds fun
---
I know
---
Yea I’ve never understood that. I leveled from 30-60 entirely as a protection warrior back in vanilla.
---
Hard disagree- mained mage for years and leveled like three for fun between vanilla and wotlk. Intel/Stam is always 100% better. 
---
The spirit regen isn’t worth the mana pool and spellpower you miss out on, esp when you can make yourself free water
---
theres literally no point in taking a shadow priest into raids. ofc u can do it but as u already said u know the problems of sp. using lower ranks isnt making things better. u want to keep up shadow weaving and wand inbetween to be somewhat useful for the warlocks in the raid
---
not a bug. works as intended. Next
---
"I think I need to go visit the ah anyways" - what I tell myself as I take rez sickness and rage hearth.
---
It's not really ezmode as much as it it's just trying to play the game reasonably. For instance, 9here I am right now trying to do quests at Mystral Lake, Ashenvale](https://i.imgur.com/xg9xMF4.png). Four horde in this one little area, and it's just me. No other alliance toons. I seriously cannot enjoy playing when things are like this.
---
You could be right. :)
---
if you drive by kill 5-10 under you, you are exactly the scumbag that deserves to be camped until you stop playing
---
Well, to be perfect it needs some children around  
---
*This was a dark humor comment, do not panic.*
---
carbonite was the tits, came out during TBC though
---
WoW has no tutorial about threat mechanics, most people just do their rotation (if they know it) and ignore everything else. As a warlock, I've accepted im the second tank and I have plenty of utilities to keep myself healed without the healers help. Also just plain wand damage pulls which is annoying.
---
Totems are ALWAYS viable. More or not for the DPS but Totems and off heals. you are a hybrid class so when it comes to PVP you will be doing it ALL.   
---
i've seen ENH shammy in raids.. just like pally are Buff bots.   
---
Also gotta remember. The skill Cap is so much more better than it was in 04 so you can IMO bring basically ANYONE and still down bosses ive seen people take lev 55 shamans in MC AKA SHROUD and get through it.
---
*Shocking news*
---
Love being shaman on opening days.
---
Thanks man. Interesting that this will determine your quest path if you want it, otherwise your handing in thousands of runecloth.
---
Ahh I’m understanding now when to use my abilities. Other than fortitude and shadow proc do I have any other buff I should use before a pull, like maybe renew the tank at the start of the fight
---
Mine’s been the ~ tilde ~ key since like 13 years ago. Luv it
---
What do you think
---
I picked up a cheap laptop at frys like a year backed. Don’t got any specs handy but I remember basically buying it as a pdf reader, couldn’t have cost more than 150. 
---
Motherfucker runs WoW better than it runs an Internet browser
---
Have a hunter at 30 and so far have only noticed the incredible dead zone that makes fighting rogues nearly impossible. What others? Haven’t had any pet related issues at all and I heard FD is kinda bugged but I remember it not being 100% in Vanilla.
---
Exactly :)
---
As a mage I see no problem here.
---
Wotlk started the Easy Dungeons trend which I don’t like
---
Racism is dead
---
Worth it.
---
Then why did someone else need it?
---
Little disappointed it wasn’t modified to fit wow. UnGoro warfare would be 👌
---
Either use it to make space, or hope you just are click happy and buy the wrong one
---
Source please.
---
Add me,  pillo lol 35 rogue.
---
Can I have your gold? I'm 5 away from my mount
---
That's completely expected.
---
Game assets might be large, but once downloaded they only need to be updated on patches.
---
Actual gameplay isn't transmitting video or images, it's just transmitting numbers and text.
---
Renew isn't great either unless it's talented. Stick to heal and lower rank heals for small bursts.
---
Yeah it’s nice when someone says thanks, but you need to remember that if someone didn’t *ask* for your help then don’t expect them to gush over it.
---
I love getting random buffs and stuff from people, I’ll toss out a /thank or /cheer or wherever but honestly I don’t *need* the buff. If I missed you cause I was alt tabbed or chatting to friends please don’t get pissy, just be happy you did a nice thing.
---
These are all greed rolls. I didn’t need anything
---
who cares about chineese ? those drones shouldn't be treated like real humans
---
Still a better story than BFA
---
Leveld in Classic as a hunter.. And its happens i've FD and it never dropped agro sometimes just how it worked in vanilla, If pets in Combat you most likely will be too
---
It's not as OP as youd think. Had a multi boxer in retail griefing the main city hub with 15 unholy DKs and 5 resto shamans, we formed a raid after about 10 mins and killed him 3 or 4 times before he took res sickness and left.  Also saw some posts on retail wow subreddit where alliance would complain that getting teamed with him for BGs like alterac valley would be an auto lose because half their entire raid could only be at one single place on the map at a time
---
Literally just walk behind people skinning all their kills
---
Lol
---
It should be seen by hovering over the attack button located in the general tab of your spellbook. But I can't check this to confirm right now so I may be wrong.
---
 Bruh.  Come to Grobbulus,RP PVP server. Lots of alliance. Lots of fun action.
---
Just in case you are confused, we are referring to Ravager.
---
I'm guessing it has nothing to do with you being a male playing a half naked women wearing "plate armor" and is entirely because the 2d armor painted onto the character model looks "cool".. right?
---
I just use a macro with /cancelaura Bladestorm
---
Yeah old ironforge
---
It’s a paradise for paladins
---
I guess you can play it that way but tbh it just seems less efficient- regardless of our difference in preference on mage itemization, this dude was need rolling on *every* piece of cloth gear, lots of which was high spirit or stam/spirit whale gear and I lost huge upgrades that were just marginal for him/her.
---
Was pretty lame and selfish.
---
2v2s??? U dumb?
---
Yeah because large guilds with cesspool members never existed in Classic?  They did.
---
I cant tell if your joking or not but you can ask any guard in a major city they will tell you all the locations of profession trainers
---
I really like this one
---
A lot of people in classic that won’t group on a quest because the drop rate is low AND each drop is for one person only. 
---
I can understand them, though...
---
mmmm im gonna bust your bubble but we are not getting arena's in classic, atleast not until they release burning crusade
---
Just wait till you realize you have to train multiple pets to get diffrent pet spells and you can only train them if the mob lvl has color if not your pet wont lvl.
---
Well you are in the minority there, but you still have a chance to win the roll and equip it, and you also have an equal chance of winning a big money drop you can't use which you can cash in to buy one you can. 
---
And the real truth is there are plenty of nice people out there that will probably just let you have the sweet boe if you say you're going to equip it, or at least sell it to you super cheap, especially this early in the game whenthe economy isn't mature yet and that item is going to be taking up a bank slot until phase 3 when the twink scene gets in full gear. 
---
We're just talking about the default behaviors *in pickup groups* here, which, because of the perverse incentives built into the system kind of necessitate need rolling everything. Decency, courtesy, and good will are still things, especially when you're playing with people you know (i.e. guildies, friends, purple you group with regularly fit whatever reason). This really is nothing new, and need before greed rolling on big ticket items didn't die with vanilla, it died very early on in vanilla. I started playing during patch 1.6, and even back then it was well established that if you rolled greed on rare boes in a pug you were probably gong to get ninjaed, and it was better not to be a sucker.
---
that worked, thank you
---
Yea
---
Um. That's Hillbrad Foothills, you can't not be flagged.
---
Health pot, sheep pet, spam frost bolt  hunter just stares at death because all the ones that tried to gank me last night are unaware of melee.
---
I've found that attractiveness to women is a threshold thing. You just have to look not-hideous-enough.
---
If your personalities are compatible she will weirdly start shaping her definition of "cute" to things about you over time, if that makes any sense.
---
In theory, you wanna save mana for your main job (healing). The party will get REAL mad if they all die, cause you went oom casting smite, lol. Once you have a handle on how much healing you'll be doing, you might mix in some dots and bonus dps, but that's a bit more advanced, and I'd always err on the side of  reserving mana
---
Jesus Christ, this man travelled to Central Africa and trained with Rainforest Gorillas to master their warfare.
---
Is that some kind of short creature threat that I'm too tall to understand?
---
So the one you noticed is leeway for melee.  Gives them huge ranges.   Theres a delay on auto shot they say is "working as intended," where if you dont stop moving right before your AS, it adds another .5 seconds to the cast time when you finally stop.  FD is a big one.  I've personally noticed pet issues.  And traps not working some of the time, not triggering, ect.  And I think that may cover it.
---
How does enhance feel when windfury can't proc on itself?
---
If you two level together you're better off doing daggers to backstab while he tanks
---
Horde on Kirtonos
---
Basically Earth Shock and rock biter generate a lot of threat. You use down ranked earth shock as a “sunder” to hold threat and use a max rank earth shock as a taunt. Coupled with strong utility totems shaman tanks can hold their own in dungeon tanking. After level forty you do need to be a try hard. But for a lot of people its a very satisfying experience.
---
Auctioneer is working perfect for me since I downloaded it from Twitch/Forge :)!
---
Heavy leather is really common at the level 30-40 range. There aren't many zones you can access right now if you're targeting that.
---
But at your range camp around areas that people need for cooking quests. You'll have a lot of non-skinners farming mobs and looting them and leaving behind the corpses. I maxxed out my skinning to 150 in redridge alone because of the boar and whelp corpses littered everywhere.
---
Once you get to level 30, shimmering flats is a gold mine for heavy leather since everything except the birds can be skinned and LOTS of quests to commit genocide to the entire zone.
---
Hope that helps a bit.
---
So you don’t know that’s it’s easy.
---
If someone is going to equip something and actually use it, then i'll happily pass

Just did a Shadowfang run. Tank had skinning...  
---
The run before, Stockades with a "Paladin tank" without any aggro abilities activated.  
---
Yesterday, DM. Tank hat 6(!!) Stamina on all his equip combined and started flaming me when I asked him to equip his tank gear (like, really personal stuff), then left the group and wiped us on purpose.
---
karma whoring fugly slutmog ... never change classicwow , never change ...
---
Wand spec with a decent wand like cookies’ wand or the quest reward from bfd can drop mobs pretty quickly and you’ll never ever drink.
---
It goes mind blast, swap (improved), shield right as they get to you, wand, wand....dead.  Because spirit tap is proc’ing you just never really need to stop and drink, so it becomes really efficient questing.
---
On top of that you’re tough as nails.  As you progress deep into the tree you can even get some spellpower and power infusion.  It’s a ton of fun.
---
Sweet graph, but what/where are the Burning Steepes? Is this a new zone they snuck in to Classic?
---
Usually by the time a mage gets into melee with me, they are low health. There are bad players no matter the class.
---
Everyone cant do it though, it comes close to essentially being pay to win, depending on what you're wanting to win.
---
Is it confirmed that classic+ after naxx is happening?
---
I used to do this in Classic and BC. I was always the rich one in-game. Can confirm that did not so easily translate to real life abilities.
---
**Edit/Note: Starting the run in master-loot without stating any loot rules is not considered ninja looting either. This is why its on YOU to check the loot policy. Right click the party window and check to see what the loot policy is set to (if its master loot, ask the party lead to clarify the loot rules)**
---
You typically want to use mouseover macros for your heals so you can target mobs (for wanding especially) and still be able to throw heals on people. Id be careful with your dotting that you arent screwing up your mana regen.
---
I care and I love it.
---
Will do when i get home from work
---
Are you playing a Hunter right now? I also had a Hunter in Vanilla and FD/trap is not working like it use to.
---
I don't think you know how layers work.
---
I'm in Westfall on my lock right now and these goddamn harvester robot things are immune to fear AND my Voidwalker's taunt. I'm reasonably certain that this is what hell is like

If someone ever rampages on me for this I'll copy&amp;paste them the whole wowhead primer on the 5 second rule.

MC'ing?  Don't know all the lingo quite yet lol.
---
Nah you go get the flight path
---
If an Unique item drops, do you still see people roll for it?
---
 &gt; This is the exact reason I quit Classic. Just not the game I remember.
---
No its not. These guilds have always existed. You can disable guild invites. You can join a decent guild. You can start a guild. You can even make a guild, kick everyone out and be a one man guild if you want the tag but not the drama.
---
People spamming /ginvite is not the reason you quit Classic.
---
Why is a paladin dying at all...
---
Lesson learned: never get cocky when you can't instatag the quest mob using macros
---
Ok fair, but it's being generated far out of proportion to the typical value generated by such activity.
---
As a Tank, that is just funny, you can see the panic in the twichy movements when the mob moves to them. 
---
Hunters pulling before I do russle my jimmies though. I got a smooth pull lined up and then... trigger happy ruins it, mobs go left right, middle, up, down. Pulls more mobs, no chance to fetch aggro. It's like balancing spinning dinner plates drunk.
---
"Oh sorry I didn't pay attention, also is that a weapon I could possibly maybe somewhere ever use? NEED."
---
No, just hoping.
---
&gt;&gt;ruman was the worse president that the United States has ever had.  When Chinese hegemony finally topples the US, it will have been the inevitable result of Truman not letting MacArthur do what had to be done.
---
&gt;
---
It's not Chinese hegemony that will topple the US. Our politicians are doing a great job right now with pushing being proud of ignorance, decrying education and academia, engaging in regressive beliefs, pushing economic theories that don't work (trickle down theory and Keynesian economics).
---
&gt;Yep, Every day into the 21st century is another day that proves Truman was naive in thinking Chinese communism and American Ideals could co-exist.  
---
Except that's not what Truman, or other economists thought. They believed that by opening up in trade with China, that China would be lifted out of third world country status and become richer. There would then exist a free flow of goods, and alongside that, education. That as China grew more prosperous from capitalist ideas, that it would also grow more demographic. That's been the trade in many countries in the West.
---
Obviously, didn't work as quickly as they hoped. But, no one could have factored in how technology affected this.
---
&gt;Korea is the worlds best example of why MacArthur was actually right.
---
How so?
---
But you have to spend to train it and use up a slot in your bar... seems meh for a nominal gain.
---
I just attack and murder them.
---
It's a shame that t2 is such a good set, yet it is complete trash
---
Well you started playing WoW after it went to *total* shit so that's not surprising. Presumably, if you thought that was fun, you would have missed other great games as well. There are lively emu servers for most old MMOs whenever you get bored of WoW. I know right now you're thinking you'll play it until you die of old age, but remember that you made this post specifically because you realized your interpretation of fun was wrong to begin with. Nothing is fun forever! Enjoy it and move on before you ruin it.
---
Came here to say that

Earlier after that happened with me I stayed after finishing my quota and killed a few more.

Dude, Classic is making me hate Hunters again.
---
Hunter invites me (healer) to do elite quest. Over halfway through Hunter leaves because they soloed a few before I got there and their quest is done. I'm stuck with an elite quest that is 90% done unable to finish.

gratz on 56. but tell me what class is harder to lvl ?

You can expect a lot of bitching from your melee dps when you are missing a windfury totem for .7 seconds.
---
Abuse? 
---
Its an in game mechanic that Blizzard have implemented for all of us to use. 
---
There are no restrictions / guidelines / general use terms that have been advised to us regarding it's usage.
---
There was also a blue post very recently stating that it's not an issue and not many people are doing what he's doing right now so it's not hurting the economy at all.  It's fine guys.
---
Chill.
---
P.S you can bet a lot of the hardcore players / guilds are doing this exact same thing.
---
Worst is people quitting dungeons half way through after a single wipe. That's one of the most irritating things I remember from when I used to play retail and it seems to have seeped into classic a little bit.
---
I'm jealous, is it glorious? I'm also level 32 and I've been working towards it, need to farm elementals now

And remove BFA and everything from cata onwards 😍
---
Well like I said, from reading the Bnet forums and searching for posts about ninja looting (that had blue posts) it seems if **loot rules are laid out before a run** its considered **scamming** and not **ninja looting**
---
Its why I stated in the first sentence “Ninja looting is not against the ToS”
---
GMs won’t help with ninja looting (unless the party lead swaps to master loot mid combat)
---
With this post, laying out loot rules turns any “ninja looting” into “scamming” which IS against the ToS.
---
I fucking love how Blizzard didn't take the easy way out and normalize hit boxes.

You just hit the first viable point for AOE grinding, and imo it’s super effective in Classic. Check out the [Icy Veins’ Guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-leveling-guide#AoEGrinding)  for details, it’s a stupidly good resource with specific advice by spec and level from 1-60.

Lmao Ive been playing wow for 15 years bro. Chill out ya old fuck. If anything thats sadder thinking about some 40 year old virgin sitting in his moms basement trying to act tough to what he thinks is a kid. 
---
Yea I played fortnite for a bit and now Im back to playing classic and I bet that really triggers you. Probably why you keep responding. All you have in your sad miserable life is classic wow. 
---
Keep acting hard towards what you assume are kids, that makes you a real badass and bot some sad sack of shit who probably should just kill himself because hes so sad and alone.
---
Look man, your obviously trying to explain away your terrible reasoning to be a ninja, and I don't have time for this anymore. The moment you attach a gold value to your decision you hit greed, it's that simple.

Have fun being a ninja and being cancer on whatever server you're on.

Ahhh thank you so much. I’ll add these in as soon as I get home and get back to my toenail-clipping level of difficulty healing

It's kind of bugged at the moment, hopefully Blizzard fixes it soon. Feign Death isn't dropping combat the way it should.

I just do what is done to me bud. For every skull level rogue that jumps me when I'm farming mobs alone a dozen alliance lowbies will get the same fate when I see them. It's only fair.
---
Didn't train in res sorry...
---
No Reagants, sorry...
---
It sure is nice to make those excuses again lol.
---
Jeff, uh, finds a way...
---
Fucking yes my dude! I waited forever for that quest god damn does it take forever
---
It's definitely possible to get decent gear and do casual raiding still, but unless you can play 10 hours+ per day you won't be able to grind the cutting edge gear for 2 characters I'd imagine - not to mention it would be tedious. But you can definitely still gear two characters if you just do some raiding and such.

Any time before 4pm there has been no queue on Skeram the past few days. 20 minute queue when I checked before I left from work today at 6.
---
*laughes in warlock*
---
Acid does either this or makes you Nick Cage in Mandy
---
You just arbitrarily defined the rules for need and greed. 
---
The fact of the matter is that everyone equally needs gold, end of story. And frankly it’s another fact that the people who disagree with this are almost always the less skilled more casual players.
---
I did :'(
---
Plain and simple - it will be harder to find raids.
---
I played a druid back in vanilla. And at that time druids healed. And that was it. You may be able to off tank. But it will be harder to find a group. 
---
BUT - seriously pay how you want. If you like playing a druid do it. Honestly my main is a druid and honestly always has been. I love the utility. 
---
And there have been several all druid raid videos

Taking engineering is like getting a whole new set of skills, that's what make it 'fun'. You can mind control, nuke, revive, get an extra charge, reflect spells etc. Other professions you can just buy it off the AH like potions or gear. But for engineering you have to stick with it if you actually want to use it.
---
Just have a look at the list of items you can craft and use
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/engineering#crafted-items:0-2
---
So like, why would I level first aid? I have a paladin and a mage, I won't ever need a bandage right?
---
Nah that a hunter killing anything before lvl 10
---
i think hanlon's razor applies here:
---
The seller meant to put it up for 81s and accidentally did 81g
---
Uncommons feel uncommon. Rares seem rare. Epics seem epic. Legendaries are legendary and most of us will never get them.
---
So we are only talking about unbound items, not including BoP and quest items. Over time, the value of items generated from killing enemies is worth exactly a combination of your time and resources spent, minus the XP gained. At lvl 60 the XP is ignored, so items are worth exactly your time and resources. That is how the market price is set.
---
Yeah can't do that only to new server if they let transfer anywhere could make ques even worse on servers not better.

---
more threat than a max level heroic strike
---
Also, do you have dispel macros set up? I would always use those on my priest in retail. Basically, separating Dispel Magic into two "spells": one for friendlies (a debuff dispel) and one for enemies (a buff purge).
---
**Friendly Debuff Dispel:**
---
    /cast [@target,help,nodead][@player] Dispel Magic
---
This will cast dispel on your target if they are a friendly and not dead. Otherwise, it will cast on yourself. This means you can have an enemy targeted, but still dispel yourself.
---
(Of course, an alternative would be to just use your self-cast key -- usually alt, but I never really got used to that when I was healing.)
---
**Enemy Buff Purge**
---
    /cast [@target,harm,nodead] Dispel Magic
---
This will cast Dispel Magic on your target is they are an enemy and not dead.
---
**Mouseover Macros**
---
Finally, are you using mouseover macros? Very beneficial when healing, so you don't have to keep targeting people you want to heal. Instead, you just hover your cursor over them in the raid frames, and it will cast on them.
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help,nodead][] Heal
---
This will cast on the person your cursor is hovering over if they are a friendly and not dead. Otherwise, it will behave normally (i.e., casting on your target if they are friendly; otherwise, casting on yourself).
---
In retail WoW, I made a macro like this for every single healing spell I had. It took a while to set up, but then I was free to just mouse over people in the raid frames and mash buttons -- without having to keep switching targets.
---
300% more parry, 250% less crit.
---
90% of the time this can be solved by context. A lvl 60 asking for dm vs a level 18 asking for dm = no problem. If you are 60 and ask about deadmines (???) Then its on you to clarify it.
---
except no one is a ninja or can be a ninja if we all need
---
Have a great day
---
It’s BM (bad manners) to solo quest bosses if others are around wanting to group for it. So you may not like it but you’re still kinda an ass if you don’t want others to just tag the quest boss.
---
Well, I find the social aspect of dungeon running to be the hardest part, so if everyone just agreed up front to all roll on everything that would make me a lot less stressed about deciding whether or not to roll on stuff. Currently I pass a lot of stuff that I think I should be able to roll on because I don't know if everyone else would agree and I'm not up to having a discussion about it.

---
That's literally the appeal for a lot of people, including me. It's super relaxing and chill to level in vanilla, not to mention immersive. That's why people like it.
---
For me slow = good and fast = bad, at least when it comes to mmo's. I'm not playing call of duty here, i'm not looking for constant action.
---
Aw man I’m sorry to hear that. We wiped 1x, and almost did a second time as well but got lucky. We were 1 boss from finishing and then a couple guys had to leave so I didn’t technically finish a full run. But these were just random pickups and we really did well together.
---
One guy (a lvl 22 priest) complained two guys were too low DPS at 15-16 and he quit on us, but we basically did the whole dungeon start to finish with only one wipe! So screw him! Haha.
---
Better luck next time mate!
---
I would switch, only because pvp servers are more fun.
---
Why are you on this subreddit
---
A quel memer?
---
I’m a noob lol. I thought you could only have two at a time?
---
I defined them as they have been defined by Blizzard in later iterations of the game.
---
You just arbitrarily generalized when describing people who disagree with you.
---
Adorable :)
---
That depends entirely on your definition of "a ton of time".  It will probably be pretty hard to maintain two characters on separate realms to the point that you will clear naxx with both of them unless you have someone sponsoring your consumes and enchants and you can basically just raid log on at least one of the characters.
---
This is why I've got two screens this time around.

I played on a pserver and hated the dumb robot chicken so much that I farmed the 600g or whatever it took to get enough runecloth to get IF rep and buy a ram

Even during vanilla I didn't read a single quest. All thotbot, alla, and addons. What an incredible waste of time.

Nani the fuck did you just fucking iimasu about watashi, you chiisai bitch desuka? Watashi’ll have anata know that watashi graduated top of my class in Nihongo 3, and watashi’ve been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores. Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the top letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nothing to watashi but just another weaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has never been mimasu’d before on this continent, mark watashino fucking words. Anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker. As we hanashimasu, watashi am contacting watashino secret netto of otakus across the USA, and anatano IP is being traced right now so you better junbishimasu for the ame, ujimushi.

It took years for me as a warrior to put charge as my number 1.
---
2 major reasons. 
---
1) Retail, the sheer number of blues purples and oranges we get made them feel grey and green.
---
2) what someone wears in classic is always actually what they are wearing. No half naked titans swinging trunks of trees killing gods. We are what we wear. Its kinda refreshing.
---
Barrens chat on my server is like T_D
---
Idk man.. rogues can blast throu mobs. then again i played rogue  in vanilla tbc
---
Once you get honored you can go up to 30c a piece. What I do is spend all my money bidding on really cheap linen cloth and bags under 2s and log out to go to work. I get about 1/5 of the items I bid on when I get home in the morning and buy out all the cheap mats.
---
Wow am I the only one interested in seeing these people's Personal Best Times after reaching 60 here?
---
Please make it happen!
---
If you want to do world pvp or bgs it's better to get the minority faction. There will be more to kill and instant queues. Alliance is definitely the pvp faction this time.
---
Free transfers? Did I miss something?
---
how about devouring plague?? 3 min cd and 1/5th of my mana
---
Do you tank? Back is useful for tanking.
---
7pm EST on Faerlina and I'm waiting in a 3.5 hour queue. Got d/c'd, feelsgoodman
---
It really depends how far you want to take it.   If you feel you have the time to play both then why not?  Assuming you get both to 60 then you could realistically play both.   But why two accounts?  Couldnt you just roll a character on the same account?
---
As for playing both.   Only you can really answer that.  It depends on you.
---
Laughs in Stoneform.
---
No worries!  Thanks for sharing the laughs with us.
---
Raid healing was a lot of rank 3-4 heal spam once you had gear.  Dungeon healing on your own was more variety, renew on the tank and occasionally to top up dps, mid-rank heal/lower rank greater heal for manageable tank damage, with flash heal and PW:S as oh shit buttons.
---
I mean, just googling "zoomer meme" brings up https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zoomer which does a decent job of explaining it.  
---
It's used outside of WoW as well. Quite often in connection to Twitch or games popular on Twitch.
---
I don't see why it wouldn't be in classic. Is there some evidence for it not being there?
---

Yeah that was my guess but I wanted to make sure. I don't mind being a healer, but I mind respeccing every time. I'll keep going and heal for higher lvl and probably lvl a warrior as my DPS.

---
ok what you thinking brotha
---
Working as intended by Blizzard.
---
I’m just glad I got to kill some mobs in Vanilla Nax. Not bosses. Just mobs.
---
Okay, thank you because I haven't bought a new account in years for RAF and back then you paid like 20$ for the base game and then the xpacs after.  
---
Also when you clicked play now it took you to the subscription splash page which confused me.
---
Layering will be addressed and its the number 1 complaint blizzard are getting right now.
---
They implemented layering so you could play and do quests and kill mobs without 25,000 players trying to do the same thing.
---
And respawns. Why does Stockades need to respawn mobs 10 minutes after they were killed? If you wipe near the end, enjoy doubling your time in instance
---
Classicwow.live is a great step-by-step walk through, but if you want to choose your own zones and see quest highlights, Wowhead has a Horde guide which compares each zone in a level range and lists notable rewards: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/horde-leveling-classic-wow
---
I guess they made that change in BC or WotLK, then. Int/stam is still a million times better than spirit/stam for mages.
---
Queef ;o
---
I have my own story of this, but from the other persepctive.
---
I was cruising around Darnassus, handing in quests, getting new skills, levelling my tailor/ench and so on, when I see "WTB wand!" from a level 9 priest in general chat.
---
Now, I'm a priest. I know how important a wand is. I'm also an enchanter, so I can make them. I pop open my bags and see the mats to make a couple lesser wands. Easy peasy I think, and I whisper the other priest "Hey, I'll make you the level 5 wand, my mats, no charge". 
---
Obviously the newer priest is super hyped, and we meet up outside the bank, and I start crafting the wand. Then I realized I had the mats to make 3 lessers on me at the time, so I craft them all and drop them in the trade window. Little priest says something to the effect of "hey, I only wanted the one, you don't have to give those to me." I tell them that those are all free, I just had the spare mats.
---
Then as they're leaving I go "hey wait a sec, I think I have a spare greater wand lying about in buyback!" (Greaters on my server auction for less than vendor price, for some reason), so I run back, rebuy the wand and throw that in for free.
---
It cost me ~1s 50c in mats and 14s in buyback fees, but making a person's day like that is worth it!
---
Edgemaster... I am one of those.
---
Spam sinister strike and then use eviscerate
---
Slam operates on a separate cooldown from your regular attack swing so if you time it to where you’re using it halfway through your regular attack cooldown you basically do double the dps. It’s crazy good if used correctly.
---
Watching Peeve stream the other day and he's playing wow for first time ever. Avid MMO fan from aaancient history. Says someone in Ultima Online used to collect player made books and collate them in their player house and decided to live their character life as a librarian, having people visit the house and read the vast, rare collection of books he'd collected.
---
Wish there was something similar with wow
---
I can’t be the only one who thought that was a pickle
---
Rattlegore seems perfect.  High pop but almost never has a queue. Rolled my alliance alts there and plan on spending quite a bit of time there in the couple of years ahead of us.
---
You just wait until I get on Reddit, mister!
---
Some group of 4 wouldn't invite me for whatever reason when we were doing a killing quest so I followed them around pinging mob before they hit it and when timed correct, I would get the ping but they would still pull the mob which essentially was leeching kills from them. They only tried inviting me once I was 14 out of 15 complete and I declined. Felt so good that I finished before them somehow haha

When I first ever went through this quest, I tamed the enraged Stanley and even kept Stanley as his name. So that I could pretend I did not just kill an innocent dog

I never thought about that. That's very useful. Thank you.

this makes me feel real good
---
ok shitter

I agree. Mine are always bound to B3 (mousewheel click), never missed an interrupt since.
---
if only...
---
That friend shouldn't have skipped English lessons
---
I’ve seen that but I don’t think he’s available to kill yet. Do you think I could make a decent amount of gold making them?
---
I definitely had that happen back in retail bc, so makes sense that it would happen in classic
---
i dunno man, i have a target macro and /cast moonfire on my mousewheel, i've yet to lose a tagging duel.
---
Helps to make a bank Alt and mail skinning / mining / herbalism stuff / items and have them monitor the AH for a good time to sell.  Also send it silver so they can list for the deposit
---
Wow this is so wrong. Wpvp is an absolute nightmare when you’re outnumbered and you won’t get faster BG queues because there will be cross realm BGs.
---
When you are 60 what do you care more about pve or pvp? Trolls are better pve. 
---
In the long run it doesn't really matter play what you feel like.
---
Cant wait to see all the lvl 1 bank alts cursing each other out in trade chat every time these things half in price
---
It’s edgemaster’s so yes you are an idiot too :)
---
Yo dude. You're memeing so great, these other guys dont even know you're memeing.
---
+1 on all my reddit accounts
---
And the CPU?
---
No it isn’t. Rotations actually exist in retail, you have to learn how to play your class not just spam 1 ability. Mechanics in raids are difficult. People have more tools in pvp which lead to having to know other classes abilities and predict how to counter them. 
---
Classic isn’t harder it’s just slower
---
I do have the schematic btw just wondering if it’s actually worth anything
---
Honestly I am liking this priest.  Surprisingly tanky for a clothe class because you can self heal.  In a party it's super fun.
---
Whats funnier, is the amount that they think these are worth are NOTHING compared to the time it takes to grind out specific gear that is BOP And not only that but the enchants and shit. There is so much more to twinking than a couple boes....not to mention that low boes were very loaded on the AH till about mid BC on the server i played originally. I didnt have a problem just buying them to level.
---
I think everybody understands that principle quite well, but since there's no mechanical enforcement of the rules (like auto-binding items you roll need on), and no recourse of any kind when (not if) you get screwed over by someone else rolling need on a big-ticket boe that they intend to sell, the words in the interface have completely lost their meaning. Even most people who can equip rare low-level twink boe drops turn around and sell them to the twink market, and enough people have been screwed over losing out on rolls for end-game BIS boes that nobody is taking chances. Just win what drops you can, and cash them in to buy the items you need. It's fair, efficient, and simple, and people have been doing it that way since 2005.
---
I think it happened to me in Wrath, and later on in retail too?  I think it has to do with a server/client desync?  But I'm not an expert so I'm not sure.
---
I have leatrix, so that must be it.
---
or they just don't want to group with anyone.
---
Axe. Slowest swing, highest damage. Human sword skill only really matters for raids.
---
that's pretty damn hardcore man fair play to you although i can only imagine you look like the guy from the south park episode
---
I’ll tell you that warrior is one of the most boring classes to level in the game.  Definitely not for everybody.  I’d suggest rolling a new char and see if you find something you like more if you’re not enjoying it.
---
What class is piquing your interest?
---
It happens sometimes. In my experience if you get kicked by the server or you have a game crash then you carry on as normal, but if you lag out badly due to poor networking/internet this bug happens a bit more.
---
Just my experience though, it's pretty rare all around.
---
I bind auto run to my mousewheel and interrupts to the thumb button. Becomes very automatic to get a pummel or kick.
---
movement should always be a combination of keyboard and mouse and keyboard turning is bad (very slow)
---
I have it, I got the drop from WC which is better dps by 0.9.
---
I don't use renew at the start of every fight but a lot of the time it is good to do
---
Rerolling can turn into a bit of an addiction or habit... Id say stick with a Main and build a connection. Many people lose interest because they roll too much and never build a solid connection with one toon.. Imo the racials aren't that big of a deal,  I choose my races based off aesthetics. Once you level a main to 60, feel free to create as many alts as youd like.
---
Everytime you pass a dead player, res then and 15 pushups

Yea people just posting shit for 2g

Already started up on a few epics and some recipes not to mention crafting mats lol. Oh and GREENS. Worth a fortune when people need to level enchanting after they get recipes. Lol.
---
i wanna see the ravenholdt rep fully featured
---
I keep a and d bound to default turning because they strafe while steering anyways.
---
Lmao defaulting to ad hominem? Also, Int gives crit, which makes it way more valuable to mages. With priest talents, spirit will give them a spell damage and healing bonus.
---
I’m sorry that you’re wrong about stat prio for classes
---
There is no pvp realm that is alliance dominated.
---
BS won't really make kickass gear until basically pre-raid best in slot items. Kickass gear requires a bit about knowing which quests give really good rewards and a bit about getting lucky/being determined to get the right dungeon gear drops.
---
I ground SM Armory for 4 hours with a warrior. The item he wanted only dropped once and I outrolled him on it. That was a solid 6-7 kills of that boss.
---
how do you know what's the point for the guys who declined the group invitation?
---
Where did the Tauren come from?
---
Druids are better at tanking low level instances than Warriors are since they have better AoE threat. The only thing druids can't tank are raid bosses.
---
Amy Druid love? It's the one class I didn't really mess around with back in the day. Thinking of rolling one at some point.
---
if they're top sniper in the whole US armed forces then they're easily found!
---
Yeah I agree with what you said, and most games already implemented such systems. Dota 2's one is still the best lol; win a set amount of games to get out of "Low Priority" queue with other "Low Priority" players to lift your ban.
---
for leveling this is pretty much it until you get more abilities like stuns , etc

Too many chiefs, not enough Indians.

I play undead when I play horde but the starting area is depressing as fuck. So there's that, though you could always go to another area.

But anyway, end of the day your race won't *really* matter. I personally wouldn't bother to reroll but level 17 isn't that much time so if you want, now is the time.

Probably the best gloves you'll get prior to later raids. As human, not as much with your racial, but still amazing. Depends on if you have a good raid group or need the money more.

Worth it!
