That's good to know.  I have name plates on and normally I just select my tanks target (i have the "show targets target" thing selected)  and do it that way but that takes more clicks and more time.

Idk I’ve run a lot of dungeons and this hasnt really been a problem. You should just use taunt

What's odd is that it won't let me Uninstall. I can delete the folder though.

Did you not play Warcraft III?

I seen him!

When you're talking to a trainer make sure you haven't got filters on. Maybe you've turned off 'available' abilities so it's not showing up.
---
It shouldn't matter which trainer you go to afaik they'll all have the abilities.

When Oblivion meets WoW
---
Kirtonos has very small queues in peak hours. 300-800. It’s full in peak hours (5-7pm pst it’s full) then after that, when the eastern folks have to go to bed, it’s still high up until 12am to sometimes 2am until the western folks have to log off. I’m loving it, even with layers it still feels alive.
---
UnitFramesImproved could be that one
---
Yeah I haven’t had an issue with it. I’m not on the computer atm but I believe they have their own “classic” version of the mod now.
---
Would you support removing damage numbers from the game entirely? I consider a lack of mob health to be an oversight by the dev team and the way I see it, if you support the idea that mob health should just be a percentage, then your own abilities should not have known damage values. "Hit shit til it dies", right? It makes it a more skillful game, no?
---
I'm not using healbot and I'm not using anything to tell me what to do. I literally just want to have enough data to decide between eviscerate and refreshing slice and dice. I know what kind of damage those abilities do, but I do not know how much damage the enemy can take. That doesn't make any sense.
---
I can't name one RPG where you can't see mob health other than final fantasy and that's actually part of the progression, where you eventually unlock enemy health bars. WoW doesn't actually have a system for learning info about the enemy(like DnD), so I don't see how hiding the information is consistent.
---
And a lich king
---
they could always allow server transfers, i think that would have been the better move.
---
Just a side note, you don't have to learn every new spell on level up, some are going to be fairly useless for you right now so only pick the ones that you're going to use/ are beneficial for you right now.

It's not, though, Blizzard wants to phase it out by Phase 2, and even originally wanted it only for the launch period. One whole phase duration is an extremely long time for people to abuse early economies.

This post is a failure more than Asmongold. Why are you seeking your social gratification through Asmongold? He isn't your friend. He doesn't owe you anything. You're not the wow police. He can play the game any way he wants. You either like it or you don't.
---
What you don't do is make a post about how much of a failure he is because he upset you. This is next level weird
---
Don’t know if it’s been fixed, but AAP has some really awful bugs in it right now. Might give it a while to work out the kinks.
---
Server populations are many times higher than what they were in vanilla launch. I played the second week of vanilla and even layered servers are significantly more packed than Illidan was at launch.
---
logged into netherwind, saw portuguese scrolling in general, logged out

---
But the orcs were corrupted by the blood of demons and evil warlocks etc, turned into raging brutes. Was that really their fault?
---
DM-VC.
---
Your side loses good day sir
---
no it doesn’t.
---
Not at this stage, layering is probably the issue and should make it feel better soon, plus everyone's now spread out leveling. Give it a month or two and you'll be seeing loads of people all the time.

At what level do mobs stop dropping linen cloth and go to wool cloth? I’m 18 and on he tailoring grind, but having a hard time advancing because all the mobs I farm are only dropping linen cloth.
---
I did, and I also played the first two as well. Doesn't really change my perspective that the Alliance had pretty good reason to look up the Orcs.
---
Another idea, if they have one-time permanent layer transfers and then disable layer hopping all together?
---
He had whirlwind axe too. Some people are just super entitled to loot they want.

Soooooo...is Hitler a thing your guild talk about a lot or...?
---
Right now everybody wants money and are picking up gathering professions, so I'd advice you to keep both mining and engineering for now since you won't make much from skinning at this point, while engineering is the best profession and mining will only get more profitable as the game goes on
---
Do you remember about where you were at gold wise earlier on in levels? I'm a little bit into 29 and have 23-24 gold right now. Have to spend about 5 gold on needed spells at 30, which will leave me around 18 gold right after hitting 30. Curious if you remember your gold amounts prior to 40. I e been skinning from the get go and plan to grind a few levels between now and 40 on beasts, but have otherwise been solo leveling through quests. Congrats on the mount!
---
I considered writing a little about this but decided against it because the post was already long and complicated as it was. There are situations where pre-HoTing the tank can be perfectly okay because the HoT won't actually build aggro on the healer until the *healer* enters combat with the mobs. 
---
So tossing HoTs on the tank if you know you can sit down and drink during the start of the pull and not have to get up and panic heal and enter combat can be a valid tactic, but it requries care, knowledge and probably more faith in the tank than you'll usually have in a random dungeon group.

---
I really hope that realm transfers and name changes never come to classic. Back then you built a reputation and bad/toxic players became known so you could avoid them. They couldn't just transfer or name change when their reputation dropped low enough meaning there were social consequences for being a ninja looter or something equally awful.
---
I’m a mage, I buff everyone I pass and offer food/water to those who buff back if they can,  and food/water to those who can’t if they acknowledge the buff. Classic is a community that needs each other, the grind is hard so whatever we can do to make it easier for each other is what we should do
---
I, too, look up to people with mold in their room for months.
---
Good boy
---
yeah, kind of a shitty way to waste peoples time.
---
Elaborate please
---
In the 14 years i've been playing the game i can count the amount of friends i made in it on one hand. That said I met all of them in raiding. Im trying to meet people in classic by grouping with them and helping them but it never goes anywhere after that

---
I'd say it's the best music in the game too
---
Seems like this breaks rule 7 *eyeroll*
---
Dps probably the easiest. You only have 1 healer and 1 tank in a 5 man, so if you're playing either of those roles and you fuck up you'll probably wipe.
---
If 1 Dps player isn't that good it'll just mean you progress through the instance a bit slower, but the other 2 Dps should still be able to carry you.
---
But who was phone ;\_;
---
this is the type of never give up mentality i like to see

Wait till you log in, the Alt f4 plug in cord and relaunch game.
---
A warrior taking ravager over whirlwind is a dipshit anyway
---
Interesting that they nerfed it right after the world first competition. Why are we seeing no bans or roll backs for those who exploited this bug? If this happened in retail we would see people banned, just look at preach recently with the xp potion exploit. 
---
I find it a bit suspicious that they nerfed this almost immediately after the competition ends. Almost like they didnt mind streamers exploiting, but us average Joe's with jobs and lives dont get the same advantage. Kinda like they want us to be logged in longer than we usually would be.
---
Yeah I getcha, I'll keep that in mind before I post next time. My bad!
---
I experienced my first node-napper again today. I turn off auto loot for node just in case. We shared some laughs and gestures, I wasted a couple minutes of his time, that's all I could have hoped for.
---
So
---
Try to make them attack one mob, that way you can leave it, build aggro on the other mobs, and then taunt the dps mob back if it's still alive. That's how I usually do it. 
---
The real annoying thing is dps that insist on pulling. If I don't get the initial threat I'm almost useless as a tank, I need them to hit me to get rage so I can do anything.
---
The Twitch add-on client search literally doesn't work that well. Sometimes it just doesn't return matches, even for known results. The most reliable method is usually using the actual name of the addon.
---
Hypothetically say that the Orcs were 100% tricked into being corrupted and were by no means complicit (which is debatable) - does this mean that the Alliance is going to give them the benefit of the doubt? I really don't think so.
---
not rly, why?
---
This is poor advise, there are lots of spells that are not useful.  
---
As a shaman I definitely don’t need sentry totem, and hunters definitely don’t need eagle eye.  
---
  
---
You can get them later on once getting money is easier and miss nothing
---
Understood, thank you very much.
---
Hopefully they never get a better weapon than Thunderstrike.
---
Pulling aggro 
---
Aggro means that an enemy mob gets aggresive and attacks you. 
---
You can get aggro by walking to close to an enemy or attacking it. 
---
If you attack a mob you build a resource called threat. High damage = high threath. The more threath you build the more the mob wants to attack you. 
---
Tanks have a lot of threath building abilities (some do damage and threath, other only threath.) If the tank have more threath than you, then the mob will focus the tank while you damage the mob. 
---
When you pull aggro, your threath resource surpasses the tanks and the mob will start attacking you. 
---
The better tank you have the more you can damage the mob.
---
Lighten up dude
---
I've put every BoE that I don't need onto the AH so far. Something like 95% of them sell within 24 hours. Doesn't need to be over priced to get you more money than vendoring.
---
No, don't rush to 60. The game is just as enjoyable getting to Max level. (I enjoy it more than raiding).
---
ofc also you can level gathering proffesions while stockpiling mats. I'm leveling skinning/mining while stockpiling mats for tailoring and engineering on one alt each.
---
It's funny, I'm playing horde with my husband but alliance on a PvP server just for me, switching gears is weird lol
---
I stand corrected. Happy vanillaing!
---
Me :)
---
This is brilliant xD
---
What? You are completely misunderstanding the concern - the concern isn't the amount of mats it's the control of those materials. If one guild can control an entire supply they can price gouge and suffocate the server.
---
I love playing WoW but after a while, I feel like I’ve wasted time that could be used to do stuff around the house or studying/learning stuff for work.
---
Give your balls a zug
---
Pug and join a guild. I grouped with 2 random people in Mulgore Friday for some quests and we spent the rest of the night questing together, playing over the weekend, etc. Not everyone will want to be your friend (just like real life) but it will happen eventually
---
I'm still looking for Gaycory on Herod
---
I've met a lot of friendly miners that share their skill up. I also share my node if someone is running up to it while I'm mining. If someone shares with me i just mine, but don't loot.
---
What do I do when the queue ends but I can't just jump on to my computer and play
---
You are still missing the point. Streamers are using their viewers as personal armies. There is nothing wrong with Let's Plays. All the streamers you listed give special rewards, shout-outs, and play with and use their personal army for their donators. It's orwellian and sick. Luckily there are actual communities out there that have a strong emphasis on groups of people over a celebrity with a tip cup.
---
Just got home from basscenter in queue currently
---
Its lit bruv
---
It is possible to have your shit together and have a lot of free time to play but I’d say it’s rare to have as much free time as you did when you were a kid and be accomplished. And maybe accomplished (whatever that means)  isn’t what you want, that’s fine, but don’t be surprised when people show up 15 years later and say they don’t have as much time.
---
Yep those have been my findings as well. It's really crappy
---
No it should not...... are you on drugs. The idea is to theoretically run the entire instance without stopping for mana breaks, which is very possible if your healer is well geared and the lock knows what he is doing. 
---
Everything that a lock can do to self heal or make shards is lower dps than normal play. 
---
So you have an issue here, if the group is overall weak and the healer is having to stop to drink every few pulls.... then the warlock should get with the program and do the same. If the tank is well geared and doing a good job as well as the healer then he is likely always at 80% mp or above and he can easily support a single large heal to the warlock every 2-3 pulls or a hot between every pull.
---
Yes obviously i know this but is it just pure frostbolt spam?
---
I've been disenchanting the gear I don't nerd. Am I Being a fool?
---
Sheep your assignment and make sure it stays a sheep.
---
Does cat form give speed to druids?
---
For real. I’ve been trying to play, but now I have two kids and a demanding job....fuck. Al I want is to grind away with my mage.
---
&gt; Ferals *can* easily have top DPS in what WoW is for 98% of players.
---
Is what you said and the main gripe people are having with your argument. A feral can't top dmg unless the other players are exponentially worse than him and thats just the truth of the matter. If you're going to try to spin it and claim a majority of players wont even hit 60 or the hardest content theyll ever do is ubrs than why even speak up in the first place.
---
Ok thx
---
Paladins have near unlimited Mana due to a crit based talent. They have poor ability to heal party wide damage however. 
---
Druids have hots however because of this can generate a lot of threat in late dungeons and raids. They have the only in combat rez in the game.
---
Priests have bubbles to prevent damage and decent multi target raids. They get access to two different talents trees for different kinds of healing.
---
We don't need this bullshit content. People don't care about you. They don't care about your SO. And they definitely don't care about some cookies.
---
People care about:
---
* Shitposts
---
* Memes
---
* Actual wow classic content
---
This is none of those
---
Generally you shouldnt aoe in dungeons, just single target frostbolt. Tanks dont have many tools to hold threat on groups while leveling. 
---
If you have a group of mages then everyone doing aoe can be viable.
---
Nobody knows
---
they get banned for asking to be unbanned when the mods do their biased work
---

---
She may get mentions in TBC since Vashj is a raid boss and is one of her generals or something. I don't remember if her name comes up or not.
---
Let us die, generally. In my experience, locks who tap down low are also the group that can’t manage aggro. We have plenty of ways to heal ourselves if we want (healthstones, first aid, cannabalize, food, etc) so if the warlock won’t do those things, let em die. Remember, they’re essentially stealing your mana, and your mana is much more important then ours.
---
sssssshhh they are not aware. Let them believe that maths is ahrd.

I'm level 41 now.  I keep bumping in to people I did quests with at level 4, dungeons at level 18 and 32 and group quests at 37. 
---
It's the best part of the game.
---
I'll be doing this for the disgusting oozeling
---
Shatter is when mages start to be fun imo.
---
I'll try to get a recording.
---
I usually tell my groups to auto attack and wand things until they see two sunders on something and then they can use real abilities on that thing. 
---
But like others have said in this thread if you have at least three points in Tact Mastery then you can charge + auto then swap to defensive and Demo Shout for snap threat on everything.   Sunder the main threat twice and then Bloodrage into another Demo Shout.  Then try and get a Sunder on each mob.   With good dps or high HP targets and three or more targets your probably going to need to swap focus your Revenges on the main target.
---
Another piece of advice is to bind Mark Skull and Cross to comphy keybindings and use them every pull.  Most people know what markers mean what.  Note that I have f1 as Skull f2 is Cross then in CC order after that (Moon for Poly, Star for Sap, Diamond for Banish, Circle for Shackle and then Square for Trap on f7).
---
Nice dude. Grats on making that much and the house.
---
It's not bad, but you want to be careful. 
---
It's really easy to find yourself closing in on lv40 and having nowhere near enough money for your mount.

What are some decent normal ruleset servers for Alliance eastern timezone? English speaking. I am interested in raiding. Not sure which to pick.
---
cept the people who mail you shit that never arrives
---
Wrong, they are gonna add content to classic, just like old school runescape did. Whats gonna happen is a full blown relaunch of the game. People are gonna stop playing retail, classic already has 10x the population of retail. You are just in denial, nobody is going to play retail except for like 100 whales who are afraid to lose their store bought mounts and achievement points.
---
That guy quoted his best song too
---
45 hours a week? Either you have other stuff going on, or I think you're lenient with the word "barely".
---
Got to play all weekend thanks to memorial day. First time I got to play classic! Not for any reason other than just being too exhausted after work.
---
Bump
---
1: The next row always tells you the requirements, most of the time it'll require x points in the previous row/s before you can put any points into it. Other times a certain talent will need to have points put into it before you can unlock it, it will always tell you the requirements. 
---
2: You shouldn't worry about what other people are doing for their builds, you're going to learn more about your class if you make the decisions for yourself, every talent is viable so don't bottleneck yourself because you're concerned about a meta that doesn't exist
---
I think you're worrying way too much about min-maxing/the meta this early, just play the game dude.
---
Why level 10?
---
i wonder where it could be from...
---
Stuff like this happens way to often.
---
Not jsut with chests btu with herbs and anyhting lootable too.
---
First day of release someone spammed clicked the herb I was looting, I failed, he clicked faster and got it. I just said ''rude...'' and he answered with ''thats vanilla''. I was furious about that sentence.  Does he really think everyone was an asshole back then? I jsut said ''okay then'' and walked away... its just an herb... but jeez
---
And a little bit of warm milk dabbled on your neck.
---
Certainly possible. I’m in the exact same boat, so maybe I’m wrong.
---
I just think that the percentages are going to be small comparatively speaking.
---
It’s classic, pretty much any 2018-2019 prebuilt pc is going to be capable of playing the game.  Buy whatever is in your budget that has an SSD hard drive and you’re good to go.
---

They ain't wrong ;)
---
Basing the fun level of any class under 20 isn’t going to do much for you. However mages can be on each end of the spectrum. A frost mage is generally going to be frostbolting and using blizzard a lot of the time which can be a little boring. There are a lot of frostbolts you pump out.
---
However mages are I think the most versatile, along with Druid, as there are a lot of really viable ways to play them. Frost, fire, arcane and mixing all of them together are all really solid ways to go. 
---
Mages also have a shit ton of spells and can do really cool things like teleport and make portals, sheep extra mobs, make endless water and food. Honestly I would say stick with a mage because they are a ton of fun.
---
So... Do you ask everyone's age before asking for a party invite?  Or is it just an assumption that someone acting poorly must be a teenager?  Because I can assure you that there are plenty of people 30 and up who are complete asshats.
---
Yes, exactly what I JUST said.
---
For a combat rogue spamming sinister strike, I've always heard slower weapons (with higher damage per swing) are ideal. Is this not true for 1.12 for some reason?
---
Yes, frost nova when the hunter pulls off tank
---
Considering most folks will actually have time invested in their characters as opposed to queue times, I doubt that.
---
No. 
---
The Dash spell and Feline Agility (?) talent do that.
---
well bgs and honor isn't coming for a while so probably not.
---
Ok thank you
---
So did you go back?
---
You will level up from zone xp eventually
---
Hilarious and spot on.
---
Its okay bro, we’ll just do the boss without you and wipe because of it
---
High level raids are not low level instances. 
---
I’m not a douche I’m just realistically looking at the game.
---
just single target tanks don't really have much AoE threat generation so casting blizzard or arcane explosion is pretty dangerous. 
---
I mainly just cast frostbolt, frostbolt, fireblast and repeat. casting 2 frostbolts before fireblast helps not rip threat off the tank.
---
Cast frost nova when needed and if you have a good group someone will mark targets. If you see them mark anything with a half moon symbol you should polymorph that enemy.
---
Doesnt /deaths work?
---
I did 😊
---
Yeah, i am a warrior AHAHAHA

Actually I’m just assuming . The majority of the time I see this behaviour , it’s from 16 year old streamer fan bois.

I'm pretty sure people blame you for q times and it will probably die down as the qs die down.  They wanna blame someone for there 3 hour wait to get on herod so they blame you.
---
You do know this works right? I do it all the time when I download a new addon and there's a que.... The game thinks you dc'd and let's you back in within a short amount of time. I think it's a 10 minute dc timer

Imo I’m planning to do those once I get my mount.

Had it rain in thunder bluff
---
I'm playing on an Aspire 1 notebook that struggles to run Minecraft, yet it can play Classic just fine. Hell, my phone has a better graphics card and processor than my laptop.
---
If you turn the graphics down to original classic, it can run on a potatoe.
---
Eh me and my friends have a list but it’s mostly just for fun. Adds some spice to the long leveling process.
---
I mean if we're doing a race to the bottom to go after who was here first, then Trolls win. But the Trolls' faction also decided to bring in the Forsaken, so...not a conversation about individual races rather the larger political faction they belong to.
---
Not really. I intentionally came back because it was funny. Do it again for sure
---
Tangentially related: if you're a rogue pickpocketing syndicate tokens off of mobs in Hillsbrad, kill the mobs you pickpocket! Otherwise some other poor soul (me) is going to come around, find every mob picked, have to go through and kill them and then wait for spawn to pick and kill again.
---
Clean up after yourself, don't be a dick.
---
I meant that may ready have the parts you were talking about but ok thanks
---
I'm sure that level 20 green will be very helpful later on bro
---
its a birb
---
I’ve just manually kept track of deaths. I’m sure I’m one or two deaths short, and it gets difficult to remember to mark a death in frequent pvp situations
---
think you see statues of her
---
Going to put this after this massive queue. Thanks
---
Yeah people go 3000 kills dry on a zulrah pet and the comments are always “you’re not even supposed to have one yet FOH” lmao
---
Isn't bolvar near katrana and anduin in sw?
---
You only got to level 8?
---
They only do it in M+, so people who confuse long grinds with 'difficulty' wouldn't see it.
---
Kupnip is my imp
---
"WTF that is such a shit bug!"
---
me when i see DM vs VC discourse
---
No. I have been killing with BS. Work on the level 20 mail gear, and the 18/20 Daggers. Getting 80s to 1g per dagger, and anywhere from 30-80s for armour.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
People hitting 20 sometimes have a hard time upgrading out of their level 10 questing gear, and also want shoulders (which you can craft at for lvl 17 and 20)
---
Yeah, kind of crazy... I wonder what happened... The larges queue I saw was last Friday at around 5pm it was at 1.4k and took about 15 minutes.. since then at peak it was around 600ish. Now it shot up to 4.3k... did 3k people really just join the server?!
---
It doesn't work right now guess you'll have to read the quests
---
Raptors have a close to 100% droprate for the heads, though. I killed exactly as many raptors as I needed heads.
---
Those thunder lizards, though... I murdered about 30 of those and only like five of them had any *blood* in their veins.
---
Some people are just that invested in others man...
---
Glad I took enchanting then.  My standard of sell anything white or gray and de anything else is going to pay off, only in the sense that I'd waste more time than it's worth trying to squeeze 1% returns out.
---
Is this what is meant by a humble brag?
---
I right click the tab that says general and change the back ground color there.
---
I play max 3 hours per day, if I even get online that day.. Subscription feels kinda expensive right now ^^.
---
The Horde are bad guys trying to be good guys - and from the perspective of the Quillboar and Centuars, they are the new colonialists attempting genocide.
---
The Alliance are good guys who are slipping into bad guys.
---
Yes. It was many people's introduction into the MMO genre.
---
Yap! but it's fucking awesome ! ain't it great!? :D i LOVE CLASSIC!!
---
Not quite, have a 20 Human Mage that I currently abandoned due to high queue times on his realm. Remade as Horde on Deviate Delight and have a 26 Warlock / 11 Priest / 10 Warrior / 10 Hunter / 10 Shaman. I can't decide what I like best but so far focusing my Warlock.
---
By best tip is wait. You’re playing with the people who want to rush to max level. The chill people are still in the barrens and westfall
---
Hi, /u/Cronik

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to be low effort.

There is video of them in ZF with 7 people getting 150xp a kill.  
---
They had to know about this.
---
Open menu.  Open bracer location (bag, character tab).  Left click desired enchant.  Move mouse over bracer.  Left click bracer.
---
then go level in feralas where it still is and has been since 2004?
---
unless your point is that dungeon leveling is fastest so you're obligated to do it, which is true for both retail and classic, hence you'd never see it in classic either right?
---
or maybe you're just shitposting
---
It doesn't have your name on it. And the World of Warcraft isn't always a fair one.  
---
Deal with it.
---
because bre is way better on a warrior in pvp then it is on a pally. and a pally makes way more use out of rag then a war

S

Spam frostbolt or firebolt on your tanks target.
---
Is there an addon to count meaningless things like steps, jumps, how many times a speell has been cast, how many creatures killed of what type or how many items dropped, things like that.
---
"For any horde around level 26 stuck after handing in Bloodfury Bloodlines in Stonetalon:  
---
1) Pick up the quest "Calling in the Reserves" from Maggran Earthbinder just outside of the inn at Sun Rock Retreat.  
---
2) Fly to Camp Taurajo and run south towards Thousand Needles and hand in "Calling in the Reserves" to Grish Longrunner standing near the top of The Great Lift.  
---
3) Pick up from "Message to Freewind Post" from Brave Moonhorn who will be standing nearby.
---
\*\*If you still don't see AAP quest directions, continue with the following steps\*\*  
---
4) Type /aap reset
---
5) Type /aap skip (to get past the Chen's Keg quest)
---
6) Continue leveling in Thousand Needles!
---
At this point, my AAP addon directs me "Down Lift" and "Run to Waypoint (Turn in Quest)"
---
delete this

I'll take *"Things that didn't happen"* for 500, Alex.
---
Wow, you just totally changed that opinion of his, great job dude!
---
He was retailded.
---
People started watching streamers and want to desperately be them so they copy what they see.
---
Best case is start your own group and maybe stress that you're not doing some speed clear
---
I'm pretty sure it's you 'Murricans who're pronouncing it wrong, since, y'know, your whole version of the language is a bastardisation...
---
That would mean APES would not have gotten to MC as quickly.
---
There are videos of them in ZF in raid with 7 people.
---
They had to know that this was broken.
---
Back in vanilla you'd get 11xp when in raid. 
---
While APES was in ZF they were getting 150 with 7 in raid.
---
Kromcrush is the spot I dig it.
---
That's fine, I just hope you know exactly what layering is and how it works, since some people spread misinformation about it.
---
It worked, thank you! I thought i had to cast it on myself but its on an item
---
Thanks y'all :)
---
Agreed it would solve this particular issue. I dont feel like adding 20 mobs to every chest and rare spawn is either practical nor vanilla like.
---
I love 8.2 it is fun for once.
---
Well its only 15$. Give it a try and see if you like it.   Not much to lose here:)
---
Tbf, this is standard human etiquette. If they’re a jerk in game you know they’re like that irl too
---
Ya it’s all about fun for me! Don’t give a F about people out to rush
---
how does world pvp work now and in the future on normal servers?
---
In 'Murrica, maybe.  The rest of the English speaking world pronounces it the way it's spelled.
---
Ive been back to retail for a few years now but it always struck me as a new game (dont get me wrong i loved legion to pieces, set me up for disappointment with bfa), it feels good to be back.
---
Neat. Any way to do the numbers of the target?
---
Honestly healing has been an experience so far in pugs, or new tanks not understanding how healer mana works.(or rushing me about having to drink)
---
I'm making lots of money on the AH. Im in my low 20s almost at gold. This is with buying abilities etc..
---
Depends what you are trying to move I guess
---
This but with profession nodes.
---
Lol
---
He's right.  The "h" is only silent in 'Murrican.
---
It belonged to his papi.
---
Would be cool if there was a special quest line to rez the spirit healer. See who she really is.
---
Omg that's genius, why didn't I think of that
---
It's good yeah but it's fairly dated by today's standards of MMOs, if you have no experience in newer MMOs then you won't notice so yeah, go for it.
---
Ohhhhh
---
Now I get it
---
If you sound out the letters it doesnt work lol
---
&gt; How do they imagine the hundreds of gold being created?
---
Given the Vanilla version has been played by dedicated players for decades, it's not too odd to consider that people have optimized gold farming and the best ways to make buckets of rares/items with minimal effort.
---
When WoW was new, no one knew what the best thing to do was for gold, but nowadays the majority of people have rough ideas on the best places to farm and the best way to optimize farming. 
---
&gt; The massive gold sinks of mounts and skills will keep the total volume of gold very low on the server for a few months, if not a year. 
---
Yeah I agree with you, in my experience the whole twink thing came a long time after all the raids. From what I remember, a lot of players would get bored at 60 without anything to do, so they created alts that could stomp battlegrounds and invested their time in kitting out their alts. 
---
People have mentioned that these items will go up in value in 6-12 months, but I honestly think it might be longer given how long it took for twinks to become a big thing in Vanilla (Though that may be due to the later addition of BG's). 
---
&gt; Asking 25g for a level 19 twink item in retail is easy. Asking 10g for it in classic is dumb and will rot in your bags until 2021. 
---
Yeah, even some great blue BoE items are going for barely over vendor price at the AH. No one is spending 10G on a lvl 19 blue at the moment because there's so much other shit to buy that will help out more than the +2 stamina.
---
&gt;Could you have done so much more with 7g over two years, without a doubt.
---
Yeah this is my mindset, the 2-3G now is worth way more to me than the 50G I'll get 6-12 months later on for the same item.
---
God, this is glorious! DM forever!!
---
As a first time wow player the bonds I’ve already made with random players is amazing. Played a full quest line and got invited to a guild and they taught me some useful tips on levelling my warrior. Most fun I’ve had in a longtime with random players
---
Just vendoring?
---
AAP is only good till about level 40, then you're better off going your own way or use another quest guide.
---
It is.
---
Nice
---
For pvp I really recommend a bat or crab. You'll want to keybind their abilities on your hotbar so you can actually make effective use of them. If you're a night elf, you can get a Wintersaber for the fun stealth attack Aimed Shot.
---
Hahaha he's in my clan Crown. That's hilarious. Did he let you take the picture? Gotta tell him he's internet famous now
---
*Americas
---
That sounds terrible. I like to do that every once in a while, but now I get gourmet meals served to me when I get home from work. And having kids is the best! Wouldn't trade it for anything. Nothing humbles you and makes you more selfless than having kids and a wife.
---
I think they meant coins unless whoosh.
---
Never seen that background before
---
I find myself enjoying the little things more too!
---
What's happening here? Asking for a friend..
---
I disagree
---
You'll be fine. I'm just the healer
---
Maybe they have hoof rot
---
lolol a million points for "it is green."
---
I just tried logging to sell shot before bed.  84 minute queue.  Maybe tomorrow after work.
---
You may notice it seems like a walking simulator at first til lvl40 but it surely is still a great mmo
---
Blizzard probably don't want to add more servers, or increase population for each server, since they expect lots to stop playing. I imagine they'll add server migration in due time. 
---
But yh, I can't fathom waitimg that long to play. Just reroll.
---
Wow you’re a dbag
---
Might I suggest the addon threatplates. Its classic-ready and allows you to take a quick glance at the nameplates to know what you do and don't have threat on. Super useful for new tanks, or old farts like me who are relearning the ropes.
---
I have to get up at 6am on the weekend just so I can play.. Its ridiculous
---
That's a good point. Most of our group is still leveling up. Maybe I should roll a tank in the meantime to control pace.
---
The gameplay is essentially the same. Think of is as a normal PvE server, only the players will occasionally be 'In Character' where they act/react as if their character was in the world. Kind of like your traditional DnD experience.  
---
You'll get your spread of chill people and weird assholes just like anywhere else, but it's basically just an outlet for creative writing in a collaborative space. One big plus side is that since players are talking in the world and going about their own 'lives', it helps make the game feel more alive. When a squad of six players in matching Stormwind Uniforms are marching around the city for example, it does add a little something to the flavour of the setting.
---
using a game mechanic is not abuse. Blizzard could easily prevent "abuse" if they wanted too
---
Id say now is the best time to gear up your twink. There are so many low lvl blues on AH its crazy. And they are also very cheap which wont stay long.
---
Objectively WoW looks extremely ugly but at this point everyone got used to it being almost the same over so many years.
---
World PvP!
---
It does not matter what game you are playing, people WILL min-max and or speedrun. I don't like grinding dungeons over and over because I find it boring no matter how fast it is, I quest mostly, I also do not like leveling and I skip through every single quest as fast as I possibly can. I much prefer the endgame content of grinding endgame dungeons, raiding and world pvp. 
---
Are you going to tell me that's not the right way to play either? You realize how crazy you sound right? Everyone can play their own way whether they are a streamer or not.
---
Basically Ice Lance
---
He’s roleplaying his namesake.
---
Huh ? :P For telling someone that he's admitting to account sharing and that it's not the best thing to do on WoW reddit ? Imagine being you who wants to see people getting their account banned..
---
I’ve been having a blast and can’t get enough this game is lit
---
There are so many flips you can do if you just craft and vendor right now that professions are good but not in the conventional sense. At least on Whitemane. I'm vendoring all of my engineering bombs because I get 3x more than I would if I sold the mats(cloth/ore etc)
---
People spamming the 2nd part, once the bot transforms he wont talk to you as he goes into stealth shortly afterwards.
---
Yes
---
Its wild the only reason I ever even get to play is because my gf logs me in while I'm at work I shouldn't have to do that to play a game
---
There are so many more things in classic than retail.
---
Threat considerations
---
Mana conservation
---
Group and Buff dynamics
---
Loot considerations
---
Crowd Control
---
Pull and Aggro dynamics. 
---
These all can be greatly ignored in retail due to changes in the game.
---
Things like the five second rule, CC DRs, Not being able to respec on the fly, lots of things have changed, it's a different game.
---
Don't tell me what to do
---
Life tapping with a voidwalker??
---
I use chrome remote desktop to log in and try to map it out so I get in game like 40 minutes before I get home. Then I use my phone to move every few minutes. I know people like me are what makes the queue long but I'm more concerned about playing when I get off work than I am adding another 1 to the queue lol.
---
Not really. It was one of the most hilarious moments in WoW history but if people started abusing that regularly it'd just piss the shit out of everyone's mood. That guy is literally unkillable. Even if your server could muster up a couple raids to kill him, he'd constantly be healing huge amounds of health by oneshotting lowbies. I think I remember that Blizzard had to reset the server back then. 
---
This is fun exactly once. It's good that it's fixed. Maybe they'll spawn him in SW and Org on April's Fools Day.
---
No you just want to take an entire groups role away so you can clear an instance 5 mins faster
---
The only reason I’m not playing is I’m burnt on vanilla from private servers.  It’s great content though and I’m happy for everyone.  I’m happily enjoying bfa aka Diablo 3
---
This made me lol.
---

If it doesn't work from Reddit I have the same invite link in the description of all my videos on YouTube!
---
Are you dumb? Locks have multiple tools to regen health that they take to increase their mana pool. It doesn’t take a huge amount of taps to get that health back up either as one of the main stats a lock should be building is Stamina alongside Intellect. The more stamina the more taps. The more taps the larger the mana pool.
---
At the same time this helps the lock keep up their DPS rotations at maximum ability with little to no need of the healers to heal them.
---
The same way you do irl. Talk to people
---
And then the node clapped.
---
I mean it is a douche move to ask for a COD then return it.
---
Gentlemen, milady...you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain...Jack...Sparrow!
---
Isnt absorb no longer a thing though? It saved me quite a few times when stuff goes south.
---
BUT ASMONGOLD IS USING IT SO IT MUST BE BETTER.
---
VC on Gorgonash
---
Well it’s only  really a walking simulator if you don’t plan ahead properly.
---
I don't even know if he knows I took it lol, I just waved and did /wait
---
Like any other mmo, it’s the people you meet along the way that make the difference
---
My friend wants to know too. What's with phone over tablet over monitor photo.
---
I always watch the mana of my healer, if it's 75% or more, I'll life tap down to about 60%.  If I get a renew tossed on me, I'll wait til it almost fills my health, then tap again a couple times.
---
However, if my healer has to drink after the fight, I have to drink too.
---
There is also video of them in zf with 7.
---
True
---
Right?  
---
I watched it on a whim the other day after getting an ad for it and I'm impressed so far.
---
People tryna level yo
---
See that’s my mindset man
---
3s is 3s
---
Don't forget that he healed tons of health every time he killed someone. So once he starts AoE bolting, there is absolutely no killing him ever.
---
It was a joke, dude. Most of my toons were leveled in Vanilla and BC. Still I think what /u/getabsolutelyshrekt is saying is silly because Classic forces us back out into the world to see things that otherwise we wouldn't bother seeing again because it's more efficient to dungeon level, so the screenshot of the OP is a valid revelation about wow look at this thing that I otherwise wouldn't have seen.
---
Not at all.
---
lmao no, she thought she was selling to the vendor
---
but was destroying the items instead
---
Do you have a font addon?
---
Well it’s clear you don’t play the game.
---
Worshiping trees?   Are you sure you aren't talking about alliance?
---
Azeroth Autopilot has it
---
The way threat works in Vanilla/Classic you simply can't start blasting AoE immediately on the pull without pulling off the tank. After a few seconds, once the tank has had a chance to establish a proper lead it should be safe to use some AoE spells and abilities. 
---
Lots of tanks don't know what abilites give them the most threat in different situations though, so this isn't always just a DPS problem. Are they not using Demoralizing Shout/Roar, for example? Is the warrior only using sunder armor on one mob?
---
It also helps to know the differences between tanks. Druids will be a bit slower with generating threat on big packs for example. They don't have an equivalent to warriors sundering a different target every global cooldown, so instead have to use Demoralizing Roar and switch between targets and spamming maul, which only comes out every 2 seconds. This means it will take a little longer for a druid to get threat on big pulls, but if you let them do it they can hold onto packs just fine.
---
I'm a priest too. You'll be fine. Inner fire + pws means you won't take too much damage.
---
Use your succubus
---
Humble cheese merchant.
---
I'm heavily vested into bullion futures
---
I have 2 bank alts just loaded with copper, bronze, iron, stone, strange dust, essence, etc
---
I picked up mining and herbalism on my mage for maximum component accumulation
---
I will switch to engi/alch later and sell all the excess mats probably several weeks from now
---
Flabbergasted, I say.
---
Your really missing out on some of the best times and I haven’t noticed any difference since vanilla, people everywhere
---
You do you man, but like semi-hard core/hardcore players are 35-60 right now.
---
Does higher fishing skill cause bites to happen sooner into the cast?
---
Typical horde killing lowbies since they get rolled by players their own levels
---
I am a warlock. What's a good add on that tracks the timer on my dots?
---
Is there any way for me to download this and wander around?
---
It would have taken them probably about another day.
---
The issue I have is that we will never really know now the exact time it would have taken.
---
Without flying you'll die of old age before walking from one end of a TBC zone to the other.
---
The want to chain pull is annoying. Like at least let me out of combat for one second so I can drink while yall flail around.
---
The oom mage would appreciate it too.
---
US shadowmoon too, even as a horde we called it VC.
---
Honestly sir, I have already subscribed. I just wanted to know how easy it is to get into the game. 
---
For example I wouldn’t recommend my favourite game (Rust) to someone who doesn’t have hours upon hours of experience of first person shooters, because the game has a really steep learning curve. 
---
And if you don’t have the skill you gonna have a really bad time. 
---
And I don’t have the skill in mmos, that’s why I asked.
---
oh yeah what was DBM called in vanilla?
---
K but that happens all the time on that sub (ie anybody that disagrees with the hivemind assessment of balance is bad at the game etc) , it really doesnt seem bannable, i see no personal attack, inciting of witch hunting, or really anything at all except a potential trigger.
---
Not this time, sport.
---
That build becomes hilariously awesome once you get a trinket whose name I forget from Nefarian.  Turns your arcane shot into arcane explosions.
---
You need the azshara fp
---
Make friends with a chill tank or become a tank. Tanks are who control the pace of the dungeon so now would be a great time to grab a shield.
---
Wits, as in dimwits
---
Doesn't answer your question but I've run into way more nice people than assholes (outside of barrens chat, of course) on Blaumeux Horde. Maybe switch factions? :-)
---
World of Skyrim confirmed xpac?
---
i killed this guy today and he dropped nothing :(
---
EU Dreadmist
---
Me and my SO are looking for a mature guild to join. Up for dungeons and raids eventually (we just started classic and are only lvl14). :)
---
Not at this point. They definitely have not ruled out the possibility though.
---
hope you reported them
---
Get your Last Podcast on the Left listening ass into my inbox so I can find out what realm you play on and make a friend
---
It seems too. Most of the time it seems like its about 7 seconds.
---
You were in a layer crash, and when layers crash, they don't get server protection. It's strange.
---
There no way that milk is 'ice' cold !
---
Sounds like an unhealthy relationship
---
So I guess it's up to you, you can either bank them, keep levelling your mage and roll a twink in the future, or you can put your mage in a major city, make sure you don't discover any new zones and wait for BGs to be added into the game haha.
---
There's dozens of us!
---
Spicy take
---
Seriously though,  can we all form a pact that we won't corpse camp unless it's rightfully deserved.  I haven't had it happen to me yet and I've been ganked several times.  I always advise my guild mates to not camp,  but I still know it happens.  There is no honor in corpse camping.  Attacking a member of the opposite faction right after respawning is no challenge.  Come up,  gank,  be on your merry way.
---
Nobody has any money
---
Hold mats (ore, bars, cloth, etc.) on an alt or vendor leather
---
25g seems really low even at this stage. He got a good deal.
---
Dungeon leveling is more efficient in classic too so what you're saying is silly.
---
Start your own group. Be the change that you want to see.
---
I like how he’s dazed and confused
---
Yes. I got messages on my Druid all the time before I rerolled
---
Yup.
---
Same.  
---
Get lost. Enjoy the world. Read the quests. Don't just follow an arrow everywhere.
---
If your have other addons that modify unitframes, like CT_UnitFrames, then it won't work. You may also have to turn on the option to show health numbers in interface options.
---
Uuuhhh...
---
“Bum-rush” is a term. Not an insult. He didn’t call him a bum. The hyphen is missing so I looks like he called him a “warlock bum...”.
---
It’s just the edgiest class/race combo

&gt;vouls
---
I can't seem to get addons working.
---
I installed an addon here: 
---
C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns\Questie-v4.0.14\Questie
---
(also unzipped it), but doesn't seem to be working. What am I missing?
---
iirc nathrezim do not ever truly die but I could be mistaken, long time since I read the lore.
---
:O
---
GIVE THIS MAN A MEDAL
---
This is the quality content I come here for
---
Because I'm stuck in the queue
---
I mean considering it’s literally all over google and the blizzard servers, I’m really not sure what you’re attempting to argue? 
---
It’s fine to just admit you’re wrong man.
---
Yup, even horde side called it VC on shadowmoon
---
Should have played “He’s a pirate”
---
a problem solver
---
Red is dead.  Words to live by.
---
Elemental anything, meats, light feathers, fish, etc etc
---
Which you should have by the late teens, if we're being honest
---
You dont have to come here and try and validate your actions. Pretty gay tbh.
---
Hey, I also played in Meet in Kargath, Kalecgos.. Best guild I was in
---
Saw the trailer 3 days before the first episode came out and thought it looked interesting. Did not think it would become one of my favourite shows
---
Swim to Westfall next time from GG.
---
Shhhh. Just let it happen.
---
Honestly most movement should be done through the mouse. Hold the right mouse button and move the mouse to turn, hold both mouse buttons to move, etc. 
---
Then use the WASD hand to use abilities and target. Tab target with your pinky finger and use the rest for the numbers or another keybindings you might want to make. That will lead to the greatest success with the game.
---
The Alliance are a metaphor for the priveleged races of earth. Humans = American whites. Dwarfs = European whites. Gnomes = Nordic whites. Night Elfs = Japanese.
---
The Horde represent the oppressed races of earth. Orcs = Africans. Trolls = Carribeans. Tauren = Native Indians. Undead = Australians.
---
/s
---
Sorry but hes on a different layer now.Never gonna see him again
---
Everyone minsintepreted what I had said. I wanted to say that I'm 15 and noone wants to take me to work anymore and that those 60$ are from school and they aren't even monthly pay, they are over the course of 5 months.
---
Thunderclap is pree good. Maybe some cleaves?
---

I had multiboxed! So there isn’t much research to do.

Tanking is fun. I agree. Thing is, you can do it without speccing prot because warriors are natural tanks and you’ll have almost all the skills anyway. What happens when you spec prot however is you lose all the skills that help you when you’re not tanking. So you’re amazing the 10% of the time when you’re in a dungeon and frustrated the 90% you aren’t. Whereas you stay arms spec and you’re still a good tank but you can actually enjoy the game outside of a dungeon.
---
I guess I’m not meeting the right people. Everyone I have played with so far leaves group right after we finish the quest.
---
This is WAY off on druid, but it requires a lot of work. Druid can main tank all but 6 raid bosses (alliance all but 2) and do as well or better than an equal geared warrior through phase 4. Gear isn't as easy to evaluate on druid and even in phase 6 you'll be wearing stuff below level 60 or the current tier. Warrior is more cut and dry for a guild MT but druids by far make the best OT.
---
Again, Druid takes a lot more effort and farming.
---
I've had chests despawn on me that were clearly looted beforehand. Anecdotal but there it is.
---
Belle Elfine 🧝‍♀️
---
Even if that is true, they all have exactly the same value when it comes to killing virtual dragons: Zero. 
---
The raid shouldn't care what someone does in PvP, it's irrelevant.
---
That said, DKP solves the issue really. It's only something of concern to raids that do Loot Council, or Restricted DKP.
---
Just because they're fighting to survive doesn't make them good. They're evil and deserve to be eradicated
---
Yea I'm currently in line as well, position 4000.
---
Just want to play man... I already switched servers 3 times because blizz said to do it. Not sure what else to do cause I'm not starting fresh and ditching all my progress.
---
Renew is awful for mana efficiency and speed.
---
I can just flash heal for almost the same mana and more health.
---
Labor Day in the US today means more people can play more frequently. The servers ain’t bad, I went for it an hour ago and it was at 40-50 min or so. Perfect amount of time to do some stretching, water the garden, grab some tea.
---
Me too. My heroes of the storm name was changed from Gaymom because it's "offensive" despite me being, in fact, gay.
---
Just use your left hand for it all. 
---
If it's easier for you, 't' can also do what tab does. 
---
You can rebind 'a' and 'd' to strafe instead of turn which lets you free 'q' and 'e' to be bound to hotkeys as well as 'r' and 'f'. 
---
I personally use 1,2,3 and 4 because I don't find it that easy to jump up to the upper half of the numbers so I've got my other number keys bound to other keys around wasd.
---
&gt; Honestly most movement should be done through the mouse. Hold the right mouse button and move the mouse to turn, hold both mouse buttons to move, etc.
---
Life changing lmao. Thanks!

Those dots... why do they take so long to tick! and yup, always a mage stealing it

Reminds me of LGR.

I've just seen enough in-game weather to recognize what is happening :)

Not only that, but 15 freedom bucks takes a lot less time to earn than gold.
---
It's optimal to do green/yellow/orange/red quests for rep
---
Greyed out quests don't give much rep
---
I swap back and forth between IF and SW once i hit 20 on my mage to scoop up all the Wetlands and Darkshire quests. Maximum rep mode! On a human, no less
---
Retail is ridiculously dumbed down compared to vanilla. Nobody even knows what an LoS pull is anymore on retail. CC is just a random button most dps doesn't even put on their bars. Trash is not threatening. You're not limited by resources. Even if you wipe, there is no punishment, you just pop back at the start of the dungeon; the corpse run is completely removed. They completely removed the mechanic of tank's threat ceiling; if a DPS pulls they won't die. Later in vanilla they absolutely will. Right now they're just making all the healers and tanks quit and solo level lol.
---
Basically any group of half baked dogs could complete a dungeon in retail. Even M+ isn't that hard until you get over 10. And that depends on the affixes. 
---
Retail mentality = GOTTA GO FAST!
---
Classic mentality = The hurrier you go the behinder you get.

You're welcome! I'm glad you're getting good use out of it!

That's why I threw in the secondary part to absolve the dude if they were

&gt; There has not been a single positive BFA post on this sub
---
I think, for a lot of us folks that started wow at 10/10 and watched it dwindle to 1/10 over 5 really good and 10 really bad years, they're trying to demonstrate a strong demand for something that has routinely disenfranchised them. While I think that's the wrong way to go about it I definitely understand it. Hell I've routinely heard on discord that people are really sincerely hoping retail takes some design decisions from classic and I think *that* is the right path overall (and a much more positive message, it's the same company folks).
---
That's what makes the game fun for me. The graphics suck, the UI is simple, but the community is what I love. I hate how in retail you can go through an entire raid without ever talking to anyone. In vanilla and now in classic you struggle if you solo. 
---
Also for battlegrounds every server is self contained. If you keep getting murdered by some punk on the other faction there is a chance you could see him out in the world and exact your revenge. 
---
Those things are what make classic superior.
---
We've all been there! Have fun!

OCE Horde Remulos server. level (almost) 32 mage LF guild. I had to leave my old one after it hit 600 players. I despise those mega guilds. I'm looking for a guild that can be chill, and also is not a mega guild. Looking to actually know and talk to people, not sit in a huge guild with 0 chat.
---
Everyone misinterpreted the post, while I do agree the money should go to charity as I don't NEED the play the game as much as people need a cure for a disease or help with rehabilitation or anything else really. I am 15 I cannot legally work anywhere and trust me I've looked for places, those 60$ are from the good grades in school and they aren't monthly they're spread over 5 months.
---
AoE grund is fun, but difficult because if competition for sports, also they can be from other the other faction and kill you. 
---
Also, I don't think it is possible to watch TV and AoE grind. It is not that easy as one mob not slowed can ruin the pull and kill you.
---
This is me now. I will just let it lapse. All my younger friends or friends with out the same responsibilities as me are too far ahead of me now. 
---
I will just stick to something that lets me play when I want to play.
---
Very nice setup brothers! Enjoy experiencing WoW outside!
---
Raid fights often require more than one tank.
---
Unfortunately this is the reason I abandoned Incendius for now. I am Alliance on the server and got my Mage to 20 but couldn't deal with these queues anymore. Rerolled to Deviate Delight and have had no issues since. Still a super busy server but no queue times so I'll take it.

Let me blow your fucking mind real quick.

You don't need a time traveling USB stick to have 20 year old data on a USB stick.  Believe it or not, you can interface a USB stick with whatever storage your 20 year old data is on, and suddenly you have 20 year old files on a USB stick.
---
So the joke is, the kid could show up with the old code from 20 years ago on a flash drive because he had access via his dad to the original code, not that his dad had a fucking flash drive from before flash drives were invented, you dolt.

More like remember their names/pop them on ignore and don't run with them again. That's a thing you can do in vanilla.

Why do you put gay in every single internet alias you have?

Is your entire identity your sexuality?

I've been on private servers for 4-5 years.

I'm enjoying Thalnos. At worst peak times will have a 2 hour queue prob go down after this holiday weekend. No one has hit 60 on server. Highest alliance was 55 earlier todau

Nah, I get that. I am off today as well due to Labor Day. I got on today around 1:30pm. Figured it would have been more busy at that time but I got in with no queue. Just found it odd there was the largest queue I've ever seen at 8pm ET with a workday tomorrow.
---
Because for many of us who started playing in. Classic all of the changes over the last 15 years have been a betrayal of the core game that we really loved. BFA is fine for what it is, but it is not the same thing as the game we fell in love with. Classic is call back to a different era and type of game which is meaning fully different, but for those of us who loved the things that make Classic what it is, BFA and the progression to it was a road littered with betrayal.
---
As for the idea that BFA has better gameplay, higher difficulty and more complexity that is simply not true. At the absolute highest end of raiding/mythics/PvP, sure Retail has a higher skill ceiling. The problem is that skill floor in retail does not exist. The requirement to finish the latest tier of content is have a pulse. There is zero reason to ever go beyond LFR, so the base game most people experience is about as difficult as walking up the stairs and accepting the first quest in the undead starter zone. There is challenging content in retail, but the game is not challenging. The skill ceiling in Classic is much lower but the floor is also much higher, so most people who play classic will find it to be more difficult than retail.
---
If that's what they want then by all means. You arent paying their subscriber fee for them are you? Who gives a hoot.

Different strokes for different folks. Nothing humbles me more when I go 2 weeks without doing laundry and I realize I have on my last pair of boxer briefs.

I started playing on release of classic and didnt play wow before. Been playing csgo for the last 5 years
---
I really like it. The areas are confusing but i find questie helps alot to figure out where to go, you will still spend alot of time walking. Im currently lvl  30 undead warlock, i am hooked!
---
But it doesn't have to be!  We made an [engineering gold making guide while leveling 1-150](https://wow.classicraids.com/guides/professions/how-make-gold-low-level-engineering)  it's surprisingly easy once you focus on the profitable side.

Ravager meta is indisputable

Go into any twitch stream and it was like 3+ warriors spinning and 3+ mages dropping blizzards on top of them

Na. The corpse run is the most vanilla part. Although that one isnt too far.

Oh, you think you are addicted to WoW? Let the games begin.
---
So a little update... while still in queue my cheap ass wifi card crapped out randomly and I got disconnected from WoW. I plugged into ethernet and logged back in and it kept my position in the queue! Thought that might be valuable knowledge for anyone reading this, seems like there is a disconnection grace period in the queue as well.
---
I won't repeat myself just read one of the other replies to similar comments like yours. This whole post just made me look bad in front of everyone who saw it.
---
I love you, I hated not being able to see the classes by color. Thank you!
---
I love you both
---
WHAT. I have been hate-following it on Steam forever. I was convinced that game would be at least another 2 years away. Thank god. March 2020.
---
Worthshipping trees? This is you alliance folks.
---
Gear in your bags take damage too, no?
---
You had three tanky classes was the saving grace.
---
My friend followed me so he could get a snack and I tried to drown him. Am I a bad person?
---
Game of Thrones was at its best when it had the most cruel evil villain in Joffrey.  While you hate villains, the best stories require them.  In WoW that's what makes it so fun.  On a pve server you are supposed to hate them but you aren't really sure why and maybe you don't care. On a pvp server you truly learn to hate them.
---
I finally got a chance to start today and played to lvl 5. My buddy has a lvl 10 he wants to lvl with me. Does the 5 lvl difference mess anything up party wise? Will i get reduced exp on mobs or something if he helps kill? Should i just catch up to his lvl 10 or should he reroll and catch up to lvl 5?
---
 All the quests bouncing you from Westfall, SW and Redridge are shameless for this, you maybe get your flight costs back at best.
---
Questie shows Alliance Druids Darkshore and Silverpine Forest, I looked at it and thought "that can't be right" and then googled it to double check. Saved me a big hassle :)
---
Two questions
---
When I watch streamers AOE warrior tank, they spam demo shout (and only demo shout). They hold aggro from thee mages AOEing and the aggro doesnt break. 
---
When I try in dungeons, aggro breaks right away and I lose the mob to the mage. What am i missing?  
---
Also what is the appropriate warrior tank rotation. Single target and then AOE. 
---
For single target, i mark the one I want people to attack. I spam saunder and if I lose it I use taunt.
---
For AOE I charge in with battle stance, thunderclap, switch to defensive, demo shout and then just try use taunt on ways that run away and saunder one but I can never really hold aggro. Any tips? (im only lvl 40) 
---
Thanks!
---
Saved a ton of time with this addon. Quality stuff.
---
Which is all that matters here in America.
---
One without a 5k plus queue
---
Other than greed. Which I have plenty of.
---
Part of it is just how desirable warriors and mages are
---
They're the two most ridiculous classes in vanilla so there are a ton of them leveling right now
---
Once warriors hit the mid-late 30s with their AOEs and AOE proc weapons they go nuts
---
He’s a premature queue-estimator, don’t shame.
---
In special cases I google it. But that is about it.
---
It's actually the multiplayer EA release but I'll take it.

Only a lunatic would roll a male nelf.

Well, you’re level 17. Don’t expect too much. I’d say it picks up late 20’s
---
Haha yep 23.
---
Gz you got the window seat.
---
warlocks are nice in classic. i'm trying to enjoy my priest but leveling is brutal at times
---
What level of raiding are you doing if you don't have anyone communicating at all?
---
I mean you are kind of a dick for rolling on it over a warrior because its the single best weapon for warriors for like 12 levels when you are dungeons running.
---
How do you level first aid?
---
What the

say what you want but that man has *the* firmest e
---
Warriors are considered the exception to soloing because of how disproportionately they benefit from having a pocket healer, but even then, does the math back up that you're benefitting more than you're losing over the course of a grind/quest? You're trading 50% of everything to someone who does no damage.
---
"SellJunk" does exactly that. A button that sells every gray item. It doesn't have any config tho but it's still nice
---
I work under the assumption most people aren’t assholes and don’t steal tags and I have not encounter a single person steal a tag.
---
Serious question, how many times are people supposed to uproot themselves and upward of 40+ people that intended to play the game with and start all over, again? 
---
I'm sure in the boardroom Activ...I mean Blizzard is very happy with the costs and minimal risks being taken, but they are completely fucking things up for their customers.
---
Doing a masters, working and kids at the same time. 
---
Rest in peace free time. I think it's impressive you still decided to pursue a masters despite having other responsibilities.
---
I remember when I started playing I found a black one in, I believe, dustwallow marsh while questing. I used it and told my irl friends in my guild, not knowing how rare it was. Could’ve made a good chunk of cash especially considering I was still saving for one of my mounts. Oh well, I had that thing out 24/7. It was so cute.
---
Currently doing this!
---
You clearly haven't been playing the same classic. More often than not I see people helping with mobs weither they have tagged them or not. I have been helped when close to death by plenty of people, this a much more helpful environment than in retail
---
Yeah you should definitely quit then because it’s so terrible
---
It's just too bad that real night didn't come back.
---
Are there any addons that just show the mp5 generation tick bar? I saw a streamer using one but I couldn't tell if it was part of a full-on UI addon or a standalone addon.
---
Sagefish
---
We both had rezz sickness ma dude. I was killing him at the spirit healer and he kept rezzing lol
---
Also interested
---
maybe for you its not relevant but for others and myself it is. the same way i wouldnt give bre to a guy with 5 hks over the warrior who actually does pvp, even if it doesnt effect the raid
---
If you drop a main profession do you lose your skill in it if you then go back to it?
---
I always like it when there is interaction between community support and community.
---
In Dungeon Defenders I've often seen how a GM apparently watched us for a moment, because on the end screen you could see a GM name pop up.
---
And in Eve online during my test phase, a GM messaged me asking me how I'm doing. Then send me a 250 Page beginners guide PDF.
---
Like 85% because I got 10 in 12 kills. Sup.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Don't run prot.
---
You generate threat by doing damage.
---
When you hit 36, spec into arms.
---
Your rotation should be prebuilding rage, popping sweeping strikes, charging in, and popping a fat whirlwind. This is when you shield swap into defensive stance and pop shield block/revenge/sunders by tab targeting.
---
Threat = damge.
---
What server and faction are you playing?
---
OK that's a good thing, because otherwise the classic economy would already be wrecked. That's what I was worried about.
---
As I said in the tank section, unless you're doing some specific pull tactic the tank should pull as that will give them initial aggro on all the mobs. It's the default and what you should expect if you haven't agreed on something different. Even if you're doing something like sheeping or banishing on the pull you can still time the spells so that they land after the tank has gained initial aggro and there are rather few situations in a regular dungeon run where you'd want to deviate from that.
---
It was changed for balancing reasons (mostly pvp) 20 is the hard cap and you wont see a nameplate unless someform of the NPCs hitbox/Model is in view.
---
Imagine being proud of this
---
fire belching birb
---
And thanks to you, they've probably got to change their name now because it's going to be reported so many times.
---
Wrong. Partying up makes it so mobs are killed faster, resulting in more drops, with lower chance of dying, in shorter amount of time. I will party everytime
---
Not in Classic.
---
Have more then one monitor
---
Milk of a thousand ancestors mixed with an atmospheric Mulgore plains wind creates an updraft from the earth mother.
---
min maxing is the only right way to play that is not what is up for debate. Abusing game mechanics is not min max. Every speedrun community differentiates between pure speedruns and glitch-runs.
---
Is millions of dollars not rich?
---
I'm on netherwind. Seems to be a good PvP server.
---
What is spell cleave?
---
30 is where the leveling speed really slows down. One thing a lot of people start doing is dungeon grinding. If you get a solid 5 man group you can level to 40 faster doing dungeons then by questing solo. Especially if you dont know optimal quest routes.
---
Will do I'll tell him to check out the sub!
---
Yes, they wont be able to open the chest, itll ping them as nearby enemies opening a chest.
---
Also make sure you are using a gun instead of a bow.
---
Going the Old School route is pretty much the only way I can see this game surviving long term. Otherwise the serious players will eventually run out of things to do and it can't keep attracting new players with just the nostalgia factor.
---
Yeah lol
---
Ditto with shamans pretty much till higher levels haha
---
I read this in David Attenborough’s voice.
---
at first it was funny, but at this point its just sad
---
I'll be ready :)
---
Yeah. Depending on your starting zone there may be a trainer in the first town (after the tutorial area) or you may need to head into your race's capital to train it. By asking one of the guards, they can give you directions to various trainers, including the one for first aid.
---
It is a secondary profession that allows you to turn the cloth drops you come across while playing anyway into bandages you can heal yourself with. It is very potent in Classic.
---
I get that. I was really more interested in what you like about the 3 classes I asked about though
---
Understood. Still not understanding the ill feelings towards him.
---
You can't deny the facts mate. No matter what you do 80% of your time up to level 40 is strictly walking about.
---
Queues for Faerlina were deceasing, even during the weekend which was really surprising . However our pop. peaked back up to 10-11k Sunday night - Monday Night (9/01 - 9/02). I'm guessing it has something to do with the holiday.   
---
I'm going on a vacation out of town for a little over a week and I'll be keeping in touch with guildies to see what the queue trends are like at different times. I'll be posting on r/classic or other ppl's posts with any helpful info I can provide :)
---
Neat plan, good luck mate :). If you'd like to play in the mean time you're welcome to join me on the alliance side of the oceanic server Felstriker. I'm pretty casual, only level 14 so far, but am always looking for more friends!
---
I do have a thought regarding the new servers - there are already so many servers that don't have queue's (because they opened a whole bunch more) it would surprise me if they needed to open even more of them! They've actually started quite a lot, I'd suspect them to shrink down to a smaller number if anything. Although I'm not exactly an expert on this stuff.
---
That’s not a people that’s a good-boy.
---
Do you have a special font? Looks a look cooler than mine.
---
See I did this once, remembered they dont deshawn and ran back in the barrens for 5 minutes to clear it and make it despawn
---
I get that, but was really interested in hearing what people enjoy about the other classes I asked about
---
He is talking about the resolution of the texture.
---
Coca cola is addictive though.
---
Great and all, ultimately defeats the purpose of enjoying and experiencing classic content. It's cool that you guys did this and accomplished what you did, but it is absolutely the wrong message to be sending to people who have never tried classic before. 
---
Blasting through content as fast as possible is what made retail boring, you guys beat all the live content - now what? 
---
The pinnacle is fuckin boring.
---
yes
---
Fuck up sook...
---
Was killing some mobs on the Isles and ran into a chest where the mobs were dead. No one was around, so I decided to loot it. Mid opening this guy runs up and made up some bs rules about having to duel for the chest before opening it. 
---
Lol. That’s a new one.
---
I changed my font to Myriad Pro Bold, I prefer it over the default
---
It’s pretty petty to avoid grouping with someone who “stole” a dumb chest, it’s an open world. 
---
Deal with it. 
---
Also, with how huge the servers are and how unlikely it is for me to ran with you more than twice, it really doesn’t matter that a couple of children don’t invite me to their group.
---
Hello I am willing to trade the following names for in game gold or names on Herod:
---
Stalagg: Skeleton
---
Herod: Peonslayer, Memebank, Freetibet, Memeknight, Skelemage
---
Thanks for all the responses! Your answers make sense and maybe I just need to work with a group that’s more similar to my level to get the experience I’m looking for. Thanks for the advice, it gives me hope that I may still enjoy other aspects besides questing!!
---
seems a bit hypocritical but whatever floats their boat i guess
---
Elderscrolls online has lots of little areas like these and "delves" are their term for them. Something that can be done with or without a group but allows you to complete quests and obtain loot.
---
you're welcome maaaaate
---
Fun fact: Hemet Nesingwary from STV is an anagram for Ernest Hemingway.
---
Classic wouldn't be Classic if there was never those clutch moments you catch the boat within seconds, even milliseconds like this. This was definitely a seasoned player's skills.
---
*Should have done a 360° camera spin tho*
---
What kind of savage uses chrome
---
I did that three times and every time the server ended up filling up. I now have a level 30 and do not want to reroll on a different server and lose all my progression. 
---
I guess this is still my fault though for not moving to another server AGAIN.
---
How much does it sell on the AH?
---
Technicalities... his point is still valid even though dungeons are typically instanced - there are plenty of caves/crawler areas where grouping up makes it suck a lot less.
---
&gt;And just like i would never in a million years put a Porto jersey on (im a benfica supporter and member(soccer for you americans)), 
---
Uh oh
---
&gt;i would never in a million years play Alliance.
---
Phew
---
I did this in vanilla I'll never forget because we laughed like fuck and was slightly drunk (friend was on board)
---
I’m playing on a medium pop normal server (didn’t wanna go pvp until I actually know how to play the game). 
---
I’m a human priest, planning on following a Holy Priest build. For the simple reason I think healers are more wanted in groups then dps since everyone wants to be a damage dealer. 
---
Does this answer your question?
---
slap some runescape on that bitch call it WoW 2
---
Talking to blizzard support is the equivalent
---
When i first starting playing vanilla in 2006 I rolled a night elf druid because I was a 14 year old girl. 
---
This makes me happy I changed races and factions lol
---
so he can take a whiff why else
---
I do the same on my time off. I enjoy it though. Get some coffee and breakfast and start the leveling as the suns coming up.
---
Theres a pink haired gnome mage on skeram named vietcong.  10/10 would live in Stv ganking 24/7 with that name
---
It depends. As kid I didn't have a lot of free time due to mandatory schooling. In university I had tons of free time despite doing one of the more difficult degrees. Uni would only take up like 25 hours a week or so, though with some courses it sometimes spiked to 40. And some weeks I decided to do the bare minimum or take some off time and catch up later. Worked out fine. 
---
I get your point though, I do believe that people who work paycheck to paycheck should really evaluate what they're doing and how to improve on it. That stuff is just very uncomfortable to have such high dependency.
---
That's awesome! I just tabked RFC for the first time last night, too! Congrats!
---
I prefer 2 monitors
---
That design came straight from Everquest. One EQ dev was asked about why party members have their health bar visible but not their mana bar, and the response was that you could physically see how beat up and healthy someone is but you couldn’t see the mental strain and how much mana remains. 
---
Same concept applies for why damage amount is visible but exact numbers are not.
---
as a healer, i honestly love when the pull is just on the edge of being too big and we barely manage to get through it.
---
Is the Forsaken that bad though? They have free will now, sure their leader has some rather dodgy plans but does that mean the whole lot of them are bad?
---
Maybe short for Jayden/Jaydyn/Jaeden/however they're spelling it nowadays.
---
As someone who has been playing a rogue for 15 years I'm always torn about this. I've had groups of people get pissed at me for stealthing past them to an objective and taking it, but at the same time those people have *zero* qualms about powering past solo players, taking all the quest mobs and stomping through to the end to get the boss, running back out again and leaving everyone to wait on respawns. Yeah they can do that because they can group up.. but I can use stealth/distract/sap/other tools to solo stuff that you need a group for.
---
It really is a case by case basis, but personally if I've spent 15 minutes carefully making my way through an area, killing where needing and stealthing where required? I'm not obligated to give anybody else the kill just because they can't see me.
---
Granted it's usually resolved by me inviting solo players or ask for an invite to a group.. but groups *very* often are either full or just ignore requests. Which is fine, you don't have to play with me.. but I'm getting my mob/item.
---
If it looks that gorgeous it better be more friendly to first person gameplay.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers. Nice community and no queues!
---
And all of the recipes you picked up along the way.
---
The last time I raided seriously with a guild was Wrath. After that either I fell off or didn't get into the expansions enough to put in the time. 
---
What I'm excited for is 40 man raids. I raided in vanilla and nothing was more rewarding than grinding with the guild for months and months to get a single piece of gear. You really felt like you earned it back then. 40 people, sometimes for 8 hours. The struggle was real.
---
Alliance does it too.
---
I was lucky enough to find one on the first few kills (I knew it was rare but no idea it was THAT low drop rate). Haven't yet been able to sell it on my server (Myzrael). I don't think anyone who'd want it has enough disposable gold left (lowest asking price I posted was 15g, I'm not going to pull it from the AH and wait until people get their mounts etc)

He’s playing the way he wants. He already gave back to Vanilla fans for pushing for Classic. I think they can chill out a bit.

If you're flagged then you can be attacked by the enemy faction.
---
Shame that they missed legion. Such  great xpac.
---
Pulling and tank threat generation in retail wow is world's different than classic. Those DPS do the same exact shit in retail and it works out fine for them with them never taking aggro because of how braindead tanking is in modern WoW.
---
I turned to Weak Auras for this
---
There's one that does exactly that, it was posted on Reddit, sorry can't remember the name
---
Van Cleef, as in the guy you kill for the Quest you want to do. 
---
The name "Deadmines" isn't said anywhere, so people just LFG VC the same as LFG Hogger.
---
Came here to take a dump on SW.  The city is like 20 islands connected by bridges.  Annoying as hell.  Meanwhile, IF is a literal circle.  
---
IF &gt; All.
---
As a mage, just throw rank 1 frostbolt at it every 10 seconds or so. Keeps it slowed so it doesn't kill you without damaging it a lot.
---
I will check that outlet out. I've been looking at refurbs on newegg but didnt think of dell. Thanks! Happy cake day!
---
Hmmm I use Real Mob Health and only get the hp counter of enemies at the end of their bar. Maybe I need to mess with some settings
---
Wait there are enemy cast bar addons? That would be a game changer for me!
---
i saw it there. 
---
but already fixed it. had the retail version installed
---
Projecting? I have never played FFXIV. but whatever you say, little bitch
---
Higher DPS ALWAYS
---
lol I scared so many gnomes in wetlands as an orc hunter with this. None got away.
---
The reason YOU ARE on classic.
---
Gotcha ya... I figured it wouldn’t be much right now because of low economy, I know it once sold for quite a lot. Might be worth waiting a bit

You can just go retribution. Pop a shield on and you're good for a dungeon, no need to spend talent points on it.

Night elf is the best looking race!
---
Brother that's a horribly long diatribe to say little of substance. Obviously Staves of Jordan weren't going to cost 100g and now are going for 50s as a result, but the prices ARE affected, during one of the most crucial parts in the game's development period.
---
May I ask what addon your top bar is?
---
Mooo?
---
Nice nice, thanks for that! Having the stealth to get away from fights seems like it would be fun. Right now as a mage all I have is the close range aoe freeze that can be broken by damage or resisted completely. And often times it doesn’t save me
---
Just drown and spirit Rez and go AFK for 10 min.
---
Just got fury to level. The prot talents won't help you THAT much in 5mans, because they're just not that hard, and you're totally gimping yourself outside of the instance. Consider switching to Arms at 40 to get Mortal Strike. If you want to do prot, do it at the higher levels (55+) where the instances get a bit more challenging and you have enough prot talents to really make a difference.
---
In retail it’s basically impossible to pull threat and mana bars may as well not exist.
---
This means there’s no reason not to start aoe’ing thing as soon as they are within range of the spell.
---
If that's what you think then you haven't watched Cohhcarnage or lethalfrag. They epitome of the nicest most well welcoming communities out there.
---
No, he is claiming that a Warlock running on low health is no good to a party. When in fact, if played to it’s best, a Warlock played well rarely has full health and constantly runs the line of dying to provide themselves with a large mana pool, via their own health, while providing DPS.
---
If any of you read above looking for group i advertised to run rfc at lvl 30.
---
The thing is that tanks dont "grab aggro" like in retail. It needs to be built up. If the tank doesn't have aggro, they don't get hit, and if they don't get hit, they don't get rage, if they don't have rage, they can't get aggro. So starting the fight without aggro really fucks the tank up.
---
That’s just part of the experience.
---
I was lvl 41 before I went to sleep 4th on the server behind 3 hunters as a feral Druid. I was getting hundreds of supportive whispers telling me to beat those noobs. 
---
When I finally climbed into bed I was surrounded by bed bugs. I had to leave check into a hotel and I haven’t been able to play seriously since. 
---
My fuckhead apartment manager put me into an empty vacant apartment with no furniture or ac on a blow up mattress in hundred degree heat until the pest guy can get here.
---
This has honesty been the worst week of my life and I am a testicular cancer survivor
---
It's a super interesting experiment. Personally, I've played more wow this week than I have in 10 years.  I want to play every minute.
---
I am curious to see if others agree or if people abandon it. My guess is it actually attracts a huge number of people who stick with it
---
The character models look great but when it comes to environment it's really not that great. Every zone looks very generic, especially mountains look hideous.
---
wait...what? :( are you serious!?! i was REALLY rooting for henry cavill

This isn't a business transactions. I owe him nothing and neither does he us. He is tainting the experiece he pushed for by abusing mechanics that are only there because there was no other way.
---
Damn what was I thinking! Earlier I went for a walk cuz the weather was too lovely to justify classic all day. I COULD HAVE HAD BOTH!
---
Forsaken only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting
---
I would trade my own grandmother for 3 mages. Hero class I tell ya.
---
I'm personally of the opinion that they are two different games, and while i am having much more fun in classic right now, I dont want retail to try to be classic, I want retail to be the game with lots of mechanics (player mechanics, ie layering cooldowns, mechanically interesting rotations and fights) basically how class design was in legion (broken specs like demo aside) and let me feel powerful there, god dammit i have the claws of ursoc and pretty much every item significant to druids ever and you mean to tell me i cant fucking press frenzied regen because of the gcd?
---
There are no holy paladins or protection warriors until level cap.  You spec to level and it ain't a full healing or tank spec.
---
Could you just.. could you just not use "go back to Retail" as an attack? 
---
It feels like you're implying people you disagree with or who are just asshats in general (idk how layering works or how to abuse it so I can't tell why it's bad) only exist/belong on Retail.
---
Feel free to select World of Warcraft from the dropdown menu instead of World of Warcraft Classic. 
---
Lots of 'everybody gets a trophy' over there.
---
They did, that's why they kept adding servers. Still early for all of your friends to reroll on a server with 0 queues. Would benefit all of you
---
Sounds solid, I think I'll go for that, thank you
---
I say you pegged him rather quickly, +10 to intellect
---
If you played Vanilla on an NA server you probably called it VC.
---
The name dropped out of favor after TBC and beyond, which is why so many people now get confused saying they've always said DM.
---
Jesus, back to westfall with those straw mans. Wtf are you even on about at this point?
---
Yeah! Rogues have a lot of escape options. They definitely feel different from other classes. They have a lot of “flavor” to them. With their poisons and lockpicking
---
those 2 hours are what im looking forward to. I'm sure many guilds will be ready by then
---
No queue in Blaumeux and plenty other servers since day 3
---
But... why do I know exactly how long my gouge will stun a person.

Just joined to Ashenvale chat and people keep bashing BfA as if it's more interesting than their current quests.
---
Played 2h of retail earlier and haven't seen a single reminder of Classic.
---
I dont see how blizzard can stop layering by phase 2 with all these people that refuse to leave the over populated servers. At the very least it's going to he a shit show come phase 2 and the high pop servers crash with a thousand people in one spot.

Yeah it's quite annoying. Was stuck at a point where my hearth was already used a couple minutes ago but the marker said to use my hearth :(

There's a set of points in your Demonology tree that increases the effectiveness of your VW taunt. 2nd row I believe. It'll be one of the first set of points I get after Drain Soul buff. That should help.
---
Was solo clearing mobs to get a chest when this group pulls a million near me then steals it. 
---
So I tagged and killed named quest npc just up ahead.
---
Which I didn't even need.
---
Guy got pissed, I lol'd, cleared some more stuff and they were still waiting when I finished.
---
A chriswich, if you will
---
No player had to go out of their way? Ehhh I dont know how long you've been around, but 10 manning SM has never been a thing up to this point. And while managing the instance reset it quite literally specifies the limitations of a raid group. People went out of their way AND ignored warning signs.
---
Honestly, first time playing horde and I feel like ally might have a bit more of a sense of camaraderie. Horde seems to have more "loose cannon" "kirito solo player types" but that's just my experience so far. Also a lot of awesome dudes, got a full group to protect each other from ally gankers last night.
---
boomer post
---
nice fucking screenshots
---
Ok, so could you not defend something that you admittedly know absolutely nothing about?  That’d be great.
---
Can you clarify this being ban evasion given that r/wow and r/classicwow are not the same subreddit?
---
This should be upvoted to the top and pinned forever lol. If you want to speed run and AOE retail is sitting there waiting for you. DPS have more responsibility and utility than pew pew look at my damage. Be a good player not a chart watcher.
---
Chestfaming is a big problem. STV is a mess of it on just about every server or at least the three I play on.
---
I hear they're banning folks....now that apes took it to the extreme
---
Big, slow, hard hitting weapons for arms.
---
There are no class balance changes coming to classic. All classes use the final class design from vanilla.(1.12) So nothing to worry about.
---
It’s only relevant in capitals and lower zones that are not contested. In those you are not flagged but can turn on.
---
They can run back. That's an even bigger penalty.

Is there an Enemy Cast bar addon? 
---
What's a good threat add on?
---
Also, make sure you have the highest level spell on your bar. You have to do it manually. 
---
Also, it will pick up as time goes on. Most classes aren’t awesome the first little bit. Lots of face tanking and such.

Lock, 3 mages and a priest works miracles. Doing 30kxp/h in lib

That's a damn good map. I'm finding it surprisingly hard to search for things related to WoW classic/vanilla with google, mostly just been using wowhead.

Bookmarked!

Jesus fuck how many times do people with no sense of humor need to reply.  My comment is clearly satire.  People in this sub really need to lighten the fuck up.  Like seriously, how in the hell would this in any possible way be related to layer abuse?

Sempai after a magic trick went wrong :(
---
You can still do the farm with a 5 man group. It is actually more efficient that way. The 10 man way is just for people who are too bad at it.
---
It's almost like because becoming an adult has stripped away most of our opportunities for fun social interaction without a point or plan, they became much more meaningful when they do happen even if in game form.
---
Strange had the same issue and that fixed it for me. Sorry.
---
Guys like you, trying to tell people how to play are the worst.
---
of course there will be. classic ain't stopping at 1.12
---
Put at 5 points into spirit tap and wand spec and you can level as any spec from there
---
Hahahaha oh so very true
---
True, but if they mine once just for a skill point then leave they only stole three sec of your time =p  I admit that must be rare though
---
If they don't add more realms more ppl will move to those lower ppp realms.
---
Thanks, really wish they would give an ETA
---
I'd love an MMORPG designed for first person just for the experience (although it'd probably control terribly). I wonder how well a virtual keyboard would work in VR where you "tap* hotkeys displayed in game in front of you.
---
I paid someone 50s just so he would fuck off for a minute so i could finish my quest in that area.
---
Thanks for distracting the mob
---
Hell yeah
---
I had a warlock today in SM life-tapping to 10% health all the time and not drinking/eating after a pull. He even had the audacity of asking me for food/water when there wasn't a mage in the party.
---
I let him die a couple of times to see if he got the message. But not even then he would stop. People need to understand fully healing someone is a big chunk of our mana, which is better used on a tank or for less downtime.
---
I NEEDED to be a troll. And I didn't want to be mage because everyones a mage, and I didn't want to be a priest because I don't like the whole aspect of being a *priest*. So the only caster option left was shaman, and I love it.
---
&gt; we can get a long
---
It doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother me.
---
It bothers me a lot.
---
This used to happen to me so often in vanilla. I would do a little "prayer" hoping I would make it to my destination, instead of smack dab in the middle of the ocean. Good times!
---
I played for an hour today—no queues whatsoever. I’d just pick the right server. If you’ve got a friend group, that’s one thing, otherwise...? Pick something with lower pop.
---
I did 3 levels on emerald whelps for like the 9th time. Two hour levels on the dot 36-39. (Feral) still didn’t get one. Over 50 hours farmed across different servers
---
I had the dark oozeling on my old account.
---
That's why I went to a newer sever day one, no ques since then. People just want on the servers the "good" players were choosing.
---
I got a solid 20 min today...made it to 5 on my Lock. 
---
Slow and steady. At this pace I'll be 60 by the time WOTLK "Classic" comes out.
---
You can also use the snipping tool in windows 7/10 to capture a small part of the screen
---
This. But the main point is, dont be that person, but if you insist, make it known. Dont whine when an item drops and you suddenly try to dictate who gets it.
---
My opinion? Go to a different server so you don’t fight que times.
---
Sorry, was on a different layer and missed the joke.
---
Pure truth. I hope we'll all live in a safer, equal world in the near future. 
---
Thanks for the patience you used to explain why our sexual orientation sometimes needs to become such an important part of our identity.
---
If ya don't want to wait around in que (after all you should know about it) then go play retail.
---
Don't worry, normal dungeon runs I will rather take you than a mage.
---
took me 1 hour but i was so scared when i read it :D
---
I noticed today running dm that I'd heal the tank and his barely wouldn't move.  It's like he resisted the heal.  This happened many times both in and out of combat.  Maybe my ui was glitching?
---
I’ve had no issue just finding another node when someone gets to a node before me. Why can’t they just find another node?
---
if you want the life of a comedian, you have to learn to deal with hecklers. as of now, you sir, are no comedian.
---
I can confirm, because I am playing on EU servers while in North America.
---
also if tanks could stop YOLO pulling like they're in retail that'd be great.
---
I literally did this same 300iq move earlier
---
Is paladin tank leveling viable? if not , what class do you recommend for lvling as a tank -ish?
---
Had this same experience in WC last night.  The priest healer was dot pulling groups and the mage was firing bolts at mobs before I could LOS.  The healer was level 22 and way OP for the dungeon or it would have been a disaster.  They all thought I was crazy of course for telling them they were doing it all wrong.  I should have left the group.  No more pugs for me.
---
I loled at "an honorable death" he expected getting baited from the start and still participated
---
Paladin can judge seal of righteousness (basically the most common leveling seal) for decent damage at a 15 yard range-  about half of a typical 'max range' spell like frostbolt or lightning bolt.
---
I never asked for anyone to bring high level characters to breeze through quests. I wouldn't want that anyways. But no one is willing to play at all, whether it be with a high level character, a low level character, or even people working on the same quest. To say there are still questing groups to be at low levels is just wrong, and is misleading new players. The boat was gone after the first few days. It is absolutely far too late.
---
Someone just did this to me today. True lowlifes.
---
I can't imagine taking the time out of my day to type this sad shit up. How has this managed to not get removed..
---
&gt; if you didn't go out of your way to grab the Theramore fight path
---
Isn't it way easier to get to ratchet from theramore than astranaar? My warrior friend had to go to the fight club island so we just took the boat from menthil and swam up the coast of dustwallow marsh to the barrens, did his quest and got the ratchet FP.
---
I didn't fancy going south into Barrens since I figured one of the 10-20's would get his main or call for assistance before I'd made it safely to rachet
---
So people still have to go to Warcraft as a whole on the launcher, reinforce that classic isn't its own product, the sub pay for retial AND classic
---
It has nothing to do with queue times. The engine is really old and the network management is different than last time because the demand is much higher due to more concurrent players. All these people salty about not being able to login during the first weeks must grow the fuck up including you who definitely doesn't know what the fuck you are talking about lmao. Im not defending blizzard since i think they made really poor business decisions on the routes they want to take on game design. But the polish and maintenence was never a complaint. Just because classic is popular and you like it, you shouldnt be self entitled and shit on the solutions they have just because some people use them for exploits.
---
TL;dr: Grow The Fuck Up
---
Or pinch escort quests while you're clearing eg. Mist on Teldrassil
---
One of the reasons I didn't go mage. I knew mage and hunter will be the most taken classes.
---
I got killed by a group if alliance camping the bottom of the elevators at thousand needles. I was pissed, but also couldn't stop laughing so fair play.
---
The guides have the mentality that gold \*exists\* and it is easy to sell things on the AH.  They don't account for the fact that even a purple BoE sells for 30g tops right now.
---
Items/materials are easy to farm.  Raw gold is not.  All the gold farming guides rely on liquid gold being present in the market.  Not over half of us still needing a bloody mount.
---
Once a week for fall ball since the city gave the fields to the youth leagues on Friday nights.
---
If they could pay BEFORE the res, people would make a bit of cash doing this I bet.
---
Any advice for a resto druid? 
---
Also any useful macros? I've been playing since lich and I've never used macros or addons but I'm thinking maybe i should try.
---
How the hell can you be named GAYchris but I can’t be Eggplant??
---
I guess it would make the grind super pleasurable in comparison to music like this
---
I know its fashionable to hate Blizz for how its been handled but I honestly believe trying to have as few servers as possible has been the correct move. Absolutely nobody expects to see Classic stay this populated long term. And we all understand how community affects the game. I get the logic in wanting to ensure you have stable communities and servers 100%. If they went overboard on servers and the game ultimately balances out with 3-4 servers or whatever, it'd be a big "fuck you blizzard, how are you fixing this." It's really damned if they do, damned if they don't.
---
More likely he was deleting it and accidentally clicked you. I like the concept of passing the banana on though.
---
You mean when he gave the horde to garrosh and said do what you want with it then cheated at Mak’gora against him and told the horde they are on their own...
---
It's not even just that you're a frost mage.  It's you have the sheep ability.  When I look for dps I just /who mage specifically because sheep is the best cc.
---
Give me numbers please.. Blizzard, I want to see how wrong you are on how to build an MMORPG.
---
We hit our head on everything. Can’t fit in some airline seats. Roller coaster shoulder restraints don’t go all the way down.
---
People falling for the bait, smh guys.
---
And here we have a classic example of why people missed vanilla WoW.  If you want to play a solo game, there already is one.
---
Lol i am being downvoted for this well ok 😄 but anyway i guess its a preference thing i just quickly went into search and  checked few all easy to see no "squinting"  ofc its easier to see details in proper screenshot noone was saying anything about it.. the point is the struggle you describing is not really there and specialy for me  on a phone but hey it would he nice if everyone was using print screen i agree.
---
Very carefully!
---
Discovering around Durotar areas give around 9-15xp per region, so we could nibble it down. We were 5xp and 7xp away when we rode into town. 
---
I think it was even more fun riding through Orgrimmar lol
---
This! I see this all the time, even in my guild. People constantly shitting on retail. It's getting really boring and even annoying.
---
They also whine about the free 110/free BfA promotion. If the whining about retail wasn't shitty enough, it's beyond entitled to whine about free shit that you get by playing something you'd play anyway.
---
&gt;he is tainting the experience 
---
Literally what is wrong with you guys
---
Your memory is bad then. 400k is maybe in BC. I remember 71-72 being around 1.5 million.
---
That’s when I vanish to deaggro and camp you until I get bored. Unless you’re Horde... then I post this.
---
I think people really still have a retail mentality that the end game is where the party is. They'll be in for a shock when MC/Ony aren't enough to hold their attention with PVP and future raids still months away.
---
Nah man TB is the best, everything but class trainers are all smooshed into the central mesa and it makes everything so easy. Everything is equidistant from the flight master. Bank and AH are 10 feet from each other. So great.
---
Lucky you ;)
---
but it does feel good, remember getting stonetalon blueprints first mobs.
---
Neatplates has enemy cast bars. It'll also change the color of the name plates based on whether or not you have threat.
---
Really? Tons called it DM before Dire Maul was a thing.
---
Same issue on the same server!!! I tried to log in at 2p MST and have been in queue ever since now 645p...
---
Started at 2270 went up to 4700 and slowly coming down finally four hours later. Brother in law was on, idled out 45 minutes later rejoined and dropped in at 1000 in queue and is back in already.
---
Some definite prioritization or whitelisting going on
---
Yeah, Prat has been great for me, although it has been dropping my frames randomly and need to restart/reload from time to time.
---
Some items are fairly good and get bought. Especially if you find warlock/paladin gear since they don't really need to save for mount.
---
I laughed, don't worry
---
Just made a character on netherwind this morning I had low pop when I make characters now it's got medium pop. 
---
newer servers going to have a more fair and economy but considering the oldest server is like 6 days old most of the economy starts in stone inside for maybe a few of the servers with all the method players are all the world firsts on it.
---
They are probably able to live reload values taken from their database. It works the same with emulated servers
---
Because they want to.
---
It took me over an hour of farming those fuck head spiders this morning to get it. You know how many spiders that is to take over an hour? 😤👿
---
That witch has no life.
---
and yet continued to take name reservations on those full servers right up to and after launch, and yet also removed the 3 name max character limit before launch which could have done nothing but make a bad situation worse. They didn't add new servers until, I can't remember exactly when, but the day before of the day of launch and even then only 4 servers which in very short order also filled up. So they added more and then they filled up. So a bunch of people have moved and then got stuck in queues on those servers as well. 
---
Sure they have added even more servers since then and it seem there are servers without queue times now but at this point most people that have been playing have progressed to a point where they don't want to change and lose all of their progress
---
I don't know why that's so hard to understand for people
---
I would expect some sort of transfer service off the big servers to specific smaller/newer servers to be coming sooner rather than later. It'd be interesting to see how many people actually take advantage of it(my gut says very few people actually take a free transfer).
---
Damn you baited everybody, well played.
---
I'm on thalnos seems fine to me. I spent most of the afternoon partying on STV killing horde and doing quests
---
Lmao you're a disgusting little fanboy. Kill yourself. "The network can't handle it" LMFAO.
---
What is wrong with you people that you don't understand that in a massive multiplayer online rpg the actions of others affect the whole world you are playing on and also change the way all people play the game? People don't exist in a vacuum.
---
 The people who got to lv60 first get complete control over rare resources like Devilsaur, Ghost Mushrooms and such. Plus farming things like rare recipes or items (eg Crusader, Tidal Charm etc) without competition. 
---
Handy for Whipper Root Tuber and Nightblossom farming too, since no competition.
---
"but the end result is the same, it saves time".
---
There are A LOT of methods that save time. It doesn't matter if the end result is the same, if one player is using a bug that gives extra xp and another is gaining that same extra xp through layering, then I'm pretty sure people will care about the guy bug abusing than the guy using layering to "save time"
---
can't imagine being this pathetically obsessed with someone else's life
---
ah, okay! thanks for the info. :)
---
HoTs and just let them die first.
---
Yea seriously, have people not played Witcher or Horizon Zero Dawn?  And that's on inferior console hardware.
---
I run chill dungeons the old way.  Some people hate it and I boot them.  I have no interest in retail or its zerg mode bum rush playstyle.  I do strat for every pull.  It's what I like, it's how we did it in 05 and it's less risky.  The point is run things the way you want.
---
Yeah mine was about 11am so it was almost prime time (given what today is most people are off school etc)
---
*laughs in westcoast medium pop*
---
It's definitely the time to buy twink items.
---
That kinda fits
---
I’m not 18, if I was I would be playing rn, I am trying to get a debit card atm tho
---
is mak gor alike tiral by combat
---
So the tensions just keep escalating ever more. That does sum it up nicely. What is MOP?
---
You should and you'll see at high level in raids overhealing will get you oom pretty fast. It's not as much of a problem in 1.12 compared to early vanilla but still, you will need to start a cast and stop if the tank doesn't take damage for example in order to profit from the 5 second rule ect.
---
Kiting shit to goldshire, [as is tradition](https://i.imgur.com/Lj6liog.jpg). (screenie from a decade or so ago, lol)
---
I hope some people there experienced the confusion for the first time. Lowbie "raid bosses" are amazing fun.
---
what low pop? my server list has all full aside from 3 mediums. and i hear all of them have que times aswell
---
I wish I was small brain enough to enjoy slowly leveling in wow and watching big bang theory  but I just can't do that to myself.
---
Any ideas on how to get around the 10gb limit? My phone has always been able to tether or hotspot but I just got a new plan from my grandfathered one.  Says I have a hotspot bucket.  
---
I dont really wanna have to root my phone to use what I already pay for, but I'll do what I gotta do.  Need me some barrels chat .
---
It's possible that they used their horn at the same time as you.
---
This happened to me, I used my horn and unbeknownst to me another guy did too, so I killed the mob and then this guy starts abusing me for something that wasn't intentional
---
3s saved is 3s earned
---
I was giving away free enchants (felt  better than enchanting the same piece of gear over and over again)  and making bags for use of their mats. People ended up giving me silvers! I was a happy boi
---
Nice.
---
Interrupt fear and kill the warlock?
---
Same here. Luckily I'm off Friday so only a three day work week.
---
the sub button is in the classic client
---
Moo.
---
Quite impressive how the the good people of Goldshire were able to put away their gay sex role-playing long enough to come together and kill him.  What a community!
---
It does prevent the warrior from generating rage as they also generate rage when they take dmg/get hit. 
---
So generally, it's not ideal to shield tanks since they need the rage to gain aggro. Shields should be casted on in emergency situations to save the tank from dying. Mostly cast the shields on not rage dependent cahrs such as casters, other melee dps etc.
---
I was just adding to the discussion and agreeing with you.
---
BLUZZARD WE ARE RUNNING LOW ON KARMA FARM POSTS FIX THIS NON ISSUE NOW!
---
It depends sometimes the chest are so crap nobody cares. Same with the greens that drop in dungeons and the whole need/greed roll. If you need it need roll etc.
---
That may be true, but I wont be raiding, so it wont be an issue for me
---
Which begs the question - why are you playing the game if you don't enjoy actually playing it? Once you reach end game everything comes to a grinding halt because fresh content dries up quickly. You could say the leveling experience is boring because you've done it multiple times. But if you're the average Warcraft player you've done dungeons multiple times, raids multiple times, grinding gear multiple times etc. The formula never changes. You're always doing something you've done before. You've just chosen to prioritize where your repetition occurs.  The only thing that rushing content assures is that most players will tire of Warcraft more quickly and move on to other games. Warcraft isn't an esport. You're not competing with anyone unless you're in a guild like Method. And so the impetus to reach max level as quickly as one can means nothing. No one else cares how long it took but you. If it makes you feel good inside to have a self-imposed race to the top, so be it. But that doesn't make the psychology or philosophy of the action a good or sound one. I say that as someone who would have said exactly what you have 11 years ago. Life is short. Spend time doing what you love.
---
Yep! That’s what makes this helm so awesome. Power shifting for extra damage
---
I'm pretty sure that is the case. Issues with centaurs are a huge part of the Tauren history and I believe one of the main reasons they joined the Horde.
---
I am sure the centaurs would not be Keen to try to ride up a platform so it is exceptionally safe.
---
Well I can’t prove that. But even still, he didn’t even say “sorry” after I /shout HEY YOU STOLE MY KILL
---
30 years old with a kid and full time job, yep.
---
Stayed up till 2:30am for the first time in probably 4 years last night playing WoW.
---
As another commenter mentioned, I'm loving all the small things now. Before it was just power leveling and raiding to death, now I'm taking time to read the lore, admire scenes, ambient sounds, and the music. I love interacting with people. If I find a green or better item I will find someone around me that can use it and give it to them for free, or go around healing and buffing people for fun. I'm loving it. It's really slow, and I'm not sure how much time I can dedicate but when I do get a nice little binge session it is so much fun.
---
What shit.
---
He asked politely for an alternative.
---
Do you think a tank is going to tell you to pay them when they are helping friends in DM when you get a whisper from a raid leader saying they need an off-tank for a guaranteed Onyxia kill?
---
Get real.
---
Man I'd kill for a 1 hour queue
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
That would be amazing
---
It hurts.
---
Yep. Magic, unless either both are capable of wielding or is previously agreed upon, is not allowed. There's a whole set of rules to a Mok'gora you can look up but Thrall either cheated or gave himself a staggeringly unfair advantage
---
the presence of something isn't an argument against more of it
---
Right now im on fairbanks level 50 and i want to transfer to stalag or indus or whatever the server names are.
---
Even our military uses the sane, day month year system, and kph (at least on base in Iraq).
---
Can't. Level 45 on Whitemane and our guild is there. Hard to move 60 plus people
---
This is something I am really interested in as a first time player running healer. Do you recommend any addons that are similar or the same as the in game UI?
---
you 100% planned that
---
No. They don't. I'm on Azuresong and I've never had a queue, even just a little bit ago, logging in at peak times
---
I agree, it's lazy.
---
just use VNC.....
---
Was working towards a chest the other night - watched a lock trying to go to it get chased off by 3-4 harpies and die. As I'm killing the last one I see him run to up loot it. I say "You're welcome!" and what do I get back? "Who do you think cleared the others idiot?"
---
Hmmm...tough one there.
---
1 of the 5 times i was dc from que it gave me my spot back.
---
"Do I really neeeeed this spell right now? I'm not even that spec so Ill get it later... Oh shit I can't afford main spec spells either... Oh. Oh no."
---
[Necrosis](https://willitclassic.com/view/FqwDs4b1G1p0ZWQjPlXG)

Imo Tauren, Orcs and Trolls are just trying to live their life and make the best out of it. There are some who are more warmongering out of them, but most are good guys. The blood elves don't really come up often in the story iirc. But the Forsaken just drag the entire Horde down doing brutal and disgusting shit all the time. Sylvanas becoming the War Chief was the worst thing that could happen to the Horde.
---
It's not. Search r/relationship_advice and WoW, grab some popcorn and read up
---
shhh
---
*pirates of the Caribbean theme song plays*
---
Thanks. TIL. No wonder my healer wasn’t too happy when he found out I was Life Tapping XD
---
I see no arguments or anything to stand on  besides "kys". You're a true schollar congratulations. Once again you have proven to have 0 knowledge on the subject to speak about it
---
Eventually, you‘re gonna run out of mana.
---
Very accurate
---
That ret paladins are a meme and should never be taken seriously
---
There is a reason Arcanite Reaper is so coveted by warriors end game.
---
Someone is probably logging on with your account and booting you out. Change your password and register your phone as an authenticator.
---
Jeez.
---
I underestimated how much people have min maxxed Classic. How do they play for 10 years and not get bored?
---
I mindlessly do quests but enjoy it still. I’m not in a rush to get to 60 but I’ve leveled enough of private vanilla servers to have already experienced the “vanilla experience”
---
I'm sure it's for both parts, but it's ok, people hate the truth.
---
&gt; Any advice for a resto druid?
---
??? care to be more specific?
---
&gt;Also any useful macros? 
---
[here](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=druid+classic+macros)
---
I swear I tried doing this 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
For every age player that wants to level fishing to 225 there’s one rushing to 60. 
---
Was much the same on vanilla.
---
If you have less than 1 hour total commute and don't have children / demanding partner, you can easily work 9 hours a day and have decent amount of time to play now and then.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Just like you want to play your game the way you do, you should respect others for playing how they want to play. 
---
Also quite hypocritical to put someone down for telling someone else how to play *by telling him how to play*.
---
Man I can't wait for character transfers. You think they will do it? This early?
---
Advanced Interface Options has something for that iirc
---
There's no argument to be made because you're an incompetent fanboy. You think their arrogance when it came to player queues and server requirements was a result from an incapable network, you're incompetent and naive.
---
Kill yourself, fanboy.

---
True... They think endgame is where it is at. 
---
It's really sad though, I've grouped up with people who have only ever played retail, really enjoying classic, only to be fucked over/ignored by some elitist retail asshole chasing world first or chain tagging mobs instead of simply inviting us to a party.
---
Unless you are purchasing something from the auction house on buyout. Not sure about bids.
---
I no lifed Classic this past week while on vaca. My /played is something stupid like 4 days 3 hours and Im only 38. But, my tailoring is super high and I have lvl 40 blues I crafted waiting for me, tons of gold from bags, tons of memories from dungeons and new friends. 
---
Classic has been everything I thought it would be.
---
Cope
---
Still in queue
---
Thanks bro. It's like people think moving servers is always so simple
---
I'm 22 with a 38 hour work week, my only responsibility is my girlfriend, still only manage to get 20ish hours a week in hahaha :/

It is known.

&lt;Final Flame&gt; [Deviate Delight] 🔥
---
Who we are:
---
Final Flame is a casual PVE/PVP/RP guild that is made up of core raiders from our retail guild, as well as new members. Our core members love WoW, love Classic, are skilled and knowledgeable, and especially love helping guildies in order to build a lasting guild home. We will be raiding in the future and tackling all content, but are really enjoying the journey of leveling in Classic right now.
---
Who we welcome:
---
Anyone seeking a fun, helpful and passionate guild that they can call home. Whether you are seeking to destroy the most difficult of raids, or would just like to chat and pick flowers - you will fit right in.
---
Raiding:
---
We will have a weekly raiding schedule once our guild has a solid number of max level raiders, but the schedule is TBD for now.
---
Loot:
---
No formal rules until we begin raiding.
---
We are not a guild that is going to spam chat looking for any and all players to join. We are not a guild that uses an obnoxious name that you will hate in a month. We are not a guild that is rushing to endgame in a cutthroat manner. We are not a guild that will tolerate selfish players who do not have any interest in supporting their guildies, or treat them poorly.
---
We ARE a guild that just wants to enjoy Classic to the fullest - no drama.
---
Come join our family!

The top players and guilds always abuse some sort of mechanic in game. That's how they stay ahead. As long as something is not strictly against the tos it's better for those people to tread in grey area and leverage what you can and risk getting slapped on the wrist a couple times than not do it. If it wasn't layering it would be something else, every worlds best guild does it.
---
is that 30 min after your last action, or 30 min after your character sits down and goes &lt;afk&gt;?
---
My hunter characters range DPS is far better than melee. When I fight mobs currently, I send my pet then attack from range. Often though the mob will aggro me. 
---
I've noticed that cower exists and I've started using that which seems to make a difference. Are there any other common methods people use to keep distance from targets?
---
The comment was about invading land though. Not about who opened the portal. And let's be real, Sargeras opened the portal, Medivh was just the vessal/puppet.
---
Ah that does help a lot, thank you!
---
It works with Shadowed Unit Frames.
---
That just made me realize how much flavor the classes lost. I liked a lot of the changes to the game over time, but seeing Shaman Totems again reminded me how much I loved that. There are some definitive problems with classes (and professions) in Vanilla/Classic, but I so wish for an alternate timeline in which those were addressed rather than removed.
---
You on kirtonos?
---
It’s high now
---
Try mouse 4 and mouse 5. Frees up q and e for more accessible binds.
---
why are you this way
---
i will never understand that, sadly you can see that in every platform, social network, etc.
---
Priest IMHO is a support role.... so you should buddy up with a warrior, stand back and throw out heals et al . So long as you are grouped you will earn XP without playing an offense role.
---
There will be a whole bunch more experienced players around that can provide you a more detailed playbook for you.
---
I have the feeling that I will love the comments of this post... 
---
My notepad is ready.

That's what he is saying
---
They practiced for this for years, they got all the sitting experience
---
Everyone, get in here!
---
Thanks, it's very possible I will sign up early and check things out so I'll keep that in mind :)
---
Do you happen to know the maximum population on the severs currently? I haven't been able to figure that out yet. Because my understanding is they're estimating that around 80% or so of the people there at launch will be gone by phase two. So my bet is that this estimate is pretty far off the mark, and they'll be forced to open more at that point because the max is supposed to be reduced to 4-5k. Or perhaps they'll just keep layering longer than they promised, but I really hope not.
---
exactly lol
---
What does Khadgar have to do with it?
---
No problem! After spending your first 10 points life gets easier. Do 5/5 Wand damage and 5/5 Spirit tap (gives you a lot of mana regen after each kill so you have little downtime between mobs).

you are more pro than asmongold

If anything, Horde are the bad guys... I have been attacked by all levels of horde players, even if I help them kill a mob or something. I'm pretty passive, but if your lvl 22 ass is going to try and attack me, I'm not going to sit there and die. For the Alliance!
---
Yea I've always alternated between friendly but also a dick in a joking way. Like i steal chests and shit moonfire spam mobs lol. But I throw out heals and if people talk to me or invite I will always help and join etc. People need to realize it's a game and have a bit of fun lol. Obviously I'm not stealing shit on dungeons etc.

He’ll be back in 2 minutes
---
Someone wanna translate CoD for us rookies
---
The grind isn’t really all that fun. It has its moments from time to time. I, personally, don’t have any fond memories of the grind to 60 in classic or private servers.
---
All of my “FUCK YA!” freeze frame moments happened in raids and bgs at level cap. 
---
Don’t hate on the players that know what they want. There is no consequence to you.
---
The busy times begin! Congratulations! It’s worth it.

It's not that people don't know how to take a screenshot on their desktop. It's that they're using the mobile app to upload and it's easier to just take a picture and upload through the app. You'd be surprised how many people don't even use the desktop website.
---
I wish they did it sooner rather than later. These queues are a joke. Literally paying for their game and cant play it.
---
Are the old glitches still there?

Cool idea. A second monitor is better

I definitely meant coins.

I'm looking for a guild who plans on running dungeons and raiding together.  Id like a guild who raids twice a week starting around 930-1030 server time. I'm a dedicated player who is looking to play classic long term. 
---
I'm interested in warrior/resto druid/mage/Hunter.  I would like to main warrior if guild does not need the others I mentioned.  
---
Really just want to make some connections and have fun. I'm laid back and expect very little asides we do content.

I’d like a window seat please.

7$ a gold?! Holy shit that’s a scam

You shouldn’t play online games if they make you feel like this.
---
Your dad is still milking the cow. Dont worry hell be back.
---
Honestly, I also feared classic wouldn't be as good as I remember it when I played back in BC (which was basically classic from a leveling perspective). And I have to say, it isn't as classic was, it is so much better. Back then I was a little 10 years old boy who didn't understand how games work. I played a fucking balance druid during leveling, always had trouble finding groups for stuff and my computer crashed constantly. Now I understand how to play, which makes for a still hard but smooth experience. I also have a good computer and there are people everywhere and everyone is happy to be playing classic. 
---
I ran a dungeon today, WC, it was exactly as I remember playing WoW. We got lost in the dungeon, our tank was massively underleveled, most people didn't really understand how their class works and we just tried to get through.
---
This is why I don’t share screenshots. I refuse to take a picture with my phone but also exclusively Reddit on mobile.
---
Exactly what I was thinking!
---
Fair enough answer. Don't think you got what I was getting at... why? if someone has achieved world first, why get to 60 so fast? it seems really wasteful of such an experience that so many people have waited for, only to go "LFG AoE farm".
---
How many /played did this screenshot take?

No, he got money from his subscribers and people watching, not from blizzard. That literally objectively means it's not "prize money".

He earned it by earning donations through his stream. Or do you not understand how twitch works??
---
Not that a Chromebook wouldn't have the processing power... it doesn't have the OS. You can't install WoW on one because WoW doesn't support ChromeOS.

There wont be any patch changes.  There will be phases of new raids released but no balance changes

They spawn all at once.  If you only get one or two taps it's probably because someone else already tapped it before.

One night, because our tanks were busy with other groups, a group of us in our guild ran a comp of Rogue/Rogue/Mage/Mage/Priest (I'm the Priest). Was actually a ton of fun, and worked quite well. The Rogues just handled the caster mobs, and the Mages took care of the melee mobs. In PUGs I'd stick with normal comps, but if you have a group of experienced players you can try all sorts of interesting combinations in Classic.
---
The best advice for a dps paladin is to roll holy instead. :P
---
Just wait for thunder clap/demo shout debuffs from war tanks before you attack and then focus whatever target the war is stacking Saunders on.
---
We should get emotes atleast
---
Everyone had access to the same tools on release. If blizzard released it, its apart of the game. You can suck blizzards dicks and call it an exploit, but everyone knew what was possible with layering, including blizzard, before launch and Apes used it as one of their tools.
---
Its blizzard's fault for going down the path of layering in the first place. It didn't end up solving the problem they intended to solve, queue times, and now were stuck with both problems.

---
Heck yeah - it was the most classic moment I have yet for sure! :)
---
Lots of us played on private servers, I've already leveled so many times I just want to get back into raiding.
---
As a priest, I like having a Palatank in my group. I can pre-bubble them and I get blessings. So I'd say go for it.
---
Oh 100%.. it’s so dumb... I watch entertainment for entertainment not for drama or what they do.
---
Laundry and children are not exactly the same level of humble haha. But I feel you
---
&gt; With these queues I don't wanna mess with stuff for too long when I finally manage to log in!
---
In general, you can pop-off and log right back in, even when the server is full.  Just do it in under a minute (i.e. already have addons installed).
---
Until 35 or 40 it doesn't really matter what you build. Either wear some +heal or put on a beefy shield and go to town.
---
Ban them for bug abuse. Easy.
---
Agreed this is everything you need as a warlock.
---
You can keybind marks in the regular keybinding menu in the game. That's generally enough to mark up groups quickly (I have common marks bound from F1-F5, but use whatever is comfortable for you).
---
Stance dancing as a tanking warrior is mainly used for the utility skills you can't use in Defensive Stance. Generally you'll only switch stance for as long as it takes to use the ability you need, then switch back immediately, so you'll either want to learn to hit these keybinds in quick succession or make handy macros.
---
Some examples:
---
Starting a fight in Battle Stance and charging into mobs to get a little initial rage.
---
Switching to Battle Stance when your taunt is on cooldown and using Mocking Blow to keep a mob on you.
---
Switching to Berserker Stance and using Intercept on a mob that's running away or going for your healer.
---
Switching to Berserker Stance and using Pummel to interrupt a mob casting a spell.
---
Switching to Berserker Stance and using Berserker Rage to negate fear.
---
Remember that by default switching stances will drain your rage. The Tactical Mastery talent in the Arms tree can help you retain more rage when you're stance dancing a lot.
---
Hey dude - it took me a while to find my old Reddit account! Usually just scroll through Reddit and never comment on anything but just wanted to say this was so awesome and so wholesome. Made me smile seeing this blow up randomly haha. Also, to anyone that is concerned my name about my name being reported shouldn’t be worried. I’ve been known in the PvP community on retail within Tichondrius since Cata and used to play with the hey im mvp crew. I’ve gone to many Blizzcon’s and have been known as Gaychris forever! [gamer tag proof here ](https://imgur.com/gallery/eY3o6mB) hope everyone is enjoying their classic experience as much as I am.
---
Doesn't everyone? It was used with a modifier key before.
---
Exploiting a dungeon-raid bug for xp
---
Technically you get Classic for free by paying a monthly sub in retail. So it belongs where it is - it's a free game tacked onto retail wow.
---
/u/Metacane I just released version 0.2 ! you should try it out
---
I was following a hunter around and helping her kill whelps today while I skinned them.  After about an hour or so, she opens trade with me and gives me one, says that it's the second one she's got.
---
Thank you kind stranger!
---
Just get teamviewer on your pc and phone and login 2-3 hours before your supposed to be home... I haven’t waited in queue since release
---
Well apparently I'm doing something right!!
---
What is the MCP?
---
Nope. He was dumb. But you're probably bad too.
---
Like this?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/StormyAbnegateOtterResidentSleeper
---
Or are you talking about when you stand there for ages before a shot goes off.
---
That sounds good I'll try that rotation too, thanks!
---
Yeah exactly
---
Dumb question as a 19 resto druid. What stats should I be prioritizing?
---
Yup. I would have sworn that auto dismount was a thing in vanilla, now I've got 50 macros just to do anything without having to hit an extra button first.
---
Do you think the 100,000 people unable due to blizzard's f' up will be part of the group who stops playing?
---
Sadly yes, kurinaxx. Hillsbrad has been hell trying to aoe farm.
---
That is awesome. I am going to do it.
---
Back just before the realise of BC I did it simply playing the mage with priest on follow on second screen and tabbing between them. Annoying for looting quest items but other than that was a breeze.
---
Horde and Skeram. I know I'm not the original person to comment. Level 21 Undead and really want to try AOE leveling
---
Pretty sure its confirmed to have paided transfers in 1-2 months going by what some1 has told me, but that info could be wrong
---
Oh wow the more you know
---
Quick joke:
---
What do you call an entitled, privileged white woman? “Karen”
---
What do you call an entitled, privileged white man?
---
Oh, never mind, they don’t get a dismissive nickname. They’re just in charge of everything.
---
Betting it was Shadowed Unit Frames. Been using that and Dominoes for a decade+ and have tried the others both big and small.
---
It can be worthwhile to have someone like a mage do a big cast (like pyro) followed by an immediate charge taunt by the war for some easy initial threat on a single target. The same applies for paladins in an aoe pull with the “pull all the mobs on x player” buff/taunt thing they have but I’m not sure if that’s in vanilla.
---
10-man dungeons ok (as it was in vanilla), full xp for raids not ok.
---
This works beautifully
---
Gays do it all the time
---
The drop rates are way higher than I remember, or layering is causing something fucky with drop rates
---
I think I was on around 20g by the late level 20s. After you get level 31 or so the gold starts coming in quick though.
---
I'm at 50g on level 35 now
---
That's almost worse than being murdered. Jesus, you must live in constant fear.
---
I remember using Feign Death to manage aggro way back when.
---
Pretty sure Fairbanks is #2 for pop judging by queues
---
So we're the servers at the time..shit happens
---
AOE grinding like a good boy.
---
Lol! The app claims to be a 12 year mmorpg that is returning. It looks quite literally like every other shitty mobile game... false advertising, great looking graphics, but showing absolutely no real gameplay. I can't believe this stuff is even allowed.
---
There is... oh god I can't remember, one of those dragon elites, in Tanaris. You can kite back to Org.
---
While you're right, the gold he'll make from vendoring skins won't be enough to pay for skilling engineering 0-300 later, so imo he might aswell keep it
---
How often do you need to hit them ive had mobs reset second after hitting them
---
I want to get 60 as fast as possible.
---
As a warrior my spells don't do shit anyway. 90% of my time is spent auto attacking because I have no rage. I'm pretty sure I'm only going to rank up my tank spells from now on for the threat. The others seem worthless.
---
Objectively, it’s low poly (not ugly). Ugliness is subjective by definition. However, clever use of texturing has helped. Texturing has improved significantly over the years.
---
That being said, i’d love to make a UE4 WoW experience. I was working on a UE4 Pokémon experience until I realized Nintendo would likely send a S&amp;D.
---
You can heal most of the leveling dungeons in a DPS spec lol
---
I'm honestly surprised they didn't in the first place.
---
Ahh i wish my friends were into wow. Poor bastards only play Apex/Fornite...
---
Glad you guys had fun:)
---
You just bank the mats from mining....
---
I’ve been out of the retail game for a few years now, but there’s was definitely stupid upset customer agro in my experience.
---
Wow-head classic has an aoe mage guide. And there is a YouTube video by kargoz that I found useful.
---
I managed to play 2 days and 20 hours with a 59 hours job. 
---
Yes I’m tired ....
---
Same! Love seeing others making this a goal
---
I was questing through the undead starting areas where you are trying out new plague samples on alliance prisoners and just thinking 'are we the baddies?'.
---
It's great how they had some of these long running quest lines pay off eventually
---
Underlevelled tanks make runs outright unfun. "Wait for me to get aggro!" They say as they miss the trash mobs 6 times in a row.
---
"What do we do now?" "Now we can finally play the game"
---
hope this never gets patched just fur the lulz I don't play wow
---
O no I hate phone pictures especially mine. IPhone 6s camera and a 5 year old basic ass 32” tv don’t lend themselves to nice pictures. If it’s really worth it I’ll SD&gt;email&gt;download&gt;post
---
Understood thanks for the explanation
---
Am I alone in thinking OP is the shitbag here? Spending that much time getting postage back is dumb, but you wasted his time on selling the item. Why taunt him over that?
---
No he isn't.  He is claiming that using the life stealing skills are low dps and the healer should be able to toss a big heal on the lock every other fight to make up for life tapping.
---
Its just a time waster while you wait for a mob to spawn or dungeon/raid to start. Nothing but killing time while you wait in the area
---
And then the boat vanishes from under you and you are dropped into the water and forced to swim back while the next round comes and goes.
---
What if a warrior came away with 4 blues already and everyone was congratulating him, and then a leather agi piece drops and he out rolls the rogue and hunter (who didn't get anything over 2 runs)? Just happened.
---
I too had enough gold at 40. With honoured rep for your faction it's less than 100 gold. The most important thing is not wasting gold, do not buy all your abilities, only those crucial to your characters leveling. Then vendoring leather, selling greens, questing, farming and dungeon runs is all I did. Nothing specific really it just happens if you are frugal. Already have had 100 gold again since and spent most of it catching up on my abilities lol.
---
u see how psychologically impactful classic being in a drop box to retail is! u get it m8, thank u! finally a comment with a human behind it! i can get back to wow with faith restored
---
They respawn but not as fast as when they are cleared.
---
Kudos!  Very Rosa parks of you!!!!
---
Might actually be better than some of my guildmates :D does he need a guild?
---
Does this go higher than the max settings in the options menu?
---
We played that dumb Live To Win song on repeat.
---
&gt; and I hate levelling in retail 
---
I gotta be fair here: leveling in BFA was a great experience. Amazing worldbuilding, great-looking maps, interesting quest chains, everything. I'm actually thinking now about making a new character just for that. 
---
Once at max level the experience was complete trash
---
I'll second Neat Plates (similar to Tidy Plate Threat Plates on retail).  There's also a vanilla UI option to "overlap or stack" nameplates.
---
VuhDo for tracking who you have PW:S, Renew, etc. on.  Also good for casting the proper dispel.  VuhDo also tells you who has aggro (is about to take a hit).
---
&gt; using one rank too high of a heal sometimes because I am expecting more damage to go to the tank then actually does
---
You can either downrank or just cancel the cast after the first 25% by moving foward/back slightly.  Then immediately start the cast again.  That way, if they do take massive spike in damage, you just let the already started cast land.
---
Yeah. That’s why it was “10man cleave SM” constantly. It was a bug that was being exploited, on a huge scale, and it allowed for an enormous amount of players to level-up WAY faster than they otherwise should have been able to.
---
what could a banana cost, $10?
---
And  a banana.
---
Half as hard as you should have
---
But think about it this way, say the maximum is 25k right now. If a server has no queues right now, it might still have 20k at peek hours. And if that number doesn't drop a huge amount in the coming weeks like Blizz suspects, even your server could have a pretty huge queue when they turn off layering, much less the servers that still have big queues right now.
---
In any case, I think my plan's worth a shot, thanks though! :)
---
Damn bro you’re gonna have to pay at least 30 silver
---
That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen
---
Depends when you want to log in. Higher pop servers will have a queue for weeks to come during peak times. I've been logging in just fine on Stalagg at 9-11am. Starting at noon the queue hits 5-9k.
---
If you end up on Hetod Horde pm me. Will gladly help;) As for guides just go to YouTube. Everything you need is there.
---
This is awesome! Good job y’all
---
Sorry, I don’t like it.
---
I was expecting the stilized cartoony houses, but in higher quality - this is what sells wow to me. 
---
The sharp edges and corners are offputting and drab
---
God forbid you try to be a little competitive or efficient. Who knows if you level too fast you might miss out on being ganked for hours.
---
Hell yeah it is, orcs are smelly and should go back to Draenor where they came from
---
[Yeah but....](https://i.imgur.com/PPfeVpZ.png)
---
You Never played with impatient players i see.
---
Awesome setup!
---
During peak hours you had over 100,000 people in queue over the various servers.  Some players have given up on their original servers and migrated to yours.
---
Plus we probably have new players coming aboard the hype train.
---
What do you mean 'starting' to 'lag'? If it wasn't hitching before (probably what you really mean) then something is wrong. Time for a backup and fresh install.
---
All this thread has taught me so far is to never have kids
---
I keep hearing 3mins, but I don’t know for certain
---
1hr mail from anyone, but returns are instant

Highest weapon damage. Arms scales of weapon damage and crits.
---
Very cool
---
How many time did you have to do this shoot till it worked?
---
You get into the layer of the party leader that invites you
---
I usually just slam my head on my keyboard and then try to make a name out of it, like my night elf rogue: Oisvu
---
Because staying up all night and sleeping all day is a bad way of living.
---
Source: me
---
I get that too! But I've only noticed it after I activate my orc racial blood fury (is that what it's called?)
---
If it makes you feel better, you probably shouldn't have been playing WoW like that back then either. Just imagine how much more successful you'd be in life if you'd put all that energy somewhere else!
---
Have a silver, friend. I never thought of it like that
---
Cower reduces your pets threat which will make the thing you are fighting more likely to turn to you. Have you trained your pet with the highest levels of growl and bite/claw?
---
Not much of a problem since it's not that humid, it's also being fought by two heaters, and we take the stuff inside overnight.
---
Hah! The people in the instances I’ve been in don’t even wait for one. It’s just all out war on every pull. So far my favorite are the alt tab DoT everything warlocks that run around as if they can get away from mobs in dungeons.
---
plot twist, that's OPs wife and you just got him into deep shit
---
Came to say just that. The general chat usual brings it up when it’s really going. Was questing in it the other day and couldn’t get over how immersive and cool it felt.
---
When you walk into dm what does it say? “Deadmines” it doesn’t say “van cleef” end of debate
---
Clearly a ret paladin
---
I did something similar in storming today, didn't care i missed tons of fish because the conversation was fun.
---
Kirtanos is always high pop during prime time but no queue.
---
"I can't elaborate" = " I have no fucking idea lul"
---
They want to see how fast they can hit 60. Doesn’t matter if someone did it first or faster, it’s about how they stack up against their own best time or something like that.
---
¿qué?
---
All this melodrama makes you look really cringey, just saying.
---
BRAAAAPPPHHHFFH

Actually did. Woke up to 750 up votes was a shock lol
---
 Parkour!
---
Sorry, it sounds like I wasn't clear - I don't think they're going to lower the maximum when they remove layering. We have queue's on some servers right now *because* they don't want to use layering as an excuse to allow more people on the server than it could handle without layering. As far as I understand it, based off the answers given by the dev team in the Q&amp;A, the layering is to help with the strain of having everyone in the same place but *not to help with the amount of people on the server in total*.
---
Here is one of the excerpts that has lead me to think this:
---
&gt;We’re absolutely committed to reaching one layer per realm by Phase 2. This is why we need to have upper bounds on the number of players connected to the realm at one time, and queue players past that point. That, of course, is why we’re willing to open new servers if necessary, and we’ve even started doing that in response to the incredibly positive reception we’ve had during the name reservation period!
---
They explain more about the layering in the Q&amp;A which can be found here:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/q-a-compilation-wow-classic-development-team-ama/260760
---
I mean... I might of course have misunderstood what they're saying - but I wanted to post again just to be as clear as I could because I hate the idea of someone missing out on playing classic wow because they've missunderstood why the devs are doing layering!
---
do i watch his stream? no lol i play the game  
---
i checked in i think 3 separate times and he was in SM every time so
---
This was so hilariously bad and boring. I loved it so much and also hated it.
---
Make sure you have growl (taunt) active on your pet.
---
Use Feign Death if you get aggro, or if it's on CD and you still get aggro use disengage when the mob is close enough.
---
It's not just use snippy and copy/paste the pic on facebook or disc
---
The Horde invaded the quillboars land...not to mention the humans placed the orcs in concentration camps because they you know, invaded their land and numerous groups refused to surrender.
---
Yes you can drop your professions. If I remember right you go to your skills page, click on the profession's bar and it should expand to give the option to drop it. I am running from memory so please do not quote me on this until you confirm.
---
As for savings, I would save as much gold as you can for now. There's bound to be something shiny that catches your eye at level 60. Those epic mounts are not an easy thing to get after all.
---
Few days ago I was on the boat between Ratchet and BB, and an alliance warlock started attacking me.  When I realized I wouldn't survive, I jumped ship and healed up. She started /laughing at me as I now had to wait for the next boat.
---
In desperation, I popped water walk and tried to jump on to the anchor that hangs off the left side, but it was too high.  The ship started leaving and it was pushing me along with it.  Figured I would risk it and see what happened.
---
Ended up transporting me just fine, still water walking and stowed on the front of the anchor.  After the load screen I /targeted the warlock and start emoting toward her, then ran to safety into Ratchet before she could kill me in the water.
---
if you have onedrive installed (you probably do since it comes with windows), pressing print screen automatically creates a screenshot as a file in the cloud drive, which you can access from your phone.
---
Ooh swing and a miss. Continually toxic and trying to dismiss me as or paint me as bad as "right wing" so you don't have to use that think meat between your ears to try and rebut me.
---
Can we get this as a mod for TW3? That'd be fantastic.
---
I was doing the mage quest in undercity where you conjure up some mobs, kill them, and put them in a box. Some mage was standing around looking lost. I helped him kill a few mobs and left him one of my boxes so he could loot it. He then aggroed 3 mobs who then aggroed on me. He didn't help me. Then as I solo killed the last two I needed he just stood there watching me almost die, then ninja loots both boxes. I finished his quest for him basically and all he had to say was "suck it". Made me fuming.
---
Hitting 60 as fast as possible is my primary objective.
---
As a single working professional with plenty of banked leave, no dependants and just generally nothing going on in my life right now I feel like this is one of the few times I can really flex my situation.
---
I'm certain you find fulfillment in your life with your nice family and advancing your education but just know that for the next 1 - 2 weeks ill be living off take-out while partaking in some kind of fucked-up reverse-marathon that involves playing WoW as much as the human body can take while only breaking for minimal amounts of work and sleep I can get away with until the mere sight of the login screen makes me physically ill which only then will I crawl back into the light and accept my judgment and shame. It's gonna be great and I can't wait to do it all again when they re-release BC. It's ok to be envious.
---
I did enjoy Westfall, besides all the mediocre gathering quests. Like making that stew. Deadmines is great though. My first classic dungeon experience.
---
it’s in the directory with the actual game files. not in your documents for some reason.
---
Basically get addon vendorprice or somehow get track of every grey item price in the game and try to dtack those instead of other which sell to a low price.
---
This is why I am only level 20. I swear I have followed dozens of different trails of corpses in the Barrens just skinning away.
---
Hey, you don't have to use it or play any way other than how you want to! That's the beauty of it. You have different priorities than people who put together guides like this or try to shoot to 60 asap, and that's okay! I'm more like you, I still enjoy the exploration and mystery. No add ons, only looking up info after I can't find what I need for a while. And so do the vast majority of people I have played with lately. What's great is that you have to actively try to miss out on the Classic experience. They don't hand anything to you. It's all about your expectations s and finding people who have matching ones that you can group up with and explore together. I am just having a ball doing what I feel like, when I feel like it. But for real, if this game is causing you anything other than joy or relaxation, walking away is a okay also.
---
Yeah, just go into your professions and there's a litle red circle with a line through it to delete. 
---
It really depends on your class. Lesser and greater magic wand, 2h weapon skill, sword skill, and weapons are the big choices, as are filling up any of your bad armor slots with cheap greens, which ideally have stamina on them. 
---
Also, make sure you are saving up money to get your secondary professions upgraded (2 gold, at level 25-30ish, one for each of first aid and cooking). 
---
But generally, looking on the auction house for bargains can be really really good. I rerolled on a more popular server yesterday (just in case, I am going on vacation for a long while in the immmediate future and don't want to come back to a dead server), and I managed to get a 2h axe at level 7 for 6 silver and a level 15 sword for 2 silver more than it vendors for.
---
Those were incredible steals. When you buy something for a couple silver for more than it vendors for, as long as you vendor it eventually, all you end up paying is the price you pay ABOVE vendor.
---
So getting any green warrior gear for 25%-50% above vendor is an insane power spike for surprisingly cheap.
---
Sounds like you're on a power trip ngl
---
No one did this with DM, it's not worth it. It was done with SM cos it was more efficient than questing in the mid 30s when you have to either grind or swap zones a lot.
---
Let's not forget the fact that the Defias Brotherhood is around is Stormwind's fault. The Stonemason's guild rebuilt Stormwind from the ground up. Now, logically for such a massive undertaking, they'd be rewarded, right? Nope. The nobles of stormwind refused to pay because they were already in debt. 
---
Now while the Defias did take out their rage on innocent people and we're far from righteous re els, the fact that they were furious period is justifiable. 
---
But do we hear about that? No. We never hear about how Stormwind is to blame for demanding work they couldn't pay for, caused a massive riot that killed many, and caused the start of a criminal organization.
---
I always love tanaris
---
I been healing with feral spec/ its possible just some heavy pulls you need a full drink as you end the fight oom. Alot of the feral stuff has some int on it as well. If not save a piece or two with spirit and int.
---
Peggle is even more mindless than staring at your character and jumping over and over...
---
The string bend when you landed is so fuckin funny.
---
"Retail" is used to refer to current era WoW, instead of classic
---
I know how to do it multiple ways. But  saying that most people just find it easier to take the picture and upload. After all, it's still readable and it's quick. And again, there's a surprising amount of people who don't use desktop. Mobile is by far reddit's largest platform.
---
The game changes ppls behavior automatically because how it is built. Humans learn fast and adapt if they are challenged. 
---
Even people that never played Vanilla are adjusting. 
---
Just look how fast retail players that never played Vanilla learn to not pull more the 2 mobs at a time. 
---
Gloriuos times to be alive.
---
No,  Bagnon works in both retail and Classic now :)
---
On the other hand, getting to level up to 30.
---
Will try that, thanks.
---
¡Señal!
---
Oof, my second is due any day. I’m so excited but at the same time I know I’ll drift away from the game for a good six months to a year. I’ve been dreaming of the day classic would exist since cata, but now I must budget my time very diligently.
---
I’m glad classic exists now. One day I hope to be able to play with my kids.
---
Really strange thinking these things knowing that 14 years ago I was just an 18 yo kid myself staying up until 5am raiding with my guild.
---
No armor, no magic, no outside help.
---
Thrall broke all 3 of these (I think both of them used a little bit of armor) 
---
Thrall used magic, and as his magic is given to him by the elements, i’d say that counts as outside help aswell.
---
Yep! Also there's generally not a ton of people so it just feels like a really nice chill place to be in.
---
But shhhh don't tell everyone, don't need a bunch of tourists!
---
You lack the time to level up new toons? Before what? Classic isn’t going anywhere. Your guildies has the right idea moving to a new server so they can play at any time they want. No sympathy for people who voluntarily sit in queues so they can complain on Reddit
---
This was a big part of the nostalgia. It sucks, for sure, but this kinda thing made the rewards for finally succeeding so much more meaningful
---
i hope you tell them before they walk to the dungeon then
---
I'm you, but gayer
---
I farmed the green, blue and black whelpling for my girlfriend back then.. it took so much time though i never got the red one and spent most time farming it. gratz man!
---
Wholesome l
---
I enjoyed playing hunter first time around on original release &amp; TBC. Probably the most versatile class, you have more tools in your toolbox to play with than most classes which makes things interesting. Very fun playing solo and defeating enemies with +10 on your level. 
---
Also, don't listen to people that say hunters aren't good at raid dps either.
---
I'm glad you said that because I was thinking about the same thing. My buddy and I were wondering all over an island just exploring things trying to find a spawn for some monster we needed to kill. It was really fun.
---
I'll definitely check those other addons out. Those small changes that are mainly QoL improvements are what I had in mind. Thanks again!
---
Yeah, you're fucking stupid. Try Google first, fucktard
---
Okay... cool. Sorry for being an asshole :D teehee
---
Umadbro?
---
Lmfao
---
World first doesn't matter because it has all already been done.
---
Oh I agree. IRL comes up. But the leaver i had just stayed on and went about something else obviously didn't get their drop most likely. But I guess I'll just have to keep my own list. Thanks.
---
Alt+F4 to see number in queue
---
I think that classic allows more time for these kinds of interactions. In retail people fish between dungeon/raid/arena/bg queues and just phase in and out. In classic people fish to fish so they're probably going to be there for a bit.
---
Whoa dude I actually don't agree with the other person's opinion but at no point in life should we tell each other to kill ourselves - no matter the intensity of the situation.
---
Please!
---
Wandering around last night farming with my brother after not having played wow since WoTLK, the rain started falling as we were wandering around slowly chipping away at quests, never felt such a sense of peace and nostalgia at once before. Truly a beautiful game
---
Heh, we’re not as young as we used to be. That’s okay though, the game isn’t running off anywhere.

Tbf I was specifically talking about SM, because that's all I tried and 12 mins 5 man clears put you nearly on par with 6 min Cath + Arms clears due to gaining double XP in 5s Vs 10s. 
---
Makes sense once you get to large dungeons with really spaced mob packs that you'd start needing more people to remain competitive because you won't be hitting lockouts with 5.
---
I'm just glad it's gone because finding groups to run normally was hard and as a mage rolling against 8 other cloth users was shockingly awful. Especially when a few got replaced every other run, took me 12 rolls to get the neck from Cath. But it sure as hell was fun for a bit.
---
Bitches?
---
I'm not going to make bag space for a useless item. My bags are full of useful shit, no way I'll drop something for a piece of cheese.
---
Awwweh fizzie I had fun with you ma dude. I hope we meet again soon on even terms heh
---
This is kinda why I names myself Gaychris as well. I was very uncomfortable with my sexual orientation as I was mocked a lot when I was younger and bullied a lot in school. Naming myself Gaychris was just a way for people to just say “hey that’s your name. Cool. Don’t stand in void zones” over time I just kind of got used to being okay with being gay. Now I take pride in who I am irl and love telling people the truth if they ask rather than hide! All thanks to a video game to help me along my adventure of life.
---
The queues are ruff 😐
---
Fck this..killed 500 of those, 26 to 29..didnt get
---
You should have been taking a picture of a screenshot on your computer
---
Keep in mind that the frames above mobs doesn't show up until the mobs are close, unlike in retail. The range are limited in classic
---
Electrical engineering is insanely complex.
---
This comment...this one here made me crack up bad.
---
Well done.
---
They already said they will merge servers or do transfers if servers start to die out.
---
*and literally noone is listening*
---
JUsT tAuNt IT
---
I don't know. The ones I used didn't work.
---
Now THAT’S how you take a screenshot!
---
You must have abnormally long arms to be able to reach that far.
---
Tell me when your on
---
How do you suppose I go about banning bug abusers in this game?
---
Yeah it seriously set the atmosphere of the zone
---
Found the guy no one wants to play with!
---
 /reload reloads your ui. Great if you have interface bug.
---
I LOVE your style! This is fantastic!!
---
Hi, /u/AmazingAdventurer
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyz451/5_reasons_you_should_play_world_of_warcraft/). 
---
The queues are a bit of a bitch, but at the same time the servers are **packed** there are people everywhere, at every level. It’s great! 
---
And hopefully, it’ll stay that way for at least a couple of months. 
---
The only thing I’m a bit mad about is that there are no spanish EU servers.. ( no idea if this is the case for retail)
---
I haven't played WoW since Burning Crusade so this might be a dumb question, when you say corpse run do you just mean running back to your body as a ghost? Is that not in the game anymore?
---
Thanks for this!
---
Do demo and battle shout generate threat evening when refreshing their effects or only on first application?
---
Will make start attack macros now.
---
There are tons but most of them became un obtainable after wrath and cata
---
Unfortunately Blizzard seems to have ripped threat API out. Used to be able to color code nameplates to see what I do and don't have threat on, now I have to use a janky damage meter that doesn't seem to work half the time.
---
- Spells/Abilities: As you level up these will become increasingly more expensive, if you want to learn all your new abilities then you should have a decent stockpile of gold.  
---
- Mount: As you've mentioned a faction mount is 90-100G, it takes quite a while to farm this up and ideally you want to be close to it by the time you hit 40 otherwise you'll be at a disadvantage. At 60 you can get an epic mount which is 900-1000G, so you'll generally want to save for that down the road.  
---
- Professions: In my experience it's best to level professions as you're playing, otherwise you end up buying a ton of materials from the AH, or spending hours going back to low level areas to skin/mine/gather. If you are leveling up these professions as you go, you'll only need to take a few seconds to hit that node while you're doing your usual gaming.  
---
- Gear is useful depending on the class, sometimes buying a good rogue/warrior/hunter weapon is a better investment for your gold because you'll be able to fight stronger opponents and kill them faster. 
---
P.S. You can drop professions at any time and get any new ones, but you will start from 0 if you do. You can have a maximum of 2 'main' professions (e.g. Skinning/Herb/Alch/BS/Mining/Engineering/Tailoring/Enchanting) and as many of the secondary professions (e.g. First Aid, Cooking, Fishing).
---
Lul what? They're both literally playing games. Don't act like one is objectively worthy of idololizing and the other isn't.
---
 I hear this from both sides... Gamer says "Sports are dumb it's just guys chasing a ball around"
---
Athlete says "Video games are dumb, it's just pressing buttons looking at a screen"....
---
Try to think outside of your own opinion and self interests.
---
&gt; The only one I really liked was SWTOR but it was lacking.
---
The world building was pretty poor in SW:TOR.  There weren't random rooms in the cities like you have in IF/Ogri/SW.  All the 'extra' rooms in any city-type place were blocked off behind red force fields and you couldn't enter without the quest.
---
That's what broke me in SW:TOR -- there was no place to stop and chat with friends without feeling like a vagrant standing on some impersonal street corner.
---
It was BiS in BC
---
Battle shout and demo shout can be spammed for threat generation.
---
Battle shout provides significantly more threat if you are able to buff multiple people.
---
It's VERY common for people to spam battle should after using 1-2 sunders to lock everything to you for a bit.
---
its for pve to enable to for pvp to disable
---
Druids regen mana in shapeshift + Innervate. Paladins have BoW + SoW procs, so I don't see it too likely. :P
---
Tell me when can keep track of rend and hamstring etc
---
And get the weapon swing timer, especially for a warrior
---
Price above vendor is a huge one. Installing a vendor price addon is amazing for new players.
---
There are highly desirable items like silvered bronze shoulders, and it's really tough to say "are these worth it?". You have to know how likely you are to find replacement mail shoulders, how much money you will earn in the future, what your time will be worth, all that stuff. It's hard.
---
But when an item vendors for 15 silver and you pay 18? All you have to know is "is this item useful to me now?". 
---
If the answer is yes, you got a deal.
---
Gotcha. Thank you!
---
This is where player notes come in handy. Leave your future self a warning
---
&gt; crowds of players flooding off of/onto the zeppelin/boats
---
This is something that got destroyed by Cata (with all the portals and flying) and I really do miss it.  That short wait makes a big difference in immersion.
---
The boats in EQ1 were epic, usually 5 or so minutes of role-play while you sailed across Ocean of Tears.
---
Such little things can help in such a big way. It's an awesome aspect of the game in its current state. I ran past a dude taking on a mob, he seemed ok but it was casting a long cast. Swoosh, Rawr, Bink. I charge in and interrupt the cast and carry on. I just love doing those little things, they definitely add up. 
---
I'm just loving everything about this game right now.
---
Hmmm I seem to remember briefly stepping foot in Tanaris. Although I’ve never quested through there. I’ll put it on the list.
---
Sounds exactly like me. 18 month old kid and work takes up around 11 hours a day including the commute. 
---
Every night I can’t wait to relive my teens and kill some boars. And even then, some nights I don’t get to because their is other important things to do. And all that is ok because those few hours a week I do get to play is amazing :)
---
Sweet, I'm gonna check it out thanks
---
press p
---
it was for the greater good
---
if you seem someone coming keep your loot window open, (press shift if you have autoloot on). They can't do anything until you take it. Stand there long enough and they'll leave
---
Have you trained your higher ranked spells? 
---
As a paladin min rank 1 holy light heals for 40hp while rank 4 holy light heals for 400. 
---
Remember to manually swap out the ranks aswell, doesnt happen automatically
---
Oh come on we've all done it
---
The Grudgebook IS friendly fire
---
NO SIR! \*EATS OWN ASS"
---
Im happy a game ha shown you most people are just normal people, the world being speckled with retards here and there. Im sad it took a video game to show it.
---
&gt; You lack the time to level up new toons? Before what? Classic isn’t going anywhere. 
---
Here, I'll try to break it down a bit easier: 
---
* Group of friends who have been playing together since Vanilla decided to take off of work and level up together.  
---
* During this time we leveled up together, ran several dungeons, getting some great loot, and leveling professions.  
---
* Time off is now over, play time is limited, but we made a huge dent in the leveling of classic.
---
Important things to remember:
---
* Blizzard warned us that queues on Herod would be shit, they recommended we roll on Skeram.
---
* We rolled on Skeram, now queues are still 6-7k each night.
---
Now, you're suggesting that we re-roll, without the time off, and do this over again... rather than having Blizzard move our guild to a non-populated realm?  I think it would be more beneficial to offer the ability to transfer to a non-full realm as a guild.
---
Hahahaha alright man.
---
Dippy bird stock has shot up astronomically.
---
So much has happened... damn I wish I had those days back.
---
I was never sure of the mechanics either - there was some way of resetting there "default" position - he definitely would kill people, and return to a specific spot if he left combat.
---
It does improve and the offheal ability is nice. Personally i prefer balance but cat is fine, you wont be a mage or a hunter but you’ll be fine.
---
If you’re considering a re-roll though, better sooner than later, and i don’t think druid is going to be as fast as it seems you’d like.
---
Initial reactions are good, but CEO of Blizzard said himself that classic needs to be popular enough for long enough before they consider further classic expansions. 
---
Basically, if enough resubs play classic consistently for a year, chances are good for another expansion. 
---
I'm worried that it's just going to be a passing fad, though I'm having fun with it regardless.
---
Grobbulus
---
Sorry I sure did, I will repost right now thanks for the heads up.
---
You must play on Benediction (: we have a queue of less than 200 today!
---
For the love of god, it's so annoying when I'm tanking on my Paladin and people just unload all dps at once.
---
I'm not a Warrior. I don't have a Taunt guys. I need to BUILD up my threat via holy attacks + Righteous Fury.
---
Don't be dicks. Lol.
---
Naw I messed up sorry I will repost.
---
Yeah I don’t compare it to drugs because I’ve known people with bad drug addictions and it doesn’t compare. But it’s a good exaggerated comparison.
---
This guy has more IRL friends that play WoW than I have IRL friends in general lmao
---
I'd suggest making it into a separate addon. there's quite a few addons for HN.
---
hey you can generalize anything u want to m8, the worlds your oyster. now when i say that, understand i am not saying the world is an oyster. you following me m8? just so u know
---
Druid is decent
---
So you gotta make this for every mob?
---
How the fuck do you guys have that much time?
---
go into interface options (in game) and then go to ActionBars, and then put a check mark in "Stack Right Bars Vertically".
---
Nope, I have not.
---
I'd do it online to be patronizing is a situation like that for sure.
---
OH MAN I NEED THE KARMA NOW I CANT PROPERLY SUBMIT IT I NEED KARMA NOW!!!!
---
My server rattlegore had a full que tonight. First time since I started on thurs or Friday. I got in under 4 min. Was about 300-500 ppl trying get in
---
Yeah i get it, you wanted karma.
---
Thank you
---
It takes you less time to clear your bag of a useless item that it does to have to loot anything individually. You need to change your ways
---
A swing timer. I made one through weakauras but there are plenty of options. 
---
OmniCC is great for CD timers as well and i always recommend that.
---
Should of stayed in Durotar you filthy green skin. Lol jk. Looks about right though.
---
umm what? no that's not okay either. Not sure why you think that
---
You shouldn't probably tell jokes because you're shit at them.
---
Clearly no one got your joke.
---
Some of us do!
---
It’s only phase 1. This is why it was released in phases so they could fix things.
---
Depending on the server, people are selling leather on the AH for basically vendor price, and there are plenty of crafting patterns that can double your money. At one point I just spent an hour buying and crafting while watching a show and I made 13g for nothing.
---
I like to cast my big heal followed by a HoT to maximize my mana regen time.
---
Yeah I can see that, personally my go to would be "pal" or "bud/buddy"
---
&gt; I'm just sitting here enjoying the game I waited 1.5 years for.
---
I wasn't waiting for it, didn't think I'd play it, figured it was over-hyped.
---
Dang, I've been online for a few hours every day since launch (not counting queue times!).  Struggling to login to retail to renew my auctions.
---
If we all died we would solve world hunger.
---
That's about how useful your fact was because an entire playerbase is not going to go grinding nonquest mobs.
---
Well at low level I figured I would yeah, until I felt ready. I thought that was the whole point of the toggle. Lesson learned! I like it more this way frankly. You shouldn't just be able to waltz through the opposing faction's turf waving at everyone, like I just did haha. Now I'm surprised that I wasn't attacked sooner.
---
Doesn't beat 2005 Google searches for wow yet though
---
you have a phone dont you ?
---
Mousemover on your phone.
---
Lmao
---
And when you finally get in you will find questing or even just grinding very difficult.  Quest mobs are camped by multiple people and a quest which normally would take 5 mins suddenly takes 2 hours.  So fun
---
Wasn't he fired from being superman?
---
Report them to blizzard. I don't know, literally anything is a better solution than what you're currently doing.
---
Guarantee the people talking the most shit about him are also constantly watching him. How else would you know all this? How could you know what he does? 
---
That's the saddest part about this community, the hate watchers have become mainstream. Tall poppy syndrome is running rampant, and it's beyond pathetic.
---
Hillsbrad is insanely populated on stalagg.
---
low level areas don't always get greens. a lot of the time it's just junk.
---
pre hotfix
---
I wish I knew enough for LUA to do it.  It seems fairly easy but I don't have the time to start learning a new language so I'm just putting it out there
---
LOL it actually made me feel good seeing this xD its the little things in life
---
All wow youtubers post tons of classic wow content lately. Like literally everyone;)
---
Yah an AWSOME PLAYER! alliance bretheran rise up
---
How do you toggle on the skill improvement blue text in chat? For example, I want to know if my skill in a weapon or skinning increases, is there a way to show this?
---
I lol'ed
---
Yeah you have to go to your pet trainer (usually close to the hunter trainer) and learn skills every level or so. In your skills book you are going to have a pet tab for the pet that needs to be brought to the bar.
---
Gotta admire a group of lads that roll that deep.
---
I somewhat understand the reluctance to add too many servers. What i dont understand is the refusal to just up to caps on the current servers to a point where there are no longer queues. 
---
I mewn i know they collect all the data snyd know the amount of players on a server at any given time. So why not just raise them again and then lower them back down to a more comfortable number when the population stabalizes. 
---
What am I missing?
---
Cars are effective at that.
---
Which one is Kyle?
---
I'm being very careful not to outlevel my proffs this time around. I spent all day yesterday leveling my professions and fishing instead of leveling. I'm still only level 23.
---
Kargoz has good content and plays warlock
---
What gets me most are the shadows... they’re Unreal©️
---
Everquest ships didn’t have the instant travel time. They were long as shit, and sometimes a shark would teleport into the sails and kill your ass for good measure
---
No, well, kinda
---
At the moment the community is great, because everyone is still high on the nostalgia. But the gameplay is tedious and suuuper grindy. 
---
There has been a ton of QoL changes, and the gameplay is way better in retail, but there is no community, unless you get into a big, friendly, active guild
---
Honestly I think it has more to do with the location of herbs. People who aren't herbalists stand around herbs all the time, because they're right there. Ore is usually around the border or on an "island" inside the map, so if someone is standing on top of ore it's easier to know why vs someone standing near an herb
---
No one's there yet. I was in westfall today on myzrael and it was a complete zoo. Every mob was being farmed by someone, usually by multiple competing 5 mans trying to tag stuff.
---
What's the plan for the inspection at Theramore?
---
I spat my water. Amazing
---
Sorry for asking a lot of basic as questions but could you recommend me a good add on?
---
This is the only reason to play alliance
---
First I thought you had been waiting in queue since 1941
---
I'm about to try tanking myself.
---
If this crap starts up, I'm telling the healer to stop healing DPS. They pull aggro, they die. That will help them learn pretty damn quick.
---
I was previously a hunter-main, and not taking aggro from the tank was always one of my main tenets.
---
How is sharing a fishing pool not okay.
---
You can't toggle your pvp flag in contested/enemy zones dude...
---
The flag really only exists for nonpvp servers but it makes 0 sense for them to program it to not exist in pvp servers
---
Never seen anything like that happen b4. Try to cintact a GM.
---
Yea but the issue here is there is no need button in master loot. The item drops he takes it, end of story.
---
I think it's important to take the tone of the post into account.  As you can see with OP's comment, they are being passively aggressive, as well as swearing on top of calling out peoples behaviour that they doesn't agree with.  This isn't the way to discuss why one thing is better than another, this type of language is simply inciteful and will only see responses in kind.  Thus, starting a flame war.
---
If OP brought it up with much kinder language and zero aggression its more likely they wouldn't be banned, I think.
---
*&lt;laughs in Paladin&gt;*
---
*&lt;goes OOM&gt;*
---
*&lt;cries in Paladin&gt;*
---
My experience as a lvl 20 so far is I've noticed things like boots, gloves, belts, etc are vendoring for like 2-4 silver while weapons are vendoring for 20-40 silver so pretty much I'd recommend just avoiding d/eing weapons atleast.
---
It's these types of random encounters that have made me smile the most in Classic so far. 
---
Not exactly the same, but I was doing a quest in Barrens that was a few lvls above what I could really handle. Human comes waltzin' on up and it kinda caught me off guard. 2-3 mobs spawned around me and I thought it was gonna be a trip to the graveyard. Human was a total bro though. He pulled them all himself and rekt em. Then he just turns around, gives me a thumbs up and goes back on his merry way. 
---
That may not be all that out of the ordinary or even that great of a story in general, but it was one of the best experiences I've had in an online game in a LONG time.
---
So you’re not complaining about the queue? I’m confused.
---
I know it's a tough concept to grasp.. But no one made you or your friends stay on an overpopulated server. You made that choice.
---
&gt;that they have been using since the original launch of the game and already have character in the 30s is not a realistic solution.
---
Maybe you should have rerolled before you got a character in the 30s? Like Blizzard told you to do? You know, when the queues **were even worse**?
---
It seems there ar edifferent requirement for gathering and production.
---
&gt; You must obtain a certain player level to train the next rank
---
&gt; 
---
&gt;     Apprentice(75) - Level 5 for Production/Fishing and no req for Gathering
---
&gt;     Journeyman(150) - Level 10 for Production/Fishing and no req for Gathering
---
&gt;     Expert(225) - Level 20 for Production, Level 10 for Gathering and Fishing
---
&gt;     Artisan(300) - Level 35 for Production, Level 25 for Gathering, Level 10 for Fishing
---
Taken from https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-professions-overview

nelf racials dont really make or break class choice
---
both have ways to speed up
---
hunter is one of the best solo classes in the game
---
As long as you don't lead with Earth Shock before I even deal the first hit I'm ok with it.
---
Real torture is when your new and think it’s cool to swim until you drown n die and have no idea where your corpse or you are ...😫😩
---
I feel this. I'm a warrior (only lvl 21 so far) but I \~really\~ want to play a hunter, and also a rogue. The struggle is real for altoholics.
---
Technically speaking isn’t it against the tos to use any form of virtual stream of your pc for wow? It’s why you can’t play via steam link or the nvidia shield program.
---
First time GRIZZLY killed anything without exploiting lul
---
You’re amazing, thank you!
---
Has a priest. You get ONE renew per pull.
---
With so many pets as a hunter, how do I know which I should use?
---
People die on retail?  I honestly don't think that is possible.  
---
While leveling I always pull everything in range, and never get close to dying.
---
I always thought they were a toxic guild but this proves they are reformed. Grats guys.
---
I’m asking if there happened to be news about queues for the full population servers.
---
did that guy pick his IRL hairstyle in the character customization settings?
---
To be honest the change in pace is nice, as long as I feel like I’m making some progress to an end goal. I may even skip the Blight league as I think it looks pretty average and focus on classic instead.
---
Yes, there was news over a week ago, expect hour long queues on those servers. You picked a server available from day 1, youre gonna have issues.
---
Bad router or just a dead spot?
---
Ecke Ecke Ecke Ecke Ptang Zoo Boing
---
Well right now im paying to play when I really can't, im forced to play when there is zero queue.
---
Kinda feels like a rip off.
---
thats a loaded title lmao
---
There is no end, we BFA now
---
Thanks that was super helpful. It looks like my hardest decision is going to be a quest trinket for Dodge Crit or Spell Crit which is basically irreplaceable for each spec otherwise most everything is drops.
---
Invisibility*
---
Otherwise I’m diggin it. Who’s shelling out gold for invisipotions a week into classic?
---
I like your style. If you’re looking for a good group of Hordies to work together with, consider joining &lt;Final Flame&gt; on Deviate Delight (NA RPPVP server)!
---
Even people with responsibilities can take time off. XD
---
According to their older answers layering was mostly for dealing with what was commonly referred to as the "tourist" problem. That is, people with current subscriptions who just login to Classic to see what it's all about, most of whom will leave within a week or two. Though my information could have come by second hand, I forget when/where it is I heard of this.
---
In your quote and in the Q&amp;A I don't see anything that would overturn this way of seeing the situation. I take that quote to mean, "Our original estimate of the percentage of players that will loose interest and leave isn't in question therefor, we won't budge from our preconceived player caps." And there is no reason yet why they should be questioning their assumption I'm sure. I feel as though this potential problem is below their radar. If the rate players drop off is much slower than they anticipated I'm sure they'll make an announcement in the next week or two, but I wouldn't expect one this soon.
---
Your concern is heartening, but missing out on a few weeks of Classic isn't going to make or break the experience for me. Thank you for your concern though.
---
I love mulgore in general
---
Doesn't work for me either.
---
The file reverts itself.
---
I deleted the backup, saved it... And it saved this time, but nothing on the map.
---
OP: do you have your file minus sensitive info? Maybe the format is a little weird?
---
Thanks
---
Disgusting play world of warcraft, not what ever the fuck retail is
---
I understand, I was in that mindset, but I do believe the population will stay thriving even after the hype!
---
A lot of the classic lore leads up into cata(and some of legion), which is cool they had that much lore baked in so early into the game
---
I've let too many mages die doing that. Not waiting for tank, just go in, CoC and spam Arcane Explosion. I used to shield them and panic heal, fuck that.
---
I was like wow so much heat going on but why there is one empty chair. The I realized he’s taking this picture
---
Swing timer, questie (+guidelime but that's my preference), some UI addon (I really like elvUI and it covers a lot of QoL stuff which would otherwise require specific addons like dot timers and whatnot), WeakAuras.
---
So you get a 2nd shot and that’s what you come up with?  Claiming you baited me by calling me a filthy casual?  In that case, yes. You are certainly a master baiter.  And I’m sure you’ve had plenty of practice at that.  Layers and layers of master baiting.
---
Thunderfury is pretty cool. High pop during prime time and med during other times
---
First npc's that killed me, I was planning on not dying til close to lvl 10. J fucking K. All I wanted was their chest but I died about 3 times in a row just trying to get away from them.
---
Thank you Buzz
---
Like make a gathering only character like mining/skinning something like that.  I love hunters and would maybe level to Macchio but mostly for money
---
Thank you friend
---
if u don't play classic or wow u can't see it though
---
Oh okay I'm not totally up to speed on professions. What if I just grabbed skinning and herbalism to make cash?
---
Friend who keeps getting ganked! Haha
---
Just calling it as I see it. It's not like I'm not even stretching here, let alone making things up. Now you're all offended and upset. Perhaps you shouldn't do stupid shit that deserves being pointed out? That's how most people approach life: Don't do stupid shit if you can't handle being called out on it.
---
Seriously... you took a shitty cell phone screenshot. Then you whited out the name of someone that not a single person on reddit gives a single flying fuck about. That should be pointed out. And not only should it be pointed out, you should be made fun of to the point where other people seeing this won't do the same stupid stuff.
---
You know that "PRINT SCREEN" button on the keyboard? You press that button. Then you open paint and press Ctrl+V. Voila. It's done.
---
...though I have a feeling every single thing on you're screen would be either whited out or cropped out. Like some kinda conspiracy theorist. "The government will find me based on my shitty looking UI!" That's all I got. Can't think of anything rational.
---
Corrupted blood April fools
---
You had to be there.
---
You ganna criticize a woman soley on her looks just cause she doesnt play a specific game, how shallow can you get?
---
Modem issue - I am swapping it out tomorrow
---
Skeram and Stalagg were overflow servers from Herod and were full as soon as they went live. You knew this. In response, Blizzard launched several new servers on Day 1 and none have them have ANY queues. Blizzard has done all they needed to do to address the Herod problem and smart players switched early on. They even raised the realm cap two days in, and you STILL didn’t switch. It’s not feasible to ask Blizzard to initiate realm transfers one week in when server communities are still being established.

There’s no 5 mans in vanilla that are too hard to cleave through. It mostly comes down to group comp, level and gear whether it’s a good idea or not. That difficult 5 mans where you actually had to carefully cc and pull didn’t exist until tbc with heroics.
---
Yeh I’ve never had clutter issues and I’m playing warrior. Just takes moderation and knowing what to trash
---
That's probably bartender. You can make it look however you want. Get it, try it out. It can do what you want from it.
---
AH so if I did mining/engineering would I be able to make my own arrows?
---
I know it's against the TOS but how likely is it to be banned for account sharing? I want to play my buddys rogue just to go around and mindlessly gank people. Not sure how risky it is or if Blizzard really cares (again I know its against TOS just want to hear what has happened to others).
---
Sweet, good luck mate :)
---
They already increased the amount of players that can be online. Don't expect more to be done. If you want to stay on that server, you just have to deal with the queues.
---
Why so convoluted.  I keep a macro that says
---
/tar (mobs name here)
---
Accomplished the same thing
---
There’s a good chance too though that these people are just playing around on an alt because their main server queue is an hour or two and they just wanna play for a bit. They may have no intention of staying or ever logging on that server again except to mess around.
---
Take my updoot.
---
Alright. What's a good Warlock leveling specc? Even with 2 points in improved voidwalker I am still pulling aggro. Even when I dot and wait a little bit before wanding, I pull aggro
---
That's not classic. 
---
That error code is telling you to run the launcher through battle net, so try that.
---
Don't worry guys, these will be the people yelling at blizzard telling them to release more content next week because they are "bored". People like this are what kills games this day and age imo. While the rest of us are sub 40, they no lifed it for 7 straight days.
---
The front page for the BFA tab shows you how to get to classic...
---
I mean he's a warrior. There's a lot of insane warrior drops in SM. But the majority of the time I've seen him was questing in 5 man's. Also I think it's fair to say people are allowed to enjoy the game in their own way. Even if he was racing in dungeons to 60 the WHOLE time which I know he wasn't, what's wrong with that? He's wanting to get to max to do shit with the other streamers and get his raids n what not done. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with that
---
Non-full realms have no queue.
---
Seriously consider playing on Deviate Delight (NA RPPVP server). We have an awesome group of people within our guild that are truly enjoying the journey and love to help each other. If you’d like more info, feel free to to reach out to me on Discord (Elocin#7152). Our guild name is &lt;Final Flame&gt;.
---
Cheers!
---
this is so good
---
Not only that, but he *healed* for everyone that he killed.  The shadowbolts alone would simply make him a massive annoyance.  The fact that every volley he sent out would heal him up to full meant he was invincible.
---
As someone who still played old school runescape 6 years after launch until Classic launched, I'm optimistic, though the game was bleeding subs until they started doing new content that was never in the main game, so I think that's necessary
---
I first made a night elf when I started and fell in love with everything about them. Darn tootin I made a nelf priest first day. I love it
---
The only exception I've noticed are helms/shoulders. People really want to fill that slot so they would buy gear for 1g or 1.5g, the rest is better off to be vendored.
---
multiple reasons - you are ahead of the curve slightly maybe, layering, and lot of people farming dungeons exclusively to level
---
No more play?
---
Oh wow thank you.
---
I'm rolling Alliance this time to appease a friend and I'm so bummed about it.  Filthy cites with rat problems on top of gaudy infrastructure and poor layout...
---
But really the other side was always this great mystery and now it's all over.  I've seen how you filthy Alliance live and I'm not a fan.   But in order to play with my friend I'll be sucking it up.
---
more like 5.
---
I like how even setting it to max will only render characters in that tiny circle -_-
---
Sort of. You actually forge shells for guns, but there is a repeatable quest that you can turn in your shells for arrows if you use a crossbow or bow. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7342
---
No.
---
F
---
Look at all the money people just leave laying around. I will say though that people have asked me if I’m coming or not.
---
It depends on the realm and time of day. Herod and Stalagg were both well above 6000 people at around 3PM EST today
---
Surprisingly it wasn't warm at all haha!
---
How do you get guild tags to show under names? I looked through settings 3 times :|
---
It costs me 1s 20c to go from xroads to one stop away.
---
Just have a general target macro that u change when u have to kill a named mob and ur not sure where he is. Really useful fir locating some quest mobs
---
I don't get it
---
&gt;Also, dont tell anyone this
---
I'm going to tell everyone this
---
That's cool. Still not a instance duegon and shouldnt be compared to it
---
That looks like the BfA log-in screen...
---
FOR THE LAN!!
---
Well, not all mobs are going to get fooled by your ridiculous acting skills
---
That's for when you're in your own zone. AKA as a Horde in Barrens If I have it disabled an alliance couldn't attack me. If I enable it however an alliance can attack me. If I have it disabled and go to a neutral zone or to an alliance zone, it doesn't matter because I am in enemy territory. (The reason you could still get ganked is because you were in enemy territory.)
---
Did you aggro Aggie?
---
I use Necrosis. It has a lot more features that I feel are redundant but the dot tracker and other cd trackers are nice.
---
thats the issue im having. i use to be able to play guilt free for 12+ hours a day. now i play for 2 hours and have a borderline anxiety attack because i feel like im just wasting my life away. i think i just outgrew marathon gaming. you are right though. i just need to relax and not take gaming so seriously like i used to
---
But it looks so great!
---
You’re throwing dynamite. You don’t have to run up the ramp. You can literally do it from down on the ground like 40 yards away. You really think Gann wants you to get right up next to it and blow yourself up?
---
One of my friends heard me talking about wow and started playing Runescape again. I never played RuneScape but I keep telling him HES PLAYING THE WRONG GAME. He says wow is “intimidating”. I’ll convince him sooner or later
---
Fucking-A.
---
Just trying to launch the game to see if it can even run on my old PC before I spend 15 on the classic membership
---
Duskwood has some fun quest lines.
---
Yeah two gathering profs should make you some money. You'll def have to invest in some bags though!
---
I love classic but honestly for me it’s the worgen narrative. I love it so much.
---
Holy shit
---
Skinning is worse.
---
Appreciate that. I suppose a mix of all of it. I tend to not stick to just one thing. I like world PvP. BGs. Even tho they weren’t in vanilla I hope they add arenas so that there’s more PvP. Hopefully rated BGs too. Just curious on if there was/is a superior healer.
---
Yup, and don't fool yourself. It doesn't come with a pay raise unless you ask
---
I really hope the paper plates were for the chips ahoy and Oreos
---
Lmao meant girlfriend aggro
---
So you have never PVP'd in your years of playing and you call your point of view 'a little one-sided'?
---
Imagine someone saying 'I've never PVE'd in my 15 years of playing world of warcraft but is it me or does Icecrown Citadel suck compared to Naxxramas'. Wouldn't your first reaction be 'but you haven't even been inside of either of them'?
---
With that being said I 100% agree with the Hillsbrad Foothills part, it sucks for horde.
---
No stat difference afaik. Not until WotLK when people started staming the spectral pets rare pets actually had a different practical function unobtainable from common beasts
---
This is fucked up in so many ways...
---
3 hours today on whitemane around 3pm
---
Weird. Was this on an EU server or NA?
---
Level 40 mount goes 60% lvl 60 goes 100%
---
What level did you reach?
---
Oof Duskwood scares me for some reason lol
---
There's no economy for this yet, gotta wait for people to have gold to blow.
---
It should! :D
---
Faerie fire will help!
---
Feral until +2 talents on kitty speed, 5 your choice in resto, about 24 talent points w/ kitty focus and faerie fire, rest into resto seems like the best compromise betw healing and leveling speed.
---
Hunter is great and the best levelers, and at endgame druid is only viable as a healer. Go hunter
---
You had a different experience than I did then. Regardless, we all know dire maul is in classic so I don’t see why people would make the argument to begin with at this point.
---
No loot for an Alliance hunter in here... that's why I never do it.
---
Kromcrush has been great so far! Busy but not obnoxious. Peak times I'll have a 15-30 minute queue but otherwise I can usually get in right away.
---
What do you mean by a "healing" set? 
---
I know you mean probably having a second set of gear to use for instances/raids (any dungeons) for when I need to heal instead of main gear for leveling - but what exactly is good healing gear? Certain stats I should look for?
---
It also seems like some paths that are likely to see "less traffic" can actually get a little overgrown. I like that.
---
With bags this small I can't use auto loot
---
How do I turn the markers off in BFA?
---
N
---
As suggested below, ethernet cable is going to be better than wi-fi. Failing that, you can scan the wi-fi channles using an app and switch your wi-fi over to a less used frequency if you are in a high population area, like an apartment building with lots of neighbours. 
---
You can also download a program called glass wire which will show you network traffic from your computer and allow you to identify anything that is taking up bandwidth in the background. Often Microsoft, in their infinite wisdom, will hijack your connection for updates despite you using it for gaming at the time. Try switching other connected devices off as well, see if that has an impact.
---
Huh, there you go. I thought it wasn't in place until phase 2.
---
Smart trick - doesn’t it also display something on the portrait?
---
As a healer, I could do this, but an unlucky pair of crits back to back could always happen in a leveling dungeon.
---
Less than a 1% chance of happening, but still not worth it to me.
---
How do you play Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder, or any table-top RPG? You play the game as normal and at points you can either react in a way that would be appropriate with your character, or you get together with a bunch of other players to go on adventures or interact with one another while all playing in-character. Roleplaying in WoW is mostly done cooperatively rather than by one's self.
---
Yeah, but if i wanted BfA, I'd play BfA.
---
You ever turn on war mode?
---
This is only when there's two of us going for the node
---
Quest in RFK! [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5801/kraul-guano](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5801/kraul-guano)
---
Can you also explain what you mean by having some crappy gear for healing gear? I get having other gear that is better for when I need to heal - but what kind of gear should I look for and get? Some specific stat like int or mana?
---
yep still there in fact, trying to tame me a wind serpent!
---
You can only go as fast as the lockouts allow you to. That means 5 instances per hour. That's easily doable as a 5 man, and since you get more xp as a 5man grp they are therefore faster.
---
What you could do is combine lib/arm runs with a 10man group since they share the same instance. You would need to complete a run in 6 mins for optimal xp. That's not that easy to pull off and generally requires more effort than simply spamming 5mans. The marginally better XP rates are therefore somewhat justified imo.
---
Cat helps a bit but it’s really lvl 40 or so when cat actually feels good. Druid has heaps and travel form which help a lot but killing is always hard work.
---
As a warlock, I found problems when grouping with other warlocks since the dots look the same. Even running auradurations it was still hard to tell. Set up weakauras and have been so happy. Highly recommend if you need to track debuffs
---
Here I am with a tauren that has my irl name. I feel like someone who has named their pet cat "Steve".
---
It honestly is a lot of AFK time as well as just talking to people and not doing a damn thing.  Either way!  This game is a GRIND.
---
3 hours today on Fairbanks, starting at 5pm pst.
---
With the amount of remasters we've had in the past decade, I'd be surprised if this WoW to WoW:C was the first instance this ever happened
---
I actually thanked Blizzard too. If someone were to do a word cloud of classic vs BFA at launch I think it would clearly show how the games are different.
---
The tournament would have been hella exploitable with layering, I'm assuming.
---
You can also only set the 'foliage' setting to lowest, this way you have ultra graphics and can still see the q items.
---
Or use Wowhead's in-game link.
---
Because of the bag situation, I always open the chests while holding shift. Because who wants to take a precious bag slot with a banana? Or a single solitary silverleaf when you have no herbalist / alchemist?
---
This is happening to me too and reloading UI and game won’t fix it, I dunno.
---
Oh... that's why herbs give me so much trouble.
---
Mine's been like this all evening
---
They literally had a stream on their channel titled race to world first. 
---
This revision of history is absolutely hilarious.
---
You absolutely can heal leveling dungeons in a dps spec. It's only at the endgame you really need to be specced as a healer. Basically nobody levels in a healing spec unless they have a partner they're playing 100% of the time with.
---
Yes you can heal all dungeons as a shadow priest.  I'm a spriest myself. Questing/solo is great. For dungeons I heal 90% of the time and DPS once in a while
---
Warrior is really sucking even with a hunter in my group. I feel totally worthless.
---
You can heal fine as shadow while levelling :)
---
Westfall for PvE for sure. High pop queueless alliance.
---
I find happiness from yoinking chest so...
---
Loktar
---
I mean I wonder how many of them are fake, but still, I'm going to take some time off just in case...
---
I have heard others claiming that when they logged back on they found that they we’re rewound for lack of a better term. Same location but levels and xp reversed. Maybe it’s a bug?
---
Good Idea, gotta do this as well.
---
AKA "its not a bug, its a feature"
---
Oh thanks for this I just have a /target macro and change to the mon I’m looking for but didn’t know u could filter out if they’re dead
---
He's right... You will be ruining a good thing!!
---
dude yes! I would love a chance to charge in and be killed
---
I sure as hell wasn't playing that shit.
---
But if you notice, will you pass judgment?
---
Yea we had a good laugh about it too in our group during our lan.
---
Magic, Human Mage of Ashkandi.
---
Shift+b
---
I realised this yesterday evening. I made a rogue.
---
Biggest issues for me (at level 22):
---
Hunter pet specials sometimes fail. When in the 8-25 yard range my boar fails to charge like 50% of the time.
---
There is a noticeable lag on pet attack and follow, about .5 - 1 sec. I use Q and E for pet attack and follow and the lack of instant cast is killing me!
---
Pet pathing overall is terrible. My pet runs to a target, pivots around several times before attacking and often ends up behind the target. When targets run towards me my boar runs in a buggy zig zag pattern and often misses attacks. Looks kinda like a dog chasing its own tail while running back to me. I thought bestial swiftness would help but it hasn't.
---
Pets stay at dead targets for at least 1 second before returning or need to be manually recalled with follow.
---
Auto shot is sluggish and sometimes just fails.
---
Traps have a massive delay on being set. 
---
I can deal with bugs like the hunter's mark animation stuck on repeat, pulling out my quiver instead of a bow, and eyes of the beast not working right - those seem like easy fixes in time. What worries me though, is that all of these bugs have been around since beta in June and a week after launch the biggest problems remain. 
---
I hope patience will do the trick but how long? I don't want to level to 60 before they fix everything! I don't mean to sound like a bitch but I would've preferred blizz disabling hunters at launch or at least giving an warning about the core issues. Players are missing out on the real deal.
---
I'm literally on the same quest, 100% going to use this method tonight. Thanks stranger, saving me 20 minutes out of my day!
---
Weird, when I ran through Ashenvale during the shaman quest I met 5 Allies and 6 Horde people. And this was just while running through it. 10 Minutes maybe.
---
We are getting the influx of people who are like “I’ll wait for the first week rush to die to play”. Also Sulfuras has the best name so of course people are coming.
---
.... god damn I never made the connection. 
---
I knew it was somebody. But. 
---
Fuck I am dumb.
---
Ratchet to darkshore takes you on a cross continental tour.
---
As long as players choose to play on full servers when there are medium pop available, it's a player problem, not a server problem.
---
Exactly. Fuck em all. 
---
Dumbass
---
That makes WoW look like old RuneScape

He gets payed to play video games so he deserves to be hated...?
---
I never experienced a queue on Skeram - as I mentioned, we were off of work leveling so we were able to log in during the morning, well before any queue was noticed.  We are only noticing the queue now because time off is over.
---
You can transfer screenshots from pc to your phone to post them.
---
If you want to level up cooking, then leveling fishing along with it is by far the easiest way to do it. Leveling cooking without fishing can get expensive, and usually the case is that the AH doesn’t even have the mats you need. So you’re flying around to each zone to kill beasts to get the mats. And with fishing usually all you need is a fish and bam you can cook. With the meats you need like spices and sometimes a second meat just to cook
---
Same here , had way more difficulty doing Assault on Fenris island in the silverpine forest than completing RFC
---
Sorry that you couldn't take my criticism of telling you to live in your own ignorance but this is like talking to a child. You quote shit i don't say they go baby mode. Yeah, i am going to call you a fucking retard after you called me a fucko because that is exactly what you are, you escalate shit then get offended when the person talks back. The hypocrisy of you saying ad hominem is hilarious and leaves to this once again - Stay in your own world of ignorance you fucking retard because it is obvious you think your shit doesn't stink.
---
Look at that man in the top right corner without a gaming chair smh 🤦‍♂️
---
That was only yesterday... some days I dont even get in.
---
I put the chrome remote access app on my phone and downloaded it onto my PC. 
---
It basically allows me to hop in the queue while I’m at work and when I get home I’m in.
---
And quite the opposite, you just do not know what the hell you are talking about, so you cannot digest what I said.
---
You do realize where you are asking that right?
---
As of yet, the best estimate is “a few months”. I can’t imagine phase two lasting too long, as what it adds is minimal.  I would think before phase three they would try to make sure there is a healthy population of level 60s.
---
They haven't said how long the phases will be.
---
Oh definitely, be having so much fun on wow classic it’s unreal. I hope blizzard listens to the players about why we are all enjoying classic when there think about there next step with wow retail
---
Damn I went into that subreddit at aaa the first post of OP’s sister ripping up Stan Lee’s autograph and I’m filled with such despair for the title alone I couldn’t stay on that subreddit, had to back lol.
---
Classic and BfA share the same membership... If you pay one, you can play both, but you need to launch Classic through it's own program.  
---
I would suggest copying that error code and Googling it.  There are usually lots of suggestions for connection issues.
---
I think you need at least one mage for the kiting
---
The wrath expansion deleted a whole raid from the game and revamped it with all new gear.
---
Anything from naxxaramas (the last raid in vanilla) including the teir pieces got removed some notable loot is:
---
The corrupted ashbringer (a 2 handed sword that is the ultimate weapon to defeat undead and eventually delivers the final blow to the lich king.)
---
Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian the legendary staff from naxxaramus (it's the staff medivh from the the world of warcraft movie uses)
---
And as far as quests go if you are a fan of The legend zelda games there is a character that gives you a quest and at the end you can choose either "linkens sword of mastery" or "linkens boomerang" this quest was deleted shortly after vanilla.
---
that was pretty good :)
---
I'm perfectly fine with this addon, what I'm not fine with is the Gchat spam that follows.
---
Im lvl 13 and have 105 skinning but ive only made about 1g in skins, if that, not sure what im doing wrong lol!
---
And i shouldn't have to worry about mount, my main is a lock so ill get that basically-free mount
---
Thanks so much! Is the xp/hr accurate?
---
Then it's kind of a moot point, isn't it? 
---
You say it's about advertising, but my 22k queue to log into Herod tells me there's plenty of people already interested. This is perhaps one of the biggest launches in Blizzard history, I really don't think it needs more advertisement. Anybody who is curious has already tried, or has made a note to try (I've got friends waiting for queues to die down). 
---
If they don't play either offered iteration of WoW, and they haven't checked out the WoW tab already out of interest, then they won't even if there's a 2nd theoretical tab. They're already planning on playing, or they never were, so it's moot.

---
I’ve recently bound nearly everything to mouse buttons 4&amp;5, just standard 4&amp;5, alt, shift, ctrl 4&amp;5. I never really used keybinds back in the day, no idea how I managed to do anything.
---
I remember this from back when we were a raiding guild. People who were dicks with need rolling stuff they couldn't use or taking spawns and stuff would get noted in a list on the forums.  
---
More than once those people would then apply to raid with us.
---
How to toggle enemy buffs and hp?
---
Madseasonshow is great! He is currently playing classic and played during Vanilla and has some fantastic retrospective videos going over what it was like. He doesnt play warlock though.
---
Really? Every dungeon I've played until now we didn't do this... like at all. Granted I haven't been in many dungeons, but chainpulling and aoeing? Didn't see this yet. What I did see was the tank going wrongly into the enemies and getting raped in the span of 2 seconds, before my heal came through.
---
credit goes to u/RageTiger lol
---
A lot of the people that hit 60 first week had around 4 days /played. Which doesn't really require some superhuman feat of sitting and not sleeping.
---
"Upvote to sign" Make the karma work for you!
---
On the battle.net client, make sure to choose “classic”
---
Those aren't buffs, they're debuffs, which you can see by default. For HP I use Real Mob Health
---
Obviously someone who doesn't play a warrior. Charge is almost no threat. Rend is almost no threat. One thunderclap is a surprisingly small amount of threat.   
---
You want to charge in first, mainly because as first agro'er you'll be hit by the adds for additional rage. Thunderclap when you can. SUNDER for threat and damage. I will tab rend things, but getting a sunder or two off on the primary while t-clapping on CD is much more important. If I rend instead the rogues will always pull agro. One thunderclap won't hold threat on the adds very long... so use it multiple times to prevent healers from gaining threat. If you have a mage or warlock in the group you'll want to tab sunder as t-clap alone won't agro over Blizzard and DoTs.
---
It's pretty simple actually. It just requires your DPS not to go full retard by either running in first -- or attacking as you Bow pull back for LoS. Then the primary target should be good, and if you give it a few seconds, you should be able to Blizzard as well. But just AE'ing shit right on the pull will make everything run to you and me not care.
---
Fellow horde here: the anal spam is pretty cringe tbh. Ill take dwarven tinder any day over anal [rend].
---
You can use the original release schedule to ball park new phases, but remember blizzard does what it wants, and even if they did release a schedule they would deviate from it if they wanted to. 
---
Original release schedule can be viewed on the wiki.
---
It was customary for games and apps to keep everything in one folder back then. And it was really convenient when you could install the game on extrernal HD and never worry about losing your screenshots or addons if you switch PCs. I really hated when games started being "weird" and using my documents folder.
---
Now that it's faster to download the game from 0 and sync your folders than to read it from a HDD, I don't mind it anymore.
---
He laughs, saying "Lulz" without the caps, and "Iulz" responds questioningly.
---
I believe the reason why we all remember it as being super difficult is because we used to go into dungeons with level 18-21 mobs at level 15, whereas we now go in at level 17-22.
---
I believe the tab defaults to whichever you played last. I switch between Classic and Retail, noticed it sticks to whichever I played last. If you're hardcore one or the other, I can see maybe wanting to hide it, the same way I try to hide the Hearthstone tab lol
---
Roll. Somewhere. Else.
---
Haven't seen a queue all week and been playing every day.
---
I got it to work after closing out a firewall program and restarted my PC, seems to run flawless buying my membership now!! :D
---
Pagle?
---
That helped for sure, but the reason it looks better now is because people have more processing power for things like foliage, particle effects, and draw distance. You could already change this stuff in vanilla using commands its just that 99% of people couldn't run it.
---
Hmmm that is interesting. I will try to see if mine looks like a rewind scenario. Regardless, I submitted a ticket and a bug report.
---
Tell that to my 40+ hours played over the holiday weekend. Who wants to leave the house and socialize?
---
But why are they still there post warcraft 3?
---
Will do
---
NoggenPoggers, unite!
---
Holy shit. I only had to read this; but imagine what you deal with every day being with yourself. 
---
Everything ok fam?
---
Memoria
---
Funnily enough he’s probably the most comfortable.
---
Most people seem to still be below 20 on my server which makes the world seem empty in the upper 30s except stv always seems to be full
---
This is exactly what I’m doing and it’s very easy, even up to max level.  Healing instances while leveling is pretty trivial  as long as your group, particularly your tank, isn’t an idiot. 
---
Once you hit 40 you go full shadow and get shadowform, really increasing your DPS. 
---
Priest leveling really just requires spirit tap and wand spec, but shadow tree will make it easier.
---
Let us know I’d like to see what they say. I wouldn’t think something like that could even happen but who knows
---
i have noticed that it is fairly easy if you stick to green mobs and take it easy. The only annoying part is if your luck is shit like mine it can be a pain in the ass sometimes when you miss and get parried 3 times in a row then die :P
---
I did not know that, so all those bandits stealing the produce and building the dreadnaught were all working to sort the land and they were screwed over. Alliance is evil.
---
Oh damn didnt think of that cause I played a pala and proudly wore healing mail gear lol
---
Son of Arugal. If I had remembered those motherfuckers existed I would have taken my Undead straight to The Barrens after finishing Tirisfal.
---
Wand.
---
I know I want to play my shaman. But yes I also get the urge to create new characters. I want to create a warrior and a druid. But I also want to actually get past level 20. So I'm playing my Shaman until he reaches max level first. Then I maybe create another character.
---
Did you live though? 
---
also, how do you move the HP bar to be in the middle of the screen instead of corner?
---
Looks awesome!
---
We all do this. Its not stupid! Do whatever you like and enjoy it! :)
---
if you in enemy territory you always flagged...
---
I don't remember changing a setting for it, I thought it was by default
---
Holy cow I didn't get that far when I tried that expansion. I will have to look it up when I get home, that is brutal, they just mow the horde down like that? I think the alliance are most certainly bastards.
---
I came out to my parents as a gamer recently. They accepted me but I still think they have some resentment towards me.
---
I was pretty worried the community wouldn't return. I don't know what kind of black magic caused it to happen but the community is sure as hell back. Only a week in to classic and I've had far more enjoyable player interactions than the last 3 expansions combined. 
---
There's always buttholes out there, even back then. But they are back to being the minority which is how it should be. Even when you get one in your group the there are still another 3 members that will back you up.

I read this as

Meanwhile no one gave a fuck, but now they know you are a whinny bitch.

Awesome!! Super useful if you’re and herbalist
---
32! Started thursday night and played for like 14 hours a day or something
---
Also targets dead mobs. If you're in a questing area and looking for an alive mob, it can help.
---
So was that one event (Sylvanas becoming war chief) what caused the hordes downfall?
---
or mountain lions, drop the meat but not the blood, must be some dry ass meat
---
You can do both at 60. Cooking meat makes some decent money on the ah.
---
I have fully cleared Elwynn, Westfall, and Redridge for the Alliance. Loch Modan ad well. I'll clear duskwood, to strengthen Stormwind's position, then finish Wetlands. :D
---
Thanks man. and I am glad it helped other people as well
---
“Anyone who disagrees with my opinion isn’t a human being”
---
-You, 2019
---
My 2016 MBP fully decked out can handle my 4k video editing demands no problem but sounds like an actual airplane the moment I open retail.
---
Not sure about now, but in WOTLK days my buddy and I shared our accounts all the time. I logged onto his for his professions, he logged one mine for gathering, or we might switch for a bit just for lols. Never had any trouble.
---
The Horde quest is very similar to this Iirrc. I believe the horde throws bombs at alliance soldiers who are trying to form up.
---
Definitely gets tougher, but mine literally just stayed at 6,732xp the whole time. Part of me is hoping it’s all just a visual bug, but it’s happening with and without addons, which makes that feel unlikely.

Any tips for a solo player with a level 13 warrior trying to make it? Fairly new to WoW classic not sure that I should be dying to mobs as much as I am trying to farm these quests.
---
That’s not how it works. 
---
There’s different levels of full.
---
Yeah, Druid is swiss army knife up till later levels then I found I had to go all in for 1 class
---
Blizzard realized grown adults will pay 15 bucks a month for a 15 year old game they technically don't have to touch. 
---
I'd retcon my statement too
---
Yeah you end up doing circles around an area where everyone else is questing that has skins lol.
---
Going with friends or guildies helps a lot
---
Yeah, I’ll definitely let you know.
---
Nice dude. Did you guys mainly dungeon?
---
Depends on the server. Some are instant and others have a 3-4 hour queue at peak times.
---
How much were the mats in total?
---
Haha last night I posted "tank LFG RFC" and got an instant invite, they were all super happy they finally got a tank. Then I realised they were all level 25-35, and they quickly realised I was level 14 and I had said RFC, not RFK. They were all pretty gutted! Sounded like they'd been waiting for a tank for a while.
---
I just play to have fun ... Min maxing just ruins games
---
I gave a priest ptsd in a run of ragefire with some mates the other night.
---
My friends were running a 19 warrior, two 14 mages and myself on a 15 warlock. We invited some poor 11 priest on his first ever dungeon run.
---
The mages decided to tank as much of the dungeon as they could. The warrior didn't turn up until halfway through, then opted to pull as much as he thought he could take. I made an effort of life tapping down to 1hp. This poor priest was stressed out of his mind as we flailed off into the sunset never giving him a chance to drink.
---
Thankfully our mage decided to give the priest a break by telling him not to heal me as I'd be fine. The run then became who can get the warlock killed first as the priest took this to heart and damned if I was going to stop life tapping.
---
It turns out I won the challenge initiating our one and only wipe by swandiving off a cliff I didn't notice and having my imp pull the entire dungeon.
---
10/10 will dungeon again.
---
Sounded vaguely Spongebobby
---
I see what you’re saying a little bit man. I ask for groups all the time in zones with questing items to make things go faster. And obviously people group up to get a certain npc or something and then mostly leave right after. But I don’t think that makes them antisocial. I do see your point though. 
---
I think instances are a good way to find some good people!
---
This is my first time playing wow and it's really not all that fun for this reason. I'm level 19 and I've already noticed that Westfall has more or less completely cleared out and I can't find any groups for deadmines anymore. Seems like most everyone has played the game in the past and are just rushing through it as fast as possible.
---
No, you don't and shouldn't be protection. You will be horrible while solo. Arms tanks dungeons well, fury tanks them adequately. 
---
No, protection is useless in pvp without being hopelessly overgeared.
---
And 3 second later they slaughter entire human village to collect their ears. 
---
Pat your ally, slay the alli
---
Epic gamer moment
---
Anything with +Intelligence on it.  
---
You just need to have enough mana to get through a fight.  If your main spec is another caster spec, you can just use that gear.  But if your something like a feral druid or ret pally, you’re main gear probably won’t have any INT on it.
---
Weed? In my city going from north to south kali takes just as long as the coke dealer would take to get you a gram at home lol. Thought we grew up from the weed by now.
---
I really like healing to be honest though.
---
you can arms / fury tank up till like 50s always good to have a sword and board to put on. Prot is good for AV
---
Stan
---
I will, thanks. Can I give my 1g from my human to my nelf to buy stuff or is gold tied to character?
---
When youre leveling in war mode no one tries to kill you because theyre leveling too
---
That's not really the point of what I'm saying.  The point is that people need to glorify their present day accomplishments because many of them didn't even play vanilla so they want to downplay what it was.
---
Vanilla was not rocket science, but it's absurd that people playing a much easier version of the game use their accomplishments in that version to try and discredit what vanilla was.
---
No joke lol I got the creeper ichor on my third spider and I only have 3 tongues after 15-20 bears
---
Who is Stan
---
Fuck off.
---
You sound so dumb.
---
This is probably the most ironic post I'll ever see here.
---
I'm dropping skinning now as well. I can make so much more money doing other stuff.
---
Any census data on A:H ratio?
---
It ruins the sense of exploration because you can see its there on the map.
---
Make Azeroth Great Again
---
Perhaps I should take skinning/herb or mining/skinning just to sell stuff. I don't really plan on making anything for myself since I just get most gear from drops..
---
Is there any other way to get arrows?
---
Essentially as accurate as google maps is at predicting your ETA.  It works with as much info as possible to predict accurately, then adjusts as you go, so obviously it will be more accurate the closer you are to leveling.
---
Nah, you can send across characters. 1hour send time though.
---
GLHF!
---
Wool bags are 8 slot.
---
What are you thinking up picking up instead?? I might keep it until i hit 20
---
Some people don't want that sense of exploration.
---
We all have queues on the brain right now so I would cut him some slack.
---
It's also why I think Varian's return and subsequent progression as a character was handled pretty decently for an MMO.
---
Warlords shit the bed, but the end of MoP was really impactful on my younger self. That was the point where I figured peace was genuinely an option.
---
Though, in general, you're still not wrong. The Alliance is a lot more gray in Classic. I don't even know why, because they're not supposed to be this xenophobic. I can really only point to the wars for the change. They used to live side-by-side with the High Elves, after all.
---
Thunderbluff still evokes awe in me. I would love an updated version of Mulgore and TB with modern WoW graphics, but I understand that’s not all that popular around here,
---
They want you looking at BFA all the time.
---
Intellect adds 15 Mana and very small amount of crit chance.
---
Spirit Regen is very very shitty unless it's boosted by talents (play priest) or by maybe Mage Armor (lvl 30s) but that's still lack luster. Best use of spirit is having a separate set of gear to switch to while you drink.
---
Spell power is great if you can stack it. It boosts spells like Fireball (direct dmg) the best and Frostbolt pretty good (dmg + slow means it takes a spellcoefficient penalty). Remember +spell dmg does jack shit for Blizzard (terrible spell coefficient) so if you're Aoe leveling Intellect is vastly superior (+15 to Mana adds up to more Blizzard casts).
---
TLDR. Single target take +spell power and stack it a lot. Aoe leveling take Intellect and spirit for sure.
---
That shit was gold
---
if he does that 37038 more times, then he can afford a epic mount + skill
---
Yep Prat was doing this for me as well in both retail and classic.
---
Basically anytime text would appear it would drop a frame, but only from certain things, like looting, or in the case for retail inside BGs.
---
Removed it as it's be dropping frames for months.
---
Thanks you too
---
You're welcome!
---
For many years now, there have been homebrew servers running older versions of the game. These are sometimes called pirate servers but are usually called private servers. They have almost all been free to play. 
---
The free private servers running old versions of the game stood in contrast to the current version of the game that you paid to play. Ergo, retail. It's the version of the game you can get at retail.
---
I just want it in the right click menu of the tray icon. About a dozen times, I right clicked there to play classic only to realize retail is loading.
---
Part of the reason I can’t stand to play without class colors in chat.
---
get rekt boomer
---
Depends on the zone. Arathi Highland looks a lot better with the shrubbery.
---
You're a real successful breadwinner. Congrats.
---
If you're alliance, you're always flagged in horde territory. The horde can still keep it off because they're in their own territory.
---
I had a tauren druid body camp me but in the most frustrating way. He was 2 levels higher and the mobs were already 2 levels higher in STV. He only came after me once I engaged a mob. I signed up for this, well played.
---
What did he do?
---
Sure about the neutral/contested zones part? I was in ashenvale, horde were not attackable.
---
Is this how anti-aliasing works?
---
Classic is not free. It does not come with a retail sub. You buy a WoW sub, you get to play retail or classic. Stop twisting words.
---
Here's a good guide for classic mages.

---
"Hey guys what's up Madseason here back with another video for you"
---
x10
---
There are a few big downsides to that idea:
---
1.  It's a dead-end.  They release new BC servers (and presumably allow a one-time transfer).  Then later do the same with WotLK.  Then what?  Probably a new game that looks more like Cata than like Vanilla.
---
2.  Releasing additional expansions either deletes what we have or splits the playerbase.  This is less of an issue, but still a big deal.  I'm sure they wouldn't just replace Classic Vanilla with Classic BC, but that means new servers for BC and probably for WotLK, leaving Classic Vanilla with not a lot going on.
---
3.  There *were* things in both of those expansions that could be brought more in-line with Vanilla philosophy.  Do you really want the game after Classic Vanilla to have flying (that eliminates world PvP)?  Do you want it to have the high-level zones be completely separate and isolated from the leveling zones?  Do you want WotLK's dungeon finder?
---
Right now, people who worked on the original Vanilla game are still working at and/or advising Blizzard on how they created Classic.  They won't be there forever.  And right now is when the lesson of Classic's popularity has actually been learned... eventually that lesson will be forgotten again.
---
Now is the perfect and perhaps only time to create new expansions that retain Vanilla's design philosophy while also learning from the mistakes made in existing expansions.
---
I use one called threatplates that shows their health and threat information
---
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Me smash Rawrxx!
---
He called them dungeons not instance dungeons though.
---
Yep places like these are the best.
---
Nice!
---
That might be it 🙂
---
Yea they asked for a game to promote community to only hold themselves up in dungeons over and over like as if they were queuing for heroic/mythic dungeons over and over instead of all the other things they advocated for in classic.
---
As far as I'm concerned it has its own tab, and retail doesn't exist anymore.
---
What? It literally says on the tin it requires a retail WoW sub to play, ergo it's free tacked onto the regular subscription.
---
Yesss, how good is the community ! I love it
---
im playing with a friend who is new, we got up to discover rolf's fate and he isnt able to get the quest. i tried sharing it with him but it says hes ineligible. is there something he might have forgotten to do?
---
The mob might have shadow resistance or some sort of damage resistance.
---
It'll definitely be longer than 2 months :P... Blizzard milks things for as long as possible.
---
By attacking them.
---
Mobs dont have a reset range in vanilla as long as you attack them, they will follow you.
---
I remember Dire Maul’s tribute chest needing at least one item in it so that 40 man raids can alternate through the instance and buffing without it despawning.
---
are you dense?
---
I'm currently flying to Darnassus from Ratchet and it's been a wild trip so far. Took me further south, then west, then northish. It's been over 12 minutes and I'm still in flight.
---
Does anyone know if Hand of Justice from BRD can proc for feral druids in cat/bear form? I know weapons with chance-on-hit effects can't but since HoJ is a trinket I'm not so sure.
---
That’s actually a very reachable area
---
What's your UI add-on? (The dark borders and stuff)
---
Sadly they'd get more karma for a good picture.
---
I have a 1 hour+ commute and work 9 hour days.. can confirm that some days i have some time to play after work.
---
But after adult responsibilities and cooking/cleaning and getting ready for my next day, it's not easy to sit down for more than an hour and play. And at that point, its easy to convince yourself to just watch tv for an hour because an hour of playtime is just a tease. 
---
Sorry, just me venting after recently graduating and getting a full time job a hour away.
---
40 mount is absolutely free. Not even a quest (other than accepting the mount)
---
This is what is wrong with him the rage mob that follow him that behave like he is some kind of prophet that knows it all.
---
1.3 made it BoP so it should be BoP since the data is 1.12
---
Except delves are shit-easy. I think they'd be fun if you actually had to hit more than one button to complete them.
---
You replied as if you were the original guy who did indeed defend abuse of layering.
---
If you hijack a comment like that you gotta expect people to not notice you being someone else.
---
I'm in the same exact boat as you regarding wanting a rogue, except I'm a Mage and not a Hunter. And I had the exact same question you did regarding the last part of your post. And nobody has answered it yet :( commenting here in case someone does so I can check back. I would love to do dungeons and all while occasionally doing some world pvp, but switching specs each time doesn't sound like a good idea.
---
Yeah I never understood the switch to games being in my documents.
---
I have a games folder for a reason.  My documents is for the not fun shit I have to do on the computer.
---
Idk you whining harder than OP...
---
Yeah if you look under what I entered in, 'World of Warcraft' it says 'Online Game', rather than just 'search result'. Google collects and represents all data around the game 'World of Warcraft' and presents it in the graph
---
Really? I saw it raining in the wetlands on the first stress test, perhaps it has changed since. I'm horde but I'll have to go check it out when I can, thanks for the correction!
---
I feel you... We reserved our name.. we took the less populated server at the time.... Skeram... We managed to have a group of 20 friends playing on the same server... Half of them are stuck in queue most of the time... People who invested a lot of time don't want to switch... People who can't get in when they want are frustrated...
---
It starting to put a split in our group... Blizzard sure has a responsibility to do some thing IMO.
---
Give us server transfer already!!!!
---
most do xmog for themselves more than doing it for others
---
How are you so far zoomed out?
---
Yassss, you legend!
---
Is your wand skill maxed?  You may need to skill up if you haven’t been wanting all along.
---
Were you around during the week between vanilla and TBC? I remember my guild petitioning a GM to get a Paladin T2 helm from onyxia turned to a Shaman T2 helm, because they updated the loot tables before paladins were officially on horde. That was brutal. 
---
The GM did not give us the Shaman helm.
---
That really depends on the level range of the group, I would say if you're all 15 it's going to be a challenge, if you're all 25 it'll be a breeze.
---
If you're 15 and the rest of the group is 25, you'll probably be fine as they'll carry you. If you're 25 and they're 15 you might be able to help them pull through.
---
That is your opinion, but what you feel ruins games brings others great joy. That is why you are free to create or join whatever type environment suits your play style. 
---
I personally enjoy playing at a fairly high level while voice chatting with the guildies I am running with.
---
Now add in pirates of the Caribbean theme with captain Jack sparrow letting out a "ah" at the start, post that shit on YouTube.
---
Don't join a full server then
---
Switching through Azshara at lv 25? Its a level 50+ zone.
---
Have not looked that up, how many is it in classic? 
---
But I bet you are going to have a busy schedule ☺️
---
But what you did is a really smart tip, grind for something you want while you are leveling.
---
Yeah I'm maxed.
---
Clearly your friend isn't hip to selling all their unneeded loot on the AH for a small fraction more than what they would have gotten if they just vendored it in the first place.
---
 I'm just messing around though. Hope ya'll are enjoying Classic together!
---
Same shit. So the horse quest The Den is considered a dungeon my your terms? Nah pass.
---
Ran in to the Son of Arugal this afternoon, twice.
---
Ah thanks, should have been obvious enough haha, played since release but always thought they just have a max range from their original pull spot 😄
---
Agreed. The improvement in quality from old zones like silverpine forest vs somewhere in kul'tiras is stark. The old content looks like shit when compared to anything Cata or later.
---
You'd still have to run the full dungeon with all that gear damage though.
---
get GOT ha!
---
If there’s no ganking is it even classic.
---
How did that party work? 2 groups of dps, tank, healz?
---
Wand skill doesn't affect damage, just how often you hit.
---
No, I don't, and no, I didn't. I responded with a comment with a completely different main takeaway.
---
And it's not my job to ensure people read usernames. Participating in a comment thread is also not hijacking a comment.
---
You never really need to "grind mobs" unless you really don't want to pick up quests in a new zone.
---
If you find windows of lul where you've done all the quests you can, you can always turn to dungeons to make up the difference.
---
Maybe, I'll need to test on diff mobs
---
Haha, how in the hell did you come to that conclusion, Sherlock?
---
Nah. Honestly I blame ActiBlizz. With layering there is no reason why there should be a server limit. We are talking about a game that ran on some pretty primitive servers. Today there is no excuse why they can't uncap server pop with the technology that is used today.
---
I was questing in Westfall, heading to Moonbrooke to kill the defias messager when I see two people just fishing in the pond on the way there. So I joined them and started fishing, just chatting. It was quite a nice experience.
---
Damn feels bad why play an mmorpg at that point where the focus of the game is the world. Because it sure as hell isnt us.
---
Oh cool so a few times a day for Arugal then.

Why is everyone here like "delete this". As if it is a secret. I've seen this posted since 4 days already.
---
Is this an add on?
---
it recommends a priest even when i select human/dwarf and put pvp and pvp-healing at the top, followed by soloing, removing everything else
---
i think it should say paladin, priests are too fragile in classic pvp (which is what made me reroll having basically played only priests since BC)
---
Thanks. I'll look it up :)
---
Are mods asleep or something? What an absolute shit post. They are LITERALLY the same game, different expansions, but they shouldn’t be associated????
---
*Yawgmoth would like to know your location.*
---
What an obscure reference.... nerd.
---
But they do have a high likelihood to cause /cringe.
---
You'll get a lead in to hillsbrad. Classic does not have enough quests to not have grinding unless you complete zones at level. I'd suggest doing multiple zones if you don't want grind. So far I did tirisfal-rfc quests and rfc-silverpine-wc quest and WC, silverpine finish-got to tarren mill- left to stonetalon- finished stonetalon- back to hillsbrad- hard elite quests so I'm going to ashenvale for a bit and I'll come back.
---
I have been using [this](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=druid&amp;t=z_z.z~z-AaAgAhAiAjAkAxIAAdAeAfAlAmArAsAtzBAuAvAwzCAyAzAAABIB) for leveling. After 39 it's more about do you want to tank, dps or heal.
---
I actually bought my first lvl40 alliance mount from gold selling 'tours' to the flightpath scenery in Menethil, the Ironforge airfield and Old Ironforge
---
thanks much appreciated!
---
Did you try a double x at the beginning and end?
---
You'll have to download an add on. I can't remember which one I have for it. Laying in bed
---
trying to decide what to invest time in.
---
I have a human mage and undead warlock both at level 14. I love them both, but i'm getting tired of grinding and swapping back and forth and not retaining progress between them so I want to just spend all my time on 1. 
---
I like mage a lot and i love the feel of it and i like being a human a bit more but the ability to solo tough content and have things tank for me is really great on warlock and almost entirely outweighs that alone. Warlock also gets a "free" mount eventually i know, but the prospect of making portals as a mage is super appealing to me. 
---
However, i'm starting to get sick of generic dark spooky forest zones \[went through all of tirisfall and now is in silver pines\] and would rather be exploring fun, more populated colorful environments like goldshire or something. 
---
Which one should i go for? and what zones do you recommend for my taste?
---
This doesnt seem to really show what FR gear the tank does or doesn't have, but yea.
---
Am a rogue and already did this once and it felt so right. I was in Redridge, at the far east side of the zone where there are murlocs, kinda close to the azora lion statue (most people kill the murlocs closer to town for the quests). I began to meticulously clear them all since they had a chest in the middle.
---
Lo and behold someone running by decided to take the chest right as I was finishing off the last small group. Clearly didn't realize they were doing me a favor as I quickly vanished and easily looted the chest as they ran away with a pack of murlocs chomping at them.

Free cloud storage isn't exactly in the same ballpark as most bloatware

Is there any way to set shamans to blue instead of pink?
---
Rattlegore seems great so far on horde side
---
As a warrior you want to be equal or above the quest level, you want it to go smoothly not "struggle for a bit more xp".
---
Otherwise you're going to have to hamstring and kite a lot.
---
This was actually just image I found from Google. Was waiting in queue and ended up this idea.

Was this guy named Asmongold?

nothing wrong with a lil hypocrisy m8. you shouldn't take yourself too seriously

“That mans the best pirate I’ve ever seen...”

If wanting my subreddits (and any online image websites) in 2019 not to have terrible image quality for no reason other than the poster being lazy is being a pedantic jerk than I absolutely am one.

I saw the title too, it's a good title and a wholesome situation, for a lot of us that's absolutely ruined when I can count the number of pixels in the photo that was supposed to be of this great moment.

You wouldn't capture a family picture with a flip phone in 2019, you shouldn't cap a great screen moment on a picture of a monitor in 2019 either.
---
But I mean, why not just take the random name then?
---
Can confirm. I’m level 33 on my druid. I have 35 gold, spent 10 gold on my guilds tabard design, and roughly 24 gold on all my skills from trainer.
---
I horde and sell ALOT of junk.
---
Yeah but all of my friends are here. I'm playing this game for my friends and the social reasons, not for the game itself. I was able to play ~16ish hours which are hard for me to find. I shouldn't have to plan when I'm going to have a few free hours to play ya know? It's absurd.
---
Warrior is the most difficult to level as others have said so in general you want to be overleveled for the zone you are in. Might be a little too late now but when ur in westfall u can also go start other teen zones for the other races.
---
FELLING APPLE KEYBOARD ON A WINDOWS BOX GAMERS, I FOUND YOU. SO COMFORTABLE.

Hey, I ran Gnomeregan with Skarlett this weekend!
---
Hydraxian Waterlords represent!
---
&gt;Another A1243 keyboard user, BFF
---
Best keyboard EVER made. I bought a few from Staples before they quit making them for future gaming PC builds.
---
Also:
---
Can I just take the linen cloth I'm getting off all these Defias corpses and buy some red dye or use their blood to make red bandanas?
---
Do I really want to know what's in Westfall soup?
---
Why do Gnolls wear armbands?  But only some of them?  Are they special Gnolls who belong to a political arm?
---
Side note... At the moment, just level 12 (Rogue), all of the armor she's wearing except the chest piece is something she made.  It's kind of nice making use of trade skills again.  The chest piece is a quest reward, I believe from killing Hogger, which took some time.  But bracers, gloves, belt, legs, boots, cape all Leatherworking.  Helps to see all the corpses left behind by other folks.  I just grab the leather and make the bodies vanish... like a Corpse Disposal Crew!
---
But seriously... that gnoll question...  Grouped up with someone, they got all theirs, I logged out at 5/8 because I didn't want to go all night.  That shirt didn't start red, it's red with the blood of the Gnollpocalypse.
---
We don't know if the world will exist tomorrow, we just have to take our best guess
---
RIP, MC Down in 5 days LOL.
---
Just to clarify this is not my in game build. I just got image from Google when I was on queue and got idea to create this while we talked with my friends how I always need roll for offspec item (they say that about every item I roll)
---
I was feeling he same way 32 lock, I started a mage yesterday that I’m playing on the side leveling to change up the grind and it’s nice cause I have tailoring on my lock so I just made myself greens and bags to start with and sent some good and speed running my alt in comparison to the lock, also the starting zones have very little competition for mobs now too! I saw play an alt on the side to not get burned out on one toon.
---
Right click the tab you're looking at and click settings, then go to the tab in question and enable "skill ups" and "system messages" and all that.
---
Don't need an add-on to move Heath bars, right click and unlock the bars
---
I didn't say that is what they actually look like, I'm sure some of them have jobs and families like everyone else. But you don't  need to be a data scientist to know that going from 1-60 and clearing MC in the first week of classic's release would have required these guys to either sleep very little or take a week off from work and spend nearly every waking hour leveling/grinding.
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one. I’m finally sticking with my rogue but I have 3 other toons at around rank 10 haha
---
RIP!
---
That's fine and all, but I didn't sign up for a WoW classic sub after not playing for ~8 years to play by myself.
---
&gt;Damn feels bad why play an mmorpg at that point where the focus of the game is the world.
---
Because the game offers tons of other things without being in the open world. Such as doing dungeons and raids together. I know it's hard for you to grasp the fact that people enjoy different aspects of MMOs/games, especially when you've done it all multiple times over the years, but at least try.
---
Most of these guys will stop playing classic because they'll have nothing to do. Dont let them ruin your experience, progress at your own pace.
---
So does grinding thousands of humanoids
---
Hey monster, maybe you'd like to look into our guils, &lt;Sane&gt;. It's a small guild, about 40 people, mostly adults with kids and work. 
---
We're pretty set in knowing we won't be doing amy world firsts but are happy to just play and adventure together to hopefully raid one day.
---
Our discord is: https://discord.gg/CWhf2UM
---
Feel free to look us up. Ler me know if you have any questions!
---
Moonmoons pov: https://clips.twitch.tv/StrangeSoftChinchillaUncleNox
---
This is solid advice. Do not do every single quest.
---
Also don’t forget about the rep questing gives you.  When you reach honored you get a 10% discount on all vendors of that faction.  This can save you 10g on your mount.  I mix grinding and questing in order to not die of boredom.
---
Are you me?
---
Yeah. And for me it wouldn't be about postage but actually loosing control of my item for couple of hours. What if it was piece of gear I want to sell? Now I have to wait couple hours until I finally get it back and can start selling again.
---
The memories :D Love seeing this!

Whoever made this is my new hero LOL
---
"I'm a purist and want WoW classic to be like the original WoW classic..." 
---
Ftfy
---
That sounds like retail would be a better cup for you. 
---
The quests are half the game IMO
---
I spent more time than I care to admit watching low level 20s run up the road and get pwned.
---
I’ve started over every time a new friend joined us. I think I have 3-4 alts now.
---
Cool, I rolled on one of the new day one servers and get queues every day since!
---
Haha at least you have great spot :D
---
I'd recommend Affliction...stay in the Aff tree.  DoTs are what locks are known for in WoW (both Vanilla and Classic). I tend to cast Curse of Agony to pull/tag the mob and then I immediately send my VW to tank. Next is Immolate and Corruption followed by SBs or wand. Drain soul as needed. Rinse and repeat. This is what works for me Currently, I'm lvl 15 so rotation will change. Not sure of your level, so not sure what you have at your disposal. Hope it helps!
---
Did you guys fuck?
---
Yes dump em way out past fatigue swim zone
---
I'm looking to play with folks I know IRL.  Not opposed to meeting new people, but I know I'm not alone in leveraging WoW classic as a good way to reconnect with old IRL friends.
---
Just started doing this at 36. I was de'ing them for enchanting but like, I can sell two greens and get a whole gold.
---
To be fair their is a metric ton of human npcs, "heroes" are less common, eg in wc3 you get the 1 hero and a bunch of units to support them,
---
Bravely we invaded the westfall, slay 2-3 alliance warriors and went to the Deadmines :D
---
And you got a window seat!
---
How much time does that take? I spend maybe 20 minutes a day on average cooking and grocery shopping. Less on cleaning.
---
I get if someone has kids, but adults don't make much of a mess.
---
where's the karma shop?! i want a new irl mount now
---
I mained a hunter in vanilla, but 12 years ago was a long goddamn time. I too had this question earlier today when I noticed my boar didn't have growl.
---
I felt like a moron when I found that I had been looking at the tab all this time.
---
Iamnotasmartman.jpg
---
“Swoosh, rawr, bink” 😂
---
Good job reconnecting in the queue screen. You were told over a week before launch there would be a wait.
---
Heroic Arcatraz was the best 5 man dungeon of all time, come at me.
---
What website or other means can you tell server/world firsts?  Or thirds?
---
😂🤣😭
---
I mean you care enough to reply to reinforce your own opinion. So I think you care quite a bit.
---
"Sense of exploration" in a game that's 15 years old. I love "exploring" the Barrens for 10+ levels.
---
Stupid question, what is that addon called top of ur screen?
---
I usually ask the healer how they feel
---
what do people mean when they say "inv 4 layer"? I understand what it is but what are they doing exactly.
---
Thexa
---
Level 1 and 2 growl are given after the hunter quest. Level 3 and higher must be bought from let trainers.
---
Well there was a 3 hour gap between the post and the question so...
---
Kinda lame since there's a huge advantage from hitting 60 early. I've seen multiple streams where players are farming devilsaur leather uncontested. Also swapping layers which gives them even more. Crazy.
---
Just turn your graphics to max everything if your rig can handle it.
---
Why would retail be better? It's not like you grind mobs for hours on end on retail...  Grinding is apart of Classic WoW, even if you do all the quests you still need to grind.
---
Do you happen to live in portland oregon?
---
For what it's worth, there's nothing stopping you from jumping your undead over to the other continent for a change of scenery.
---
That's awesome glad to see someone from Blaumeux hope to play with you soon :D and thanks
---
This is the real answer, I played for 2 hours today while my girlfriend was im the living room and i felt guilty! 
---
Tomorrow she works and has classes all day, and I have the day off, so I should get some guilt free time! Hoping to get to level 16 and do a DM run
---
Growl rank 1&amp;2 the pet trainer does not offer. You learn the skill during your pet acquisition quest.
---
*Looks nervously at Undead priest named Karen*
---
Haha yeah..
---
Then that's when they'll xfer people, or merge servers. No use using working manhours on a dead server. If the PM for classic didn't suck, then they would of had that planned out.
---
Wait, how did he 'bring thousands of people in to help make sure classic was a success' did he hire a bunch of old devs to come and work on the game or something?
---
i know, and i want to see buffs, does that addon include it?
---
/petattack
---
Is asshole* "nah you guys are the asshole for calling me out! I'm right not you!" Big sad man.
---
Yeah.. let me just reroll on a medium server and forget about the level 40 rogue I have
---
In classic melee and casters play fundamentally differently with regards to AOE / burst, so generally speaking when you want to do fast AOE clearing, you should stack either casters, or melee, and not mix the two.
---
Spellcasters generally can CC a lot better, and thus can pull LARGE groups of mobs, and AOE them with efficiency, but they also incur downtime in between pulls with drinking, rebuffs etc.
---
Melee are far better at sustained chain pulling but they deal with less at a time, and they obviously do better with melee enemies where they can get everything in literal cleave range.
---
Spell cleave is the group of casters who AOE a dungeon/instance/area quickly by spamming CC and AOE damage, in a group.
---
I made my own version of a grudge book by using some note taking stuffs.
---
I know there is a grudge book addon but the person who posted an image of it is a fucking jackass who refuses to share the addon and just says "our guild made it and it's great!" good for fucking you, horde a really cool RP addon you shitters.
---
Stv looks great as well.
---
no you said that you can play however you want, so im telling you to try and play like him
---
I know... I really felt like I should have know this and I really did some research. All of these "quirks" are reminding me why it was so "fun" back in the day lol. I'm still having fun though.
---
Meh, Steam Link is way easier. Even outside the house.
---
And of course I didn't even try that because everyone said it doesn't work in Vanilla...
---
How are you connected to the internet? Phone hotspot?
---
It was most likely a weakaura, I'm using this one:
---
https://wago.io/ClassicBudsUI
---
&gt; Little interactions with other players.
---
The only part I'm missing. Maybe there's just a huge difference between roleplay servers and normal servers, but the lack of interaction is the only point I'm a little bit disappointed with. Back in the day (tm), there was always something to observe. Now everyone seems to play silently, people even barely answer.
---
Not really. I could do it with flametongue and a crit.
---
Those chests are good for mats and that's about it I believe. Maybe the 30+ zone chests have the gear?
---
They probably did it to control the market. Happens all the time.
---
that's true, but i'm not sure about the specifcs. i'm on a pve server. aren't some zones alliance only/horde only? or is that only in pvp servers? i'd love to go to goldshire as my undead but i have a strong, strong feeling the reason i never saw any horde there is because they aren't allowed :P
---
Was a locked chest too. Rogue opened it and I won the /roll which^I^Think^every^group^universally^agree^on
---
Didn’t realize I wanted this until I saw. That’s....*unreal*
---
I see a lot of junk food. You better have had a good supply of water to stay hydrated.
---
Not to get too involved, but I'm 99% sure you're wrong about drain life. It definitely heals the warlock and provides Mana return w lifetap (aka gives more health back than costs in Mana)
---
Nope. Wrote it out myself.
---
Titan UI. :)
---
yikes
---
I was doing the “Investigate the blue recluse” quest today. Some nerd took my boxes after i spawned, killed, and boxed the npc. He did this twice. I was fuming.
---
I also remember this.
---
It will tho, esp if you crit and have a decent weapon...
---
Apes are peices of shit right from nost and ND. You think later abusing is bad? Wait until they start the devilsaur leather camping
---
Just use flametongue... It's like. 2-4 DPS loss at low levels.
---
Had that yesterday as Warrior, by any chance Skits?
---
How do I literally start alchemy? I trained myself but can't find the minor potion recipe? When I press "K" I can see my levels but that's it.
---
Mage is considerably stronger at 60 in current content, and continues to out-do warlocks until pretty late in the game so if raw DPS appeals to you that's something to consider. Both have very sought after utility in the form of portals/food/sheeps and summons/healthstones/soulstones, so it's pretty even there I'd say.
---
 As far as zones go you'll be getting into hillsbrad in a few more levels as an undead which brightens up a bit, and eventually you can get into like arathi and maybe stonetalon which are both pretty scenic. On the other hand you're inevitably gonna end up in spooky-town on your human for quite a while once you get into Duskwood levels.
---
I legit saw a guy with the name "Moo"
---
Man you know how many people I've ran into crying over a lost roll? If they have the opportunity to ninja they are going to to get their justice.
---
lol k
---
That's the motto
---
Not my proudest fap
---
You're making a simple thing complicated there bud. Let's say I want to play Classic WoW today, can I play it for free? No. Therefore, the game is not free.
---
I’m playing wow for the first time ever as a mage. My hypothetical future tanks want to thank you. In all seriousness though thank you this was actually a really clear and relatively concise explanation.
---
The tank has to build up threat by doing damage to the target. If you unload you have a chance of doing far more threat far faster than the tank, and pulling aggro.
---
No, OP is a total shitbag and thinks it's funny (hence posting it on here). As a capped auction house goblin in BfA, I never COD because people do this all the time to let it expire and cause market inflation.
---
Yeah, you'll die in Goldshire, but only the lower level zones are like that and you can quest in the orc/tauren/troll areas just fine.
---
Til
---
I never do. But now I'm going to
---
it's under the objects tab at the bottom of the screen. It's got sections for multiple types of thing, and veins, like chests, are "objects", rather than "items". You mine the item, copper ore, from the object, copper vein.
---
Looks like the edit serves you well
---
Damn bro that sucks..
---
Ah yes .... Hybrid warrior
---
Wherever theres an inn
---
I don’t get it.
---
Every innkeeper for your faction will bind you to their location.
---
That’s huge man. Congrats!
---
The problem with the “what they do in pvp doesn’t matter” is that a lot of people raid exclusively for gear to pvp with. 
---
For example (while not classic) the illadin bow was extremely important for hunters in tbc because they had to run mana drain comps.
---
I haven’t looked up the endgame gear for pve/pvp in classic but I’m sure there will be some pieces I want/need from raids. Meanwhile I’m not overly concerned about doing ony or naxx again, I did them both in wrath (incl all achievements 25man naxx runs). But this way I contribute an experienced tank/healer/dps to the raid/guild.
---
I envy you
---
Yeah, if it’s number 3 quest of a quest line of 6 quests, then you can’t share unless the other character is at the same sequence of the quest line.
---
I love this
---
The supremacy of the big slow weapon is half a myth anyways man. Yes you want slow weapons but nothing slower than 3.30 all abilities scale to that weapon speed except white damage auto attack damage.
---
Thise 4.00 weapons are a waste of dps
---
That's gonna be a big yikes from me big guy. Your joke isn't funny and continuing it like this just makes you look retarded.
---
If I wanted to utilize rtx technology I won’t be playing classic wow lmao.
---
The recipe can be purchased from a vendor in the rogues Castle, ravenholdt in hillsbrad, behind durnholde keep. 
---
Anyone should be able to go up and get it but I've never tested if the npcs are hostile to non rogues.
---
Yup. The dreaded death march. Can always try cutting west from Western Plaguelands, but that is all 50+ also. Horse a piece.
---
Weird way to say you regrowth yourself between pulls.  Or are you that other tank class that sucks? 
---
:P
---
Why is wool so dang expensive? also, where is the best place to 'farm' wool near stormwind area? I'm level 18 if that helps.
---
I used Frost Nova on him. Frost Nova resets aggro I have on a mob, I did that to make him fight other people and guards. So yeah I suppose eventually someone else got the tag. I didn't really care about that because I already killed Stitches once before and got the femur he drops.
---
Appreciate it! It's time for a long sleep and back to work tomorrow.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/search?q=innkeeper all of these people are hearthstone locations.
---
Um the inn. You set your one and ONLY hearth stone at any inn.its an hour cooldown.
---
not yet but it will be soon.
---
It would be faster to quest if it’s taking you two hours per level? Sheesh.
---
It is hard with WoW especially as an hour of game time really isn't that much progress. I just did it right now though lol.. spent all day working on my jetski up at the brother in laws and got home with enough time for an hour then shower and straight to bed. It was worth it because i needed my fix.
---
Lies, you opened with earth shock and you know it.
---
I just explained you why they aren't .  I have no time to go in more detail, I have my morning AH check to perform and the it's off to work.
---
Fuck taxes. Thrall hasn't even paved the roads in the Barrens in decades. And the water pipes? They literally have people running in them! Completely rip off by the government.
---
I don't even want to know what you consider cooking that it takes you 15 mins.
---
You grind to make certain things easier on yourself in classic, not out of necessity
---
its a holdover from private servers where retail = purchased since most pserver players didnt have an active sub
---
Thank you.
---
It does not. For that you want the addon ClassicAuraDurations.
---
I think the important part is how they are similar. Difficulty of things in eso is another topic. I hit 160cp and quit playing after picking it up during the holidays last year.
---
I figured.  So you don’t really know.
---
Thanks, didnt know
---
Ok, at level 20 it's a quest or a few mobs instead, or 1/5 of a green item
---
tyty!!
---
After I left a group today, the lvl 23 holy priest was talking shit about me, a lvl 22 warrior, having minor difficulty holding aggro against a lvl 26 rogue in SFK. People are idiots.
---
You can do Ashenvale as well but if you’re on a pvp server you may be ganked a lot. Just think of it as a warmup for STV later
---
My solution was to roll a tank. I feel they’re the natural leaders in a dungeon  group so you can kind of take control.
---
If you're worried about being relevant in late-game PvE content, then roll another class.
---
This is what it should look like to other players when Taurens speak in Taurehe.
---
This is great but I wish the movie clip was after landing on the edge of the boat
---
My IRL / video game friends stopped playing games about 20 years ago. Could be worse. At least you can still play with them, though it may not be the games you prefer
---
i couldnt care less if someone wants to dungeon their way to 60, but when the top wow streamer does it, after saying he wanted the real experience, blizzard is see that and not really make retail wow awesome again. Why would they when the top dog is influencing thousands of others to just cheese their way through? its not like he alone will solely influence blizz to keeo on making retail hold your hand, but its damn gonna make a decent impact on their thinking
---
Unless Blizzard's /who command is malfunctioning we do know for certain.
---
TY
---
Horde has TourGuide IIRC.
---
Is the bag addon lighting up your items in color or is it some other addon ?
---
Same reason why people donate real money to them. Attention seeking behavior
---
Heads up desolace has a caravan that goes on the road when it hits its north most point and south most point an NPC spawns with 5 cooking recipes each.  So like 10 altogether.
---
Had a guy do this randomly to me at the Crossroads. Was amazing!
---
Great mechanic for banking
---
It wasnt an exploit because that's how people thought it was meant to be, they weren't knowingly exploiting a bug they just thought it was a really good XP method.
---
...But how did you take that last photo?
---
It’s the shadow damage increase they give that benefits locks
---
their resentment is understandable, it's an unfortunate situation that reflects negatively on the game they still love, and they've had to hunker down against the likes of retail haters for too long. i feel like a tab separation would be a nice small step into easing player anxiety on the matter, so the two communities wouldn't be forced to interact and compare
---
Mail order Taiwanese wife might be the best bet.
---
So who the hell IS buying from them?
---
yikes.
---
Thus began the reign of Captain Placeholder.
---
The issue there is that it's way harder on the bag space. you can stay in the ogre caves in southern duskwood, for example, and you only really have to take weapons, silk, wool, and greens, and everything else can kind of be destroyed or vendored and you can devote more bag spots to consumables, trade skills, or just staying out longer. 
---
If you instead, quest back and forth between darkshire and the ogre cave, you need to devote inventory space to wolf drop tables, spider drop tables, worgen drop tables, and ogre drop tables. 
---
You also have to fight nonideal mobs quite often. For example, I maintain that warriors are terrible in stranglethorn. Even if not for the pvp, the spread out mobs are hard to even make a pull out of in time for sweeping strikes. You don't want to fight a lot of the mobs in stranglethorn. 
---
You also have to fight a lot of mobs with things like immunity to bleeds, nasty debuffs, or instant cast heal over time effects, which warrior is bad against.  
---
But if you grind, you never have to fight bad mobs. You just decide "what am I good against", then you fight that. 
---
I will say though, grinding seems like you are behind on gear a lot of the time. A lot of the quests give very good gear, and so if you don't plan your grinding around getting the good quests done.... well, it takes a lot of ogre magi's staffs and firestarter wands to replace important drops like Morbent Fel's hat or the green hills of stranglethorn plate boots.
---
At what level does leveling as a mage starts becoming good?
---
Now I am filled with despair, oof.
---
One day
---
The fact they hotfixed and nerfed it substantially says no it's not.
---
Well this comment thread started with somebody talking about their paladin, so it seems relevant.
---
They're trying to encourage people to play both. Not fling shit at each other.
---
thx for all the downvotes btw...
---
:(
---
Seems like we learned nothing..
---
Tank still the  most needed role in wow
---
Oddly satisfying on a Mage with big pulls though.
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
Damn man this gives me the feels...takes me back to '07 plan LAN with the boys. Sadly the boys are long gone and aren't coming back, but I'll never forget the times we had. As excited as I was for launch it just hasn't been the same going solo.
---
We aren't playing the same game.
---
you want one?
---
Lol it's all good, brotha. Tiny bit salty tho.
---
Like retail. He would probably be happier in retail.
---
I'm married and have a good paying job (just BARELY 6 figures before taxes and after bonus). So I want to buy a house, and build a family. I'm also trying to break into screenwriting, which pays nothing but takes a lot of time and energy. So yeah, not much time for WoW. But hey, I've got my druid to 14 and have had fun so far. I may never hit 60 again, but that is what I love about classic. While, sure, it has some of that "endgame is the real game" aspect to it, it is nothing like retail. The fact that it takes so long to reach level cap really encourages you to just embrace the journey. 15 years ago I'd play nonstop. I wouldn't be in the competition for world first, but I'd probably be pretty close to 60 by now. I literally had 24+ hour gaming sessions and was a hardcore raider even before WoW (in EQ, I raided alongside several of the Blizz folks that actually built WoW on the Nameless server - Legacy of Steel). I don't say any of this to put you down, I support your choice, but certainly you should understand that many people that played WoW 15 years ago are in vastly different positions in their lives now.
---
Lol. If you say so.
---
I dont know why it was so hard to find that out.. guess I suck at looking stuff up for classic wow
---
Smooth AF
---
SM has been the worst for me. I'm a healer and I refuse to heal for people that do the aoe farm runs. Its basically no tank and me running oom every pull. It takes longer to do that unless you out level the place. You can almost pull non stop in SM with a real group set up. Every aoe farm has take longer than any basic dungeon run
---
Does that room smell like farts?
---
What? Reddit has a desktop version? I thought it was mobile only. What else, is there a Nintendo Switch version?
---
I already did and it’s doing this 🤗
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot makes the game pretty easy... though something like Questie is better medium between doing stuff yourself and also having hints where you're not just using your brain 24/7. Everything else is up to your personal needs. There is nice auction house scripts, skill helpers that guide you (good for new players), combat scripts for classes, etc.
---
Those mods over there, some are mods here too. We should kick them out.
---
Not at all worthless. Biggest Hunter Problem is between AQ40 and Naxxramas. But even there they are not useless, just not top dps.
---
Cries in shaman water quest
---
Is there a way to toggle right click so that i dont have to hold it down when turning around and moving in game?
---
Oh, I was playing retail back then, so I can now play WoW Classic for no cost forever because I was a loyal customer at that time? No, I need to keep paying $15 a month - that is the opposite of being free, because, you know, you have to pay money. 
---
Saying that something is free as long as you buy something else is usually just a marketing gimmick. Blizzard isn't even doing that here, if you look at their updated subscription page, they clearly call it a "World of Warcraft Subscription" which includes access to WoW and WoW Classic.
---
fair point. i like u
---
Sooo sick!!
---
Difficulty which makes your achievements feel earned and the need to talk to and work with other players.
---
Based username
---
Where the fuck are you questing to find that many herbs/ores?
---
I do realize that. However any macro, script or tool to do any automation is banable. You can clearly see the difference here, and the difference between these 2 methods should be easily identified.
---
I mean, someone who moves a bit every 20 minutes against someone who casts a buff or heal every 10 seconds. There is clearly a difference.
---
The fact that:
---
1.) You feel like you accomplished something every time you level
---
2.) Currency actually means something to the point where you will bargain with someone on an item to reduce it by a couple silver
---
3. There is a community that actually talks to one another(unlike retail where you’d be lucky to have a person say 1 word while in group)
---
4. Coming across people while questing in the world and actually helping out one another. Every time you group up with people, you run the chance that these guys(and gals) could become new friends that you play with consistently.
---
The list goes on.

I throw ice cubes at my girlfriend shouting "For The Alliance!" because I am a level 30 mage and I will never surrender and do the laundry.

Paladin is unfortunately the most boring class to level in the game. You have decent survivability, but your damage will be sub par to nearly every other class.
---
So couple these two things together and you have a boring/slow class.
---
The sweetener is that if you make it to 60, you’ll have the tankiest pvp healer in the game (that’s what is driving me anyway).
---
Oh God that was extremely pleasant, thank you so much.
---
Exactly. 
---
Play classic as classic. 
---
Not a powerleveler... 
---
That’s just like my opinion man...
---
So say we all.
---
Today I did a WC as a druid healer and the lock was doing this. So, I only healed him with first aid. I was perfectly fine with him doing life tap, but I wasn't gonna put a rejuve on him unless there was a big aoe fite or I was about to cap on mana.
---
Im not even mad
---
Pretty much same. I have a relationship, I'm trying to be good at distance running and I'm studying for a degree, which are good things in the long run, but deep inside all I want to do is just play 14 hours a day and go out maybe once in a week ...
---
No it's just to gauge how badly you smell like shit so you know when it's time to freshen/clean/wash up.
---
Yeah, this. Played for 15 minutes this morning before work and got so much shit done and didnt feel stressed about it. And after around lunchbreak I will have to start the "when should I start queue?"-game again. Once I get in after work Ill be afraid to leave the computer to go train or even grab something to eat.
---
It’s so stupid. If we’re fighting a boss and the tank dies, the others just need to hold him off until the tank runs back and rejoins the fight. Which isn’t very long when the dead tank respawns inside the dungeon.
---
I'm new to wow but this never made sense to me, people should need when they need right?
---
On my server the balance on horde seems good. I see a lot of everything, including druids and shamans.
---
Tailoring ench = more cash
---
My biggest gripe is how short of a distance nameplates will start to display. I can't get any cvar scripts to work. I just downloaded threatplates so hopefully that'll help.
---
I started to do this, but then those skill costs quickly became astronomical. I'm barely scraping by even while being stingy and AHing anything I can.
---
He would also fear me ocasionally (wlock) and saved my friend from a high level mob. Thanks bro
---
They didn't nerf it, they fixed a bug. 
---
Which brings us back to.....6+ dungeon groups are inefficient. As they should be.
---
Shaman have been the bane of my lowbie tanking experience.
---
i wish they were separated. dont wanna be able to play retail and wanna see separated sub  statistics for both games. everything they ve done with wow last... many years looks like huge mistake for me, so paying retail sub sounds like suporting/accepting this shit
---
Autism at full force.
---
I got the name zefram on my server haha
---
Doesn't the launcher autofill the username and password? That's why I've been using it
---
It was never an exploit. It was just a better alternative to leveling and blizz nerfed it so people would go back into the world. Jesus
---
That's not a bond. That's obedience.
---
Not that anyone cares to see it because retail has next to no immersion.
---
How can a warrior range pull?
---
Whatever floats your boat ^^
---
You can argue all you want, I'm just explaining what happened. The guy spoke to someone else and you hijacked the comment making him believe you were the person he originally responded to. You may wanna so "NO I WASN'T WAhuuu" but it is like this if you like it or not.
---
What if he dude had an emergency or something?
---
20+ isnt bad
---
Oh wow.. you are actually retarded, you arent trolling are you?
---
Welcome to the Exploration of classic
---
That doesn't make it better. Almost makes it worse imo. He's intentionally being a bad person because he gets rewarded for it..... Pavlov would be having a field day.
---
Get walkin.
---
only if its a kurzen medicine man
---
This is so horde...
---
I switched to alliance and can't believe how often I'm invited to groups to not miss tags and grinds
---
My experience playing horde was a case of fuck you I get mine.
---
I don't know why there is such a difference but as someone who has been horde for 13 years playing alliance is almost like the twilight zone
---
Fuck this is driving me insane too!!
---
Did this to a dude trying to resell first aid books. no ragrets
---
Must be Westfall A then, I see more druids than rogues.
---
Multishot, traps, pets and decent crowd control. Hunter is pretty viable afaik
---
Kekekekekekeke
---
You best believe that just because I tanked that dungeon instead of spending an extra 30min asking for somebody else to do it has no bearing on my need roll on that big joocy 2h wacking stick at the end.
---
I was hoping to grind these for xp but there didn't seem to be that many crimson whelps around 😕
---
 Oh ok. Phew
---
Auto run is probably the closest thing. I have it bound to middle mouse
---
You gotta look
---
I also have a paladin named bubbleandrun, a priest named catholicboy, and a warlock named mcwarlock
---
Yeah a lot of the people who would be running VC are probably new enough to not check
---
Exactly, It wasn’t a exploit or a bug. Blizz nerfed it so people would go back into the world.
---
What's the name of the add-on? Should I just look up Peggle add-on?
---
I did this for a level 30 rogue in the Kobold cave in Arathi highlands tonight.  He pulled way more than he could handle (which was two level 36 mobs :P),  I killed them for him, gave him a /hug and went on my way.  My hope is that some day when he has the opportunity to freely kill a random lower level horde in a rough situation he remembers me and pays it forward.  
---
We can make this world a better place, one act of kindness at a time!
---
Actually made me laugh out loud fantastic
---
I wonder if he played wow
---
That doesnt sound like an opposing faction
---
its because with less portals, teleports, and travel skips, it feels more like a world and less like a virtual main menu.
---
More then likely he couldn't even attack you because you weren't flagged for pvp yet. But, I bet he was being kind since you guys were such low levels haha
---
That's exactly the same model real airlines use to do pricing (A-&gt;B-&gt;C is sometimes cheaper than A-&gt;B and similar shenanigans)
---
oof
---
But how are you holding the camera taking a pic of everything else?
---
Only one way to find out. Library farm?
---
They must be killed to prevent the spread of the plague. Sorry.
---
Yeah, but what amazes me most is that people dont pay any attention at all, i have seen quite a few people just running headlong into him on that road... what is it about a skull-marked elite that you dont understand?
---
\*SPLAT\*
---
I just wanna pvp so i went warlock
---
Sounds like a great night of gaming. Glad you had fun!
---
Mage is far and away the best spell cleave class, warlock is okish. Not as good dps or kiting but summons/stones are very handy.
---
Engineering is bis for pvp for any class
---
I loved that terror of seeing a skull enemy player in a PvP zone and know that even death does not release you from the torment of being spawn camped. No matter the distance, it all leads back to being camped.
---
Check your operating system's accessibility settings.
---
Thanks for the help! Was about 8 hours of whelps for both drops. How many leathers did you end up with ?!  -Takory Incendius
---
Engineering.
---
People buying bags
---
Yes, commute is the most wasted time in a day. First thing to change if you want happier life.
---
Gives you something to work for which is very rewarding.
---
What , on my realm everyone is a gnome mage
---
you shouldn't underestimate autists, they'd pick you apart
---
Well played, indeed.
---
Well now you can take a lil break knowing you are far ahead of the pack and have accomplished your goals.
---
Go make your wife happy!
---
Normally have my sound off so not sure, but it does have a message in chat that tells you and a little symbol that you can put near where you normally look that may be easier to see.
---
Not sure if it is in currently but it was back in the day, if you entangling roots the sickly gazelle before curing them it counts for the quest twice.
---
Damn it! I sold mine!
---
Does everyone here forget the XP potions? No one knew abusing them was an exploit until Blizzard disciplined a lot of people (Asmongold included) for using them in the manner they did. 
---
It was clearly an exploit, whether published or not.
---
EU Alliance on Shazzarah here.
---
Just like having a good active Guild chat to get involved with while leveling.
---
Not exactly an avid raider, never do it before but would love to give it a try.
---
On the note about Shamans...Does anyone know a good way to see things dispellable by Purge? I very rarely use the ability.
---
I thoroughly enjoy the extra foliage. But yes, it's a good idea to turn it off if you're doing a quest like this (I just did it with wildkin feathers).
---
Seeing buffs requires the mage spell "Detect Magic".

﻿**&lt;The King's Guard&gt;**
---
**Server**: Remulos (OCE | PvE) 
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
Looking for a casual Kiwi guild with friendly, helpful players?
---
**About**
---
**The King's Guard** are protectors of the realm. For the Alliance! 
---
We understand that everyone has a life: job, family, and other commitments.
---
We plan to run dungeons together, help each other out with quests, hang out and chat, and just enjoy our return to Azeroth.
---
We will raid and do battlegrounds at level 60, but there is no pressure to rush to 60 or to take part in either.
---
**Expectations**
---
Have a decent attitude towards everyone. Be willing to overlook mistakes and offer to help and support other players wherever you can. This is about community and friendship.
---
**Timezone**
---
Most players will be on during peak Oceanic times. Raiding will probably be two days a week, 9-11pm NZST (New Zealand Standard Time).
---
**Loot rules**
---
As a casual guild, we are strongly considering Suicide Kings. Loot drama should never be an issue with mature, friendly players.
---
**Apply**
---
If you're an Oceanic player looking for a great home, come check us out: https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3
---
Peace.

My guild in vanilla was littered with mouthbreathers and we still cleared twin emps and about half of naxx. When TBC came out they couldn't clear T5.
---
That's great :D classic wow is amazing
---
He make a guess, obviously
---
Yea.. i will eventually. Landed a very nice job at a very nice company in Los Angeles... I'm putting in my two years of suffering then I'm out of there.
---
Even worse are the people who come up and take a quest node from you. When you are clearly fighting on top of it. 
---
Those are the worst. I just want to finish my quests man.
---
can you give more information?
---
**Myth of the void | Alliance | Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are looking for experienced and non-experienced players to join our family styled guild, we are wanting to build our ranks prior to Classic so we can get a head start on helping out our guildies with leveling, dungeons, farming and more. Our goal is to down the raids as they release but it is not mandatory to show up to raid (aka you wont get kicked) we know RL happens. So if your looking for a tight knit group of people looking to down raids, farm gear, lvl professions we are the Guild for you!
---
We hope you enjoy your time here! We’ll see you in Classic!
---
**Server:**

**Raid Times:**
---
Thursday: 9pm-11pm (EST)

---
Ya I don’t understand the decision behind making the leveling up process faster; there’s no sense of achievement in being able to race to max level. 
---
The game already was faster than others like it at the time, FFXI was much slower going and really lets you experience the process.
---
why is there no listing of each guilds server? Spreadsheet seems kind of useless if you cant find guilds for your specific realm
---
Or maybe switch Classic and BfA, so BfA is in the drop down. Considering more are probably playing Classic right now, it has become the main game, at least for a while. ;)
---
What are you on seriously? People racing /who every hour and to have any chance of getting to 60 you need to play 15 hours a day. It is extremely obvious to anyone that cares who the server first of a class on a faction is. There is no way to trick or hide it.
---
It's not for everyone but I like to get a good spawn rotation going, chill, listen to youtube/podcasts/watch something on other monitor. 
---
I can also grind in a Horde contested area and get lot's of pvp, that is lots of fun!
---
Loch Modan is a good option to gain another level or two if you don't want to go all the way to Darkshore.
---
Instructions unclear, penis stuck in Linux.
---
If you don't enjoy your character, reroll. You might like it later but the chances of not enjoying yourself are much higher, sunken cost fallacy is a drain.
---
i need 65 mining for tin nodes?
---
Who cares how you launch the game?
---
I'm sitting just under 30 and can confirm, mostly players are just enjoying themselves in my bracket :)
---
It's been so long since I played WoW that I forgot that sense of dread I felt when I saw the boat moving and I wasn't sure if I would make it in time.
---
Why is overcrowded realms a thing. Why can't they solve that problem? You and I both know choosing a server was a shit show leading up to and after the first 3-4 days.
---
Same here. I still give away white gear to lower levels but I try to sell the greens.
---
We've got a guy who has just started playing wow for the first time with us on classic, cutest times
---
Roll whatever you like my friend,there is no rule about how things should be done, all experience is unique.
---
I didn't want to play classic because of all those people saying hyped stuff. ITs always the more people hyping stuff the less i want to play it. Still gave it a fair chance and tryed it last weekend. Leveled a shaman to 14 then thought na better level a mage so i started over and am at level 14 again yesterday.
---
Its very time consuming more then i want it to be but if i have the decision to level chilled in classic or get angry about m+ in retail ... i never thought i would say that but i gladly chose classic leveling. Someone just gave me a cool gear piece with 6 fire dmg on it thats like 10% more fireball dmg i assume and i can't wait to put them on next level.
---
I don't know how such things or player mentallity change in the next weeks or months but so far ... and i can't believe im saying this ... i really enjoy classic
---
Now that's old
---
I'm not sure if I should reroll on this server I'm on or reroll on the newer, lowest populated server as the opposite faction.
---
Isn't mail instant across the same account?
---
So you still have 100 hours to gain 38 lvls.
---
[Yep](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mining)
---
Money can be made through other means, engineering gives you insane benefits in every way. There is no excuse not to have it as one of your proffesions.
---
Well, if its an PVE Server, then transferring your cash is quite easy using the shared Auction House. If its PVP, you would need a second account or ask around if somebody assists you in the transfer.
---
THe thing is healers are often just looking at the green bars, so Aggro damage vs life taps are difficult to distinguish in the moment
---
Not on a pvp server
---
Haha you're right :D
---
I started playing in WotLk and i never used any kind of questing addons and i missed out on so much lore lol. Unless you read all the quest text and listen to all the NPC's its very easy to miss out. Im a huge fan of Warcraft but that came from watching videos about the lore etc... in the game all that matters is fun.
---
Make that your top priority and play what you enjoy looking at thats how i choose.
---
In that case you could probably been world first. But the clicking held you 2 days back :D
---
Why are people so against southparking it? Its sometimes faster than quest chains and can get you alot of greens or leathers which is a shit ton of money made. Just kick back throw on some tunes and kill some mobs mails greens to bank alt sell skins rinse and repeat. That being said ill definatley quest until it becomes tedious. I probably do both 50/50.
---
?
---
Mope, she met her husband on wow... still  married
---
It does. Thank you.
---
He wouldn’t have had it any other way man. He’d be proud.
---
grats!
---
I would suggest a medium-high pop server not low, only because they have a better chance of not becoming a dead server. I have a few characters on Rattlegore and it’s medium most of the day and then high during peak times but never full or queues.
---
Lol I doubt world first but it probably would have saved me hours.
---
Alot of people see it as "pay to win". People with more money getting things "faster/easier" because they threw more money at it. (Even if it actually takes alot of setup and skill to do.) The multiboxers in pvp and the multiboxers who screw with the retail economy add to the bad reputation. It sucks but thats how people see it.
---
I never said I didn't enjoy the game.  I love the endgame, but not leveling.  I have to level to get to the endgame.  Just because you don't like one aspect of something doesn't mean you don't enjoy it at all.  Simple.
---
And no, actually I was pretty casual the first time and only cleared MC and did partial runs of AQ 20/40.  I never did Ony, BWL or Naxx.  My guild already has a core raid group set up and are of the same mindset as me.  The faster we level, the faster we can gear pre-raid, faster we can clear MC, faster we can do content we never got to see.
---
If you actually read my post, I already said I'm doing this for me, not because I'm trying to compete with anyone.  Thanks for the lecture about how me playing the game differently from you is wrong, though.  I appreciate that.
---
Probably not, the majority don't care.
---
Most of those leave the group after the first wipe anyways
---
The servers that were released hours before the game went live are high pop and no longer have queues. I can't get a list at work, but you can look them up. I'd take one of those if you're in the Americas.
---
Bank. Use it!
---
Yeah our group abandoned because the leader was unhappy with the XP per hour :/
---
Sweet
---
`/console SET ffxglow 0`
---
Will remove some of the bright white light while dead (and alive)
---
Do you have any friends that play? If you did I think you'd understand the gripe I have instead of defending Blizzard. Why is this even a problem?
---
You're forgetting improved life tap spec. Plus, dl is 5 second channel, so you're getting spirit regen when it ends.
---
Yeah maybe not the lore but... The sense of exploration vanishes when using addons and why would one let this huge world go to waste with addons? Feels like I missed part of it.
---
The vanilla was a large part about exploration.
---
Maybe you should try not making an "edgy" name that is obviously border line inappropriate. Can't get mad about getting caught playing it risky, regardless if it was a snitch or just caught by the Blizz bots.
---
If I don’t have aggro, I have no reason to be above 10% health. Life is a resource for us 😎
---
Drain life is value-neutral resource wise. The mana cost to health restored is roughly even. Furthermore, it is actually *worse* as a resource regen, because it actually interrupts your 5 second rule, so you would be better off wanding. Drain life should not be used to fund taps, it is only useful if you're already at a mana surplus and you need to exchange it for health.
---
I'm actually leveling on both sides, but this my first time playing horde, and I have to agree that getting fellow horde to invite before killing a quest mob and running off is very frequent. I don't have as many problems on Alli, but it does still happen.
---
Why was this marked nsfw?
---
which leads to a full disband.
---
the retail mentality is still strong here.
---
Healcomm
---
Memorial Day weekend, plus weekends in general ques will raise, same thing happens after 5pm on weekdays. Tis when 1st shift and kids get home.
---
I have never seen this before!
---
So some mins don’t have a Max range they will chase you?
---
Same, do not want teh work. I should be sleeping rn actually lol.
---
When things like this happen I imagine that my character misbehaved on the ship and was thrown into the ocean to die. It makes me feel better knowing that my he probably  deserved it.
---
Use AUX it kinda work with stack per price but its a little bit laggy compared to its TBC version due to Classic/Vanilla’s AH limitation, it need to search back for the auction before you can buy it so it can be bought meanwhile you search for it
---
Here’s a link:
---
https://github.com/shirsig/aux-addon
---
Less complex rotations? Wait what?
---
Envy is it... As someone who played most of his time as filthy belf pala who started in TBC I dearly miss my favorite class. I never rolled an alliance character, neither did it make much sense to start one now as all my returning friends also play horde.
---
I think it was a good decision that they gave both factions access to the same classes in TBC, I see why restricting one because of the identity makes sense, I'm just not a fan of it though. Mostly I like to tank so warrior now is it but the class doesn't hit the same itch. As far as I know bears and prot weren't on their level in classic anyway... 
---
Still, I do miss my seals, auras, mana and offheals.
---
You tell me, you're looking at an upvoted thread suggesting you should treat transpeople better than regular people.
---
If they're managing their threat and understand they below the tank and myself on the heal priority list Locks can tap all they want. More DPS is a good thing.
---
Yes dad
---
Retail: tons of things to ‘do’ but actually nobody does. 
---
Classic: not as much things to do but every is actually doing it.
---
I'm pretty sure most mobs don't have a max range.
---
My Void is named nearly like a pokemon. His name is Makmon.
---
God I love TB. Such a serene and tranquil place. The music really makes it.
---
It’s fun with sow leveling again. I only struggle with the fact that I have done it all before.... I hope I can get over that “done that already” feeling....
---
&gt; Is it just me who gets frustrated by this as a healer?
---
I used to, but then I realized I'm under no obligation to re-fill them. I throw a hot on if I have mana, if they die then 1) they're doing too much damage and need to slow down 2) lifetapping less will help them slow down on damage as they'll have less mana to burst with.
---
As a warlock, I lifetap fully prepared to heal myself and to use my demon armor's Mana Regen.  Don't blame the warlock for your own ocd.
---
Life tap is mana management.  They shouldn't be a priority to heal, let them drain life, health stone etc.
---
Really though? Just use it. It is there to be used. You will make many more gold at higher levels.
---
I ask the group "give me a second or two to get some threat." Shaman runs up and earth shocks immediately... it happens in nearly every dungeon I tank.
---
Yes I’d say a lot did, especially given the near day-long queues. When OCE queues started last night (Monday) they started small closer to 5pm and within 30min were double I.e 1k to 2k eventually up to 5-6k at peak.
---
This is different from Friday midday where there was a large queue from midday/2pm-ish and it never really got smaller until after midnight.
---
I should be sleeping as well.
---
This guy is unhappy IRL
---
Oh congrats on 30!
---
Rogue has a 15 second 5 minute cool down sprint it’s okay but yeah it’s no aspect of cheetah haha.
---
More like NSFL
---
This.  If theres a bug ranting, whining, and crying does nothing. Make a detailed bug report so they can actually fix it.
---
I started playing 2 days ago with a couple of Friends and I realized that I Always get Aggro when I heal someone. My friend even used a taunt and I usually still Jeep Aggro.      
---
This is in Open world tho.
---
Now get me a beer ya little shit
---
Hey Man. My gf and my roommate as well as other buddy are playing on Sulfuras, alliance. If you’re interested in joining, shoot me a PM. We all just started leveling on that server so we are around level 8. I am a night elf Druid, my buddies are a night elf hunter and then another night elf Druid, and my gf is a night elf priest.
---
Yes, my friends joined me on bigglesworth, the newest server available and dont have any queue problems.
---
We thought to ourselfs "whats better, sitting in queue with our names? or playing the game and maybe get our names?"
---
Just wait a couple weeks. It sounds like you've had the bad luck of getting grouped with BFA players who don't understand how things differ in Classic. These players will undoubtedly quit out of frustration over the next little while and we'll all be left with players who understand that they're not invincible in Classic, that healers need mana breaks in Classic, that you can't get by with button mashing in Classic, and that class/group-role snobbery isn't necessary or appreciated in Classic.   
---
It's a learning curve for everyone right now, even players that were around for original Classic back in the day (for example, I died from over-pulling in PVE *way* more times than I should have needed to to learn my lesson).  
---
People will either *learn* or they'll quit and go back to BFA.  
---
I've only done the one dungeon so far myself and my experience was extremely pleasant. Everyone was patient with the tank, everyone stopped for the healer when O.O.M, no one was in a hurry, everyone was reasonable with loot. The only thing that could have been done better imo, was that DPS could have targeted the tanks target (to be fair the tank had to rotate between targets often anyway), and focused casters first.   
---
In the mean time I guess all you can do is give tips and advice to your group members and hope they listen and learn and become better players for it.
---
everything is frustrating as a healer, the worst current trends I’ve found are
---
people in leather thinking  “ah yeah I’ll tank a few mobs to help out the warrior”
---
or 
---
“why aren’t you healing me” after they let 3 mobs aggro to me and I have to power word shield and cast a 3 second heal just to survive
---
At 18, I think I'd recommend the Gnolls in Redridge. Cloth in general drops from humanoids, and you'll probably still get linen from that particular mob as well, but as your move up in levels it'll phase out.
---
Your UI is SO CLEAN!
---
Does anyone know how to calculate when a set level of MP5 is better than Spirit? Ex. got a green ring with +3 mana per 5 seconds. Is that better than a 6 spirit ring?
---
It's not thay big a deal..?
---
(no I'm not a lock player) just don't heal them, their hp will regen and if they take aggro and die ifs their own fault.
---
Hahahah same thing happened to me 6 hours ago. I bought 5 more silver ore and I got the skill up at the last one
---
Just do standard 1 2 3 4 5 6, then shift + 1 2 3 4 5 6.
---
After that, any keys you can reach easily like Q E F, then shift + Q E F.
---
If it means you wont burn another cigert on me then yessir
---
I wish my laptop could run past graphics setting 3 (classic)  :(
---
Once you have improved wand damage talent go for spirit tap. That way if you've stopped casting for 5 seconds before the mob dies and have been just wanding it you generate a boatload of mana. Once spirit tap is done you shield up, heal if you need it, and pull again. Leads to smooth sailing with little downtime drinking
---
I guess I’m just stingy lol - in the end it’s his gold to do what he wants with. I agree with you there.
---
Because sinister strike does your weapon damage + and extra set amount. 
---
What you need to learn to do is use sinister strike right after a melee hit, so you dont waste a melee swing.  This potentially Will give more sword spec/hand of justice/Windfury procs.
---
People can still enjoy the game, or they can enjoy drama too. It's not like people hate the game because they're paying attention to drama.
---
Yup, same. I have ally on a normally full server that I hop on when there’s no Q or if I’m home and can put myself in line ready to hop on when it’s time. If I’m limited on time and can’t sit in Q, I’ll play my horde on a lower pop server that rarely has a wait time. Honestly kind of works out better that horde/ally can’t be on the same server. I never wait either way
---
It may be in your interest to play something other than healer if you think that way.
---
This is not retail where you can just pew pew your way through a dungeon.
---
Shouldn't it be falln't?
---
I just use simple  
---
/target &lt;mobname&gt;  
---
/cast Moonfire  
---
This works just fine even it does spam "target is not alive" if you have corpse on ground.
---
Darkshore has loads of quests go there get to 18 then go to red ridge
---
Hey everyone - quick question. Are the wow classic graphics updated or are they truly classic? Thanks

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cz0ryf/as_of_right_now_what_raids_are_released/). 
---
Reduce layers: omg I can’t kill anything, there’s too many people, omg queues, they gotta fix it. 
---
Increase Layers: there’s no one anywhere, I can’t people to kill elites, it’s too empty.
---
Fuck all the people telling you to get mining. You do you. Leveling engineering and blacksmithing at the same time might suck but it'll be unique and rewarding once you're done. I'm proud of you for having fun.
---
Yeah because it would feel new. Although 40 man raids with this type of graphics would probably require a computer so expensive that the last thing you’d need to worry about is the monthly subscription cost.
---
Oh I love revenge for blatant kill stealing.  I’m a rogue and if I know the exact location a mob will spawn I will tag it.  Fast dagger and faster spamming of sinister strike.  
---
I had one guy swoop in and ks a quest mob in arathi highlands.  It was the last of three and I would have been better off skipping the whole thing with the time it took.  I got lazy since no one else was around. 
---
Well, the lock kills it and tells me to get fucked so I decide to ruin his night because you know these players likely rage when it happens to them.  I follow shitbag around and continuously tag each mob they go for 3-4 times. Probably about an hour, maybe a bit more.  I invite others who show up and tag it for them. 
---
My fingers felt like they were going to break but it was worth it for the expletive laced tells and begging.
---
I also dont AOE grind, but single target frost.
---
And I just love the control frost play.
---
I can easily kite and take down stronger mobs, just wait till you get more spells! 
---
Like blink and cone of cold!
---
I also have r1 frostbolt still on bar for quick casted freeze and stuff.
---
Or try fire maybe? But its kinda the same with fire instead of frost and less control lol
---
I've camped his spawn for about 7 hours total so far with a target macro, getting spam invited to different layers. Haven't even seen him. 
---
Looks like I've done the same googling as you -- private servers have really muddied the waters as far as a respawn timer goes. Looks like somewhere between 24-36 hours is most likely from my research, but I'm not sure we have confirmation with layering confusing it all. 
---
You're right, timers are really unhelpful with layering because you have no idea which layer your timer applies to. 
---
Do you mind sharing where you found him? Is he spawning in the hut, or did you find him patrolling? Was he in the one of the ships?
---
They were getting ganked non stop, because they rolled on a PVP server. They were complaining about not being able to quest or level, then all of a sudden this bug magically appears.
---
&gt; My memory is pretty good because it's recent (pservers)
---
We're not talking about private servers. You said dungeons used to be cleared methodically, and I'm pointing out that's not the case. I'm sure any number of us could post horror stories from the Good Old Days.
---
mograine
---
I got tongues with like 90% drop chance. But that ichor.. I must've killed nearly 30 spiders to get that
---
Tarren Mill and Sepulcher are both Undercity.
---
Unfortunately though, now there are people there to laugh at me when I accidentally autorun off the ledge :(
---
Worst one for me so far is shamans casting earthshock in the beginning of every pull.
---
It's like this because the guy can't read usernames? LUL
---
I personally enjoy grinding and ive done those quests to many times and find them tedious
---
Is this working for anyone? I get no response from this, and I'm not seeing from the code where a trade window is meant to be opened? Should I have a /trade above the code?
---
U r lucky u dont have to install from DVDs man
---
Not at lvl 14 tho.. you got plenty of places to quest. Just takes some traveling.
---
You must have misread! Him and his priest are in high demand. The highest probably.
---
retail model?!
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
epic quest lines
---
class quest lines
---
having to walk until level 40
---
actually talking with people instead of using a silly LFG button. 
---
Having to travel and fight your way to a dungeon instead of just being teleported.
---
World PVP 
---
all the things you mentioned are exactly why it is better and more fun than retail
---
You weren't wrong...
---
But a power leveler is questing
---
You strategise for every pull though? That seems really unnecessary. I'm all for taking it slower, but over-analysing every pull would have me pulling my hair out.
---
I looked up the dire wand on wowhead and it says the damage range is 24-45 shadow damage so you are hitting correctly. Are you possibly looking at the damage of your main hand weapon instead of your ranged weapon?
---
Be patient. Get a nice guild. Wait for the idiots to go back to school/back to BFA. By October, I'm guessing, things will get better.
---
BDO your way thru WoW.
---
They resell them for convenience, not everybody wants to run to fucking stromgarde.
---
Damn I hoped that wasnt the case, will do. They dont seem to have done anything though
---
What did everyone level? How far did everyone get?
---
God that quest took me so long
---
It will probably even out once people start getting some money.
---
You have to remember how fresh the economy is. Everyone is broke with the exception of a few. I've got two toons with a combined level of 15. There are people that cleared MC already.
---
I'm sure most people arent even close to getting to MC yet.
---
Having purchased one last year...probably not. I mean it's nice, don't get me wrong, just not necessarily more comfortable than any other nice computer chair. And those other nice computer chairs are probably about half the price. I got mine on sale for $300, I think it was normally $450...for $150-200 I could've gone to Office Depot and bought one just as comfortable, albeit less cool looking.
---
My back does hurt less after a long gaming session than it used to with the crappy 15 year old chair I was using before (my primary reason for upgrading), but again, I probably could've gotten the same results with a less expensive non-gaming chair.
---
&gt; I thought this was viewed as being in poor taste now?
---
only by bitter manlets.
---
Buy and vendor
---
All of that makes a lot of sense and the stacks of 1 might not be causing it honestly. I'm currently on Stalagg-Horde and it's definitely slowing it down at least a little for profession mats compared to a few days ago, even after disabling AH addons. Not saying a fix is absolutely needed, but I just think an eye should be kept on it just in case.
---
Yes it's not in absolutes, but it is definitely a noticeable difference
---
If you're spamming dl you wont get the regen, if you factor in all your dots your're still at a net loss of health-mana for a suboptimal dmg rotation.
---
Or you end up following a group of players that are clearing and obviously abandoning beast corpses everywhere. 
---
I don't feel like a golden retriever though. Maybe some sort of odd biorecycler.
---
I have atleast over 50 already spamming world chat.
---
How's  leveling as cat form?  I am thinking of rolling druid
---
Had the same thing. As a Druid in graveyard I rolled need on the cloth helm that drops from the rare. This guild got pissed because I needed it and I should have let their priest have it. They then said they wouldn’t run with me anymore. I was like uhh ok.
---
frost nova, Blink. counterspell, cone of cold, poly and frostbolt all used fairly regularly i actually find frost fun when not raiding.
---
if ah means ironforge ah? wondering, because all faction ah are connected. i know this wasn't always the state in vanilla, but by 1.12 they got connected.
---
farming it... it can drop from every mob in the barrens, chances are between 0.3% and 3%. could take some time tbh
---
thank you. :)
---
Troll druid BiS
---
Dude was already ahead of everyone else. He would've got it either way.
---
What phone is that? Looks nice
---
I saw a group of horde run deadmines on my server. I was basically cheering them on because I thought it was awesome.
---
I disagree. They won’t take a year to roll out PvP
---
Shaman privilege
---
You can play together right away if one of you is willing to do the "death run" through the Wetlands.
---
You can have either. There's a slider option called classic.
---
Anyone who had a problem with it should have just swapped to horde imo.
---
It is not
---
Nice ui for a phonegame
---
I don't mind it at all. If a warlock is frequently life tapping below 30/40% I get annoyed at them. I don't want them pulling aggro with all their new mana and then end up dying. I'm in no rush to heal a warlock without aggro. Especially one sitting at around 80%. 
---
What I hate is the warlock using my mana as a replacement for drinking water. I've seen warlocks life tap to under 10hp after each fight instead of drinking. Makes me waste more water and makes us take longer to get going
---
It's like why must work get in the way of my 15 hr grinds ...
---
Idk if “by a higher level sponsor” is part of the literal definition of it. People can just choose to stop leveling and go for the BiS gear through AH and call themselves twinks.
---
A mage not AOEing is a poor version of an Warlock.
---
Totally agree with this.
---
No? I didn't even play Vanilla. I just want a realm without addons.
---
Not on my server.  Wool is selling for more than silk.
---
Why are you using world in the first place?
---
lol wow
---
If you want to remain stagnant and keep making 35k a year for the rest of your life that’s on you: but you’ll never make significantly more unless you change careers or do something drastic. And if you’re spending a lot of time playing world of Warcraft instead of increasing earning potential I guess that’s tour choice too.
---
u got it sir
---
I mean retail is still around and this has been in demand for a while it doesn't seem like it's just for a nostalgic trip
---
That warlock one really hurt after waiting 15 minutes for bellygrub to spawn.
---
questie
---
I don’t really pay attention to chat, I care about player interactions. These 3 were exceptionally poor experiences. I don’t intend to tank for them in the future.
---
You get 5% per rep level. 5% at friendly and 20% at exalted. Pretty sure this applies to all vendors and trainers.
---
Long term plans are unknown at the moment.
---
Hell, they might end up doing like Old School RuneScape did and start branching off in a different direction with new content instead.
---
Loads of iron in stv!
---
shut the f up and suck this big neck -- Daddy Long Neck
---
I am using allyroute.com, check that one out
---
and by "oops" you mean you're a piece of crap who needs their account permanently deleted? Got it.
---
While leveling just pick the highest dps ones you can get.
---
I haven't died to it yet, but ultimately do whatever you're comfortable with doing.
---
i am dismissing your case due to lack of evidence. the defendant is... not guilty! *dok*
---
I just ran BFD for an insane wand. I'm more excited about this level 19 wand then I've ever been to get a piece of gear in bfa. It does almost 30 dps.
---
My ignore list is twice as big as my friends list atm.
---
I too enjoy my time with Spirit Healer after a good crush.
---
Yeah, I feel like everyone that’s ever wanted to level a rogue already played one in vanilla or has one in retail so they want to try something new.
---
Hi, /u/Hami-ZA

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cz0tqo/guest_pass/). 
---
Even two years after the final phase i guarantee you most guilds will not be clearing Naxx,
---
Guidelime is the best one. Make sure you have the latest version with a good guide loaded. Right click the window, u’ll Find a bunch of options including changing the size of the window and changing the lime icons to arrows etc.
---
I was giving out 1s for guild charter signatures, and one guy whispers me saying "did you play vanilla? one silver took hours"
---
If you want gold/levelling the best thing would be to find a quiet mob grinding spot and put on a good tv show. Humanoids drop decent vendor greys, beasts can be skinned (at this point though its more efficient to vendor the leather than sell on the AH). Id grind one type for 30 mins then the other for 30 mins and compare exp/gold gained to decide what you want to stick to. 
---
My personal gold plan is to grind as much raw gold as i can to buyout select mats at this low cost for when they eventually go up in price. Specifically pvp related things so when phases 2 and 3 come out i can roll in free money.
---
Look for math loopholes too. Leather selling for vendor price but you can craft x item that total vendors for more? Buy it out and craft that item to vendor. This method is slow but a good afk method. I have a few things like this ive been doing.
---
It will get way better when you start doing shatter combos, you don't have to aoe farm. Get those frostbite procs and shatter for juicy crits
---
I got killed leaving ratchet, released. And then I spawned with 100% on the boat in STV
---
There were 2 Ally, 10 horde. They tried ganking me but I managed to survive until the docks (priest) and then the brawlers fucked them up.
---
Party on, Wayne
---
No it isn't fucking journey was ahead of why single apes player.  Hunter druids locks probably priest can all solo garter then dungeon grinding at Mac efficiency.  Yes apes used dungeons to get the 9 warriors they had to 60. Like I said IF you have a bad solo class.
---
In my groups I announce ahead of time that we roll for chests. People who break that agreement get kicked. No mercy, they were warned.
---
I'm always a tank or healer anyway and it's always a DPS who we can replace in seconds if need be.
---
In classic the accessibility of meeting people is higher because to do stuff like dungeons, group quests and finding information you actually have to be social with people. The game is a lot slower, so you fill the downtime by engaging with other players.
---
Yes, it's  possible on retail, but not as common or easy to do.
---
EU RP server=no queue
---
So actually I went to sell potions to a guildy, but he didnt like the prices (even though I was going below market because guildy) but decided "hey you can have it for free" because I WAS already flipping herbs on the auction house into more potions and making a decent profit. 
---
But even though I never sent it with a COD, he still sent me back mail with money. Now I almost want to send him double the money tomorrow.
---
It may become a problem of giving.
---
My biggest issue is something that (thankfully) I've only seen a few times and it goes like this;
---
Bigxmexy: LF1M RFK 30+
---
Bigxmexy - 26 Undead Rogue
---
Its cool to want a certain level for the dungeon, totally understandable, but at what point are you just asking to be carried?
---
I would recommend watching a guide about warrior kiting. With a slow 2 hander you don’t want to let your opponent hit you more times than you hit him. Helped me a great deal with sustaining health questing.
---
have 4 of them from GY farming
---
Void elves are nonsensical. Apparently, the whole race is a group of researchers that were exiled together with Umbric. How many people that could have possibly been? Twenty? Fifty?
---
That screen shot is hilarious btw
---
You must have massive hands if you can comfortably hit 6 without taking your other fingers off the movement keys
---
? Because not everyone is ally and you can equip WW at 30
---
Yea zygor is better
---
I don’t expect anyone to go alone in a social game. However there’s a difference between leveling with people at the same place as you and groups going at it. That’s some fun times. I love that shit.
---
What is lame is when a group of players intentionally flood low level zones where the people they are griefing have no chance of defending themselves. Those people are shit, and likely are doing that because they can’t hang with people at their level.
---
I got renamed and didn't get suspended. There's more to the story.

Not gonna lie. Pretty jealous of your obviously wonderful rl friend group. I hope you appreciate the rarity of such a blessing.

Dang it I swear that I have seen whattislove on whitemane before
---
I have regular sized hands, though my sample group may just have big hands
---
Calm down dude, jeez
---
Yep, just like I tell my dog, you can chase all the squirrels you want, just be smart about it.
---
Watches dog run into traffic.
---
I mean...
---
I've no shit played wow more this week than I've played any game for over a year. All been dead for me so long then classic come and holy shit I'm having fun
---
lol
---
People overestimate their survival ability when it comes to classic.  You had to use cc, be selective when it came to mobs, not just run in and aoe at will
---
exactly Earlier today i did the final part of the tower of athalax could not find help i had to use every trick in the book to get it done felt very rewarding although there was no one to see.
---
you act like its some struggle to find the classic option and just, you know, leave it on that, you never have to see it say the retail version.
---
You’d be right post 55, pre 55 not so much, healer isn’t struggling for mana, and the prot paladin (not warrior or Druid no rage generation) is going to be drinking after every other pull anyway. Doesn’t even have a spike on his shield.
---
WoW has a build-in Screenshot Funktion. It saves your Screenshots to your WoW Folder.
---
Also taking screenshots on console is as easy too. On xbox your press the guide button (xbox logo) on the controller and press Y afterwards. Your screenshot will be uploaded to XBL so you can easily share it via gamedvr.com or similar sites
---
I don't need to make more, just save at my current rate. 
---
At my current rate of saving I'll have well north $1.45 Mil saved by the time I'm 65, inflation adjusted. 
---
That's more than double what I need to retire comfortably without touching the principal.
---
I do wand for 8ish secs on pull if the tank says something about it.
---
However unpopular opinion but if the dps focus one target from max range it usually dies before it gets to them so the tank can completely ignore it while building threat (or rage for later pulls if there is only 1 other mob).
---
I have been in groups who preffered either way but the second one is faster and saver because one enemy essentially gets kited to death. 
---
I also tanked way back in vanilla and honestly the best way to get threat is to steal it from dps since taunting off of them instantly gives you 110% threat so if you wait until a mob almost reaches a dps while pooling rage from the other mobs, then taunt and sunder 4 times that usually does the trick.
---
Do you hit 6 with your thumb or something? I can hold w and a at the same time and still hit 6
---
big F to the guy on the left who didn't make it .,(
---
r/woosh
---
Id say it ends with ZF, after that you wont have people trying to aoe down everything
---
with 3 days played *you* would not be 120. but yes retail bad classic good
---
You can complete the quest to pick up the rod. 
---
After that dont pick up the followup, this way you keep your quest log clear and you get to keep the rod.
---
Just for info dire maul is not yet available, else it's less than 2 days of played for a mage to XP through it
---
I can hit it 7, it's just uncomfortable to go further than 5
---
How can I keybind dungeon marks?
---
I'd say they're a frequent occurrence on RP-PVP servers. They'll only get more common as people get leveled and the more serious guilds are done with raid related tasks.
---
its almost like it stays on the last one you played?
---
You can equip it at 30 but if I remember correctly, it requires either a group of several lvl 35+ people helping. Seems like a huge pain to do on a fresh server.
---
And I didn’t realize bone biter was ally only so I guess the question really only applies to half the players. Still for alliance i feel like waiting for 34 and getting bonebiter is the more efficient option.
---
do people really report names? fucking why?
---
I honestly didn’t realize how much of a blessing this actually was until I posted here. But now I cherish this moment a lot more.
---
You know you get your deposit back if you sell the item tho right.
---
I had a rogue in vanilla wow, but mostly did PvP with daggers. 
---
But I heard people saying Hemo build is probably the best build for PvP. But which weapons to use? I heard people like to Ambush with dagger, then switch weapons to swords? Can you switch weapons in combat?
---
Need electricity to power computer...
---
You can heal ALL dungeons in a DPS spec.
---
Funny thing. I’m not.  I just did the quest and only saw 1 dead deer.  It was simply something that I wasn’t aware of and I thought I’d share.
---
Guess my years of practice is finally paying off!
---
That poor hardwood floor, all those wheels and no mats to protect it from them D:
---
I have tons of skins I just don’t know how to craft? Is there a schematic I need or someone I have to go talk to? (I have the profession)
---
pro tip: your phone can takes screenshots so you don't have to waste space on taking those high q pics
---
dumb?
---
I got reported because I suggested someone be reported for being racist in chat. My name was my initials.
---
My dude im on a pvp server. This aint amateur hour here
---
I fought a Blood DK mirror match on Argus for literally fifteen minutes in Legion.  Dude tried to leave after ten but I didn't let him.  Finally won after another five.
---
GZ
---
I mean it sucks an all that names get
---
Reported cause I’ve had one or two get reported but for real,try a less immature name next time?
---
I've been saying this about retail since they nerfed cata heroics: "When failure is banished, victory is empty."
---
This is ancient and is all over the net since about 2005. This isn’t the only area either.
---
in his defence if that was the case, leaving it out of the suspension message completely defeats the purpose of the suspension
---
Ashbringer-EU
---
Sodapoppin was in the race for world first 60 so I understand why he would try to cheese.
---
There's that condescending classic attitude.

Go buy a lottery ticket, sheesh.

Sorry, I'll turn myself in for war crimes.
---
They gave him the reason for his report, not for his ban. He would know why he's banned.
---
Set loot to ffa, only help each other out when they're about to die, and kill your own mobs in relative vicinity of each other instead of focusing on the same mob. This is only worse than solo if you're grouping for multiple quests and one of the classes is a slow walker or one of the players sucks.
---
I say dumb to hide the fact that we actually love the song and we were singing it at the top of our lungs as we progressed through the world.
---
Theyre two very different games that will appeal to different kinds of people.
---
If youre someone who wants something a bit more fast paced, polished and streamlined, go with retail WoW. It's got hours and hours of easily accessible content that will keep you entertained for hours. It's got tons of fun Dungeons, intense PVP, and hours and hours of quests and adventures. 
---
But if you're someone who enjoys the journey as much as the destination, someone who values community and teamwork, and someone with a fair amount of patience, you'll definitely wanna go for Classic Wow.
---
My advice would be to try both and see which you prefer. With a month of subscription you can play both and stick with the one you enjoy more.
---
Stanklord posted on the sub earlier today, his account is suspended for some reason and his name will have to be changed
---
Was questing through darkshore and asked in general chat if anyone knew where a certain camp was. Naturally the first response is "get questie". If I wanted to autopilot through quests I'd be playing retail.
---
They're using the original client, which I suspect doesn't jive with the existing environment.
---
If you don't just point a space heater at your case while having [configured emacs to interpret rapid cpu temperature rises as "Fireball"](https://xkcd.com/1172/), then I don't know what the hell yall are even doing in this game
---
If guilds can clear rag with less than 40 people, people can fill those empty slots with non-meta specs. :)
---
I don't understand why players don't kill each other. This is PvP server for a reason. I would help mobs to kill that sucker.
---
I've only seen weather that was this noticeable in Wetlands so far. This was just a couple of minutes of very dense, low fog rolling through the valley. I've had rain in Westfall and Loch Modan as well, but nothing in Redridge or Duskwood so far.
---
Since when is tiny threat out? This last night? :) I used it on bfa but have been missing a threat meter in classic since launch! :(
---
I'll check tonight when I'm home.
---
As a priest what I would do is usually throw a renew on them and maybe a bandage. Both combined can bring the warlock to around 60ish%, give or take a little depending on their health pool. It saves a lot of mana throughout the run.
---
It's Sprint's network, so however fast Sprint is in your area.
---
Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep are probably the easiest
---
Using a quest item multiple times? Without turning it in?
---
which specific texture?
---
it literally says “violation: inappropriate name, actions taken: suspension, rename”
---
I’ve also seen a lot of people posting things on the AH at prices lower than the vendor would pay for them. Either, they’re being very nice and supporting the new crafting industries by providing low cost mats, or they like giving money away.
---
It's based on whatever damage you needed to kill the mob the last time. It gets more accurate the more you damage/heal stuff.
---
Awesome. I’ll definitely try them. Thanks for the insight. Now I just have to find some friends to play with😂
---
They seem to have a candle next to the guy on the right at least
---
I ve downloaded it too and locked my windows. How do i get into the commandlist for the addon?
---
So it be...
---
There is a separate addon called blue shamans that I just got and it works just fine
---
That was definitely a thing, you'd have people doing the /train emote to warn others of the incoming fuckery.
---
I don't think it has so much to do with what server type it is, I think it has more to do with the fact that ALL things take longer to do in Classic and you aren't TPing left and right or jumping on your flying mount and disappearing into the sky once you're done with what you came to do.
---
Even on a PvP realm I've had more random social interactions and plain banter with strangers than I've had in all of BFA and maybe even Legion combined, and I'm not even throwing hyperboles here. It's just such a vast difference is game design and their differences forces people to act in different ways. I used to think people were just more social "back in the day" or "times have changed"... turns out it was the game that changed and nothing else, people still wanna be social and there are still great memories to be created in World of Warcraft.
---
Yeah i wanted it to be like in the movie
---
How does that stuff work? Do you have to fish at a special place? Certain skill level?
---
Classicauradurations to see time on dots
---
Omnicc to make it see numbers on time left on that dot
---
&gt; try to pool as much rage as you safely can from one pull to the next
---
this is the advice I always give. its a gamechanger.
---
If I could draw like that, I would draw naked elf girls all the time.
---
Bro, if your gonna use a sports analogy to express your point. At least make sure it’s actually correct and not some dumb ass attempt like that. Basketball would have been the sport you’re looking for. Hell, soccer would have been a good one as well. 
---
Who made you the fucking gatekeeper of WoW and how it’s meant to be played. WoW is fine with giving casuals pieces here and there. Everyone who pays should have content they can enjoy and should be able to play that content in any fashion they choose. You shouldn’t be this angry about all this.
---
Classtimer is also pretty good
---
Great... Now it smells like 6 dudes and a candle
---
I can almost smell this picture.
---
My first memory of thunder bluff was raiding it with a random ally group and a level 60 undead priest mind controlled me and jumped me to my death. It was glorious.
---
being a rogue and pressing sprint only to see a node pop up 2 seconds later....
---
It also says "After a thorough investigation of the evidence, we have Suspended your World of Warcraft account." The name was why they were reported, the stuff they said in chat is why they're banned. Again, if it was just the name why can I go home and play?
---
Different strokes, I guess.
---
Is it possible for a macro to figure out what the current value is and toggle it to the other one based on that?
---
MonkeyQuest
---
How many people helped you ? I want to start it asap ,but :(
---
&gt;lTry and not get so offended.

Lol what? What makes you think I am?

Had similar experiences.

Group of rogues in general chat looking for help on their rogue quest bc they have to fight an Elite. As a mage, i offered the assist and we got through it together. I didn't need the quest, just thought i'd go out and help since i'm not doing anything else. He gives me like 20s! I wasn't expecting to be given anything, but, how generous!
---
People always ask me for conjured food/water, i always give em a few stacks. Sometimes i get a tip! Can't wait until i learn portals!
---
Love this game.
---
Clearly you have no idea what RPG means.
---
Awesome. Would you say that most players on classic are friendly with everyone in game?  Or would I have to try and get a group of my own friends to join up with to play?
---
I mean it might be little immature but I didn’t think it was this inappropriate
---
vanilla ran fine with everything maxed on my geforce 6800 gt.
---
I report every offensive name I come across. Easy gank
---
Go take a shower, nobody cares lol
---
"Carry me pls"
---
Reading this subreddit, it has taught me that a lot of people still have nightmares about it.
---
Oh god. I want to see this so bad. lol. Anyone have any videos? lol.
---
Honestly dude play a shammy. I'm having a ton of fun with it. And Yhea I'm also a filthy belf pally and never really played a shammy in old wow. I'm having a ton of fun with it now though it still plays similar to a pally but you are a fair bit more engaged.
---
How are you liking classic btw?
---
Which reminds me of the bug in L4D2 in Mercy Hospital where you can slip through the floor of the elevator and plummet to your death.
---
Are fucking serious? Fortnite literally added a Mech in the game in order for casuals to have a better chance at winning. Holy fucking shit. Is this real life right now. Fortnite is slowly pandering to casuals. It’s the biggest issue in Fortnite right now. You are trolling. This is 100% fucking bait.
---
Did they actually say uwu in vanilla?
---
True. But to get one of those crazy twink that had all the BiS gear from every quest, you needed a higher level partner to run you through quests at the lowest level you could pick them up so you didn't accidentally over-level.
---
Is it better than Questie?
---
Ill try it later when im at home, but ty sir. You ve saved my day
---
Thank you. Would you say that most players in classic are pretty inclusive with everything and social?  Or would I have to get my own group of friends together to play?
---
It's also because we remember the entirety of vanilla, while classic is a snapshot of the most nerfed version of dungeons with the most polished and overpowered versions of the classes.
---
A warrior in 1.0 was nowhere near as powerful and a wrecking machine as a 1.12.1 warrior.
---
Combine overpowered classes with overnerfed dungeons and you just breeze through most content with ease without ever equipping a shield as a warrior.
---
Sucks :(
---
How do they do that? Is some buff stronger?
---
I agree that it is a different breed of person, but it’s also (obviously) an entirely different game. A real MMO!
---
That could be really interesting assuming the balance isn't too crazy
---
well yeah but the joke isn’t saying they can’t, it’s just saying meme specs contribute less dps
---
They would still need to stick to the lore (not that I know the lore).  
---
OSRS and RS3 are also fundamentally very different games (OSRS is click to attack, RS3 has action bars like WoW). 
---
The same cannot be said for Classic and BFA.
---
The world chat groups for dm and stockades say otherwise
---
I've done it in the past. Mostly for RP reasons. When you're walking around named Cumshót, you're asking for trouble 🤦‍♂️
---
Lets start a sentence with a capital letter, should we?
---
Dude i did this on accident cause i was looking for a quest item that had chest in the name.
---
Now im sad because i realized what i did and cant atone for it.
---
Your the noob hunter I love the most. The ones that love cheetah so much it screws them over.
---
Yes, my biggest peve when playing a frost mage was running past their leash and seeing the dreaded “evade”
---
Was it on Grob or BB?
---
Should be around 75k takehome for the year. Unfortunately paying off a lot of credit cards, fortunately they are still in their 0 APR phase, but my wife and I managed to spend quite a bit on our wedding and honeymoon earlier this year. We are currently renting to save up to buy a house, but we are still trying to finalize if it will be in the city or not.
---
I play on more of a feast or famine type basis. Most days I haven't been able to play, but I've had a couple decent sessions. Excited to do my first dungeon group the next time I have a nice chunk of time I can dedicate to it. I also had to spend some time dusting off my old gaming computer and reformatting it. Generally speaking, I try and maximize my efficiency, as that is something I enjoy, even while being casual about time dedication. So I should be able to hit 60, but it also depends on how quickly they release the phases, I could see myself getting distracted with battlegrounds when they release, as running the flag in WSG as a druid in classic was one of my favorite memories.
---
I don't think you should get banned for it, but that's seriously some 12 year old humor name.

I’m level 41 I’ve been solo questing and grouping up with people along the way just minding my own business. I don’t say anything in general or /world other than looking for a group.
---
Improved Blessing of Might - 20% more AP iirc. They can also pick up Blessing of Kings, if your holy paladins fail to.
---
I think that's the war mounts. Not available in classic.
---
5/7
---
Maybe you should shut your dicksucker

---
WE HAD A DEAL
---
I had a healer spamming heals on my life tap. Told him to cool it a bit then he healed zero. Settled on healing under 50% unless I had agro. He didn't have the UI to see if I had agro so that was a bit of a problem.
---
Every level feels rewarding. Spending talent points takes thought (I'm not looking up a guide quite yet). Earning some of my spells feels amazing, you simply don't have that in BfA. 
---
I feel like I'm getting stronger with each level. In BfA, I was weaker at 120 than I was at 110 at the beginning of the expansion. That sucked major ass. Gear drops currently either are an upgrade or are money, which is hard to come by while you're leveling, since it all gets spent on abilities. 
---
I feel accomplished when I complete a quest or kill a rare. The only time I had this feeling in modern wow was the Mage Tower really. That was maximum class fantasy, and difficult as hell, and had a unique reward. 
---
Also the community. You *have* to group up to do some stuff. It's just not solo-able. Not so with basically non WQ bosses / rares. I spammed LFG for a level 17 rare in darkshore when I was level 13. Modern wow in my heirlooms I woulda solo'd it no issues. 
---
Professions have meaning as you level up. Right now in BfA professions don't mean shit until you're max. What you can make in BfA you outlevel so fast it's useless. Meanwhile I'm chugging minor defense potions because they actually help and will continue to until I learn the next level of defense potion. That's really satisfying, to make stuff you can use as you level, instead of never bothering because 1) your heirlooms are better or 2) you'll outlevel that piece so fast it's not worth it. 
---
There's more but that's been my impressions so far. It's about the journey. You're playing an RPG, and it really feels like it too. I love it.
---
Apparently the plot diverges a lot. The jack guy isnt in the show etc
---
You know it's not about difficulty, nice attempt at a straw man though.
---
I hope you had skinning
---
0 on ignore but many on friends. Go RP.
---
Im glad you did it tbh. This is an RPG, not retail.
---
gz, glad you are wearing the most important trinket in WoW :-)
---
Needs more JPG, repost it.
---
Was doing Gnomeregan with randons and in the last fight, our tank decided to say some beautiful and motivating words. If you read this post man. Just want you to know that people like you make this game even better
---
Believe me it is an umarmoured version. Similiar to this horse:  [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=2411](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=2411) 
---
The horse is bought in Menethil I think at level 40.
---
I know it is part of classic and it is for level 40 since i recently played 2 years of classic.
---
Nah thats not fair. People should act all elite towards people that use addons. If someone asked me for help on a q i wouldve helped them and then give them a heads up on questie being a thing too.
---
I think this is fair, but iirc renew costs relatively much mana.
---
Bruh, no one ever finishes the IRL grind
---

It’s like choosing between 2 different alcoholic beverages.
---
Grats dude! So he's spawning in multiple locations! That's really good info, thanks a lot. Does he patrol or just sit inside the ship/bunker?
---
how the do you have 311g?
---
Okay, trying Zygor now, looks really good! Seems very polished. Will stick with this and see how I go, thanks for the tip.
---
Renew, is all I'll give a lifetapping warlock...
---
I never realized how expensive and tedious it is to manage mana...without a mage.
---
I start my playing sessions now by grouping with a mage for whatever instance I'm leveled for. Yesterday I ended up going through SM, simply because I'm a cheapskate and needed water. If I have magewater, I don't care about using my mana to heal up any missing HP.
---
XP\H in dungeons is pretty neat anyway, actually considering running pure healing spec because of how much I enjoy grinding dungeons as a healer.
---
Not really but ok. Blood Elves could only be in the horde. They are greedy, completely addicted to magic, they captured a naru and enslaved it to help feed the addiction. They brainwash and silence their own people. They are really shitty people and the alliance would never have them. I get it though sucks that more people don't want to play trolls tauren and such.
---
The final raid of Legion has an elevator that kills you if you stand under it when it comes down.  They still have a sense of humor.
---
"Most" might be an overstatement, but you certainly shouldn't have trouble finding pleasant people throughout the world as you're leveling up.
---
That's fine :) I too enjoy toilet humor, but not in WoW name.
---
Lifetap becomes more efficient, it's not always 1:1.
---
Yeah, I started using it at level 22, and it kept saying I had like 800+ quests missing, couldn't fix it.
---
Ghost wolf doesn't get dazed? Immune?
---
Perfect. Looks like I’m gonna hop on classic tomorrow hopefully. Thank you
---
You get attack power from strength.
---
Why people don’t simple read the damn text!?
---
Whenever I level druid, I always modify whatever cookie cutter spec is out there to include the stealth talent. Makes life so much easier.
---
That's good news for me then, I loved doing alchemy in Vanilla and will enjoy it even more so now in classic. I like tailoring but aside from mooncloth and bags there's not as much fun/cool/useful things to make afaik. Shadowweave/Felsomething greens are good though.
---
Not useless, takes a lot more care than being a rogue which makes sense since you're not supposed to be as good as they are. If you're the same level as mobs you should be able to get by them given a wide enough berth.
---
Here's the tell: if a mob turns and looks directly at you, you're approaching discovery distance. The bubble around that is the proximity with which you can approach without detection. If you managed to get behind an enemy, you can open up on them, but if they turn and you're within that bubble you're aggroed.
---
That's honestly the main difference for me. Back when I was a teen and playing WoW, I was scared shitless about the future, thought I was just wasting my time and felt bad all the time. Now I just have fun playing, even if it's at the cost of things that are considered more valuable such as learning a language or whatever. Having the opportunity to experience this again made me value "wasting my time" much more, otherwise life is just a constant chasing for achievements.
---
No, but I think I figured it out. It basically told me that my ranged damage normally 24-45 was getting the spell power from my armor putting it at 49-65. Wands hit for white damage, not spell damage so the range damage number was just lying to me.
---
Is this suggestion for PVE? I stared leveling as a prot warrior and realized I fucked up at level 17
---
Meant to reply to the guy you replied to, not to you, my bad
---
Cheers mate that's awesome
---
you sir, are my new rogue idol
---
This is what every white cis male is thinking regularly these days, myself included.
---
There is a guy named spunktrumpet on my server, i wonder how long it will last.
---
Keep in mind you don't get vanish until level 22 (or 28? I think it's 22). So you're not getting out of combat using stealth until at least then.
---
Not an expert here but I think during leveling they don't recommend improved stealth because u mostly dont use it that much. Pull with ff and kill the mobs. No stealth opener so ur killtime is faster in total. But if u wanna play with your own style take the improved stealth talent.
---
All the racist bullshit chat and you get banned for that? Blizzard is lame as fuck
---
No time for the game still level 14 in Barrens 😂
---
Are you on an RP server?  They have stricter naming requirements.  I saw a rogue named something like Crityourpants on Bloodsail the other day.  Reported him for ruining my faith in humanity.
---
This comment applies to yourself more than anyone else - by a long way, little guy
---
Pretty sure the /who command is 'some kind of blizzard API call' via the wow client
---
Haha oh, well then thaanks!
---
The only thing I know about him is that "Asmondgold reacts to..." videos with his stupid face in the thumbnail keep filling up my youtube recommendations ever since I've started watching videos related to WoW Classic.
---
Ghost wolf is not immune to daze, but aspect of the cheetah is dazed with any hit.
---
I give all the casters I see water and tell them to stay hydrated.
---
Ran across a shaman and buffed him and traded a stack of water and he put 14 light feathers in the trade window. I'd been leveling in the undead areas so that was a treasure to me. I ran him down and told him I'd make him some food too as a thank you and he said he was about to heal a WC, so I gave him 3 more stacks of water and two of food.
---
I saw somebody with  this name on ashbringer horde side and lol’d
---
I read it, other then the Stan Lee painting being destroyed, it wasn't as bad as a lot of shit I see there regularly.
---
TLDR; sister ripped a Stan Lee painting OP made and got signed from Stan Lee, all because she wasn't allowed to borrow a jacket. Family took sisters side because she is such a hothead and OP a coolhead. OP asked for advice, which was to call parents out on the bullshit, OPs mom cried and asked for forgiveness. OPs parents having a talking to about behaviour.
---
i rolled a cigarette just then. they're pretty toxic. agreed
---
WoW classic patch is after a *lot* of nerfs were made to Molten Core.
---
here it is:

---
Around 260 medium leathers and a bunch of red whelp scales.  Thanks again!
---
The "easy" solution is to count X amount of times they did dungeons in a raid group and then they wont get XP in those X amount of dungeon groups. (Or maybe half xp)
---
Forcing them to either do dungeons with no XP, or just do quests
---
If any of the private servers were 100% accurate with mobs, you could just query the db and find out.
---
I had a tank in wc that had a 6.6 2h and the same excuse. Hit up a vendor man
---
Codex s tier
---
popping 3min cd to avoid drinking to buff and then drinking again.. worth it.
---
First put your epeen away, then go grind rep in EPL.
---
I was a lock and vanilla raiding endgame and never focused on stamina. Life tap costs time and therefor dps. The healers in raids or higher groups would easily outheal the life tap 'damage'. 
---
Having a lot of spellpower instead would make siphon life and drain life much stronger to the point where you had a nice symbiosis between mana and hp.
---
Granted I was an affliction lock allowed to use debuff slots. Maybe that was after they introduced 40 debuff slots instead of 16? Can't exactly recall.
---
Hmm ok, i dunno about these things. I began playing during the middle of BC.
---
Already 2g wtf how
---
I miss the boats so much. Never been a big RPer or anything. But It still takes a bit of the charm away from getting to from Teldrasil.
---
I think I was questing next to you earlier. Rattlegore server?
---
I kinda know which ones are mine but organically knowing how long it would take to warm off.
---
I rn SFK caus of this post and got Shadowfang in my first run lol
---
Regardless of that, there's no reason to defend Blizzard just because they did the right thing this once.
---
It's the same as in sports. 
---
The word PR (personal record) has exactly the word in it that you seem to miss: personal.  
---
I will never be as strong as  Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson or Eddie Hall, still I push myself even though I will never compete.
---
The same mindset can be applied to classic. Just because you will never be #1, because there is always a bigger fish in the sea, does not mean I can't push myself for my own sake and just against me.
---
I've got two chars at 10 and 11. Goldshire and Stormwind were the hub of roleplaying back then, always someone bickering or dropping jokes here and there and stuff like that. Sure, people group up to do a quest and throw a "thx" if you're lucky when helping. But that's not really what I'm talking about. That's like people just have a makro of lfg/lfm and thx+np.
---
Consider that even on reddit, the subscriber base of /r/classicwow is not a quarter of the subs on /r/wow.
---
Indicative.
---
It is when you're always opening and closing the game to install addons :)
---
More like datacrawlerware
---
I used both talent points and it's amazing. I have to walk through a mob or hostile player to break stealth.
---
teach me
---
Going to guess a while.  Private servers have thrived for years.  If they season classic too will be a long time as in every 2 years open a bunch of fresh servers with no transfers
---
Yeh probably, or you could try one of the other high level areas for quests, (winterspring and EPL spring to mind)
---
Fairbanks. Standard pvp server
---
That feel when you only have 5 Deviate Hides after a run because you are not melee.
---
Hehe, imagine getting mad at someones comment about someone else on the internet and being so mad you have to make a post attacking them.
---
where ?
---
Like I said, probably less than a 1% chance of happening.  But I know my luck, lol
---
 I found a video of the Mount: At 1 Hour 50 Minutes and 30 seconds : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhL7vfgpifc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhL7vfgpifc)
---
Hopefully we get entire new expansions with Vanilla gameplay. No flying mounts, no cross realms,  no LFR, keep 40 man raids, no DKs, no pandas, no MTX.
---
Gurubashi arena, done! 
---
All jokes aside, arenas got out of hand gear wise the same way tiers did with the expansions. I think, if arenas were to be introduced at some point it should reward non-gear items. Maybe a rep grind, or players choice of pvp consumables.
---
Flipping items on the auction house and buying all linenclothbags that are under 2s and selling them to a vendor.
---
Those recipes were never rare. I got one on every alt I leveled
---
On shamans, I level 1-60 exclusively with 1h/shield with agi/spirit stacking. I keep a 2 hander leveled up for when I need to defend myself, but that's the only case where I use a 2 hander.
---
At level 15, I would open with two Wraths, a Moonfire, rejuv or regrowth yourself if you're short on health and have the mana then jump to bear for kills. Save rage for a bash if the mob runs in fear, but otherwise maul to your heart's content. :)
---
Stop following the guide and go to another high-level zone?
---
Yes well many people have never played WoW before and are starting with Classic, so now they can see it for the first time!
---
They are in no way comparable, except you are correct that OSRS was bleeding subs before new content (and then more importantly mobile) came out. 
---
OSRS and RS3 are extremely different games (click to attack vs. action bars). People never wanted EOC; the ones who wanted action bars were already playing other MMOs. Or (like me and many others) were playing RS and WoW/other MMOs. 
---
Classic and BFA are not so different in styles.
---
I guess that was a misunderstanding: I'm comparing classic with classic, I basically never played anything different. 15 years ago lots of interaction, at the moment it's like everyone is muted apart from the looking for group chat.
---
I don't give a shit about BE lore. That does not matter. They made BE extra hot. Way more than was usual for Horde and that way Blizzard made Be the #1 horde dominated race. No contest. It is absurd and stupid. Tge make up of the whole faction was trown out if the window... not to mention that horde got paladins. One again TBC is dogshit just for these things. There are plenty more.
---
Go sleep and socialize a bit.
---
Yeah this is a common misconception. Others are: meeting stones able to summon and getting your mount at level 20.
---
Weak bait
---
Really? I finished wc,bfd,sfk,sm,rfk and I didn't need to do it, I'm rogue with blue items so my dmg is fine, zero problems with threat. I don't think it's possible to wipe in classic dungeons. So can we stop spreading this bullshit?
---
And yes I played on private server and on private server dungeons could be hard, not the case on blizzard server.
---
Is there any macro to show threat meters? The only decent one I could found said in the dev notes it only works with other people who have this addon
---
I didn’t really know what to name so I went with something silly. I’m not on an RP server so I didn’t think it mattered this much
---
I started a priest and got to ~20 and changed to warrior so I can tank dungeons for my guild
---
I usually use UC, once you learn how to navigate UC everything is actually pretty close. 
---
Not sure if you can fish in those waters though...or if you'd even want to!
---
Had a similar experience without the chest episode. This hunter wouldn't group up with me and two other guys waiting for spawn to kill Farmer Ray in Hillsbrad. He probably spammed a target+attack macro the whole, because as soon as Ray spawned, he had it tagged. He instantly went "ezzzzz" and when we told that he gained absolutely nothing from that and he was being unnecessarily rude he just said "nah, I'd rather you suckers struggle ;)" Like, why? We're on the same side dude.
---
Equip the Argent trinket and grind undead for tokens to turn in at Light's Hope Chapel.
---
Yeah they really messed up the talents. Why would a tanking ability be in holy.
---
If your network configuration changed, example: from Ethernet cable to WiFi, this will happen. 
---
I suggest you setting up a fix IP address to your machine.
---
Short answer: Yup. 
---
Long answer: Yuuuuuuuuuup
---
Grind mobs, buddy.
---
Ruining my otherwise flawless party frames.
---
I've done four dungeon runs where we've found chests so far. Only in one of them did we not roll to determine who got it.
---
If you want to tank, yes.
---
What unitframes are those?
---
For some reason the autoupdate of the app wasn't working. After reinstall it appeared, thanks!
---
Every graphical setting: Maximum  
---
Ground Clutter: Lowest possible setting
---
I keep saying, it's the community that makes classic so good!
---
It's totally me.
---
I never understood why it's called Xbox360..
---
I'm playing on a shitty laptop with intel hd graphics and that's how i roll
---
Ah, makes sense.
---
I only did stockades early on and then the next earliest dungeon I did was uldaman. In stockades I obviously waited every time simply because I can't stand at max range, but in uldaman, zf and maraudon what I wrote worked fine.
---
However keep in mind that it only works if the dps are coordinated, if everyone attacks a different target or for example there is a combat rogue in party who wants to sit in the middle of the pack to cleave then this doesn't work, 2 dps aren't enough to kill off one mob and in that case you are better off just waiting for threat.
---
Explain exactly what they did wrong and how you know better
---
Lmao, I play lock and this is EXACTLY how I fell.
---
I'm very familiar with quest paths and in which order to do them. Also I farm mobs very often because I like to just put music on the background and repeatedly kill mobs for a couple hours at a time. Additionally I go to trainers very sparsely (approx once every 10 levels) and disregard professions and quests that have long travel times.
---
Main thing is recognizing that very few quests give worthwhile xp/h due to long travel times.
---
\&gt; ..  then cancel it by moving, jumping, or pressing escape, before it finishes if it is unnecessary. 
---
Worth mentioning, there is a Cancel Cast keybind. Always worth getting used to using this, rather than moving, jumping or similar. Especially true in pvp.
---
My herb already 149 by level 21
---
Download questie -- it'll show you quests in high level zones you can pickup.
---
If you skilled cauldron runs in WPL, hit those up. EZ 1/2 a level. Otherwise you should have odds and ends to clear up in Winterspring, EPL, Silithus &amp; Burning Steppes. You can get started on attunments and stuff too -- albeit you probably can't do them fully without other folks at 60 to group with.
---
Not most of the time, what I said that it is easy for feral to be top dps, and in WoW it is very easy for circumstances to exist where a feral is top dps. Is a perfect 40-man raid with perfect hardcore raiders one of those circumstances? Probably not, but that is not what WoW Classic is 98% of the time.
---
&lt;3 in that case... FINISH EPISODE 11 :P

From my experience, you only get to get a whole bunch of pets once you hit 60. Pick a pet you like and keep that one. Keep a slot open for learning new skills, and then once you have learned all the skills you can tame whatever you want. On a positive note once you hit a high enough level and want a different type of pet, you can just find the highest rank skills instead of going level by level. But I do agree that it is inconvenient.
---
Learn (at a major city) and level first aid and stock up on food. Resources for first aid will come naturally when killing humanoids, just remember not to vendor any cloths (linen, wool, silk etc). Also warriors are gear dependant so if you can go into dungeons for upgrades, good gear makes a difference!
---
noooo

I do wish I could launch classic from right-clicking on Battle.net in my system tray like I do with Destiny 2(for now).

&gt; Pantheon Rise of the Fallen
---
oh daym, saw this a long time ago and forgot about it. Any news about release date?
---
I approve of this!!
---
The lower level stuff is being farmed pretty heavily right now, and mining nodes are hard to find since they're shared with everyone. Once the economy settles down or you get to higher level stuff it should be easier to make money.
---
Yet, they have a city called booty bay which sounds like the hoe capital of azeroth. Well done blizz /clap
---
Good luck when the initial hype dies down and thde current medium pop servers become dead and empty lol

What table is that it’s perfect

Hey! sorry for the late reply. I went from UC &gt; Silverpine &gt; Hilsbrad &gt; Marsh &gt; Loch Modan &gt; Dun Morogh
---
I have a laptop with a portable battery lol. Whooos.
---
That's usually how it works, yes. Be a dick and nobody will play with you or buy your stuff. Max level enchanting means nothing if nobody want to purchase from you.

How did god take Mankrik's wife and leave you behind?

Pretty much, yeah. You can't really have more than two permanent pets until you've mastered all the useful abilities.
---
NOT ME!!! PHIL!!!  lol
---
This is still better than the low res pictures people have been taking/recording with their nokia's.
---
 This bug was reported in beta many times, strange that it still occurs
---
Man, I can't imagine how many draconic children you butchered in pursuit of your new pet sentient life form. Bravo.
---
*Note: I have done this myself. Roughly the same duration. But that was back in vanilla.*
---
Do you really think the hype will be there in 3 months ?
---
The game is easy as fuck, the content will dry soon.
---
Hah I haven't paid attention to the levels of those players. Been assuming that those postings were legit.
---
Agreed! I feel grounded yet lost again. Its great!
---
I am having this issue as well.
---
I've tried at least a dozen different things: deleting my browser cache, changing my password, removing the "Starter Edition", leveling to 10 on classic, logging into a level 70 character that I had from TBC, waiting for a few hours, waiting for a few days, waiting for the  next update; the support people at Blizzard "reset" something in my account...
---
There are a few other things, but none of them fixed the issue. 
---
I still can't post, and it doesn't work on my phone's browser either.. are you using an app to get it to work?
---
The weird thing is that when I am on the old forums I can see the character selection screen. It's only when I get re-directed to the new forums that all I can see is my Battletag under the character selection drop down.
---
Well the fact that we have IF layers that dont have NPCs... layering is working as intended
---
Usually people with these sort of systems setup have been doing it for years in bfa and can sub for years for free with the amount of gold they’ve made.
---
No it does, this original covers 2016 as well
---
Half of those searches are mine, blizzard needs to send me a letter of thanks :P
---
There is no need for buying every spell. My mage still only has rank 1 Fireblast. With that said... you should definitely get Evocation. It is a life saver.
---
If you find ranged mobs annoying, I would recommend getting Mana Shield since it removes push back on physical Damage. Counterspell is great vs casters since they tend to nuke you down quickly.
---
I'll try the 1.5 speed dagger with a shield with windfury tomorrow. Guess I'll test it out on same level mobs and see what happens. Thanks
---
could you share the guide?
---
I recall having a 20 minute duel with another druid in TBC, it just never ends.
---
Because I have better things to do than decode vague quest text.
---
Damn dude... =/
---
We can tank too :(
---
I've tanked DM, SFK, Gnomer, and SM multiple times!
---
All you need is a shield.
---
Priests out there: Haven’t heard you complaining about the soulstone you’re rocking all day long.
---
Completely Different!
---
- Questie is a Quest helper which shows you where to go on the map
---
- MonkeyQuest is a replacement for the on-screen questlog
---
Pretty sure he lives in Azeroth
---
Added you (twitch jivon1), surprised to have some1 on my server :) lvl17 warrior orc
---
It's called 'Titan Panel'.
---
5 minutes to replace, another 10-20 until he gets there.... yeah might aswell finish with the shit dps...
---
At the end of the day it's going to take you till 40 to know if you enjoy the class.
---
Rogues are fun. But suck leveling alone.
---
Mages are fun and good ar leveling.
---
Warlocks are the best
---
Sure it was a boss fight? Maybe it's only for raid bosses.
---
Only buy spells you actually plan to use, or else you won't be able to afford a mount once you get there. For instance, you probably won't want to buy the fire spells since you should just be spamming Frostbolt for damage.
---
I hope it does pass with time. Was really looking forward to the dungeon runs from back in the day where people had to plan every second pull.
---
Wow now I look selfish ending each session standing by the gates of org buffing people running out for a few minutes.
---
I thought I was a saint! :p
---
Classic doesn't have a threat API, so those are the only addons that *can* work.
---
I love the Internet.
---
I think the dwarf strongholds in southern barrens and hilssbrad are good examples. Alliance are friendly to them, while horde need a group to reliably push through. Those places were amazing to hide in as ally rogue.
---
Nah a competent 4 man is better than a retarded 5

Players with herbalism trying to find that Golden Sansam are going to QQ. Possibly the hardest herb to spot, especially in the crater.
---
it's a meme template that starts with that scene [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jjzNsDAOgQ)
---
Nothing really, it's a bit more gear dependant since 4 hoursemen need a ton of decked out tanks.
---
But, Naxx will be cleared just as easily and not long after it will be cleared by pugs.
---
The only reason Naxx was not heavily cleared back in the day is because  Burning Crusade was near, and people were shit.
---
I’ve been playing this game for 13 years, I’ve seen a wide variety in names and it never crossed my mind this would be so inappropriate i’d be banned
---
Not enough to make it worth
---
I’ve never played it before. I’m a brand new player and im having a blast. I would consider myself casual and I’m going at my own pace. Loving the difficulty of the game and enjoying random parties in areas for questing. 
---
So far I’d say I got 15$ worth already.
---
Trust me I get it. I had a Warrior named cleavage for years  and all of a sudden got flagged. So I made it again using an alt code just cause everyone knew me by that name. 
---
Then literally a week later got flagged again. 
---
I put in a ticket and argued with a gm that Cleave was literally an in game ability and there’s hundreds of warriors across servers with that name and if I was gonna have to change it why shouldn’t they? He/She literally told me that unless people reported it they were fine. So I’ve given up on that name since then. 
---
Yet I’ve had a Deathknight since Wrath named “Mydkissmall” so idk. The reported system is seriously flawed.
---
Hakkars aids? Lol was in Org. When that happened .... both hilarious and cancer
---
If there is a line it doesn't mean you are not allowed to abuse it. It just means you are a shitty person. BTW it doesn't make you skilled, we all know how to tag abilities to mouse scrollwheel or even better use AutoHotkey programs.
---
My vanilla rogue years ago was called Shîtface. I had a problem and opened a ticket. Afterwards i suddenly got logged out and had to rename my char. I didn't know what happend and just spammed enter to log in...i got a random name for my rogue which was called Thicheaurn later.. Well no ban at least.
---
It's doable with a small group. The biggest issue is actually hitting the lv 40 Cyclonian with a low level group. I, a 35 druid, and a 39 rogue did it no problem for a 32 ish warrior. 
---
Just reach out to people. I helped 3 warriors kill Cyclonian today and I met them all while they were collecting items from trolls in stv for the quest.
---
i dunno... 16 moonfires would pretty much insta-kill you...
---
Blunt. He rolled a blunt.
---
Anywhere at any skill
---
2 weeks for me. 1 more to go!
---
It was changed in 3.3.3 from 30% to 15%. So I havent used the neutral AH yet so I dont know which figure they are currently using. This according to world of warcraft wiki notes section.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Auction_House
---
You're not an idiot,  but you are kind of silly for having two "tracking" profs on one guy
---
I've said this to a few people but if you enjoy the story aspect of games and want to get a good grounding in the lore before you start I highly reccomend picking up warcraft 3 and its expansion frozen throne, you can pick up both really cheap these days and the end of the campaign takes place shortly before the beginning of wow classic.
---
Brings up alot of good memories! Keep it up!
---
Would like to know too.
---
To be an exploit you have to get some broken advantage over other player. I don't know how that could be the case here.
---
A buddy and I were discussing this very thing earlier today.
---
I would LOVE for retail to get back to talent trees and social interaction. However, there are plenty of players who can't invest a ton of time and would rather have a more "casual" experience.
---
Where does Blizzard draw the line? Only time will tell.
---
Literally always when one arrives at the harbor.. the boat you need ALWAYS departs just before you can get on.

It’s not a straw man. One of OP’s arguments is that it will make finding Classic easier.
---
I despise those alliance filth. Disgusting
---
Is it worth it? No.
---
Not as a cat
---
Im currently a level 14 Mage in Westfall. I do feel slightly underlevelled for the zone, as ive now completed most of the quests and im having to level up to accept more. 
---
Does anyone have any advice for leveling in this zone, anything that should be grinded, any hidden quests?
---
This is a very civilized exchange of opinions.
---
Where is the shammy Kappa
---
For 15 years I've been playing now, and to this day, nothing in WoW makes me as angry as the WC ninjalooters. I just love to hate them with a passion. I hope whoever does this falls off the cliff in WC, forever.
---
Cast time though.
---
Jesus man, there are quests everywhere just go to cities around your lv to find them. Finished one area? Look for another level appropriate zone. Repeat if needed. Check online for map levels if need be.
---
U got an AH addon that shows what items are below average price?
---
Social life? I've already been shunned by all my family relatives and friends. Hell, my boss didn't even realize I had quit work.
---
Sometimes you just gotta go big dick.
---
Seems like some sort of unwritten rule on my server that we’ll let each other level and wait til we have some talents and gear to start fuckin each other up
---
Thanks! I did a lot of back and forth between those areas so I figured I'd just get it done on the way.
---
Greetings fellow Grobbulus Gnome Mage!  If you ever need bags or tailoring gear hit me up, Kinzey!
---
Fat hands.  Co should have read xp.  The rest was pretty clear imo
---
It provides a strong hook
---
Im on Kurinnax and even when pop is high never had a que
---
in 1.0 the answer wasn't always yes. Sometimes it was no because you pulled aggro 1 second ago and were lucky to not die. Or another mage just pulled aggro and did die and you do roughly the same dps as them.
---
In these cases it was usually wand for 20 seconds then spam frostbolt again.
---
It's a good thing to read up on how threat works. For heals especially, as healing delivers threat to all mobs evenly instead of to their target like damage does.
---
Greetings fellow Grobbulus Gnome Mage! If you ever need bags or tailoring gear hit me up, Kinzey!
---
Damn, I only have [Ice Cold Milk] in my inventory.
---
:D
---
Hey man what happened to your 12 days of classic posts? I loved those and now they seem to be gone
---
You're taking the different opinions and observing them as an adult would, very respectful.
---
not in lowbie zones
---
Why arnt people who arnt level 60 hanging out in major cities! Why dont I see anyone!
---
You do. You see plenty of people and your wrong for expecting to see 10 people at all times right now. You feel alone? Join a guild. Talk to people
---
Im really struggling between aoe grinding mage and a single target build. I understand the pros and cons, but are either one of them "right". I mostly do solo leveling and enjoy quests, but I also want to run dungeons (where I presume aoe cleave is useful?). I hate the idea of staying in one spot grinding. I want to explore and move onto the next quest. Is single target for me? Will I still be useful in dungeons? Any specific talents I should take if I want to do some aoe for dungeons/aoe grinding alongside a main single target build?
---
Thankks so much!
---
I’m sure. I remember I was thinking that “this is a bit dumb” because we downed him easily with this strategy. It was not a raid however.
---
Chuckles in warlock
---
The healer uses say 200mana to heal the warlock to full meaning the warlock gets a good 1700 mana out of his hp. Think of it as a buff you do. You cast a buff on your dps that cost 200 mana and their dps increases
---
If a certain area only has orange or red quests its time for you to go to a different area to continue questing. It won't be until levels 30ish where you get cross zone / continent quests where you are required to travel to complete quests.
---
Just remember there are always multiple zones where you can continue your questing. So far it seems you only did Eastern kingdoms and it might be time to experience and travel to the other continent to new zones.
---
If you have already travelled to orgrimmar for RFC then my advice is to go back to orgrimmar, go to the crossroads (big quest hub) and continue questing there, and within no time you'll get quests for areas like stone talon mountains, ashenvale and thousand needles.
---
Most important is to remember, classic is a whole different community than retail. Therefore in general asking questions ain't bad, and will often get a helpful reply. Furthermore say that you are a newbie, and someone might offer to lead the way for you, or go with you. Making friends isn't that hard, you just have to put yourself out there..
---
Good luck buddy!
---
Yes, we DO NOT want to play this game. Trust me. So please stop! You don’t know how much you do not want to play it.
---
Hey, it’s been a while since I played Horde, but if memory serves me right there are quests in the Barrens (Southern) for level 20+ and there is also some stuff in  Ashenvale (I think) and Stonetalon Mountains. I’m not sure about the level range for Thousand Needles though but there may be some stuff there as well. Ideally when you get into the upper 20s you want to head to Stanglethorn Vale to quest.
---
If you aren’t in a guild yet you should seriously start looking at joining one, if for nothing more than having access to other people at your level range to ask questions. Hope that helps. Sorry if my memory of zine levels is off, it’s been a long time since I leveled Horde.

If it's anything like the original, then [El's Anglin Reborn](https://www.elsanglinreborn.com) will be a tremendeous resource for fishing. I see it even has a "Classic" distinction  you can click on.

TBC for sure. Most people really loved this expansion, I really hope they go TBC-WotLK path.
---
Looking for Priest tips. Levelling mostly solo as a Priest but don't want to gimp myself by taking too much damage or whatever because I want to heal in dungeons later on. WoW newbro btw.
---
There's honestly no secret. I got ahead of the pack and I'm a very efficient grinder and can figure out quests quickly and map out a route in my head of how I want to attack an area. I didn't use a guide and I haven't played horde since 2005 or 2006. At 52+ go to brd tho my man. Worked wonders for me all the way to 60.
---
Any add ons recommended for tank warrior / ui /dj? Not sure if Elvui works..
---
No, but I know that those bags sell for 2s at the vendor and just buy all below that price. But Auctionator got a modified version that works with classic, which definitly helps in the process. Hope you can also make some profits with this :D
---
Pretty much the main QoL thing I miss from retail. I'm half blind. So finding some of these items is such a pain for me. Took me almost an hour to finish eastvale logging with how much the wood piles blend in. May have to try the macro someone posted to quick change this setting. Could seriously help me.
---
I've installed Peggle but it only loads up when I refresh UI and I'm unable to actually start playing, how do you start the game? I press help and nothing happens
---
But when rolling on a pvp server mages are prolly the weakest class in open world surprise pvp
---
Did you farm the wicked claws yourself? Mind I ask what mobs you had success farming them off?
---
If you're gonna refuse any retail stuff then use wowhead with a thotbot reskin.
---
I did the same, forgot to get the TB flight path before running to Org and UC, set my hearth at UC, then started back to TB. Just sat in Org for a minute or two berating myself and trying to find another solution giving up and making the run again. And I forgot Crossroads both times I passed it, so I still need to go back there at some point...
---
Lesson learned though.
---
Get a good wand, it's good damage for no mana.
---
Played vanilla in 2006. Literally still had to ask how to join LFG channel. This isn't even down to modern wow, since I got bored and quit on Cata launch day.
---
Some ppl salty. Oh well. He's right I needed a shower though, only had two since launch lol.
---
That's how you tank pre 60 anyways. I only swap to sword/board if shit is getting real. The rest of the time I'm in 2h for that sweet threat generation. Warrior tanks pre 60 are essentially DPS.
---
Sounds a lot like you're also leveling by grinding? Or do you quest inbetween your farming sessions? Just curious, because grinding seems to be quite viable at times when questing zones are tedious.
---
5 reeten
---
I've not had this issue after the starting zones. Even opposite faction respects my claim to the chests and herbs. Rudest that happen is people skinning mobs I'm still killing, but that's on me for not waiting to loot untill I kill everything.
---
God these people in the comments are so toxic
---
Can't wait to see BWL cleaned in 2 hours
---
Fenris Island is like this. Especially in the keep area. So many Gnolls. And then there's the level 24 Elite warlock at the top.
---
&gt;blizzdrone 
---
You can do both. That's the beauty of pvp servers. Also what u/SwitBiskit said, I play on pvp servers not because I want to pvp, but because without the game preventing enemy players from attacking, those interactions where they are total bros are so much more. Totally worth getting occasionally ganked.
---
Contact blizzard in the morning.
---
&gt; My point is that saying ferals can't ever hit top dps is just as false  as saying that ferals are the best dps class in the game.  
---
No one is saying ferals "can't" top a dmg meter theyre saying that if they do theyre playing with bad players. Ferals aren't just 10% worse than an equally geared rogue and thats the point you're missing. 
---
I honestly dont care if a friend wanted to play feral druid but if they had prospects of raiding they should be aware that most guilds will have a feral druid low on the totem pole for gear.

Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you’re unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don’ts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE and 1 City. Days are finalized to be Mondays and Tuesdays, 7-10 PM Central Time. If you cannot commit to those times, we have a second raid roster on Saturday and Sunday 7-10PM CST. However, for both rosters we have a dedicated wPvP day on Thursday 7-10PM CST. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can’t roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for wPvP attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit
---
* A friendly tight-knit group who share a common interest in classic and other games
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won’t stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Someone who’s friendly, willing to learn, communicative on Discord, and loves world PvP
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla – you’re welcome, and you’re wanted.

#RECRUITMENT STATUS: OPEN
---
Solo questing dagger is really gimped, combat swords/maces with riposte is excellent when levelling.
---
It’s a shitpost, doesn’t matter what you put in the title.
---
OP may be the biggest fedora tipping neckbeard I have ever seen on reddit.
---
I’d get the Questie addon. It’ll tell, and show, you everything you need to know and highlight quests that are not recommended at your level.
---
You lose all progress, if you get skinning again it starts at 1.
---
Lmao, is the game dead. This guy.
---
what?
---
Rogue
---
He sat inside the bunker, can’t tell for the ship it was a tight earth shock tag lol
---
Affliction is low threat but mana intensive. It helps to stack spirit (life tap makes spirit worth double since your mana and health regenerate quicker). Improved cookie and the 15% stamina are a must however, improved cookie is almost always an at level healing potion and 15% stamina really means more health (even at the cost of precious spirit). 
---
If you have a pocket healer, destro until you get intensity for hellfire is the strongest aoe build for awhile. Stay away from Ruin however, its not great without +crit gear. 
---
I would get 7 points demonology, 7 points to improved lifetap, then 10 points for Bane, the rest comes down to your leveling style, for strictly solo questing, Affliction up to 70% drain life setback resist; for dungeon farming, destro up to Intensity.
---
One is free the other requires a recurring subscription.
---
This holds true in general, but I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Insecurities and weakness are nothing to be ashamed of, but people feel as though showing any sign of changing their mind or approaching new things will leave them open to attack and wind up lashing out.
---
Best defense is a good offense type of thing.
---
Never have, never will.
---
Agreed
---
Yes, even as a cat. In classic you get 2 ap per str in cat, and 1 ap + about 0.05% crit from agi. (Those are at 60, not sure if it changes before then, the crit from agi probably does) Str is worth more dps point for point.
---
Cool thank you. I have one more Q:
---
So you can only tame your level and below, and the pet will be the level of the creature you used tame beast on right? Why don't people just tame a new creature that's their own level instead of keeping their original ones? The only reason I could think of is that down the line pets start to out level the character, but I'm still pretty low so that hasn't happened yet.
---
This would suggest that instead of saving up one pet, you could just tame a new one at your le
---
I appreciate the way you put that. Well done.
---
I accept it, but I think there is growth to be done regardless
---
It seems that Elvui has been adapted for Classic, you can download it on their regular website.
---
Don't know if it makes it really useful to tanking though.
---
Water breathing and detect invisibility are a thing. I do that.
---
As a Frost Mage myself, this is very accurate.
---
&gt;Skinning* is worse.
---
*Skinning not shown due to test skinner still skinning in the previous zone*
---
Fill it up with Gloom Weed and have a toke.
---
Soullink warlock here. Dont heal me. I am immortal anyways
---
Go download the Questie add on. It shows you quest that are available all around azeroth for your level.
---
wow an epic hilarious and original meme that i totally haven't seen posted 15 times in the past year
---
Interface options &gt; names &gt; show guild names.. i believe
---
Grind your way through mobs to the quests, because walking with full mana is a waste of potential :)
---
If you're a hunter or warlock, don't miss a single mob, it's ridiculous how effective grinding can be between quests with that classes
---
On the other hand, I have seen players just needing on things because its cloth for instance. I reckon a need is a need, but im more in for taking the loot over in group before you roll.
---
It's definitely been my favorite experience while leveling, it brought back a lot of memories of other escapes. :)
---
Game design happened.
---
The playerbaae didn't magically become more selfish and entitled in Retail. Blizzard decided to encourage those traits through their game design.
---
Now that we are back where we were 15 years ago, with the same mechanics and design as before, the community is quickly adapting again.
---
Game design shapes player behaviour.
---
snitches get stitches
---
Ah BRD, I see, thanks for the tip!
---
This is why I supply my enchanter. He's a healer and I'm a tank, so between the two of us we get plenty of green BoEs. I'd rather have free enchants than the bits of silver that I could get from the AH.
---
No shame in that at all! Enjoy the game! I sure as hell was stressed the entire week lol.
---
In classic you tend to need to travel between zones. At your level you might want to hit up Loch Modan to do some questing there before returning at around 17-18 to continue westfall.
---
Keyring was added in 1.11.0 iirc, not sure why it's not in Classic...
---
I was writing something about your mouse clicking, then I realize it is great moment because of it. Love it!
---
Its not an exploit
---
I brought this up countless times during the beta and stress tests and pointed out these exact flaws that we see now.
---
Dodging pvp/respawning mobs/respawning profession items et.c.
---
Blizzard knowingly put this in the game and didnt add any barriers like only being able to switch layers in a town, adding a cooldown on layer switching snd more.
---
Its a feature not a bug and since it was obvious that this would be used to gain an advantage and blizzard still kept it as it is I don't see how you could ban anyone for it.
---
This just comes down to the way their build system functions. It’s not going to happen. It provides zero tangible benefit from a development POV and likely complicates their development process.
---
Why share the loot 😂😂🙂
---
There is a town called Crossroads in the Barrens. Its filled with quests, go get em tiger.
---
But those are things Holy Palaladins should have. You just coordinates who goes for which one.
---
WeaponSwingTimer is quite helpful even if it's just used a reminder to attack in case one of your abilites does not trigger auto attack but you can also use it for fancy stuff like hopping in and out of melee range just for a swing.
---
I think that's the only essential addon for regular dungeons while leveling. Of course once you're raiding you need stuff like DBM and ClassicThreatMeter.
---
Shit I've been killing them because they die in one hit and you can begin skinning them the instant they die because of no loot.
---
Ahaaha I did not even know they joked about making them 5th race, that is cool.
---
For me that would be Storm Peaks, but GH is up there for sure.
---
At lot of people beat me to 60, but I'm the first shaman to 60. I found out from the /who sham 50-60 command. All the people racing were keeping tabs on each other. We all played a ton this week.
---
The money you earn through grinding... Mount at 40 fix.
---
It's weird, because in a lot of ways retail is less casual than classic in really fucked up ways. You can passively play classic and just log in to do shit and it'll be fun, whereas retail is like a part time job if you want to keep doing fun shit. You have like 12 things you gotta do that week or you're behind on whatever. It's a hard game to just play unless you're in with a guild of active players that don't give a shit.
---
The thing is, people don't know how bad of a slog it. The WQ rep grinds are so much worse than any grind in classic, because they're just so fucking mind numbing. You can at least get good at farming mobs or whatever. Watch Preach's fresh account series if you want to see what it's like to play retail as a casual raider that pugs content, it's horrific. They raid more than mythic raiders and get absolutely nowhere, because every wipe has half the group leave.
---
I feel like classic has a superior casual experience that's kinda lowkey and retail has the appearance of being good for casuals, but there's so much required busy work and shit that makes the game difficult to enjoy properly that it's basically bullshit.
---
The problem is people see systems like no group tagging in classic as "hardcore", when in reality it's pretty much the opposite.
---
I just hit level 35 and I'm a bit confused about zone level ranges and quest density/difficulty. Arathi was supposed to be a level 30-40 zone but it had only one quest I could do at 34, the rest were orange or elite. Hillsbrad is 20-30 yet it had a huge bundle of quests for me to do at 30, and now I'm on the way to Desolace which I was told I shouldn't start until 35
---
How do I figure out the zones like these where their suggested levels aren't really the levels you should go? So I'm not running into 40-50 zones or 50-60 ones and finding the same problem?
---
Yes he can and it takes forever and he's a speed leveler not wanting to lose 1st place and he's just asking if there's a faster alternative he overlooked.
---
I reached 60 27h ago and had the same issue, all hunters do.
---
You seem... let's just say below average IQ.
---
Also new but I’ve been leveling using power shield, and just sanding. Up around level 20 and auto attacking with wands out dps most of my spells
---
For real. The whole idea of buying drugs online is that it’s anonymous. OP is definitely doing it wrong.
---
They drop basic mob loot at best. There’s a quest to zap them and basically makes them non elite mobs
---
Transfer servers
---
My char got reported and forced to rename for being called „Merkel“ on a german realm 🤬
---
Yea I don't mouseclick normally that was just full panic mode engaged haha.
---
House keeping and chores? Paying bills and making career plans? Calling friends and families? Not everyone can afford a peace of mind. Most adults are always going through changes in one way or another.
---
Use it on what, heroic strike? Nah, tclap is good.
---
swords/combat spec is much better for solo leveling... but you do lose quite a bit of World PvP potential. still able to kill people most of the time though, just not quite in 2 hits like with daggers :P
---
This. I was planning on doing/tanking mostly dungeon runs starting with WC but I did that place twice and that was enough. I'll do some quests and do SFK. My first run a rogue kept ninjalooting and had worse DPS than me with a level 6 1h axe+shield. To pour salt on the wounds if there was a serpent bloom and I wasn't clearing to it he would just go ahead and pull...even if we already pulled in the other direction. The next run I did had a warlock that didn't understand letting the tank pull and LOS. The final nail was on the last big pull before the final fang boss  I was pulling the druid to the right of the entrance, got a nice clean pull and the warlock dots the other pack and that in turn pulled the patting thunder birds. Really hoping SFK goes better, at least it's shorter.
---
Thanks, but I’m not the one struggling to interpreter a paragraph.
---
I miss lock howl of terror
---
He should get off reddit and grind then if he’s speed running, and he lost 1st place by quite a bit bud haha
---
This happened to my on the zeppelin the first time i created character as undead to run at orcs starting are to level with my friends. I went up the tower in Brill and as soon as i got there the zep started to move, i tought i could make the jump and i jumped on the bags hanging on the sides of the zepp, the very last bag. I was so happy i didnt miss my ride \`couse 4 of my friends were waitting for me.
---
This is such a massive non-issue tho, really.
---
How long do you think it would take for the servers to become stable and que times be gone, a month?
---
It has nothing to do with me personally.
---
I have been playing Ret in raids, and Ret dont even use the twohanders for PvE if you are going for top performance. The PvE weapons would be Manual Crowd Pummelers and something like an Ironfoe/Flurry Axe with spellpower stacking.
---
I am only arguing out of fairness because it makes absolutely no logical sense that Warriors should get priority. I basically see it as Warriors telling me that it's more important for them to have fun outside of raiding than it is for me to have fun outside of raiding. There is no actual justification for letting Warriors have priority on this.
---
The only exception would maaybe, be to let Warrios have priority on something like Bonereavers Edge, just because Paladins dont really benefit that much from the armor reduction debuff. But thats really the only exception I can think of.
---
Combat swords
---
Grind the owlbears in WS that's what I did and what Joana did too before silithus quests appeared. It's gonna take a looong time though and you're probably gonna lose your place if you don't have a good advance (I got caught up by a 5 man party right at lvl 59 that was infuriating)
---
Good luck, you're gonna need it.
---
Hardly a glitch...this is a bit dramatic
---
Maybe in the minority but I like the whole elemental melee dps thing. It's unique and cool.
---
Just a newbies opinion :)
---
You should hang out with people above 16

It's the grey kodo. Look at his cast bar when he mounts up.

Holy shit! I did exactly this on my gnome mage in vanilla! Congrats!

Where is the shadow priest
---
Thank you!!!
---
My first wand was a LMW that a guy was giving away. I was so happy I gave him all my 38c even though he didn’t ask for it
---
No also there are many dwarfs already
---
40-50% of dorfs are priests
---
I cant say that for certain, but i think most mobs just do regular damage so you better prioritise using the points on the necessities.
---
Obviously
---
Imagine being this autistic.
---
The more you’re set, the less likely you will spend your spare time to play games because the same time is now much more valuable as you become more proficient at whatever you have been doing.
---
Something with big top dmg
---
Will do!!
---
I don't think we know any numbers since blizzard stopped releasing official numbers a long time ago, but it's more than 1 million for sure. I remember when all servers were full and someone counted together all the people waiting in queues and it was like over 300,000 people in queues across all servers. Even recently in EU still had over 150,000 people in queues when another one added up all the queued people. So then you check the full server, probably around 12,000 people or so per server. That would be maybe just as much people logged into the game. And not everyone is playing at the same time. I would estimate between 1 and 2 million maybe.
---
It’d be fun for a day, 5 at most. Then rollback
---
Yeah, that's pretty much been my policy on answering most questions about directions: Read the quest. That and telling them they need to wait for the respawn on named mobs, not like there aren't a ton of other players doing the same thing or anything :\\
---
Ohhh.. yeah, I reread it and I kinda missed your point.
---
I mean, there is gonna be some difference of course, and also we have to remember that there are a LOT of retail players currently trying out Classic because it's the latest thing and there are people who think going super hardcore and reaching 60 ASAP is the only way to play the game, so player mentality will be all over the place.
---
But with Classic released we're closer to how player interactions were 15 years ago, atleast from my own personal experiences so far in Classic. I guess it comes down to what people you're lucky to bump into right now.
---
Yup. 
---
`C_FriendList.SendWho("filter")`
---
Don't think having up to ten was a bug, just the xp awarded was higher than it should have been for ten man groups.
---
Cries in priest
---
Was added in a couple of days ago. :)
---
The addon menu says its out of date :/
---
I've finally given in and installed Questie :(
---
But I only want to use it in case I would've opened a browser and googled for the quest.
---
What's the best way to quickly toggle Questie on/off in game?
---
Experienced player looking for leveling group and dungeon partners! I raided pretty hardcore during BC days and then left the game. I played a warlock and DK tank originally. 
---
I am currently playing a holy priest with plans on healing at 60. I'm roughly level 12, West Coast USA playing Horde on Pagle - I plan on playing pretty late st night 11PM PST onward nightly. 
---
If your interested in hanging out hit me up - Calaaj#1772
---
I mean, they hotfixed it.  
---
People abused something that wasn't intended.
---
That's what exploits are.
---
One of the simplest joys is seeing the same name from your questing adventures, while back in stormwind licking your wounds and stitching up bandages. Hey, it's actually a world out there.
---
I think you are assuming a lot when you say your standards of living will never change until 65 and 1.45mil is going to last you from 65 until you die lol. But hey, your life.
---
Not very much you can do to avoid it. They designed it so that you'd bounce back and forth between zones so you wouldn't get bored of one zone. Remember 10 levels of westfall is like 1 day, while 10 levels of desolace can be 2-3; very boring. Your two options are really to hit STV which has a pretty linear ride or download an addon like questie which generates an efficient route through the zones.
---
I thought it was bad I ran across someone multi-boxing with three toons the other day.  They were doing that old trick where the first one was actually completing the quests and the other two were just on follow...  I don’t understand it but to each his own I guess?
---
Had 3 100 rolls so far at lvl 25.  Mates think I'm hacking
---
Hi fellow levelling mage, I too also ran into the same conundrum as you when I was at lower levels and deciding my talents and so I just went with the AoE ones just to see how it was like. I don't regret my decision because the reduced CD of frost nova and 90% slowdown movement speed of your blizzard is just great. You can also use techniques for AoE grinding in your day to day questing like if you have to kill 6 wolves at once etc. etc. The AoE build starts to shine at 30 though once you get all your talents and figure out how it works. Suggest you try out AoEing while levelling and then single target for end game raiding after
---
**Hunter Feign Death &amp; Pet Glancing Blows.**
---
Feign Death is complete garbage, using ANY type of movement (even holding down right click) will cancle the effect and you won't leave combat at all. Additionally: After using FD, you have to stay dead on the ground for almost a second before you leave combat.
---
These combinations, even using the proper macros (petpassive &amp; petfollow) end up in a 90% failrate on feigndeath trapping other players in pvp. 
---
**Hunter Pet Glancing Blows.**
---
Mobs even ONE Level higher, will take glancing blows from the hunter pet (reducing the damage up to 50%).  
---
I don't even wanna talk about 2-3 levels higher, my level 39 pet hits lvl 42 mobs for litterally FIVE DAMAGE PER HIT.
---
It's litterally impossible to level as a hunter.
---
I noticed that too with the pet zig zagging trying to chase a moving target and only getting a few autos off. Everything feels really sluggish right now. Its a real shame because right now I'm in my 30's debating if they will actually fix all of these issues by the time I've made it all the way to 60 or if i should play another class from level 1 to have an enjoyable experience. Its a real shame because i fell in love with hunters after playing on private servers, only thing that comes close is a mage but it just isn't the same feeling.
---
I believe that the imp does more dmg, but the succubus has cc
---
I swap to Mograine the minute it was created, at 19:00 pm on launch day, I moved to a new server, just as Blizzard said. Not my fault it got overpopulated after that. I'm not even mad, sure, I want to play but if there's a q I just wait or play something else.
---
People subbed to play the game. That doesn't happen on retail, like at all. Their sub purchase system crashed, because so many people were wanting to get in.
---
I have literally never had a queue on Moon Guard, a server that is "full".
---
I do crippl mh in case of running humans
---
And insta offhand
---
Or double insta
---
That's the one.
---
"Buhuhuh people don't play the game the way I want them too"
---
No one cares.
---
Yes true, but no one will play with more than 5 now. 55% exp instead of 140%? Nah.
---
Hehe it happen to my with warlock @ wow original too , fear/nervous = mouse click
---
In the future make a macro that says 
---
/target (mob name)
---
/cast (instant ranged spell)
---
Then just spam it.  I use it all the time for long respawn named mobs.
---
LOOK AT THAT PACE.
---
😡

Uhh take care the master has arrived

My friend did the same thing. Wait till the payment goes through. Took a few hours for him.

Ergohuman. Check it out.
---
Welcome to our caster only club
---
I mained shaman in retail for a short period, mostly because I've always been fascinated with the idea of a caster tank. So now that I'm playing the version where shaman tanking has been it's most viable ever I'm practically giddy. It'd probably be the only class that I'd instaroll from anything to.
---
My whole job on Rag was standing in range of the warlocks so I could be their mana battery.  0% overheal.  I regret nothing.
---
And here I am, intending to play both. Gonna be a hell of a grind
---
Well. This game has survived time for 15years with subscription. If that alone does not convince you to get it, i do not know what would.
---
I would argue that the abandonment of the guild model was another HUGE change for the worse.
---
Not only did LFG make it less necessary to team up with your guild. At the same time, the guild finder feature languished to the point of uselessness, and the promising "mentor guilds" idea ended with the Blizzard person in charge being reassigned quietly.
---
here's an old post with a longer rant:

---
That's sharding.  Phasing allows two players to be in the same zone but have it look different based on quest progression.
---
Will it? Did the pservers just have the wrong values?
---
As a prot warrior, if I see someone in trouble with 2+ mob, I don't care about the mob level I charge right in and taunt and try to get aggro of most mob on me. Sometime the guy doesn't stop and continue running and I die, but most of the time they turn around and fight with me.
---
I don't care if I die or not in the process, I just hope than someday, the same guys will save others or myself. Fighting 2+ mob at ounce is hard and I know it as a war
---
I got a dagger with +1 frostspell damage in green as a mage on lvl 10. Is it worth to learn using daggers to use it?
---
&gt;not happening before it was heavily publicized
---
literally happened in beta already? obviously you get this kind of stuff when a bunch of m+ players go into a dungeon, looking for the fastest way to clear it. if it turns out that its really good xp/hour the news will spread and everyone will want a piece of that. i  dont see the point in blaming streamers for the behaviour of the playerbase.
---
now I imagine there being a bunch of horde players chasing him to the ship.
---
Retail on suicide watch
---
Leatrix Plus can do that
---
He might've been sent to Swamp of Sorrows, Blasted lands or Deadwind pass. They're all close to STV and much higher level.
---
How do you make sure you don't get in too early and get booted for being afk? Just checking it often?
---
Meeting stones can’t summon people in vanilla. That functionality was added latter.
---
It's not to summon people in vanilla/classic though. Summoning via the stones was added in TBC and thus isn't in classic either. But in vanilla you could auto-group through meeting stones and inn keepers. However this feature isn't currently in classic.
---
That's not their question and you can't use them to summon. That was added in TBC
---
The free 110 Boost for Retail when reaching 60 in Classic is all you need to understand that Blizzard won't do this. 
---
They want players on both and by offering / easing access to retail + classic with one sub a separation wouldn't be beneficial. 
---
Besides, it's okay how it is now imo.
---
Can you still do wall jumping or was that a vanilla only thing? Because I love wall jumping!
---
I joined bloodfang or judgement I forget which on EU. Both low pop and were only medium last night between 7 and 9 when all else was full
---
More than most new MMOs that launch...
---
This looks like so much fun! What classes did you all play?
---
As of WoWhead:
---
You can use multiple elixirs as long as they don't share the same effect.
---
Alchemists do net get a bonus from their own creation.
---
I had the most noob moment the other day. Afkish running through Darkshire to hand in my quests and ran into Stiches the level 30-something elite mob that walks the path, insta-gibbed.
---
An hour or so later, I see Stiches chasing someone down to also kill.
---
Hilarious!
---
Hold shift
---
I can't find the change in the 3.3.3 patch notes, though a lot of AH changes were in there so it would make sense if they changed it that patch.
---
I can definitely say it is not 30% on classic though, or I would have made much less money than I currently have.

Scate on that window dude!

/golfclap
---
Well this idea alone would ruin the whole “as close to vanilla as we can get” 
---
But I’d be okay with it if it had its own titles / sister gear (same stats different tints) and was equally as difficult to achieve as high warlord / grand marshal. 
---
I personally loved how arenas played. So long as no one was trying to cheese their way to victory. (Dampening) and think it would be quite something. Fun to excitement with.
---
The thing with the arena in STV that makes it less appealing is the fact there’s nothing to LoS with. Being able to put play your enemy by using LoS adds another dynamic to the game I personally enjoyed.
---
Due to how weapon skill works, all melees do have problems finishing off a single enemy of equal level sometimes because not a single swing will hit for a time. That's why you usually spec into combat first, because it gives you 5% it chance in the second tier
---
You mean using a game mechanic?
---
Yeah report them playing the game as intended.
---
I have my char and my friends on Gehenas, created backup chars on Bloodfang as well. We are simply waiting for Blizz to do something about it, release free transfers anything. This game got so frustrating to the point of I don't even want to play my main since I don't know if we gonna reroll or whatever. If we come back after 1-2 PM, you have 0 chance on logging on the server for 4-5 hours. If you come from work at 5-6, that day is compromised. Even TW, isn't a viable option for many reasons.
---
Bottom line is, half of us play while other half stays in the queue or on Bloodfang.
---
You sound like a fucking loser then. Flip your scenario around and ask who would waste time playing with a drama-queen who makes each run take twice as long because he insists on wiping when minor mistakes are made.
---
I just boght my mount. I farmed the insects in the south west shimmering flats.
---
As if you would delete valuable items to empty the chest. If the inventory is full it's full.

but the foliage animates when you walk through it!!!!!!!

What game were you playing?

Everything max including the good water

Rank 1
---
they gotta kill the time between the endless runs from one end of the zone to the other man. what better way to spend it than bashing the common enemy.
---
The guy in question even already had WF, too.
---
Also for some reason, female night elves prefer to hang out in gold shire with humans gnomes and dwarfs rather than with fellow night elf :(
---
&gt; warlocks have plenty of self heals

Make sure you tell them that.
---
I wonder what it's like to be as retarded as you, do you wake up and smash your head against a wall every day
---
Dude you gotta be kidding me
---
No offense but you are one of those ppl that gave us this personal trash loot in retail

If you want something Need it  nothing else matters

If $15 is too much to test the waters then I suggest it probably isn’t for you...

You’ll spend more on junk food or drinks or other shit and not worry about it.

Give it a go, if you don’t like it then it’s only $15.
---
i did observe many interactions during npc waiting lines, dungeon lines, or just basically general chat jokes. hack you can even literally approach to any place with many ppl like "i have no friends pls" just for sake of joke and get many friends. 
---
it's internet. getting friends is the easiest thing
---
Congrats man! 
---
How would you rank enh vs ele for the leveling experience (effectiveness, solo quests, world skirmishes, dungeon, overall fun)?
---
What are your gameplay plans now that you are at the holy 60 (content and specializations)?
---
Nah, you're just a bit of a douche.
---
I don't mean to discourage you and maybe this doesnt matter to you, but 6 months from now those are dead realms man.
---
9-5 is pretty hefty in my book i start at 6 and go home at 14-15 so i don't need to wait very long later on the queues rise to 45min or 1h arround 20 its the hardest because all people are ready to play then.
---
Waiting 15-45min as medium time is fine for me gonne get lower once more people stop playing over the next days/weeks
---
I was going through Uldaman as a priest. I told the party to wait while I drank. They ran off and a few seconds later they run back into the room that I was in and they are followed by a chain of Dark Iron Dwarves. We of course died.

I play on US realms from EU. I avoid most of the queue due to time zone differences! I log in around 4pm and maximum I've gotten is 3k.

Hunter is for sure the best class to get to 60 first well idk but u can make so much gold in Mara to gear ur alts

Max but foliage at 7.

Why don't you play on another server together? I mean, It's not fun like this.

“Rushed to 60 as fast as I could...”
---
Mistake number 1.
---
What have you gained from being 59/60 ahead of everyone else?
---
Every time me and the two friends I was questing with realized that we needed 15 each of an item with a 25% drop rate we would sing the first few lines.

Similarly, everytime we zone into stranglethorn or stonetalon (stonetalon is full of horde on my server) one of us starts acapelling-ing the intro to Fortunate Son

What do you mean? Summoning was added with the 2.0 TBC pre-patch and wasn't there before. I think only used the auto-grouping feature once because it was useless and nobody else used it. But it was there in vanilla. You could click a meeting stone or talk to an inn-keeper to group up with other people.

As someone who has spent 5k+ hours on bdo i laugh at that high droprate and only 15 hours needed.

Maybe try initiating more convo. Be the change!

Understandable, still, doesn’t remotely combat any point I was making, if that what you meant by your comment. Correct if I’m wrong but if you have 1 hour or 30 hours to play, you can still read the content and, with little to none effort, make sense of that content and figure it out? Or does it takes 30 minutes to read a paragraph? Well... it might take some people that long, so I apologise if you’re one of them.

Is it worth doing professions as you level? I feel like if you do that, you kind of just focus on leveling and ignore professions. I feel like maybe waiting till I'm 40 to get a mount then do professions might be the way to go, but I would like some input.
---
You have to use a remote access if you want to play at all, a couple friends use it and after i launched wow last night to find a 12k queue on shazzrah i think im going to be doing the same, either that or join a different server.
---
Similar thing happened to me in Deathknell. I just cleared a bunch of spiders around a chest, one more spider away and a rogue tries to sneak in and grab it, falls down a ledge and aggros 3 spiders all up. Worked out great for me because I got to loot the chest which had a whopping 13 copper, some cheese and water inside, score! The dickhead had the nerve to even message me with "really n***a?" Yes really, dude. 13 copper never felt so satisfying!

Are you?
---
Wow that's a great guide! Thanks, will try today tanking gnomeregan :D
---
Nice repost
---
I remember my very first wipe, with a gruesome corpse run from Razor Hill to Ragefire Chasm. By the time we made it back, the mobs had respawned.
---
wow...A group of friends
---
My ignore list is filled with people who end their sentence in twitch emotes.
---
Some of my friends play FF too, and it seems to be a quite good game... though I don't really like the graphic style.
---
Noted, and also to note I am leveling as combat right now. Level 15 and took parry first for riposte and then I will take the hit rating talents.
---
I feel so bad for people who dont PvP... Imagine your entire game is this and you never put your hard earned items to work fighting things that actually require you to use your brain.
---
How viable is Garrote in the scheme of things while leveling? Is it worth using while leveling into the combat tree? Or should I forgo stealth and just run in casually xD
---
I am using Google chrome remote on my mobile, so its easy to check the status of the queue, so I can start to line-up at the right time before going home, works great for me so far.
---
WoW Classic is, imo, the perfect balance. Other games before WoW had much harder struggles to earn loot, and they were tedious to the point of not being fun. Retail WoW made it even easier to the point it's mindless and boring. That sweet spot is hard to hit but classic has it.
---
There's one in tb aswell
---
Okay perfect, cause those are the ones I’m really looking forward to, and didn’t want to be holding groups back.
---
I think its fine as it is now - it is still WoW. Each tab is for a different game.
---
No
---
IT RERELEASE TIME
---
If you really want to buy a PC for just WoW, you need a somewhat good CPU, and a SSD to reduce loading times. 
---
Memory and Graphics can be mediocre, I mean, I can play WoW on low on my on-board graphics of my 5 year old notebook.
---
Speaking as someone who played perpetually broke tailor/enchanting mage through classic I heavily disagree. Enchanting only makes money if you have time to sit in capitals and spam trade chat.
---
I think I'll drop herb for BS, still on level 65 on lv14 Warrior.

Nerf warlocks!

&gt; Last Podcast on the Left

the who was phone meme was an old 4chan meme wasn't it, like old as fuck
---
I never used it in vanilla, but I was a noob back then so who knows :)
---
yeah and also you can't do the quests in a raid
---
Whats going on here
---
Yeah when I started out I think I clicked it once and nothing happened for like half an hour. Another time I tried it again and it did group me up with others after like 20 minutes, but we had no healer. That was the last time I used it because it was pretty useless and lfg channel was way quicker.

But That Lowers My DPS REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Unfortunately, while leveling, Life Tap restores between 1 and 2 shadowbolts worth of damage.
---
If you're REALLY concerned about life tap, use a wand. Then you almost never have to life tap.
---
Some dungeons are just straight up better for certain classes. I don't care if you need every piece of mail if I'm a clothy, because I know there are runs where I will be able to use everything that drops.
---
yea I made the mistake of grinding instead of just doing dungeons when I went out of quests to do at level 25\~  
---
I did some quests a bit too early... I'm back on track now though at level 31.
---
My bug is that I instantly DC somewhere between Ratchet and Booty Bay when I'm on the boat to BB. EVERY. TIME. I can relog before the boat makes it to the teleport spot, but it's weird.
---
Used to be 10 and now 3:
---
just today while playing I heard my GPU fan suddenly spinning crazy. I looked at my temp, GPU was close to 90c no wonder the fan noises. So I just randomly turned it down to 3 and, OMG I love the look of 3 settings MUCH MUCH better than 10. And I’m now on 3
---
Yeh I have to spend time with my girlfriend instead, it's fantastic..
---
Yeah that’s what I figured for the SM aoe, and I’ve seen it with ZF so that’s probably gonna be similar. I’m kinda hoping ST and Mara aren’t aoe fests though.
---
But you can still talk about classic in r/wow , and still trash BFA in r/wowclassic
---
Feign death trap doesn’t work ? Oh boy... pservers were better. Legions engine is garbage. Hunters will suck in PvP without feign trap. Oh and scatter shot sharing DR with ice trap sucks even more
---
The music makes it.

Pretty sure a subscription is mandatory

Why would you do anything but all max on a gaming pc? This is an old game, easy on hardware.

Oh no, now I can confirm that every single dumb thing I read in general is typed by a paladin
---
I've played a bunch on private servers so i feel like i know what i'm doing but obviously i die a decent amount either way. My SO however hasn't played WoW in like 6+ years, i was surprised at how much she had forgotten(like soulshards while maining a warlock) but she dies SO. FUCKING. MUCH and it is freaking hilarious to listen to. She forgot to train new abilities from 1 - 5 and got rekt by the named troll in the cave in the gnome/dwarf starting zone because all she had was rank 1 shadowbolt. God i hope she doesn't give up, having so much fun just watching her.
---
Video or it didnt happen
---
i love her so much
---
I genuinely laughed out loud at this.   
---
Well played!
---
eciN
---
Keep in mind the only thing you're missing out on is "bind on pickup" equipment. Otherwise you can use the gathering professions to pay others to do the legwork for you.
---
Shamans are pink you heretic
---
It's just inital success for now. To be a financial succes, classic needs to acquire a load of subs on long term.
---
Go retail you filthy casual! 😁
---
I played a hunter back in vanilla, but it's been a while.  In raids and some of the later dungeons (I remember undead strath in particular) you would often have a hunter manage the pulls.
---
Using a low rank arcane shot gave you just a little threat, easy for a tank to pull off from you, and then let you distract shot off one mob into an ice trap etc. 
---
It let you have the control in tricky pulls in particular as there was always an option of feign death. 
---
For lower level dungeons though it tended to be overkill.
---
There's 3 more to get tho
---
Need if you need. If you get 3 out of 3  good for you you just got a huge upgrade that run and questing should be a bit easier for a level or two
---
As a German, yes.
---
Maybe it's best to just vendor all gear unless you want to sell it on the auction house, the materials you get for higher level gear will be more worthwhile to disenchant as it's going to be the most used.
---
The content was great, but that microphone quality is just below all standards
---
I'm so confused, isn't skinning way faster? I'm only level 33 right now but I've had no issues with keeping up my skinning; in my group of 3 friends it's consistently been the highest gathering prof (the other two have mining and herb), both of them often have to skip nodes we run across since their skills are too low.
---
Maybe part of that was leveling 10-18 or so in darkshore where most mobs are skinnable, but even after that it's not been an issue at all
---
&gt; If i'm Life Tapping after a fight I follow it with food
---
Life Tap until HP and MP are even and then eat/drink.
---
I call it the double-drink!
---
However, even after explaining this to healers, they'll still hit me with a heal while I'm eating.
---
I hope you are a horde, because i can't imagine to fight by your side! 
---
It's not about honors. It's about faction pride!
---
It
---
I deeply hate you.
---
Thanks, you just reminded me of one of the things I loved about wow back in the day. The fight for the chest. somehow I enjoyed both being the one sniping it from someone as much as I love-hated being on the receiving end. It just made the world seem a bit more brutal, a fight for survival where you would fight even with your allies over what is essentially just scraps. I might resub for this reason alone.
---
They’re not bots, just second accounts with the Leatrix add on. Which is allowed.
---
I would not call that retail mentality. It's human mentality at that point.
---
This sounds like sharding. How is it different?
---
But why? I'm not interested in BfA talk at all. I'd rather have a subreddit exactly for the subject I'm interested in.
---
You know, the concept reddit was based on.
---
is GTX 1060 Max q enough to run on ultra with low fan noise?
---
People say that even just vendoring all your skinning leather you'll have enough for a mount at 40 which is a good enough reason for me
---
I've kept it all for now and am just storing it in case the price gets any higher soon though, or I might take leatherworking...
---
It's in the default UI. System settings -&gt; advanced -&gt; UI scale.
---
The first battlegrounds will open in a few months - I won't even go so far and say this year.
---
2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 arenas were never a thing in classic, they came with TBC.
---
I know it’s just a meme, but that name isn’t taken. It’s not allowed because it violates one of the rules on character names:
---
&gt; (x) Comprised of gibberish (e.g., "Asdfasdf", "Jjxccm", "Hvlldrm");

---
Awesome, thanks for these tips! Makes sense. I'll go research wands then.

---
Complete sentences? Proper grammar? I love you. More than a friend.
---
Private servers guessed at almost everything. It's funny that people think blizzard would use them as a guide.
---
Its 3 days to expire...
---
It would be great if they would implement arenas as a purely fun alternative to BG's, as most PVPers like Arena. I personally would love the change. However, the word "change" is controversial to say the least in Classic.
---
The deposit is based off how long you want to post it and a percentage of the vendor process of the item. So a lvl 37 green boot will have a higher deposit than a lvl 17 green boot because it would sell for more to an NPC vendor.
---
dungeons really give a lot of gold/silver. I realized that right from the first dungeon run into rfc. I made like 60 silver without the quests. On that level, 60 silver is pretty nice. WC was over 1g. I'm sure 40-50s dungeons give 10g or more per run.
---
Not sure if numbers are off here or on the private server, though.
---
Will Overwatch and Overwatch 2 be on the same tab? Have to see
---
Mind you that's just for trash. For bosses initiate in SB/defense.
---
For the Alliance!
---
Because horde.
---
Since you can Scare Beast those, I'd say yes. Haven't tested it out though.
---
Wow, that’s the most gold i’ve seen in classic
---
same thing goes for Ghost Wolf, with improved talents you must be willing to ride over 17 seconds for mount to be more effective :D
---
Since when?
---
You don't need a lot of CC for the early dungeons, so I'd suggest skipping sap unless you really think you'll need it. Controlled pulls will be enough to keep most groups alive.
---
There are some ways to get around the rogue's initial aggro when using untalented Sap if you need it though. You will only have initial aggro on the other mobs, not having built actual threat. A warrior can get them off you without even being in melee range by shooting the mobs just after you sap to get in combat and then using Heroic Shout on the group. If you sap and run the mobs around the corner to a waiting tank who uses Demoralising Shout/Roar, Consecration or any other AoE skill they'll also instantly peel off you. 
---
In a real pinch you can use Vanish to drop combat and remove yourself from the thrat table entirely.
---
Make sure the healer doesn't heal you until the tanks have the mobs though, otherwise they'll instantly run over and attack the healer instead.
---
I played it for a while too, while also playing WoW. It was hard trying to adjust to the 2.5 second GCD but after coming to terms with the fact that the longer GCD is because of the massive animations even some simple spells have, I kinda got used to it. It was a nice filler for when wow had content droughts. Played several jobs and I would have to say my favorite are summoner/White mage as they felt really similar to warlock/priest in wow.
---
Wait till i tell you about Druids travel  form. The horde skin is taken from nature and was evolved to be hard to see, and the alience is perfect for hiding in shadows. +you are imune to polymorf and can go cat/sprint every few minutes for extra boost.

---
Shift+left click on the minimap icon.
---
That depends kinda on how you want to level and what professions you want to take.
---
Gathering professions are quite nice to level up while leveling , there is a few hot spots generally that if not overrun let you complete a certain tier rather quickly and you can gather a lot of resources to sell this way. Easiest is probably Skinning since you will be killing beasts a lot and it’s just extra money.
---
Crafting professions are a different story. Enchanting and Tailoring are fairly easy to level alongside leveling. You can craft gear out of the cloth that drops and disenchanting crafted gear , quest rewards or drops to level enchanting. 
---
Crafting professions (leatherworking , blacksmith and tailoring) also have the advantage of making your own gear so you get earlier access to say helmets or shoulder pieces, and you can keep your gear somewhat up to date if you get no drops or quest rewards to replace items.
---
Engineering is a mixed bag, while some items  can be very good and powerful it’s the most expansive to level as it needs many different resources ( mostly ores and gems) which have you traveling to find the specific resources a lot of the time.
---
Basically if you plan on regularly visiting dungeons it may be easier to skip professions but if you mostly want to quest and grind then level gathering professions or combine it with the respective crafting profession to get an advantage by making your own gear or stockpile resources to sell or use later .
---
Mages and paladins are the most social players. First ones are always drinking and second ones are killing stuff with white swings.
---
Clara heeft dikke memmen
---
Real OG know all the locations.
---
Old problems requires old solutions.
---
We create problems where there are none. Because that's the way of the millenials.
---
All that stuff is why I like rogue. You have a ton of options for everything. You have to make a lot of decisions and react and plan on the fly constantly. My personal favorite is stealth-distract-ambush-gouge-backstab. If I'm fighting an elite, evasion. More gouge backstab. When it wears off, blind, bandage. Gouge backstab. If luck doesn't go my way, sprint. If they daze me, vanish.
---
It took effort and because people who work 9 - 5 at the time cried about having to try to get anything, they removed it.
---
And some people think rogue is the lazy dps class... lol
---
Gnomes are pretty much pvp bis for all the classes they can be, so if pvp is your thing, yes it’s worth rerolling. In pve the +5% int is mildly useful (something like 23 int more in full T3) but nothing life changing.
---
Yes, no shit. All they did was up it. Huge difference...
---
Definitely go swords, spam sinister strike and usually evis around 3rd or 4th point dependent on crit luck and mob hp at the time.
---
Things get alot easier when you get your poisons and add instant poison.
---
Make sure your main hander has a very slow attack speed so that sinister strike hits harder.
---
Whatever you like and what not - just do youself a favor and stop throwing around with insults. It doesn't really makes you seem like a decent adult. It's ok to not like a game, but there's no need for that.
---
I imagine this is for your class quest ? If you just want to level up fast it’s probably better to skip it, but if you want to enjoy then game and see the content while its challenging I say go for it. Just make sure your pick up all the flight paths on your way like in arathi , hillsbrad , hinterlands and western plague lands before you return.
---
It's always the "common" item that takes forever.
---
They're not going to do that because it could make retail look like it's doing poorly to investors.

Changed my rhythm to play in the morning before work. I have to leave at 8 am so i'll play from 5/5:30am till 7:45am. I excersize in the evenings and go to bed at 9:30 pm. In the weekends i'll just go all out.

I had a 'lock main back in the old days, and I'm pretty sure everyone knew back then that unlike a mage, my mana bar is green, 'locks don't get heals, getting killed is my problem (and for god's sake keep the soulstone up on the healer).
---
To add to this, from my current experience up until level 30: Servers are so absolutely packed with ppl, I was able to sell absolutely every last green BOE item on the auction house for at least double the vendor value. It is creepy how fast shit sells because of all the layers.
---
Put 10 trollsblood potions in last night an they were all sold by the time I managed to walk out the AH, all bought by different ppl.
---
I'm pretty sure that working for a year on polishing up an old project and netting millions in the first days counts as a financial success.
---
Really a 10/10 post
---
I was always wondering how they handle the monotony. Every boss is boring after at most 5 times doing it, even with more complex rotations
---
So I stuck with a quest (Infiltrating the Castle), and couldn't progress it, as this quest giver doesn't show the quest text, [only his normal dialog](https://i.imgur.com/PTNBamT.jpg). What the heck should I do? So far I disabled all addons, restarted the game, and abandoned the quest, none of them helped.
---
It’s the same thing in old school RuneScape. All people ever care about now is efficiency and money.
---
Exactly 👍
---
Apologies ahead of time for mic quality in the clip.. lower the volume!
---
U can go low as long as u are careful with aggro cuz u got too close
---
And bring lots of mana food. Even the lv5 one or harass a mage. And some minor potions for the last boss.
---
Well said. For some reason people want to vilify anyone who got XP this way even though most players had no reference for intended functionality since they didn't play vanilla. Maybe they're bummed they didn't benefit from the bug, or maybe they're just grouchy. Either way, they're the only ones still worrying about it.
---
I cheered on an orc hunter on his third and successful try to solo some higher level elite. Why wouldn't I?
---
Did he send them as individual mail? Because if they are sent together the cod price is for all items in a single mail
---
you've lost your marbles apparently.
---
Ahhh the glorious furbogs rod of transformation right?? I still have it on my retail warlock, really the only reason i havent transfered him from his server haha
---
Tank runs in and body pulls pack. Instantly taunts the first enemy even though no-one else has attacked it. Doesn't use any aoe threat mechanics and complains when the first heal pulls 3 mobs onto the healer.
---
Well that's a shame. Now you get your pet at level 1 and don't have anything to do with it compared to Vanilla..
---
Meanwhile I’m hyped af for running SFK when I get home
---
Nope and I’m still a higher level than all of my friends who did.

Self healing with raid specs is pretty limited. I'd say warlock can't meaningfully self heal in an endgame scenario with raid spec. Drain Tank spec is a totally different beast though.
---
what else am i suppose to do while questing/dungeoning in classic :) ?
---
- zoom in to first person so bobber is front and center
---
-set fishing to mouse button 3-4-or 5
---
-turn off all other music and sounds except the one that splashes 
---
-one handed fishing to watch ~~porn~~ Netflix
---
Totally agree, would love for arena in classic, even if it didnt have any rating or rewards.
---
Big GZ, Where are the binds though?
---
"You responded to my post as though I was talking to you directly and inferred that I assumed you were, "keeping up with the Joneses."'
---
Sure, because you replied directly to my comment.  No offense taken though and sorry for being a bit abrasive, just a lot of people have been telling people like me that we're wrong for playing the game in a way that's fun for us because it isn't fun for them.  I apologize for that.  Have a good evening and happy hunting!
---
All right, so at low levels warriors are lacking damage. His best opener if he's not line of sight pulling is battle stance charge, thunderclap, swap to defensive stance and bshout/demo shout, saving mocking blow/taunt for snap aggro. Things won't last long enough to stack sunders usually.
---
Deadmines/RFC it will be impossible to hold aggro, but things should die quickly enough that it won't matter. As he gets more gear, it'll become easier.
---
Ah, now I get it. Hadn't had my usual coffees today, so I'm a bit slow :)
---
Streamlining it is. This kind of stuff doesn't fit to the eSports/Speedrun - philosophy and direction Ion is leading the game atm. This is too much meta-gameplay, and keeps you from playing the daily chore simulator which is retail.

I don't know if you've heard, but there has been a lot of (NSFW) [scientific research](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/7kmsyi/erections_and_depths_of_world_of_warcraft/?limit=500) that has been done to study just that very subject. How tall various WoW races are and the "action" that they can provide.
---
Kirtonos is a non-issue, the item necessary to summon him is dropped by mobs/bosses in the instance.
---
The only summoned quest boss you might want to refight and can't because you turned in the quest is Avatar of Hakkar in ST I think.
---
"Your mothers will be reborn as rats"
---
That really made me chuckle. 
---
OP must be a warlock. "Curse of Rats: Can be cast on an enemy chest stealer to reduce their happiness by 90%. In addition, the victim's mother will be reborn a rat. Instant. 30 min cooldown."
---
Dude there aren't quests everywhere. He's new and its not obvious.
---
What lvl was he? What lvl were the mobs and what lvl were the DPSers?
---
Also were they letting him attack first and build aggro?
---
Warrior tanking in classic is a LOT more a team effort. The DPS cant attack immediately and expect the tank to grab and hold threat like in retail.
---
He needs to be allowed to attack first, ideally get in a thunderclap to help grab general threat and then sunder his primary target. Furthermore they need to attack HIS target.
---
It goes without saying he needs to be in def stance. But if his DPSers are a few levels above him and the mobs are also higher lvl than him he will struggle because of higher mise, dodge and parry chances of the mobs combined with high damage output to compete against.
---
There are mods that can make it easier to see magical buffs on targets. I don't play a shaman in Classic (did main one back in vanilla though) and haven't looked into mods much yet, so I don't know what's available for Classic.
---
You can also just look at spell effects, which can be more fun than having an addon tell you when to purge. Shields, HoTs and buffs will usually have fairly obvious spell effects if you pay attention to when the mobs cast and it's not as if shamans are terribly starved for global cooldowns, so purging a little too much isn't a big issue.
---
I didn't struggle to interpret it, my point was that it was nonsensical.
---
 I'm not the one struggling to figure out that what you said was dumb.
---
Nah wrong film, Hook's from Peter Pan.

This is why I walk to people. Guy told me to cod him plans for mithril spurs I told him no I'll meet him. Spent 30 minutes to ensure I got the sale and didn't put up with having it returned after depreciation.

Spittin' like machine gun fire.

gz from a fellow Shaman on Stalagg! I'm leveling much slower than you but still really enjoying the game so far.
---
It's my karma and I need it now!

I don't mind the occasional pop culture reference, especially if done subtly. But they went too far with it post Vanilla for my taste.
---
Level 12, level 47 fishing.
---
Get a grip. Who gives a shit?
---
What level is he?  
---
Does he have all the skills up to that level?  
---
Is he in defensive stance?  
---
Is he using a shield?

4am for you too?
---
Sharding is layering but at a zone/subzone level, layering is at a continent level
---
If you think you will keep regretting your choice, it would be better to do it now than later (don't delete your current Warlock though). 
---
Give it a try and see how you feel about it. If you're unhappy you can go back to your human lock knowing you've made the right choice.
---
Most mobs in the world and in dungeons while leveling, deals nature og fire damage, so I'd recommend those two while leveling, if you have the skillpoints for it.  
---
If you can only buy one, go for Nature.  
---
There is so much posion and lightningbreath/lightning bolt etc from mobs, so that's your best value

You F'd up lol.

Your kind of people are dust in the wind, a foul taste and empty to everyone you meet, and eventually you consume yourselves, leaving nothing remembered except scorn.

Theres more, you should go write conspiracy theories about Epstein on another subreddit and stop making shitty conspiracy theories about /r/wow, they take BFA criticism and dont delete it unless you try to start a war or toxicity.
---
The fact that it's so hard for you to understand such a simple concept is, quite frankly, embarrassing.
---
That's the thing - a team of people had to be paid in advance to make classic a thing. This was a big investment, and this only pays off if the game helps to keep up sub numbers in long term.
---
He is making a general argument, not specifically related to this post. 
---
He says that selling things now to have gold for your first Mount is better than waiting a couple of months and then selling it.
---
You called this guy "toxic trash" for suggesting that Classic should have its own tab. Just think about that for a minute.

I'd give my middle nut for WoW 2.

Is there a way to crop a part of an image like OP intended without opening up a program to do so?

Look for oRA3. As mentioned you do need multiple accounts and the ability to multi box to do this solo
---
Hey im kinda having the same issue as well. Im at the part where you are supposed to use the flare and lockpick the chest in northern barrens.
---
I read somewhere from a guide that if you drop the guest item after lockpicking it that you can lockpick the chest again therefore leveling your lockpicking up.
---
However after dropping the guest item my whole guest got abandoned and now i cant find the guest anywhere to start again.
---
Pls help.
---
Realm transfer? Please elaborate 🤗
---
Why are you singling yourself out? I've never experienced any anti LGBTQ rhetoric on WoW, and I'm straight - people are just more interested in playing the game.
---
I played a shaman only in the wotlk days, so it was always blue for me. Vanilla was so long ago I didn't remember it ever being pink.
---
I know right. 90% of people you will play with will be holding different opinions and cracking different jokes than you would, but what does that matter when you are slaying Murlocs..? Besides, you really got to find a bad apple to find a hateful guild.
---
Actually, he's being called toxic trash for insulting every person who disagreed with him in this thread, with accusations and personal attacks. But you go right ahead sticking up for him.
---
Someone posted this ingame couple days ago and I thought surely everyone is LGBT friendly? Then it occurred to me that probably wasn't the issue and that it was more the casual jokes people through around without thinking.
---
Nice fallacy. Retail is objectively a RPG. You lvl your toon, you find better gear, ect. Now it's a shitty RPG system but it's still a RPG.
---
Welcome to the Real Wow where you can't go full nuke 1s after the tank has gone in.. You need a threat meter, dps need to manage their threat, and learn how to slow down unless they want to become the tank... Until tanks are hit capped threat won't be great but its very unlikely they will be hit capped at low levels.. The answer is simple, forget everything you know about leigon and BfA.. That's not how it works here..

Working on it. Although I think it’s gonna get in the way of my getting a mount when I hit 40, I’m 35 now with like 25g. I do love that it just says feral Druid.
---
This has happened to me once a day on my shaman. Its getting ridiculous. Im literally just running around in ghost wolf, picking herbs, and someone will question my sexuality because I didnt notice them struggling.
---
Try not to suck for once in your life.
---
If I dont heal you or help you as im doing something, get over it. These people are so lacking in mental fortitude  that it makes me sick.
---
I think the extra crit chance from agi is more useful at lower levels where 1-2 crits can help you down a mob much faster vs the better base dps gain from str
---
I havent seen any gray drops other than whiskers, tails, fangs etc. Did they not drop gray equipment or was that just a pserver thing.
---
I do Q E 1234 then Shift + then Ctrl + (ctrl is for typically for my buffs)
---
I haven't really seen someone use a similar setup to me. I have 12345qertf and alt+qwertasdf bound to combat related abilities, with a few non-combat things like mount/rez bound to zxcv.
---
Not a big fan of shift or alt + 12345 etc. Feels like it takes you further from "home row" of wasd than any of the binds I listed above.
---
My pet not using growl can sometimes take aggro from a warrior at lvl 23. Pretty sad for them tbh.

he's taking the picture imo

24g at level 30 if that helps

Can I be your friend?

Thought I would be around level 40 by now. Just did my first Deadmines run and it felt like I'd finally made it to the real content.

People are fucking weird, but I feel you left something out in your post.

How do you dungeons.. you're with 6. Poor sixth wheel..
---
So no video? Just a half assed screen shot. Nice. 5v1 a poor shaman Tryna quest

If they leave me to kill the mob myself after that I just sheep it and let them have it at full health

I don't know but over at Pograine we've established RAM RANCH. You're welcome to join if you enjoy some good ol' RAMMIN' and cowboy banter.
---
We've even got a leatherman and some hung horses. gachiBASS guaranteed.
---
That's definitely feasible in situations where it can be expected that the additional healing is needed but you won't have to cast again within the next 5 seconds.
---
It's not so easy to determine where the cut off-point is between benefitting more from the additional regen-time and the worse HPM of the hot lie.

Worked 100%, got rogue, have a rogue :)

that's just add ons my dude

I love the people playing classic. We finally have communication and help again. Yesterday some shaman asked if a mage had water and buffs. I pmed him and walked to him. Buffed both guys and gave them 40 water each. They gave me 20 silver. Felt good
---
Meh, and still then, grow a bit of a skin... I see plenty of jokes at my own minor expense and giggle. I bet you'd have to go out of your way to find a real hateful guild.
---
No. This isn't retail. Tanks can't just spam AoE to keep threat while hitting the skull. They will be switching between mobs to build threat on all of them. Attacking the tanks target via assist is a terrible idea.
---
Yeah I love waiting and getting disconnected right before I get in, then waiting again, playing for an hour and getting disconnected into a queue, it's great.
---
It's faction based game of dominance which you opt in into. You're arguing that making a winning move is immoral.

Same addon

And as forsaken, you also need a /laugh macro.

For the ambience.

So did you get the fork of truth already?

Did you leave the house at all this week!? ;p
---
There's also this thing called "making problems out of nothing". If this is the kind of thing you have time to get upset about, you're probably too young to move out of your mom's house.

Well as a casual, if I only get to play 1-2 hrs before sleep I'm ok with it :p  If there was no queue I could play 5 hours a day...but do I really want do be doing that?
---
I've stumbled across him a couple of times on Twitch when I was bored and this guy is just a regular douche. I watched for maybe 30 minutes combined and the way he was acting like he's god or something really pulled me away.
---
I started started playing wow for the first time when vanilla was released last week. I really wish I'd had played before to experience the nostalgia all you are having!
---
Someone on the official forum said 2.1.3, so yes. Cant vouch for the accuracy but I trust it.
---
Frost is by far the best. The utility and mana cost of frost spells provide control with good damage output.
---
Are you jumping when you eviscerate? You do more damage if you jump while using eviscerate.
---
At least you don't have to stare to that idiotic name for the rest of classic wow.
---
Same. And I find it unlikely people would know anything about my sexuality, race or any other such things. Im here to play a game and have a good time. Real life rarely comes up except for small things.

What getting to 60 in ‘a good amount of time’? Also, who sets that bar? I know your point, I know what you are going to say, still, my point being: You all robe yourselves from an experience, not only that but, misuse and misjudge what World Of Warcraft was meant to be back when it released. 
---
Regardless, because anyone is free to experience the game In whatever fashion one desires.
---
The reason why I lead with why was precisely due to what it meant, Ii wanted to understand, understand and thus far all everyone but yourself could muster was: I don’t have time for it, I have better things to do, while all I wanted to understand was why, Why would you choose to have a dog if you won’t be able to cope with the training? The dog would still be what it was intended to be, you on the other hand is the one expecting your dog to teach himself where to pee. Take the time to train your dog where to, take a 2 minutes break to read the damn text, your might actually experience what the game was intended to be.

I queue up as i come home, get stuff done and usually it's over by the time i'm available to play. Not always though, but a 1.5 hour queue becomes 20 minutes, which is fine.

The result of being an elite mob wandering around an area where he is about 10-15 levels higher than the players on average.

Now that undead 35 elite around the cripts in the north west that guy is like the Liam Neeson of undeads.
---
Frost is best for leveling due to abilities to freeze/slow mobs. Fire is doable too if you want to do it for your RP/immersion but you will still need to use Frost spells. Arcane is awful.
---
Not really the same, but I had the Echeyakee quest where you summon a creature with a special item in order to kill it, then the item disappears from your inventory. 
---
I summoned Echeyakee but was attacked by a random mob, and while I was fighting it off, a Hunter came along and tamed the creature I needed to kill...
---
I had to abandon the quest and go all the way back to Crossroads to re-do it... I was livid.

Do you still have the flare to summon the dwarf? Try using that again at the base of the tower.

No one gives a shit if you like dick in your ass. Just heal dude.
---
I’m just going to warn the parent commenter - the notion that skilling tailoring or, especially, enchanting, while leveling is “easy” is downright humorous.  It’s true that at a low level you’ll be able to keep up, but sometime between level 30-45 you’ll fall behind and have to put them on hold until you hit 60.  Enchanting is a notorious money sink, and tailoring can eat up pretty ludicrous amounts of cloth (30+ stacks of silk, for example) that are simply unsustainable without significant money or time investment, both of which are far more efficient to just put off until 60.  Not to mention that first aid alone could eat up most of your cloth, depending on your class.
---
In theory I like it for this reason, but in practice I just keep sitting at my chair, reading reddit and chatting on discord , and then I play so I get even LESS work done

Believe it or not some people enjoy things that other people don't.

If you wanna lifetap a few times, no big deal, but if you think you can spam it and I'm gonna constantly top you off because you can't manage your damn mana, then you better hope you don't take any fucking hits.

I use Zperl for unit frames and Titan Panel for the bar across the top. To get Zperl to work though you need to use the quickfix [here](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24963-Z-PerlUnitFramesquickfix.html). Its fairly simple and something I've been using... for well as long as I can remember. On retail I use Bartender too but for more of a classic look I don't use that right now.
---
Level 30 is the best. So may zones open up to you. 30-40 is my favortite
---
Didn't think that came of as overly aggressive. Its a genuine question even though some of you might feel as if I'm attacking your sense of worth.
---
I'm asking why this is the hill people wanna fight on, I literally cannot understand why the rotation of abilities has to be where a MMORPG derives its complexity and competition from.
---
This is a lot to unpack but thank you! may check it out !!!!
---
The grey whiskers, long tails are what I was farming, no grey gear. Why would a jaguar have chest piece? :P armoured cat inbound?
---
In vanilla warrior tanks just spam sunder armour and shouts for multi aggro.
---
That just made me hard.
---
I had a similar experience so far because of the outrageous queue times which caused some of my friends to play on another realm. Leading me to make  an alt which is level 30. While my main sits at level 32. 
---
Having characters on separate realms allows me to have a character to play if I end up in a 45+ minute queue on my main’s server. 
---
 A side note that I understand could be less than relevant to other players, it reinvigorated me by breaking the monotony of grinding the same class through levels and also keeps me within similar level range of both groups of friends due to their drastically different lifestyles and play times.
---
Very good idea :)
---
I feel you man I cant bring myself to login into warframe for a reputation turn in , thats like 2 mins of work
---
Fire is better unless you want to aoe, but by this point aoe spots are crowded, go fire, it's a blast to level as.
---
Yeah I think that's the best strategy
---
I just finished wetlands and OH BOY. So much free real estate. I was in the excavation site and just followed some warlocks and let them tag a mob, then helped kill it, and they looted it and I skinned. None of us said a word.
---
I leveled my skinning by like... 30 points. Could barely get anything done there. On a quest, going to an objective, but oh look.. a crocolisk. I should kill the crocolisk. Oh look, another crocolisk. And another.
---
Looking forward to stranglethorn vale.
---
See my comment below for clarity on the definition of glitch and my argument.
---
&gt;Am I doing something wrong?
---
Yeah definitely. 
---
The damage from the frost spec come from 2 talents, Shatter and Ice shards. 
---
Until you have 10 points in both those talents, you shouldn't spam frostbolt. Cast one first to slow down the mob and then cast one or two fire ball, frost nova, get some distance, frostbolt, and baguette to finish it off.
---
I'm always stacked in Bandages and Health Potions and give a headsup to the Healer that I usually don't require more than a Renew at best so the runs go quicker usually.
---
People in the comments being very naive here
---
EU, Hydraxian Waterlords, Alliance.
---
Casual player, coming back for the nostalgia, just looking to experience the world and the dungeons again. Have a warrior I'll be using to tank, and a warlock for fun. Would be good to join a friendly guild.
---
Thanks it worked.
---
Classic/vanilla's design philosophy was all about the journey, not the destination. Devs have mentioned this numerous times when talking about it, how they wanted players to remember the friends they grouped with. Retail has gone more to the way of skip the journey and just get to the destination.
---
My rule of thumb for healing non-aggroed-dps is "if my mana% is higher than their health% and I would cast a heal anyways or am full"
---
I've not really seen anyone complain and request me to heal them when not necessary. Most people only complain about a lack of healing when they die.
---
Definitely. You have the ores already so it will be very quick to get 70 blacksmithing. Check AH prices for gear you are crafting. You might make a bit of money back
---
&gt;tupid little mobs will "dynamically spawn" faster than we can kill them
---
Where did you encounter this? I'm pretty much standing still AFK waiting for mobs all day.
---
There also needed for a turtle meat quest and are spaced out so are quite inefficient
---
I would also like to know this. Currently leveling as enhancement.
---
I know I'm definitely in the minority, but I actually prefer to not have classes show up. Unfortunately, I tried out ElvUI briefly and it made this change. 
---
I can't figure out how to revert it. Do you know if there's a similar command that resets everyone to the same color?
---
lol he cast shadow ward half a second before the random shadowbolt landed
---
What's mara?

Sheeping a night elf just as the action bar is about to fill and taking the chest while he wanders aimlessly is peak fun

On every server are assholes and good people. People with all kind of different opinions, this always leads to conflict. You simply can't make an environment where nobody ever says anything insulting to anybody, but you _can_ avoid those people. There is no server which is more or less friendly to the LGBT community, so this whole question is a bit ridiculous.

---
Holy shit man. You're really not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?
---
Farming mobs in retail is horrible what? Mob grinding is totally vanilla.
---
On my 36 rogue, I find that dagger spec takes slightly longer to kill a mob, but you end up controlling the fight a lot more.
---
I have a rotation where mobs are dead by the first eviscerate:
---
Ambush, wait for 100 energy, gouge, wait, backstab, SS, SS, Eviscerate.
---
If by the first backstab they aren't at 50% I change it to:
---
Ambush, wait, gouge, wait, backstab, wait, gouge, backstab, Eviscerate.  Then repeat gouge and backstab until they are dead.
---
You take a lot less damage than sword spec, and you're ready for wpvp...  So fights take longer but you have less down time.
---
You can also speed fights up with blind, but blind is worth 10 silver on my server ...
---
Is there an add on that shows mining spots on map?
---
Gatherer is broken rn
---
I used to do it fairly regularly until the D1.5 quest chain came out and the timed run had to be done 5 man. Didn't they put a hard cap on all dungeons except BRS at some point too?
---
I understand the frustration, I'm a feral spec'd druid (for the purpose of leveling) but only ever heal in dungeons. When they life tap they are trading off a huge amount of health for an equal amount of mana. Try thinking in terms of what the mana can do for the actual fight and how little mana it will cost you to help him slightly. Sure. If the tank is gonna die then keep on him, the lock will be fine for a second, but once you get your tank healthy just pop a low cost heal on him, my got to is usually to give them a rejuvenation because its fast and good enough for the time being. 
---
In other words, what is more impactful to you? Letting the warlock die and you end up wiping because you dont have enough DPS to finish the fight before you are OOM, or losing 100 mana. You rolled healer, it's your job to keep them alive and losing 1 person can wipe you all.  Theres a lot shitter things to deal with as a healer so just learn to live with it or dont dungeon with a warlock. 
---
As far as them not bringing water, that's their own damn fault. You gotta have something to regain mana if you are class that uses it.
---
Suck it up. Sometimes you win big sometimes you get nothing.
---
Lol yeah makes no fucking sense.
---
i ran 21 times. id def get pissed if a shaman rolled because a shaman can melee cleave regardless of the weapon, u just need windfury to boost everyone. a warrior needs ravager to do melee cleave more efficiently and groups might not bring him if he doesn't have, while you will always be fine. also, ravager drop rate is very very small, like I've said, i ran 21 times to get mine.
---
luckily all my groups have been really friendly and supportive on my quest to get the Ravager and all shamans asked before hand if anyone cared if they rolled on something
---
Feeding the pet is a single click on a macro, I don't see anything behind it
---
Getting abilities for your first pet by taming other pets is a thing a lot of hunters didn't know before hitting lvl 60 and the levels you need to find a new pet for the next rank sucks hard, too
---
The pet trainer is just another npc you have to go to while leveling up
---
I don't see really good stuff behind that, because once you hit max lvl it's braindead and it just confuses newer players.
---
Glad to feel the anger behind it again, &lt;3 classic :)

What's there to get about searching for a guild that's more likely to not have homophobic members or casual slurring in the chat
---
&gt; mages can just spam you with frostbolts while running around a tree
---
Im confused 
---
1. how can they run while casting 
---
2. it wouldn't matter if they run arround a tree or just run straight away from you while spamming frostbolts the distance is the same a tree doesn't change anything except you not beeing able to target him when the tree is very very big.
---
Also i found it quiet funny what people get mad about i like it the way it is.

Oh yeah. Old, for sure. Can't even collapse comment strings in new. Why would they remove functionality?

Hahaha, I was trying to figure out who this mysterious rogue guest was!

Accept that pets won't hold aggro, at least at low levela. Spec affliction/demonology
---
I need strange dust tho
---
Honestly these sorts of oddities are one reason why veteran players often use quest/leveling guides.  I’m not at all suggesting you should for your first playthrough, but rather just saying that your experience is normal and hard to avoid.
---
If you’re okay with using WoWhead, you can sort the quests in a zone by their level requirement/suggested level are to get a better idea of when you want to go to a particular zone.  I’m not sure there’s a way to avoid this issue by just using in-game information.
---
Absolutely nothing wrong in asking, for me in fact I encourage asking.
---
But this guy rolled need on every item that was up for roll, and in my case he rolled need on a leather item when a Druid and Hunter rolled need as well and won, while being a priest...
---
And when we called him out on that he wouldn’t even answer in chat at all, and would proceed to pull mobs while everyone is trying to communicate with him.
---
Oh snap, you sure show them who's boss.
---
Except you don't because any decent lock knows they need to be careful and will tap down as far as they safely can, which may be in one-shot range. They aren't expecting anything from you.
---
And tapping is managing mana, it's the reason they have the ability, durrrrr.

I think that most gamers in the average age group of classic would assume that their guild is LGBT friendly without even having given it any thought. 
---
I had the same discussion with a friend of mine that's been running into a lot of uncomfortable situations in online games due to gay jokes and what not, which I don't think people consider LGBT "un-friendly", people just consider them silly jokes. 
---
I think there's a lack of knowledge of what the LGBT community considers LGBT-friendly - what does it take for a guild / server to be LGBT-friendly, and are those points fair to "demand" (wishing for no offensive jokes in Barrens chat would probably be a stretch)?. Is it having a no jokes policy in the guild? Simply stating that the guild is LGBT friendly? Having X percent LGBT members ? 
---
As I mentioned, I think a lot of us consider usselves inclusive and open to play with any type of gamer, but just don't consider it something specific to define our way of playing - or enough to be "anti-exclusive"
---
thats why a wand is a MUST have for cloth classes. makes lvling a lot easier and mana friendlier
---
Boomers
---
There is an ignore function, and you can always chose to not take part in any chats where someone can insult you.
---
I feel like there are bigger problems in the world. Like, surely you haven't reached the point in your life where you're this bothered over where a game is.
---
G E K O L O N I S E E R D
---
it's not about people caring that OP is LGBT. it's about OP wanting somewhere where casual slurs are not the norm
---
Could try something more simple for the targeting, though I use it for cc mostly,..
---
[target=mouseover,exists][target=target]
---
Just make 1 for each rank you want and set the key bind to X-key and Shift+XKey
---
More bag space is more vendor fodder space
---
The original world record was achieved with questing lol, you're lost bro.
---
damn i wish i had friends
---
imagine thinking that's the same as finding an LGBT friendly guild
---
That's great advice.  I wonder if it's best to buy the 100g mount or buy items I know will be increasing.  I guess I'll go for the mount as it will mean faster levelling.  Can you pm me advice on things I could buy?  I'm on Gnomergan server so if you're not on there we wont be competing :)
---
I'm leveling as Disc/Holy (going roughly 26/25), disc to spirit buff first, after initial 2 points in holy to avoid knockbacks on casting. Back to holy for improved renew (against conventional wisdom) as I overuse that spell.
---
I'm very dependent on my friends and dungeon grinding to level as fast as possible. It's certainly doable and you're virtually unkillable by mobs, but killing anything takes ages, as your only sources of damage are SW:P and your wand. Just so you know what you're getting yourself into.
---
Only one per server gets Scarab Lord title and other stuff that comes with it.
---
I still have 5 months subscription left and I just don't know if I ever get back to it... Compared to classic everything about it is too easy.
---
holy shit that was clutch
---
&gt;drop a HoT before you pull
---
As a tank, please don’t.
---
Any addons for xp per hour that shows it on screen?
---
Seems like a good post for r/wow
---
I think kids today think "mobile is good" because they're used to it, but those with PC knowledge understand mobile is mostly just bad code, poor-design, and an excuse to keep you locked into their data-farm.
---
i guess you missunderstand, wands should not gain damage from spellpower
---
You will be fine
---
Brilliant!
---
same
---
I am an elemental shaman so no, i dont have to manage threat
---
Wow, you have a toon called Karazak? Noice
---
It has been my warhammer role playing character for more than 20 years!
---
I, as a warlock, throw it about shamelessly. We also have soul stones and Hearthstone’s, as well as portals. We are useful! *breaks down* what do you mean you want another dps for deadmines but warlock doesn’t count...? *sobs* I matter.
---
Yea I realised that too and crossposted it
---
it took me 200 kills to get that fucking spider to drop that shit
---
it's not about it becoming a thing that's talked about constantly. it's just about finding a place where people are a little more empathetic about the language they use. this isn't complicated and the fact OP has seen so much pushback here pretty much proves their point
---
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDS!
---
Got a belt yesterday from a nice person with +6 fire dmg does that go 1:1 on all my fire dmg spells ? 
---
Meaning i do 66 instead of 60 dmg when i equip it. Still need 1 level to equip it so couldn't test myself.
---
BNP card reader + Colruyt, hi from Brussels :&gt;
---
I took my week off for next week, Classic wasn’t planned for me at all but now I really want to play a lot
---
no
---
Haha, never noticed we don't have any. Will do!
---
Peeman... interesting...
---
ok thanks i will do that then
---
You are right. Still, the redrawing of the trees in WotLK was a good thing.
---
I've had a few accounts that this happened to, so yeah I'd guess so. It's annoying that it's still a thing.
---
Yeah ok Mr nitpick.
---
As a Paladin it is my duty to support members of the Alliance. I resurrect anyone I see get killed by a mob. I do not attack horde, but I will engage if I see a fight. I heal and buff others when possible, especially warriors and rogues. 
---
Feelsgoodman.
---
Get fucked
---
To add to this, you can make a cancel aura for pws on a few key skills u start with. Weakened soul will block.long enough for rage
---
Enjoyment that my faction gain and advantage with every kill and minute wasted for the opponent. It's a competition.
---
I played retail for less than a month two years ago. I face rolled my way through the content. I needed help once, but there was nobody around with the same quest. I never saw anyone that needed help. The people I did come across weren't actually part of my server. They were just there temporarily and I'd probably never see them again. Nothing in that game encouraged social interaction in the same way that vanilla wow did.
---
I see where you're coming from. But trying to bring this kind of attitude into BFA is like trying to do yoga on the subway.
---
Im lv 30, i think im at a decent pace and ive been keepin up with skinnin/lw
---
I miss college as well :-(
---
The older I get, the more nostalgia builds and the more I want to play.
---
Updoot. But. For the love of all that's good, level out those target/player plates, boy.
---
Huntresses scared crap out me after doing this lol
---
Can confirm ElvUI
---
Print scrREEEEn
---
With the exception of character models I think.
---
Thank you and have fun as long as possible in classic!
---
Go to loot a chest today and just as I click it two mobs spawn. As I am fighting them a rogue runs up to try and steal the chest, one of the mobs I didn't hit so when he starts to open the mon turns and hits him. We kill the mons and turn to do the click roulette. A gnome had snuck up and got the chest right before the both of us. Rogue gets mad at me for som reason and follows me spamming //spit. His name had abbreviated derogatory terms in it so I just reported him for name violation.
---
Dude maxing out fishing and winning the fiahing tourney a handful of times was fantastic. Ok not leveling up the fishing but the fishing tourney was fun and the competition was intense.
---
I find skinning the least tedious because i never go out of my way, im killin this mob anyway, might as well loot it twice
---
Not sure about your question, but it's indeed the addon GW2 UI
---
Thank god for the filter, so stupid to have to break immersion with those kinds of names.
---
No, they use the %t variable to shout at their current target. The hunter's pet is named "UwU", so this is the result.
---
I hear you man, I'm looking for a vaccines cause autism server and a trump friendly server also for my mum.
---
I used to do this in quake 3 to improve my aim
---
The poor fucker who couldn't reach the knife, 35 years later: "Hey grandpa that looks like you from before you got old and grouchy!"
---
Interesting your take an what I meant.
---
I have never commented on my sexuality in wow with pugs.  I have had more homophobic slurs in wow than in irl by far and I'm well on the masculine end of things so they are rarely directed at me.  They are present regardless of my actions and are not a result of them.
---
What op wants, I think, is somewhere he can play without having to constantly hear people slating and making fun of his sexuality.   It has nothing to do with wanting to talk about LGBTQ stuff all the time but rather to be able to join a pug without being singled out and belittled due to your voice/sexuality.  This happens a lot in wow in my experience, though it has improved since vanilla.  
---
We don't need rainbows and unicorn flags, we do need to not hear low effort homophobic insults constantly or feel scared to join a pug in case they realise your gay and target you.   And wether we want to admit this it does happen still in the wow community.
---
Nice good! You look like a real thug!
---
sexuality is a spectrum thats cool, really it was just a friendly question, just wondering really -- but I apparently am asking the most fucked up question of the day for some reason.
---
Some objects LoS, others don't.  It's not really a bug, just the way the game was coded.  If you want that changed, you should probably stick to Retail.
---
Someone already got the Thunderdury link on Zandalari Tribe. Its hell
---
Tbh the gfx hold up pretty well imo
---
Did you figure out how to solve this issue?
---
Well in my opinion, its adds up to the rpg aspect of the game. Yes feeding your pet may sound pointless but if you don't he won't be happy and will do less damage, makes sense.
---
I just feel like it makes you more attached to your pet.
---
Love classic too ;)
---
"More explosions! I gotta have more explosions!"
---
Will be fun watching the new folks figure out pushing the buttons is mandatory now.
---
Casul
---
There's a layer on Arugal that has no NPCs in UC. Perhaps its a bug.
---
Titan panel
---
Nyooom
---
You can switch weapons mid combat. and it is probably easiest to make a macro to change weapon and stance in the same go.
---
I said before but deadmines is great for it. Obviously harder to get to as horde but still possible.
---
Retail is not a single player, detached game because of PLAYERS; it's because it got all its identity and character stripped off of it.
---
In Classic people group because there is reason to, people chat because there's reason to, and a lot of "downtime" running, standing around, so it's only natural to socialize. The game gives you chances to socialize at every turn. Looking for dungeon takes a while, running to it, wiping... It all forces interaction.
---
In retail there's no reason to ever group with anyone or ever talk to anyone. And as Classic has shown, it's the issue of the game itself and its systems, and not the playerbase.
---
It's a minor inconvenience at best, snowflake
---
IIRC when I was leveling up vanilla in 2005, I was playing some kind of elemental build. 
---
It's nice to pick up pyroblast for example, it's a good opener on mobs.
---
I’d take the 17 purple bars in the reality row any day.
---
I've gotten around this feeling by not playing in English. I make 5-10 flashcards a day and boom my WoW time is productive and leading me towards something I can put on my resume.
---
Your entire argument is pedantic and completely ignores that the word glutch has been common parlance in video game culture for literally decades.
---
Thanks for your response and yes you are right: you won‘t see the most guys again but you can have and create experience for both of you anyway! 
---
Have a nice day
---
im never emotionally prepared for those moments
---
As someone who quit in cata, and TRIED every expansion afterwards and only truly went the mile in legion. I tried being that change, that's how I noticed all the points that everyone else makes lmao, no one responds it's a simple hi, thanks, bye, 
---
You go try organising a wpvp raid, no one wants to do it! Cos no one communicates!!
---
quests in retail are just less challenging, that's all. and you do them so fast that it becomes unrewarding.
---
to each their own
---
Movement speed for all pets got normalized in patch 1.9  
---
But normalized attack speed is in TBC, so Brokentooth will be 1.0 attackspeed for Classic
---
I'm sub lvl 30.  U decide xD
---
You are right, this isn't complicated. I have played this game for 15 years now and I have seen somebody in any of the guilds I was in being targeted for being gay or trans. And I played with many LGBT people. 
---
OP wants a guild where OP can _explicitly_ talk about LGBT related stuff, what I read from the edit. This is not being about _LGBT friendly_ (which I personally define as guild which doesn't care about stuff like that and doesn't throw insults around like a 12 year old playing LOL), it's about literally looking for an LGBT guild.
---
And I already said that the best way to look for a guild like that is in an LGBT gaming community (imo). This is too specific for a subreddit like that.
---
Strange, I checked that tab multiple times and enabled every single checkbox. Will check again once I get home.
---
I've had very polite group members always ask, "cool if I need?" And I'm always reminding them, "if you don't and I win greed, it's immediate DE"
---
Is there a difference in the amount of rested XP i get depending on where my character is when I log out?
---
I have 2pc atm, i5 9600k with gtx1080, 16gb ram and i3 7100 with gt1030(gddr5, gt1030 have two modifications with gddr4 and gddr5, gddr4 is total shit) and 8gb ram, both with ssd and win 10. 
---
Low one can run classic smooth with hi settings(except  anti aliasing) 60fps full hd resolution. 
---
 i don't have 144hz monitor so i dunno how it can handle it.
---
But funny thing in dun morogh, near gnomeregan area, green smoke can drop my fps down to 25 on my gtx1080.
---
Act like the character instead of acting like yourself.
---
Retail has plenty of immersion. There, see, my argument is just as fantastic and well thought-out as yours. Now, let the downvotes rain, I didn't unconditionally praise Classic! Satan over here!
---
You can't swap *equipment* but you can swap weapons. Hunters do it all the time when something gets inside their range. And yes, I use a macro. It really isn't that much work. I have my bars set so that battle stance displays one set of bars, while defense stance displays a second set. Both sets are very similar to one another save for the specific skills between the two stances.
---
Im at 50g on 36, im afraid if i keep just questing normally i wont have 90g when i hit 40. Im thinking about grinding mobs for 1 or 2 levels.
---
I agree. I'm playing solo as well. But I'm having fun. Taking it slow. Not rushing anything.
---
I use steam inhouse streaming to stream wow to my big tv downstairs and 8 configureer my steam controller to play with classic wow. took some work but it works really well, better than expected.
---
Now I play wow from my comfy sofa with a controller
---
I'm past 55 and DM isn't out yet.
---
Not the most fucked up question,  but to most it is a major annoyance.  Even to me. Most people dont care what you are anymore. It's so hard slammed down people's throats these days that it gets old
---
Had one despawn on its own after I won a roll on it :(
---
level 16 in STV?
---
What's special about not wanting to hear offensive stuff
---
I never played pali before so i got to 30 and didnt realise this quest. Going back tonight to do it.
---
Starcraft 1 and Starcraft 2 are in separate tabs. Your argument holds no ground.
---
Yeah deviate fish was always good for making gold and fun to keep when the AH was too intense. AH mods save a lot of time for sure.
---
The problem is how far the game has went and how big and empty the entire game is, everything except the new areas is dead it's a big empty dead game with dead people and it's a real shame that they Fucked the job up
---
At some point surely you realise there's so much more to the game than one faction fame play. My mates and I were all horde back in 2004 .. all rolling alliance now to see the difference. Not everyone is a dick and hey if you don't like pvp, there are plenty of other servers. 
---
.... or go back to retail and gouge your eyes out at the lack of skill required for any content lol...
---
That moment when you realize that getting expert cooking is from a book in Ashenvale that costs 1g...
---
You’re a true hero
---
This was an epic movie scene
---
But that's not Classic, so it automatically doesn't count.
---
I hope you find a place that feels safe :) I imagine that it must be tiring with all the jokes, and I do think it's much to easy for a white straight guy like me to say "it's just a joke", because I don't think nearly as many jokes are made in our expense compared to most other groups. 
---
I do believe that it would be super healthy with some knowledge sharing toward all of us well-meaning people, that definitely do not intend not to be inclusive enough, on how to create more open communities - chances are it would make for a better experience for all of us.
---
I can agree with you on those points.
---
However, it is easier to jump on, do some LFG/LFR, some WQ and log back out without a lot of hassle. The problem is how mind numbing it all is.
---
Classic isn't necessarily 'hardcore' but it does require you to pay more attention during normal gameplay. On retail, I almost never need to drink or eat, need to think about how many mobs I've pulled, or even read quest info.
---
Of course, I should make it known that I'm not in a raiding guild and I haven't had to meet certain quotas for a guild since WotLK.
---
Thank's. 
---
To be more precise, the fun is long gone for me in retail. The last bit of fun were in cata and that was already a stretch so I'm not getting back to that game.
---
I agree, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. It did piss me off once when the other caster in the group got the necklace of the last strat live boss, then went to do cannon master and he also got the BiS necklace that dropped then while I was still in a green. Burned me up for a while but it's how it goes, I got the azuresong mageblade ahead of a lot of people who raided more than me in a pug
---
Yea it was often a mix. IIRC WC3 stored downloaded maps and screenshots in the game folder, but saves went into documents (a folder named Saved Games that no other game used).
---
The event is server-wide, the reward is the opening of the gates. There is nothing you can really lose out on besides the mount but I mean, that’s a very special case :p
---
But they wouldn't get it ''NOW!!!!'' :)
---
We were usually stacked on sweets (no I'm not overweight) so it was really just the 5 seconds of extra work to get rid of the box
---
Lol fair point
---
!remindme 8h
---
WC is the worst instance man.
---
Im lv 30 and ive loved them all again but WC.
---
RFC BFD SFK (The GoAT) RFK
---
They allllll good but WC, like unless you skinning, it sucks
---
OP just wants a place where casual slurring or homophobic/transphobic 'jokes' aren't made, what's so hard to understand about that that you need to type a message that long
---
Because there aren't many guild that will have this. Also it's good to not only live inside your own bubble community. Not everyone out there is homophobic.
---
Something similar happened to me. Pulled a little too much, and a horde warrior charged in and help me kill them.
---

---
100% True!
---
Damn son.
---
Hahaha the bot response 😂😂
---
Yeah I agree.  I may understand their need of wanting people to get to max level faster, because of new expansions and so on.
---
But their biggest mistake imo is the group finder. It literally killed any in game socialization.
---
I remember at Lich King when I started Wow, group finder was not a thing yet and when you were 80, in order to do your hero day quest, you add to find people to do your daily dungeon, and go with them to it as you couldn't teleport. The good days...
---
Requiring the least amount of skill? Have you tried tanking with BFA noobs who keep pulling threat in classic? It's like a job
---
He is talking about 1st on his server.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
StarCraft 2 isn't just StarCraft 1 with some expansion packs. It's it's own game.
---
BFA is just Classic WoW's 7th expansion
---
Not bad
---
Do you have skinning? If so then staying at Stranglethorn just grinding away should be a legit source of loads of income
---
exactly. They always so "classic rotation" but thats what they choose playing pve in a way. Yea its simple and dull but its mechanics are old also. Playing pvp makes up for everything i feel like.
---
You don't even know which server he plays on, how could you know if he lost 1st place ?
---
When you are gay you become a target for some people by default.  Same as being black, Asian, white w/e.  
---
I have experienced far more homophobia in wow than irl hands down, and mostly without cause.  Just because it's 'funny' to the other party.  It happens sadly
---
you have to imagine what would happen when you got 500 fire damage and a scorch was doing 500 more dmg every 1.5 seconds whereas fireball would be doing 500 more dmg every 3 seconds, eventually instant cast spells would get out of control.
---
every spell has a % of your total spell power that it benefits from, fireball is 100% of your fire spellpower on every single cast.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/)
---
I'm just here to read the pointless arguments, but man what a gatekeeping post to begin with.
---
By the way, in your install directory you have icons for both retail and classic that still take you to the launcher, but with the selected version ready in the drop menu. This is enough distinction in my opinion.
---
To be honest, I was thinking about this the other day and I’ve noticed some specs can probably do more if mana permits. Like for a short fight where a shadow priest for example can cast mind blast on CD after every 2 mins flays their dps would not be half bad. Not sure if this was a leveling thing but I remember in dungeons since most fights are short I could out dps mages/rogues since I am mins blasting on CD.
---
Could this possibly mean that when people out gear content, when fights are shorter and since classic wow is different than private server scaling (private servers tend to scale things to be harder/have more HP so you could have longer and harder fights etc)  we could possibly see specs like SP actually perform well? 
---
I’d be interested to actually play SP if I’m not brought in just to buff locks.
---
I am not sure what the limitations are for most other meme specs but for the ones limited by mana like SP and I believe moonkine? 
---
What do y’all think?
---
I would be happy to see “meme specs” become a thing as it only means more to enjoy for everyone!
---
I feel loyal to the Alliance more than my RL country
---
Ironically, the more he replies in his karma farming thread, the more karma he loses.
---
He DID put a disclaimer that he's definitely NOT whoring karma. It has to be true because it's the biggest part of his post. /s
---
Captain zimfox has a message you: L8r nerds!
---
Ok, so what you gonna do now?
---
gratz, what addon is that top bar?
---
But how faster would you level when you have excess cash at low levels to buy all your skills???
---
Laughs in Aquatic form
---
If after 15 years you still need to, then there is no point to do it.
---
I can make it sadder. I got engaged recently and I was thinking about non-family that I would invite to the wedding... There are 2 people, and one of them wouldn't be able to make it cuz he lives across the country
---
Sorry to hear they're being that way. I would recommend trying your trade or LFG chats to find a leveling buddy and maybe some new friends if they're being like that.
---
Agreed. But I feel TBC servers will end up being more popular. Considering it and wrath are seen as the golden days of WoW. I know I would jump ship to TBC and even more so for Wrath. I would not play any servers made for Cata and onwards. Game begins to feel different after that.
---
Yeah this is exactly why I was asking. I've farmed those wicked claws on private servers, so knew mathematically where a good place to get them was. But when it comes to WoW Classic, many of those numbers are up in the air. Even if they are 1-2% out, that makes a big difference for something that has a small drop rate.
---
No offense but if you are straight, you get to do that shit all the fucking time. Don't fucking tell me most people don't care -- you have no idea what it was like to hide who you like until you were 26 years old and still are having trouble with it at 45. Fuck you. Did you have to hide the fact you liked girls? did wanting human love almost fucking destroy you?
---
I dont, but i could pick it up and level it fast until i can skin STV, do i just vendor all the leathers? i read above that aint really worth to AH at this point.
---
Haha good one mate :D
---
Sometimes I find these bots just a tad annoying. Know the reason. But it is just a figure of speech. Oh well.
---
Why do people say leveling gets harder after level 20? What changes that makes it so much harder?
---
I've never played vanilla but I'd like to be prepared before hitting level 20.
---
Thanks for your response. 
---
Yes the world is immense and therefor most areas can be pretty empty. Thats sad sometimes! On the other hand you can level or explore the world in peace if you want to and afterwards try to get the best use from the new areas and the crowd there:-) 
---
Have a nice day!
---
This boss received a substantial nerf in patch 1.13 with the removal of the add that patrolled the area "Angwe".
---
I enjoy drama in game, from trade, general and even guild drama.
---
SO YOU ATTACK WHAT YOUR TANK HAS AGROO ON
---
Sign me up bb
---
Oh the laugh is so good. My friend got ganked at lvl 23 by 30 warrior, so i came to his rescue and we pickled his juice.
---
He got a good audible laugh on his corpse haha
---
I put someone on ignore that was was harassing folks in the Barrens chats about their "toxic masculinity". A bullshit gender war ensued. Please.. keep that bullshit out of our game!
---
Stop saying the word bot, nobody can prove that even if they did use some kind of automation to stay logged in. There are legit addons that auto invite people, you just whisper "inv" and you get invited. The timer to logout completely is very long so as long as they alt tab and press space bar and tab back in they're fine.
---
They still have to pay for the second subscription so they're not doing anything wrong. It's blizzard's fault that people can abuse it.
---
Let's assume the team is 20 people, working over 3 years which means the costs are about 8 million. That is 533 000 monthly or 44 000 annual subscriptions. Even if we double or triple the team size, add marketing costs etc. it can still be considered a financial success even if just \~200 000 people come back to wow for about a year.
---
Came to say this.

I like the class fantasy, to be a trickster, to have a solution for everything, especially with engineering which I think complements the rogue skillset phenomenally. 
---
I don't even mind the reagents I constantly have to carry.
---
THIS IS THE BEST COMMENT THANK YOU
---
Because that's a sequel. Your analogy doesn't apply here.
---
This is more like Public Test Region vs Live in Overwatch. It's the same game running two different versions. WoW classic is just a version from 15 years ago.
---
Locks are here boosting hps, they are the unsung heroes of wow.
---
What is up with these video, is lofi really good or just a trend ?
---
He will be leashed.
---
That ain't nothing though. That's scorn.
---
I'm pretty sure you can play it with a microwave and couple of potatoes.
---
The great thing about that is that if you remember his name, you might run into him later, as the server populations belong to that server only. This is perhaps one of the things I loved the most about vanilla, that you ran into the same people, both friends and enemies. There is also perhaps more incentive to be nice to your fellow player if you know you're likely to meet them again. Next time perhaps you help him (if you got his name).
---
Day 1 and 2 should have been human :-D
---
I just started playing yesterday and I love it so much. I have never played a game like this before. I played Diablo II when I was like 12 but not online. Now 12 years later this is the first PC game that I have ever played with other players besides stardew valley! It's insane and everyone has been so nice. My boyfriend and one of our friends have been helping me figure things out and I'm so hooked.
---
Nice dress.
---
If you're fighting with another person, open with a timed ambush so that you use it just before your energy ticks over.  Then you have enough for a backstab follow up immediately.
---
After that, sinister strike.
---
I didn't actually talent into backstab build at all.  I haven't even got improved backstab, though 37, 38 &amp; 39, will be where I go into that instead of finishing sword specialisation.
---
I don't think you need to worry about taking aggro. If there's 2 of you fighting one mob, ambush and backstab will be enough to bring it to about half health, then the two of you finish it off in seconds.
---
I hate it even more when they are on 2 hp and you are on 20% and then you miss, they parry and dodge and you end up spending a health pot.
---
I agree. A lot of old school healers are still fixed on the “heal the tanks at all times and only the tank” when in reality you gimp the locks dps which could make everything go much faster if they can chain cast. It’s not even a lot of effort just a HoT here and there or a light direct heal. It’s possible and optimal to heal someone other than the tank, especially if the tank is at 95% and you’re still fixated on them for some reason
---
You could have taken a photo with your phone of your tablet filming your screen in a mirror. You could also have taken a photo with your phone of a tablet filming your screen in a mirror, in another mirror. Also you could then print the photo, scan it, transform it into Jpeg and then export it to PDF before screenshotting it. And then take a photo with your phone of a mirror showing the tablet filming a mirror showing the screenshot in windowed mode on your screen.
---
Ok
---
im just RPing being a rogue man...
---
But that's the point , people, and myself, got sick of trying and talking to brick walls and pricks. Youve got rose tinted goggles on mate but none the less , good luck
---
I really don't think locks expect heals, I don't anyway. I just bandage or eat... and if there are ones that demand it they're entitled so just don't heal them?? Why are all the healers complaining, they're not forced to heal the lock or anything
---
Sorry you got to hang out with straight people your whole life. Oh no fuck that was great im sure sorry -- fuck me I will just play like a right cunt and not talk about sex at all.
---
Cause straight people never fucking talk about sex and they are So tired of hearing about it.
---
That helped a lot.
---
Thank you very much for that list
---
Your experience is just as awesome, if not more so, and i feel most long-time players will envy you. You get to experience everything for the first time. The wonder of seeing new things. The mystery of exploring unknown areas. 
---
I currently am watching a twitch streamer who is playing wow for the first time is classic, and he is enjoying so much. I feel all warm and fuzzy inside to see him experience all the wonder for first time, and grow as a player. So, you enjoy your time!
---
nope, not what they are talking about\^\^
---
Its a fucking horizontal idle game for your phone... A FUCKING PHONE GAME... and they just stole many assets of wow and put them somewhat randomly in their game...
---
What do you do that pays you 40 an hour for 15 hours a week?
---
You contradicted yourself, but OK
---
I'm pretty sure no one constantly jokes and says offensive stuff at your expense even without knowing you.
---
Have a closer look at the specs required for vanilla. My box says it requires Windows 2000, a 900 Mhz CPU and 32 MB of GPU Ram.
---
I remember it looking similiar, but that must be nostalgia lying to us, it cant possibly have looked anything like that back then. Having small CRT monitors probably helped.
---
Harsh on the giggle part, not everybody is a top comedian... ;)
---
I get that people with what they perceive as not "normal" traits say they go through a lot. However, OP was asking for an LGBT friendly guild, not a therapy group. They might be just fine and I think most guilds will be very friendly for LGBT people.
---
I know this was a while ago but I've seen 13k queues in classic lol
---
Well, you should not try that quest because if you do you’re gonna need that hotline haha :)
---
Thanks brother, gonna have my next toke there
---
Clique is pretty good, with Blizzard raid frames
---
Thank you!
---
I'm lvl 28 with 30 in herb, I just decided fuck it ill do professions when I get a mount.
---
Truth. Lots of shit tanks 😂
---
I am sure the same is true for you or OP. Constantly jokes... come on you drama queen (get it?).
---
Read the first post I made you oversensitive twat.
---
Never hid anything because I grew up in the culture you fear. I'm not straight. Been open the majority of my life. Most. People. Dont. Give. A. Shit. Especially in video games. Especially younger generations. If you dont ram your own insecurity down someone else's throat, they tend to not care.
---
After looking at a guide for it. I can believe it.
---
Yep, then east out of dun morogh, you can do the vagash quest on the way.
---
When leaving the zone: the north path leads to a quest to kill mangeclaw in dun morogh, the south path leads to the starting quests of loch modan.
---
&gt; This should be fairly obvious. 
---
It's not obvious. We have players who have no idea how threat works. It hasn't been problem like after TBC. Have to remember that not all players have experienced Vanilla and for some people threat simply means that tank should taunt that mob. 
---
So if you are tank and this happens try to explain that they just can't do it. Don't trust all players know about it.
---
Where do you live that’s it’s now the weekend?
---
What...?
---
A priest let me die before looting my chest. Never been more angry before
---
Shit tanks won't get invited to runs by better players, then
---
I have totally mixed feelings. I hate retail, I ended my proper journey in WOTLK. I only came back for a combined 3-5 months in Cata, WoD and Legion so it's nothing. And I promised myself I'll never touch retail again. But playing Classic for a week now at start brought me tons of joy and nostalgia, but as each day is passing by I'm starting to miss TBC more and more and because of that I'm even considering trying BFA. I know that BFA and TBC has nothing in common, but Classic (especially in P1, when I'm a huge BG fan) feels just boring after the first wave of excitement passes. News coming from the world about people abusing 10man SM farm and killing Rag after 4 days makes it even more sad and makes me lose that feeling that "i'm fighting for something".
---
And you fall for even more bait.
---
I must've killed like 40 turtles to get the 7 turtle shells I needed for the Q in thousand needles yesterday.
---
Someone really needs to realistically render someone entering the barrens and seeing all those zhevras without hooves, raptors without heads and other freaks of nature casually strolling around before 'welcome to the world of warcraft' appears  as title logo
---
And for some odd reason there's always a druid faster than Barry Cenarius, the "fastest" druid alive.
---
For every bag he makes I lower the price of 1 silver and 50 coppers!
---
More than 200.
---
&gt;can you even imagine?
---
Yeah I can, straight people live under specific stereotypes too such as mental health issues. Life is not that simple that by just being straight saves you from people's expectations. Also
---
&gt;NO ONE TELLS YOU IT'S OK TO LIKE GIRLS 
---
It's ok to like girls, it's ok to like whatever you like, it's ok to be you. Sincerely, a straight guy.
---
But I understand you a little better now despite you attacking me (*and frankly you're doing exactly what some asshats are doing to you, assuming based on my straightness that there is something wrong with me and you're entitled to be hostile towards me*). I hope you find someone who can relate to what you're going through, everyone needs a friend.
---
Would make more sense with Blessing of Wisdom rather than might as that is usefull for all the other buffers and not just druids.
---
&gt; It's a challenging system, with fixed rules, that rewards practice and eventual mastery.
---
There are a number of mage players from ELY/LH/NR/KR1-2-3 top guilds that **consistently** parsed at the top of their groups ( before nitestacks ). This would suggest that within a span of 30 minutes, moving around and pressing frostbolt there is enough complexity to allow for competition that has reached 15 years of mastery.
---
The game, in one of its simplest forms has complexity in abundance. So whats the deal with rotations again? 
---
Let me make an analogy for you: So competitive sprinting is a thing. Its a simple thing really, you go from one place to another timed. This sport has a lot of competition and there are a number of factors that determine the time of your run. That being said... running is a very natural thing... so how could we possibly complete in something any 4 year old could do? Well I think I have a solution this "problem"; we'll juggle balls. The skill ceiling of sprinting is obviously way too low, fuck, 80% of it is just how fast you move your legs. Complexity is what we're missing, its what we measure worth by. Come to think of it, sprinting is really stupid and simple, lets just fucking juggle.
---
&gt; And I'm sure you didn't mean to attack anyone or be aggressive when you described a group of human beings as "retarded ... neckbeards ... too fat to play ddr" :)
---
No I was aggressive, but not overly, the stereotype rings true and they know it. By the amount of discussion this topic gets and the criticism the game receives for this design aspect, it really seems like the hill people are fighting to death on, it really is retarded.
---
Can you buy me the expert cook book please on the way, thanks.
---
There are moments where you aoe
---
o7
---
I've looted everything and the only issues with bagspace I have is if i decide to do 4+ quests at once without vendoring
---
While it certainly looks gorgeous, it also looks generic and bland.
---
It's lost all of the great atmosphere and art style that made WoW what it is.
---
You act as if Horde players don’t also do this. I’ve got news for you, pal.
---
Puff puff give!
---
To be honest, any realm at this point has a lot more people playing on it than the actual vanilla servers back in the day.  Vanilla servers had a cap of about 2.5k people before being full and experiencing queue and Classic servers have about 13k cap. Even a "low" pop Classic server is bigger than a "full" vanilla one. Don't worry about it, just go and play the game.
---
Anathema.  Released Friday, never been a queue or mob competition.
---
Yeah, it's baffling. I love this game and always will, but many players - despite the abundance of wholesome behavior atm - are extremely toxic, as it's always been.   And "gamers" (hate that word tbh) usually aren't the most open-minded people, it personally made me unfollow most gaming subs. Some people don't seem to get how seriously damn old it gets to see sexist or homophobic comments ingame - and they probably don't notice them as much as people who are directly concerned by them, therefore concluding they don't exist. 
---
Good luck op, you're not alone in that boat and you'll definitely find good people in that sea of players!
---
Build and respec later, nearly any talent is better than no talents.
---
How about you just don't play lol
---
They, go for 5G on the auction House on my server. :(
---
I like Classic WoW, I vote for Independence for Classic
---
He didn't fucking say instance did he you twat? He said dungeon. You need a class in reading comprehension
---
I did this exact same thing the other day on my Hunter on Bigglesworth, leaving Darnassus to EK.
---
Fact. Did it today. Read online it was free but that was plain wrong
---
BFA is nothing like Classic WoW lmao. The only thing it has from classic is some lore and the name, that's it. It's two completely different games.
---
Nah, just hit evasion and do it yourself.
---
Trust your team. If the group says mage sheep moon then it's thw mages job to sheep moon and yours to not dot it. Let the mage be the one to make the mistake. If you're just too trigger happy then slow it down a bit, lower lvl 5 mans are a good place to practice what you need
---
Cringe of r/wow is spilling over
---
I'm sure you look for people to dungeon with in general chat and discuss things with them while you wait for more to join. And I'm sure you always try to find someone else before going on a "group" or "elite" quest so you can make a new friend out of it.
---
lvl 27 mage should i choose a chest that has +11 int or this duengon chest called Robes of Arugal? not sure if i want to lose -2 int for +10 spirit, +5 stamina (but looks a bit better)
---
Wow the edit really tells it all huh. Take a hint, find a regular nice and mature guild, and don't get offended by a stray dick joke in a small chat window from someone you don't care about. I don't like dick jokes either, but somehow I find a way to move on.
---
Sure, RNG is involved but when someone loots only every second mob he can loot because he can’t be bothered to walk those few steps to the corpse, then that’s not really on RNG then
---
Haha that’s great, I had this happen without even planning it out. Cleared a pack of mobs and looted the chest, left one trash item inside.
---
A little later 2 guys were waiting in front of the chest when there was one mob next to it. Waiting for me to pull it. I knew there was nothing left so just killed the mob while they instantly charged for it. Felt great. Did a /rofl but they probably didnt notice.
---
Have silver you made me chuckle irl
---
Are you making sure to grab new abilities to your hot bar?
---
Thanks for your response! 
---
I‘m not trying to shift the responsibility from the devs to the community alone. Everyone does their part and it ends in a vicious circle. 
---
People don’t socialise, blizzard „rewards“ this behavior by making socialising even less important and so on..
---
Both sides need to change.
---
Have nice day!
---
👏👏👏
---
Agreed! I unsubscribed immediately after reading this post. Then just to spite the losers who sit at home at type posts like this, I subbed to asmongold with twitch prime.
---
&gt; For PvE it's the main aspect of your gameplay, ofcourse it's a big deal.
---
Its not, it never was. We're playing classic, the rotations barely exist in this game. Slice and dice lasts 20 seconds, that's your fucking rotation, its glorious.
---
So who's whining? This whole thread and the point of it is condescending criticism towards the design aspects of this game's PVE.
---
And for goodness sake give the tank at least a couple of seconds to build up aggro especially if they're a low level. First time doing Deadmines last night the other DPSs kept going all in the instant the tank attacked and of course kept pulling aggro.
---
Easy there - I get that, just wanted to make OP aware of the fact that a lot of well meaning people haven't considered the issue
---
Sharding is shit. That’s right!
---
I...
---
huh?
---
... Ok.
---
They may play like completely separate games, but the fact still stands that the game is still called World of Warcraft as it always has been.
---
You want to respecc at 60. Certain talents like improved voidwalker and improved drain soul are must haves for lvling, but become very useless once you are high lvl. It would be a pain to lvl without those two, and a respecc isnt that expensive.
---
Coming only to an Epic store near you.
---
Or maybe even allow character copies.
---
It happened to me in retail a couple months back
---
Do you care about each stranger on the street? Most people don't. And folks from different realms are strangers that you will never see again. Why care about them? There is a limit to which you can fight against human nature, but we care about our small groups more than about large groups. Stranger in classic - part of your server, helping him - service to your community. Stranger in retail - just stranger, helping him is a waste of time. And that even excluding the fact that in retail no help is needed - all threats are weak and stomped by players boots into dirt (well, kotacu claims that scaling provides chalenging mobs, but I've never seen that - each and every npc provide no threat to player).
---
It might've been drop rates, not the values. Or they might've been preoccupied with something else and didn't bother to check.

I still feed my pet in retail even though it haven’t been necessary in years.
---
&gt; It’s an old version of the game we were all playing last month.
---
How ignorant can this be? Never touche BfA and never will, I'm sure there are millions of people who haven't touched BfA but came back for Classic.
---
Is that dude using a 21:9 ultrawide in portrait mode while playing on a normal  panel? I'm guessing refresh rate.
---
I personally played on a private server that had this enabled (it was crazy) and found on this subreddit that classic wow does not have it. So that's all I can tell you.
---
I got some good names on incendius and then my friends didn’t want to wait for queue and we switched to Kromcrush..
---
The main problem with playing with a controller is that you are very limited as to the amount of buttons you have  and your abilities will outnumber them, especially as a rogue, we have one of the highest numbers of abilities and we use them very often
---
As a low level its doable but later on, not so much. im level 19 and i cant imagine being limited to 8 buttons 
---
You could also try other gaming peripheral's like the Razer tartarus (https://www.razer.com/ca-en/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-tartarus-v2) or a trackball mouse
---
As for looting the fastest way is to shift+click for instant loot

These are two LGBT Gaming subreddits. You are probably more likely to find like-minded people there. 
---
This subreddit is so general, you post will be on page 2 or 3 before those who _actually_ know about anything related to LGBT guilds even read it.
---
That’s another issue. We tried to go from quests to mob grind and then realized mobs giving ~20 exp in Durotar. Like sure you can kill faster but that doesn’t really matter if mob respawn is your bottleneck
---
Just look at the fact they've released a version of the game that the lead developer literally laughed at the idea of releasing when a fan asked them. Just that alone highlights how much financial trouble they're in. After he ridiculed that guy at the convention releasing WoW had inherent negatives for the company, basically highlighting to shareholders how out of touch they are with a lot of players. It's chips away confidence and casts doubt over any current plans for retail.
---
Question about the priest talent spirit tap:
---
What do I need to do to get the bonus?
---
1.kill the whole mob by myself
---
2. tag the mob and party members do the rest of damage
---
3. Just heal party members and when they kill i get the buff.
---
Ty
---
I just activate auto-loot as standard, saves me the shift-pressing.
---
So, that wasn't the list of features that destroyed comunity?
---
I know you are joking, but I get 150ms and it's not that bad. I haven't had any issues at least.
---
i don't think not pissing off your healer ruins games
---
your 'ability to have fun ends' when you start hurting the gameplay of those that you play with
---
works everytime!
---
If you play on eu, try the two rp realms either rp PvP or rp pve depending on preference
---
I dont know why, but i have to watch it over and over again. It's so satisfying.
---
Im using the tool and the general chat, both. I‘m using communities, my guild and my huge Battle.net list. 
---
And I try to communicate or talk in chat. Yes. 
---
1g is alright if  it speeds up the leveling time.
---
I think it goes up everytime you use it :
---
1, 5, 10, 25 and 50g and then stays at 50 per use. You're allowed to make a mistake but using two different specs for PVP and PVE will cost a lot of money !
---
I hope Blizzard will go different way than TBC. For example using something from their early WOW beta build and implement Emerald Dream (as it was initially intended, looking at emerald dragons and portals they are guarding and which didnt work).
---
Going different direction from making wow easy and casual (as actual is now) is the game changer for me. I will drop the game if they will just re-release all expansions.
---
Wow classic was a phenomenon and going after expansions started to slowly kill it.
---
Get a threat meter addon, 
---
Immolate—&gt;agony—&gt;corruption—&gt; wans or shadow bolt depending on mana/threat. Generally you’re gonna be wanding at lower levels 
---
Once you’re 60 you’re just a walking shadow bolt spammer that throws up curse of elements and summons people. Occasionally in the ranks group for blood pact but that’s something for later. 
---
Happy leveling
---
It's an aesthetic that separates retail from classic. Blob shadows, textured water, less ground clutter etc just makes the experience feel more authentic.
---
Also, the game wasn't designed for these newer graphics settings which is causing some issues finding objects.
---
I think that change didn't come until TBC if I remember correctly
---
\^\^ You can find the scripts on wowhead )
---
Even with clues though, how would they prove it well enough to justify punishment?

I think [this thread](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/unofficial-lgbtqi-friendly-guilds-registry-advertise-here/249840) might be helpful. Anecdotally, it also feels like the RP community has a strong pro-LGBT vein. Even if RP isn't your thing, you might poke around on one of the servers to see if you like the vibe.
---
Good luck with your hunt!

bro get some keybinds

I love this so much.
---
I think it should be a separate sub, then we and blizzard would get a better idea what the community wants and can develop for it. I'm pretty sure Classic subs would outnumber retail subs at the moment (its expected, its a new release)
---
Maybe Blizzard will introduce a 59 - 60 level boost for $19.99.
---
OP you have some problem, I just looked at your comment history. Please consult.
---
\&gt; And as Classic has shown, it's the issue of the game itself and its systems, and not the playerbase. 
---
are you playing on classic right now? because a major part of people leveling have as only communication "lf castercleave x dungeon. be lvl x+" instead of queueing something up. then they aoe pull the shit out of the dungeon, rinse and repeat. i did play my fair share of classic since it was released and i may only be lvl 32 right now, but in terms of communication i can surely say that i don't communicate more on classic than on retail. for quests? not at all except for "lfm" or "inv please" if it's a named/elite mob with high respawn timers. 
---
if you use "why would you not talk if you don't need to" as an argument of why retail has less communication, well it is the playerbase, since it is a CHOICE, it is not the game taking it away. because in classic you only really "need" to communicate to find a group or look for more players. using "voids, blanks and boredom" due to how the game is as a plus in communication engagement for classic is kinda stupid to me. you might travel faster in retail (m+ for example) but you still have downtimes there too, while you look for a tank that sometimes takes up to 30 minutes, yet, there is no real communication out of boredom. so it REALLY majorly is the community that changed in regards of interactions between players, and the game changing is merely a cozyness factor that might enhance the perception of the whole thing.
---
What is love?
---
I think taking wand spec early is mandatory. You'll want to shield up, frontload with holy fire, get SW:P up, smite a few times and then wand the mob to death. When getting low, pop a renew on yourself. With this playstyle, spirit tap is also a good talent, so at 19 you'd optimally be 5/0/5 specced, after which you can move down tje shadow of holy tree.
---
r/nononoyes
---
No I actually play on a server with a queue to be with friends as well. But I also realize the choice I made comes with a price. I had the option to avoid queues and since I relinquished it I realize that I don't really have a way to justify complaining about queue times.

i highly doubt a blizz employee would give the items to another person instead of removing the gold/items completely from the market or simply banning the person.

yeah maybe a guy scamming people who buy boosts or the orginial account holder who delets his kids/brothers boosted chars trying to avoid getting banned in the future.
---
They do, please... it's not that complicated.

1. The +rifle skill just doesn’t factor in really.

2. Don’t know this. Would guess ~15%

My laptop has a GTX 1050 2gb of vram, i5 and 16gb ram.  Maxes classic quite comfortably at 1080p.  You don't need much at all to play this game.
---
I guess our playstyles are just differenry but flash heals are mostly for high level dungeons and unbeatable in raids (rank 1-2), at my level around 30 it's for emergencies only. Note I barely run out of mana unless tank pulls entire room and I have to keep up with the damage
---
1 - Any gun with a slower speed (3.0) being ideal, will give you highest DPS if you thread your shots correctly.  The +skill dwarves get just means you need less hit rating when using a gun.
---
2 - Depends on your spec completely.  
---
3 - You can absolutely be top DPS in MC and BWL... mages have to spec frost, rogues and warriors itemization is still pretty even with hunters, even warlocks have issues.  As a hunter, your biggest issue will be keeping your pet alive to add that extra DPS.
---
You seem to think all of the arguments are wrong. 
---
You've been given a pretty on-the-head answer but have rejected it due to your own perception of the situation.

It would seem fallacious to expect another opinion or point given to have any further influence on your view

Blizzard wouldnt do that they would just ban the account.
---
Now this situation got me thinking what if owner of account "bought" a service to level them or something but the seller of the service is a white knight that fights those services by teaching the buyer a lesson and giving away their stuff and deleting their characters? Would be very funny
---
While this is true, I would like Blizzard to know that I don't want to pay for retail all the time (sometimes is good) but I do want to pay for Classic, I wan't them to know that and with split subs they would, that's how I want them to spend my sub money, even if its just for servers
---
The question is why WOULDN'T you go aoe build? Your dungeon dps isn't gonna matter that much while you're leveling. Pugs aren't gonna be checking your numbers to see if they gotta black list you as long as you're actually doing something.
---
Plus aoe grinding dungeons with mages is some kind of Bs meta rn
---
Quality content
---
Oh jeez
---
It was past-midnight, IIRC.  
---
Because I think I saw exactly this conversation right before returning to Inn to log-off.

---
not at all comparable because i was 14 but i broke up with my first bf during TBC because he always wanted to hang out during my guild's raid times..... it was a good choice, though i DO regret not coming up with a better reason for why lmfao
---
You said it. Sword/Mace MH for leveling, always.
---
The fact that it's called World of Warcraft doesn't mean they are the same game like you claim. Doom 2016 is called the same as Doom 1993.
---
Lol, I'll wait until you zone out of the dungeon next time, sweetie.
---
Are you in &lt;MEMERS&gt;? I think i might have ran into you in Tauren Mill yesterday lmao
---
Your sister seems kinda stupid. I just empty the box and leave the box. I get the last cookie and I dont have to throw away the trash, its a win win.
---
You can feel how you want, the fact remains that the game is still called World of Warcraft and is not World of Warcraft 2.
---
I have no disillusions that they play completely differently and that they probably should be considered different games, but I also know that my opinion doesn't change reality.
---
As a shaman I can relate to this issue.
---
I'm blind, will delete then
---
I played with Shaman tank every dungeon until Ful'Farrak. It was great.
---
You're implying they should have given more meaningful coverage to other parties during the race. I explain both that they did and why they couldn't do more. It's a waste of time discussing any further though tbh because clearly you don't actually care and just want to shit on Method for not doing more while also not suggesting a single possible solution.
---
Make a hunter alt and weave those auto and melee swings baybee! It's like playing mage while tricking with a yoyo
---
She did say, unfortunately... Maybe she just needs someone to guide her? Perhaps she's intimidated by the game and just needs a nudge?
---
Playing the auction house from time to time.
---
Instead of avoid queues by afking, I am avoiding queues while making gold.
---
You regen when you cast too, only stops when you land
---
Yes, I play Classic and it has been a wonderful experience. Had more interaction in 1 evening of classic than in Retail since WoD. Organically grouping for quests is common, making deals on tagging specific named mobs (and actually honoring them), buffing people in passing, people just chatting about whatever.
---
And I didn't see a single LF dungeon cleave, just normal oldschool LFG and LFM, usually without any specific requirement, and if there was one, it was very reasonable (such as 19+ for DM). If the Classic experience is not like that for you, sorry, but it might be you who is the issue.
---
Dropped all of them in 6 kills. Lucky lucky day!
---
Yes, they can, but all that will matter to investors is dollars and cents. How many dollars are being spent? Plus, a lot of investors don't care about the industry, and honestly don't care that there's a difference in Classic/retail. They just want to see if they should dump their shares or if there's profit happening.
---
I understand completely. If it helped you a little to vent out, then I'm happy for you. "Wish I had a magic switch" etc. you know.
---
How can you be so angry about something that makes the game interesting for so many people? Part of the fun of online games in general is competition. If you literally only press one single button an entire boss fight then the only thing differentiating you from other players at all is your items. Where's the fun in that? I want to be rewarded for playing better than others. Taking the time optimizing your own character and your "rotation" (even though I hate this word, since it implies a certain amount of stasis even though in retail they're much more priority lists, since they are very dynamic) is what makes the game interesting for me and I assume many others.  
---
Everyone is entitled to their opinion and all - I can't wrap my head around you getting so salty about it or why you refuse to see why people like a more nuanced playstyle than just spamming one ability.
---
Sorry for being a bit rude but it becomes a bit annoying after a while having all this unwarranted questioning in other responses. I see that you meant no offense. My apologies.
---
It was on PvP.
---
i thought people weren't serious when they said get  the 8% movespeed for ret pallys, but damn, every single time some horde tries to run from me, with enough effort i can catch up and kill them through persistance
---
Dodging by 2%
---
Yep that’s the problem. Part of why I roll warrior cause the pvp armor that also is good for end game pve looks very good. On alliance side mind you.
---
Is that your wife's boyfriend?
---
uptight scum flag next to mighty horde flag? filthy casuals
---
IS ARMS or fury better for leveling in a group ? before switching to arms as fury at 40
---
So basically your'e saying punish everyone who asks for new layer in guild chat or global chat? It's exactly what they are doing expect they pay extra sub for it so they can do it themselves.
---
They can't though, because the people aren't around to do that and the ones who are, don't communicate! That's the point! There is no sense of community and helping each other , everyone just wants to grind dailies get better gear without having to talk to anyone, miserable as fuck
---
Classic, and the way wow used to be, had people in your general vicinity, wherever you went, being funny characters, discussing out loud about random shit that passers by can get involved in.
---
people who think that classic is that much better have rose tinted goggles. a big part of the not talking community from retail is on classic right now. 95% of their communications is lfg/lfm macros they spam in world chat. which is only a replacement for not having the group finder, so it really is not communication. the "real" communication and conversations are kinda kept to a minimum, comparable to retail. at least that is my experience from playing lvl 1-32 on classic servers since tuesday.
---
Indeed it isn't. A tool that plays the game for you is, even if it is just moving 1 inch to keep you from afking.
---
Just levelled to 15 here and moved to a higher pop. they are fairly empty already. At peak 1k alliance and 3k horde. (censused these numbers!) always a possibility more will join but... The world did feel emptier. One guy in storm wind ah at 7pm on Sunday is depressing.
---
&gt; Yes cuz its ridiculous to imply 1 button press is healthier gameplay than a pretty simple rotation.
---
What the fuck is healthy gameplay? Explain.
---
&gt; Rotations has been a core aspect of the gameplay longer that it hasn't (since around Wotlk).
---
Yea, climb on that hamster wheel then.
---
&gt; you started off calling everyone who puts value in rotations a fat necbeard.
---
Straight to the heart, didn't it?
---
&gt; If it's not your cup of tea, leave it alone.
---
Take your own advice: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/battle-for-azeroth
---
Taunt taunt taunt
---
&gt; As a low level its doable but later on, not so much. im level 19 and i cant imagine being limited to 8 buttons
---
You're not.
---
You can bind somewhere between 30 and 50 hotbar slots with something like WowMapper (depending on how many buttons you reserve for finer-grained targeting and such and whether or not you use Share/Options for abilities).
---
There's also a 16-slot "Utility Ring" for stuff like potions/scrolls/quest items/etc. 
---
Still possible for a Class's abilities to outnumber them of course, depending on how many ranks of stuff you use, but it's not nearly as bad as most people think when they hear "play WoW on a controller". 
---
The equivalent of three to four full hotbars' worth of slots is a decent starting point at least.
---
Some gear it is worth selling of the stats on it are good.
---
You need to have 50 cooking to start this quest.
---
200 mana usualy is around 500hp from regular heals and a bit more from hots.
---
Just use teamviewer
---
2. depends on your spec as well. If you specced in BM pet damage can increase massive. But when you would go Marksman Pet damage lowers. However your pet can still be useful. A wolf with Furious Howl for example increases the DPS of others.
---
Noob question alert! Are people recording their games as their playing, constantly?
---
I haven't followed so many things as they happened. This week after classics release I retroactively learned a lot of stuff that's been going on over the years, but when cata came out I pretty much just turned off on WoW.
---
At the time, the whole deathwing thing seemed like a good analogy for the WoW devs and how they seethe players. ''You wanna play our game? FUCK YOU AND GIVE ME MONEY, YOU'RE DEAD LOLZ!''. I never once appreciated being burned to death while trying to do my thing.
---
Is there an addon that compares and marks equipment stat differences? Like red for decreased and green for increased values compared to currently equipped?
---
I don't even have retail installed anymore, so I just see classic whenever I click on WoW tab =D. I also demoted Overwatch to the second on the list, so whenever I launch batte-net it takes me straight to wow classic :)
---
&gt; stand there for ages before a shot goes off.
---
Yeah, that one
---
When you kill each other. Can happen quite often with a warlock, the warlock die but the other die too soon after from dot.
---
Maybe Mr. T hacked the game and created 6 slot wool bags!
---
What healing addon do you like?
---
I disagree with that. I think a CoC/AE build might be a bit better than a standard Blizzard build.
---
He told you he was bi, and you still went off on this tangent to him. Even if I had an LGBT friendly guild honestly at this point I wouldn't want to invite you
---
I'm conflicted.
---
On the one hand I'm a fellow Hydraxian Waterlordian. :)
---
On the other hand you're alliance scum. :(
---
I guess i'll meet you some day and we'll just /nod at eachother. :)
---
Gotta hope a warr gets ws and dsnt play ah then : D
---
And hunters :)
---
i chose the rp-pvp cause i like the stricter name policy, the rp encounters and i don't have to waste much thinking if its the right server because there's only one rp-pvp. also the pop seems healthy and the queue is not too bad, 0-30 min max from 19:00 - 20:00 when im able to play
---
There are a lot of lgbt friendly guilds on zandalar tribe the PvP server which i play on. And generally the community is fantastic and very friendly
---
On anything more than 3 targets Demo Roar will build threat faster for less rage and you simply won't have the rage to spam Swipe in low level dungeons.
---
If someone says offensive stuff, then obviously someone will get offended. If they don't like people getting offended at them, maybe stop saying offensive things?
---
No I don‘t think all of the arguments are wrong. 
---
It’s just wrong to say, that classic has such a complicated rotation. 
---
Mages just spam blizzard/ frostbolt. 
---
The rotation argument isn‘t well chosen in my opinion, but I didn’t say, that all your or other arguments are wrong.
---
Its absolutely broken to the point it takes away from the classic tanking experience, spam demo shout and enjoy your BFA threat, just pull enough mobs so that you get alot of rage.
---
Can’t wait for my +20 item lvl increase from bwl
---
Your group should be letting you slap sunders/build a bit of extra rage before they all start aoe burning
---
I suck at timing Mindblast for spirit tap, but I find in unnecessary mostly.
---
Only times I need to drink is when going Cleave\Spell-Cleave AOE grinding.
---
That shit gets me thirsty AF.
---
Full shadow spec also, so don't have spirit buff. I do have almost full blues though as I've been spamming dungeons for the past 3-4 levels.
---
You said it, you have friends wanting to play with you. This should do a lot for your experience :)
---
I miss updated cat and bear models, though &gt;_&gt;
---
You call them the same shit while also rudely declaring they are in fact not the same shit. Nice.
---
Okay, but how does mixing classic and BfA subscribers stop them from knowing these things? They can find it out even if the subscribers aren’t being kept apart.
---
&gt;every genocide after that is not my fault
---
And you are still yet to get your first kill
---
Yeah, no.
---
oh another setup catching a boat by the slimmest of margins vids. awesome. especially because this is totally not setup. great work op
---
Who says it? How does it exploit? What are the consequences other than being able to party up?
---
Not sure how this is a problem? Just tell your friends not be lazy and loot.... Or get new friends that do.
---
If you go east toward tarren mill, a NPC will give you a quest to go to the city. He is in the begining of the zone (Hillsbrad Foothills)
---
Well, I know you meant your list as just helping people understand why, but it's not set up that way. 
---
Anyway to all those people, I believe in the pursuit of pretty much anything in life things get pretty much braindead and have the capacity to confuse newcomers.
---
This applies to picking up skill and grinding it out till you've achieved something.
---
But the tediousness and superfluous nature of it makes it memorable and prized. So it was with oldschool games wihh non-instant gratification.
---
Too much grass, tis not classic.
---
Imagine having anxiety over a game existing.
---
sry i am a blizzard main i dont like the other spells
---
Of course it is nice to have peace sometimes xD But People don't want that hence why they wish for classic too.
---
It is not like retail is completely dead don't get me wrong but it is not alive compared to classic.
---
Also - instead of defending your original Argument why do you just try to discredit/take the value out of arguments against your post?
---
Can't you defend it?
---
And again. I wouldn't socialize if I didn't have to as much. That doesn't mean that I don't like sozializing it just means that I usually decide not to when I don't necessarily have to.
---
Classic give loads of those chances to socialize out of necessity.
---
Retail just doesn't.
---
This! Of God, this !
---
&gt;He is tainting the experiece
---
He is literally not interacting with you at all and has no effect on how you are playing the game. That's not tainting your experience. If he got his stream to camp your corpse for hours on end then I would say he's tainting your experience. Otherwise he's "playing the game his way at his pace" which is what so many of you whiney nerds were all about before you realized that not everyone thinks exactly the way you do.
---
Talking about 15 years ago. We have history to reflect upon after seeing the direction the game went to fully appreciate what we've been provided nowadays.
---
Finally a decent answer, thanks
---
Protection is not amazing in pvp but you can flag carry in wsg. A speedy fc is better at getting away and across the field quickly. But if you have to hold the flag for a while and they come to kill you then prot warrior is great
---
I love how you rotate your camera once you land.  It’s almost like your in disbelief.
---
Im currently rocking the Blackwater Cutless, which is nice for me right now.
---
That one, yes, thank you.
---
I get that, but it is good for us too because then current WoW will still get supported (and hopefully improve in the future).
---
what settings are you running it at? and is the display aa bad as everyone says?
---
I didn’t meant to say, that this is a reason not to like classic! I like classic myself. 
---
I just tried to make a suggestion to improve everyone’s (or almost everyone’s) retail experience. 
---
As I stated out, this won’t fix major issues retail got anyway. 
---
Blizzard needs to change the current balance between SP content und group content in the open world, indeed!
---
And you could be right with your last sentence. You get gear too early too easy and can’t appreciate most of the time.
---
&gt; You lvl your toon, you find better gear
---
you pay to lvl your toon, you pay for boost in mythics, those are not rpg mechanics, those are mobile p2w games characteristics. you virtually pay to get everything(gear, xp, achievments) YOU DON'T DESERVE. YOU PAY SO THE GAME GETS PLAYED FOR YOU. 
---
that sucks and its not an rpg
---
'A little more tolerant'
---
They give us a Pride Month, parades, event, marriage rights, and so much more. Despite how much the few pride event I attended disgusted me, we still have them representing the acceptance of us in wider culture... what more really needs to be done? I prefer to enjoy dick in peace, personally 
---
I get it, you are older. A different and less accepting generation. Let go of the past and move on
---
Pink shamans are just wrong. I want them blue. Is there a way to fix it?
---
Is a mace any good for rogue? I assume on a Human it's ok, as they have both sword and mace specialisation.
---
I bought a bunch of gold on vanilla. I don't really feel bad for it. 
---
it's the same thing as buying a token with real money, and using it to get gold ig. Expect that blizzard took 12years to implement legally the system.
---
in my defence when i said that last line i meant a more general "you're not funny" that applies to anyone rather than you specifically
---
Yeah the folks just had a heated gamer moment!
---
What. Why lol?
---
wait, is this thread about the bagspace or not getting a skillup ?
---
What is D2?
---
Think ALL THE THINGS will show what it is used for...
---
Not at PC to check but I know it does highlight quest items.
---
Thanks for the skinning info, did you vendor everything or sell on AH? I haven't made much at all from skinning.. Just turned 30 last night.
---
It was the same in vanilla, why would it get nerfed?
---
Hope to get 20 soon :)
---
Yeah, sorry to see you had so much unhelpful commentary derailing your question. Hope you don’t let it phase you. There’s too many people on reddit who are just looking for fights.
---
/r/CliffsThatGrip
---
I haven't been addicted to a video game like this is years. I've logged 6+ hours a day the last 3 days and 4+ since launch. I cant stop playing!
---
The people who complain about simple rotations surprisingly often overlap with the people who are shit at PvP and seek validation in killing pants-on-head retarded AI.
---
This was in vanilla.
---
yeah it sucks. not sure what your point is
---
&gt; How can you be so angry about something that makes the game interesting for so many people?
---
I'm not, it doesn't even exist in the game I play.
---
&gt; Part of the fun of online games in general is competition
---
Yea, no shit.
---
&gt; If you literally only press one single button an entire boss fight then the only thing differentiating you from other players at all is your items. 
---
I understand that some people don't offer much more than their key presses to their groups, must suck for their groups eyhh. On a more serious note, I've already mentioned that the dps leaderboards on parsed fights in vanilla have people placing very consistently, regardless of gear. This must mean there are other ways to "differentiate" yourself from other's, so whats the issue? 
---
&gt; I want to be rewarded for playing better than others.
---
Ok, you can want that, and you'll probably get that as-well. Depends on what kind of content you seek from the game. What kind of reward were you thinking of?
---
&gt; Taking the time optimizing your own character and your "rotation" (even though I hate this word, since it implies a certain amount of stasis even though in retail they're much more priority lists, since they are very dynamic) is what makes the game interesting for me and I assume many others. 
---
You can optimize from sunset to sundown in classic. We've bin doing it to great effect for more than a decade now. Whats the problem?
---
&gt;  I can't wrap my head around you getting so salty about it or why you refuse to see why people like a more nuanced playstyle than just spamming one ability.
---
I'm not "salty", I'm triggered by the constant barrage of insecure retail players and elitists, complaining about the lack of ball juggling in the 1000m sprint. That's literally what this thread is, a jab at "frost mage rotation".
---
I think all eu just crashed
---
Crybabies. You can avoid gank squads and get to layer with resources and mobs up gaining advantage.
---
They also say that runing raid dungeons in raid is exploiting exp (and that was already fixed).
---
I got that :)
---
I'm glad it's actually something useful, I think the only other BoE epic I've ever gotten was the fucking lion horn of stormwind
---
Each new rank of righteousness is usually a minimal increase on the level it is available to be trained it but it scales after a few levels.
---
You can reset spawns to powerlevel, you can reset chest spawns to make insane money, which someone was banned for yesterday according to himself. You can most certainly exploit layering.
---
J4ckiechan. He usually streams hearthstone and i competitive in it but is playing classic for the moment. He actually just started today
---
I've made it my personal mission to buff every undead player I come across with Unending Breath, as if the racial 300% more breath wasn't enough.
---
I feel like the entire community is trolling me. It's not a fucking difficult concept. You bolded exactly what I meant, but you still say it's "included with BFA".
---
BfA is not a game. Its an addon of various other addons to Vanilla WoW.
---
Hi zipzo, what server are you on now?
---
It went down hard
---
People are quick to say "it's about karma" whenever anyone does anything in reddit, but I don't think that's actually the case most of the time.
---
This guy obviously has watched a lot of Asmongold. He's passionate about the game and the "spirit" that has been toted around, and when he saw that Asmon didn't meet his expectations, he was so disappointed that wanted to make everyone else know how much he was let down.
---
It's never about the karma. People just want their opinions to matter and be validated.
---
Because it meant the game was more spoon fed.
---
I do this too. Also instant ignore on people straight up disrespecting other players by talking their native language in chat even though someone asked them to use english..
---
You don’t need 40, you don’t need to be max level, you don’t need fire resist gear...
---
Yeah I’d say LFR was easier personally. 
---
But it’s marginal, neither are hard.
---
If they do that in any phase but 1 it'll be bullshit.
---
Rank 14 on a dead server getting brought to a full server wont be comparable, having farmed all the matts on a full server, xfer to low open the gate get the mount, come back?
---
Vanilla wasnt designed for xfers, especially not with people today that use every possible advantage like layering, or server xfers to reset their raid content
---
+
---
Oh good, I was worried I was getting screwed in a way.  Early game I am but.. if it's true then phew.  Seems Pally is... a very odd child in classic.
---
I think ItemTooltipProfessionIcons is what you’re looking for.

Heh at least the Qs bk then weren’t half the size of the ones today

Read this on the toilet. Very apt

lol I was waiting for this response
---
&gt; To take a screenshot of only part of your screen: Hold the Windows logo key and Shift and press the S key
---
So I've learned something new today. I've been using Windows all my life but never knew this was a thing always having to crop things afterwards in an editor. Thank you!
---
BlueShamans is an addon. It changes it back.
---
You are calling people casual, while complaining that people are leveling too efficiently...think about that, let it sink in, take a deep breath and stop complaining that other people have fun in their own way that has no effect on your little limited world.
---
OP hasn't said anything about wanting to explicitly talk about that stuff but that should be besides the point anyway.
---
I’m basing this on both my experience and that of my friend group and guild mates. I’ve played WoW for years, as have they and we’ve been in countless guilds. We’ve still never encountered someone who is anti LGBT. Also, most people know nothing about your personal life anyway, I’ve never told anyone in game my sexual orientation and yet some of my best memories are in WoW. So the simple solution is don’t tell someone something they both don’t need to know and likely case don’t care about.
---
With dungeon help less than two days of playing. Buddy is using it, gave him four dungeon runs and he hit 26 following it.
---
AAP so far for me has been quite shit to be honest. 
---
Questie or ClassicCodex are my go to with MonkeyQuest.
---
Shit is cheap as shit.  Most things auction for vendor prices.  Things that would sell for 10+ gold sell for less than 1.
---
We all deal with them, therefor the need for a "LGBT Friendly" guild is redundant.
---
lol I was waiting for this response.
---
As a noob hunter, what professions should I get into for gold making?
---
Before the end content your spec doesn't matter. Especially since some specs will be awful to level in solo. For example holy Pala or Priest. But it won't hurt to have some gear to help your task. As a Paladin have some gear ready with int and spi for example. No matter if it's cloth, leather or mail.
---
Same for warrior. Keep a decent shield and main hand around and skilled up and you shouldn't have troubles in dungeons as long your party doesn't act really stupid. And in that case even full prot spec won't help much.
---
Quite different really. Asking for casual, pvp, or raiding guilds is about a goal for gameplay. Not a desperate cry for attention or acceptance. I dont give a rat's ass what people think about my sexuality. I care about the game I want to play. And wouldn't you know, I tended to find friendly places with needing all my guild mates to avoid offensive jokes...
---
As far as I know, no range condition is possible for macros.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemtooltipprofessionicons
---
So nice. You will never forget that upgrade 30 DPS!!!
---
Yes.
---
Around 18+ the zones you play in will be contested (names of the zone in yellow) and it will automatically PvP flag you which makes enemy factions able to attack you on site and you the same. Now if you go into enemy territory (red names for the zone) you will be flagged but the other faction is not forced to be pvp flagged so they can walk up and just jump you.
---
The wife hard at work monkaS
---
Tho, this is only true if it seems like it is worthwhile to change. If WoW 2 is basically the same game then it might piss off people.
---
Classic certainly has a better sense of community and accomplishment for long term play. As opposed to retail where you can pretty much play it solo save for group content, classic is more difficult and promotes helping other players to complete quests and run group content. If you're looking for more of a group experience, I'd say to try out classic. 
---
In my own experience, I played retail when Cataclysm came out and off-and-on until classic came out and I can personally say that classic feels way more fun. Retail now just feels like a mindless grind. Try both and see which feels like an MMO
---
Personally I feel like this is only going to be a problem lvl 55+
---
I'm currently an elemental shammy healing dungeons.
---
There is a 10 hour window after the first turn in where other people can get Scarab Lord and the mount.
---
Theres an amazing feature in the game called chat, that allows you to ask questions to other players, therefore avoiding situations like this.
---
don';t think of this as a spectrum where people are either LGBT friendly or anti-LGBT. we're not talking about unashamed bigots here.
---
Ultra everything except liquid, which i have on low.
---
Omg
---
How do I hold mobs/generate aggro when tanking? 
---
I play a warrior and at level 21 I struggle so much holding more than 2-3 mobs at me.
---
What is the best order to keep mobs interested in me?
---
I know that DPS should be downing my target first and that seems to be working with a single elite or bosses. They're always on me and it works like a charm but the second we pull a pack of 3-4 mobs and people start AoE and stuff, the mobs just go all over the place and it takes me a while to get them back.
---
I know that healer is my priority and if DPS pulls too much they're kind of on their own but it feels like it's me that does something wrong.  
---
So far I only run WC a few times and even though we didn't wipe or anything it felt like I was not doing it right.
---
That being said, this is my first ever experience with tanking so I don't really know what is right and what's not.
---
Also, is there a macro that would allow me to go to battle stance, charge and then switch back to defensive stance?
---
Butters, only I get to be the Dwarf character!
---
20 hrs a week for 12 weeks is 240, and so is 40 hrs for 6 weeks.

Benediction has been a great home so far. High pop during peak, little to no que and zones are always bustling with people. It’s PvP EST.
---
Ratchet ftw
---
What level is recommended for BFD?
---
And where to level at 20?
---
Hehhehehe
---
God, I wish we did know who made this
---
Oh god. This reminds me of my horrible Gnomer run. Druid kept running ahead when healer was out of mana or would just pull random shit. After a single wipe on the dark iron dwarves, two dps left. Finally after managing to refill the group and finally get to the boss(with more wipes) bombs completely murdered everyone. Only barely managed to kill the boss by kiting him and several bombs around until I could finally get an execute off. 
---
I hate Gnomeregan.
---
My bond with this fella is too strong so I might not switch it.
---
I've made it to 19 as a Prot Warrior and it's not terrible.  Not nearly as fast as pure DPS classes, but unless you respec and go Fury you're not going to be doing amazing DPS anyway.
---
I just switched to aoe yesterday and it makes questing a lot better. Pull small packs to get comfortable doing it then you're golden.
---
As someone who has shadowmourne I doubt they had 5. I think at the end of wrath we had maybe 3 players that had it.
---
I’m the same. I haven’t felt like this in years about a game. All I wanna do is go home and continue to level!
---
I had a lag on the Redridge quets yesterday and the quest failed a few steps before the end. Because I didn't follow close enough (due to the lag)
---
It's bad game design *in your opinion.*
---
We’re lucky if they turn it off before 2020.
---
All you need to turn down is ground clutter.
---
Same here, cant even go to any bnet site.
---
I never sit at 100% health. Wasted health p/5 is just wasted mana p/5, and I ain't about that.
---
My priest is in the 30s and our other buddy who is a warrior is also. AAP does not consider dungeons. Think he made it in about 24 hours played, maybe less.
---
U can do anything u put ur mind to mate. Don’t let anyone bring u down
---
This one I disagree with, you can both get one level if you share. Whereas you can only get the one level from the initial tick.
---
Since when did taking ss’s with a phone become popular? I remember ages ago it was probably the worst thing you could do and everyone would give you shit, but nowadays everyone does it.
---
This seems to be an issue between some ISPs and Battlenet. 
---
I'm personally using Bahnhof (Sweden) and it died for me. I turn on my VPN and voila, it is now working.
---
Thats some goddamn crappy music
---
Ha! 2nd language + 2 in the morning does that :)
---
at first everybody needs to sink 900g into epic riding, so the first months a lot of gold will leave the system
---
I got the ghost saber and because I'm not a big pvper I think I'll level him to 60 instead of trying to get brokentooth.
---
Maybe.
---
&gt;Not a full group
---
It was a full group.
---
&gt;not all 60
---
Vast majority of them were level 60 with multiple pieces of pre-raid BIS / decent gear on.
---
&gt;One shot it.
---
This is a guild that has been living on Vanilla WoW private servers for years now. They've cleared Molten Core hundreds of times.  I would expect that they one shot it. Your average guild isn't going to one shot Rag.
---
&gt;Vanilla wasn’t that hard, we were just shit players on the whole.
---
Players are still very shit today.
---
Nah you could've just answered the question without stroking your ego by flexing your game knowledge on noobs.

I had it drop too. Was never so angry about getting an epic.

Yeah, that's the one, man! Haha, it's a crazy quest. Classic is the best!

Hi, /u/sircool69

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cz2yu4/are_the_metrics_on_the_hoard_to_alliance_split/). 
---
I don't have to say anything as a healer in a tough quest hub, people befriend me just because I'm the only reason that harpy pack didn't wreck them. Healing makes friends!
---
Wait... did you jut take a photo of yourself taking a screenshot of the computer with a phone? like dahfk :O
---
I Didnt say it resets your melee swing. Though i realize i could have worded it better as you did. 
---
However i base that on private servers. And so far ive felt a fair amount of difference compare to those. So more testing is required as you also say.
---
Fair enough I probably picked up the wrong Karma in this thread sorry if I came over passive aggressive :)
---
You are right - we should all try to see the positive more. 
---
Srry
---
Same here, Swede using Bahnhof as ISP
---
Literally every priest does this. Respec at 40 to get Shadow Form and then respec again around 56 - 60 if you want to focus on Healing.
---
Sure. Just make Sure you skill Illumination and praise the Light. Paladins can be excellent healers
---
I would but I sold my silk bandages to buy kidney shot LOLOL
---
Yeah, people will frequently organize something then announce it in trade channel for a while in case any randoms want to join in.
---
Blackrock depths. It's a level 52+ dungeon in the searing gorge
---
But this only shows Baron Geddon. What's the roation for the other bosses?
---
See the real trick is to almost pathologically avoid responsibility for your whole life.
---
Managed to get to 33....Played a bunch the first week, now gotta work...hopefully I can get to 40
---
Tips for levelling as shammy? Keep running out of mana even as enhancement. can't decide between a 2h staff or a 1h and a shield. Also which stat should i aim for mainly, agility or strength? Thx
---
I'm using that provider as well
---
I member the days when everyone had CRTs that weighed 2 tons and LAN cables that went from PC to PC instead of going to a switch. Those old coax cables were such a pain in the dick. Try connecting 12 people's PCs with 2m/3m long cables. Oh and you had to buy a network interface card to even be able to do LAN stuff. Now get off my lawn.
---
i'll have you know i have over 300 confirmed honorable kills. you're fuken ded kiddo
---
You had me at penetration.
---
Being an altoholic I'd love to know how to get level 18 in 4 hours. I'm pretty sure not all classes would be that fast (cough, holy priest) if he's soloing that is.
---
Yes it's great. Blessings are also bonkers strong.
---
You'll be wearing a cloth dress most of the time which is unfortunate though
---
Ever since Mcconnell did that 10hr sea shanty stream everyone else has been playing it lol.
---
I always press windows and type "snip" and click the snipping tool. It's a lot easier to do that if you just want a pic of part of your screen, because then you don't have to go find the SS in your folder and crop it.
---
It’s useful in BFD ...
---
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
No it is not wrong - you are right. It just seemed that you were disagreeing with everyones comment. 
---
Of course you see the positive yet it still Comes over (on reddit via just text) like you always want to have the final word and are always right.
---
I guess I was in a bad mood and misunderstood the meaning behind your comments &lt;3
---
Well retail has insanely improved spell effects etc.  but its definetly A LOT nicer and ”softer” looking than what private server clients ran.  Specially the water and character texturer are most notable
---
I *think* it’s still in. Someone got to the Dancing Troll Village in a stress test at least.
---
Paladins are great at tank healing, any guild worth their salt is gonna want to bring at least 2-3 paladins
---
Bonebiter requires you to clear SM cath. The final bods is 42.
---
Horde players are better in every way. That's a well known fact.
---
Also using Bahnhof (Sweden) with problems.
---
To add onto this a bit, it's probably not worth being holy until you can get at least Illumination maxed. Perfectly fine after that point.
---
Hint: numbers are off on the private servers.
---
The guy's literally just bumping the keyboard against his head with Frostbolt bound to Spacebar
---
The issue I have here is I have literally never mentioned my sexual orientation to anyone in game. Additionally no one in any guild I have ever been in have mentioned their sexual orientation. The only way it’s possible to be targeted for something like that is if you give out personal information that doesn’t need to be given.
---
Squirrel !
---
Tack för att du upprepade exakt det jag skrev.
---
Get a damn life you virgin, who brags about playing Vanilla? lmao
---
1. An Image would be great!
---
2. I see, I'll look into that. 
---
3. It depends. Cancel Makro might be useful to not break stealth or sth. Who knows.
---
4. I am using the scanning target Method. How/why are you using auto attack to target something?

I had this same experience in retail a year ago, juuuuuuuust saying.
---
"YOUVE NEVER PLAYED CLASSIC
---
NO YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED CLASSIC
---
I PLAYED CLASSIC IN A BETTER ECONOMY SO I KNOW MORE
---
IVE EXPERIENCED VANILLA WAY DIFFERENT TO YOU" 
---
This is how idiotic you both sound.
---
I wouldn't be surprised.
---
This man here has seen the truth!  
---
I am also on a 10am to 6pm working schedule so in the evening when I arrive home at close to 7pm it's impossible on Mograine. Queues are about 3 hours long. So I do my usual IRL business, listen to music, watch a movie, read a book etc. I go to sleep at 10pm and wake up at 3:30am. I play from about 4am to 7am, then do my daily 1 hour weightlifting routine and at 8am I start getting ready to leave for work (at 9am).  
---
At 4am the server population is on a Medium level, normal and boss mobs for quests are always there, I can go around without clicking on 10 players per square meter as well. Worked very well so far for me during the first week.
---
I will continue to think you did not camp a druid who can easily shift and get away. 
---
Yes I will
---
Remember that a lot of underlying mechanics have changed over the years in retail, like how aggro works for example. In retail a tank uses one skill and all the mobs are glued to them, no matter how much damage the DPS dish out. In vanilla/retail the DPS have to be very careful with aggro generation, because one unlucky crit and suddenly Onyxia decides she'd rather hit that mage at the other end of the room, tailswiping and wiping the raid in the process.
---
Quiver as second bag...
---
I'm going to die before I have the time to kill you :D
---
Back in the day, one of our locks would life tap to death if it looked like we were going to wipe 'cos apparently it didn't affect item durability/repair costs. I got a lot of abuse when I instinctively clutch healed him.
---
Shows how different people react to potential wipes. As a healer you can't exactly stop.
---
Good bot!
---
Eyyyy
---
I have the same ISP in Sweden and turning on VPN did not work for me.
---
Show er.
---
No, it’s the list of the things I don’t like about retail
---
You have a choice to make between optimal leveling speed via dungeons vs leveling in the world to enjoy the journey to 60, remember optimal isn't always the most fun and the joruney to 60 is one of the best parts of the game to most people. Oh and another con to add to you're list for dungeons is the fact that you get sick and tired of some of the best dungeons in the game which can ruin the experience if you go back to leveling an alt and don't wanna spend time there.
---
That's what OP is suggesting, and to be fair, it IS a different game, but I just don't think OP's idea is viable.
---
Mage AoE mob grinding.  
---
I spec'd into this last night and had a go with some success. It's not that difficult to pull off, however, it appears that mob competition is huge! There's always like 50 mages at the same spot waiting to farm, so one bad pull/gank feels like it sets you back dramatically.  
---
Also, not having frostbite is a major pain in the but for any 1v1 situation.  
---
Is AoE spec really the way to go? I feel like it would only be optimal if everything went perfect (no mob competition etc.) which seems very unlikely given how populated the world is right now.
---
sneaky sea shanty 2 in there.
---
Huh? BFA released August 14th. On August 10th ATVI was $70 a share, by the 28th of September ATVI was worth $83 a share.  
---
Then COD came out and generated the same revenue as the previous version ($500 million) and shareholders were expecting growth instead of stagnation which lead the value of the stock to drop back down to the early 70's.  
---
Then at Blizzcon Diablo mobile got announced and the stock value dropped over $20 over the following week or so.  
---
Activision Blizzard isn't WoW or bust.

Shit sometimes I dont even need the renew. Cannibalize every minute. Or just don't lifetap more than I need for the pull we're on. I'll get the hp back eventually.
---
for the Nifty pocket watch (trinket that gives you sprint with a 30m CD) quest chain in badlands. if you grab frost oil, Gyronomicon(sp), Lesser invis pot, and a health potion before you go there, its an easy free-ish 4 bars. and probably your first trinket. I was level 43 before i had my mount, the trinket saved me once or twice
---
Yeah, Bahnhof here as well, turned on VPN and it's working again.
---
&gt;90% of retail rotations is stupid simple and a 10 year old could do it at the max level
---
Pretty contradictory to "most rotation being fine". I agree that most specs became worse with bfa (mainly because of the gcd change) but not to such a degree that you make it out to be. BFA sucks, I agree but not because the rotations.
---
DH can be complex if talent it that way. The dmg output is about the same but it's not as consistent as the faceroll one.
---
I only tested Fury in the pre-patch but to me they improved it from it's legion state. Hectic and enjoyable imo.
---
Wheelchair-ret is indeed easy. But ALL specs doesn't have to be complex.
---
Come back brother. We need you.
---
While this is true, I would never take a lvl 60 boost for example. I just play the game. I like dungeons a lot too so I usually go through low level instances 3 times on average. If there's crazy drops I really want I can run it 6+ times.
---
Oh you can actually tag with Warrior, during charge cast Thunder Clap when you are nearing the mob, or Hamstring. Leeway helps so you don't have to be literally on top of the mob to hit it.
---
I bet she doesn't even use thunderclap, nub
---
Why? I do home offices and sometimes I play. Usually you don’t have to be hyperfocused for 8 hours every single working day. Sometimes you are waiting for an e-mail or some input from stakeholders.
---
Just wait til phase 2 m8. The wpvp is coming.
---
Holy shit there are so many gatekeepers in this community it's insane
---
I'm not really a main part of the guild. I just know the guys and played with them years ago. But they're welcoming 😂
---
Quality post. As a priest I will always ask the tank if they want PW:S on a pull, some do most don't due to the rage issue. I get tired when less experienced tanks give me abuse for NOT PW:S them. :shrug:
---
In my honest opinion, the biggest difference between classic and current day wow is that classic actually feels like an RPG. The classes all have a unique identity and there is a solid difficult level in place too, you cant just pull a ton of mobs and kill them with ease if you're soloing. Most of the time you need to read the quest text so you know where to go and what to do. Modern mmo games don't even encourage you to read or listen, they simply give you a waypoint, and most players will just go to the waypoint without a clue as to why they are going there.
---
Hehe I'm not native too - may be the mix out of both :P
---
Best regards :)

OP is a massive scumbag.

how is your work's  network allowing connections to battlenet?
---
Holy shit extreme rafting
---
I have however started to notice that the classic atmosphere is seeping into retail people seem to be nicer and happier to help which is nice tbh I think classic will have a positive effect on retail which can only be a good thing in my opinion
---
Oh yep, you should have gone to a pvp server.  It does allow for open pvp anywhere on the map though, if youre not huge into PvP it can be frustrating.

Was so happy when I figured this loophole out back in the day. I remember it was how I got all the exploration chieves in wrath. Took forever. But it was fun to do.
---
Ha! Nice. Now I'm going to watch the docks for others attempting this, and hopefully fail
---
I use my work one, but i think NordVPN is good.
---
If you position your self in starting areas and sell wands, you can sell them well above AH prices.
---
When I started playing WoW in Vanilla I thought: well Im not a greedy person so Il not gonna greed, so Ill need instead since I could use the money. 
---
Took me a long time until I understood it was the other way around.
---
 Classic + sounds awesome but I think era Server where cool too with every expansion separated
---
Also down, swede with bahnhof here.
---
VPN to the rescue
---
Search "Nobbel87 history of wow" on YouTube. There are tons of videos explaining the world. One is even specifically made for classic wow. Enjoy.
---
Meanwhile I'm still waiting for my 30 silver from a guy that never came online again *cries in poverty*
---
As you said, it's a release of a Blizzard game. Blizzard games in general always receive huge amounts of attention when they release either a major update (patch or expac) or a new game. Even BFA had more than plenty of interest for the first month.
---
Either way, even a few months down the line blizzard can just compare (average) hours played on either versions of the game and make decisions based on it. If the linear progression and non-RNG features are more welcomed by the playerbase in the form of more hours spend on classic than on retail they will know the answers to what players want. That's literally how titanforging and co. were deemed to be better than previous methods, since the devs said so themselves.
---
That's a monumental achievement. I truly congratulate you. I am hoping when phase 2 hits you help you paladin friend get his class mount. 
---
So early in-game to have the epic mount. If you don't have gathering professions, you may want to consider getting mining/herbalism just to take advantage of the black lotus and mithril nodes.
---
That’s part of the reason I like healing. Every encounter is a little different and you’re always making on the fly decisions.
---
Jesus people in this thread are so dumb.
---
Its our most efficient one, and I get 15% more from Improved Renew :).
---
Probs doesnt even got Taunt, absolute casual
---
So many clueless wonders posting auctions below vendor price. You can't fix stupid.
---
I was getting 9 rage after charge and rend required 10.
---
Also how the company laptop allows installation of random programs? Probably it is a small company with not so up to date security.
---
This pserver is clearly stock mangos mobs do way too little damage. Fresh when?
---
You mean Warlords to BfA gold
---
Why would you need to spam the find skills? They're permanent until death.
---
Why not just play on a lower pop eu server?
---
This way you’ll end up on a “dead” realm in the future, due to the time zone.
---
bruh 😂🤣 of all the replies that was my least expected
---
Can you explain what phase 2 is please? Sorry I've not kept up with everything when it comes to classic.
---
Ganking is the spirit of vanilla.
---
## bruh 😂😫😫🔥🔥
---
Ragnaros is the Elemental lord of Fire, he is the final boss in the only real raid Available currently in Classic World of Warcraft.
---
&gt;Can I only find him wow classic?
---
No, he exists both in his Molten core incarnation and a harder Firelands version in Retail.
---
&gt;If I play retail do I miss out on some of the story?
---
&gt;What is cataclysm?
---
Lumping these two, since they're related, the answer is yes, you miss out on stuff, because of Cataclysm, it was an expansion that replaced almost all of the Vanilla/Classic content with newer updated stuff, sometimes with stuff of the same flavor, just with better UI/models, sometimes with entirely new stuff, but it did get rid of a fair amount of the story from before cataclysm, and now you enter a world post-cataclysm, so the timeline's a bit fucky on retail.
---
If they don't want people to be offended maybe they should keep bigoted dehumanizing slurs out of their "humor"
---
It's back up for me.
---
id like to shake his hand!
---
jerk eachother off on a tuesday and call it Saturday?
---
Do you have rage for that?
---
No worries. I just like to engage in topics I find interesting on Reddit - to learn, to gain new perspectives,  or to share knowledge.
---
joke's on you, I'm constantly running out of bag space because *I'm a warlock!*
---
It affects health and mana regeneration in and out of combat.
---
I mean it's a habit already, I'd keep messing up if I changed it.
---
bahnhof here too, restarted router, works now
---
The tank needs to get hit (get damage )to get rage, so if you shield him he does not get rage because the damage is absorbed by the shield. 
---
So heal his damage and in critical moments only use the shield to heal him up full.
---
working
---
This may sound odd, and yes switching to a brand new server would solve my problem, but I'm on Stalagg. I've made friends, people know me. Honestly, it's a pretty good community. The queue's are temporary, at least I hope. I am just stating it's odd to feel forced to play a game all day, or none of the day. I could run it in the background and be afk most of the time, but I don't like that, not when so many people are waiting to play. I'd rather log off for the night and let someone else play if I'm going to hop on Mordhau or something.
---
Have Bahnhof ISP and can confirm. Works through VPN so it's not Blizz.

pretty sure you can still kite King Krush to the crossroads which is equally as hilarious
---
Does anyone have links to it.
---
Eh, everyone helps everyone, am warrior.
---
This stuff is never so cut and dry. As a tank I’ll taunt off people and as a healer I’m keeping everyone alive but prioritizing the tank.
---
Level skinning and layer hop farm devilsaur for endless gold
---
Be patient, that cigarette store is not close by.
---
Yeah I didn't get a fishing pole until I got to SW so I just started fishing to see how it goes.
---
It's really nice seeing a different approach. Most people who play more "hardcore" than casual play on retail wanna play Classic in order to relax a bit more, since you are bound to more weekly activities on retail the harder the (raid) content is you do.
---
Yeah this is something I think we lost with the new engine. You used to be able to show pets in standard party frames, seems to be gone now.
---
What server should I play on? I spent like 3 hours getting into ferelina then chose a high pop server to insta que,  got to 15 now then the server is listed as full I just want a server that isn’t super low pop that’s going to die in like 2 months :( I don’t have time to plan 3 hours in advance to play.
---
HAMSTRING HAMSTRING
---
Ragnaros and the other elemental lords were released by the Old Gods, beings that are counter to the Titans. Titans bring balance to the universes they discover, Old Gods bring discord. When the Old Gods were defeated by the Titans, the Elemental Lords were banished, and Ragnoros was using Blackrock Mountain to try to work his way back into Azeroth.
---
its not that simple as WoW is a part of the blizzard launcher. you cant change it as far as i know
---
Just fear a lot and keep your finger on curse of racklessness to force them out of the fear when moving to other mobs.
---
Better off with hp and spell power

Ty you so much for the detailed answer. This has already given me more of a idea of whats going on
---
Accomplice? Lol you just ask in any chat channel. People are doing it all the time. You don't seem to understand, yet you call bullshit on it? Most effort than benefit for powerlevling? Look at Jokerd level 58-60. Inform yourself, please.
---
But the true question is - how does the elevator work?
---
Remote Desktop on my phone, place myself in the queue while I'm at work and time it so I'm near the front when I get home.
---
I don't play priest at all so i'm not sure but i don't see any problems in taking shadow form (from memory it locks the Holy tree, but you can still cast spells)

Wrong. Its whatever the player wants it to be, not how you want people to play it.

How you cleave as shaman?

I was thinking about how the two games are the same and it got me thinking: what if we could use pieces of you to make a cloned version of the person you were 15 years ago. 
---
Computers are crazy.
---
they're in thunderbluff too, the buildings that lead to the bridges
---
I've got you bro. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTIIMJ9tUc8
---
it's also the male draenei dance in BC.
---
I was doing the sunfish quest in lakeshire, and you bet your ass the warlock who gave me underwater breathing was a hero that day.
---
Buy level 7 (or more) green weapons from AH with maximum 5-6 silvers. Disenchant them and craft lesser wands. Then you can vendor them. In this way you will not lose money. Also, you will have plenty of dust as well, use it to level your enchanting. Craft greens with tailoring, disenchant quest items and greens from drops.
---
And if the priest can't keep up: thank u, next
---
Congrats dude!!!! Must have been very satisfying. :)
---
What's the name of the header bar addon?
---
Wait for it to hit, then FD to drop aggro.
---
They are 2 completely different games, there's no reason to compare them. One is an "arcade" game with time gated content, the others is an MMORPG. End of the story.
---
Same for me. Nobody play shammy?=((
---
None of us CHOOSE how we look, and yet there is a place for each of us in the society.
---
There's also addons and console commands to zoom it out even further if you want a bigger view
---
Pull one at a time in your level range never die
---
If more than one attack one while running away the rest will go back leaving the one you attacked.
---
It's not hard it's time consuming.
---
The main  reason they cleared it so fast is because they could no life the shit out of it, the other reasons being xp exploits. 
---
Stop getting your knickers in a twist because people find something easy which you find difficult.
---
So well done, I’d give gold if I had any
---
I'm not, just looking at your general attitude about stuff. You have mental problems. Please consult.
---
Yup. Having a name of anyone famous fictional or otherwise is grounds for a renaming. Religious names too, deities, etc.
---
Go Shadow and start with Spirit Tap. Respec later if you intend to do Dungeons. You don't need to be Holy to heal lower level dungeons.
---
That could also be said about being comfortable in a guild chat.
---
*All I see is dollar signs*
---
I got spat on :' )
---
Ok buddy, you convinced me... to actually go look at the VoD of him doing it. He had instant invites every time and would end up on the same layer frequently, then leaving the party and getting another invite instantly. That is a bigass-streamer exclusive strategy and thus wholly irrelevant to 99.99% of player and server economy. 
---
Inform yourself, lol.
---
what a gatekeeping weirdo lmao
---
Get a hood item
---
&gt; I understand that some people don't offer much more than their "rotation skillz" to their groups, must suck for their groups eyhh. On a more serious note, I've already mentioned that the dps leaderboards on parsed fights in vanilla have people placing very consistently, regardless of gear. This must mean there are other ways to "differentiate" yourself from other's, so whats the issue? 
---
Yeah I can't be arsed to look this up but without sources that's just words that come out of your mouth with nothing to back them up.  
---
Of course there's way to differentiate yourself from others - for example proper movement - and there's always RNG etc., but if all you character does is press one button then the skill-floor is exactly where the skill-ceiling is, and that's just not healthy game design. Objectively. Maybe some people like it, but I assure you that the vast majority of players probably is not okay with those two things being basically exactly the same.
---
The issue here, btw, is that OP was just - very rightly so - poking fun at the simplicity of Frost Mage DPS in MC and you're going completely nuts over it, generalizing everyone into a very bad stereotype and swearing like there's no tomorrow.
---
And if you're not angry then why is every second word you're using a curse word? Either you're using profanity to give your statements some fake validity or you're angry as fuck. Pick one. In my eyes you look like a toddler who's throwing a tantrum, because someone explained to them that grandpa didn't actually magically conjure a coin from behind their ears.
---
Well, i have no clue what my password is.
---
Classic is tedious time consuming and easy, just as it was 15 years regardless of what you do.
---
Retail has a streamlined approach questing and finding groups is much easier, however mechanically most group content is harder it’s just not noticed when your tank can’t lose threat and your healer can’t oom due to how much they made it appeal to the casual. The casual player is not going past +15 or doing mythic raids so all they see is streamlined content.
---
You can't tap to death, it won't work if you don't have enough HP. Hellfire works, though.
---
Conga rats dude! Get some sleep.
---
Smart thinking, give the queues a chance to go down too.
---
Yeah. That’s exactly what I did yesterday! Using my time wisely before going SFK I was waiting for a group to get there. In the downtime was just running around in cat form getting herbs. I’m now like level 120! Really excited to get high in alchemy. Then I can sell decent pots on the AH for money!
---
It was and as it is with all the pre launch servers, still it was one of the latest.
---
just general mental problems eh
---
Aww, deathwing flying over zones and burninating the countryside was the one part of cata I didn't hate
---
Must be nice!
---
It means it can drop of any mob (around the level of the item) anywhere in the world. Usually the drop rate is very low. Like with these for example. You can kill a million mobs and still don't get them to drop.
---
Lucky
---
I'd say that classic requires a different skillset than retail.
---
The first one is all about preparation and being careful preemptively, but once you're actually doing the content, it is indeed easier.
---
Retail is more about being careful DURING the encounter, while you could say fuck all to preparation and still be fine.
---
It's just different.
---
Stocks don't account for "damage control in a forum". If you actually trade stocks you know what dictates movement, not a bunch of forum threads.
---
Blizzard reported that revenue dropped from 1.62 billion to 1.51 with earnings per share dropping from 0.47 to 0.42. Blizzard stocks were growing throughout the year which you can see and then COD reported no growth YoY when they predicted financial growth by entering the battle royale market, this didn't happen and it was stagnant which lead to the stocks growth stopping and starting to decline, especially as after COD blizzard had nothing new coming out so there was nothing to influence growth.
---
Then at Blizzcon they revealed Diablo mobile and the next trading day we saw the stock drop 7%, again not because of some "damage control in WoW forums".
---
These numbers arn't missing much and WoW players put far too much emphasis into WoW being everything and anything for Blizzard. 
---
Again if you don't trade stocks, I highly recommend you to visit some websites that go into analytical detail around the value of the ATVI stocks and where the decline came from as well as the view on whether they are a short term or long term buy. In literally 0 of the discussions from financial professionals will you find any discussion around what was going on behind the scenes at WoW or as you put "damage control in the forums"  
---
If you look at the Q3  investors pack you will see it references BFA set a new day-one franchise record with 3.4 million units sold through and WoW engagement grew quarter over quarter. then in the Q4 pack it says WoW experienced a expected decline after the post expansion launch. They shareholders knew this was going to happen and wouldn't have been a massive influence in share prices.  
---
TLDR: Blizzard stock was growing throughout the financial year then Blizzard reported a decline in revenue YoY and were going to miss forecast, COD released to the same figures as the year before and then Blizzard announced Diablo mobile which caused a sharp 7% stock decline after huge backlash from fans and media alike.
---
... thats a no from me dawg.
---
Ya, too bad there wasn't a pedometer addon lol.
---
Ah man that is the best of wow right there. Stuff you remember forever
---
What's the letter there (left item)? Can you create written letters as items?
---
How about LoS'ing your healer? I don't see *any* way that could go wrong.
---
If I'm playing with my core group - we'll all make sure the upgrades go to the appropriate person.  I skipped out on so much cloth gear, to get our healer upgraded as much as possible.  Then later comes a point where the healer is saying "No way, you've still got a green in that slot - you take the upgrade" and you all become more powerful together.
---
Now... a PUG? As great as the community is... No, you need if you need, good luck on the rolls.  Try again on the next one if you get unlucky.
---
Indubitably
---
Yeah that part about the chests I have experienced, several times even. 
---
But every time when I trade someone I’m worried that they will scam me. 
---
So far I have only met honest people.
---
I could only get to 80. Has it been patched?
---
Helmet solves all.
---
I wouldnt mind if they added the barbershop from WOTLK
---
First thing I noticed too. I still use mine (well, G11) and it's going strong - although it's a bit worn out, and LEDs started blinking randomly instead of working all the time... as well as my G5 mouse. I hope to use both for as long as they last.
---
I rolled a warrior. I am not a clever man.
---
Slightly in my defense, I was checking my frontpage and not /r/classicwow specifically but still, I get it.
---
Where did you get that strategy from? I taunt mobs off my healer as a Hunter and kite them until the tank picks them up. Its a group effort. You make dps look like motherfuckers who nobody cares about. The tank should learn to generate aggro, the dps should learn to manage their threat, it’s EVERYBODY’s job.
---
Is it normal to lose combo points when switching targets (blank attacks only) or even looting a corpse? I saw a video saying you'd lose your combo if you get points on another mob, like I remembered, but it seems that barely looking away will waste combo.  
---
Also what guides would you suggest regarding odd rep grinding? I want to grind some of them, but I don't know if the TLK guides I used to see will do the trick.
---
3 second gives us a maximum of 2 weapon swings, might wanna try and wait for 2 or 3(boss fights) sunders instead 😊
---
that is great, but you missed the point.
---
Found the 12 year old
---
I don't understand the hate.  Bad players were never tolerated.  And not following the dungeon or raid leader's instructions makes you a bad player.  People that couldn't follow simple cc or kill order were frequently booted in vanilla. I haven't played retail in over ten years so maybe the game no longer requires people follow instructions but originally it did.
---
There’s also the guy with the bear in Desolace!
---
This is man layers deep like that movie contraception
---
I love warlocks who buff me with underwater breathing, even though I don't need it as a druid.
---
It adds flavour to the game! Keep on buffing, guys &amp; gals!
---
*Responsibilities

how do you make bandages?

---
aoe grinding is almost impossible right now.
---
There’s a caveat to your mage example: spell resist. I met a mage back in Vanilla who couldn’t kill the steam elementals in Thousand Needles because he never trained anything but fire spells yet I was a frost mage and had no such trouble.
---
I never played "Vanilla". but did play some BC and a lot of WotLK.
---
Why are Ret Pallies really bad for raids? (I only really played Mage).
---
I am always like “cool, I will kill beasts as I work my way to this point” 5 minutes later I realize I was going the opposite direction after the second mob.
---
Lowly walkers hahaha
---
Not always a foolproof method. I will never ever fucking forget in BC, I was getting corpsecamped by a 70 BE Paladin in Felwood on my mid 50ish Draenei Shaman. So he kills me three or four times, and my best escape plans (rezzing under bridge and hearthing) were all thwarted, so I decided I'd just go do something else.
---
I came back about four hours later and logged back in. **HE WAS STILL THERE**.
---
I AM SORRY BUT 15 YEARS LATER IT'S NOT SPLOILERS ANYMORE
---
That would be the one I was thinking of. Someone else mentioned CC but don't recall a specific scenario where they had a beneficial raid CC.
---
Did you forget a /s or do you actually believe the nonsense you just wrote?
---
# “This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow”
---
Stay away from holy for now.  At lvl 10 being priest you should be a wand bot.   Put 5 points into wands.   You can heal and solo lvl in shadow.   I always respect into holy when I farm for pre raid bis around lvl 55 or when I start doing BRD dungeons.   GL
---
I don't think there's a single dungeon which can't be healed as a shadow
---
There are some guides and builts on youtube, it'll save a lot (and I really mean a lot) if you watch one carefully. Priest can be really enjoyable during the leveling phase
---
I remember being part of 2 full alliance raid groups crashing barrens or orgrimmar
---
That dont have a job or important everyday adult stuff to do daily.
---
Omg retail players ... it is totally no sense to do that on vanilla, especially for RFC
---
Int and spirit will be better while leveling, also to get there whole amount of plus healing I believe you have to use a spell that baseline has a 3.5 second cast, anything less than that will give a reduced amount of healing added
---
Im in the same boat, lvl 20  not a single drop yet in the same zones
---
As a fellow resident of Stalagg, congrats! It amazes me how many people were able to fly through levels, I just hit 16 last night and am having a blast going my own pace. 
---
Now please don’t gank me, I rolled alliance
---
You'll be fine leveling in any spec for healing and soloing. 
---
Shadow is better for pvp and a touch faster soloing but only once you get shadow form. You'd still be fine healing dungeons, but there'll be less room for error and it personally I'd not find it as fun. 
---
If you're interested in holy I recommend just going holy. If you want to make soloing a touch easier then pop some points in improved wand and spirit tap before heading down the Holy tree. That's the build I'm currently playing :-)
---
As long as you avoid respeccing as you go it'll be cheap enough to change to a more raid focused spec once you're lv60
---
I saw lower than vendor price for leather working items!
---
Meanwhile I can't even reach 30.
---
Yeah!  Trained and added to action bar.  I was casting heals that should have hit for the 300s but nothing. Like I said it's like he resisted it or I missed
---
Thank you very much.
---
I'm using it and it's pretty garbage compared to the other ones I've used. It runs all around the world. Completes unnecessary class quests that could be done later. Sends you solo on 5 elite quests in a row and so on. It's a good guide overall but it has shitty parts.
---
If only Germany had an RP server! It was awesome.
---
Yeah it's not the tank's fault, just that 2 high threat swings being below one arrow is kinda lame. At low levels it really doesn't matter since mobs melt anyways, but i wouldn't want that to happen at higher levels.
---
Confirm by who, your mother?
---
After you are done with the lesser wand, you can start to craft greater wand. Buy essence from AH with ~15s and vendor it with 15,35. Or check AH for greater wand prices.
---
I downloaded plater. It’s for unit bars and it displays my debuffs with time remaining on them on the mob. Only drawback is if you’re outside 20 yards you have to rely on the blizzard target frame where you will encounter the same problem you’re already having.
---
While sitting will get you crit, it will not procc enrage unfort.
---
I only switchh to 1h/shield if I am about to die
---
I had moments like that, fast respawns, green drops etc... but some time later I found out I just got lucky for 30min
---
As a frost mage who just did SFK it wasn't fun to realise a lot of things are immune to frost spells :P
---
I've seen that since day one, there were a few camps of troggs in loch modan that near instant respawned. It's the dynamic respawn they decided to use from retail I think
---
ok mr troll thank youuuuuu
---
He would. 3 days is a joke for how broken retail leveling is. Might as well just give free 110 Charakters away.... Ohh wait.
---
How many tries?
---
I guess its about how many players are in the area? Mor green drops just lucky i guess or higher lvl mobs
---
I feel you dude, my mates are all stoned off their tits the whole time we play. We are leveling so slowly.
---
*Mom! Bathroom!*

What, hun?

---
Just to give you a little tipp, if you tame other pets, you'll get more skills for your first pet! It's worth to read a leveling guide, because the pet management is really confusing for a new classic hunter
---
you need to let them tag and hit the mob, once they have done any damage to it, its their mob. You can help kill it and /or heal them and they still get full XP.
---
Well it can only go to 5 mages.
---
It's definitely not 30 minutes but it's pretty generous.
---
If I'd have to guess, I'd say it's around 3-5min.
---
Been using it since launch - it's great. One minor quibble; I can't find a way to display time/FPS/latency anywhere - checked all the settings, can't find it anywhere. Would prefer to see that instead of the coordinates underneath the minimap.
---
Gamers....so oppressed.
---
\#RiseUp
---
5 minutes isn't enough in some cases. Was ganekd by a rogue at the very tippy top of atobwyalon, I spawned at the button. I might never log back in to that character. Faster to just reroll.
---
I won't say they didn't reach it at launch, but the game has to keep them for a year
---
Yeah, lets not try to assert dominance on language, ok?
---
Everyone is right.  Theres like, lots of people out there and lots of languages.  The last place we need another conflict is language.
---
Metric on the other hand...all out war.
---
Should I really throw my life away again?
---
Propably not.
---
Will I still do it.
---
Most certainly.
---
WC and Gnomer are hands down the worst instances in the game
---
Will the hyjal raid be available in classic?
---
You let her play warrior on her first try?... Man that's brutal.
---
It’s funny currently running priest and I just so happened to dps this dung. And another priest was healing and I focus target tank for oh shit moments where the healer needs help (maimed healer for ever) and noticed he was PW:S and I told him he fucks the tank for doing that I’m a nicer way. proceeded to get kicked then re invited after they wiped (priest was the lead) rest raged and restarted because apparently the priest had snapped and blamed every one.
---
I just hit 24 and got execute last night. Feelsgoodman.
---
Literally no one has said that here.
---
Please stop playing healer.
---
I feel sorry for your groups.
---
please tell me about all the similarities, i had no idea
---
I'm level 14
---
Good info
---
dont worry they are acting all high and mighty now but the first time a gold farmer steals their rich thorium vein  they will change thier tune and start playing like everyone else.  the unwritten rule in vanilla is first come first serve when it comes to open world chest and resources. they will learn.
---
I'm kinda doing this as well. While skilling leatherworking I have lots of spare greens in my inventory. While waiting for the airship I inspect people and if I can help and give them any I'll do it for free. Getting /hug's or /bow's is a fair deal.
---
Sodapoppin is probably the most well known feral, one feral I watch is Faramar he is pretty small but answers all feral questions.
---
Name checks out
---
Did this right away. Settings to max, but slide foliage to lowest. The clutter on the ground is only disturbing anyway
---
I detect sarcasm!
---
For the record, I didn't have time to play much last week and my mates got ahead of me...looking to quest with them still not race to 60.
---
for context, they were (aptly) named, onesheep, twosheep, threesheep. foursheep.
---
I’m personally not. I’m just focusing on Retail right now. I only get an hour or two to play per night, late. I can’t waste that time in ques. I’ll play Classic when things normalize. I don’t care about world firsts or anything.
---
I'm pretty sure Blizzard can make those conclusions from play statistics already.
---
And then you would sell a kidney to buy mage weave bandages.
---
My wife kinda did the same thing.  She played WoW in the past and with the talk of classic WoW with our friend and seeing me play, she decided to join.  She is playing a priest as I am a warlock and we quest together and help each other with our professions.
---
The one with the female tauren taking 3 years to walk to the bottom? Definitely the smart move
---
... do we not sunder armour anymore or did you just miss the base threat generator
---
Lmao her choice... she was warned.
---
I hope it won't end in the next 3-4 years
---
How so? You believe 50% of players want BFA more than Classic? Have you been playing Classic?
---
Yes I'm level 40, always full spec Shadow and I've healed all dungeons
---
Counterweights, pulley system.
---
A player with no experience may. Better to be safe than assume.
---
yeah but investors are not told that, if money was on it then they would see
---
To be fair, I think a lot of us have hit the 'unfriendly' status with wife in the past week. My business is seasonal, it's busy all summer, then pretty quiet come September 1st, I've still got lots to do, but I've been taking the afternoons off to play Wow, much to the disgust of the 'unfriendly' faction who finishes work at 5pm each day.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Going to check the settings in my config.wtf as soon as I get home. 
---
What are the odds playing to lvl 20 and never seen a drop of rain?
---
He'll be fine. Probably gets that human +10% rep racial.
---
Are you trying to say if you post on one sub Reddit and you’re banned from it then you’re not allowed to post on Reddit at all? Because as I said (are you a mod?) those are two different subreddits. It’s against Reddit’s policy to ban accounts in a separate sub for behavior in another, so I wanted to know if the mod considered posting *here* with a different account as ban evasion. 
---
I’m not defending this guy I am curious about the policy.
---
That's awesome dude. Glad to hear there's a bunch of couples out there who play. Pretty amazing in my opinion.
---
Not really, that is a multi-boxer
---
Yeah.... Ops
---
I'll keep that in mind next time
---
It's crazy how consistent daggers are compared with staves or 2handers, my shaman is rolling mobs with dagger and shield.
---
It's definitely not the same as vanilla - I think it might be something to do with the layering tech that is in place.
---
I drink after every mob, so yeah ;)
---
demo shout.
---
This is partly the reason.  The other reason is it will also disguise if/when Classic subscriptions drop after launch.
---
Blizzard is riding high after Classic launch but there are already plenty of people burning out on Classic.  Many of those people are checking out retail since they're paying for the subscription.  
---
There are plenty of folks currently trying both games that would drop their retail subscription if it wasn't for Classic.  There are also plenty of folks that would drop Classic if it wasn't for retail.  Keeping Classic and retail linked is the best (probably only) way for them to keep numbers up for both games.
---
As a fan of Classic look at it this way.  Without being tied to retail and a Classic subscription giving both game access the Classic player base in 6 months probably drops 55-80%.  (Retail would also drop too, back around pre-Classic release numbers.)  With retail access granting access to both games Classic numbers maybe only drop 40-60% in six months.  It's good for both games to keep them linked.
---
Had to go through Fenris keep for the quest to deliver the head.  Was a 19 warlock.  There were two guys in there in their low 20’s.  Asked if I could join them, but I guess they thought I was too low level; so they kept dying and I completed my quest without a hitch.  Oh well.  
---
Still need to kill the elite though.
---
But it’s a lot easier with a lower stress job
---
He means added on by  blizz
---
Obviously...then I could pickpocket the kidney back and it's a win win situation for me
---
I swear to god whenever that happens it's one of those anime fights where both are just yelling at each other.
---
And then you notice the gut punch that tore a hole into your stomach. N..na..ni?
---
You have died.
---
Frost, there's not a single real benefit in skilling fire during leveling (it's not even worth skilling it before the opening of AQ40)
---
I always love getting my warlock buffs after I give them fortitude
---
Yes. But it's not that bad once you figure out rotation and dps start to control their agro
---
Won't these be worth loads because of bg capped to level 40?
---
I'm tired of those comparing the two and shitting on each other to feel "their" version is superior (this goes **both sides**).
---
They are 2 different games that cater to 2 different audiences, there's nothing worg in liking one or the other, or even both, I'd just wish people stopped with these stupid comparisons.
---
Combat with adrenalin rush (imp sinister, gauge, get riposte , most of us go sword specialization talent )+ assassin tree for leveling , best slow weapon in main hand and fast in off-hand instant poison on both. 
---
GL &amp; Welcome to the rogue club!
---
For PvP is sub + assassin talent, hemo spec + cold blood combo !!
---
Battle about and demo shout both generate aoe threat. 
---
Battle shout works best when every member of your party gets the buff. 
---
Demo shout is better the more mobs there are.
---
Not a troll, legimitaly worrying about your well being. Must be hard to be 100% useless to society.
---
For rogues, you train for dual wielding at lvl 10 with your class trainer
---
Everyone's asking for a tank.
---
Almost no groups need a healer.
---
you are actually right, there's no such option. there was one back in the days..
---
Oh right, of course.
---
I had wondered this too, so I did some googling and found [this page](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Macro_conditionals). Seems like you can check certain conditionals, but console values doesn't seem to be one of them. Someone please correct me if that's wrong.

you will get a penalty, but it makes up for it by doing speed runs. Like you can stand at the back and loot everything, while your higher level friends storm the instance.
---
I used to do this on a separate account, as it only took a £10 subscription a month....and once it was suitable level, even like 50-55, I used to to run my alts through low level instances, and stuck them on auto-follow. You can clear low level instances in 15-20 mins, and repeat. You'll still pick up good XP, and more importantly good gear for when you are solo questing / leveling.
---
i tanked SFK last night on my lvl 24 warrior with two mages! i would level up more because when there is a huge level difference all of your attacks are gonna miss or have your attacks dodged parry or block and you dont get much rage. only problem i had was when mages AOE it causes chaos lol!
---
Sunder hits one target. Perhaps you haven't noticed in low level dungeons but people are pulling packs and dps are too stupid to focus one mob, so you use your aoes. On a boss, it's perfectly fine to stack sunder.
---
Control + r
---
Multi-boxer
---
Maybe this will be an eye opener for Blizzard and in future retail expansion they'll move away from this instant gratification model they have now.
---
&gt;Pull one at a time in your level range never die
---
And how is that feasible? There will always be respawns, patrols, mobs you don't see, groups etc.
---
YOU are the bad guy here op. Srsly like wtf?!
---
my personal speculation is, they were looking to minimize the number of buttons to make it console friendly in case they started looking for a console port. At the same time as they were increasing items in the in-game shop which was their backup plan in case sub number get lower than a certain threshold to just switch to f2p and bring it to consoles and maybe even mobile.
---
Same reason why they removed rogue poisons, lock picking, pickpocketing, expose armor and so many others.
---
warriors stances.
---
and so so many others.
---
Anything that qualifies as situational or not needed for combat has been removed in favor of a 4-5 button rotation that you use for  2 years.
---
That is one of the reasons i can't play for more than 2-3 months after each expansion launch and end up bailing on guildies and rl friends because i feel like i am playing diablo or PoE more than world of warcraft.
---
stay away from me dude i don't want to know how u know that
---
How do people do it then? All I see is names, no guild tags, even on tooltips when you hover over players. I can only see guilds with /who :|

&lt;Twas But a Scratch&gt; \[A\] | NA-Rattlegore PvP | Raid Times: TBD | Semi-HC |Loot Type: TBD
---
Raid Schedule &amp; Loot Type: Will be determined once we've established our core. 
---
About Us: &lt;Twas But a Scratchl&gt; is a semi-hardcore  guild looking for fun players for the upcoming classic PvE &amp; PvP content. We are currently recruiting anyone who'd like somewhere to level &amp; hang out. The bulk of us are currently lvl 20-30 &amp; we regularly have multiple quest/dungeon groups going at once. We have about 85 members currently, and have typically 15-40 members online during peak times. We also have an active community discord which hosts many games including Retail, P&amp;P, Destiny 2, Leauge of Legends &amp; more.
---
Expectations: While leveling, none. Endgame expectations essentially boil down to: be on time and be prepared. The more experienced core of players will be happy to help any rusty/newer players get up to speed, provided they put in the effort as well. 
---
Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions! PM me here, or hit up our discord: [https://discord.gg/KxcbGVY](https://discord.gg/KxcbGVY)
---
i got a whole lot of hate for writing a post suggesting people manage their threat. lots of people scoffing at me for suggesting we use a tank and such.

Babylon dem thief my herb
---
I, for one, didnt know it matters.
---
How does the game look so crisp? Visual enhancements?
---
I stood up and fucking clapped....
---
You can bind your frostbolt to many buttons.
---
Or you can refocus your effort into things that actually make a difference to your raid.
---
God lord yes. Renew before a pull is a quick way to end up dead from heal aggro. Warriors have basically no way to grab more than one mob at a time.
---
Fkn nailed it

In retail you can tame any beast and it's immediately the same level as you. They don't need to gain exp.
---
you got me mate, again. you're too smart :(
---
This will last a feral untill AQ40. So yeah, I think you've just found your epic mount :)
---
If the tank can't use their abilities like revenge and sunder-armor, because they have no rage, they generate no threat and the mobs will start attacking the damage-dealers.
---
The King is dead... Long live the King!

Use this one:

Hahaha funny you should mention from dinner to bed she kept talking about wow it was great. SO FAR she's not struggling with warrior. But I recommend she stay prot and keep the shield out to increase her survivability and hopefully she'll die less.
---
Bro that wasn't a lawn, that was a glacier
---
What's the point of changing the icon when the game is runing In Fullscreen?
---
Bruh, I have countless list of experience of people doing LFR for the first time without reading any strats or tactics, solely being carried by DBM. Even thou there are mechanics, most people just dont care as they can survive them due to outstanding self heal every class have nowadays.
---
Go AOE build its more fun.
---
Man, this is classic wow. You could probably run it on an iphone 4s
---
Pre-bis feral tank drop, sell it before Phase 2 hits because there is a equivalent item in Dire Maul
---
And majority of the playerbase beyond 30, but sure nitpick it to streamers to fit your agenda. If it was just them they’d do it in a heartbeat.

---
Keep the one who looks cooler
---
Whirlwind axe is extremely strong at level 33. Usually it’s not obtained until higher level due to the level of mobs required to get it
---
See here:
---
&gt; most tank warriors (myself included) will usually just right-click the spell off whenever cast on us, resulting in you having just wasted your precious mana.
---
Let the tank do his job, the dps do theirs, and you as a healer do yours. Your trying to dps as a priest doesn't contribute as much as you might think it does. A tank is constantly spending rage. A tank that cannot generate rage is unable to use his abilities and risks losing threat, since most of his abilities require rage.
---
Not in terms of armour or defense stat.
---
Going quickly through an item list, I think it is BiS until AQ and Naxx
---
Similarish story: I skinned The Beast on UBRS and got The Hide of the Beast. Suddenly everyone was very interested in rolling for it and I just left. It was my spoils from my profession, and I afforded my epic mount through it. Never got any blowback and Im going skinning again this time around.
---
I can relate to this as a grinder. I go out of my way to will any mob with a green or yellow level.
---
Wondering the exact same thing. I like healing and dps as a priest..
---
I had no idea either.
---
Thanks for the quick answers everyone
---
Pretty sure alterac valley is phase 3?
---
y'all think that's bad? Try multiboxing and needing the drops for each character.
---
You don't kneel to pick those up in Classic.
---
happens more on rp-pvp servers
---
I like it where it is now. I can click the WoW tab and be met with classic only.
---
Hey same here its been slow going since the start got in at launch got kicked to queue 4 hours in and been behind since.
---
Still trying to enjoy it as much as possible but seems everyone is getting there quicker. Might have to try these dungeon grind groups but that feels like it defeats the purpose of wow.
---
damn this thing is amazing. would love this on my druid. unfortunately i don't have nearly the gold needed to purchase this
---
Retail bad
---
Classic good
---
I went to game library without having battlenet open, It did not work for me, can you help me figure it out what I did wrong?
---
As far as stats go is agilty only useful for rogues , strength for warrior, int for mage ect like in retail? I’ve seen some str leather drops, agility plate drops...not sure what the point of these stats if the primary wearers of that armor type can’t benefit from it
---
Using numbers from my lvl 33 druid against same-ish level mobs which roughly correspond to yours:
---
Demor Roar: 20 threat
---
Swipe: Roughly 45 threat (have to deduct armour from the damage)
---
Maul: 200-250 threat
---
So let's say we're fighting 5 mobs.
---
Demo Roar: 20 x 5 = 100 threat / 10 rage = 10 threat/rage
---
Swipe: 45 x 3 = 135 threat /15 rage = 9 threat/rage
---
Maul: average of 225/10 = 22,5 threat/rage
---
Demo Roar wins out and Maul is leaps ahead in threat in any situation where you're limited by rage. Against any more than 5 mobs Demo Roar pulls ahead exponentially.
---
Against 4 mobs:
---
Demo Roar: 20 x 4 = 80 /10 rage = 8 threat/rage
---
Swipe: still 9 threat/rage
---
Maul: still 22,5 threat/rage
---
So here Swipe wins out right? In an absolutely ideal situation attacking mobs lower level than us, yes, especially since Swipe can crit. In reality however Swipe requires good positioning and the boost it gets from critting is more than negated by the fact that it can be blocked, dodged, parried and missed, which is especially bad when you're trying to establish aggro at the start of a pull. It gets even worse when you're fighting mobs higher level than you which is often the case in dungeons. Demo Roar can be resisted but that's a much lower chance, and you can get two Demo Roars out before two swipes if you're starting at low rage, meaning you're establishing more threat on all mobs faster when it matters the most.
---
Swipe does outpace Demo Roar significantly against 3-5 targets once you start getting high crit chance and hit gear, but that's not who this guide is aimed at
---
Most importantly, they brought their own friends.  
---
Can't afford that!
---
BiS for feral tanks for a long, long time. 
---
Keep it. Wait a month or two to sell it. You won't get much for it right now, as there simply isn't enough gold in the market atm.
---
Give me a break. Warriors generate only a portion of rage by getting hit and another one by hitting. It's not like they are always on 0 rage. I get it that pressing more buttons is more fun but it's worse if you look at the group performance.
---
Isn't it something to do with weapon swing timing?
---
I have time and it's not too grindy (or even particularly grindy you filthy casual). I bloody like it, that's the whole point of this enterprise and you are not going to roll me back into retail.
---
Very cool, how much time did you spend sitting in queues?
---
Sometimes you just gotta cut your loses.
---
I saw you posting about this on Twitter and was about to DM you this thread 😂
---
Yeah and some of the classes actually have some skills that generate threat ie. shamans earth shock.  Just use it when you want to interrupt not after each CD :) 
---
For tanks, just use marking system from lvl 1 :) I bind ctrl+1 to skull, it made my life way easier!
---
Classic is harder on some things and easier on other things.
---
Well if you want to die just click away the healing but don't blame the healer for being a dick.
---
Elvui.
---
warriors are gear dependant. you got a very good weapon and now you're doing well. makes sense.
---
there are classes that breeze through content the whole way to 60, without caring about weapons whatsoever though. you can solo an elite quest 2 levels above you as a hunter with a shitty green bow you got ten levels ago. that's why people call leveling with a warrior hard.
---
Always leave the least valuable item to crush the hopes of the next person
---
That won't work 40+, so maybe natural selection will get people to remember how dungeons worked in vanilla. As an MT (back then til WoD) - what people want right now out of tanks is absolutely hysterical. No, my 10 second melee range taunt can't hold aggro on 5 mobs you are blizzarding with nonstop crits, it just can't lol.
---
im using Luna Frames and KUI nameplates. Nice and easy to use.
---
nice
---
No secret as to why dual specs were implemented...
---
You'll have to farm gold or pvp in a suboptimal spec.
---
With their mouse and keyboard, presumably.
---
Invite him bro, he might surprise you!
---
WSG/AB are capped to X9 aren't they? Besides those don't seem like particulary good twink boots.
---
Very much so.
---
Honestly i dont understand why people insist on using the voidwalker. Even with talents it wont be able to keep aggro from you unless you let it build it for several second before starting to dot'n'wand. 
---
Improved imp or succebus is where its at. Just go into fel domination if you need that sweet Sacrifice on a whim.
---
i am taking all of this criticism very seriously, and answering as many questions my dear commenters may have. i will take your feedback into account especially when related to age, as that would make me look very young in the future. thank you very much!
---
Hello can I be a panda in wow classic?
---
There are hybrid specs for a lot of classes but generally speaking you won't be as efficient at either, but also won't get stomped so it's really just a question of dedication to one game mode.
---
Yes, but you can learn both goblin and go mosh engineering if you learn to mosh, then relearn engineering and learn goblin just a tip if you plan on trying to unlock everything you can
---
Don't like it, don't play it.
---
Yes, but majority of the game is harder. In Retail you have 95% of experience as easy as possible and then only very specific end-game content being hard. In Classic you have 95% of experience being hard, and only very specific end game content being easier.
---
Trying to tank on my Pally has made me hate mages a little. I'll put a skull on target and hit them first them try to start tabbing through them. About the time my first judgement hits I see the Blizzard hit. Without taunt it's hard pulling one mob off of someone let alone 3-4.
---
You need to increase your weapon skill
---
Could be your particular race, but for a female tauren at least you definitely kneel to loot when the box opens up.
---
Game has been out for a week and people have 5,5 days played. The rest is sleep?
---
It's abused since mop(?) and gets "improved" since then. Just deal with it, it won't change
---
Blue is... Fuck alliance.
---
Bag space is a bitch
---
Default everything else looks ugly to me
---
There may be some that you dont, but all that come to mind do. I just leveled it 1-100 last night and made the goggles and some of the dynamite and they required at least engineering 1
---
The absolute worst for this is priests. Soon as the warrior pulls, this priest in my groups will always mind blast and end up tanking everything.
---
I'm that priest.
---
Roll around in black and white paint
---
So then I shouldn’t pick a class like rogue then? I want to do both all the time. That really sucks.
---
I didn’t realize other warlocks expect to be healed? The thrill of always being one life tap from immediate death is why I rolled warlock
---
""Hah!""
---
Combat doesnt suck it's just not as 1 shot cheesy as assassin. Combat is all about stun lock, open with CS, SS to 4 points, gouge for 5th, KS. Vanish and repeat they should be dead. This is only really doable after you get KS though.
---
Just compare the 2. Retail nameplates begin display at what seems like 2-3x the distance, it's the same distance that markers will display. I've been using Threatplates to target mobs since Cata and it's been kind of a paradigm shift to have to literally click on the mob's body to target it instead of their nameplate. It's minor, but it still changes the way you play.
---
What's wrong with naming and shaming? (though it should have pictures/videos to prove the situation though).
---
There are hybrid specs that hit both goals mildly effective. But most people I know are doing a PVE build and grabbing a PvP talent along the way. For rogues I have a feeling it’s going to get very expensive very fast.
---
If I was a gold farmer I would target rogues. Lol
---
I used to live in the US and played retail there for a few years. I have 10 tokens stored and two months already active, so I'm committed to stay in that region at least for a year.
---
Otherwise I would have switched to EU for the reasons you mention.
---
I'm glad to know I'm not the only one!
---
Cool thanks for the info.
---
 Nice
---
Some chests do not have anything of value to start with. It's not always players who leave back only some melon juce and 3 linen cloth. I had literally spawn a chest with these exact contents in front of my face
---
This is just too much... Let it stay like it is, we got classic, be happy for that.. Now the complaining can stop :D
---
m'lady
---
It depends on your goals really. If you are going to raid for speedrunning and competition, it makes absolutely zero sense to have a Ret pally there to do what Warriors can do way more easily.
---
If you want to have fun though and make it a challenge for your self to be in the middle of the DPS chart (which is about the best you can expect) you can certainly go ret.
---
Also seeing how Apes cleared MC and Onyxia with not even a full raid, half of them dead and not in greens, it is imaginable that some raid groups will not give a fuck what you run as the content is so easy anyway.
---
By the time Naxx roles around you might even be a valued team member.
---
Up to you. I main a mage but also run my own builds and if you are able to stay decently high on the DPS chart and are not being a detriment to your raid I feel it’s fine to have fun, most people won’t notice.
---
Though for Paladin it might be different as setting your role to DPS as Paladin might instantly get you kicked, lol.
---
TL;DR
---
1. This isn't retail.
---
2. Don't be an asshole. Nobody is impressed by your number, it just means you're playing poorly.
---
yeah i felt like this as well. went into the barrens late last night with my hunter and where i normally needed to kill like 30 or so plainstriders to get the 7 beaks i now had to kill 8. also i got the insignia in skull rock after 1 kill and it just seemed i got more quest item drops so far. might also just be very very lucky
---
Questie I believe is the one you are looking for
---
I play druid and that's why I prefer healing myself instead of tanking despite being specced feral for now.
---
It is so triggering that every other priest just has no clue about mana-management and what spells not to use.
---
It's like they use a mix of everything just because they have it and would be much better healers if you would take away everything except of "Heal/Greater Heal".
---
It does suck since there are classes like hunter that have the exact same spec for both pve and pvp. Therefore if I go with a pve spec with a rogue I’d be at a disadvantage.
---
!remind me 1 day
---
i got a shitlist that is steadily building up
---
No one gives a shit about your issues with WoW.
---
Did you give my lowly gnome a drive by "paladin escort" last night?
---
GZ!
---
LOL bruh are you my FBI agent listening to my conversations.
---
Pretty much, just grind the gold and respec... I don’t mean respec every time you do a dungeon or battleground, if you raiding 2-3 times a week or whatever then you can see what days are best and when you’ll *get the most* out of your respec costs.
---
I recommend luna unit frames. Downloaded it yesterday and its awesome! Tons of customization possibilities, you can basiclly customize everything.
---
I know! All the little stats like 1% to hit/crit feel so impactful again. Every single attack matters in vanilla i love it
---
MY DISAPOINTMENT IS IMMEASURABLE AND MY DAY IS RUINED! GOOD DAY SIR 
---
*scoff*
---
Hahahah because you’re horde and it’s comedy supreme to pretend that stuff matters in real life!!! Hahaha!!!
---
me too! i'd never want to risk the swim back to shore.. tbh at menethil it wouldn't be so bad.. but the swim back at auberdine sucks
---
Don't go Ret Paladin, they suck ass in vanilla.
---
Also use PW:S if the tank is cursed with reduced healing (e.g. veil of shadows) and there's no mage or druid in the party to decurse. It's a huge waste of mana to heal through that.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't use Gnomish stuff if you chose Goblin. (I played an engineer in vanilla and never could)
---
Absolutely.
---
Yeah, this seems to be a common thing among Reddit moderators. I’m sure there are a lot of nice people who are mods, but there are certainly some who fit the stereotype of someone who thinks they’re hot stuff because they’re a mod.
---
I wonder how long it’ll be before this post gets deleted :P
---
You set that bar for yourself. You want WF 60? You want to be there with the majority of people? You wanna be the last one to ding 60? You want to level up all your secondary profs before you hit 60? It’s entirely up to you. OP asked whats the best questing addon, you just assumed that OP enjoy the rpg and has the time to read the quest content. If I asked you whats the fastest way to get to that city, you don’t answer back saying “why don’t people use horses?” Cause that is a completely different topic.
---
Wow... my memory has written things differently.. but sure enough 2.0 is when they added summoning.. me and friends must have levled alts and used them.
---
Yup, can’t ever ask for minor software improvements. Seriously OP? How dare you. I like to make all my buttons require a triple click just because that one extra click isn’t that hard, dude. Gobsmacked at these dumbass users.
---
I was racing and then I hit a wall where I can't fucking kill anything.
---
Not if you quickly switch weapons in combat. With high enough apm, you can get benefits of all three! /s
---
You'll then find yourself in violation of false reporting because it's not against the rules to look for a person for a dungeon.
---
It's the spell batching
---
Who says i'm not?
---
It wasn't added until 1.7, so Phase 4. I don't _think_ we have a timetable for phases, but you might be looking at 6+ months at the very least. It could be closer to a year.
---
Absolutely,
---
All ugly people are to report to Undercity where you will be guided safely to your Place.
---
Once we get a date set I'll throw one out just in case, maybe if I give him a best man offer he'll consider it stronger ;)
---
Friend told me she got 10 points out of a single enchant while enchanting my stuff. So maybe enchanting other people's stuff is faster?
---
You aren’t gonna get much fishing done.
---
The fuck you want us to do about it?  Only one trippin seems to be you, btw.
---
&gt; combat sucks in pvp
---
IIRC [Grim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWNt_8xcOZw) played combat in Vanilla, it's not that bad :)
---
why do you care about how others play the game?
---
I personally want the greed greens to vendor. It is a large portion of income towards that mount at lvl 40.
---
Literally why?
---
i have no insight to add, but i will say you should probably grab both skinning and mining at the moment leather both and then drop one for the other proff later. Make some easy money too.
---
Most ppl doing pvp, especially in the first 2 phases before bgs, will be in a pve spec so you’ll be just as at a disadvantage as everyone else which means your actually on an even playing field
---
I did some censuses on some eu eng pvp realms and all of them were slightly horde flavoured.
---
Why is blizzard using someone else’s login screen? 
---
GG blizz.
---
Jesus, some people need to get a life. Why would your partner be bothered about you being able to finish work earlier during your quiet time?
---
enjoy life on the blacklist bro
---
Take boat from Ratchet if you have fp from theremore isle to Ratchet.
---
Yup and to build off this, learning up to date spells for your pet like Bite and the stam/armor skills youll significant increase your survivability and dps
---
Also OP may know this, but on the pet action bar, you can left click on abilities to toggle them on and off by default. When on, the pet will use the spell of cooldown, else it will wait for you to select the ability. Turn growl off in dungeons and only use it on mobs in dungeons when you see your tank about to die. Strategically using your pet is the difference between a good and bad hunter
---
I remember getting the group together to lan Warcraft 3 and star craft all weekend. Good times.
---
I can play from work and i work for a multinational corporation with 37 sites in the UK and EU. Our IT department must just suck or something.
---
The idea is spec agi until you hit the soft cap for crit chance, then move to str. Ideally just aim for gear with both are and agi on it.
---
Welcome to vanilla
---
[  ] Blizzard Art Bar
---
The nights are as dark as they were in Vanilla.
---
Weather is pretty random and some zones are more likely to get it. I play on ultra and have had calm rain in Ashenvale and torrential storms in Wetlands so far.
---
Yep, this seems to be exactly it. Even with the advanced interface options 'ability activate on key down' set. Hmm..
---
I woke up at 6 to snag the Gurubashi Arena trinket and, because of that, I ended up getting into work 20 mins early. Guess who's leaving 20 mins early, too!?
---
I'm in a similar position. I've fallen in love with WoW all over again. Feels great but I also have to be careful not to neglect my real life responsibilities lol.
---
There is no reward for it on retail. Also, I do a million dps, why am I going to slow down my pace to wait and invite others for no reason? Classic forces you into social interactions because of the difficulty, retail doesn't have any difficulty unless your are mythic raiding, and even that's not really hard...
---
Grats!!
---
Imagine being a internet janitor working for free
---
Ah i understand.
---
I knew wwaxe was a beast. But it felt like i was 10 levels ahead.
---
What abilities are you trying to teach him? Make sure that they're abilities cats can learn.
---
is that the same as Zperl? That one is out for classic
---
Fun fact, i believe if you dont release on the boat and let it travel, youll be alive again after the loading screen lol
---
Isn't the in combat thing only for preists and pallys?
---
And I thought I was smart just getting a mouse with 12 buttons on the side that correspond to every option on my hot bar.
---
Grats!
---
Question. If you quested most of the way, how did you minimize the fetch quests?
---
I'm on alliance side and I'll be doing a quest to go to Stormwind then the guy sends me back to Darkshire then the guy in Darkshire is like *Oh yeah. I forgot my mints on the counter. Can you go get them?*
---
-__-
---
No we don't, we need a separate Internet for memes.
---
nothing there
---
Have you ever considered.... that you are the asshole?
---
39
---
No, level up and then come back.
---
That's not possible in classic
---
No,
---
Only Human, Dwarf, Gnome, Night elf, Forsaken, Orc, Troll and Tauren
---
What makes you think that?
---
They should release the expansions eventually, but keep the WoW classic play style. It could run right along side retail.
---
Whats addon name too see prices? I would like to know what to keep or drop when im full.
---
oh okay, i guess everyone else in this thread isn't real, probably part of my mental illness. why don't you pop out another troll comment as the last word and we can settle this as a glorious victory for you
---
Furious howl and scorping poison obv
---
I think engineering is better if you favor PvP, could be wrong though.
---
What ist the best Quest addon at the Moment? I'm tryin to make all Quests even if i outlevel them. So I Just wanna make sure that i dont miss any quest even the ones where you need a random drop to start it.
---
Yeah, I should have done that--Thanks!
---
That's fair. I still think it should be separate or at least have two buttons.
---
This was my favourite comment in this chain lol
---
I'm assuming you read the talent online and not in game. It doesnt read the same. Help yourself here and get off your high horse. Just dont comment if you dont have the answer or anything intelligent to say.
---
Try lortiui it's just gives a darker look to the standard how making it look more evil/ ominicisng
---
In addition to what the other guy said, fishing can net you more gold than you might expect. Being a hunter is advantageous as your pet can keep approaching mobs off your back until you reel in the line.
---
I fail to see how reporting someone for dungeon spam, and reporting someone for spam to get then to stop is any different. I'll take my silence, but I'm not letting this go. People should use the proper channel.
---

---
And even if there wasn't a great example of how to make money off of enthusiasm for previous iterations of the game, telling fans what they want and making them look stupid at a convention shows that that guy values his own idea of what wow should be over what people want it to be.
---
I can go begging for crap if I wanted to. I think it's stupid that other people are trying to dictate how others play a video game. If they want to miss the fun part of the journey that's on the..
---
&gt; If you are having an issue with spammers on your server, dont try to fight fire with fire.
---
Did you really also spammed trade chat with your macro ? If so then thats pretty stupid :D.
---
&gt;  I fully intend to sit in Org, fish, and use my new right click report on every LFG I see in trade. 
---
Thank god one childish player is not enough to get someone muted. You probably got reported by many many players for spamming.
---
Well envy is strong within me!!! Tomorrow i shall take my revenge leaving 3 hours early and having Thursday off!!!! 😝
---
You know how people just call other people faggots?  Whether or not they know if they're gay or straight, they just say it because they're used to calling someone gay as a means of insulting them?  I think that's what op is looking to avoid.  When I was a kid, my friends and I called each other those names to be hurtful. We didn't know any gay people, we just said it because we knew it was bad.  Thankfully, I realized that's not an appropriate way to behave.

“Me flavored water! Come taste my knees!”
---
you don't want frostbite because some will get frozen and not others which screws with your blizzard placement, the only time you want them to be frozen is when you round them up and nova at the beginning
---
if you know Kierstien she's rolled a priest in place of her old rogue!
---
There's not really a "one stat" to go for.
---
Strength on leather is something enhancement Shamans like to see for example, but they're also in for the agility.
---
Yeah, thanks again. Just wish any build could have be violable in PvE at least.
---
Same boat my dude! My S/O is just as hooked as I am. Prior to this the only game she'd touch was LoL.
---
Because it doesn't matter.
---
If it's any consolation the voting probably wouldn't be added for a year or two. We still have to get through all the phases first!
---
Not really.
---
Okay thanks. In that case, do you know a macro that uses the wand as standard auto-attack and not the melee,
---
Because some people wanna play on the classic setting it has. I enjoy switching back and forth to compare zones
---
I was a clicker from vanilla through cata before I quit. Played an unholy DK in WOTLK and was tied with 4-5 other people for top server dps. Also raid led using push to talk through progression for a bunch of server firsts. It's not cumbersome if it's something you've done for years.
---
Those two are almost a complete opposite to level.
---
A warrior has a really rough time fighting against more than 1 mob at a time. You'll die a lot, you'll sit down to eat a lot. You will almost always have an instance group available tho.
---
A priest is so chill to level, sit behind your power word shield, dot the target, wand it down. Heal if needed.
---
It is definitely more enjoyable to level as a priest.
---
i think you may need to learn the definition of "discussion"
---
Wtf thats insane.
---
you haven't been able to exceed the system settings render distance since MOP when they maxed out farclip's high end by default and classic is running on 8.0's "infrastructure" for the most part. 
---
a difference is weather/atmospheric settings, like how in swampy areas at night your view distance is quite a bit lower and your farclip settings don't change that. 
---
i think this is all your'e experiencing. your console command isn't working becuase it's already at the max if you have it turned up in your settings (view distance)
---
Oh, they did the math did they?
---
Well, you wanna know what happens when a tank has PW:S and has no rage? He's only doing white damage. What are you going to do at that point? Use your wand? Cast Mind Blast (lol)? Oh thank god for that, eh? The priest is adding to the damage!
---
Guess what can happen when a tank has rage gen? He can cast things like rend, heroic strike, revenge, sunder armor (increasing melee dmg), overpower, etc.. Believe me, your "dps" isn't necessary. Stop relying on bullshit excuses for being bad at your class.
---
now this post has testosterone
---
Try stabling and unstabling
---
I want them to add to the base world but in the same style, I think a voting system would work.
---
Hey to a mage I’m a tank!
---
As a tank I literally take one mage for poly + water or a lock for summons. The next 2 dps slots I take whoever asks! Ret pally, Druid doesn’t matter! Iv always hated that everyone discriminates to save a little bit of time. People shouldn’t be left out just because they are playing what they enjoy #breakthemeta 🤘
---
This is a screenshot from classic so you definitely do, though most of the time when picking things up you just kind of stand there. Must just be a small animation at the end
---
Cool idea, but the odds are overwhelmingly likely that you will not be impacting me or those "like me." But you can go on being an indiscriminate dick if you want.
---
Saw this same mod remove another popular post that I thought was pretty good. Silly boy.
---
What does you having to be a submissive child have to do with this discussion? I don't care that you think I'm superior to you, I was using your words and stating why they are irrelevant to the discussion.
---
I'm not trying to win, you just have yet to refute a single point I made.
---
It's perfectly viable if you're fine with being limited to dungeons. Not being concerned with crushing blows makes it perfectly viable to stack up on spellpower and stam as your primary stats, with intellect and strength as secondaries, while tossing out defence.
---
I'm on an odd timezone so the odds are I'll never raid anyhow, but just in case I'm running a dual spec and will acquire two gearsets so I can tank dungeons and heal raids in the event that I'm picked up by the odd pug.
---
And Classic raiding has already been shown to not be so tough that absolute minmaxing is mandated, so I think it'll be just fine.
---
I saw you walk past with a Stiches on your tail in Elwynn and just said "lol".
---
This is literally me
---
Grats
---
I’m on holiday for a week and all I can think of is playing classic hurry up weekend!
---
Using dots and vand with imp vw and he still cant hold aggro, went drain tank with suc/felhunter (pvp) and i find it much more reliable
---
They are not even elite, but I wouldn't dare to push alone in the room. I had to finish the quest just by killing and waiting respawn of the outside mobs. My hunter was 23 when I did the quest and it wasn't so easy. I rerolled to mage and soon will be there again, I bet it will be hell with mage I'll have to be at leary 25.
---
I’m guessing R stands for racing in RPG.
---
Then when you get  healer who doesn't wand or renew...
---
if the enemies level are gray to you will get no levels (same with quests that are gray)  
---
but if you're looking to help ur buddies catch up to you, it works out cuz they'll get exp while u don't
---
And then it still takes them 18 days?!
---
I changed my font to Myriad Pro Bold. If you want to do this, get a font that you like, go to the World of Warcraft &gt; Classic folder, and make a new folder there called Fonts. Then copy the font you want to use inside that folder 4 times. Name them like this: ARIALN, MORPHEUS, skurri, FRIZQT__. The font has to be .ttf extension.
---
You decided to combat spamming by being an obnoxious spammer. Excellent.
---
I'm a level 11 tauren druid on Ten storms, let me know if you guys for a disc, I'd be up for joining!
---
Probably because of the level required? Like as a general rule, most of the population isn’t in the level range at this time. 
---
Other factors might be you’re zone, local and game time. H or A ? And so on
---
Yeah thought about another realm for ally.
---
Oh dang the real classic experience wanting to play ally and getting wiped by a horde warband  lol ty
---
Market prices are going to depend heavily on your server
---
It's a purple from when purples meant they were purple. Of course you can flip it.
---
This is exactly me
---
Thats propably true. Quick question while you are here.
---
Can tauren shaman get double handed axes, and if can, how? Cant see anything in weapons trainer. Is It a talent thing?
---
Question: Ive been healing Deadmines 5mans while also being able to off dps in cat form. Now I know the cost of swapping is massive in classic compared to BFA so Cat-DPS is hamstrung a bit. The idea is "never shift unless I will spend enough time in cat to regen the shift cost" as of now, but is there a viable "Catweaving" spec in classic where you still have enough heals to get thru 5mans but also go maul something when you can? Im sure in raids its not viable at all, but for those guild group runs and leveling dungeons -- is it possible?
---
I mean, it was a long time ago you cant expect me to remember everything.
---
Yeah make a group. Spam every few minutes
---
but my point is not that those things dont reduce communication, but having no communication except for /lfm or lfg" is not really communication, because it is just a more tedious way of group finders purpose.
---
I don't really know honestly. Never played Horde in vanilla, so I don't know most of the quests.
---
BUT MAH DPS METERS
---
I've been in the same position myself in a different game, sacrificing important IRL things (relations, work, sleep, increasing stress) to rush the endgame/front of the line in terms of progress asap. Not worth it.
---
So if I can inform someone speeding through the game, not because they like to rush but because of psychological pressure of their friends or guild being ahead to re-evaluate their stance and enjoy the relaunch of a game we used to play 15 years ago instead, I'm happy.
---
But every man for himself. ;) You do you.
---
&gt;if you wanted to say Dire Maul
---
But nobody ever wanted to say Dire Maul.  It was almost impossible to ever find groups for that place.
---
Tanking is much easier in retail though.
---
If someone starts quick dps in classic it is incredibly hard for tanks to regain that agro.
---
Yeah, I tried to convince them but they wouldn’t budge.￼
---
This. Also I mostly tab through all mobs and hit them once + thunder armor. You have to be quick so you don't lose your main target.
---
This is viable at 3 mobs - 4 mobs is a challenge but doable.
---
Above that your aoe classes can only pray.
---
Noope.
---
Axe.  WW axe is just too good.  You can change at 60.
---
Cheers for the stats.  Worth picking up booming voice to increase the range of BS?
---
Its THE best in slot
---
To each their own. All I was saying is that some people might find that gameplay boring. If you like it then that’s fine, was just trying to explain why one might not.
---
i’m trying to lower it not maximize it
---
Dear Rogues,
---
Feint, feint, feint, feint
---
The best part is: I now have an excuse not
---
To visit anyone abroad this yeas. Sorry mate, ran out of holidays.
---
I'm uncertain, never played horde until now and I can't remember how weapon skills worked :(
---
Maybe someone else will know the answer!
---
There was a brief time when BGs capped at level 30 instead of 29.  I got my alt warrior to 30 and had a friend help me with the quest.  
---
The result was lots of destruction!  It got boring quick though.  And then they switched the brackets.
---
I absolutely love how everyone is getting back into the "teenage me" mode due to this game. And I am no exception :D.
---
Fair. But nah it could be a shit run depending on the group. So many trash mobs that easily get pulled and wipe groups. The layout wasn’t as well known as it is these days and etc
---
Hey man, you do you!
---
I started during BC... it was never uncommon to see people using Trade Chat for... well, anything. If a lot of people are using a channel for those purposes, then people are inevitably going to look there for that type of information. I think there's a better way for you to appeal this without risking your own mental health. I know that you may find your behavior normal here, and you do have genuine reservations - but IMO you're acting out unreasonably, it does you a disservice, and it makes you look neurotic as hell to others. I encourage you to relax a little.
---
Classic isn't hard.
---
I don't know what server you are on, but turn on the LookingForGroup global channel and try in there. My server also has a LFG channel that is player made, so see if there's one on your server. Either way, posting every half hour is waaaaay too slow. Try every like 2-5 minutes (based on chat speed) for better results.
---
You can compare Retail to Diablo 3. 
---
You can't compare it with Classic. 
---
Even if you could, the mechanics are only a tiny little thing in the whole picture. 
---
Besides, who even cares about difficulty? It's the immersion what we're here for, and we're getting it. And it feels great. 
---
Welcome home.
---
Ok thanks anyways :D would really love to wield a huge axe.
---
You deserve that ship
---
VC on Haomarush
---
this can be tough because you will switch which weapon you get a lot as you level up, it might be worthwhile not put your points into those at all yet until you get to level 60 and get a good weapon you will keep for a long time
---
you're aware that there is no payment for max lvling your character in vanilla, right? also that over the years blizzard was banning arena boosting for example while now it is considered "coaching" and allowed?
---
Just buy one. It's worth it.
---
Happend to me in WC. Me as a feral druid and our rogue lost to the dps warrior (he asked if I could tank since they could get a friend to heal.
---
He got 3 things and needed the legs....
---
Im sure a guildie would just make you one if you asked.
---
no more waking up and playing before the queue begins...
---
1k armor in bear form. Op as fuck
---
Rolling a paladin. How much pain am I in for?
---
Since you have enchanting just make one. Its a really low level recipe.
---
Congrats dude!
---
You can do dagger build or hemo both are good fun for PvP hemo is more popular tho.
---
Hi, /u/MischaFoo
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cz3xli/what_class_would_make_levelling_best_in_a_duo/). 
---
from 13+ you'll get a few options from quests but if you're a priest, a wand is your most important piece of gear so i'd make one (or just buy one, people have them for sell for like 3s if you ask in trade/LFG)
---
if you're not a priest then a wand is mostly a stat stick so i'd just grab whatever you see from a quest next
---
You can be just as immersive in retail as you can in classic, I just recently leveled alts without heirloom gear doing nothing but quests.
---
[](._.)o=|==&gt; you didn't just say that
---
Played resto shaman in vanilla and again now. Trust me. Your talent Respec cost will cap at 55? J think, get use to using that on respects each week
---
I suggest you understand the rules of this subreddit, and what is considered a low effort meme.
---
**Low Effort Memes: Low effort memes are defined as memes that would not clearly be related to Classic World of Warcraft if text overlay or overlaid game logos/game elements were removed from the image. Most advice animal memes and label memes are considered to be low effort memes.**
---
Furthermore, if you have a question about a moderated action send a mature mod mail, instead of a direct message to me calling me names. Super mature, btw.
---
So you want some math?
---
Shield Rank 10, 500 Mana, 942 Absorb, instant but 1.5 Sec GCD
---
That is a HPM of 1.9 and a HPS of 628.
---
Greater Heal Rank 4, 655 Mana, 1903 Healing, 2.5 Sec Cast (with heal-spec)
---
That is a HPM of 2.9 and a HPS of 761.
---
Also Greater Heal pulls ahead even more with bonus-heal since it's  coefficient is 83% while PW:S has only 10%.
---
PW:S is a situational spell and I see no way how a healer who is concerned about playing as efficiently as possible would think that it is great to use outside of the niche-situations it is meant for.
---
How did you phrase your complaint?
---
I mean these mods probably signed up for it when this reddit was like 20k People. Now it is far bigger.
---
I could imagine them not having time to answer every Little complaint when it is passive agressive on a post they have removed the third time because it was a repost or a low effort meme.
---
Since I don't have any Information on what your post was and how you complained it is fairly hard to judge the mod on that.
---
Why would you try to spark fire with the mods anyway? Can't you just put some more effort into it and repost?
---
The trolls are as low as 33 and you can just buy the bindings on the AH, they were pretty cheap on my server. As low as 10s. Just need help with the 40 elite at the end of the chain, which I was able to do at 32 with a 30 Priest and 35 Lock. It’s actually pretty easy to get in the early 30s.
---
&gt; Turn the quest in and the followup is to collect fucking murloc fins.
---
OH GOD DAMMIT i'm about to run back over there again. thankfully the respawn rates on those particular murlocs are almost instant. The gnolls (brutes/mystics) not so much
---
&gt; go up to westfall 
---
Or you know, Darkshire.
---
Cya.
---
Honestly the feeling you'll get will depend a lot on the area. The night in Deadwind Pass will probably be much more darker than in the barrens and you'll have more rain in stranglehorn than in durotar.
---
I it's counts for *you* too. If *you* need, then need. I don't do it greedily so maybe that's why it works, I greed everything except what would actuslly be an improvement to my current loadout.
---
I think it would only be implemented after the last phase, but then again I extremely doubt it. WoW has a much worse elitist problem than RS does, and the community wouldn't vote for anything. I personally really wouldn't mind, nor care since its an older version, and content I've cleared already. Vanilla was fun, has some great RPG elements, but ultimately has flaws that limit some classes greatly to the point there's no reason havong some talent trees, which everyone knows is true. 
---
At least Jagex and the RS community took ownership in the lack of content 2007 RS had, and sought to improve it based upon community recommendation. Something which the WoW community could never pull off. This could be a turning point in revitalizing and taking the game into a different direction with different xpacs. But rose colored glasses and nostalgia will never allow it to happen.
---
Just bind all the abilities to voice recognition so you have to yell -"FIREBALL"
---
Wow dude you're actually using add-ons? I bet you also use classiclfg. You're screwing yourself out an authentic classic experience. Quite pathetic. You will never hold up to my standards.
---
Are you using vpn or any app? Check in task manger if you’re not sure. And try using a LAN cable if you can.
---
I believe it is right click, left click will tell the pet to use that skill.
---
Can I change the colour of my mana? It doesn’t show up well on my screen.
---
I’m 39, and still hang out with the guys from high school.  We all stood up in everyone’s weddings, some of us are godparents of our kids.  We get together maybe 1-2 Saturday’s a month on average, not counting special events.  
---
Things change, priorities shift.  We start families, we focus on our significant others and children, maybe work as well.   It’s not going to be the same, but it doesn’t have to end your friendships, as long as both you and them and OK with it not being the same.
---
Currently 32 warlock.
---
NA Mankrik server.
---
Looking for guild who expects to be raiding around week 3/4/5. Looking for a guild that is going to do progression raiding.
---
Weekend availability saturdays only.  Mon- friday 8-11 pm.  Also looking to level atleast 2 other toons who i would enjoy raiding with. Mage and warrior will be my next 2 characters.
---
Tailoring / enchanting are my TS. I hope to have crusader enchant by the time i hit 60.
---
About me: ive been playing wow on and off since vanilla beta. Did not play legion or BFA.  
---
Favorite instance in vanilla: Strath.
---
Favorite raid in vanilla: MC.
---
I have every collectors edition except classic collectors (yes i have vanilla).  
---
Used to be on Mannoroth in the guild Exitus / 12 Prophets (during bc).  Ive raided in MC as a main tank and a DPS.  I raided every original raid. BWL MC NAX AQ40 Etc.
---
Pm me in game or DM here. Am in a placeholder guild for now.  Would also like to connect with individuals to spam dungeons with until 60 and for pre-raid gear.
---
My wife and I are a level 16 Prot Warrior and Holy Priest Combo.
---
We are at the point where we can pull in full Kobold Camps in Redridge and full clear without dying.
---
We spent days (felt like years!) getting over the hump in Westfall.  We are in no rush and loving every minute of it. 
---
Can't wait for that Duskwood Atmosphere in our future!
---
What the hell is the matter with you people?
---
Are you stupid, Verificus :D ?
---
Oh right.  Thanks
---
Pain? Lots. Deaths? None.
---
If you need, need. Want it for money, greed. I do not recall any such "one need per run" rule. If you really want to be polite you could say that you're going to need on it as it's an upgrade.
---
Game feels laggy even with it. Spell batching, melee leeway, etc.
---
Then it's gonna be rolled between the 3 of them. What's more fair than rolling for it?
---
Yes, i cannot math
---
3/200 isn't that bad though?
---
Yea im playing alone but i was doing dungeons with strangers i added them to friend but they doesnt seem to formna guild or something
---
And people complained that BFA rotations went down to 4 buttons
---
You're forgetting brain dead individuals have done that for years now. They'll never stop gatekeeping what is considered "their" WoW.
---
Here's someone who actually knows priest.
---
Being passive aggressive won't help your case
---
I can't recall the source, or if there even is one, but I recall someone saying that void elvea number around 20 in the lore.
---
Its actually in the general tab with your racials and stuff
---
I feel that.  What’s the add on you have running across the top of your screen?
---
You and everyone else
---
And the temperature. Holy fuck, the humidity.
---
It defaults to 100. Mine was the same on a 60hz screen.
---
Im talking about world content( questing ) never mentioned dungeons or raids . Also, bring 40 man raiding to retail : 40 gangstas downing mythic Aszhara ? That’s worthy of a sub
---
if there's one thing retail does well is creating challenging pve, most people won't be able to clear mythic and even heroic at times without a carry
---
I enjoy both, but interesting mechanics are good for every game period. Just because you enjoy a thing it doesn't make it immune to criticism
---
Glassburken if you didn’t know means ”Ice cream jar” in swedish.
---
Sharding is like small areas. That's why you could be walking next to somebody and see them just phase out, or see people phase in when they cross the border to an area. Layering is apparently a serverwide or continent-wide thing and the only way to swap to a new layer is to join a group that's in a different layer.
---
How
---
Or pass when you're full inventory, or expect a quest item and you don't want random things to fill the spot.
---
To look cool while doing it
---
On the flip side you have level 15 horde in the barrens running into lvl35+ alliance coming from STV and Dustwallow
---
&gt;it was generally understood that you only got one Need roll per dungeon run
---
It’s not for solo playing the whole time. Mate mates. Enjoy the ride. It’s more of a time filler than a hardcore game that you can Just jump in an out of. Well in my opinion. 
---
Wow isn’t a game. Wow is wow
---
Is anyone else having a hard time sticking to a class? I have a 25 mage And a 22 hunter... A level 7 priest and I just don't know what to do.
---
My boss: https://www.wowhead.com/quest=11055/the-booterang-a-cure-for-the-common-worthless-peon
---
If you need hit need, if not greed.
---
Easy
---
Lmao I thought the same thing reading this thread dude. Someone was like 3/200 that's sooooo rare and I'm sitting here 14k KC dry on my DWH
---
Can't put the issue of class design aside, unfortunately. It's the lens in which you see the game through.
---
The part about me knowing deep down that it’s wrong? What are you talking about... you need to change your perception, it’s like me paying YOU to buy your characters gold, I get what I want and you get what I want and we’re both happy. The hell are you talking about.
---
I'm priest and my main damage ability has double aggro slapped on it for god knows what reason. Blame blizzard not me.
---
Just kidding, I'm healing anyway.
---
There is not much that can be done outside of leveling up a bit, however a few thing's I do when I notice I am having troubles in a group with agro are;
---
First, say something prior to getting into the dungeon like "Hey guys, Im a bit lower level than the average mob here. Can you give me a couple seconds to grab aggro please. It may take a few more seconds to kill stuff but we will have a smoother run because of it :)"
---
Another thing is download some form of marker add on or use Blizzard's default setup. (I am at the office right now, but can update this post when I get home with the one I use). Mark your current target with a skull, and tell everyone that the mob is priority. In packs of mobs as long as the DPS follow's your mark you will be able to; Run in, Demo/Battle shout, 1-3 sunder's on Skull, then Tab around tossing out a sunder and a few swing's on each mob to hold the aggro your shout generated.  When the skull is at about 15% HP, move it to the next target, rinse repeat :)
---
Happy for you! 
---
Wish my gf played, would've been fun.
---
to be fair, i didn't stop to consider retailers reading this sub. you're right though, poor choice of words

I know some perform the same functions as others. But...'eh'.
---
((If MoveAnything gets ported to Classic, I'll just use that to move the UnitFrames, if not...I'll keep a eye out for an addon.))
---
If it's the gold you were gonna use for a mount I wouldn't. If not, it may be a worthwhile investment. But you would have to wait until phase 3 like you said.
---
As a long time tank if you are impatient I will simply stop and you can find patience or leave.
---
No. Chat says its vUI so Id bet my gold on that..
---
Thanks! Do you know where it starts?
---
I am more annoyed by the missing animation when opening/looting things like chests or nodes.
---
And you still bother to answer...man i could write alot of shit about alys killing me in groups, you weaklings usually leveling 3-4-5 people together and just kos lonely players on sight, im still got my revenge 1by1, but then again, more alliance to come. And im giving you props for that! Horde like always regret to gather a group to beat allys. Kinda hard for lonely shaman to pewpew vs large groups
---
Because no one gives a shit? Maybe? Idk.
---
Sure, some people got to level 60 a couple days early because of it and cleared some endgame content everyone knows inside out already. 
---
This is part of some challenges that top level players use to compete amongst each other to see who can come up with the strats first. It affects nothing about your game. Enjoy it. Classic WoW release was NEVER about a 2 week race to endgame content, but a way back to a good persistent game supported by devs who care again.
---
Knowing blizzard, they have become a shit company, but they always supported their games for a very long time. I mean, there are still ladder resets for Diablo 2 and balance patches for Warcraft III happening.
---
Oh cool, Yeh I got pretty bored leveling, to me it’s all about gearing up for phase 2 when battlegrounds are released I enjoy
---
Pvp.. do you like pvp?
---
Jesus, my fucking eyes. What is this photo nonsense?
---
I dont believe there is any way to change the default right click interaction from auto-attack to shoot. thats kind of built into the game.
---
just have to stick with keybinding your shoot im afraid.
---
Happy for you OP, may RNGesus bless thee with all the loots, you and your girl! Happy questing!
---
Which one is [Jim?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eDG26vCoQu4/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
MFW I'm on non full French server and don't know what a queue is.
---
Can you lose it? Will it always follow you?
---
just did that quest.  Thing needs a hobbit's journey warning.
---
same on my shaman who was retired after ulduar
---
That stat really isn't something to be looking at while leveling.
---
+healing is especially usefull if you're a high level with good gear, casting low rank spells.
---
Considering I never have it off classic now that Warcraft tab is classic for me
---
Just watch nixxiom
---
Remote access, controlling the pc via my phone
---
Yeah and also after typing comment I realized that you cannot actually compare maul versus swipe/roar directly.
---
In a realistic scenario you would do auto attack AND swipe/roar or maul AND swipe/roar.
---
In a scenario where you cannot use swipe/roar because of rage issues, auto attacking + roar/swipe would always come out ahead of only maul.
---
Thanks! The barrens are literally lit up
---
PvP server - Engineer, without a doubt. Nets, goggles, bombs etc
---
PvE - you’re dead to me and I have no solutions for you.
---
24 rogue, 19 warrior and 22 paladin here.
---
I'm thinking of rerolling the paladin to dwarf.
---
was it 80 gold or 800 gold ?
---
Or just tag with random people , questing is wayyy more fun w people ( and faster)
---
You are right!
---
Yeah my priest is 35, for someone who never played classic(started in BC) I’m pretty pleased with myself right now. Once I get a mount at 49 I’m gonna spend time on cooking/fishing.
---
😎
---
don't brag and show this to all those 21 people that doesn't know it by now :(
---
Congrats! Did you level as elemental for all 60 levels, or did you switch from enhance at level 40? Is it easy to level as elemental? I personally want to make a shaman as my alt since I main it on retail since BC.
---
great video to wake up to.
---
Back in  the original wow. I used to raid (Mc, ony, bwl,zg) with an insane dps lock who did not give any shits about aggro. 
---
So as a paladin we used to be on DPS meter watch and we would BOP him if he got too close to the tanks aggro. 
---
It pissed him off. But he slowly learned to take a breath between casts. 
---
His excuse was I can always self res if needed.
---
Yeah on pvp servers hordes are always more (and on pve the opposite).
---
I don't mind the lifetaps. Its fine. It pisses me off when i put a renew on you and you're at full hp. Then lifetap when the renew is finished.
---
better than warriors. we just charge the nearest thing in that direction and kite it while running to our destination.
---
You can easily go 4/5 especially in the late game.
---
Just tell people your face got smooshed in by a tauren hoof.
---
disappointed but thanks
---
What server? Lol
---
Did you even search the subreddit? Were you even here the day it happened? All anyone can QQ about is "layering exploits." From the defenders saying he only did layer exploit from 58-60 due to pvp ganking, to the long term ramifications of layer abuse, to how Blizz isn't going to leave it in permanently.
---
The discussions have been had, will continue to be had, and can be found if you search "layering" on any community site with a search function.
---
It’s whoever rolled first.
---
Hunters don't swap weapons (normally), you can have melee and ranged equipped at the same time.
---
Just plan ahead so you’re not afk and it’s all good!

---
..if you can afford it
---
I don't need to make a comment, u/HaAdam1 explained it pretty nicely
---
On enjoy the ride? Hah
---
&gt; since your healer is probably casting downranked spells and has a ton of mana to spare.
---
I mean if they're not, that's a bigger problem than anything else you've mentioned so far.
---
The biggest shame is his core fans give zero fucks and remain loyal in a way that reminds me of a certain business man turned politician. Ironic considering both are likely fan milking narcissists. I think he was the one that encouraged the DDoSing and harassment of Panser from the Facebook channel Trade Chat but I'm not positive on that.
---
I can't speak for others but I run dungeons as a druid and I try my best to be fair. If I'm a healer and if cloth gear drops, only if it's a decent upgrade, I'm rolling Need regardless of how many times I've "won". If it is something borderline, I'll ask the group's permission. If I've gotten gear twice already I probably won't roll unless it is specifically useful for my class + spec. Regardless of my own feelings, need/greed rules need to be set at the beginning by the party leader. You can't help what drops .. so if you get all the loot.. it's not your fault. You can avoid any controversy by being "Master Looter" even if other people abuse it. I'd suppose that a good portion of people in dungeons don't have that sort of coordination you speak of.  
---
So far my experience has been people "Need" on any gear that they think is an upgrade. I've had Pallies roll on Agility Leather gear, Mages roll on a Spirit staffs, etc.  Either adapt that mindset and "get yours" or expect it so it isn't a surprise when it happens. 
---
If you aren't party leader, communicate before hand and get the rules or if you are the party leader set them and make sure everyone knows what they are. Main spec before off-spec is still a thing though. So no one should be rolling for an off spec unless they ask beforehand.. I.E. R-druid rolling on Feral gear.
---
P.S. Hunters, don't pull threat at range then FD immediately, the mob near you is also probably near the priest/mage and will go for them next if you drop all your threat. Bring them back to the tank first!
---
Level 2 rogues!
---
You do realize that unless you play retail, it has it's own dedicated tab. I just click WoW and play and bam I'm on Classic because I don't touch that dogshit of a game called Retail.
---
Every class has a base bonus from stats, these are:
---
Strength: 1 extra melee attack power for melee
---
Agility: Bonus melee/ranged crit and dodge chance
---
Intelligence: Bonus spell crit and extra mana
---
Stamina: bonus health
---
Spirit: bonus mana / health regeneration
---
Some classes gain a bit more from stats.  
---
Rogues get 2 attack power per agility, but also still get 1 from strength.  
---
For all the details check this page: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview
---
Nah
---
Ya and it’s own subscription too right !!! 🙄 stfu
---
Who knows anymore, had a hunter roll on robes of aragul over mage and priest and I was quite surprised. If you need something need it I guess but game seems to have a lot of ninjas to be fair. Always comments in trade chat about loot drama
---
I'm with this guy, I love the look of the default UI.

---
Thank you! And ask me in the future who got to 60 first and I won't even remember their name. Just that there was some controversy about how they did it.
---
Let's just enjoy the game and not let how someone else plays affect us.
---
This happens in retail all the time. Haven't yet encoutered it in classic, but the day will come.
---
To start, I use the following for my general spell rotation:
---
/Petattack
---
/Castsequence immolate, curse of agony, corruption 
---
I wish I could check to see if a target resisted my previous spell so I could recast, but I'm pretty sure I can't.
---
I had a party full of warlocks
---
IN MY OPINION: Retail would be perfect if : they had kept talent trees , wotlk glyph and enchants system , make the mobs stronger to lowkey force players to band together , make rewards meaningful again , plus as said before 40 man raiding .
---

Here is lovely old screenshot from vanilla...
---
Shamans were pink.
---
Do enh to 40-45 then respec to ele. It's way better in the endgame.
---
I think creating a division between "classic" players and "retail" players is detrimental and adds toxicity to the community. We're all WoW players.
---
Just saying "retailer" makes me cringe. 
---
Where did this come from? This division that's propped up seems so ludicrously silly to me.
---
There is no such thing as classic player and retail players. Just people that play wow. Cut the shit

---
Yep. I'm still only 19 but all 5 professions are nearly at max and I've spent a lot of time on the AH on my banker and I have two alts at 7 and 5 to level their professions.
---
I generally tend to pass on contested stuff after I already did win something. If it's a super big upgrade or something which is only for the role I currently fill in the group, like a shield when I'm tanking, I will of course roll need.
---
I stopped restricting myself to roll need based on armor classes. Pre-Raid BIS gear for DD warriors has many leather items (noteably: Dal Rend eyepatch), and I _am_ going to roll for these items, no matter how angry the rogues will get.
---
try teamviewer
---
There is a plan and they've already tried it(retail). Now let people enjoy classic and play whatever you like.
---
you have more friends irl than i do in general lol
---
Agi also gives crit armour and dodge tho
---
Id rather have that problem than herbalism where nodes are spread thin, its dangerous to herb low level and nodes can be taken up by high level herbs
---
Your server will be raiding the other sides capitals very soon. An alliance raid through the back entrance of Undercity is always good for a laugh
---
Try a server from your region and see if you still get disconnected, if you dont that's your problem.
---
Mark skull as 1 target, tank builds threat on every other mob in group while dps will kill the skull in few sec..easy.
---
While most tanks mark skull then try to tank skull while healer is pulling aggro via healing from other mobs which tank is not tanking cause hes struggling to keep aggro on soon to be dead skull.  
---
And proper tanks will switch target every few sec so " attack tanks target" is worst advice possible.  
---
Use marks and use them properly.

I actually enjoy the zones. I want to experience wow zones like an adventure. A story told through landmarks and events. A young tauren naive to the world slew his first plain strider in Mulgor, leaving the other calves i learnt the way of the beasts and tamed my first friend. A pick plainstrider, Auralian. Through regretting the name we ventured out into the waste lands that are the barrens. Carfull not to stray from the path we reached a bustling crossroads.  
---
Resources were low, so Auralian an i were forced into work. That work took us to the village port of Rachet where we teamed up with some fellows and brought down the guns of Northwatch. 
---
Unfortunatly for Auralian he was stabled and a new pet joined the group. A white lion called cat due to lack of naming commitments.
---
We slew the centaur leaders, killed the harpy wench, mauled mankirks wife and stole some silver. Work dried up and we looked westward towards stone talon mountains. 
---
Mages: 
---
Frost nova, blizzard, cone of cold: repeat untill sm. Do some more.
---
is there a loottable i can see for world drops?
---
Slow down and enjoy the game
---
But if you're going to use Wowhead the whole "reading quest logs and searching yourself" becomes futile, so why not save yourself a step and just get Questie?
---
Interesting. Classic wowhead shows that both Hanashi and Sayoc should both be able to sell you two-handed axe training.
---
Yeah I took some bad advice and went skinning and tailoring my first time around. Should have went enchanting and tailoring and am doing that now. People whine about enchanting taking to long to level but honestly, you get so many green drops from questing and you can make plenty with tailoring. The only thing is I have a lot less money than if I were to sell all my greens but I'll get it back when I'm enchanting people's stuff at max level. It's all about that mount!
---
Aka "healers mana tap"
---
Water cooler....hahahaha
---
thanks after hearing all the complaints about mages just rushing in and AoEing the shit outta everything i wanted to play properly and not contribute to the bad reputation. It is nice to understand the dungeon mechanics in classic as retail is so piss easy
---
Europoor
---
Only 8 more hours till I get home and hit lvl 30! This weekend was so good.
---
I haven’t played in many years but I miss the game so much. My most favorite class was the priest where I could be a healer and feel like I was contributing to my group. I literally leveled my priest strictly using the dungeon finder and running dungeons. The micro of the healing addon I was using made it fun.  It was never hard to find a group because the healer is in high demand. 
---
My first ever character class was a Mage and while I enjoyed it, I didn’t find it that fun but I stuck with it and missed out on most of the other classes. 
---
My second favorite is the Paladin. 
---
Maybe you should try healing more and see if you enjoy that role. Or tanking where you are the leader of your group managing the mob pulls. Get beyond the strict DPS classes and try a more specialized role.
---
im on herod.... lol. by noon the queue is generally over 3k, i get off work at 3pm
---
If I had to guess he's probably a warrior under level 40
---
Yeah, i tried them both. Troll couldnt sell me anything and Orc could sell 1 handed axe and daggers..
---
Wierd.
---
Nay. MARRY!
---
I'd like to join too if possible.  Rerolled from Stalagg and I worry about a lower server pop. If we can have a big guild that would solve that problem.
---
Still in Westfall. Still getting fucked by Defias.
---
Still honestly having a great time.
---
How’s classic 2 years later?
---
We did dungeons just fine. We just had to do them twice is all.
---
I would say no, unless you are crazy rich and 80g is nothing for you.
---
Check out skarm tank guide :)
---
https://youtu.be/BirMIEA1oVI
---
Blizzard doesn’t need to do anything. Classic will maintain itself.
---
Just go in, use demoralising roar and spam maul. It's super easy
---
That’s bizarre. Not sure what else to tell you as I’m actually playing Alliance this time around. May be worth opening a GM ticket?
---
Rolling out of the gate with the true Chad class eh?  I hope you accurately briefed her on the struggle ahead.  Although, having a permanent playing partner makes a huge difference for a warrior.
---
It's counterintuitive that it's not in the beast mastery tab
---
Ye you got a point
---
Damn, a man can dream I guess lmao
---
Watch AH prices to see where it might fall. Take offers in trade chat. Can always list on neutral AH as well.
---
Didn't know what to do there so I just clicked. Now I'm going to look into how to play the class better.
---
Logged in earlier and saw that in goldshire. I thought it was a bug. It was still there for an hour. Dunno what happened since i move to westfall already.
---
I understand not all classes need to be doing the same dps etc. I get the classes are hybrids, give buffs etc. But the class design was better in tbc definitely i think. I do love the world in classic though, especially the feeling you are not in the rush which is great.
---
Look at the bottom edge.
---
I am going to argue, that when classic wow is selected as the default: I don’t even register BFA. So ;)
---
Level 32!
---
I remember there were no characters in the private servers, i don't think there ever were 75 of them on retail on a single ship though !!
---
You're doing just fine.
---
Ignore the comments about using Thunder clap on before stance dancing - it's a waste of rage. Spec Tactical Mastery in arms so you stance dance and demo, I'd probably drop the battle shout if you're having rage issues and it's a ranged group.
---
Spamming Demo shout is the best threat generator in AOE for warriors, if you're in a regular group that always try AOE dps then you may want to think about picking up Engineering till the economy stabilises and you can buy your own bombs to generate additional threat on the pull.
---
If rage is your issue get the fastest weapon you can find (I'm currently tanking with a 1.4 speed dagger and loving life).
---
The most important thing to remember is you set the pace of the dungeon, mark things consistently so people know what you want killed first, CC'd etc.
---
If they want to use their AOE abilities they need to wait for you to get a sunder on everything first or you tell them to stop with the AOE. If their still insistent I'd find another group, this is your playtime too at the end of the day!
---
Well see. Not going to bother with a ticket yet. Im sure there is some other way :D
---
I've decided not to leave Darkshore with my hunter untill I get the figurine rare cat from Ruins of Mathystra. Since he is 19-20 when spawned, I do all quests, and grind mobs, taking my time, skinning everything for easy silver, so that I reach 21 still in Darkshore so I have easier time taming him. I secretly laugh inside at the sight of guildies rushing dungeons and quests to only get to endgame faster. I'm reliving my 2007 memories right now.
---
I averaged like 17 I think.
---
Thanks for the helpful and clarifying response.
---
You ever think that the people rushing to 60 actually enjoy playing that way?
---
I’m starting to come to the same realization. I played since 2004, I loved it back then. But now, I can’t stand the extremely low drop rates for looting quests. The gameplay is so boring and simple. Too slow for me. The world first Rag kill within a week leads me to believe people will be bored with the content drought and how generally easy raiding is in classic compared to now
---
Thank you! I did see GetCVar but I didn't realise it could be used like that. Will definitely give this a try tonight.
---
I've read a rumor that you have to have classic settings enabled, could this be true that there is no weather on max settings? Why would it be that way, im thinking it cant be true. Cant even find a setting that says "classic"
---
25.  The mobs just chain pull, it's the goddamned worst.
---
Quests can be a bit repetitive but doing them with other people makes it less boring. You always end up being useful and saving someone from dying and the opposite also happens. I played a bit of retail and leveled a character up to 88 but Classic is so much more fun because of all the interaction between players, whether it's trading, questing, asking for help on something. Try joining a guild, it should make things easier and more fun.
---
Enh to 45 and Respec elemental.
---
I've been looking for a bigger guild myself.  One I found so far with a player base is get off my lawn. They are a casual guild but I've always seen at least a dozen people on.  They have a discord.  Originally on stalagg.
---
I don't agree with this post, but to be fair they have a gif instructing you how to use the drop-down menu to find classic wow as like the main content in the launcher right now. I imagine that's because people were struggling
---
A program called teamviewer
---
You're using the Beast Training skill in your general spellbook tab?
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast Drain Soul
---
    /run PickupContainerItem(4,GetContainerNumSlots(4)) DeleteCursorItem()
---
If you put your soul shard bag on the left most slot this will show the number of soul shards you have on the bag icon. Casts your highest level Soul Drain when used as well as deleting the soul shard in the last slot on the bag, preventing overflow of shards into your general bags. NOTE: This WILL delete whatever is in the last slot of the left most bag even if it is not a soul shard or a shard bag! **DO NOT USE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SOUL SHARD BAG AS YOUR LEFT MOST BAG!**
---
For anyone who sees this: it rules. Was able to remotely use my PC and stay logged in for hours with no latency or delay or anything. Insane how well it worked.
---
No. Lol
---
Being the edgelord that I am, replaced Crescent Staff with Black Duskwood Staff last night for only 4 gold.
---
Whirlwind Axe is overrated when Ravanger drops a few levels later in Armory.
---
IIRC they were added to stop fanning on the ships. I could be mistake.  But nothing like being killed and having you body sail away. Lol
---
i would say its even worse for skinners ...
---
Yeah but it was not the case always in retail. Majority of pvp realms were horde heavy but there was a couple of alliance heavy, like Ravencrest, Sylvanas, The Maelstorm. But currently probably zero pvp server for classic which is alliance heavy. Maybe later.
---
Grats from a level 12 mage.
---
I think I accidentally ninja looted the crossroad supplies from someone. He messaged me EZ ignore as soon as I looted and ignored me, just thought he was killing the mobs for the quest :(
---
There was 4 of us lvl 30-33 helping the priest do the quest horde don’t have quests in westfall he was just killing the escort quest being a dick.
---
Ah. The ole ”we werent actually trying”.

There certainly is a community for it that does care. But the majority just doesn't

Youre still bothering to answer as well. Pot to the kettle and so on...
---
Im not sure I got the rest of your comment though because of your horrible grammar, but if I got it right youre complaining about allies ganking in groups? I never said allies dont do that shit. Its just hypocritical to assume its only an ally thing, both factions do it because there are douchebags playing on both sides, its really just about the individuals.
---
Im too afraid people would vote yes to transmogs...what is this? a democraty??
---
Hit rating 9% eventually, as much Stamina, Agility, armor and crit as possible.. If you can get some dodge gear then great to.
---
You're absolutely correct about wand use. I should have replaced that with Shadow Word: Pain or any other priest dmg spell.
---
Thank you. These threads are worse than anything, who cares how people play the game. Play the game how you want and stop trying to control how others play it.
---
only because your experience has been different doesnt meant that the things i say are only my experience. i did have some encounters and engaging discussions with random players when i was leveling my proffessions, or helping others to get theirs up. but so did i on retail. the part where players keep general chats in places like the barrens alive and going (even if it is only nonsense or chuck norris jokes) are gone because there are way more zones now and players are far to spread over hundreds of realms. i am kinda sure that chats would become more lively if blizzard was to cut off half the realms and merge them into the other half. 
---
i don't disagree that chats are filled more on classic, but for what it's worth, in the 7 days i played so far, it felt like around three quarters of the chat was "WTS (insert random green item here)" "LFG xx im xx class for xxquest or dungeon" or "LFM xx quest or xxdungeon spam, xxcleave or be lvl xx" and yeah, the remaining quarter is probably still more than on retail, cut out the chuck norris and the anal jokes and it seems to be pretty similar. 
---
i do not dislike classic, i do not prefer retail, i am just trying to give neutral arguments about how i see it, and except for me helping push a guys tailoring for 30 points so he could make me some silk bags i did not really have a lot of conversation. most groups for dungeons i was in people went afk til the last people arrived and even those were sometimes just autorun or flight afk
---
I don't think they can. Classic+ is what most people call a potential continuation of classic with new content but activision blizzard isn't capable of making a good game anymore. they'd run classic into the ground.
---
i need to put points to unlock mortal strike
---
Not the same at all. The token doesn't incentivise gold spammers and hackers to inundate players with annoying spam an all the other stuff they do to degrade the experience.
---
Also necessary because you need to respect the 5 second rule.  Whenever you spend mana, your full regen will not start again until 5 seconds after.  I've noticed a lot of people don't realize how important this is.  Is best to kind of use your casts in bursts, when possible, as opposed to slowly trickling them.
---
i am using a fucking staff on my warrior at the moment ... sigh

I've been playing vanilla for the last five years, sporadically. I think it'd suck to see vanilla go away again. I' have nothing against upgrading to TBC if it's done separetely.

Too soon.

I can’t say I blame him. Wow is quite intimidating for a new player especially if it’s retail because there’s just so many expansions already out.

so funny story, i also had this bright idea and i installed the remote desktop and got it all set up, turned on my computer before leaving to work and just a few minutes ago checked to see if there was a queue yet/if i should add myself to it? and i forgot to turn off all my computer's sleep settings..... so im locked out 😬
---
That I can agree with.
---
I'm just saying that going in with 5 well prepared people means that the healer can take care of everyone if they pull aggro, whereas going in with one or two new players or someone who isnjust doing their first run on a character can be more taxing on the mana pool. 
---
I probably should have stated that it's important to be able to gauge how fast your group can go and to know when to hold back.
---
&gt; It's not the rotation that makes raids love you, 
---
Why would your rotation make a raid love you..?
---
Did you level as elemental?
---
Looks like the kind you get from a speed camera here in Chicago
---
Their core strength players from days gone are probably dead or disabled from that sedative lifestyle with lack of sleep and junk food;)
---
What's wrong with Hunter's pets?
---
Just go mage dude, best overall class in the game
---
&gt;  need to put points to unlock mortal strike
---
i  need to put points to unlock mortal strike
---
Also, not all the content is even close to being out yet. You have time
---
or they changed it afterwards maybe, and thats wat are you saying :D
---
I love TBC and liked ish wotlk too.
---
Yet Classic is my main bae.
---
And no - nothing announced and probably not for a Long time seeing as it would be the successor and that would be in 2 years the very earliest.
---
So you gotta be Patient on this
---
I mean...what is the alternative though? Just...hope one of the 5 mobs you've pulled don't go for the healer before you have managed to sunder it?
---
This subreddit is cringeworthy recently...3000 upvotes for this?
---
&gt; I have started leveling as prot to tank. 
---
You can tank any leveling content, and generally all dungeons while playing 31 fury or 31 arms. Prot leveling in classic is basically the most pure form of masochism you can achieve in the game atm.
---
If you want tactical mastery, level your warrior Arms. It's the easiest way, and you'll put your points into Protection after hitting level 40.
---
Good question, I hope someone can shed some light on this.
---
Lvl 25 warrior here with zero issues killing mobs so yeah.
---
No shits given about a streamer.
---
My first character I ever played was a 'lock. I had a blast playing it. Leveling solo was easier since you had a minion. Playing a mage now... A lot of dps but a bit of dying too. Just start one and see how it goes!
---
After 45.
---
See wich is why you wouldn't want a bfa and a classic different tab for battle.net client it would be useless clutter
---
I so need this
---
HAHAHAHAH sorry bro but that was funny, well RIP today, tomorrow we go again
---
Obviously there's nothing new because its the game from the beginning and that is what makes it charming. everything takes longer but in the few days classic is out i had more social interaction than i had in retail for months. Servers and guilds are somewhat pointless in retail, professions also have allmost no use (blacksmith for example).
---
My motivation for longterm wow was and still is the social aspect of the game which retail lacks hard in my opinion
---
big difference between lfg and lfm.
---
bro 😎💪
---
I've tried time and time again to explain to the mages that they need to give the consecration 2 or so ticks before they go balls to the walls AoE DPS, and then we'll be good.
---
And inevitably, they'll go flamestrike into blizzard  before I've even reached the mob pack. :|
---
Yeah they retracted it pretty quickly...
---
Sco/Roger and dew others via Twitter said they weren’t going for it as a guild but would be highlighting individuals and guilds going for it via a Marathon stream.
---
Im almost 36 and am about to farm armory for the tabard! Its BiS
---
Yeah. Takin my time. Lvl 24 and still questing in Barrens. Not trying to rush anything. I want to savor it.
---
Method made a twitter post or something the other day stating that despite misconceptions, they aren't racing for anything. They're just here to play and promote classic
---
ok so enhanc until?
---
Yeah completely normal to sacrifice some AOE threat for little more single target threat. I was just arguing against maul being good AOE threat in itself.
---
That looks exactly like my road to home, when I was playing Pokemon Go!
---
There's not a good way to keep aggro on multiple mobs with a warrior.  Your best/only real tool is Demoralizing Shout.  You can spam that and it'll get you some aggro on all mobs in range.  
---
You could use Thunderclap after your initial charge before you switch to defensive stance, that's the only reason I haven't made/looked for the macro you're talking about.  I believe macros are as simple as 
---
"/charge
---
/defensivestance" 
---
but I haven't made one in ages.  Unlike WotLK and higher, you generally need to CC mobs when there are a bunch, else fight em one at a time as AoE damage will cause them to go after everyone else.
---
Wow cool graphics u got there
---
As a frostie, I know I'm really only wanted in dungeons for sheep and free water for the heals.  
---
But since I'm there I might as well work on leveling my wand skill.
---
The offhand is the Tork Wrench from the Samoflange quest. What’s the main hand?
---
and who the hell cares about assmongrels?
---
99.9% of the player population is not racing.
---
Set your totems in between the mobs you need to kill, so you can use them for multiple fights. Go with a good 2h weapon. Searing totem + stoneskin/strength + healing totem is my go-to
---
I have to drink every 3-4 fights
---
My boar just dinged 15. Not sure what he means
---
But it makes getting drops feel amazing m
---
This.  Orc Tanks, just save your racial ability (Blood Fury) for solo play.  50% heal reduction will make your healer go OOM quick and get you killed.
---
maybe its just nostalgia then lol
---
we already know they struck gold with twitch viewership and google searches related to wow are at a 5 year high, but they quit releasing subs and separating classic/retail/both isn't gonna happen anyway
---
[here is a link to a vid at a specific time where it's discussing twitch successs](https://youtu.be/o9SsdIDMVwA?t=182)
---
My fucking sides.
---
I see you have elememtal talents. Im lvl 43 and wanna respecc to ele at 44. How well do you heal in dungeons as elemental? Does it work as long as you have decent gear?
---
Arclight Spanner from engineering
---
Yeah post it once for 24hrs. No sell=vendor trash
---
Don't use a desktop icon and just launch it from the icon in the install folder? Just a couple extra clicks and provides 'max secrecy' if combined with Alt+F4 closes if someone important pops into the office.
---
Reroll? I never have ques on my medium server.
---
Oh, i see... it's only triggered in combat and idk why=\ Anyway it's working with "buff tracking", not the "weapon enchantment".
---
Even the shield is on point
---
Hilarious omg. Any way to share / save the video directly to share with some friends outta here?
---
prebis is Deathbone.

Yeah! Check it out! https://www.teamviewer.com/nl/download/android/

---
As someone that loves leveling/questing, I agree.
---
I really enjoy healing raids, but also like the sense of adventure of questing with friends and fear of world pvp.  Some of my favorite moments in wow come from world pvp and mingling with other travelers.
---
Wow you're dumb.
---
FWIW, I saw one on the AH yesterday on herod for 225g bo
---
Ambitions as a rider
---
K
---
Skinning AND Herbalism simultaneously is how I'm playing. I get nowhere.
---
I would recommend not looking at one, chances are you’ll never see the items drop in game.
---
I could try .. but i know its really hard to enjoy this game without enough time . You know a raid in classic can take hours and hours
---
It's a person-caused problem, but it's especially reinforced in retail where they can get away with it.
---
This sets up the false expectation that they can get away with it elsewhere.
---
I've taken 3 pets now to 30, not noticed any issues.
---
I would grab the ClassicCastBar Addon, so you can see more clearly that an enemy mob is casting a spell (and what they're casting), so you know better what/when to interrupt.  
---
I added a ton of stuff, so I don't know what added it, but I also got a little tab that can pop out when I'm in a group that has a button for a raid check, and all the skull, X, etc icons for marking, which is super handy.
---
They are going for world firsts but surely they werent for first 60 and or MC first clear.
---
There is just People that have Played Classic the past 15 years. May it be slightly different on private Servers.
---
Method made that decision soooooo late. No Chance they could catch up on that much experience some People have gathered. 
---
I'm sure they will try the other raids but I still don't see them doing anything first besides maybe the occsional first Boss of a new raid. But as for first raid clears I can't see them really. 
---
We will see.
---
I started the chill way. Then I remembered I really don't like the leveling part.
---
I don't have enough free time to actually rush it, but CBA the low levels, as soon as possible I am gonna try to push it hard.
---
Sounds rough.
---
&gt; Classic is way better RP-wise. I'm invested in my main, my pet, my professions, my reputation, helping my fellow alliance, keeping up with the guild community, etc. 
---
Yeah, the only issue I have with Classic currently is the lack of time. To be honest that is the only thing making me not play it over retail currently. In retail, I am able to play a lot more casually and still do raids and such.
---
I log in to do this weeks m+ yesterday got in group ready to go. Okay get to 2nd boss wipe two times people leave. Fine fuck it back to classic
---
Is there a Special reason why you changed spec? Because every guide I read recommends enh all the way.
---
You get conjure mana agate at level 28 :)
---
&gt;whoever gets to it first
---
Healer. By which I mean, me. You guys are doing fine, carry on...
---
You aren't doing anyone a favor you just abuse the reporting system because you don't want to see specific stuff in the chat. I guess you are old and narrow minded, yeah
---
I'm on an rp server it's not allowed!
---
You're actually really on point about the 3D thing - SW has lots of building interiors but they're obviously hidden by walls and everything else is just flat.
---

Addons: Dominos, Shadowed Unit Frames, Kui Nameplates.
---
Op living the true classic experience.
---
I can only imagine the chaos and pain that results when you forget this in a dungeon situation.
---
Why do you think we wanted classic so badly? Because of things like this. Each class felt super unique.
---
I also enjoy having to look for stronger beasts to rank up Claw and Bite, to then give to my main pet.
---
It's cool.
---
Do what you want. Play how you want.
---
Hey is there an add-on that shows when my sheeped mob is about to break?
---
Nobody is forcing you to powerlevel to 60. I don't see any "mob mentality", people play with different priorities and you should accept this.
---
It stands for “Doctor of Medicine,” just another degree you can get between sunders
---
You're beneath me.
---
MC and ONY are super easy in this patch (those raids were over a year old when 1.12 was released) and were tanked by clothies for shits and giggles. ony was also 5 manned in 1.12. you can do whatever you want for those raids
---
you won't be able to get away with that shit in naxx, it was a few months old when 1.12 came out but even after that, less than 100 guilds cleared it before bc 6 months later. 
---
bwl and AQ will probably be a mixture of both but you need to be open to healing when it comes to some of the tougher raids or you may not get a spot because most guild will still never clear naxx
---
Enchanting Before level 25+ is total bullshit. I see why he did what he did, but that's just not cool to need for enchanting without asking.
---
Lvl 35, still using that sexy beast of a hammer. It has slain many mobs and overly enthusiastic Horde.
---
Fair enough. So do you then claim that players who leveled in raid groups in classic were all aware that this was a mistake and sought maliciously to abuse it to as great an extent possible before it was fixed? That is my issue with all of the negative framing. Players were just trying to keep pace with their friends. I don’t know a single player who had any clue that it was incorrect. It was never discussed as an “exploit.”
---
I spent 2 hours last night at Northwatch hold trying to kill those three bosses! Those healer mobs nearly succeeded in causing me to rage quit so many times.
---
ES basically is taunt. Macro multiple ranks of it for mana efficiency. Max rank for taunt, lower ranks for threat builder.
---
WoW classic isn't very demanding on hardware. Anything with a relatively recent i5 processor and some kind of dedicated graphics card (2gb+) will likely run it at the framerates you're after, and won't cost you an arm and a leg.
---
Yeah.. I don't really go by this either. Letting dps drop just prolongs the fight or even wipes the group due to waning mana.
---
Thats exactly what ive done for the last 2 xpacs. Come back play the release level up get bored leave. Decide hey its been a while ill give it another shot, play for  a couple days leave until new xpac.
---
Wait till you still have ww axe at 52 and see how stronk you feel
---
Stop giving away the Remote Desktop secrets!
---
Because if you do that, you have to log in and click your server every time.
---
The least the bnet client could do is put classic in the right-click menu of the tray icon.
---
Why is this not top comment?
---
I just hunter mark them and then wave. Bring it on
---
I just use 144, even tho my screen is 60hz 
---
Looks and feels buttery smooth on max
---
D: Can I go back to not knowing this?
---
Never tell me the odds.
---
I want to know too!
---
still waiting for faerlina que to end so i can play my priest hes still level 1 :D 
---
no rush !!!! phase two isnt for what? like another YEAR?
---
I guess I'd just heal them once they ask for it to avoid drama. :o
---
I am actually going to reroll my NELF rogue to a human tonight (being an ex Horde I didn't realise how tall they are). While I am at it, I am going engineering.
---
Sure, it'll set me back 20 levels but who cares. Levelling is fun.
---
Did he attack first? But tauren are bros. :(
---
I am going for miner and skinner till 60 and then drop skinning  for engineering for the ammo bombs and stuns
---
You make a good case, and the gods love a tryer (sp?), but unfortunately I think the person you are replying to lacks much of a reasoning capability.
---
Those boots were the first epic I ever got back in 2006. I still remember they dropped off some trash mob in Maraudon.
---
Make the shortcut to wow.exe not wowlauncher.exe
---
Yea its 0.0015 or something from what I've seen elsewhere on reddit?
---
So instead of taking action against behavior you urge others to avoid, you do nothing other than ask people to avoid partaking in said behavior?  Way to have conviction!
---
I leveled a prot warrior 1-60 in vanilla, it was awful.
---
Its not mine either, and I did have something to say and I did. I just legitimately had a hard time understanding that gibberish.
---
Yeah, ran RFC for the first time in all grey gear at level 12, alongside a lvl 18 warlock. It was a painful experience!
---
why he wasnt one of those 21 ppl that still dont know it :P
---
I remember getting at least a couple hundred if not more for that back in vanilla, gratz!
---
This guy is a loser
---
Can someone explain what a world drop is? How is it different to regular loot and where does it come from?
---
precisely why I chose an RP-PVP server. An elegant people for a more civilized age.
---
This man asking the real questions!
---
What is the add on for the bar you've got at the top?
---
&gt;You think you're good because you look like a croquet league
---
Horde just jelly they ain't getting those little triangle sandwiches after our croquet games.
---
Speak about wholesome, deserves to be upvoted to shit
---
Karma farming...Next!
---
With you on this. Was progression tough, back when I used to do it? Sure. Was logging on to wipe again and again for hours multiple times a week something that sometimes felt like a job? Yeah.
---
And I loved it.
---
Have your tried a different zone with lower levels maybe? At lvl 25 you could do ashenvale, wetlands, duskwood then mix in some dungeons like stockades and BFD.
---
If all else else fails group with someone :)
---
Gz!
---
I'm a noob Hunter. I've never played the class before and giving it the ol' college try this time around. What are generally regarded as the best pet types for: 1) qrinding 2) general soloing/questing 3) dungeons?
---
I am level 30 and using an owl I tamed. I fucking love the Screech sound more than life. I know the debuff is nice but is it optimal? Should I be using a cat or wolf or a 'tanky' pet for general questing/grinding? From doing some reading it seems that wolves are decent in endgame for the Furious Howl buff but I'm so far removed from endgame right now that I don't care about that yet.
---
I honestly usually dismiss my pet during dungeons because I'm afraid of pulling aggro (even when disabling Growl) or just aggoring packs around corners etc, or if we jump down off a cliff and the pet pathing grabs things. Of course this sucks since my pet is a huge chunk of my DPS (leveling BM) but w/e I mostly dungeon with friends anyway
---
Should be able to if you use something like elvui.
---
 First kill back in the day was on a dwarf warrior. Remember it vaguely. Was in stonetalon mountains and hadn't been in any PvP encounter yet. Suddenly there is one horde  coming at me attacking. Heart started to race, defended myself and manage to win. Felt pretty awesome.
---
 On new Classic I have only been the punching bag so far. Playing a warlock level 28. I have a live and let live policy so I just ignore any horde I see. Don't like to attack people at low health killing mobs or whatnot either.
---
 Been in around 10 PvP situations so far and have gotten killed in around half of them. A couple of times in Ashenvale a group of horde ganking me. Then some ?? level undead mage blasted me down when I was at low health questing at one point. Also had an interesting experience doing my succubus quest at level 21. As an alliance warlock you have to run from ratchet to the middle of the barrens below the crossroads. Somehow managed to do it while getting chased and attacked a lot.
---
gtx 970
---
That's rough.
---
Haven't had any outages but ping hops were brutal two nights ago. Trying to peel off mob packs when one's ping is spiking from 37 to 270 irregularly is enough to pull hair out.
---
I can't go to yemen.. I'm an analyst!
---
Lokhe is a ganker;)
---
Hell even Rethban ore from Redridge, just a quest item, sells on the AH for a not-terrible price. Its a rough area to do alone so a lot of people obviously buy them.
---
Keep Thorns on yourself
---
whats tht addon for the top bar?
---
&gt; if there's one thing retail does well is creating challenging pve, most people won't be able to clear mythic and even heroic at times without a carry
---
I'm sure its "challenging". But **if you played it for 12+ years do you think it would still be challenging?** In a few months from new content release about **3%** of the wow population will have cleared the pinnacle of retail PVE. That's a very high percentage of the player-base that's considered "top tier". Put that into perspective with much bigger competitive games tfe: CSGO, DOTA2, LOL where just reaching the top rank means you are indisputably sub 1%
---
How hard is retail PVE if such a large % of players end up clearing it and how do you even measure difficulty? Why are mythic raiding references a mainstay in every classic PVE thread...
---
&gt; I enjoy both, but interesting mechanics are good for every game period.
---
When does "interesting" become tedious? The 3rd time you run it? 5th? 68th? Its always the same in PVE, its hype while you progress, even if you've cleared Nax on your last two servers and this will be your 19th time on Kel its still a nice achievement and moment to have with your buds. That being said, after 2-3 runs the whole thing becomes a chore, retail or not.
---
Like I said in the original post, the simple nature of classic PVE is IMO its best feature. You can speedrun it and obsess over the min/max/dpsflex, or you can sit back and relax. Whats even better, is that on PVP servers, the other faction can PROPPERFUCK your min/maxing over if your members have loose lips, poor planning or shitty in-game mechanics.
---
Instead of being a isolated event on some random ass cloud server where you all safely meet up and masturbate over how fucking pro you are at juggling, PVE in classic is mostly just collecting resources to ether progress your class fantasy, preparation for a parsed run or simply a tool to further your guilds interests and power on the server.
---
Yeah I even picked out the perfect hair for it too.
---
I've had a few people ask me if I did and I make a big show of revealing it when I take my helm off lol.
---
&gt; if there are other people run in with them and tag what you can
---
Nobody's around.
---
&gt;You have frostnova and blink if it gets too much.
---
Yeah no fucking shit.  And when you blink into enemies oh man what happens.
---
"Try applying damage dealing spells to the enemy until they die."
---
Top tier advice.  Thanks.
---
Just gonna throw a quick renew on the tank and pick some flowers by myself.
---
Yeah it's hilarious to me that people think they are going to get left behind before DM even comes out.
---
You should try to find people who got similar preferences in the game as you. Why would you want to force your playstily on a whole dungeon group instead of just leaving and organizing a more laid-back run?
---
It seems to me that if everyone around you is a tryhard and cringeworthy etc. then they are not the problem.
---
find another guild. you WILL kill shit faster as dps but the point is to have fun and if you're having fun, then fuck them.
---
When doing low level dungeons should lesser heal and heal be treated as heal and greater heal? Is that good practice?
---
I too have been at consistently low health, or outright murdered by standard mobs.
---
Fair enough, I don't exactly know why this has got under my skin to be honest.
---
Maybe it's an echo of the kind of conversation I was having in 2007 and I guess I'm still saw that I lost that battle lol.
---
Thats nice of you. Some of us are very unlucky with bag drops.
---
i want to be part of that
---
Guys FYI Glassburken directly translates to ”The ice cream jar”
---
Yes. That's also why I immediately deleted the post after reaching a score of 0.
---
That's the thing, you can't really ask "is X stat for Y class in Z spec" without specifying the content one is doing. Questing in a contested shitshow like Ashenvale? Stam is the only stat I care about, doesn't matter what class/spec. Casual grinding out in Azshara? Time to stack spirit.
---
Level as arms, not prot. You can still tank dungeons but it will drastically improve damage
---
Definitely am! I'll be off work in about an hour, when i eat and do the boring stuff, I'll log on. Nice to meet you, name is Wildflower. Looking forward to meeting you ig.
---
Thanks for the clarifications guys. :)
---
LF MAGES SM GY SPAM
---
Thissss.
---
Shield warrior tanks when: 
---
Spell hit coming
---
Danger low
---
What pisses me off is tanks still grabbing groups of mobs.  Like dude, we can only effectively attack one thing at a time anyway.  Everyone's AOE is bad.  All you're doing is wasting the healer's mana and risking a wipe.  So you're not even doing the dungeon faster.  If anything it's slower because now you have to wait for mana.
---
I went straight up 5/5 wand specialization off the bat and its glorious. Only 14 LVL right now but I'm flying
---
"Retarded means slow, was he slow?"
---
Someone should remix the Onixia wipe to fit the Baby Driver scene.
---
Your friend is right. It really doesn't make that much of a difference what spec you are for healing until you're healing endgame dungeons/raids. Just keep some int/spirit gear you find and you're gonna be fine.
---
The quickest to level is Enhancement, but if you want to stick with resto, it's fine. It'll be slower, but who cares if you're having fun?
---
How often would you say someone like that re-specs? Every week?
---
Lmao, making a ton of them just through questing :)
---
Any way to check the statistics on a particular server? e.g. class populations/distribution, alliance vs horde populations.
---
If you're on an iPhone, I can't recommend Apollo enough. It's a great Reddit app.
---
On Android, I always hear people mention an app called "Reddit Is Fun" but I've never used it.
---
I play priest on retail sometimes.
---
Maybe I should look more into it on classic.
---
I wonder is it okay viable for dps tho
---
What would that look like. So far I'm doing 5 spirit tap and 5 wand dmg in disipine
---
The mobs outside of the instance are elites in Classic. It's not that easy for many people to solo them. There is also competition outside and fewer serpentbloom spawns.
---
Also a CoD 1 (vcod) legend. Played with many clanmates in both vCoD and WoW. Best time of my 14 year old life. See you in Carentan soldier.
---
What I will remember from this is that Clara has big tits.
---
Thats it
---
Yes. For some weird reason Priest has 3 differnt spells names for "my most mana-efficient single-target-heal at the time" whereas it is just one for the druid's healing touch.
---
So downranking "Heal" below Rank 1 simply is "Lesser Heal".
---
I didn't mention it for downranking as spells that you learn below level 20 get a huge spellpower-coefficient-malus which means you won't downrank any lower than Heal(Rank 2).
---
I know it's the best and that what's makes feral even remotely decent. I just dislike the idea of not staying in form to deal damage. Feels kinda counterproductive and not something we should be doing.
---
It would be like a Dps Warrior having to switch into Defensive Stance and use Revenge every 3 seconds and then switch back to Berserker Stance because it does massive damage. (Revenge damage sucks but just as example)
---
Well, yeah, there are exceptions, but if you're focused on them then you gotta take a deep breath.
---
Whoosh.
---
I hope!!
---
in this phase (phase 1) you get nothing
---
in the next phase you can rank up with spezial points for honorable kills (killing people near your level), you get gear for that as far as i know
---
Oh ok, nice. Thank you
---
As of now, you really get nothing. In later phases you'll gain honor, which will be used for various pvp gear and items.
---
I'm with you man.  Spread that shit out.
---
I think it also depends on how long the dungeons are too. WC is fucking huge. The few times i did it, i walked out if there with my bags completely full. I had to delete items in WC to loot things that would sell more.
---
When i went to BFD, i didnt fill all my bags. That being said, i always seem to get more money out of a dungeon run (with quests) than i would questing around for a level
---
it is very similar in term of gameplay.
---
Combat is similar (4-5 spells that you spam).
---
You pull tons of enemies.
---
as for loot all mmorpgs/looter games whether action rpg mmo or shooter/sci-fi mmo or a fantasy mmo have become normal multiplayer games and lost the MMO DNA.
---
Loot is randomized and normalized.
---
You don't run into people organically in the world.
---
All content is instanced.
---
What is the difference between sitting in a menu screen in a COD or PUBG game waiting for queue to play a match, and waiting in a city or hub waiting for a queue to get teleported there and back when done? Some people will say go explore nothing is stopping you. But people don't do things without incentive. And the whole design of today's MMO games, no matter the genre is much closer to multiplayer games than it is to actual mmo.
---
This feeling will change. Each time someone kills me while in combat with mobs. I kill the next 3 people I see. I had a rogue in hillsbarad follow me around for 30 minutes yesterday. You will stop caring about inconveniencing the opposing faction.
---
AHHHH FUCK GUYS. People have fun in different ways. That's why classic is good. Some people race. Some people minmax. Some people socialise. Nobody is better than anyone else. Everyone can enjoy the game in their own way. Yay peace joy love wee woo wee.
---
I’ve got an undead priest at level 4, what race is your warrior?
---
Nice job! I'm very tempted to roll a shaman as my 2nd character, how was the leveling experience?

Hhahahah I’m dead
---
Shaman fire totem quest
---
Did this in Goldshire day 3, people got super happy =D keep up the good work mate!
---
I thought I wouldn't like it ... I was one of those that said ...why would i play a 15 year old game which is poorly made (not for that time, but for current standards)  
---
Now I am level 34 and counting ... and enjoying it more and more every level. What happend to me!?
---
Now that’s a bruh moment
---
Currently there is no reward.
---
From Phase 2 onwards you'll get Honor points for killing enemy players. The more honor points you get the higher your rank, and you gain access to equipment you can buy as you go up the ranks.
---
You do not receive anything from the dead player themselves. You can't loot their items or money.
---
I have a Level 19 Hunter, a Level 6 Warlock and a Level 5 Priest. I‘m taking my sweet time and I‘m loving it. Leveling professions, fishing and just enjoying the ride.
---
I used to have that song on loop when I played, and that episode is the reason I started drinking rockstar during late nights.
---
Yes. If you need it, roll for it. Armor class doesn't mean that much in classic.
---
I’ll try that. Thanks man.
---
Yeah its your problem you are clumsy and destroy everthing while killing them. I got my 4 hooves in 5 kills :D
---
I'm loving Aspect of the Cheetah.
---
I never played WoW before, vanilla or current, but started playing vanilla for fun with my friends. I am a 25 Tauren Druid now. What are the main things I should know as such a character?
---
Easy Karma x)
---
I mean there's no leveling police out to get ya. Do whatever the fuck you want.
---
I have been watching the shaman race on Stalagg as a shaman main myself. Glad to see it, congrats!
---
Are you on Grobbulus by chance?
---
I love it when people tell other people how to play
---
Thats what i feared, plus all the T Sets only for heal.
---
You dont get anything at all until phase 2.  In phase 2 you get honor points which accrue towards your rank.  Based on your rank, you will gain access to BUY certain pieces of gear with gold.  The higher your rank, the higher quality gear you will have access to purchase.  
---
No items will be dropped in your lap from doing PvP.  However, there are battleground related quests and reputations that will award items, or rep to unlock the ability to buy items.
---
Is there anywhere i can view the current class distributions for classic? 
---
If not, what is your guys anecdoctal experiences in this regard? 
---
I’m trying to not roll an overpopulated class.
---
Warriors know this feel
---
This is good news for me. A friend is catching up to me very fast, but he is a BL fan, so I guess I got a window there to ge to 60 haha (dont worry, I take it slow)
---
just play WoW on work
---
soon you won't have a job to worry about
---
Am i at the level where I would normally get black lotus or devilsaur leather, no
---
Am I a skinner or herbalist, no
---
What else you got?
---
Well, it's not entirely true. Now that every area under lvl 60 is scaled to your level, you can pick almost any destination. You can also go in Northrend from level 58 which is pretty awesome.
---
Never did

---
Racing to 60 and stressing about how you're "missing out" and whatever is how you take this from a fun game to a fucking nightmare. 
---
This is not a fast game. And when you reach 60, what waits for you is more grinding. Just chill out and enjoy yourself, the game is going nowhere.
---
This is why skinning is best. You'll easily lvl it while questing.
---
I've been playing WoW every day for the last week, about 3-5 hours per day. I'm still level 21.
---
Not that I'm arguing, because I stay far away from the new design, but you *can* collapse comment strings on it. Just wanted to let you know. Each comment has a line running down the left side, you have to click that line. Definitely not as intuitive but it is possible.
---
if I wanted one I'd squeeze your head
---
lmao what is the point of these posts
---
Means he needs to go back to retail
---
50-60 is the easiest part of leveling.
---
30-50 is the worst.
---
Yep.
---
I really want 60 as fast as possible
---
..but I only get 2ish hours a day at most
---
I casually mentioned this to our healer the other day. I was in bear form and tanking and having trouble getting rage on group pulls. Dude said that I can heal myself if i don't want the shield... hopefully he quits and goes back to retail soon.
---
It depends how efficient you are at grinding through quests and it depends what class you rolled. Hunters/shamans/druids can move around faster. Mages can aoe farm if specced properly. Dungeons are quick XP if your group is clearing them quickly and rarely if ever wiping. It all comes down to how quickly and efficiently you are getting through it. A lot of people stick to grinding SM runs from 30-40 because it's faster than dicking around in zones of that level dealing with all the non sense that comes with them, STV for example.
---
height &gt; face
---
As a paladin who needs a healing gear set and a tank/dps gear, I feel bad.  But hey man, I offer to heal, dps, and pretty soon tank everything.  I need the gear and for healing I'll take cloth, leather, mail.
---
Wait for STV man, I'm pretty ahead of the curve but that place was a nightmare from beginning to end. I'm lvl 46 now and many of the Horde I encounter have no interested in ganking anymore.
---
Yeah, they really seem to like the art of creating their ideas in a virtual world and are happy to sacrifice what people love about that world to do it.
---
This is a ridiculous attitude to have. There are groups of people who will eventually raid that haven’t even started playing yet. No one cares when you get to 60, getting discouraged because people are leveling faster than you is childish and against the entire spirit of the game. Is has been one week since launch, you are not “too late to raid”
---
Fantastic.

I am currently lvl 43 and had specced Axe. It was really good with ww Axe and bonebiter. Yesterday i got my hands in the sword from uldaman endboss and switchen to sword spec. It was only 1g. It should Last a while.
---
But staying Axe is probably cheepest since many good axes till 60 are available.
---
that was my first world epic ever...  i think I ended up with a two in all of vanilla
---
I think I will. Leaning either that or Hunter, or maybe rogue.  havent decided.
---
The played time is right there in the screenshot.
---
I just hit 13 the other day. I am loving every second of it. The suicide walk from Menethil Harbor to Ironforge was hilarious and a huge highlight of my night elf's journey.
---
I agree, but I can't type Moon symbol on keyboard, so I used X and O
---
I’m running a druid so I have a little more survivability than most classes besides Pally, but yeah 3 mobs all at my level is always playing really close to the line, and 4 is a death sentence.
---
I'm just hear to listen to Cullen Rutherford say one of his 2 lines in that movie. lol.
---
That's true, but they are lower leveled, so you can easily do them with just one other person in a group. You don't have to spend time finding a whole group.

No duel wealding for shamans till bc and no two handed duelweilding till wrath for warriors
---
One of the primary mage abilities along with hotball.
---
Bank?¿
---
Because back in classic people didn’t understand the systems and blizzard didn’t “teach them” at all. 
---
A large number wouldn’t know how to store their pet. Go out and tame another. Use it until you learned the skill. Go back and pull out said pet and train it with the new skill. They just used it with whatever rank the pet came with. 
---
So to a large number of the population these mechanics “didn’t exist”.

Did you just come here to basically bash someone's excitement?...ain't you something.
---
OP good on you for coming back and I hope to see you on the fields. Dont forget to buff your faction and welcome home.
---
my nostalgia would be grinding mobs in blasted lands for 12 hours for 39-40 to get my mount lol, not doing that again
---
Are those keys as tiny as they look? Game would be difficult to play.
---
This makes sense for the Barrens, since it's a savannah style biome. No trees or tall mountains to block out the glow from the moon. I doubtt it rains much there, either. I've seen a torrential downpour twice now in Darkshore and Westfall, and even a foggy night in the Wetlands.
---
Once you travel out of the desert style zones of eastern Kalimdor you should see more diverse weather.

r/relationship advice:

"So my boyfriend is now playing this shitty fucking game called WoW for about 1-2 hours a day, so I destroyed the photo album he has with pictures of his family. Am I The Asshole?"
---
"*You male or female?*"
---
"Female."
---
"*NOT THE ASSHOLE! Girl, he clearly doesn't respect you or your life or your family or your baby and you need to purge him from your life and get him fired from his job. An hour or two. A day? THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR! DO NOT BE HIS VICTIM!*"
---
&gt;A large amount of people here seem so stressed out about reaching 60 as fast as humanly possible. 
---
Different people have different aim and different way to enjoy the game
---
&gt;There is no rush. Stressing about reaching 60
---
It's like telling people that are depressed : you should stop feeling depressed
---
That's not going to solve it
---
can you please come back in 10-15 years when you understand how you actually develop a conversation?  :)
---
The people saying stuff like "I have a job! I don't care about rushing to 60! Stop and smell the roses!" are even more annoying than the people without jobs who are rushing to 60 and clearing MC.
---
It seems to me that people in the former category are mainly irritated by the existence of people in the latter category.  If they really didn't care about people rushing to 60 and they were really content taking their time then they wouldn't feel the need to constantly make these posts.
---
The world! Bfa zones look amazing. But everything is so tightly packed, quest hubs just a stop on the way. I cant name a single quest hub location in bfa, except the main city. It doesnt feel like a world at all.
---
If wow classic does well, it’s a stunning rebuke of the current state of the retail experience.  Personally I only came back for classic because retail lost its way long ago.  In my ideal world, they fork classic into an alternative time line and never add the stupid shit from BC, WotLC, Cata, panda, draenor, legion, or bfa.
---
You don't have to enter the authenticator every time either, just from a new location I think
---
Private servers sucks balls, why would I play them.
---
The *hardest* content? Fuckin Normal Azshara would be by a distance the hardest boss in vanilla. 
---
I think the meme comes from people who haven't actually played retail in years intentionally spreading misinformation, or clowns who can only do LFR.
---
Blizzard is being bigoted against my 13-year-old sense of humor
---
Depends, are you speeding up? Then they force their playstyle on you. Are you keeping your regular speed? You are both forcing playstyle on each other. Are you slowing down? You are forcing your playstyle on the other. There is no right or wrong playstyle, it's just a waste of everyone's time if none is enjoying it. That's why: look for groups that fit your playstyle.
---
If there is an issue with hunter pets, it is so small that you will not notice.  There is nothing wrong with hunters.
---
I approve of this meme template.
---
*Laughs in remote*
---
simply do not heal locks over 50% hp. they can handle it.
---
Gotcha thanks
---
Job. I took time off last week for this but now its back to the rl grind.
---
It was my understanding that pally tanks were essentially not viable in classic, does this hold true and if so at what point do they stop being viable?
---
APES are probably the most experienced vanilla/classic wow players across the entire player base. I’ve played against these guys for a couple years every now and then as a horde player. They know their shit PvP and PvE, and are very coordinated together. I don’t know what they do for a career though, it seems they are always rushing every server first in existence for vanilla/classic and I wonder how they stay funded.
---
f
---
Much much more
---
At least it wasn't "my little brother"
---
Where is he?!
---
DE everything below 20s in value, buy a few mats on AH when i got stuck. DE mos things i made with tailroing unless i could buy the mats cheaper on AH.
---
I'm Level 24 and my guildies are ~38... Idgaf about lol, I just level my character, make groups with random people and quest with them and do dungeons. It's Hella more fun than watching the race streamers getting their will of live sucked out of them.
---
I can already picture a scarlet Scarlet Monastery
---
r/im14andthisisdeep
---
Or you get a fairly tutorial leveling experience with cata. 
---
Especially, because after a point you don’t use it anymore anyway. After you get all the skills you never deal with it again. It’s just a few hours at max level then you forget about the mechanic.
---
Only the bosses are lvl 20, the rest of the mobs are 17-18
---
last time in retail they introduced this powerfull worlddrops it was in legion with legendaries, they had to nerf them because people tought it was "mandatory" to have them ...
---
Why does it require a trip to Darnassus?
---
Rattlegore's highest level is like, 50, and the majority of the population is still in the level 20s area (I am only 18-19 myself).  Our server is still full with a slight queue on peak hours, so I think you might be on to something.  Happy to slowly creep up to 60 and enjoy it for what it is.
---
Less input lag and less tearing.
---
lul
---
super proud a fellow Tauren Shaman is the first 60 on my server! I’ll come pay a tribute to you master Clouds!
---
Seriously this. I've seen people LFM for stocks 25+ and they are only 21 or 22. I've also seen the same for deadmines. They do the same shit in retail (with gear score) and I can't stand it
---
Play the game how you want, obviously. But a thread like this does serve a purpose more than a simple attempt at antagonizing people not playing how they're advocating. 
---
Level 60 has been reached. Ragnaros and Onyxia are down. General chat, trade chat etc is constantly filled with people forming Scarlet Monastery grind and rush runs. We all perceive group pressure and mentality differently, and some people will probably be put off by that as a result. Thinking they got to go fast or else they'll miss out on the experience. 
---
At the end of the day there's not a lot of endgame in phase 1. Most classes don't even benefit that hugely from the gear. There's no battlegrounds, no honor system. There's two raids. If you're worried you're missing out; you won't. Things won't really kick into overdrive until at least phase 2 if not until phase 3. That's months and months from now (in all likelihood).
---
Hunters are weird.
---
You are playing it the right way!
---
Prot pallies are prob the closest you can get to that in classic. They lack taunt/bubble taunt but can spec in consecration and improved righteous fury and are pretty solid dungeon tanks. 
---
Like warriors they still need a little time for threat, but consecration builds up faster than thunderclap does for big pulls.
---
I've been spamming the smaller heals to avoid using the bigger ones at the wrong time and wasting mana. I now understand that I am ironically wasting more mana by doing so.
---
A) why are you using questie? B) if you have the same quests as them your quest feed will tell you
---
So the xp values are exactly what they were in vanilla? I never remember getting such a large chunk of a level through a dungeon run back in the day. I’m not ready to quit over it but it does seem different.
---
BRD I did from like 53 on, some lbrs, and 59-60 I closed out in winterspring. We changed it up a lot in brd to not get bored, sometimes arena runs, sometimes to the 7, sometimes full.
---
I can't even tell if you're sarcastic or not..
---
I'm with /u/Pls_Send_Steam_Codes here. Driving is a horribly analogy because there are concrete rules in place, and serious safety risks involved. Just caus you looked at a thing doesn't make it yours.
---
Yeah, it is as if everyone plays this game just to relax. Not to rush to endgame, play the game and then quit. Feels awesome
---
Anyway to get real mob health working with it? Sick if seeing % and not actual numbers
---
I got the 0.15% from wowhead
---
Only issue I have is when I swap it always chooses US for me when I used EU the last time, so sometimes have to exit/choose/start again. I'm fine with them being on the same tab tbh, but at the same time support your petition.
---
I guess they got the money to feed their pets special cooked food from needing all the items.
---
As a new priest this thread was super helpful thanks and I’ll keep that in mind from now on!
---
I have always mained a warrior, going all the way back to Vanilla. The difference is that I (and most players) were very bad back in 2006. My talents were split between all 3 specs, and my gear was a lot of leather and agility because i liked to crit lol. And I used a regular mouse and clicked everything and used NO addons.
---
NOW I get to redo everything as a much more experienced player. It is still dogshit hard and frustrating lol, but I am definitely able to do things a bit more over par than I could way back then. Getting dual wield at 20 helped a ton due to rage generation.
---
It's only a bad thing if you wipe, the whole go slow and cc mobs, pull as small as possible etc, is to make sure you don't die. If your group is chain pulling and living, then you are actually using your stats, skills, abilities well and are rewarded by having time to do more dungeon or more leveling. If you chain oull and die, well you are punished with having less rewards. So are your groups dying or winning?
---
Fuck dude, I bought the game yesterday and first name that I picked was 'Ilovetits'. Pray for me pls :P.
---
I feel like the largest chunk is 25-35 now, gauging by my zones being well populated and the dungeon lfg in trade chat. It's going to be harder for some things. But less competition on mobs will help you out as well.
---
Its honestly a lovely feeling - it can be dangerous for some but I have the self control and balance to still go to work, talk to my friends, get laundry done while maximising my game time and having a blast. Its a feeling I've sorely missed.
---
Holy fuck, i watched this guys stream for about 5 minutes - what an asshole. Retail star, i suppose? I don't understand how 75.000 people watch this idiot. mediocre play, no clue and such a big mouth.
---
Yea I think I will stick around for some time. It did have that feeling of old. Sort of an alternative life. Much less about gaming itself. More just progressing slowly as one does in real life. 
---
I wonder. Vanilla wow seemed to draw in a lot of females that would not touch other games. Some good looking females that I think were in it for the social aspect. A place they could faff about and do whatever they wanted. I remember meeting a few and taking to many and my mate did more “intimate” things with a few of them. I wonder if classic will draw the same “audience”. Not that it matters much anymore as both me and my mate are getting old. But it was a fun social element. Games I have played after vanilla and “modern day” wow seem to have scared ofc all those elements of the opposite sex.
---
Look into a discipline priest. I think that’s available. I don’t remember the meta for classic. I played by mainly dealing dps damage which would heal the closest group members and then I could focus on healing if I needed to. I had a lot of fun with it keeping my team alive. 
---
The addon I had grouped all the health bars together so I could just click the bar and it would select the actual player. It’s been so long since I played. 
---
I’ve always wanted to try a Rogue and Warlock too. If I was to ever play again, I’d probably try a Warlock.
---
Yup, only level 20 rn. The only sad thing is some lower areas are a lot less populated (which is nice because spawns and not nice because grouping and less chat in local).
---
What is the group addon?
---
Should've actually. People mistake it for "Should of" because it sounds very similar.
---
So I am using two gathering professions until 60 then engineering and blacksmithing after. I also set up a banking toon straight off.
---
Same here I look up stuff on wowhead all the time. I like to try to figure it out on my own but if it's too fucked or hard to understand I just look it up. Honestly thats the most enjoyable way to play imo.
---
&gt;again, it had been cleared a few times already so it was definitely doable. 
---
You still needed a ridiculous amount of tanks for 4HM. My guild didn't even bother with it at this point anymore (tho, it was only a week left till BC, so ...).
---
By "overtuned" I am mostly talking about 4HM and how wildely different difficulties the bosses had. Most were quite easy but a few were just ridiculous compared to them.
---
I still don't know what the intended difficulty actually was.
---
Sorry read your post to quickly.
---
&gt;  "can you not die to the boss mechanics". 
---
Blink and Ice Block is amazing for that, more Blink tho due to it's short CD.
---
Lok'tar brother! It's going to get worse before it gets better. Right now my food takes longer to regen my hp than the actual pulls. Let's not begin to talk about how much gold I've spent on food and the mages I've spammed pleading for some arcane bread.
---
But oh boy it's gonna be worth it my friend.
---
Honestly, I feel this post is pointless.  Who cares?  Who honestly cares?  People enjoy racing to 60 to get that *one single achievement* that no one else on the server can have for their class (or overall).  Big deal if they are rushing through the game.  What part of that is affecting the rest of us?  Not a single thing.  I don't even see them because they are well ahead in another zone that I won't be seeing for months.
---
And they are generally rushing one single class because doing multiple at the same time won't lead you to winning anything.  So once they hit 60, they are more than welcome to make a new class and take it slow and easy.  Perhaps they are rushing a class they don't even care to play for the long run but it's easier to level.
---
The bottom line is those who are rushing to 60 are more than welcome to "stress out" and push to be first.
---
If there are people who are "stressing out" because they are "in between" somehow, all they have to do is look at who are all in the upper levels for the various classes and realize they aren't going to be caught and just don't worry about it.  Unless they are one level off, maybe two, you aren't going to catch them because they are those who are going to be staying home from work and just pushing.
---
Besides, the game's been out for a week.  One player already hit 60 overall on the Frost Mage, so that is out of the question anyway.
---
The problem is that a lot of healers and tanks have god complexes since they control through various means the pace of the group. 
---
"It's just trading the healer's mana for the lock's mana."
---
More like, "It's allowing the lock and healer to share a mana pool, which vastly increases the lock's damage output." 
---
But they don't wanna view it that way because they want the dungeon to be run on their terms, rather than the terms of what is best.
---
Nostalgia didn't make private servers as popular as they were for 14 years straight. Classic has already exceeded expectations. They had to emergency launch how many realms this week? Is it really so hard to comprehend that players want an actual challenge in their video game to overcome instead of cross realm level scaled zones and hand holding?
---
Same. Would like to know too.
---
I’m with you guys on this. I enjoy the competitiveness of being max level. I totally enjoy the game along the way too. You can speed level questing and enjoy the game, make friends, etc. I have hundreds of DAYS on vanilla bc and wrath. I hated not being 60 in classic tbh.
---
It seems like +dmg of some school of magic affect wands, got shadowm dmg wand, and changed to shadow spec at 42 as priest and my wand hit harder even i lost 3 point in wand specialization
---
Forget the launcher, I just want the addon sites to separate it out better.  Browsing for add-ons has been a pain in the ass.
---
if there are more than 1 mobs - especially not in range for Thunderclap, renewing will draw aggro
---
First, difficulty is highly subjective. Some people don’t find much in retail or Classic particularly difficult. Ultimately, it depends on the fights for both, really.
---
Some MC fights are little more than faceroll. Same for LFR. But there’s also some in each that have a bit more to them.
---
I haven’t done LFR in BFA, but I know some fights in Legion could cockblock an LFR group for much longer than it should. But on the same can and will happen in MC, even on the easier fights.
---
I'm a little confused if this is directed at me or if you're just adding this on as a separate point.
---
Was in RFC yesterday, had a warr tank. He was body pulling everything *(I druid, and our hunter both offered to pull for him)*, and often stood there fighting instead of pulling back, so we got ALL THE MOBS. And he only attacked one mob, so rest went to healer.
---
I ended up moonfire spamming all mobs so first they would break aggro to me instead of healer, and bear escort back any wild mobs to the tank.
---
I got yelled at for wasting the healer's mana by pulling all that aggro.. And I played warr raid offtank in wow classic. It was frustrating as hell
---
It's easy to farm now
---
How does classic run on this? I was thinking about buying a GPD Pocket 2 though I'm kind of waiting for the newer generation models with the 10th gen intel CPU's
---
Can you stop complaining about people complaining like some little bitch☝️
---
well done! whats your /played? im curious how long the average player takes because im far behind at the moment.
---
Wow, top 3 DPS, how does he do it?!
---
nice!
---
Meanwhile they wiped a dozen of time on majordomo and couldn't kill Ragnaros.
---
All of that with the strats perfectly known and with the major boost of 1.12 talents.
---
I guess that would be why, they look at your account's history. I'd say it sucks, but I've seen a dude named "Holocaust" at launch, so I'd be pretty pissed off at this point in Blizzard's shoes.
---
Which one are you looking at?
---
Man, I played vanilla through Wrath pretty religiously and only ever got one epic and a handful of blues out of it. I used to get so frustrated seeing people in guild chat show off the BoE gear that dropped for them lol.
---
I keep 8 slot bags in my bags for when someone helps me or saves my life. Everyone needs bags.
---
"Hardcore" raiding back in ye olden days also involved doing a lot of activities during the week like a job.  They weren't as structured as "run these things for power."  It was more "Go make use of your professions to gather materials and make consumables.  If you're a Hunter, be sure to have enough ammo.  Warlocks, farm your shards."  Stuff like that.  Plenty of farming and crafting.  And if you don't have the best gear you could, go run dungeons for that, too.
---
You could obviously take a less "hardcode" approach and still have fun... but you can do that in modern WoW, too.  Just don't try to run Mythic raids or Mythic+ dungeons.  Problem solved.
---
When you meet a group of grey lowbies you should always leave at least one alive to tell the other faction they should be scared.
---
I felt bad only 1 time about killing a lowbie, just a couple of days ago. I went to Hillsbrad Foothills and the first player I meet is a level 17 Druid in bear form and with ress sickness running on the main road. I thought about it for a good couple of seconds before dotting him once... If he could survive he could live. He didn't.
---
The thought process behind these kinds of names always puzzles me. I mean, I play on RP servers so I have a weird ass standard for names to begin with, but I can never quite get what prompts people to actually name their character like that. Sure, it's fun for a laugh or maybe just a nose-snort, but with such a gigantic host of options and cool names available to you, why on earth would you want your character to be known as something as immature and "joke-gets-old-after-seeing-it-once" like 'Animetiddies'?
---
There isn't much end game.  There are only a couple five man dungeons.  One 10 man I think?  The end game raids are, as we've seen, a joke for the modern gamer.  
---
The vast majority of the content is pre-60.  There are a lot of instances you can do while leveling, or you out level them.  There are no instance boosts for end game.
---
Well, we've got the data now to see what's faster, since there were plenty of people speed running. It looks like this is the speed list:
---
1) Mage AoE grind with layering abuse
---
2) Dungeon cleave farm
---
3) Solo leveling
---
Dungeons have really pulled ahead massively in classic, while on PServers they were seen as being pretty bad XP. This is because PServers were overtuned, so the fights were too hard. Now, with a  good group you can do them several levels earlier, getting more XP, and PServers didn't include the 40% extra dungeon XP that you get.
---
However, it depends heavily on class and comp. Low-downtime classes with strong AoE abilities are really good for dungeons. Priests seem to be the top healers (on horde at least, not sure about pallys), warriors are obviously the main core, shamans are a great support with WF and off heals, warlocks are acceptable due to spirit tap, and feral druids IMO are pretty decent tank puller replacements for warriors. and I've seen rogues be OK if you've got a shaman for WF.
---
If you are just casually strolling through dungeons with tank/hea/3 dps and no further thought put into it, it probably won't be as fast. Still worth doing for sure, especially if you can get the quests out of the way though, just not maximally efficient.
---
Yeah really...  This post is about not rushing, because, "A large chunk of us have more obligations than what we used to, work, kids etc.. You're not alone. No need to let a game affect your mental health when you'll gradually reach the endgame &amp; your goals even if you take your time. Except if you burn out."
---
It takes, what?  4-5 hours to reach level 10 for a normal person?  Even with only 6 level 10s that's 30 hours.  You're not a casual player if you're able to put in 30 hours a week.
---
Grinding is perfectly fine for leveling. Some people find empty areas to be away from others just to grind
---
70g off your mount at 39? Have you been buying all skills/extra gear off the AH? I've been buying random mats I cant farm to lvl up tailoring and I'm at 40g at 36.

A gnome mage in Stonetalon.  Poor Guy got the good ole blink bug and tripped. RIP.
---
Look ok, I've had a rough time. ;)
---
What's the best Hunter spec?  Is there a site I can check out?
---
Why don't you just do your job and keep everyone alive?
---
You could just put all your points into arms and tank with a 2hander
---
People can play however they want to play. If they wanna race to 60, cool! If they wanna take their time also cool. It's a different game to everyone.
---
I'm still level 15...
---
...I'm just enjoying the game!
---
Titan Panel
---
I remember that.  People were getting pretty bored when vanilla had like a year left before BC came out.
---
You are on Reddit commenting about it.
---
Obviously you care
---
Maybe a controversial opinion here, but I like rushing to 60.
---
 It gives me a good thrill leveling fast. ¯\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   But not by doing crazy stuff like aoe farming and such. I just like rushing through quests and killing stuff. 
---
In honesty tho, I plan to level my druid to 60 as fast as I can (considering I get to play like 1-2 hours a day, if I'm lucky and sacrifice some night studying after work haha) And then, once I remember the questing order correctly,  I will try to play an alt more casually and relive the story.
---
Literally OP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZgyM6OAnmg
---
Also you can speed level and afterwards still play another character in a normal pace. It's not an either/or decision
---
This is the most advanced, and most likely accurate guide out there. All data was obtained and tested in the classic beta. [Advanced Shaman leveling guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp-1np_ZDwQ)
---
I got my hunter name Deez.. can you guess my pets name?
---
Im just happy yo interact. low levels i was doing chants for free makin bags etc.. i try to heal people when i can but stam on them really am enjoying it.
---
I highly recommend fishing/cooking/first aid with a warrior.  You’re going to need all three if you’re solo leveling.  It’s time consuming, but it’s that or pay a fortune for food.
---
Don’t worry this guy wud be level 60 if he’d leave a main city
---
Looks like titan panel. I use the twitch client (formally curse)
---
I guess you could feel me then. You probably want to relive the glory of just melting everyone and everything around you in gulch or basin. Maybe even taking 1vs3 or more fights in blackrock mountain. Now you just wont have time to get items which can enable you doing that again.
---
Why do you think you know how I should play the game more than I do?
---
The thing i liked the most in cata and mop was the race to realm first professions. I wasnt worried about being the first to level. But i wanted to be the best at what i did. And on a 90/10 horde to alli server i got RF LW as an alliance player both xpacs. Those stupid internet points and achievements are the only reason i havent switched servers. :/
---
check WillItClassic. I used leatrix, titan panel (the one you noticed), vendor price, and questie.
---
Does anyone know of the Boot Bay Sunday fishing competition has started? Might be my chance to finally win with fewer competitors.
---
Yes, definitely enjoying it a ton. Wish the dungeons were a little more difficult, though I understand they are tuned how they were in vanilla.
---
The build doesn’t come live until you reach level 20. After which you should respec
---
What is already dead, may never die.
---
Because everyone has been rushing for a decade plus, it's old and outdated way to play an mmorpg, plus it's boring af.
---
I'm going glacier slow, reading all the quests, no addons, and when you do this you discover an entire new game in classic, the immersion factor is quite deep, it's nice to discover a zone again, get to know it inside out, have a firm handle on what is happening in that zone and how it affects the world.
---
When anyone wonders why people want to actually experience an mmorpg for a change, we know they are obv running with questie or some other quest addon becasue if they were to actually take their time smell the roses, they wouldn't need to ask, they would know.
---
Ohh haha. I'm sure a lot of people are like this but its awesome that Blizzard is giving everyone a chance to relive this nostalgic game (even if some of us never did before haha)
---
Ugh work is a drag, may shit myself so I can go home.
---
I noticed this as well but unsure if it’s suppose to function as such.
---
Dumb question - how can you check your fps? I can't play on anything higher than 3 (Classic) but I have a decent PC and I think an add-on is causing a lot of stuttering and screen tearing. I'd like to be able to diagnose whether it's an add-on, hardware issue, etc. with something more reliable than my eyes. 
---
I'm thinking I should be able to turn it up to at least 5 on my Ryzen 5 2600/RX580 combo. Or is that unrealistic?
---
I don't disagree with that.  I'm just curious why people seem to need to justify them playing slowly by making a new "why rush??" Post every day. Do they feel threatened by the hardcore rushers??
---
There is no gamble with proper precast cancels.
---
That’s a weakaura
---
you can't

Look at that example, you want to be able to hit all of the abilities on the bottom bar fairly often.
---
Because he can’t heal stupid
---
It's a shaman. Need to move your movement keys to the center of your keyboard, so you can reach pretty much everything. Then bind every key in the keyboard to something.
---
That's still not enough.
---
Couldn't agree more 👍
---
Okay, alright it's i misunderstanding, i thought you said in *classic* The story starts after the cataclysm, you meant retail. My bad.
---
Your healing spells cause a lot of threat.  Especially with large single target heals.  Also there's a range consideration - basically is you're in melee range, you get aggro if you do 10% more threat than the tank.  If you're not in range, you have to do 30% more threat than the tank.  
---
So as a healer, chill back at a little distance, save big burst heals for when the tank had good aggro and you'll be golden.
---
I’ve been slaving away trying to graduate this semester all while getting ready for vacation to watch my brother get married. After that, gotta worry about getting a job lined up. 
---
The lack of play time I’m getting has been making me enjoy it so much more. Level 14 right now and loving every single time I log in. Doesn’t have to be so rushed! :-)
---
My alt is a female NE druid named IllidansWife, so.. I guess I cant say much, my other alt is a Tauren named Manbearpigg

But why? 
---
What is the benefit compared to 10 more levels?
---
Here I was, 15 hours later.  I've been waiting and waiting to pass this banana and nod, but it appears my watch continues.  
---
Finally, oh-my-god-finally.  It's here.  The moment I've been waiting for.  I see my fellow player approaching me in flight.  I grab my banana and prepare my /nod.  As I get ready to trade with my unsuspecting victim, I realize, to my horror, that they kept on going to the next flight path. 
---
Here I wait, it appears my watch continues.
---
I wish I had turned back.
---
Why did I not heed your warning?
---
I am level 32 with 2 days and 18 hours. I wonder if I could reach level 60 at the 5 days mark like you played. Anyone ?
---
If u found this keep on to it for a month and sell for 1k+ gold easy
---
i get where you're coming from lol. but i just dont think its a big deal
---
The biggest surprise for me was that I thought playing on a PvP server meant fighting against alliance players. However, the only real PvP I have had is with fellow horde players ninja-tagging the shit out of key mobs, ninja chests, leaving mid-instance etc. 
---
Also, levelling as a warrior sucks even harder than I thought, which means I am quite some levels lower that my friends (we can not always play together). 
---
I still have fun, but quite some annoyances.
---
Thank you all! :)
---
Questing close to vendors is important generally, especially as a hunter.
---
Fire nova into magma into chain lightning with elemental mastery repeat fire nova and keep mana spring/windfury up at all times.
---
For sure. I mean if you are good at self control questie isnt all that bad. I personally think it can take all the fun out of the game but if you're referencing it every once in awhile who cares IMO. Also you play how you want to play... As long as you are courteous to others it doesn't really affect others anyway. Hell it can even be helpful I'll just follow a questie person sometimes if I'm feeling lazy.
---
&gt;Is it some weird psychological thing where people feel jealous that they can't spend much time playing the game so they feel the need to scream from the rooftops about how slow they are taking it or what??
---
In some cases, you're right on the money.
---
I think that modern game design has a new psychological effect on players (mobile, desktop, and console). There are special weekends, events, daily quests, etc. that are designed to make the player feel "left behind" if they don't participate. For example, Fortnite has short promotions for Marvel movies with exclusive weapons, Super Mario Run does 1.5x coin events, Retail WoW has daily quests that become a chore, Call of Duty has Forth of July lootbox events, and so on.
---
Modern gamers (again just IMO) are conditioned to it. When they see a guild has already cleared Phase 1, their streamers are level 60, and they haven't made it to level 20, they feel completely left behind. Thus, I think that's why we see a lot of posts of people really convincing themselves that its OK to not be where others are.
---
In other cases, I think it is non-conditioned gamers trying to soothe the concerns of others.
---
Hilarious. Def getting reported by someone with purple hair eventually, but hilarious.
---
Bus/taxi &gt; car, because you can get some sleep on the way.
---
no. there would be no retail without vanilla. get your shit straight
---
No, it definitely does.
---
Well it would give me a chuckle the first time I came across it no lie. I just could never play with a name like that.
---
No its just terrible all around. And to save what? 15s or whatever the first respec costs?
---
Leveling as prot is bad all the time in every scenario.
---
I feel like something is definitely different. 
---
Me and a friend were killing the crocs in STV for Singing Crystals and we had about 4-5 crocs spawn at the same spawn point one after the other. As we killed one, it respawned instantly.
---
Somebody wasn't hugged as a child.
---
5.5 hours for level 15? Damn speed racer! Lol I'm at 30 hours played at level 22
---
I apparently pissed off my friend because I'm leveling too slow and because of that she can't level with me. I just want to enjoy the game
---
Well they started it...
---
And enjoying the hell out every single minute ayee? I know i am!
---
I hope they do go into a different direction. 
---
I started hating the game when Wotlk came out, its why i quit, couldn't stand that expansion. but i don't know if it was the content or the systems that were added that did it to me.
---
I hope we can get something like mythics, expanding on dungeons is awesome imo.
---
no need for flying mounts and stuff, keep the world feeling big.
---
give us awesome quests for earning awesome weapons and stuff.
---
i dunno i want the game to expand but i really missed and still love the experience i'm having now. I don't mind having to LFG on my own.  I don't mind long runs for quests, or getting sidetracked. 
---
I want more secrets more reason to explore. 
---
I like skill trees and having to put in work to train. 
---
I dunno  I think they can expand and do it in a different sort of way than before. I think they have a lot of great systems they've added but they tried to change the core of the game, again, imo.
---
it sounds ignorant but to me, it currently has the perfect amount of tedium.
---
Congrats!
---
Yep that's life, we should have appreciated being kids more! I wish I could just spend all day outside playing football (soccer) again too
---
Why do people keep posting this?  It's like they're trying to justify their slow journey to 60 vs a race.  Who cares?  Play how you want.
---
Doubt it. I want flying removed and any lfr function gone.
---
 Bring war back to warcraft. It's 
---
a pipe dream too.
---
Yeah my original goal was 60 by November (average 15-20 hours a week). Then this past week happened.....
---
Deny what you want APES is hero.
---
Anyone else think Shimmering Flats is fucking massive?
---
Stitches would like to have a word with you
---
Classic is very small, less than 10GB i think.  I was able to dl it inside of an hour
---
This is us, except I have herbs and she has skins+mining. We’ll be running somewhere and just split into totally different directions as I yell “plant” and she yells “ore”. =)
---
I just dinged 30! I'm in no rush to reach max, especially with the new PoE season about to start and the Archeage relaunch later this month. I'm totally fine if it takes me months to reach 60.
---
And the the third mana bar is the healers'.
---
Maybe Blizzard just don't like weebs?
---
Then you're that one guy that ends up with aggro, after the tank has to switch targets to get aggro back from aoe spam and loses aggro on the skull.
---
did it on lvl 19, take a boat from Menethil to Theramor, then swim to Ratchet in barrens. Then take a boat to BootyBay
---
Regarding healing-
---
You will need to keep a somewhat separate gear set focusing on +heal, spirit, or mp5.  You'll be OK, but won't be especially great.  So if you have a tank that is in the same boat- maybe undergeared or not a great player, then you'll struggle to sustain through longer pulls.  Or if you have DPS that are pulling threat a lot and taking big damage you won't be able to sustain the team as long as a holy priest with equivalent gear. 
---
DPS in dungeons- better hope there's a mage there!  Spriest need to spam drinks all the time to avoid going OOM.  On boss fights or longer fights you'll have to downrank.  One trick you could try is doing your burst combo when a trash mob is very low HP to try and get the killing blow so you get spirit tap going!
---
We are talking about Classic, not Vanilla.
---
Yeah, if you look it up, there are a good number of stories of people literally dying from overplaying games.  Drink your water and eat your food, people!
---
Again, I don't see the issue with the way your playing.  I'm asking why people seemed to feel threatened by people rushing, and feel the need to make a new post here every day about how real players " take it slow"
---
This filled so much of raid time for me, but I completely forgot about it lol
---
At least that’s what I’m telling myself to feel better about being incredibly slow...
---
&gt;time stop cast macros
---
Can you elaborate on this please? Never heard of it.
---
Are you drinking my mom's soda?
---
You also unlock an extra mana bar with dark pact.
---
some of them were cool. some of them were "you do x% more holy damage." zzzzzzzz
---
Feel free to make your own groups instead of just complaining about how others run theirs
---
I know that this is the Classic WoW subreddit, but jesus, tone down the anti-retail pro-classic circle jerk a little bit.
---
I love how he was opposed to the lfg add on but all he has to do is say "invite me" into his microphone and he has a group ready to carry him.

Right click desktop &gt; NVIDIA Control Panel &gt; Change Resolution.

You want to use the resolution that says "(native)". If you have more than 1 section of resolutions (DSR, Ultra HD etc.) try the highest one in every section and see which gives you higher hz.
---
It's all good I didn't read it as aggressive. Hey man you do you! I just don't like it when others are cancerous.

No no no. 5.5 hours AT level 15. I've got a day and a half total played or something.

Sucks to suck I guess? I usually /roll with any other eligible skinners to skin it, but this was 14 years ago so I dont recall if there were any others present.
---
How did you switch to classic tho? Is it a different link or do you change inside the installer?
---
I’ve gotten like 6 characters to level 10+ because I’m still not sure what I want to play and where I want to play
---
Lmao, oh if you're on Sulfuras you'll always know who we are.
---
You can tell that a ton of boomers play classic by the lack of screenshots.
---
Solution: roll a rogue, take your time leveling solo/ occasional group then at 60 you'll do fine with very little gear as rogues are blatantly OP in most scenarios. Just gotta be good
---
Keybindings!? Don't tell me you're actually a nolifer and a clicker?
---
Server?
---
From what I can tell there are 4 groups of levelers in this game at this point.
---
50+ are the no lifers who aoe farmed dungeons, etc. They also probably only slept 4-5 hours a night since release. Maybe a few hunters who used speed leveling guides.
---
40-50 are the no lifers who played a bunch but quested and did dungeons more normally. They probably also got a normal nights sleep. They will hit 60 in the next week.
---
25-40 are those who took the week off, played a ton but also helped out guildies. Did most quests not just the optimal ones, ran dungeons for gear pieces they wanted, etc. They will be 60 in the next few weeks depending on how RL catches back up with them.
---
1-25 are the normal people. Those who want to play but have jobs and responsibilities they couldn't ignore. Those who are taking their time, enjoying the world and exploring. They will be 60 in October if ever
---
&gt;All actions short of violence and targeted harassment done in-character are a byproduct of what his audience is demanding from him.
---
The problem being there has been targeted harassment that's been caused by him, and all of his crappy in game antics done in the name of "HIS PERSONA!" have real world impacts on the other people playing. He's in a play with thousands of other performers, but is the only one acting. But please, do continue to go off.
---
Its almost like the game is having trouble with mouse polling rates. I posted a link to what I'm experiencing, its hard to see. But I'm moving the mouse as smoothly as possible.
---
Every time I get a world epic drop it's Helm of Narv or Hammer of the Northern Wind or some crap. Never a good one like this. Grats man.
---
Holy shot dude, you really can't accept that people enjoy different things?
---
Do you have self esteem issues? You keep trying to insult people who play differently than you.
---
Ah yeah nothing as immersing as seeing a realistic name floating above the head of a character.
---
Seems overly sensitive to me, but on an NA server, it makes more sense I guess.
---
In these low level dungeons there is as good as no AoE. The locks should not die if they play correctly. Aka. Dont pull stupid aggro and regen life via bandages.
---
How does leveling work with friends and xp scaling? If I'm level 30 and they are level 15 do they get any xp? Can we do anything together to level?
---
The only bit I raced was to get to level 30 where I was with my priest on a private server before launch, now I'm taking my time, doing breaks from the guide I'm using for my professions and then carrying on where I left off, it's a great balance, I'm happy to do one or two levels whenever I'm logged on, the best memories are from your levelling experience!
---
The hero we need but dont deserve.

Had the volume on mute, but did the theme song in my head while the clip was playing.
---
Fair surprise when I turned the sound up for my second viewing :)
---
Hey bud,
---
I've got a clan of about 20ish people currently, we are all in the levelling process and making our way up to max level to engage is pvp and maybe raid content if we get the numbers. We are on Razergore and are welcoming all chill players, feel free to DM me for details.
---
It's even worse for undead. They're six feet under.
---
Just do a hybrid and play how you want to. Do a combo of Ret talents and the key holy talents.
---
that's just a personnal opinion, but still, GW2 is able to pull expansions without any level incrase and it's still a total blast even for max-geared characters
---
My mage in retail has twice been named Digbickjaina, and has twice been force changed lol.

Just bookmarking

Come to Gandling, we have cookies (and no queues)

If you're trying to do the Onyxia questline, yes, he's in Outland. If you're just wandering around Desolace questing, no, he's all over the place.

I took these screenshots only a few days ago:

Both were taken when at night. As you can see, it's not necessarily the world that is darker, but the way your character reacts to lighting. In classic, standing in the shadows of something makes your toon look a lot darker compared to retail. If you run through patches of light and dark (eg. in a forest), your character lighting changes often and dynamically, and since you focus on your character the most, the world seems darker.
---
It doesnt? 
---
Also, you ‘quit’ for 2 weeks and come back then when there are no more queues..?
---
 Welcome to my life in 2004 / 2005.  All my friends zoom to 60, but I have 2 kids in diapers and can play maybe 4 hours a week.  
---
  I may get Classic and see if I can ding 60 faster than back then.  Kids are in high school, and could care less about my old games.
---
Yea

[Now #3 among major MMO subs](https://mmo-population.com/detailed), ahead of FFXIV and ESO, trailing only OSRS and /r/wow.
---
I think QoL changes need to be extremely conservative because they can butterfly effect and have unintended consequences. Showing HP seems benign enough, but moving mounts out of your bags has the potential to impact bag crafters, cause people to pick up more loot in dungeons, and cause inflation of server economies over the long run. These consequences may seem negligible at first, but if everyone is able to pick up 10% more loot per run for the span of a few years it can cause inflation. That's just an example, there may be more. I'm not saying QoL changes shouldn't happen, but they need to be very considered and conservative.
---
Unlikely the raid group will allow you to take a debuff spot for rupture tho
---
Yeah idk what to tell you.  Not like imma edit it to make it real-er.
---
Some are hitting 60, some are hitting 40 and getting their mounts, some are finally braving the wilds of STV.. here I am, level 17, AFK in Loch Modan, obsessively tweaking my UI.
---
Yea i was a dps/off healer in Deadmines and the other priest, main heals, told me not to shield the bear tank because of the rage and it was an epiphany for me. Glad i learned that early on and not in a raid lul
---
It was really just meant to be a funny.
---
Lol nerd
---
I'm really enjoying the ride, I just wish it was easier to queue into the game at night time. Especially now that they shortened AFK I can't even get in early safely anymore =[
---
Not yet.
---
Wtf?? Source?
---
Excellent dwarf face, definitely hide the helm on this one
---
*alt tabs to spreadsheet* its 2019 lol
---
STV makes me want to stop every time I level a toon
---
You’ll probably want to do some sort of ret spec for levelling, then change to holy at 60.   To heal most dungeons you can get by with some healing type gear.
---
Mocking Blow!!
---
*Miss*
---
^^Fuk
---
Honestly fuck max level and fuck quest helper and other game altering things like that. Fuck AOE Farming fuck grinding dungeons only, why are you playing classic if you are going to do the same thing you would do in retail. These are the same people who are going to want more content changes and content added.
---
If you like Welfare WoW go play it.  Do all of us and our queue waits a favor.
---
If it was a thing (I played Vanilla), it wasn’t common or at least not on my server. If you’re only running it as 5 man, I would run Lock/Mage/Mage/Paladin or Shaman/Priest. Sham would be good for totem or pally for consecration.
---
Racing to 60 seems like an awful idea when there’s no expansion in the future. You’re just going to do end game content, get bored, and quit.
---
That guy in the corner with both his monitors is me at all the LAN parties my buddies and i have😂
---
&gt; First you get 60 - then you'll have loads to do at first.
---
Like? If you have a raid you don't even have to do much 60 dungeon grinding.
---
Getting all the BiS gear in classic is a pretty tall order in and of itself.
---
Sell mats buy bags, ez
---
Hit level 30, taking a break to level professions. :)
---
Glad to read these sorts of posts. I catch myself orienting certain parts of my day around whether I’ll get to log onto classic. I was going to skip my pickup basketball run tonight after work just to get a few hours in. WoW will still be there tomorrow.
---
Yes! Exactly this i was 18 first time i played  end of nilla/ start of BC...Im really enjoying the grind. Reading the quests getting the lore. Stopping and fishing to see what i can catch.. heal9ng folks that are about to die.. thow in a res sp they dont have a long walk.  TRADING! I love trading fuck the AH ill give you a bag you gice me the mats! 
---
this has been a great experience so far.. like to thank each one of you glorious bastards!.. Lok'tar!
---
I'm always amazed to see this, I don't understand how people get to play like this in groups. Me and my sister playing together is a struggle with 6 hours queues. Last saturday we waited 6 hour for a queue, i got in, she got disconnected while away from computer and when she got back, she was put again at the back of the queue, another 6 hours. We got to play at around 12 am but only for half an hour because she was tired and so was I.

I was actually just making bags for people in StormWind (silk and woolen) when a lowbie asked if I could make him a linen one. He only had the linen so I just decided to be nice and throw in the extra thread I had and make him the bag. I then remembered I had an extra woolen bad that I gave to him, then my boyfriend came over and have him another.
---
He was very thankful and that made us both feel really good 
---
Also, making [Small Silk Pack][Woolen Bag] free in SW with your mats, tips appreciated! ;)
---
I have never seen balanced world pvp on any server except from the first 5-6 months of classic. 
---
You pick a server, if it favors your faction (usually horde) you are good. Otherwise you keep getting killed every time opposite faction outnumbers you or your group. It is not fun. I would not worry about it. 
---
There may be exceptions but pvp on pvp realms is all about one side zerging other with superior numbers.

Tis the season for unemployment.
---
They do it for easy karma farming.
---
you don't have to try in classic
---
Yeah if you’re getting xp it’s okay but really it’s just like the guy above me said, leveling is more efficient because you can farm better later on in levels.
---
Welp, I have a 7 hour window in which to play, minus 5 hour queues, giving up on a couple of days, I made it to 8.

A group of relatively high level elite mobs that patrol a large area in the middle of The Barrens.

I've started three alts with three different peeps waiting for some of my friend group to get on at the same time to run RFC.  I finally ran it on one of my characters yesterday.
---
Meh.
---
I can deal with chain pulling as long as you let me drink mana while your being whailed on lol. It’s the ones that keep me in combat and then whine about me having to drink because I’m on fumes are the problem.
---
I think its hilarious.  I'm mostly playing the game for lolz and good times with old buddies.
---
I voted in a way to poison your data but I'm not saying how hehhehehjehejejhejejhheheehehehehehhehehehhehhehehehhehehhehehheh
---
My real rush was reaching 40 in 1 week and getting the mount, which I did. Now I feel way more relaxed, I can finally casually make money, afford all the spells I missed, buy shit, explore the world and do some dungeons without trying to zerg them.
---
But I admit, the initial rush was kinda pog. Knowing that you're one of the very first out there, in these un(ex)plored lands.
---
zyclognome-b
---
I think the twitch Addons call it wow2
---
He doesnt he is just letting others who feel the need to rush because there friends are or guild is that you can chill out if you want too.

Level 9 crew
---
&gt; His response: "I'm trying to go fast I want to get to level 20 sorry". Ahh yes that's right it's all about you... Screw my experience
---
Do you not see at least a little irony here?
---
no one asked.
---
There is already plans Friday for classic wow to release burning crusade expansion down the road
---
It felt like one character was conscious at a time and it was easy to exploit one when I would psychic scream them, pouncing on one at a time.
---
It’s a scarlet 2i2 audio interface. It just makes it to where I can use an XLR microphone to talk to people through discord basically.
---
I think druids benefit a lot from macros to help facilitate changing forms to use different abilities. For example, to toss a heal when you're in form, you need to drop form first, then heal. You can instead macro it like so, which will just drop the form for you, and then cast the spell. I find it's a bit smoother to play when I don't have to manually drop form though. 
---
/cancelform  
---
/cast Spell Name
---
I also quite like powershifting macros, which will simply shift to the form you're already in, which is useful to break snares, or to proc furor. You'll probably want an addon to show your mana while in form, just so you don't run too low, which is easy to do. 
---
You can search for examples of what other people have done for their druid macros, to help give you an idea of what's possible. And you can either copy them directly as is, or modify them to suit your needs. 
---
Perhaps my favorite spec in all of classic is the 0/30/21 druid spec, which is a tanking AND healing spec. You can literally swap gear and switch between being a viable tank, or a viable healer, without having to respec all the time. I also quite like that I get to collect multiple gear sets on my druids, as collecting gear is a big part of the fun of playing a class, and I find it fun to have multiple sets to work on at the same time.
---
Especially with the long queues, nice work
---
Don't worry I'm very aware of it.
---
Depends on GM nationality.
---
Yeah maybe restricting it to your server could be a good thing, didn't think about that!
---
The Tauren killed in the middle of the road with the head in the grass make this screenshot 10 times better
---
Thanks mate!  Yup friends are trying to keep up :). We also have a shaman so they really feel it heh
---
Because every roll requires people to be responsible with their resources, a lock pulling extra mana from a healer instead of the tank or someone who actually pulls aggro/extra adds means a possible wipe.  Being dps doesn't mean you burn through all of your mana and cool downs to be top of the charts, it's making sure you can deal that damage without hindering the group.
---
I’d like to see them progressively open up new servers with each new expansion. Then have the option to copy your level 60 on classic over to the tbc server for example. Then you can progress past classic and still do classic content when you want.
---
The option to send it back is 99% incase the price set by sender is wrong.
---
If you agree on a sale via CoD and chicken out, you're simple a horrible person.
---
&gt;clicks on post he doesn't want to see
---
&gt;complains
---
Genius.
---
The 5 mans i’m Talking about are SM aoe runs where the lock is in the middle of 20 people spamming lifetap and the self-immolation spell. Hard to tell if they suddenly started getting hit or if it’s just their self damage
---
Yeah I don't care but I see his point feeling like it's a race. It's hard to tunnel vision on your priorities even when it's quiet
---
I will not rest until every main, alt, and bank alt on Kromkrush has a Linen Bag made by Kididdles.
---
are you on a low pop server?  that shit is almost always crowded.
---
thats Quartz for the cast bars. He also has titanpanel up top.
---
I’ve had this happening all week though it isn’t a one off
---
I’m a really bad altaholic. I get immersed in my class fantasy then I see someone else and I’m like “ohh THATS what I want to do” or I imagine end game with diff classes and scenarios and now I have 4 toons level 15+
---
I have been spamming since release, like pretty much as soon as i am done with making dinner or taking care of chores around the house, my gf says she will break up with me if i start to look like a wow player
---
The game has always been the adventure and exploration getting to 60, that is where a lot of the in game friendships people made in classic were born 
---
There is nothing more fun than crawling through all of the level appropriate dungeons 
---
Don’t race - and remember, almost more time was spent developing the robust lore filled world than the handful of boss fights that you’re tempted to race to and beat
---
Yeah I've been having this issue too and tried to turn mouse sensitivity and camera follow down but every so often it still jumps.  I'll try this when I get home.
---
This. There was a group of that had a specific server picked out to play on. Some of us got in, some of us didn't. Now we still have a hard time playing together. So now, we fight queue times and very seldom get to play together because of it. I love the free server transfer idea. That would have been a lot easier for us to convince those that got into the server to switch like some of us had to do.
---
Don't heal me I'm tapping but I 100% intend to hit myself with the healthstone and I hate using my healthstone then getting  hit with a heal its a waste
---
It's a bigger problem than the spam and ruins the experience for other players in a multitude of ways. It's clearly not going to faze you in any way, since like most gold buyers, your sense of entitlement eclipses all reason, so it's a waste of time trying to argue.
---
I started in 2004 in PVP realm.  Never again.  I spent so much time corpse hopping and being camped.  Had to leave whole zones because ganking was so bad.  Had to just log off and do something else.
---
Such a waste of time.  Only reason we rolled PVP was because world PVP was all there was. No such thing as BGs.  But now we know better.
---
A few of my guildies grinded 10 man SM for 16 hours in one day. That sounds so miserable. They missed so many cool zones to quest in. 
---
I pretty much do all the quests I can and do each dungeon once. I've done all the dungeons a billion times leveling in the past. 
---
Just got with Thousand Needles outside of the salt flats. Great zone
---
Wait... on Faerlina?
---
You are. You'll move to Hillsbrad next. Don't worry tho, quest line will bring you there
---
I hopped in last night for the first time to grab my water totem stuff from TM. I picked an herb as an unfriendly Alli came up to me. I popped ghost wolf and almost ran straight into a gaggle of alliance. I almost had a very bad evening!
---
Go to Westfall down by the lighthouse and swim south along the coast. You'll end up in STV, and you'll avoid 90% off mobs and about 99% of horde. I swam to booty bay from Westfall and didn't see any horde.
---
I know... why the fuck do I struggle?
---
As an aside, you or others will need to help her level.
---
Level to around 15 in silver pine and go to barrens
---
Someone is a lot closer to their mount money
---
I also play stoned... I wasted about an hour leveling yesterday because I got East and West mixed up lol
---
And *I* say again, I usually /roll with other skinners to see who gets to skin it.  
---
It was 14 years ago and I dont recall if there was another (although its unlikely, by then most people switch out of skinning which is why that hide is worth so much).
---
I main'd a rogue in vanilla and I planned my energy ticks constantly. I was *never* short. This definitely wasn't in vanilla.
---
One of the most common complaints about BFA is how the classes have been dumbed down and rotations have been simplified
---
It was definitely WoD.
---
I literally have skull mark on a macro so I can update what thing to hit throughout the fight. Important because the thing the dps need to be hitting is often not the thing I'm targeting as a tank, due to needing to spread sunders to keep mobs  off the healer.
---
I guess technically speaking you could say its a world drop, but people generally only refer to epics and a few rares as world drops as a way to say "hey this item is super rare and the only way to get it is killing mobs and being lucky"
---
pet battle, would be the only thing for me
---
I thought it was you have to level them once, and it's a roll of the dice if they know anything. Not positive tho.
---
Pick a lower pop server fam
---
Makes your own choices. Don’t be a sheep.
---
Married.... moving away...? What losers. Can't believe they chose that garbage over rolling alts.
---
would like to know aswell
---
I feel it's important to note they didn't nerf the 10 man dungeon xp, it was a bug fix. Just don't want to give the idea to people that blizzard didn't like this way of playing so they 'fixed it' so maybe they could 'nerf/buff' other things.  This was a fix in line with vanilla
---
To me, your bis should be fair game for rolls. As long as you explain your intent at the beginning of a run, many will be accept it and say good luck.
---
Also most people don't realize the next patch phase doesn't start for a long time. More than enough time to hit 60.
---
If the tank only aggro the first mob, you will get heal aggro from the adds
---
It should be illegal for wow feeds to come up in popular.
---
I was addicted to this shit once, I don’t want to see it anymore...
---
You, the hunter, are able to learn pet skills when pets you tame use them. If the bird you tamed has the skill, but is not high enough level to use it, then yes, you'll have to level it. The pet has to use the skill for you to learn it.
---
Some skills (Growl, Natural Armor, Natural Stamina, and elemental resistances) are trained at a Pet Trainer, located near Hunter Trainers.
---
Once you've learned a skill, you're able to teach that skill to the pet (up to its max skill points) via the Beast Training (iirc) skill in the general tab of your spellbook.
---
toss anything of low value, stack the best and stay out as long as possible.
---
Alt will be option key, everything is basically the same.
---
Save those elemental earth.  They are going to be worth 8-10g each in the weeks leading up to AQ40 release.
---
Sure, but every melee wants an up to date weapon for leveling. Ravager would be great for enhance shamans, even better if the ravager proc can proc windfury (no idea if it can)
---
I can tell you mine. I have everything maxed out/all sliders up.
---
Ryzen 2600x
---
GTX 1060 6GB
---
16gb 2666 mhz RAM
---
Have it stored on an SSD
---
Playing 1080p
---
I honestly just have vsync on and haven't uncapped it to see what I get, but I haven't had any FPS drops whatsoever. Even had probably a 60/70 ally v 70 horde raid in Redridge and no FPS drops with that either.
---
To throw in mu anecdotal experience, ive group with a stranger in almost every session on my druid on US bigglesworth.
---
Ive yet to see any mentions for caster/melee cleave for dungeons, if a limit is put it's usually levels or a mention of meme specs (like once).
---
The communication that you dont consider communication is fertile ground for organic communication imo.
---
Me too! An undead gave me a green bow. Made me so happy!
---
Animetiddies, super egregious, I know.
---
I really thought it would be a weekend experience for me and then hop back onto retail. I did just that, and then felt the literal pointlessness of retail and I'm all in on classic. Looking forward to the future of this game and how blizzy handles it.
---
I did the same thing, reached level 40 and bought my mount instantly. Felt so good to conquer what was such a daunting pain to me as a kid, in such a short time.
---
Ah, probably no inspections there.
---
it really is great. i played hunter back in vanilla and now get the chance to do it again. have no idea why this isn't in retail
---
&gt;I mean, if this is a mage, he shouldn't have died. I frequently do this because I can slow everyone down while doing top DPS. In fact, my healer loves it because he basically doesn't have to heal the tank. When the mobs get near me, I just frost nova and blink away, starting blizzard spam all over again.
---
You can get people killed if you arent careful.
---
If you root a melee pack while you have threat and move out of range they will hit whatever is nearest to them.
---
Barely anyone understands this and blames the tank.
---
I'm taking my time and loving it! I would have loved to rush, but I'm currently playing mostly alone so I decided to focus doing it on my pace. Doing instances and professions. 
---
My wife also got in to WoW so I'm doing few hours a week teaching her! She's also enjoying the journey so far.
---
I've seen so many people talk about this, but I have literally never had that experience. I think you are only too broke to train if you spend large sums of money on the AH for gear or crafting materials.
---
I'm not against add-ons but I really don't want any quest helpers. If I'm struggling I'll ask other people. If it really is that impossible I'll check wowhead but I haven't had to do that at all yet.
---
That's how it was.  In vanilla I often had to just stop playing because whole zones were being camped by one side.  World PVP was awful to level up with.
---
This
---
Leveled as elemental too!
---
Nice job.
---
not sorry
---
But if you become a gold farmer then your work becomes the grind
---
If they complain that you heal as a shadow priest while leveling they don't know anything. I'm now lvl 50 on my shadow priest and I have been able to heal all dungeons so far. When I got to ZF I started to feel the lack of mana and efficiency but it's 100% doable if you and your party knows what you're doing.
---
My favorite is classic castbars for enemy cast bar and timers
---
Interested on the buff timers, mine is weird
---
I feel kind of bad. Levelling a couple of alts with four woolen bags I've had people randomly open trade and give me linen bags.
---
I just say thank you so much, then quietly vendor them.
---
Wait are you saying falcorn or animetiddies sounds childish? Because...
---
Pick pocket usually takes long enough for the tank to get threat :)
---
Tried to respec last night.
---
First respec is 1 gold.  That's a lot early on.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18510/hide-of-the-wild
---
Only one I know of, but its BoE and can be bought from AH.
---
Or dwarfly, if you swing that way
---
Upvote for visibility this is a huge issue. Those of us that main or main'd a rogue will know how significant this is.
---
It's probably a consequence of them taking the new energy system from live and trying to adapt it to the old system instead of just re-implementing the old system.
---
Then you've noticed warriors who aren't really tanks but want no wait time for dungeons.
---
Is there a daily need for a "enjoy the game" or "take your time!" Thread in here or something?
---
We get it, you're slow at leveling.
---
My dude using a whole ass ultrawide monitor turned sideways just to display the Alliance flag.
---
at least you're self-aware enough to realise that it IS the sense of humor of a 13-year-old boy.
---
Problem is accessing SHIFT and CTRL in your setup, tbh... I reckon you go from like 12 easily accessible keybinds (QSERFVCXZ123) to 16 (AQWDRTGBVCXZ2345), but it's much harder to reach modifiers.
---
Not a fan.
---
Grats! I've been looking forward to farming one of these guys since I started classic. I farmed for 12 hours back in the day to get one for me and one for my (at the time) boyfriend. He was my favourite pet.
---
Thats because eveeyone will hit these raids asap get geared up and bassically control the raiding scene for your server. Get geared fast bro or youll be left in the dust like i was in vanilla. Man do i wish i could play with you all though, truthfully it would most likely bring back memories of my grandma so most likely i wouldn't be able to handle it anyways.
---
Warrior is a pain in Vanilla, but it's worth it in the end.
---
Can't wait to chew on gnomes and elves for breakfast...
---
/r/nothingeverhappens
---
Fuck paying for power leveling.
---
Yea no offence intended, but if you agree to a CoD and not follow through, you're trash.
---
People drag mobs to Crossroads all the time. Or Locks release thier big demon.
---
Are you really promoting power leveling on this subreddit? This will go well
---
Its just boring. The only thing that will kill you is boredom.
---
I got banned in BC for arena names. I was like 14 at the time but:
---
I was born without a weiner
---
I drink my own pee
---
I finger my sisters butthole
---
We each were leaders of a different one and all got 3 day bans. :/
---
So very much this!
---
Barely even level 12 lol
---
Are you on a PvE server by chance? I could imagine leveling being extremely dull without world PvP
---
Thats not really edgy just funny lol
---
Outlands was far from a bad experience for leveling a warrior.
---
Over the holiday weekend a buddy leveled 3 characters to 20. This is my first time playing WoW and my first character, a mage, is halfway thorough 19. And I'm ok with that.
---
It would be nice if I could have both open simultaneously. That would give me something to do while waiting in the queue for classic. Not sure why they disabled that capability.
---
k
---
Sometimes after the fourth or fifth "That name is unavailable" message some people just start typing in weird stuff to see if it works.
---
Dual specs, most updates from TBC tbh.
---
Mad downvoters :D he had 300k viewers, yeah sure nobody cares about him
---
Haha. I'm still level 20 and I'm planning on hitting 30 this weekend. So I foresee quite a lot of corpse running this weekend.
---
&gt;I'm currently 35 and i have not touches STV, arathi, Dust marsh or Badlands
---
Those zones are usually 35-45? With the exception of arathi, which is pretty skippable IMO since there's already shimmering flats and desolace, plus SM runs are easy and quick.
---
You have mischaracterized the healer's job.
---
The healer's job is to keep everyone alive. Period. This is what's best for the group. Whether the damage is avoidable or not is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is keeping people alive.
---
If the person is being so wild that they can't be kept alive, then yeah, replace them. But as long as everyone can be kept alive without too big a strain, and their play is maximizing their DPS and minimizing the length of time kept in the dungeon, then that is what I would call a smooth run.
---
It is a very small matter for a DPS to have aggro on a mob in a low level dungeon. With the way warrior aoe threat is, it's practically unavoidable. 
---
I suggest that people calm down and press their buttons and do their job and not overreact with statements like "Looks like you wont get any heals for the rest of the dungeon." That's a very self-important and unhelpful way to play the game.
---
Because you don’t want to play the game besides what is actually readily prepared for you. Do you only Plan on doing MC/Ony once? 
---
Also I don‘t even know how much time you have to play. If you play 12-14hours a day then content will probably be gone rather soon.
---
But farming consumables, farming gold for enchants, doing all the quests, doing dungeon runs for BIS items until later raids come out and
---
leveling professions you should have plenty to do until BG‘s come out.
---
By then World Bosses and BWL will be out too. Even more content. 
---
May even farm rep with Darkmoon faire which is out by then. 
---
While still doing consumables farming and PVP.
---
If you refuse to do most of that content then even with 3-4 hrs a day you will probably run out of content really quick :P 
---
That is a lot of content - for me it is enough and I play 3-4hrs and 6-7 on the weekends usually when I can.
---
And if it isn’t then I will start leveling an alt.
---
I like the game and always find content. If you can’t find any more content then you have to go play something else in the meantime
---
Everything has been tried!
---
I specifically played something I haven't before so it didn't feel lacking. But it sounds like you won't like classic either way. If all you are in it for is raiding then classic will be boring.
---
Is there a good step by step leveling guide (Alliance)? I do take my time reading the quest lore and all that, but I just want a more efficient route. I totally forgot about hard stops in zones like duskwood and whatnot where the quests jump from level 23 to 30 to 35. I'm currently a level 31 Paladin and leveling is slow enough as it is
---
Please send help, I just dinged 30 and have 5g. What are you doing to have so much gold at that level?
---
i feel like that’s a rare occurrence
---
Aight. See ya in a few months
---
Not necessarily time travel. But an "alternate timeline" so whatever they do it can be just credited to "well it's from a timeline where that is the truth". Which also makes the entirety of the lore meaningless, as every major villain could just be alive and more powerful in the other timelines. There is now an infinite amount of Lichkings, Deathwings and Burning Legions out there. Canoninally.
---
**YES!!!**
---
I am more looking forward to grinding in Hillsbrad than my slo pitch playoff game tonight.
---
How do I set up the default blizzard raid frames instead of the party frames? I keep seeing them in screenshots but I can’t figure out how to enable them in game. Thanks!
---
If you took out 4 guys before they got you, the sound incredibly incompetent.
---
I don’t play WoW but this thread was suggested to me on my home page. I feel this exact way about most any multiplayer game. I put 40 hours into The Division 2 over a 2 month period and only got to level 22 (max is 30). I let my brother borrow it and he’s max level in 3 days. 
---
People who want to be the absolute best at everything they do need to take a step back and realize that’s not what it’s all about, especially when it comes to games. Video games are supposed to be a source of entertainment, not something that will stress us out. It’s intended to be a stress reliever, not a stress giver. To those who are playing Classic WoW, take your time with it, whether it’s your first time or you’re returning. Have fun with the game and try not to let it stress you out. Memories are best made when you have the chance to stop, look around and fully experience the world at your own pace.
---
Have fun everyone :)
---
Maybe stop being so easily offended?
---
This ain’t shit compared to what swampletics is and had to go through in OSRS.  But to be fair you can’t get that hardcore in classic.
---
Yep.  13 is low, 14 is better, 15 is just right.  You gain so much power in those lower levels just from leveling up that it's worth it to just wait another level or two to go.  I do all the dungeons nearing the end of the level bracket so that I have an easier time of them.

I was in a guild for like an hour and it told everyone to join discord where they dictated the timeframe they expected everyone to get to 20, 30 etc.  /gquit
---
I'm enjoying the content, the end game stuff isn't going anywhere.  Reading the quests, finding things I've never seen before on my walks, interacting with other players instead of them just existing.
---
To each their own but I'm not in a rush
---
I can't fathom how this small of a stat could really matter. 2 of every 100 hits, by definition, will miss. Is it really that much?
---
Shaman hunter and the lock were hilarious lol.
---
Only when asked
---
Nice. Are you going for the spirit=spell power thing too?
---
By posting it you realize people are going to report it now...
---
Drop rates on database sites are not exact. They are fed data by people who choose to upload data to the database.
---
Well from this extensive list of comments we should expect our reportings and grow up. Childish behaviour in a game not inteded for children shall not be tolerated.
---
They hate playing against/with streamers who basically can beg for items/gold and get them. A streamer gets mad at you and they could blueball you from raiding until you swap servers.
---
Falcorn is childish too
---
i spent a lot of yesterday just helping out old friends and new in SFK, love this instance, for me its about seeing the instances back as they were before they were added looking forward to getting to RFK/SM/Scholo but am taking my time getting there, also helped that im a tank so my guild loves me when they need to run a dungeon
---
I wonder how many people are going to race to 60 and then bitch about how it's taking too long to get geared raid groups together.
---
At least dingin 60 is so much faster than getting that sweet financial independence.
---
Well, a lvl 60 character that finished BC and WOLTL certainly deserve a hearstone with a 30 min cooldown or a 15% better travel speed. I don't think it will break the game, but make it more bearable for them to still travel in those olds areas.
---
Also, another idea could implant high-level areas in all regions (except the noob zone), so the endgame characters aren't forced to be in the exact same place but have reasons to farm/kill shit in their favorite area, making the old continent more frequented.
---
To be fair, my friend named his character "Ok" and laughs every time. He gets whispers all the time. It's confusing as fuck, but hopefully blizzard doesn't come down on him, because it makes for a lot of great "Who's on first" conversations.
---
Yeah, I do 2-3 hours of questing. 1 hour of milling around town,  sitting on the AH etc. Weekends are a different story though.
---
No time, gotta work and path of exile is coming out again on Friday.
---
Also undead use Will of the Forsaken!! It’s a 2 minute Holy Shit button and will ensure you don’t run into other mobs in a dungeon. Yeah the priest can dispel, but at low levels we have long ass heals that really are better used on the tank and not cut off because you’re flying in fear toward a bunch of other shit in the dungeon.
---
Because this sub is full of gatekeeping dickbags like OP. “PLAY THE GAME HOW I WANT YOU TO PLAY IT!!”
---
Thank you for informing us priests. My dad made sure I knew this before I touched a dungeon but it's good that more will know.
---
&gt;Problem is accessing SHIFT and CTRL in your setup, tbh
---
How are you resting your pinky finger when you're on WADS? Maybe it’s just me, but I've always rested mine on the shift key so moving my hand over one key would leave my pinky still on the shift key and a slightly bigger left/down movement to hit CTRL.
---
Using a guide based on my play style and what skills to use based on how to play the game, using add ons such as questie for qol and efficiency. What aggro is and how to pull mobs and strafing between weapon cool down for swings
---
Agi on wars is very strong. I love agi/str pieces in particular. Greedy guy but eh.
---
That too lol. Understandable though because it's a brez.
---
My monitor's refresh is 165. Why 3 fps under?
---
Thanks, honestly i think i might be alright as well.
---
shh
---
Just because it was a minor inconvenience doesn't mean he wasn't a dick.
---
I mean, I used a ton of WoWhead when I was leveling in vanilla. I don't really see this as that different. Rather than having to alt tab and search up quest details online, I can just use my UI and keep the experience going.
---
It was already changed to something else and I don't play retail anymore.
---
Am I 60 if I have 6 level 10's?
---
It's possible to do it but I'm too lazy to prove it rn
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Cool thread
---
I'm curious, what is your /playtime? I'm about 3 hours in at lvl 9. I'm a casual player though. I don't have time to sit and play for very long on any given day.
---
Paladin question.
---
For dungeons am I wanted as a healer? If not what spec would allow for the best dungeon experience?I’m thinking of the best ways to level and it seems I could always grind as ret but I’d like to get some dungeons done too.
---
jokes on you, I have a gsync monitor so its ALWAYS at my monitor refresh rate
---
I dropped $1250 on a new laptop this weekend specifically to play WoW Classic so I will play the way that I want - which is to say I needed a multipurpose laptop in my semi for both gaming and editing dashcam videos so I'll be one of the filthy casuals that isnt in a rush to get to 60. Matter of fact, I'll be shocked if I get to any endgame content by the end of the year.
---
This is actually my problem- because the warlocks I seem to end up grouping with lifetap 6 times in a row very quickly. So I see their health DROP out of the corner of my eye, rush to shield&amp;heal, and the tank thinks they lost aggro and its confusing. If locks were more gradual with it, it wouldn't cause as much panic.
---
I just gotta get used to ignoring the warlock's HP (which goes against every healer instinct I have, but oh well). But yeah, space out your lifetaps if you can!
---
I would have noped out of there
---
I have a high refresh monitor and the horsepower to drive it but wow is the last game that needs it. I limit at 60 to keep my room from heating up.  Maybe in the winter I'll unleash the space heater level performance.
---
Hmm plate with agility on it.
---
This looks like an absolute blast, really wish i would have prepared better took a couple nights off to do this exact thing for classic.
---
But they Do....far north right next to the pass to duskwood is a flypoint...
---
I'm pretty lucky. I have a job that while on weekends and back shift I can play on my laptop. I raided a majority of the last few expansions from work.
---
In true vanilla style I joined the first guild that invited me and it’s called ‘classic’.
---
It will suffice
---
You can only play classic for so long before it gets stake
---
Grind in Desolace.  Lots of good vendor drops from basilisks, hyenas, and thunder lizards.  Not as good (but still decent) from swoops.  Save all your mystery meat and cook carrion surprise, vendor it for good cash.  (https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15863/carrion-surprise)
---
I loved Deso on private servers cuz it's not exactly a super popular questing hub and there are large areas of the zone where no one goes for anything, but these same areas have a ton of mobs and high density.
---
I feel like Shamans don't get enough pity for having to carry around 4 totems. I would bet most Warlocks carry less than 4 soul shards at any given time.
---
&gt;Solo target mage leveling build
---
&gt;UGH it's so tedious!
---
Yeah dude, no shit
---
Same. My body actually hurts from abusing my self playing for 8 hours a day since launch. I was happy to go back to work.
---
I got a sweet Main Hand sword called Wingblade from some quest right around lvl 20, and already had a good other green one-hand so those have been doung really well. So while it certainly may not be the best min/max option, I enjoy the speed/playstyle of it much more. Though I wish there were more hit stats on lower level gear. I chased a fleeing human in Hillsbrad last night and missed 5 times in a row swinging at the back of his head lmao.
---
I always found the middle leveling run to be the hardest to get through (roughly about mid 20’s to mid 40s).
---
You are out of the brand new character mindset but no where near hitting max level. Dungeon runs aren’t as crazy any more as while everyone is excited to do that first dungeon they then calm down and it gets harder to find groups as people split between leveling zones.
---
But towards the end, people kinda rejoin together and get excited about getting that max level again. But many people level alts for a good reason.
---
Lay on hands on cooldown, sounds about right.
---
I managed to make it from 19-24 and hit the Darkshire area.  Only saw one Horde mage, and he got me once...  
---
Well, I bubbled with 33 health and no mana (was fighting mobs) and then a spider hit me after the bubble faded. So, I don't count that as him \*really\* getting me.
---
Edgy. There's no way there's two other commenters saying the same thing.
---
There won't be any prot warriors that still wear these boots after they start raiding.  Bear tanks will use warden staff until at least AQ40.  It's worth a crap ton.
---
This is like the I built a dirt house in Minecraft of WoW classic. Let people play how they want.
---
then next time say you are talking about something incredibly specific as opposed to a generalized "healers are often just looking at the green bars"
---
lmao is this incendius, ive seen these guys around
---
Based on the kind of player you've described yourself as, I can guarantee that you won't really have fun until Level 60. To make the best of it, try to focus more on doing low level dungeons just to mix things up a bit.
---
Same here.  That one seems to work much much better for me.
---
I just picture you in your 70s reminiscing about how good wow with friends was.
---
Man this hits me in the feels. Warrioring has been a struggle.
---
I guess these are good for Warriors?
---
I mean it doesn’t help when blizzard themselves are trying to force people to rush content, bringing out level boosts for retail. 
---
A lot of people who play now think that’s what the main game is about. 
---
Rush to max level, completely skip hardcore or even core dungeons altogether and get right into mythic+ a race. 
---
People seem to think mythic+ was one of the best things to happen to wow... I honestly think it’s one of the worst.. it’s given people a rush mind set and ultimately ruined the RPG element.
---
The only people rushing 60 are the ones who cheese it on private servers. They're going to be alone at 60 for a WHILE.
---
You lurk in westfall til an alli does the quest then quickly murdwr him and take off with the egg.
---
&gt;I tried to name a shaman busshock but it was taken, so I got busshock instead
---
...what?
---
Also what's offensive about that name?
---
Don’t taunt anything unless it’s the healer that has aggro.  Their repair bill is the best teacher.
---
Shut up you cuck
---
Why do that when you can clear MC in greens?
---
I'm 30 with like 5g
---
Nah I think that would be OK. Drug related names don't get reported much from what I've seen.
---
Yeah, but I feel like that's not really an excuse when you can press c and look at the character sheet. I really liked that each thing did something different, it added a bit of variety to the game.
---
To get to Loch Modan from Stormwind, take the tram in the dwarven district, then go from there to Ironforge, and go out the front gate. Run east through Dun Morogh, and you'll find a path that leads to Loch Modan. Hope this helps!
---
I would love to see Stratholme and Scholo at this quality.
---
*classic wow intensifies*
---
I’ve had a lot of fun playing my Night Elf Druid by myself. I have no idea if that’s considered a ‘good’ solo character or not... I just play what I like. 
---
I’ve had to group up to complete some of the harder quests, but for the most part I’ve been able to handle most things on my own.
---
What bad behavior? You're the only one saying there were other skinners there that wanted to roll on it. Were you there?
---
Yeah, classic is dying rapidly.
---
2% by itself is not that much but considering it comes from one piece of gear alone is a lot. And that 1/50 misses in a boss fight with lots of physical damage adds up. Also for packs of mobs doing physical damage it can also add up pretty good.
---
Rolling a UD female has been awesome.  Battle?  Parkour!
---
Would like to know as well!
---
Rebel camp flight point was put in later.
---
As a level 26 warrior, it ain’t getting easy anytime soon
---
Projecting?
---
Layering plus the natural spreading of players has made the game seem quieter, this is closer to what the game was like by the end of classic.
---
When layers are dropped, ironforge, org, and high end zones will be densely populated.
---
It could have made more than one character. I have a character that I only play when my two other friends are on.
---
A lot of gear gives both so you don't have to choose. STR has the advantage of also giving AP in bear form if you tank though
---
That's a good idea to take from. If I didn't like coming up with my own I'd probably do the same as you with historical names.
---
On MY Christian video game? I don't think so.
---
TEACH ME THIS SHANENIGANS
---
The shit that stresses me out is seeing people in my guild reaching high ass levels when I’m sitting at level 18 lmao.
---
It started as a joke, but in my guild we do posture check whenever we remember and it's been amazing haha
---
Change you to "some people"
---
Yeh we should just take it slow and enjoy the game
---
Tram in Stormwind Dwarven District takes you directly to the back-side of Ironforge.  I'm so sorry for all your Searing Gorge struggles; that was not the way you were meant to go.
---
Hell yea for that name
---
No, Arthas just decided to attack during WOTLK, he is already the lich king
---
Makes sense and I knew other people had to have used it but I had just personally never discussed it with anyone nor came across it IRL.  
---
Most of the change was made back when Fornite came out, I got tired of reaching for certain build keys and hitting alt or ctrl on accident so I just moved right one key and it felt really good.
---
Then Ctrl + 123456
---
bro you spent 230 hours in a single week playing wow?
---
like enough is enough, people need to realize just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. holy shit.
---
40 man raids are a suffrage for me. Yes I know that word means the right to vote, but I'm taking it for MC because it makes you suffer and rage. I'm just here to enjoy the leveling.
---
convert to a raid group
---
I guess with crafting we wont be competiting for gear, but doesnt a voidwalker require a soulstone each time you use it?
---
What? I recommended DOS2 because he did mention POE.  It’s not related to WoW.
---
you say that in public?
---
Wait and go for 1k ^^
---
Guilds will spent it
---
Waiting with bated breath to see how Blizzard handles economic strategies that plagued private servers
---
in Warcraft 3 Lich King was created, made arthas his bitch, arthas killed Sylvanas and made her Banshee, she rebelled against him and created undercity, and Arthas became Lich King.
---
in WOTLK we simply go to Northrend to fight against him.
---
Works for any class/buff, just swap out the spell name!
---
This has been posted a couple hundred times already.
---
WOTLK is just when we deal with the problem. All of that is WC3
---
I’m just pumped that last night I got to 20 on my mage, and 2nd I had enough gold to properly train that jump. 20 is a completely different class and I won’t be oom with bad water every pull
---
Google Remote Desktop or Teamviewer cam start the queue from your phone.
---
I mean to be fair, I supposed having a weeb name is essentially a cardinal sin.
---
Ive been playing on edsf since like... halflife 1.
---
You arent alone.
---
Been a great experience. I have a level 29 shaman and 22 rogue, got invited to an established guild that came over from retail, promoted to officer because they have limited knowledge of vanilla and wanted me to help run things (I've played 13 years, and a few of those were extensively ON TRB, Nost, Kronos, LH). It's been awesome.
---
I feel useful, making friends, and am loving the journey.
---
It wasn't the name being bad enough to warrant a temp ban. It was that it was his third forced change in as many years.
---
I've run dungeons exclusively as Ret so far, and you might not get as many callups as a holy or prot pally would, but you'll still do enough damage to be useful, and the added buff, aura, and off-heals is always nice.
---
ah, fair enough, thought it might be a bit early. I plan to start playing soon and wanted to use it to help my pick a server, waited a bit as I wanted to avoid all the queuing at the beginning.
---
I just got those last night at 22! I'm glad to see that it is as good as people are raving about. Unfortunately I had to get off right as I got it but getting through SFK as ally in classic on a pvp server... Running through hillsbrad is what I imagine one of the layers of hell being.
---
Doing something more and being better at it = more organized
---
Healers are always in demand, it depends on your main spec and gear
---
Lel if you don't like the game don't play it :O
---
I farm because I like to be strong and top the DPS meter. I get fun out of that. 
---
As I said if you don't get fun out of that or pretty much any content besides BG's then it sucks for you.
---
But I could give you content all day right now and all you would say is "why do that twice" - "why farm consumables which is a big part of the game if you don't need it" 
---
Why even level to 60? You can wait 3 month and do BG's with level  19.
---
You already level to 60 once you don't have to do that again.
---
And all the skills you get at 60? You don't need that you can PVP without it. WSG won't need it. Alterac might need it
---
Can you elaborate on how you think classic is proof of this? Do you think it's poorly made? Or just an easy move to go back to something that was already done?
---
Warlock has me triggered
---
Well Mages should be sheeping, Hunters also have traps for cc.
---
33 Lock - was racing to start but that was just so i could get past the crowds.
---
Maybe you chose the wrong class? Maybe try and play with people, do professions, instances. Its not about getting 6 asap, its about enjoying the view. 
---
Or who knows, maybe is just not your cup of tea.
---
I dont feel like you at all. Ive played a lock all my wow life and retail lock feels terrible in all the specs while in vanilla i have to pay attention and i can pull off some dope stuff.
---
No, I believe it happened in warcraft 3 frozen throne
---
you will end up in other zones sooner or later, Hunter is a great class if your new to the game, and often is quicker at leveling.  You can get a zeplin to the undead starting area and have a look around there.  All classes are good and have there good and bad points, ultimately depends on what your goals are at end game.
---
People thinking there's a finish line in this game...
---
I use it when the healer already put a HoT on me, or when I got spare bandages to use so I don't waste the healer's time.
---
Do people feel like interactions like this are more likely/common in WoW classic? If yes, why?
---
I've had no problems with any blizzard games yet. Install lurtis and follow their guide to install dependencies before you install the game. And the amount of games supportet between lutris and steam proton i just don't need windows any more.
---
I think paladin tanks should have a taunt for example.  It's such a minor change that would make paladin tanking raids relevant.  Maybe tweak threat generation for some things so it's viable to have non-warrior tanks.  
---
I think they should implement some stuff that was in BC to make all classes relevant.
---
There is some, a dwarf ran up to a chest i was about to loot and said /roll.. I whispered him 64 as we can't see each others rolls.. he replied with 72 and I laughed that I was trusting him and just let him take it.. just because he didn't try to ninja.
---
I was a little stressed over this actually, thank you for posting this! I have some friends who've been playing a lot more than I have and they are closing in on 60. I have a few bars left to 39 (soon mount yay!).
---
I'm using a guide on where to quest to get a good flow, as I'm a stay at home dad atm. I want to spend the little time I have during the evenings on questing, not necessairly roam the land to look for them.
---
I will continue to trundle on in my own tempo :)
---
Adding as a non-steam game lets you play from your phone if you download steam link.  Sorry if you now lose your job
---
You dont have to...
---
do you know how you clean your ingredients before you start cooking? and then you take the garbage and throw it away? because you don't want to eat garbage.
---
that's how i'm blocking you :). gl with life
---
Yet there are posts every hour about some window licker complaining about having to sit in long queues.
---
26 Druid. Just under a day played right now. Would be further but I spent some time leveling herbalism. 
---
Tanked RFC and WC so far just like when I played Vanilla. I plan on doing SFK and BFD this week. Hopefully getting to 30+ before this weekend.

Salut à toi, pour le moment c'est calme, en 6 jours de jeu on a eu quelques rencontres. Mais le serveur en général est assez chill et on y trouve beaucoup de gens occupés IRL qui jouent à leur rythme sans vouloir être embêtés par le PvP. 
---
Je pense que ça viendra lorsqu'il y aura plus de 60.
---
Si tu viens vraiment pour le PvP je ne te conseille pas Auberdine aujourd'hui. En revanche les serveurs PvP français sont très peuplés. Je te conseille tout de même un serveur francophone afin de profiter un maximum de l'expérience sociale, sauf si tu es très à l'aise avec l'anglais évidemment.
---
Au plaisir de se croiser en jeu.
---
"Horde", Tauren Guerrier de la guilde "Légende"
---
My name is assblasster (mage) and havent heard anything yet but now youre making me fear of a ban haha
---
YOU ARE BEING WATCHED!
---
It’s not so much the streamers themselves as it is the circle jerk fanboys that come with them.
---
Don't DOT the sheep target?
---
You should be DOTing the targets that aren't CC'd, then burning the skull.
---
Also, please don't let your pet taunt off the tank. Ever. It's very, very annoying to the healers, then the tank, then you.
---
Alcoholism is probably more socially acceptable than computer game binging.
---
I'm going to be using Living Root until Corpse maker at 29 on my warrior unless I get some lucky BoE and most horde warriors use Crescent staff for about that long if they don't get the living room.
---
Those are always empty for the most part.  Even in vanilla people would just hang out near the bank/Auction house.
---
I think it's more people being committed to leveling their one character.  So most people are probably in their 30s to 40s I would assume at the moment.  So that's probably were most of the people are.
---
For me the starting zones being empty is great for me.  I can actually get quests done now.  But I'm only level 14 so you can ignore me.  I'm a slowski.
---
Probably with the right gear but the truth is no one is gonna invite a shadow priest to thier group to heal
---
But we don't need mana, neither should you.
---
1g is less and less meaningful as you level too. Having full 8-slot bags and a good weapon at level 6-8 is really valuable.
---
You'll even make up for the gold by having more shit to pick up and vendor with all those bag slots.
---
I rerolled to Warrior from my Shaman (22) a few days ago.  1-11 wasn't so bad.  Hit Barrens at 12 and STRUGGLED to not die 1v1 vs enemies my level.  It was awful.  Spent about 70s from my Shammy on green mail hear for the warrior and that fixed my problems.  Warriors are truly gear dependent asf.
---
Osrs did it better
---
That's true, but I just assumed everybody else is posting their memes and wholesome experiences as well
---
Usually this is how I play games. I've been very surprised by how much I want to play the game. I only get "burnt out" and want a break after 5 or 6 hours.  Usually work, sleep,  or social obligations have been stopping me
---
I would love man
---
Dony lump us all together! As a mage i try my damnest to go out of my way to be by myself away from others and only focus on thay ome camp(dynamic respawns help with this). At the same time, there is nothing more infuriating than when people purposfully being me mobs when im using aoe just to kill me because they hate that they cant aoe farm.
---
I think that no matter what they do, it will come with two things:
---
1. A new fresh
---
2. An option to character copy to a permanent naxx server 
---
My assumption is that classic will operate in cycles. I think too many would be left unsatisfied if there wasn’t a new fresh, and I think there has to be an option for players who just want to continue their characters in a purely-vanilla world.
---
Next thing you'll be turning water into wine.
---
Necrofeelsya reporting for duty
---
Gz! Those are really nice boots! Just around 6\~ more agi and it'd pretty much be +3% avd on a single piece.
---
Nothing injected drama into the game like having two tanks poached by another guild.
---
Haha, what’s up bro. With the release of classic, I’ve been looking back into this again since it was such a great time. It’s Spines, long time no speak. You still talk to any of the other guys? 
---
Side note: with my rogue, spines, we cleared everything so fast that I upgraded from a green- pure agility chest - to blood fang. 
---
PS: I made this video when I was like 15 or 16, so bad but I haven’t seen it in years, this is amazing.
---
If you convert into a raid group, you cant share quest objectives though right?

I looted a blue cloak out of one in the barrens last night, they're not all bad.

---
Nice. Grats man. Still sittin pretty at 24 lol.
---
On the other hand you do get a lot more XP from doing that though. I don't generally mind getting it with a couple of players if it means we can dps them down fast enough. But it depends on the party composition.
---
High pop/queues past like 1pm est, most people are leveled out of that zone by now. Even though I get a few groups coming by I still get decent xp/hr since they respawn fast and are grouped up.

Duuuude. I installed doordash to get something a mile away and drank my first energy drink in years. This is so tight haha
---
That is until you share the wrong screen in Skype or Slack.
---
Srry to hear that
---
That is so damn wholesome. I think I'm gonna start adding some people as well!
---
Really hope they don't release TBC or any expansions on classic, I'd be heartbroken .
---
Madness.
---
Shit, I haven't even installed the game yet!
---
Journey over destination.  
---
I was in a starting zone where 2 players were complaining that there's no point to play the game if there's going to be nothing after Naxx.
---
A level 5 hunter.  Complaining about Naxxramas.  Clearly, he's not playing for the right reasons.  Beyond that, he's not understanding that he will probably never get past MC.
---
I entered General Chat asking him if he can give me the name of a video game that does have a purpose.  He didnt understand my question and gave me a list of the most popular games.
---
&gt;/console rawMouseEnable 1
---
.
---
You say classic is better then begin to trash the game, lmao. Clearly you prefer retail.
---
Well, with the way classic's gone so far it's more of spamming /oom in MC
---
It's a pretty popular method and so it can be dangerous on a PvP server, but farming the basilisk cave in STV can make decent gold per hour, especially with skinning.
---
I was talking about classic, but that's probably more to do with the fact that I can't read apparently.
---
Absolutely not. Im loving classic. It's the game I wanted to play all along.
---
Ah you think animals are your ally? You merely adopted the cat. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a cat, by then it was nothing to me but druidry!
---
I've been playing ALOT maybe 100 hrs or so but I'm not racing like crazy.   
---
I've done every dungeon / dungeon quest once so far (level 45). Levelling first aid, skinning and I'm completing every quest I can within reason in each zone, even if there are better zones.
---
It's a very special case when tanks take that curse. It's PW:S or die.
---
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Told that exact thinf to a priest at the beginning of an RFK run last night and he continued to do it for the rest of the run, when I was at like...above 80% HP. Just instantly took it off myself...waste of mana for him.
---
Some people don't like being told how to improve :/.
---
Totem does not override temporary weapon buffs (sharpening stones, poisons).
---
Hey! I saw you a couple days ago and thought your name was funny as hell. Sorry.
---
Does it actually matter what food you feed your pet?  Not type, I get it matters depending on the pet what types they're allowed to eat.  I mean the level of the food.  If I feed my pet raw boar meat from the lowest level mobs in the game versus cooked endgame food is there a difference?
---
On the other hand, I have my shadow priest that I raided on briefly named Nohealsforu.
---
What talents would you recommend? I went wand specialization 5, Spirit Tap 5, then Martyrdom 2 and I'm not really sure where to prioritize from there. Meditation and Inner Focus seem juicy, but I know a lot of folks say to focus on shadow for leveling.
---
I have a 144hz monitor and the horsepower to drive it, but I limit mine to 100FPS because then my GPU fans never kick in. I'd rather have the silent CPU than the extra frames in this instance.
---
 I feel you im almost at 2 /played and just hit 27 lol
---
Check the link below.
---
Yes they are.  But it doesn’t make it any less tedious.  Also, it’s difficult to aoe blizzard farm because the realms are so populated.
---
[According to Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=30798/dual-wield), it was added in 1.13. Classic is on 1.12.
---
Make sure your priest knows power word shield meas less rage for you as it negates incoming damage.
---
Apart from that its pretty much as easy as you would expect.
---
Hey, they reached level 20 as a warrior!
---
maybe because maxing in runescape takes way longer and much more effort than hitting 60 in wow?
---
Yeah it's made me want to play it but I know I won't like it. It has a great way of building me up as a powerful character then taking all the power away.
---
Instead of question marks for complete quests on minimap I have dots. Is it how things are supposed to be? How should I find on the big map where to go with my complete quest if I forgot who's the questgiver?
---
the key part getting a new weapon after the whirlwind axe. or just endlessly spam dungeons since that is honestly a much more pleasant experiance.
---
like straight up my tactic is to spam run ZF and get Sul'thraze the Lasher for level 50. due to the weapon swing normalization this weapon is amongst the best you can get pre-raid aswell
---
I would feel like this if my job wasn't being sit in a fucking office char for 8+ hours looking at a fucking screen.
---
You also have demoralizing roar, which can hit all the targets. Also any healing you do and thorns can help. I'm with you in that people focusing on "what the streamers" are doing, but you're better off just pre-hotting, enraging, and spamming demo roar past a certain number of targets.
---
Too much work on top of ancient code imo.
---
Just re-release TBC and Wotlk like Classic, and use feedback and lessons learned to either create a new retail xpac that breathes new life into it (by re-incorporating the features of the classic trilogy that everyone loves), or just roll them into a new MMO altogether.
---
It's generally worthless right now.  You want stats on your gear. Like having more int is better because you can cast more.
---
Sometimes you can loot them. Otherwise you have to buy them or have someone in your guild make them for you. You could make them yourself if you took tailoring as a profession.
---
For anyone that has that financial independence... you hiring??
---
I know the difference, check the link below.
---
Same goes for druids. I had a priest in WC thinking he was helping me out by casting it.
---
It's a great ability for DPS that is taking damage. But not so much for the rage tanks.
---
That's not supposed to happen...
---
Check again after servers are back online.
---
Kind of like seasons in diablo, a lot of people like starting from fresh.
---
Also add. Don’t stand up to quickly or you’ll get light headed and fall on your face
---
My co-worker has decided to be a completionist. She is doing every single quest in every single zone, even once they turn gray, and taking her time doing it. She is enjoying the hell out of it. I'm leveling with a friend and we're just bouncing around zones as my ADD dictates while enjoying it - he has never played wow, so we're getting to see a lot of the zones even if we 'waste' a lot of time travelling. Play how you want!
---
This is fair. However, you can expect prices to rise in the coming weeks as people level further into the game and the economy starts to get its footing. It'll be better to bank a lot of the mats for a bit more time and then reevaluate if you should sell. 
---
If your goal is to get 100g at level 40 for the mount, it might make sense to just hold mats (as well as some rare items and whatnot) until level 38 or so, then begin clearing house around then. 
---
That said, Light Leather and Medium Leather are pretty much always just vendor-able instead of auctioning.
---
Best waste of my time I ever had. As for longevity.. that's what alts are for. (:
---
But yet they had click bait titles on their streams “Method World Face Race...” even the commentators said they were in the race and after they loss the world first 60 race, they said they were going for Rag and Ony world first... stop trying to defend them.
---
I'm playing at max graphics and all weather effects seem to work. 
---
I've also changed my weather density whilst it was raining and get weather effects on setting 1, 2 and 3.
---
&gt; JeroyLenkins. I was mostly shocked that the name wasn't already taken.
---
It's because you spelled it wrong. The original is Leeroy Jenkins.
---
I legit saw the price of that flight path yesterday and reconsidered if I needed to go there again just yet 😓 I’m broke
---
Skinning doesn't go well with tailoring, its just extra money.
---
You don't need anything to go with tailoring since you get cloth from drops.
---
Enchanting is generally just a useless gold sink since you can get enchants from other people and the mats you get from DEing aren't worth unless you are a designated enchanter for a 5man dungeon group.
---
Is it possible to display just enemy nameplates and if so how do you do it? I can toggle all nameplates but not sure how to only display enemy ones
---
Hunters and warlocks are probably the best classes to run solo. Druid, paladin are probably next best IMO, but not as good.
---
I personally love the desert, I assume you mean The Barrens. You could take your troll over to the Eastern Kingdoms by using the Zeppelin outside Orgrimmar and quest in the undead area. Tirisfal glades and the next zone Silverpine Forest are wooded and more atmospheric. The only problem is that you will need to go back to Org to train since there are no hunter trainers in that zone. Also the undead aesthetic is not to everybody's taste.
---
Alternatively you could roll an undead warlock which is another good solo-ing class and you will start in Tirisfal and there are warlock trainers there. Orcs can also be warlocks so you could start an orc and then head over to Tirisfal.
---
For the Alliance side night-elf hunters also start in a wooded area and their next area is woods too. Humans start in woods then move to a more open area. Dwarves (hunter) and gnomes (warlock) start in snowy hills/mountains.
---
The big thing that made me quite retail is dungeons/raids/guilds. I was a casual player and although I had 4-5 level capped toons, nobody wanted me in their guild or group or raid because I wasn't some hardcore gamer who had ultra high item level and knew the best rotations. It got really lonely.
---
More viewers than this subreddit has subscribers, and as many followers as /r/wow has subscribers, but people still rush to every thread about him to type "Who????" to show their superiority in not following the game on media.  
---
I find it funny how it's the same people rushing to type "Who?" in every thread, as if they don't remember typing "Who?" yesterday in a thread about him.
---
Nice, grats! I've been staring at the quest in my quest log, I really should get around to finding some blokes to help me out. Such a good looking weapon.
---
Its either that or Chuck Norris jokes
---
:-)
---
I play on a couple different servers. It seems like the bulk of people have moved on from the starting areas by now.
---
Should be fine, I had the name Phoqueoff for a long time
---
You can do SM GY at 31.
---
Pretty sure it was a vocal minority that lead us to where we are. As well as some poor decisions by Blizz in the grand scheme of things, not the playerbase itself.
---
9.6k, half of them are in the queue on my server , so, yeah.
---
Could be they switched servers or something also
---
But I'm RPing as a rogue!
---
Yeah. Why is it so hidden?
---
No they are just alliance.
---
The deaths only make you stronger brother! Molding you bit by bit into a mighty warrior!
---
I’m not going to have time to get heavily into end-game stuff, so I’m in no hurry at all.
---
I get why some people do want to get through to end game asap and that’s obviously fine as long as they’re having fun. And there’s always alts for enjoying a more laid-back game :)
---
im not quite sure how long all the phases will last but as I said, most people still playing would probably be 60 at that time.
---
Lol yeh gold tends to not matter in retail it’s trivial oh you need 20k here you go pay me back in 2 weeks. Meanwhile I’ve made double that on the AH over two weeks.
---
MY man, I love hunters in my groups as a healer.  They add off tanks and I can heal everything easier.
---
Yep popped all my cooldowns.
---
why the fuck would you even buy a 144hz then, or not just buy a headset with it.
---
Modifying game files will result in a account ban.
---
Man i'm one of those "dreamers". At least for now.
---
I've had a shitty social interaction situation with the guild i've joined and i've lost all my enthusiasm.  
---
Funny thing: After that happend i was thinking about dungeon finder in retail. I've never had that kind of situation in retail, because nobody ever talks\^\^
---
Prot Warrior here, can confirm it is a painful experience.
---
no... it's really not.  In classic most classes have at most 1 viable build.
---
Even better
---
Oh whats that, you are clearing adds for elite quest mob in Redridge... lets just steal the main elite...
---
And then someone will join our party after who needs it and TRY TO STEAL IT AGAIN.
---
Too bad I’m a hunter bitch.
---
&gt;The name was Animetiddies.
---
Cray, is that you?
---
It's what's above the cave that loses sleep, an undiscoverable lake area.
---
So I run a census addon and am playing on Whitemane Alliance. I’m level 34 and in the top 20% of players in level. Don’t take the twitch streamers and Pserver guilds as a barometer of where you should be.
---
I don’t get this. You Play Classic WoW? Yet you 
---
hate when the Community is focused on more than min-maxing/gameplay mechanics? 
---
That’s like buying breakfast at a restaurant and then complaining that the foods hot.
---
I rather eat a man's ass.
---
Watch the tail
---
I wonder if I'll still feel the same way after playing classic all the way to 60, maybe I'm just a bit bored of being LVL 22 and only doing deadmines haha
---
Our tank left 10 minutes in because he wasnt getting any and wanted to find a group who has already done the quest. Lol gl with that
---
I believe the hot key is V
---
The graphics are dated, but what amazed me is how far ahead wow was when it first came out. I don’t remember any other games that had that big of a world back in the early 2000’s. I never played wow before classic either and i was dumbfounded how advanced it was.
---
Haha, when asked i'm like "Best weekend of all TIME!!!"
---
coworker "Really? what did you do?"
---
"I LIVED TO WIN!!!"
---
Cool
---
Yeah, the same,  but I don't mind when it's WoW time lol
---
Is that from Kirtonos (US realm) ?
---
Don’t farm for upvotes. It violates Reddit ToS. It can get you banned.
---
Haha, I know. I died twice while doing these quest ! Still have fun !
---
Sounds more like a job than playing a game...
---
No flying mounts. Wpvp is real.
---
I’ve had some frustrations tanking with people but most of the people trying to do weird stuff are hunters. Pets growl on to “Help” me tank, attacking when I’m pulling back, etc. 
---
Shaman is just extremely hard to get threat off of due to lots of them using Earth Shock and Rockbiter early on, but their DPS has been so high I’ve just put up with it, long as they focus target
---
You supported the stealing and hacking of accounts. You are scum.
---
Make sure you do it right before the teleport, so they're in the middle of the ocean with no help for miles.
---
Sarcasm is the hallmark of insecurity.
---
I wish more healers had this mindset, I hate having healers heal my life tap damage.  It's faster for me to tap to full and eat than drink twice to fill the larger mana pool, but instead of saving time the priest will spend half their mana on healing me back up even though I'm already eating.
---
If you still get on this I think I have screenshots still from
---
Back then, I’ll check tomorrow
---
Lol that's the exact same quest🤣 I had to fire blast and wand all of them. If two attacked me, I had to run!
---
They need to attack whatever the tank is attacking.
---
[Nope.](https://imgur.com/1glxi) You can see [Here] (That they changed for BC. [This] source also briefly mentions the color shift, from pink to blue at BC and blue to a different blue at cata.
---
Did that last night, almost gave up that quest. Then again I probably shouldn’t have gone there at lvl 12.
---
la plaisanterie est que le Frence épelle les choses différemment et quand vous les lisez en anglais, elles ont l'air bizarre. en tant qu'américain, je me moquais de votre accent.
---
I agree with everything you say here.
---
People are fools for saying you "shouldn't dictate how they (people pushing for 60) should play" - clearly you weren't suggesting that people SHOULDN'T push for 60. You were saying that if you are someone who isn't, then don't worry about it, don't be stressed, etc. 
---
As you said, we're going to get there over time - the main reason we wouldn't is if you pushed it too hard and got too burned out!
---
Shamans...I doubt you could even imagine...
---
[a la Elden Ring]
---
Just use "Auction Faster" ;)
---
To afraid to play druid cause hunters wreck druids!
---
Hi, my group of friends and I are all playing WoW for the first time. Our main group consists of a hunter, warrior, druid, and priest. We did our first dungeon yesterday, I believe it's called raging chasm, and were able to do it pretty easily since we were overleveled (all around 20). I was pulling most of the mobs as hunter since I had the longest range and could pull just a few mobs at a time, and my pet would aggro the first mob I pulled with growl, however the other mobs pulled would usually aggro on to me and my warrior friend would have to run and get aggro off of me. Would it be more efficient for the warrior to aggro stuff? We were worried he would pull more than we could handle since he would have to get close, hence me pulling at max range.
---
I found Perl Classic.  Didnt know about this one.  I love the way the classes are listed in certain columns:
---
[https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/94/725/perl-classic-unit-frames-perl-classic-v0-67-with-ctra.jpg](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/94/725/perl-classic-unit-frames-perl-classic-v0-67-with-ctra.jpg)
---
Why I liked XPerl all those years ago:
---
1) It was cleaner
---
2) You could see an icon for players class and level was shown
---
3) I could make my buff icons larger than debuffs to see what was going on
---
4) Most importantly, I automatically set it up to highlight a frame when there was a debuff I could dispel.  This was a super important.  
---
5) I believe it had enemy cast bars.  Right now I cannot see anything.
---
Thank you again, but dont you need an addon for checking How many items on Wow?
---
I've literally lost the urge to play games for about 3-4 years now. I actually have an urge to play something again and curse going to work.
---
10/10
---
I tell you guys, fucking tailoring...
---
Stupid sexy minions.
---
I'd say that's somewhat accurate. My guild has people in the 35-40 range. But also a lot of people in the lower lvls rerolling, or just couldnt play the first couple of days.
---
It only really matters if you plan on raiding as most guilds raid in the evening after work and school.  Being I'm a different time zone can make finding groups  more difficult if you can't start at those times because of the time difference.
---
Think of it this way.
---
Take now with the same subs: shareholders see more players are playing and think "yep they did something right, doing classic increased revenue by x". There's no need to stop anything or look deeply because revenue increased.
---
Now different subs: shareholders now see that classic is skyrocketing over retail (no idea if this is true or amounts, just example). Now all the sudden their might be eyes on why one revenue stream is way more profitable then the other one and a couple months down the line maybe retail becomes an expense or classic dies or investors are pressuring blizzard to focus on whatever is generating the most money.
---
Tldr:
---
It's kinda weird, but it really just boils down to, nobody cares when things are positive. Separating them would potentially introduce small numbers or negatives, where keeping them together makes a positive bigger.
---
S P I C E D  W O L F M E A T
---
5 minutes to cross the street. Damn, you've got some wide streets my rural brain is thinking.
---
As a level 25 hunter, I’m in it for the level 60 tracking down Alliance scum in STV like it’s Vietnam experience
---
"Play my way and level up or you do not get to have your voice heard."
---
Is what you are saying.
---
I got told off for looting the blooms when i should let the others in the group have a chance to loot them
---
The only irresponsible thing you did was order from Dominos.  Surely there's a quality pizzeria in your area you could support.
---
So did you fuck anyone over who needed to do the quest on your server? That's hilarious
---
Looking for any and all tips/tricks/guides for Warrior tanking. Going to be Deadmines-level in like 1-2 days and I dont usually tank in games.
---
PWS is highly inefficient regardless, I'm just saying that even with PWS you should be able to get aggro. Bears can pre-HoT themselves as they run into a fight and gain a ton of aggro that way. Roar also generates an ass-ton of threat.
---
You’ll probably find it on RP servers, and more frequently when the initial leveling Zerg has calmed down
---
As a tank I really appreciate who wrote that.
---
Oh interesting, i am goona check that out.
---
I actually accept the channel invitation, because then you can go to the channel tab, highlight their name, and report them.  I can’t find another way to report the name because there’s no where else to right click report.
---
Then I leave the channel after filling out the report.
---
It may be futile, but it makes me feel better.
---
To my fellow levelers, get sleep and real food. Don’t neglect your real life obligations. Wow classic is here to stay and you’ll have plenty of time to play at 60. Good luck all.
---
Less of a tourism thing and more of an extreme queue times thing
---
Huh. Animetiddies was taken on my realm so I created a character called Animetiddy. Guess I'll... Delete it...
---
That's nice to hear. We are similarly going to be pretty far apart on leveling but it isn't the worst thing, because she'll be forced to learn without hand holding.
---
Fairbanks? I was laughing about your name the other day.
---
Level 12 paladin represent!
---
Thank you guys!!
---
Would love to see Org, Undercity, or Thunder Bluff!
---
We are all in this together my man
---
in my experience light and medium are to be vendored. the potential profit for undercutting on the AH is scraps. like a medium stack sells for 10s to vendor, you can sell on AH for maybe 10s50c. is that 50c worth the time investment for setting them all up on AH, filling bag space while leveling, etc.? For me, the answer is no.
---
Hides on the other hand, keep all your hides. Thems the profit on AH.
---
And the EU having humane working laws like mandatory PTO but sure its the welfare.
---
If that doesn't work try /console reloadui That will cause the whole IU to reload just like logging into the game. You will lose all settings you've changed since your last login because those are saved to memory on game exit.
---
Hard to see because of the sky but that's special :)
---
Paladins can't use rifles or guns. You can use engineering bombs, and the one from the Goldshire intro quest.
---
Ahead?
---
I have been doing the same, ez 30g an hour.
---
I always used names i picked randomly from the edda. Sometimes ended up with weird ones like gandalf or drogo.
---
Feign death only drops the aggro you just built. It doesn't send them back to the tank. Good chance the mob will just move on to the healer, since the tank has no threat on them and the healer does.
---
I'm not funny and yet you laughed.
---
Hmm.
---
Elephant in the room is that the drop off is going to be practically nothing over phase 1.
---
Retail is bad and there is nothing else out there in the genre.
---
They need to lock character creation on the full realms.v
---
I'm a busy guy but was proud to hit 30 over labor day weekend. I didn't start playing until last Thursday so I was a few days late. Enjoying classic, servers seem healthy too.
---
as you get into endgame content mana conservation becomes a thing. So for example, if you're a healer, and someone is only a *little* hurt you don't really need to burn a max rank heal on them.
---
Just uncheck it
---
what?? it most certainly did not run on a modified WC3 engine. the early POC ran on a modified WC3, but the WC3 engine was built for large amounts of units and not rendering large polygons in a first person perspective so they **rewrote the engine from scratch**.
---
go read the wow dev diaries by Jon Staats (like I recommended above) before you keep talking more BS.
---
You guys have leveled up?
---
The whole reason wow classic is so appealing is that leveling is the game.
---
After the expansions hit it started to feel like an inconvenience before the game actually got started.
---
I never read a quest log, just rushed to the map icons and tried to turn them in as tactically as possible.
---
It’s hard to say. Average is probably lower than I’d think, but I’m surrounded by guildies in their upper 30’s and 40’s. Obviously no-lifing the game lol
---
Nah lol, because Stitches spawns after you hand the quest in. And you don't need to kill him for any quest or anything, it's just a zone event that happens.
---
Just scale it up until you don't get FPS drops anymore.
---
Extremely incorrect and has absolutely no foundation as fact. 
---
A great many people, including myself, are playing Classic because they find it to be the best (including better than TBC) and have no desire to play TBC or beyond.
---
I know there *are* people anticipating TBC but it's presumptuous and just straight up incorrect to state that MOST people are.
---
This is why I created a guild called {Dad Bod} on Westfall.  For those of us that are here for the ride and definitely have other responsibilities.
---
Usually there's always some useless stuff I can delete if necessary
---
Priest solo = masochism
---
Warr solo = masochism
---
Together = wrecking crew
---
Yeah the hard limit to all this is the healer's mana.  If you're at 10%, we're finishing off a large aoe pack, then a dps bodypulls another large pack, it's RIP.  Luckily, this rarely ever happens.  I find if the mb is announced as the pack of mobs dies and the tank sits down, the chance of a DPS diving into another bodypull is very small.
---
I went away for the weekend with family. Came back and felt bad that I'm only level 25. Then I realized level 25 is roughly 34 hours of my playtime and that's an insane amount of hours I've been able to cram in in less than 1 week despite Herod que times.
---
I was myself hyped for fast grind to 60.. but on my server are constantly 5h queves (all my rl friends and our community is here so no way that I can play on other server) .. so Since Im not using any queve abusing stuff I can play only halve of the time because Im few hours in queve every day .. so Im now playing slowly becouse I cant play more .. this may be reason why some players choosed other realms with less queves and some maybe quit playing becouse of queves .. and I do not care anymore raid is cleared already 60 lvls are here becouse they was abusing raid xp and now this was nerfed .. our guild with full 1000members have atleast 300 dead and 200 more super casual ..
---
Nopeeeee
---
Never needed to talk to ppl doin +10's
---
Questing? If you leave AFK and comeback you won't be dead.
---
I’d say you’re near spot on. Lots of rerolls, queue avoiders and queue victims.
---
I’m leveling a paladin and a warlock at the same time. Currently sitting at level 27 with 20g on each. I’m rich!
---
Any recommendation for a threat meter?
---
I believe it's a really bad joke (Anathema is an epic priest staff). The server is good though, I played all weekend with enough people to do quests and dungeons and stuff, but not so many I have to compete for mobs or can't login.
---
I also encountered this same bear as a level 26 druid. Took a lot of shifting in and out of bear/cat/regular, and some food buffs and mana pots, but I got some sick green bracers.
---
oomkins
---
thunderclap is garbage.
---
Tell then it's you or the bought gold. They can pick. When they delete the gold you can be friends again. 😂
---
You'll find it at night, at Goldshire. Juste came dress like a man and walk. Not run, just walk and ask for a beer. It is how it works.
---
It's the default marker.
---
Holy crap thanks!! How do you know which slot is which, so that you keep your items in the right bag slot for the macro?
---
Why are you so defensive?
---
Have you played FFXIV? The classes all have rotations, buffs and procs to manage. They also have a limit gauge essentially that slows you to use more powerful abilities when you build enough gauge.
---
Imo it makes for a much more interesting pve experience and leaves a lot of room for optimization. The difference between an average Black Mage in FFXIV and one that has mastered the fight and their rotations, coordinating with party members (like their dancer partner) is a massive difference in damage. 
---
The way I look at it is this. A rotation for the sake of pressing more buttons is bad game design. If a rotation is designed with class fantasy in mind, interesting abilities and decisions to make based on the fight or situation, and also adds a layer of teamwork, I think it’s a huge benefit to the PvE experience.
---
Cheers for the response, firstly I'd like to say you're a prat. Secondly it wasnt clear to me whether or not this is from a rare mob or any mob so I just wanted that clarifying.
---
Snipping Tool?
---
Real
---
This is my forever game. Whether I play it in 16 hour stretches or just log in to fish and surf the AH, this game is my jam.
---
Probably around 20 yeah...  
---
Running census every day the spikes are 10 and 15, but that's where the bigger early walls are, so most people probably stopped there, inflating the numbers.
---
I don't know about casters, they were higher, but melee had a hit cap of 264 in WotLK. Also needed 26 expertise but I don't remember how much rating that was. Defense cap for tanks was 540. I really miss that part of gearing, having to balance those basic necessities, along with some classes aiming for soft caps on other stats.

---
Any way to have 240? This option caps at 200 and I have a 240hz monitor.
---
I didn't take off work, and then this weekend I was at dragon con so I didn't play much then either. I'm at lvl 21 and seem to be in the upper end of my guild. I don't think anybody in my guild has hit 40 yet.
---
I see kitty I upvote.
---
Going by the tooltips, Renew R5 is 360 HP for 170 mana, (360/170)*1,15(Imp. Renew)=2.42 hp/mana, Flash Heal R4 us (339+406/2)/185=2.01 Hp/mana, Heal R4 is (730+822/2)/274=2.83 and Shield R5 is 312/210=1.48 hp/m
---
The math goes in my favor.
---
I mean it gets better once tanks get some more gear and levels, but in low level dungeons, you are pretty much just going in with 4 dps and a healer.
---
Oh hmm. I didn't have my gold at 40, got it at 43. Lots of quests after 40 give good gold.
---
Making a fair amount of money with leatherworking
---
He has a point though, they were so hard to come by because nobody knew they'd be required when AQ opened.  Now that the top guilds know beforehand and are stockpiling, they won't be nearly as expensive.    
---
They'll still be expensive though.
---
Why are so many people feeling pressured to rush to 60? That's how you get burned out.
---
I like adventuring and the leveling process.  I jump between characters
---
There is nott meant to be balanced, and then there is missing core tools needed to fulfill a role that you are ostensibly supposed to be able to.
---
I don't play wow anymore haven't for years. I started playing a couple months before BC came out. I remember it took me I think an entire year to reach level 70. Take your time and enjoy the ride people!
---
Two best names I've seen have been Cumblaster and Durtturd. I asked, "Gunning for a name change eh?" "Lol yup"
---
Hit 30 on my warrior and got corpsemaker! Can’t ask for much more
---
This. I decided to quest there, until I realized there were about 20 horde doing the same and only myself and one other alliance guy. I said nope and went back to dungeon grinding.
---
A human paladin haHAA
---
Classic guilds always end up recruiting. People end up leaving and with 40 available slots ; it’s fairly easy to find one
---
I had a bank alt named "fauxqueue" who (so far as I know) was never reported.
---
Imagine being so pretentious
---
It's in your settings, raid frames or something like that.
---
My warlock on suramar is named Gnomercy!!!
---
Booooooo on that ban!
---
I was racing to 60 but I have just been doing other stuff the past 2 days and now I feel behind :(. I just wish all my friends who played had a similar schedule so we could all play together.
---
I'm not on an RP server though
---
Toxic
---
Quit breaking Name Policy and breaking EULA. 
---
I ain't dictating *how* people play, do whatever you want. 
---
Is gold selling/PL ok with you? That's also against the EULA.
---
But why keep doing it? I'm not saying anyone it's offended, probably just annoyed. And you certainly can't complain about it when you admit it's childish... Your thought process is perplexing.
---
Make a chat tab just for lfg. Maybe another one just for trade chat as well
---
As a warlock for many years who aggressively pulled and off yanked in dungeons... I’m sure I’m about to get my just desserts healing seriously for the first time.
---
I went a year with my priest, lilangelfuq, being safe. I got a forced name change after some wpvp that didn't go well for the other side. I renamed her with a different spelling of the same name, got hit with a forced name change again after some wpvp. I figured that 2 name changes in a week was pushing it and went with a sightly safer name.
---
Just a heads up, doing this sort of thing makes you an asshole. Should be mindful of this behaviour in the future or people will just flat out kick you from groups. Nobody invites a mage and expects them to behave like that because its not what you should be doing. Most groups arent mage farm groups.
---
I mean absolutely play however makes you happy. But recognize the thinness of the endgame and the fact unless clearing MC early means something to you, you’re probably not going to have any tangible advantage over people who take their time in the phases to come gear or exp wise.
---
Doesn't matter what wep as much. Humans and orcs have racial bonuses
---
Yes, i know. That's not at all what i am discussing. I was talking about an imaginary situation that a Dps warrior would be required to stancedance to Defensive stance to use revenge every 3 seconds to do competetive dps. Which would feel weird, because when you imagine a furious gladiator with massive weapons. You don't imagine that gladiator switching back and forth into an agressive and defensive stance like a monkey while doing damage, yet Ferals has to.
---
and No, im not asking for changes or balance.
---
low key I feel like people are OP are secretly salty that other people are going so fast because they're going to be more progressed than them. They want *everyone* to RP walk to every mob like they do, so they can play the game their way but still get 60 at the same time as everyone else. As much as they love RP walking, they don't love the idea of being months and months behind a large pack of players. 
---
Just a theory
---
Most are...it's a fact. It's presumptuous and straight up incorrect to assume because you feel a certain way most are not
---
I believe hes referring to the fact that everyone is going nuts over Classic, a 15 year old game that the current company had little to do with due to personnel and talent changes. That was my interpretation, that Classic is so much better than Retail it helps illustrate the different direction of the company as a whole. 
---
If you could reconvene the team that created WoW 20 years ago, then you would most likely have a decent WoW 2, but the current company would not be able to produce a product on par with the original.
---
Thunderclap holds 0 threat unless you absolutely spam it on which case good luck holding threat on the focus target :(
---
How do I mage money?
---
I’m a lvl 22 frost mage learning how to play. I have spent all my money on learning all recipes for tailoring and enchanting. I regret this. I have also spent my money on learning all fire and arcane skills. I regret this because I cannot purchase my 20+ skills for Frost. 
---
How do I make gold so I can get the skills needed? 
---
I’m Fairbanks realm and my name is OleMiss. All advice is welcomed.
---
Same here at lvl 21 and seems like I'm just barely in the upper half of my guild.
---
I hope so
---
Yeah but the great thing about skinning is, the entire world just leaves money laying around for you.
---
Two handed axes and maces are a talent in the enhancement talent, after learning the talent you can learn them from a trainer
---
Ashenvale, wetlands, hillsbrad foothills, I'm sure there are a couple I'm leaving out too.
---
Soooo...what useless green item did you get?
---
Well they already screwed up by picking alliance. Good job
---
Ask in /1 for a tailor and try to make friends, they can make you new bags each tier of cloth you farm.
---
Wait, you can get the tabard now?! i thought it wasn't until a later phase.
---
Sounds like the quest in thousand needles to collect plants near water elementals immune to frost
---
Fortunately a friendly priest was there killing stuff and I just swam around and grabbed respawning ones from previously cleared spots and chatted
---
"wHy iS ThErE nO mOrE cOntEnT?"
---
And blizzard! I'm so looking forward to that.
---
So just someone in a guild? That's it?
---
Yea it's so funny in that became entertainment as in, at first everyone seemed to let the mage sweat like O Fuk i'm about to die, then the light show erupts and they are just so happy for the help and pretty sure they have no idea wtf is going for a bit.
---
I really need to be recording 24/7 while playing, it's just something after something after something, you just don't get this level of memories and experiences in fisher price spoon fed mmo's, everyone is too busy chasing a f'ing arrow.
---
Ahh how could I forget, camping 20s outside dungeon entrances. 
---
Top tier PvP
---
Hmm thanks mate need to find some good location I guess
---
Nah, I think I just walked past you.
---
Dunno, it costs $37.
---
What spec did you level as?
---
Only as important as your schedule says they are. I’m on be west coast but play on an east coast server because I moved and all my buddies are back home. They’re 3 hours ahead if they wanted to stuff at 7 that means I get on at 4. If it was the other way around you would need to stay up late to play with people. It doesn’t matter unless you can’t make schedules events due to time.
---
&gt; the demand for making more money from those in power. Current Blizzard is absolutely capable of Classic+ 
---
No he isn't. We are. The tens of thousands playing, the tens of thousands in the queue waiting to play.
---
WE are the face of classic. Asmongold is an entertainer.
---
I do both at the same time.
---
Why do you think Tauren get a natural +15 to herbalism?
---
Health management is a struggle, as well as being restricted to single target or small group pulls while leveling. They don't scale well until late levels is why people normally say that.
---
&gt;The rate at which pet focus regenerates is not always consistent. Note: While the actual amount of focus that can be generated per tick is inconsistent, the total amount generated over time is flat and consistent. There are slight variations in the time between ticks that cause this to display inconsistently.
---
I read the whole post even though most of it doesn't apply to Rogues. To be clear, it doesn't specifically mention that Rogues' energy should function the same as a Hunter's pet's focus. I, personally, would like clarification from Blizzard on this point. It actually has a significant impact on gameplay. 
---
I'm not asking for a change. Just clarification on whether Energy acts the same as Focus.
---
OP should post a bug report to the forums.
---
Cringy. Who cares?
---
I don't think I even have rend on my defensive stance bar. Sunder, shield block, and revenge get most things on me pretty well. Throw in some shouts and a cleave or two on larger packs, and I'm largely golden as long as the group follows the skull mark.
---
What did I state that millions of people disagree with?
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say, I asked you to clarify what you expected out of the content.
---
Back in vanilla people were new to the game and didnt understand threat well either.  It's the same problem but for different reasons.
---
keybind "pet ability 1" to your mousewheel up or mousewheel down
---
No no. You have to play slowly and smell the roses other you should go back to retail
---
Group with a healer.
---
Oh yea that would be even worse. Handed my thesis in yesterday though, so feeling pretty good right now.
---
You got lvl 37 now, that's pretty high if you're working on your thesis.
---
Man, when I first started WoW, my buddies had already been playing for a while. They were raiding while I was leveling.  There was one day where I had logged out at Tarren Mill and when I came back online, everything was on fire.  I complained on vent how the alliance raid was killing the fightmaster and quest npc over and over.  Next thing I know, a quarter of my guild is in hillsbrad with another quarter in org and undercity recruiting more pvpers.  Apparently some alliance players went back to their capitals to recruit more players.  The ensuing bloodbath reduced my frame rate to "slideshow".  
---
Good times
---
Go and level somewhere were the enemies are 1-2 levels below you.
---
Bruh why you being so negative he said if racing is affecting your mental/real life then it's ok to take your time. If you don't have any responsibilities then that's fine you can keep being the hardcore gamer that you are.
---
Frost is more survivability but fire offers more damage. U can very much level with fire, I did it before. The single target dps is outstanding. Overall tho this is likely to be slower with leveling since u lack survivability and aoe grind potential
---
I feel like they are harsher now than they used to be. I had "Lilangelfuq" (Misfits song reference) for a while before getting hit with a name change but that was it.
---
Ratchet is also a good place to get quests. Maybe give the addon questie a chance. It shows you available quests and where to finish them.
---
Try not to pull more than 1 mob
---
ctrl v or shift v
---
Which makes hit even more important, because you can be subject to RNG. If you only do 20 attacks in a fight, and you get unlucky and 5 of those attacks miss then its a huge deal.
---
It has a long ass cooldown doesn't it?
---
They cost 8c on my ah
---
It makes me laugh howany people wanted the classic experience but just rush through it. I've only just hit 20 myself but might come back a few weeks later, fed up of walking back and forth finding no quest mobs.
---
Very unlikely but not impossible. Each clue has the same chance of dropping it so for every clue he does he's no closer than he was at 1 master clues completed.
---
Guidelime is terrible. Use azeroth auto pilot
---
I think it'd be dope if they added a "Classic Launcher" option to battle.net, so that it looked like the old WoW launcher from vanilla, with just the WoW news, a patch loading bar, and a play button.
---
Yes, that's long term. That doesn't apply in this scenario where you might only get hit 10 times a fight, or less, and you have nothing to gain really whether it works or doesn't, there is no tangible long term benefit.
---
I'd still wait another month to sell it when people have more gold.
---
I regressed my maturity to 2004 era to truly get the real Vanilla WoW experience. 
---
My void walker even got named Thannos, so that’s two silly names for the price of one.
---
You lack escape tools. You pull too many mobs at once, it's win or die time.
---
If you know your healer just let the dps die :P if I come across a dps that doesn’t give a fuck about threat or mana then I just watch him die. They tend to learn, and if not fuck em.
---
I report inappropriate things when I deem it appropriate and realized I should probably stop because it flags the reporters name too and I don’t want to lose healslut.
---
Gotta stable it
---
I wish my job would say this. I can live a month without a job personally and month of grinding sounds perfect.
---
Buy wands- and keep your wand as high level as you can manage. Soloing becomes a LOT easier when you do this. 
---
You will need to put "SHOOT" on your toolbar to use your wand, and it's a skill you'll have to level up like any other weapon. But it's very easy to do and you will have almost no downtime. Further, in groups, you'll actually be helping damage without worrying about mana.
---
Sound fun /s
---
You know you can change wst so you don't have to look at the bars while out of combat right?
---
Not good at all for raiding but is a beast at dungeon content.
---
Asked for 4 silver yesterday and noone gave it to me :'(
---
prebis is bloodmail you scrubs.
---
High resolutions?
---
Absolutely. Play how you want to play folks.
---
Got to Hillsbrad last night and started PvP. Here comes an alliance 40+ Hunter that poops on me and my two friends after killing the alliance.  Hope to see more wpvp on Kurinnaxx but seemed light.
---
It was an inspiration, so you weren't far off!
---
DS3 is a bloody amazing game. 
---
Currently playing DS1 on the switch - it's just as good as the first time!
---
So you agree with me ?  
---
Different realms call it differently, while the majority called it correctly, DM. As stated by Kevin Jordan himself.
---
I have a part time job and a girlfriend and I can barely play for 3-4 hours. Kill me.
---
i got to 40 last night. my eyes, hands, forefarms, fingers, physically hurt. do not be me. really it's not worth it. even if you do, so few people can lvl this fast that you won't have a ton of people to play with nor your irl friends.  
---
take it easy, focus on IRL friends
---
Then it takes me 32s in mats to make a 30s Silk Pack
---
Surely you’re better to leave there renew until after the last smite
---
Anybody know how I can heal in Deadmines without running out of mana so much?  I wish I could find a low-level healing guide online.  
---
But we barely made it through using Lesser Heal and Renew, I wish I knew which rank to use, or what spells are the most efficient, because I feel like there's just so many variables to consider, and not many options to practice.
---
You literally described all of reddit.
---
Well true but dire maul is not out yet plus what was it called before dire maul came out.
---
I've 100% noticed this but am not nearly informed enough to say "this isn't working properly". Glad to know it's seemingly happening for others because I was under the impression that it was a flat 20 energy regen each tick.
---
Side note, can we get a full view of your UI? I love the simplicity and it's been nearly a decade since I've messed with UI addons.
---
Rag looks pretty good on modern PCs
---
I was a little skeptical because I really wanted to run dungeons with my IRL friends. With our busy schedules it was tough for all of us to stay close to the same levels or even be on at the same time. Last night we finally ran WC as a full group and it was the most fun I had in a long time on WoW. Will definitely be sticking around for the long haul
---
&gt; Why are you so concerned about the way other people are playing?
---
Because it is an MMO, where grouping with other people is required/encouraged for some content that offers great rewards and XP.
---
Meh nostalgia only be over in a week.
---
LMAO!!! Best joke of all time!!! or truer words never spoken from from the clueless.
---
I'm doing solo priest now, it's not so bad and I don't miss having to drink after every couple mobs like I did on my mage.
---
But another option is druid. They seem like strong solo levelers and you'll have the option to effectively heal or tank dungeons.
---
I too am having a great time
---
this is hilarious
---
screenshot gatekeeping is getting absolutely neckbeard levels of ridiculous
---
Hahaha
---
Good luck friend :)
---
Prot pally in BC wss my jam! Pulled absolutely everything all the time and never died. Then I got that "blocking gives you hp" trinket and the world was my oyster. AoE farm for days!
---
Duskwood, Winterspring, Felwood, EPL, and WPL are my favorite zones. Darkshore gets an honorable mention.
---
No fucking kidding. Fuck those guys lol
---
You reminded me of this pre hotting threat guide that's not bad 
---
https://youtu.be/pQqgcm82IFE
---
TL,DW; pre hotting in the open world is okay, pre hotting in dungeons isn't unless you're unreasonably far away
---
So for a tank warrior would be best then?
---
This is a good resource and lists the attack speed of most pets:
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
I keep switching between Classic graphics and recommended graphics for my system (around 7 or 8 on the scale). I'm never sure which I like better.
---
Ugh
---
lmao no, fuck streamers
---
Toxic players will always be around, retail, private, or classic.  You just don't see it as much in retail wow because there is no reason to interact with each other at all.
---
AdolfCritler too
---
Blue is poo!
---
I told my warrior guildy that I'd help him get we axe tonight.  Gonna talk my priest friend into helping with cyclonian
---
Your party needs Threadmeter as well for it to work. Unless you're playing with a premade team and convince everyone to install it, changes are slim it'll work with randoms.
---
Level 14 and enjoying my slow enjoyment of wandering through Azeroth once more!
---
Post a combat clip! :D
---
As a bear tank, I tell priests feel free to shield me if need be. It seems I get more than enough rage from primal fury.
---
It's not that hard to do a full clear though lol.
---
Man i've spent half my playtime at the auction house, time flies!
---
Very semi indeed.
---
dae read quest text?
---
Sync for Reddit IMO is better on Android
---
Its just extremely inefficient
---
The game doesn't even start until 60 if you've ever played. It just means once you get higher and have your mount people will already have their epic mount. Be farming all her herbs and veins and now allow you to get side skills up, then not enjoy raiding because you'll have ass gear and people will just kick you for greens.
---
If you're going slow, build all your secondary skills so you're not walking on your feet and poor as fuck
---
Why should someone naming themselves "holocaust" upset any rational person? It's not like they named themselves "Hitler did nothing wrong" or are inherently going to be racist/offensive in behavior. Honestly, why do people think that something as silly as a character name should be policed so heavily? My friend was named "Satanist" and also got a 24hr suspension. Seems ludicrous to me.
---
So true! So good!!
---
I’d rather spend 2 weeks playing a video game and being done with it than spending months to accomplish the same thing.
---
I needed to read this ov been flat out on it to hit 60 for some unknown stupid reason
---
The map adding track node spawns it has observed and guess locations, they are neither precise nor complete. There is probably an addon for skinable mobs to show up similarly, but be prepared for your minimap to be very cluttered
---
As a lock, if I have near 0% mana and 100% health I will lifetap until both are around 50% and then eat and drink to make the downtime shorter. If that is the case, don't worry about healing the warlock at that point.
---
&gt; Never renew ANYONE before a pull. Don’t drink water or eat food during either. All of this causes Agro! I’ve seen raids wipe on pulls because someone was drinking!
---
I thought you were making a JOKE when you said this
---
lucky you my GF buys into the "WoW is for turbo nerds who don't shower" crap so she'd never play it.
---
I'm level 13 lol
---
As someone who played a rogue to 60 on a PvP server in Vanilla, definitely take the time to get Thiele tea. It will save your butt in a pinch.
---
Perfect. This has been dominating my thoughts in life (lol) and this helps a lot. TY my friend.
---
Needs more jpeg
---
Yup, I tamed Mazzranache on my troll, she matches my pink mohawk and is named Floyd.  I'm going to try to make it so she's the only pet I use for the majority of game play ... even if she's not the best choice of pet.
---
More gold at 60 is fine.  This pet sells for hundreds of gold later in the game.

It's the same for any hybrids. At least boomkins used to get raid spots - mostly taken for the spell crit aura, innervate, rebirth and decursing.
---
I couldn't do this at all. I'm thankful to work in the woods and far far away from my computer desk. Stay strong friend
---
I have to admit you handle these actual neckbeards pretty well. Kudos to you brother. Keep up the funny names, I personally can't get into using funny names but do you. WoW is a video game and I don't think people realize that. Classic wow is bringing a lot of the older crowd back into the game, and if they're offended by some animetiddies or they're really that into the game where they lose immersion seeing a name like that and don't have enough control to forget about it.. well I feel bad for them
---
Aspect of the cheetah either at or just under 20

I'm sure you will love running the same raids weekly for years
---
WoW noob here (lvl13). I picked up Tailoring and enchanting on my priest. Enchanting is only at lvl 7 atm. I have a lesser wand but saw that you also get better wands via quests later as an alternative to crafting.
---
Is it worth it to level up enchanting while leveling? I was thinking of dropping it for skinning to get more gold on the way and pick it back up at 60.
---
I’m a resto Druid main. It is perfectly acceptable to wear cloth armor. It usually has the best stats for intellect and spirit.
---
Cumgrgl could be a murloc name tbh.
---
The sword is good too.
---
The difference is the damage range and speed. You'll hit a little harder with Overpower and Mortal Strike using the axe. Also consider axe spec gives 5% crit while sword spec gives chance for an extra attack. And if you are 2h fury the sword is better period.
---
I'll renew life tapping locks if it won't cause me 5 second regen problems. You can eat too and get back in the fight faster.
---
I enjoy getting upgrades and working the AH, while questing in different areas and seeing them all. Doing each dungeon once or twice then moving in to the next one.
---
I'm 52 years old, and everyone I know well enough to get questioned, "What did you do over the weekend?" either is a gamer (in some great or small way) or was a gamer. So me saying, "I played WoW all weekend," wouldn't shock anyone. (Some may not know "WoW", but they'd at least recognize "World of Warcraft".)
---
I work in a professional environment -- office building where everyone has their own personal office -- with scientists, engineers, software developers, and other degreed professionals. I'd estimate that half of them are regular gamers (in some great or small way), and I wouldn't be surprised if 90% have been regular gamers at some point during their life. I hear a game referenced nearly every day around the office. I'd also expect half of the current gamers probably know that WoW just released Classic. I bet I could poll a random meeting of 10 people and find at least one other person who is at least trying WoW Classic.
---
I've never hidden my gaming hobby (even when it was table-top D&amp;D), and I've never gotten any weirdness due to being open about it. (I don't usually bring up the subject with new people, but sometimes a new person will see something on or around me that reveals my gaming interests.) So I'm rather surprised that some people feel a need to hide their completely common pastime from people around them.
---
So does it stream to your phone from your PC?
---
How do you know?
---
With more words, a bank alt is a character often level 1 with bank full of storage (you could even create a guild for the sole purpose of using the guild bank entirely for your items).
---
It’s also a good practice to use that character to make auctions.

Where my bois at that never came to a firm decision on what they wanted to main and are now working on their 3rd reroll in the last week?

Charge, defensive, demo shout. Works every time. Then just tab sunder/revenge, rince repeat
---
Why would we change your mind? You're a big boy, you're allowed your own opinions.
---
From the perspective of the Blizzard Launcher being a *shop*, they *are* the same. You don't subscribe to classic. You're subscribed to BfA and getting classic as a bonus. It would make about as much sense as giving Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void separate tabs.
---
I'm not saying it was originally the correct way to handle these names, but now it is. I don't know why Deadmines was picked to change, but now there's an alternate name for Deadmines and not one for Dire Maul, so Dire Maul gets DM.
---
back in vanilla i had a dwarf paladin as my first toon. I was in westfall i think for the mount quest or something, long time ago i forget. 
---
I ran into another paladin, a human. Ndnmarty, i'll never forget this dudes name. 
---
We quested for probably 10 hours straight. 
---
we got our mounts together, all of that, it was insane. I hope these things keep happening and they don't do anything to jeopardize it again.
---
another super minor difference that makes taurens better tanks is that they can actually hit things farther out from their hitbox than orcs can. This means when a mob is moving from fear or aggro you might get a swing in that an orc wouldn't. This was why in my vanilla guild one guys mantra was "Orcs have short arms"
---
There are plenty of people sitting in an inn and moving their mouse or keys every few mins.. this is still afk.
---
Honestly there wouldn't be queues if people weren't doing this
---
Agreed, a lot of the other posts seem like they are trying to publicly justify their selves for not being included or something because they cant (cringe). Whatever, to each their own.
---
Bro I want to watch the progression, what’s your twitch??
---
&gt;Then in rfk after struggling with potato group giving me no time corpse maker dropped and a warlock needed on it to sell for gold.
---
holy fuck I'm getting third party PTSD from this. I would've blacklisted too.
---
You are correct
---
A few things:
---
1. If you're the healer, there should be no expectation for you to do damage in the group, exactly to avoid this threat situation. If the group needs you to do damage in order to clear, something is wrong. While you certainly can wand for damage, it's more efficient for the tank to just pull faster and let the DPS fill their roles.
---
2. Downranking at low levels is actually less efficient due to the lack of spell power, the abundance of spirit and the five second rule. You're better off casting you high rank large heal (best HP/mana) once and then letting regeneration kick in than successive smaller spells w/o regeneration. Just communicate to the tank that they may not always be topped off, so the don't panic and you're good. Unlike raid tanking where the tank could get crushed, crits and crushes won't 1 or 2 shot your tank in 5 mans and obviously overhealing isn't efficient.
---
3. Just like warrior tanks don't need to be Prot to tank at low levels, you don't need to be holy to heal. Shadow, Spirit tap in particular is excellent for healing, again because of Vanilla itemization of spirit on just about everything.
---
4. Which brings me to the 2 situations where you SHOULD wand, to get a killing blow to activate spirit tap and if a paladin has judged Wisdom on the mob and you can get mana back.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Really p2w shitty ass devs....
---
I was more speaking generally about how some people think "If you don't enjoy the game the same way I do, then you're ruining it."
---
I use https://moonlight-stream.org/
---
Great open source option, minimal lag. Gotta have at least 10mbps upload for a decent experience
---
Is this Empire on Incendius?
---
asmonBALD 
---
"Its just as hard as I remember, these instant dungeon groups, people clamoring to send me gold just to get on stream, free items at the end of every encounter being donated to me? This is Vanilla all over again"
---
I say this every time in every dungeon.  “Give me time to get threat” does not mean wait until the mobs hit me.  I need to hit them and god forbid I miss that first attack. 
---
Also DPS please stop following me when I pull.  I can assure you you won’t lose DPS waiting around the corner with the healer.
---
No problem, I also only meant cause I'm interested and you might get more help haha.
---
No but losing threat on a stunned or rooted mob is pretty much best case scenario. Easy enough to make them sit for a sec while you build some.
---
Textbook denial. I hope you get the help you need.
---
Does anyone actually spend more than 30 seconds looking at the launcher? Just play the game you've been waiting so long for.
---
It’s fine as long as you inform them that’s what you’re going to do. Can offer some silver too if needed.
---
The trick isn't to clear a zone of all quests. Do the starting quests and after the turn-ins and follow-ups that are red, go to a different zone. Intro Westfall quests -&gt; Loch Modan intro -&gt; Darkshore intro -&gt; back to Westfall for the later quests -&gt; later Redridge -&gt; later Darkshore, etc.  
---
No, that loop probably isn't the best, but you get my point.
---
I never played classic (Started in Draenor and have played on and off), but I am really enjoying every minute of playing and taking my time and just finding quests to do that are level appropriate.
---
Currently level 23 as a warlock (although my damn Voidwalker needs to hold aggro better) I just respeced to put points into improved voidwalker and next level he will get AoE taunt so hope it works better.
---
Nope- just be up front about it and you'll be just fine.
---
Toxicity was always in wow, I dunno why people keep saying private servers this and that etc.
---
What this guy did is in no way any kind of proof that he's from a private server.
---
Let me tell you a story about vanilla wow....
---
One time I was playing on a PVP server when the game first launched leveling an alliance Hunter.
---
The game was going great until I got to wetlands outside of ironforge.....   I ran into a level ??? Horde player and the dude killed me.
---
No big deal I ran back.  But even though I spawn far from my body one of his buddies killed me.
---
I did this about 15 or 20 times before I said screw it I'm going to raise the graveyard....
---
When I reset the graveyard there was a bunch of hoard standing there and they killed me again.
---
For a good hour or two hours I spent trying to res and could not....
---
So I ran all the way across to the other side of the zone to the other graveyard....
---
And there was horde there too and they killed me again....
---
I burnt half a day just trying to get my character to come back to life.  and it got to the point where I was waiting on Res timers for ridiculous amounts of time...
---
Eventually I gave up completely and I ran to a graveyard three zones away and I was able to res there.   Then I stayed out of wetlands....
---
Not on my server. I struggle to find any.
---
The Chinese are already hard at work
---
Gaymer chairs and junk food :/
---
Nope I didn’t go to a sub to shit on them, I was reading the post and he said how easy Classic was, and I just said bfa you can get to 120 in a few days easily
---
Riposte is a move that you can only use when you parry an enemy attack so you actually do more damage while getting attacked. Was just making a joke lol.
---
Well, Battle has a long timer, if you dont need to renew it or it's not beneficial as per rage spent vs threat gained as it requires party members to be around you to gain their value, then its better to drop an extra Sunder if the buff is already active.
---
I would also say that if you're rolling with multiple warriors, you work out who is doing what and who is spec'd improved BS.
---
I tank in arms pre lvl 50 though.
---
If you learned a low level ability, like level 2 Claw, do you have to go tame a pet that has Claw 3 to upgrade, or will the fact that you already have Claw 2 let you get all the upgrade for it?
---
My friend made a Dwarf last night names Michelleobam. Imagine a man with a deep voice going around speaking in a Scottish accent about the animals we are killing not getting school lunches.
---
Yet those who do literally nothing would judge you hard
---
Would be playing Arms for leveling for sure, so it sounds like the Axe is always the go to weapon. Thanks!
---
I think the photo had the effect he was looking for maybe.
---
I wish I could play that much.
---
I’m not in that guild, but ya. Incendius
---
Shouts absolutely do generate threat
---
I don’t think so, personally whenever I sign a guild charter I’m fully expecting to /gquit as soon as it’s formed.
---
 Forward slash "played"
---
i work overnights by myself and i bring my laptop and play at work for 12 hours straight 6p-6a lol
---
Well there's a lot more healing classes then tanking classes so it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.
---
That totally makes sense and is fair, lol
---
This is enforced by reporting, I assume?
---
I'm around level 10 with 4 different characters lol
---
Made an old looking dwarf named grandpaladin
---
I got a 3 day ban for Dildoh /: I feel you bro. I wish they had just given us a name change instead of these suspensions. 
---
What made it worse was I had just hit level 20 and spent two hours forming a group and running to deadmines, only to get the ban hammer right when I entered the dungeon.
---
Ah, that makes sense. Axe it is then! Thanks!
---
I'm so absolute garbage at making money in wow. I'm definitely a poor sucker :(
---
That is called burned out. Play something else for a day or two
---
Obviously there is a huge difference between "mandatory" and "encouraged". 
---
I used to play Vanilla mainly solo, because I just didn't care much for social interaction at the time. Even then there would emerge situations where I would socialise with people, be it for dungeon runs or just by chance while questing. 
---
The main reason people don't interact in Live is not that there's little to no necessity, but because Blizzard has managed to convey one very clear message over the years:   
---
"Nothing Matters. This is not a world to exist in. This is a skinner box to stimulate your little brains."  
---
I even went and found a guild, hoping to find some people to talk to and play with that way. Forget about it - mostly it's doing some M+ dungeons (which I'm not interested in) and then everyone logs off. There is just NOTHING to care about anymore, save for getting that one achievement or farming for that last rare mount for your collection. All motivation is extrinsic, so why bother interacting with the world and its players more than is necessary?
---
Yeah, agreed. It's not a big enough deal it should even be a conversation.
---
Lol yeah those are all pretty bad. I'm surprised that Blizz lets 'cum' through.
---
just hit 20 on my warrior. Send help pls.
---
Jesus Christ, are you that starved of social interaction you have to nitpick details from 14 years ago that don't matter?
---
You’re going to have some profound revelations about how you communicate with people in the future. It’s gonna be a healthy growing process. Hang in there man. Life can be shit sometimes, but in a sea of things you can’t control, you can control the way you speak to people and vibe you put out into the world. Keep doing your incel bit. It’s quite harmless, but there are better ways to operate. You’ll figure it out.
---
that's all on blizz for allowing it. they got lazy and it allowed retail to fester
---
they used to stay on top of that shit but they tried to automate all these human responsibilities and it just hasn't worked. report has become a weapon and all the other changes made it pointless to ignore people
---
they can come up with a better solution to how the community acts in "public" on chat channels. what goes on in parties/raids/guilds can be left alone until it's pure harrassment but they never should have gotten lazy in wotlk when it came to snuffing out toxicity
---
Recommendation for an auction add on?
---
People are so concerned with XP/hr they're probably not grouping for dungeons with rando's and instead just questing, especially at low lvls.
---
Good ol' Classic amirite?
---
You can take the player out of retail, but can't take the retail out of the player lol.
---
That's how it should work. They didn't change that aspect till tbc I think.
---
Good video, thanks!
---
That looks like some sort of nameplate castbar, do you not have one dedicated for your target?
---
I am level 34 and ran most of the dungeons on my way to current level.  Every DPS has pretty much treated this like current WoW and not Classic, its been fun using taunt on CD constantly haha.
---
Guilds work best...  
---
I did 3 Deadmines and 2 Stockades runs in about 5 hours last night just because guild folks (Level 29-31) were taking a few of us (low to mid 20s) with them.  Larger guilds you'll be able to find a lot of people at your level to dungeon with - smaller guilds the levels are spread a little more so you might get a higher up to help on the run through.
---
You guys are freaking sad.
---
Yeah seems like everyone is stating that as well, looks like it will be the axe for me. Thanks!
---
*screen shot*
---
But you're a Shaman
---
Just let them know beforehand to be safe. I often sign for people and expect to be kicked since Im just helping in the formation. If Im not kicked I will gquit soon.
---
I am keeping an eager eye on this addon. This is like the FFXI bazaar feature!
---
...I  can stop any time I want! I just don't want to... Ever...
---
ah that makes it a bit easier because they're all the same timezone. Some of the EU servers have been co-opted by other language speakers that didn't get dedicated servers so just be careful you don't end up on one with 90% German speakers or something.
---
You don't need prot until the 55-60 instances.  Just go defensive stance and you are good to go.
---
Badlands ogres maybe
---
Thanks dude, this helps! I like the setup, it looks really clean
---
You get 2% Dodge from 40 agi. Granted, that's also 2% crit. So itemization wise, this is like 20 ago of stat worth. The fact that these have base ago as well gives more Dodge and crit as well.
---
It's just natural opposition to the "if you don't play my way, you're a noob/bad" circlejerk. :)
---
Garrisons.
---
Yea, no kidding. Like I have to raid with that name. People call me by it.
---
Your standard shouldn't be so binary though...(as a druid healer myself) you should be focused on dungeon/raid efficiency.  If you're not struggling with mana keeping the tank alive, toss a HoT to the lock to speed up dps.  If you're struggling, then sure...leave the lock to their own devices, you have a higher priority. 
---
But if your mana is staying above 60% the entire time, you can afford to toss a rejuv on the lock to speed things up.
---
Oh my bad. I thought it was a CD for getting rid of threat!
---
To put it simply, there's little place for actual tragedies to be in a fantasy game. It's just not worth the tradeoff, since offensive names are rarely witty, funny or immersive.
---
AGI and STA are great for warriors, as long as you have decent STR from other gear.
---
I admire the dedication. Moved over to Bigglesworth with some friends and its not too bad, minus the 5pm rush.
---
I’m lvling hybrid prot. Got my rage stance dance talent maxed then went down prot.    My healers love me and last stand has saved many over pull wipes. Yes you can level 2h but prot leveling is fine with a group. I’m in my late 30s now and I feel like a god in 5 mans. By the time I’m in my 40s I’ll have all the threat and rage talents and I will be pulling rooms.
---
Definitely gets worse later. I was farming Scarlet Monastery (I’m a tank) and some of the groups I found were just the worst. Maybe it’s my warrior tank mind set but DPS warriors always screw shit up, they over pull are constantly taunting, thusly pulling aggro away from me intentionally and it’s just bad. Granted I don’t have issues finding groups, I say Tank LF (insert dungeon here) and I get invites almost immediately. Or I just look in chats and see people LF tank and I whisper them and get added. Whether or not the yo-yo is good is always a gamble, but I don’t leave or quit on people unless they completely are hopeless (won’t listen to instructions, keep pulling and won’t let me generate threat) or if they harass me relentlessly. I do feel for DPS looking for groups, but at that point it’s better to befriend a tank or healer and ride their coattails.
---
I ask for 1 silver to sign
---
Alchemy and herbalism, plan on focusing more to heal later. My mate that I level with who is a warlock makes fun of me for stopping out of a sudden from leveling just for some herbs 400m away 
---
I also enjoy reviving people, it feels good lol
---
Haven't played WoW in a year. Have 3 stacked WoW tokens in my account. 
---
If I activate a token and get 30 days playtime, can I play Classic?
---
You think the average is that high already? I’ve been playing since release and I’m only 23 due to having responsibilities, etc. There are a few people in my guild who have been playing a lot and are barely over 40. I must be further behind than I thought haha.
---
The built in questing addition wasn't added until the very end of Wotlk, the very expansion that many people think of as the one that killed WoW.
---
So I would say it's pretty immersion breaking. You go from being an adventurer figuring out your journey (no addon) to a guy subconsciously following what's basically a pre-determined path (addon).
---
Not sure where this sentiment comes from, I hit like a truck. Regularly killing stuff within a second or so on my pala at level 31.
---
I had to install Questie, but that was it. I was worried I was going to miss out on lore by not catching quests. I love it.
---
Another 0.7% dodge and 0.7% crit from that 15 ago as well.
---
Dire Bear at 40 is so OP i love it.
---
It's like they don't realize people did this back in 2005 as well.  Hell I remember nefarion was killed before blizz even had his loot table worked out because blizz didn't expect players to make it that far so quickly.
---
Less ambiguity is always easier. Cheers
---
Boar cuz boar.
---
Turtle cuz turtle.
---
Its all you need.
---
Searing gorge/steppes (can never remember which is which) is good for thorium brotherhood rep if you’re taking crafting seriously.
---
Shit like this is what excites me when i start leveling alchemy. Prolly ganna do it tonight and tomorrow
---
Was going to say this.
---
Staff is nice, but will always be around. These boots should be *way* more valuable. Could probably sell them and then buy the staff of someone and still have gold to spare.
---
I believe that opening new servers are not the correct answer.   
---
Most players won't stay after 2 months and players will end with dead servers.   
---
A well thought the process of Server transfers and latter server migrations will be required to stabilize this situation that was raised by only creating a handful of servers within the release of the name reservation.
---
I don't mind soloing as priest since the wand spec generally keeps you topped off on mana so there is no downtime since you are always getting the killing blow. Leveling with a rogue or Warr is better but solo is surprisingly not terrible.
---
Cmon buddy, let's see it.
---
Try before work! That's when I got mine in Vanilla after fruitless days of evening camping.
---
Enchanting is expensive and not that great when you're first starting out. I'd highly recommend Herbalism to go with the Alchemy or even just two gathering professions until you have a more steady gold flow.
---
Not at all. I've made a tidy sum over the years joining guilds that then kicked me after I signed.
---
Yeah I dont think they see the hypocrisy. If youre not worried about other peoples experience of just wanting to level, why should they worry about your experience of enjoying the lore
---
You can do that. By creating a character on a lower population server.
---
Enjoy the ride man. It definitely probably made the grind more fun, and easier decimating everything. You’ll make that money you would have on that weapon in time.
---
I'm still finding what to play I lvled up my rog to 20 now i want to play other class.
---
Make sure you upgrade your weapon every chance you get. Research your next weapon upgrade.
---
Demo shout is your friend. Start the fight with one of those and you'll be reducing the mob's melee damage by 15-30 percent depending on how recently you got your latest rank of demo shout.
---
Also, some warriors swear by stacking spirit for leveling, even above strength. Warriors get a lot of HP Regen from spirit so it really helps with reducing your down time. [This video has some nice raw footage of it in action.](https://youtu.be/LDTE2o79lgg). Worth noting that he's using the troll's blood potion and armor potion. Also, Trolls get 10% HP Regen in combat and an additional 10% out of combat.
---
I did not know this sub was about the game WoW. I just saw it on r/popular and clicked on it. I found it a really cool philosophical way of thinking until I saw the comments.
---
elvui, I've not tested it yet, but looks like they have fixed the buff duration and enemy cast bar issues
---
Back in wraith I used a threat meter that changed the size of the nameplate to larger and larger the less threat I had on that individual mob so it very obvious who I didnt have threat on. Dows that still exist? Itd be very helpful in vanilla.
---
Same for me, was using level 19 2h at level 20, switched to duel's and started shredding mobs. Its odd, I expected different.
---
Yeah as soon as i went home i was in a queue so i got mega rekt
---
I blew a big old leveling load this weekend. Got to 35. Now its time to kick back and coast to 60 for another 100+ hours.
---
Not in game. You still ha e a blizzard account, you can create a ticket thru their website.
---
Classic isn't really about a good game as it is about the community. It was groundbreaking at the time, but grew tedious to play. But its crazy what community of people will deal with just to hangout with each other.
---
yeah that’s why I prefer Codex the most. AAP has a literal arrow pointing you around
---
I just use Codex and Questie to have little markers on the map so I know where to go to kill mobs when needed
---
Edgy
---
Not rushing at all, just hit 25 last night. Finally got done questing in Redridge, logged off in Duskwood with a fresh stack of quests to do when I get home from work today. 
---
The world feels **so big.** Hubs are far apart, traveling takes time, and there are real, actual dangers that could end with you doing a death run all the way across a zone. I can't get over how beautiful everything is, just like I remember it. 
---
The impromptu "hey it looks like we're killing the same mobs" groups are fantastic, everyone is helping each other. Folks go out of their way to save others who pull too many mobs, they share chest loot and rare spawns. 
---
This is exactly what I fell in love with all those years ago. It feels like we're all adventurers in a dangerous new world. I'm absolutely taking my time.
---
I've never played wow before but when I get a job 
---
I'm def trying this. I love these grindy games
---
Same with me but I played through WOD. My luck on world drops is not good.
---
Hi, /u/vinsjuhnl
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cz74ct/got_in_800_queue_12_minutes_on_mograine_every/). 
---
Can I ask, I tried it out two nights ago to see how it compared to what I was using and nothing showed up. It was installed and it was the correct version but no unit frames showed up, not even the blizz ones. Have you seen this issue before? When I did the /suf I think it was, I saw all the options but no frames on the screen
---
Fuck if I know. I do not speak moonspeak.
---
Sounds like you need a pocket mage. We’re the best vending machines.
---
The "go slow" people are actually a lot more annoying than the speedybois. I don't see any posts on any forums saying "Wow y'all are slow I can't believe how slow you are" but I've seen probably about 10 posts like this one.
---
Yes.  You can macro hunters mark, pet attack, and your own autoattack all on the same macro.
---
Have you considered consulting a local doctor? Or maybe just checking to see if your balls are still there?
---
Maybe, but bfa is the whole fkin landfill.
---
They’re good but probably the most gear dependent class in the game. So early on they’re probably the worst.
---
You should set it to a few frames lower. For example if your G-Sync suppports up to 165Hz then lock it at around 160Hz.
---
Someone in my guild fell for the ole alt+f4 trick the other day haha. He also spent two hours trying to get a hunter pet as a shammy. New people are the greatest
---
Sorry I don't speak elvish
---
that sounds like terrible experience for tank tho. Why even bring tank and not another mage/warlock in this case.
---
I know your probably just making a funny, but I'm gonna throw it out there anyways. If you are spending more evenings than not consuming 4+ alcoholic beverages and playing video games I strongly encourage anyone in that situation to reconsider. I've had several friends fall into a deep depression that started with boozey gaming sessions, and even one very close friend pass away from alcohol withdrawal when he tried to fix it.
---
If you were curious, you could ask. I am just defending the people I think you're shitting on, so it's not like I'm a horrible person you couldn't understand if you wanted to.
---
It's one thing to post a funny picture then say, "hey, by the way guys, this is how you take a screenshot if you don't know how." It pushes an entirely different message to post the picture and then in the comments go, "please stop taking pictures of your desktop," "I don't understand why you would even do that," "it's so easy to do it this way." The step-by-step instructions then just come off extremely patronizing instead of helpful.
---
Look man, at the end of the day, you posted your opinion and I posted mine. I respect your opinion and I even mentioned I also screenshot and record through my computer. You seem to want to act like a deer in headlights that someone would call you out for being kinda shitty about the way you are putting out your opinion. 
---
If that's how it's going to go, then so be it. I'm personally just tired of the elitism surrounding this and many other topics. Maybe that's just a sign I should hop off Reddit though.
---
God damn I needed this. This is 100% me. I'm so freaken happy that there are people out there who get it. Strength and honor friend.
---
That is real bad. I wonder why they felt the need to nerf this niche and if it even was a 'bug'
---
Somethings gotta give between the work, family, and sleep.  Personally,  I cut back the influence of two of those three factors on my life in the weeks leading up to classic launch
---
some people want to reach 60 as fast as possible because they, like many other, find that the true game lies in the endgame. so fuck off and stop telling people how to play the game.
---
If your gear gets better, yeah
---
Loving my wind serpent!
---
If people rush to 60 then that means the AH will be full of lower level gear at a decent price since everyone wants the higher stuff.
---
I hit 30 on my druid ln, you’ll get there, feels gooood
---
I mean my main goal is to hit 60 so I can go camp  all the lowbies still leveling in STVietnam.
---
Engineering is meant be a money sink. If you are blowing money trying to level it youre going to end up not having money for a mount
---
I personally like to revive players that die near me or even just find their corpse laying on the ground. They are usually very happy that a random player saved them the walk of shame back to their body!
---
I don’t mind healing them if it’s out of combat when there’s downtime.
---
Not in the middle of a pull...... (which is what happened to me last night)
---
Warriors become fun when you learn to love the sight of your enemies blood dripping from your blade.
---
Mocking blow.
---
I'm incredibly slow at leveling, not only because I'm solo priest, but this is my first time experiencing Classic. So far, over 30 hours and only level 21.
---
That is the only reason I haven't rolled another toon. I don't want to do that again lol
---
My friends made characters, I chose Priest because I like healing and Priest was my fave class when I first played seriously during cata. 
---
My friend chose Warrior. Now I see that instead of Priest, I have chosen, "questing baby sitter"
---
Atm I’m just using whatever the highest 2h sword I can find is. In classic am I still choosing weps in terms of dps or are there some unique stats of dungeon weapons that make them better choices. Like the whirlwind axe I keep hearing everyone talk about for example, is that good just because of a solid dps rating or are there other factors.
---
what's wrong with holocaust or animetiddies? I'm so glad I never spent a second in WoW. I'm here cuz my friends are begging me to join in on the raiding good times. I just could never bring myself to sign up back then, &amp; seeing that Blizzard GMs are still raging fascists, I'm glad I didn't give into their hype train of getting to experience what I INTENTIONALLY MISSED (cuz FF11&lt;WoW) in high school.
---
Even as a "streamer" myself, I don't know why people are carrying him.
---
With all the time in the world, he can be leveling as we speak. I will have to wait til 5 to be home and wait in queue for roughly a hour. :(
---
You are looking for total auctions listed on either side. You might not have the tools to limit by unique seller so a guesstimate may be the best you can manage for now.
---
Idk I played day 1 and 2 when there were maxed out starter zones and we had no problem doing looting quests. They just took forever. But wow classic isn't meant to be a race. During vanilla servers were focused on progressing together, not individually. 
---
What you're meaning to say is looting quests will take you an hour or more to complete which is fine. It forces people to group up, socialize and work together. Forced socialization is something that made wow vanilla great and should be a 100% necessary aspect of wow classic.
---
It got easier for me at lvl 20 and way easier with execute.
---
I still have to be careful but I can do several monster in a row without downtime and except on some occasion where I am like " no way i can miss 5 normal hit in a row that's like 15s of not doing any damage"
---
But overall, I think I overestimated how hard it will be
---
Even more so! The sence of wonder truly is back! Seeing all these places and going "Oooohhh I remember that!" Is wonderful and I am having a blast making new friends and overcoming these new (old) challenges!
---
Ya blew it
---
I’ll never forget seeing your name in trade chat
---
I meant dungeons -- I don't need to worry about aggro when I'm solo wanding. (And I don't trust myself or any party members yet to squeeze in wand snipes)
---
I was in a guild with someone with that exact name, but they used an accented capital A to get around the text filter.
---
At the time Classic launched, there was no real reason to rush to 60... the game was new, the content needed to be explored. Times changed unfortunately... and it seems, Classic was launched at a really good point to show people that it is not about rushing, not about getting to the end as fast as possible - but to enjoy the ride! And it is awesome... for me personally, I have to kinda learn to enjoy again, and not care about how long it takes to farm 6 moss from stupid swamp monsters :)
---
Are you on Kromcrush? I saw the same thing and was wondering how long or if they even cared enough.
---
Well, 
---
* Flying was super well received by the whole community.
---
* Item power inflation was super well received by the whole community when it came with TBC. 
---
* PvP Arenas were super well received by the community when it came in TBC. 
---
* The focus on raids in TBC was very well received.
---
* The improvement to hybrid roles as healer/tank in TBC was demanded.
---
* The introduction of repeatable solo content in TBC was demanded in response to a lack of solo content in classic. 
---
* Dual Spec was demanded (in response to the solidification of tank/healer roles, and the high power inflation of gear) in Wrath.
---
* The ability to spam dungeons became important due to gear power inflation and the importance of raid content by Wrath and encouraged the creation of the dungeon finder.
---
* The focus on end-game content created multiple tiers of difficulty for Raids in Wrath as people who couldn't raid were otherwise left out of the majority of the focus of the game. 
---
* The strong response to more story-driven content greatly shifted the solo quest direction towards more 'hero of the world' type story from 'footman collecting bear asses' type story.  This also came with the addition of phasing to let players see the changes they made to the world.  The story in Wrath was very well received because of this.
---
* The strong response to Wrath's content and a constant nagging playerbase who wanted to fly in classic led to Cataclysm's rewrite of the entire old world. 
---
Pretty much all of these things were nearly universally praised or demanded. 
---
There's a constant pressure to make things more convenient, then to make things more difficult, then to make things more accessible, and then it repeats.  Like WoW classic raiding had convenience issues: you needed to farm shit, you needed to get rep, you needed to attune to raids.  Most raid content wasn't that hard, I was in a guild whose members would fall asleep at the keyboard, who didn't know wtf they were doing, who were actually quite bad at the game, and we killed Ragnaros not long after BWL released, we killed Nefarian before AQ40 opened, we killed up to twin Emps by the time Naxx had released, and we got to four horsemen by the time TBC came out. People were not happy about the sheer difficulty of maintaining a 40 man roster so raid sizes dropped to 25. 
---
Then the demand was to remove attunement requirements.  We had attuned to SSC and TK by the time they dropped them, and we cleared that, and we cleared BT.  But the ease of getting into BT meant that tons of people were getting through it now and it seemed too easy and we wanted something really rewarding, so Sunwell was made numerically/technically challenging. 
---
By the time Wrath came out, people decided that it wasn't right for so much story to be put in something that was so challenging, so accessibility again, they put in 10 man versions of the raids to allow people to experience it (but with uglier gear and lower stats).  But then with these things being accessible, more casual players wanted to do the content but they might come back and nobody would want to go back and gear them up again, so they updated the badge system to let you get previous tier gear from badges.  (Again to convenience).  Then with the release of Cataclysm, there was a mounting desire to make the game challenging again like it used to be. So they ramped up the difficulty of raids and dungeons in Cataclysm. 
---
This cycle continues to repeat.
---
And even in classic, I see these demands starting.  For convenience, people are starting to complain about the quest log limit, I see people asking why the meeting stones aren't working. People immediately clamored for more difficult raids as soon as APES killed MC.  If the game got more convenient, say Naxx attunement was removed, Naxx would get cleared day 1 of it's release, which would cause people to demand that it be made harder, which would cause people to demand that it become more accessible. 
---
The real issue is that a big part of the classic experience is stuff that people find annoying. Annoying things are impediments to be overcome that sometimes require social coordination, but rarely require player skill.  A class that has a lot of downtime when soloing or a quest that is hard to solo because the pulls are too big is annoying, not challenging.  But if you group with a friend, you can remove that annoyance. 
---
People generally feel justified in removing annoying things.  Remove the downtime from the class, make quests something you can solo in a reasonable timeframe without frustrating deaths. 
---
Removing the annoying things leads to a lack of obstacles to overcome.  People feel this as being "too easy" so ask for the content to be harder. When you make content harder, it now generally rewards players that have good gear or more skill.  Where previously the content rewarded players who could endure discomfort. 
---
When the content is made harder now becomes something that a less skilled or more poorly geared player can't complete.  While before they could take it slow, now they simply can't finish it reliably.  So now they ask for it to be made more accessible. 
---
Now that the content is more accessible, the challenges become things like coordinating a group instead of defeating the content, so people ask to remove that inconvenience, because they feel the challenge should be in the game, not in the process of getting people together.  Again, asking for convenience.  
---
But once they can easily get the groups together, they realize how easy the content actually is, and demand that the content be made harder because they are bored and want a challenge.  Then when it gets made harder than they can reliably handle they want something that they can do. Then when they get something that they can do, they want an easier time getting to do that content, then it is too easy and they want something harder.  etc. 
---
The thing about vanilla WoW is that they haven't yet started to remove the inconveniences. A lot of the challenges are social challenges. Like, you could do the dungeon if you had a healer, but the shaman thinks he's enhancement even though he's level 19 and that makes no difference but he's unwilling to cast a healing wave so you're stuck looking for a priest which is the only healer your warrior (who is prot BTW) is willing to accept because druid is a meme.
---
A better way to find a group would externally solve this problem, but the fact that it's a problem that can exist makes the game what it is.  It also means that when you have friends that aren't dicks the game gets way better and you want to hold on to them. 
---
Like, the dungeon isn't hard. Having 4 friends who will keep running Maraudon until you get that Thrash blade is something that takes a social investment.  If you had an easy time forming consistent PuGs that would go through Maraudon with you until you got it, it becomes something that's trivial for anyone to get, and it also means you have fewer stories and experiences with friends.
---
likely fake.
---
:o
---
do they also actually role-play!? I might switch if I can be lord paddington bear.
---
The tank shouldn't be out damaging any damage dealers in classic.
---

you definitely don’t need cooking or fishing as a warrior.
---
For G-Sync users: Lock it a few frames lower than your supported G-Sync range.

Just because I think the rules of the game are stupid doesn't mean I'm going to choose to lose the game.

I run a deli department and all my closers have been calling out,  I’m on the clock 48 hours this week, 45 last week,

I’m still level 24 though.
---
It hasn’t been easy so far, I think my poor girlfriend is feeling awfully neglected.
---
I try to play shorter but very efficient sessions, and squeeze them in whenever I can, like a power hour before work every day.
---
And the more casual guilds? The Elemental Earth is going to be valuable, I assure you of that.
---
If you’ll only be in dungeons tailoring/enchanting seems like the only viable options.
---
Well, my computer just turned off completely after i upped the graphics settings. It would not reboot. After putting a different GPU in it booted just fine. I also tested with another 850W PSU that i had, and both of my PSU would begin to start the computer, then click and there would be no power. I think there is a short or something in the GPU.

Thunderclap doesn’t in classic WoW
---
They mostly just shine in endgame, and in group content.  If you want to have an easier/faster time try to group with someone all the time.
---
&gt; you might dodge one hit every 10 fights
---
Huh. Are you expecting to fight one slow attacking mob per fight? Even then it wouldnt be one out of every 10. As a tank you are often taking the hits from 3-4 mobs. In which case all that avoidance stat together will benefit you almost 100% of the fights. Again, this is one pair of boots. You keep comparing this one pair of boots to each fight. Thats now how gearing works. The main goal of every warrior is to cap their avoidance stats.
---
I dont want to go into this anymore but just accept the fact that people have run the numbers on this for the past 15 years and avoidance is way more useful than flat health.
---
Thank you! I've been feelings alot of stress about this for some reason. I get Even more stressed since i dont have as much time to play as my friends at the moment, so when i do play i Find myself staying up way to late geting very little sleep and not stopping to enjoy The game as much as I could have.. Sure We all want to gry to The endgame content. But much of it Will Come in later phases so theres no rush! Spent todays hours on leveling professions and playing The auction house, i also got The corpsemaker in rfk for my shaman so now i feel like a total badass!
---
&gt;Personally I’d rather hit level 40 and buy my mount having close to a hundred gold or more still left over vs being mostly broke after
---
And others would rather reach 40 and get their mounts early, even if that means not having much left over.
---
you dont give a shit about racing like people dont give a shit about you or your job; no one gives a shit about anyone!
---
&gt; no one truly gives a shit that much
---
Then truly, why the fuck did you reply at all? Relax, don't even involve yourself. This reply from you is fucking pointless. Let me enjoy this.
---
Made the grind faster so your income from farming is faster?
---
There is no reason to rush to 60.
---
These poor people, unbeknownst to themselves are still in "retail mode."It's sad. Cause they preach how awesome Classic is, and it's so much better than Retail, and how retail sucks.
---
And there they are, downloading 10+ addons, skipping all quest dialogue, timing their "till next level" progress, and rushing to the end game like they're playing retail.
---
You're forgetting the best in slot weapons and armor you can get from normal quests. that's 1.13. 
---
Headsup  though private servers were also running 1.13.
---
I agree with you too.  I remember how long it took to get gear.  How many times I ran 10 man UBRS.  Like once a night if I could and I still never got everything I wanted because so many people compete for loot.
---
That's not true anymore for 2 reasons:
---
1 - many of us have 10+ years of experience in playing WoW, that makes Classic levelling way more easier than it was for everyone when it first came out. I've seen that since I started playing at launch, not at all difficult as I remember it when I started more then 10 years ago (because of my experience).
---
2 - since when they introduced scaling in retail, doing **current** levelling content is still easy enough but not brain-dead anymore, you have to pay some attention, and since I played BFA up to Classic launch, I can tell you Classic levelling is not as so much harder as you think.
---
The real difference is that Classic is much more *rewarding* than retail, in every aspect, and is also a lot more of an RPG than retail, for various reasons, those have nothing to do with difficulty.
---
You can skip ranks.
---
Reasonably... about a 6 hour drive away from each other.
---
lol I know. I have it set to 142 hz. With my 2080 and ryzen 2700x I never see frame dips either. Buttery smooth. Love it.
---
Agreed.  Unless the tank and healer are too low of level for the instance that should never happen.
---
And in the way they remember why they lost contact...that titanforged socket sword
---
I just dinged 15 this morning I'm hoping to hit 20 by latter in the day tomorrow if I'm lucky
---
Is that hp regent during combat or out of combat?
---
All i see is mount on 40 here.
---
Mages get 6% automatically from their tier 0 talent selection
---
17 - 6 = 11
---
Add 10 hit % and you're capped since that 1% resist/miss is unavoidable no matter what
---
you guys who fucked up and rolled on already high servers are trying to make it my problem on my medium pop server
---
fuck that, it's your problem. you made a dumb decision and you're paying for it
---
that's the vanilla wow way, you fuck up and you eat it.
---
A friend of mine got ban for 2 days for pitchblease.
---
Err... You went through the trouble to repost this?
---
Lmao i love how all your chest thumping about MC being so hard have been proven wrong. Not only cleared in 1 week, but with many people not even lv60 and no wipes on any bosses
---
No, I'm not. I'm the reason why dungeon grinding is extremely efficient. I'm the reason why dungeons take half the time it would normally take.
---
You'll get your chance to tank, at end game. 
---
Cry me a fucking river, pick up a weapon and enjoy DPS'ing for a bit.
---
Wow I didn't even know this item existed. That's pretty weird, considering its a rather low level epic.   
---
I got two hands of edward the odd off two consecutive mobs once. 
---
One of them had to rot on the body though because unique.
---
And I thought I had an addiction.
---
Haha no worries. I did do a lot of dungeon grinding the last 6 levels or so to be fair.
---
the only known image of westfall without 15 people jumping around it
---
It’s useful for getting a wand early and speeding up leveling. You can get a lesser wand by level 6 and a greater wand by 13 with enchanting and tailoring.
---
Why do you allow this to happen? You're a tank, you have all the power. Give 1 warning, and if it happens again you have the person booted or the group can enjoy spending the next 30 minutes spamming lf tank.
---
Best be the horde kinda purple! 🙃
---
Almost all of them? Hard question to answer.
---
Yeah, did that yesterday actually. Tolerated it to LFM for WC and then /left.
---
Ashenvale? Lucky. We have to go to the far corner of Desolace for our cookbook.

Yep quartz great addon, +1 from me
---
Wait!!! Anime tiddies?? 
---
Do you by chance play Xbox and apex legends?
---
You're a good person. Thank you.
---
It is a little sad to sometimes come across a post where a player is asking if they're playing the right way or if they're going the wrong way about it doing this that or the other. These people are putting too much stock on someone else value of play time and can't value their own attitude towards it.
---
And a free bfa xpac (which i wouldn't mind since i dont have it lol)
---
I’m enjoying the journey. 
---
I have a wife, a child, and a full time job.  My schedule in healthcare has me working 1 week straight, and then I get a week off, so in my week off I hit it hard. 
---
I was thankfully off during the release, so hit level 34 in about 5 days before going back to work. 
---
When I work I still try to play a bit in the evening and spend time with my family. To achieve this I remotely log in from work on my phone to hop in the queue, play for an hour or so, then spend time with the fam. 
---
It’s very doable but I also have a chill wife that understands how nostalgic this is for me.
---
You should be able to enchant your weapon as well as use your weapon skill.
---
Rage starvation is already an issue even pre dungeons. I’m trying to practice spamming Sunders as quick as I can but getting the magical 5 before rage dies out is a damn trial.
---
Lmao, so if someone posted LF1M Mage for Armory” it would be fine but it triggers you because the words AoE and Armory were added?
---
Maybe you need to log off and get outside or something.
---
Most what I heard was at lvl 40+
---
But please correct me if I'm wrong.
---
As an old vanilla warlock (classic I'm rolling mage first this time) learning the ropes in 2005, I know this pain all too well.
---
so in 5 years you didn't hit 60? that's called altoholism
---
Every class has that problem in the beginning. Part of survival is only pulling one mob and if you pull two, have an escape plan or die. Except with warrior, you can take a few more hits before dying. Imagine being a mage and accidentally pulling two before you get your sheep spell. You get maybe two seconds before being crushed into a ball of flesh covered in bloody robes.
---
Hell, I doubt I'll even play that much at 60.
---
The thing I enjoyed most about Vanilla (and BC, Wrath, and Cata) was always the journey more so than the destination.
---
I love leveling and exploring the game world, trying different classes and roles, etc.
---
Raiding was never the reason the I played WoW.
---
I just start in 2 or 4 weeks when all the mad people are gone.
---
Makes an ass of you and me
---
a proper lock is going to be drain health or soul siphoning for huge regen anyway.
---
Warrior was my first character back in the day and I enjoyed it even though it was hard af. I didn't tank only did arms and fury but when you hit 60 and start to get gear then you truly fuck people up and the class is a blast to play.
---
I think it is something to do with her brothers. They are into video games and I reckon she picked up the word “Paladin” from them and when I mentioned it she went with it because it sounded familiar :D
---
Yep. I also don’t get why everyone hypes up MC or Onyxia as if it was ever hard.
---
The hard raids are BWL, AQ40 and Naxx. MC is just a chance for some noobs to get a tier set that they likely have no chance of getting in the much harder raids.
---

---
I mained a shaman in vanilla and decided on warrior this time around. I'm not finding it difficult or problematic in the slightest, and I have no idea what people are talking about. Level 30 now, and I still usually kill 4 or 5 mobs in rapid succession without having to eat/bandage. If I pull 2 mobs, it's no problem, maybe I have to pop a health pot. If I pull 3 or 4 and I really don't want to run, I can usually pull it off with retaliation. 
---
Are they the best/fastest class to level? Of course not. Are they really that bad? No.
---
If your going to main tank/off tank in raids, I think level 55 or so is when you to switch your spec to prot. Any lvl b4 that just go full dps leveling build and you ll be able to tank no problem still.
---
Go back to work!
---
The struggle I just levels it at lvl 42 hopefully this supply can make it till ungoro
---
No, his grammar is messed up and he put "with" in the wrong location. He isn't saying he has been with her, he said with her he has been.
---
Oh God why would you do that to yourself? Back in 2005 I took my time too. The adventures I set for myself were waaaaay more fun than actually leveling. Starting as a night elf and trekking across dangerous territory to get to the dwarven/gnome or human starting zones made for some great stories :)
---
Yes. As feral, you can dps or tank dungeons; keep some +int gear in your bank/bags (even if it's cloth) and you can even heal the dungeons.
---
Nice people in WoW? Who knew? Although kinda makes sense, since all the hate, griefing and toxicity found in WoW moved camp and now comfortably resides in Twitter and Facebook.
---
Well, stock up. They're reagents for Priests and Mages, they're materials for some sweet LW items, too.
---
Whats awesome about healing consistent tanks is you build such a rapport that you just get a feel for how much damage is incoming, and the tank trusts their healer. Its great, and it makes pre casting so much easier when youre familiar with each other

It's not that casuals can't play it, but if you don't take it seriously you are just opening yourself up to way more risk than you would otherwise. And yes I'd say the game is populated by at least 30% sociopaths.

Nostalgia my leveling partner was off.

It's not moving the Goalposts. It's Putting them where they belong. 
---
People said Ragnaros would be easy. APES proved how easy it can be if you know what you're doing by killing him with only 24 level 60's.
---
Just because Sodapoppin' couldn't do the same doesn't mean Ragnaros is hard at level 60. 
---
Also note that they actually only pulled him 3 times, and were doing it without modern Addons. Which is something people have been saying from the start, that the sophistication of modern addons is part of why MC will be so fucking easy.
---
Out of curiosity, why do you report names? I'm not surprised or bothered that I get reported for dumb names, but I'm just wondering why people feel the need to do it. Do some names actually upset or offend you?

---
Servers with high pop have no wait time either. Only “full” servers have a wait, and only the most grossly overpopulated of them have a long wait. Eg Blaumeux has been High or Full every time I log on for the last several days, and the longest queue I’ve been in was 15 minutes.

gotcha, thanks for the advice!

Best path is 2 handed fury until 40.  Then switch to 2 handed arms until 60.  Arms without mortal strike is slow going.
---
If it isn't automatically showing what you want it to do, you can force it to show a specific spell, e.g `#showtooltip Frostbolt` or `#showtooltip Frostbolt(Rank 1)` (the former defaults to the highest level version).

Best of luck! Make sure to be mega patient with her!
---
At even levels, sure. But the mage was -3/-4 levels against the mobs there, the warrior was within 2. The warrior was hitting a lot more, the mage was getting a ton of resists.  Given the player and npc levels, I'm not surprised the tank did more dps.
---
Back in the day it wasnt about getting to the end as fast as you can...for most of us. It was about having fun. The game later changed to rushing through as fast as you can. It became about the endgame. many things made that easier and that why you see in retail people race thru dungeons as fast as they can. 
---
Classic is fun. You dont have the heirlooms and have to care about those nice pieces of gear.  generally its a slower pace. like he says enjoy the ride.

I'm sorry, but what?  I have no idea what you're trying to say with this one.  Are you trying to be insulting?  Agreeing with me?  Commenting on the downvotes?
---
In summery; huh?  Ya lost me.

My cousin and I rolled rogues named identically (other than an accent) just to be as annoying as possible.

Lava runs work, had some guildies doing them yesterday. They said that “lava runs are harder in Classic” is a meme and is still extremely easy.
---
Okay so basically I'm just not going to use it ever if I'm playing correctly?

It's garbage, but it's convenient garbage

OP you gotta explain how you did this.

Haven't been on classic forums in a while. what are they being grumpy about?
---
I'm a total noob but I don't usually start healing the tank until he has like 70% health or so.  I'm just throwing SW:P around and wanding.  Obvi depends on the size of the pull though.  My thinking is that there is a not a ton of value in keep a tank (or any player) at full health when you can preserve mana by healing less often.

Tab 1, so I can click other abilities as needed. I know it's not the most optimum route, but I didn't have time to check recommendations on layouts because I was trying really hard to win the race.

I had a tauren druid named oprawindfury

As dps, not pulling aggro is part of our job. Do your job.
---
There was a guild on the server I'm on called 'Sapped girls can't say no'. My hubby told me and I said I'd report it if I saw it but I haven't,  I hope it got banned.
---
MC and Ony were starter raids. Even during Vanilla (and I raided until BC launch) they were never hard. Punishing if you didn't have the DPS or the heals needed but that was it. BWL began introducing more complex mechanics and coordination needed. AQ40 and Naxx pushed it as far (at that time) as they could. 
---
It is no wonder MC and Ony are already done. A vast majority of Vanilla raiders cleared that content back then anyways. Hopefully in Classic we will see more people get through BWL, AQ40, and Naxx this time around.
---
From my understanding the main issue is that they have now survival cooldowns.
---
A buddy of mine used his real name to play, and got a forced name change when somebody got offended.

Same here haha, every time I look at his screen he is dead. It has become a running joke.

“What? You died *again*?”

keep thinking that.

Campfire is really a solid name for a guild imo.

If it makes you feel better, there hasn't been one time I've gone to my demon trainer and I somehow, SOMEHOW, miss the glaringly obvious red "ALREADY KNOWN" and bought my pet skills they already know. My demon trainer is a wealthy wealthy man because of my dumbass.

Lvl 15 warrior lvl 20 pally lvl 9 warrior lvl 8 priest. Playing all 4 separately at different times. With different people. Taking it nice and slow. Also didn't play for the first like 3 or 4 days because que times suck lol
---
There are other guilds struggling to clear MC at 60. Dont underestimate the skill of APES.
---
you can tank everything up to raids just fine as non prot spec. i'm leveling fury and have done so with all my vanilla warriors. never had problems tanking in fury or arms in 5 mans. prot really shines for tanking untauntable bosses that are in raids and for the added damage mitigation on the heavy hitters.

I’ve never reached max level and I’ve played WoW on and off for like 10 years now. The highest level I ever got to was 50. Seriously, am I missing something or am I just shit at this game? In modern WoW I would usually do quests until I reached level 20-ish, and then I would just do dungeons. How do people get to the max level, and how do they do it without getting bored?
---
As a minor note: there are no (or very few) bots out for resources....
---
I am leveling as a Warrior Herb/Alc and I am regularly tripping over herbs which keeps me in troll blood and heal pots during my leveling...
---
If I was a caster, Mana pots would be easy enough.... also your friends will love you for a spare Swiftness pot....
---
Every time I see a random herb on my travels I always expect to see a farmer bot swoop on to it before I can reach it.... lol
---
Just don't expect to make any major money on it for a while since the huge money sinks of riding at 40 and expert riding at 60 will drain the market of any spare cash for the forseeable future...
---

Checking him out now! Thanks!

Another reason Shaman is the superior tank!
---
Pay really close attention to grey items, their value to the vendor, and how easily they drop.
---
There are lots of high-value trash like furs that sell for 6s a pop and drop almost 50% of the time or more. An hour farming trash can easily turn into a small sum of gold, and that stuff adds up quick
---
No changes

Lucky you, apparently Kirtonos Horde is full of toxic players, I've been told "kys" and "fuck you" on multiple occasions now, and kicked from dungeon parties for no reason. It's been quite a time. But the majority has been positive interactions for sure.
---
Works fine for me without doing anything special.  Just installed classic in the same bnet launcher I used for BFA under linux.  Would help if you post console output - that usually will let you know about what error is happening.  If I had to guess you might just be missing a dependency for wow.  If using a tool like dxvk make sure vulkan is installed/setup.
---
Some people love healing, some people hate healing. People tend to dislike paladin healing because it's kind of boring, just two buttons, and a lot of hate comes from the "class fantasy" not being fulfilled. Character creation says paladins are tanks, heals, and dps; monster holy avengers in full plate. The raiding reality is that they're pretty much only healers, and they're going to be wearing cloth. The end result is a lot of people bitter that they were forced into spamming heals and wearing dresses when what they wanted to do was wear plate and slap things with hammers.
---
Paladins only have single target heals, so they will be healing tanks and only tanks. That makes it a bit more monotonous: two buttons, one target, don't stand in fire.

Hmmmmmmm maybe just MAYBE consider playing on a server that is not completely full?
---
You go as arms, you don't skill deep wounds since % dmg talents suck at low level. Sweeping strikes is an amazing talent for tanking and soloing more than 1 enemy, specially later with mortal strike. After MS I'd take the 5% crit in the fury tree and rest in prot.
---
Whoa, I have seen Rule 34 on that shit. Man I need to moderate my internet intake better.
---
since when would "animetiddies" be edgy..it's just a stupid joke name a 12 year old name. Mine is equally as dumb.
---
Why would on-level Horde be in Redridge?  Just looking for a fight I guess :)
---
I would be okay with dual spec, but still paying the full fee to respec each tree. I'd also be okay with a more modern AH, but other than that - I'm good.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames does literally everything you asked for and more! It also has a threat meter and better name plates additions and supports the addon Real Mob Health so you can see how much health enemy mobs (not players) have exactly!
---
Because they were hard back in the day. Pretty sure we are using a patch that nerfed MC, not to mention what APES did doesn’t represent the difficulty level at all.

I'm just screwing around and having fun. I'm in no rush

I implore you not to get involved, I'm just finishing up some smack with all the retards that suddenly spawned.
---
I was bouncing back and forth between Mulgore and Durotar until I hit 14. Then went and bounced an alt from Teldrassil and Elwynn until 14.  No rush club
---
I’m warrior tanking right now and I don’t really care if someone pulls threat off of me, so long as they don’t complain about it. If you want to burst things down fast and you get threat off that, I will do my best to tank it off you but I don’t want to hear anything about holding threat. Like you said these low level dungeons, threat doesn’t matter too much and most heals can handle it. 
---
I think that’s a fair trade.
---
I haven’t seen the other threads you mentioned but I can imagine some tanks getting butt hurt over it, I just don’t want DPS complaining at the same time.
---
Yikes
---
Imagine not bringing at least 1-3 mages to a dungeon X_X
---
RIP phone users
---
are you on a low pop server? I'm playing on a full one and literally any time I'm in a city there is at least 3 people in trade spamming that they will make bags free with mats lol its actually kinda obnoxious.
---
In low level dungeons, where clothies can easily tank 10+ hits from the elites, it really doesn't matter at all.
---
I think it's mostly this
---
None, I find exploring and determing my own journey to be an essential exhilarating experience personally.  It isn't just about hitting 60 but the journey to it as well.
---
Druid doesn't need anything from leather working that can't be bought from the auction house.
---
Very end game, herbalism and alchemy are constant money makers,
---
Leather working gets less and less work, only when alts need something.
---
There are some afk money making guides that focus on leatherworking, e.g. Fill backpacks with leather, craft for hours, sell to vendor.

If you get more fps than your G-Sync supports then G-Sync is completely off.

---
Yeah, sounds like you may have missed the setting I'm talking about. Incoming heals/damage appear on both my portrait and near my actual character as they float upwards and away.
---
Imo don’t worry too much about the rogues. We have tons of tools to deal with aggro. Plus, our dmg is very front end heavy. I expect to pull aggro on the first kill target on every pull, but that mob is usually dead so quick it doesn’t matter. The only time I intentionally pull aggro is peeling, slowing, stunning mobs from the healer. Also, we’re used to getting ahead of the group, we have positional requirements for our hardest hitting abilities. Again don’t worry about us too much, we have vanish and sprint to get out of oh shit situations.

Nearly everyone that got the top rank had to have 2 people playing the account.  Or be unemployed.  All it took was being in BGs 24/7.  Playing well didn't really matter.

I have a Mage on Alliance side... I'm convinced that Fire Blast is the most useless Mage spell.
---
I have only had it succeed like 5 times TOTAL. Every other time I try to use it, it gets resisted.
---
That's not at all true at low levels.  You don't seem to know what you are talking about.
---
It's ok man, just tough it out to 18, group with other people, do whatever it takes to get there. At 18, put on a shield and tank. Dungeon gear will make a world of difference.
---
Also, don't sleep on Staves, Staff of Westfall or the staff you get from the WC quest chain as horde are really great.

Took a few days off lol

You know what you can do? You can literally just not look at it. It's seriously as simple as that dude.

Alright, a small mistake on my part. I should've said ONE OF our most effective heals. 
---
But that doesn't make it less awesome.
---
Well to be thorough, despite what it may looked like I really don't like the currencie/gold exchange, whether it is legal via a token, or illegal via a third party site. I should mention that English is not my primary language, I'm French so what I write might not always mean what I intended. 
---
When I bought gold, it was on vanilla, I was in a top guild at that time (top 10eu iirc) so I needed lots of plants, stuff to farm and all that. Like a lot. And in the end of classic, during naxx, I got my life kind of back on track (I was a real nolife at that point) got a job and such. I tried to compete ig for a time, and it was at that moment I bought gold, 'cause I couldn't keep up with the farm, and I had to buy a lot of stuff. Eventually it didn't work out, and I stopped playing completely until wotlk in a casual mode.
---
But to get back to the discussion, I'm back on classic, having stopped playing retail a few months ago, because I like to earn my stuffs.
---
But I understand that spamming is annoying. I'm on a French server so it may not be as bad as on EN servers, and I really don't see them that much. 
---
 But to be clear, I don't like gold selling. By blizzard or another one. I just think that the system of tokens (which I don't like, right? ^^) is exactly the same as the one with sites selling gold.
---
If you work with stats in real life than this even more embarrassing. You linked a page for the top Rag parses and it has 39 players on it, that is the kind of data you are comfortable saying "there is a skill gap" in players for vanilla raids off of. I'm sorry that somehow the retail rotations are too difficult for you to handle, but you are obviously delusional if you think these stats mean anything towards your point of classic not being completely mindless when it comes to raiding. 
---
You will never judge a skill gap off of 39 players or 1700 parses, no one even knows the website you linked exists. You're too busy thinking of "insults" to throw around to use your head and even attempt to open your mind to the possibility that you are wrong.
---
This is what I was trying to say. Thank you :)

I love seeing this brown bread response lol. I'm sorry if people going out to work and school use remote software to join queues early to get any chance of entering the game at a reasonable hour offends you.

Hell I get triggered when I get a heal out of combat
---
It's like, hello! I have infinity stacks of top tier food and no HP! Don't bother healing me. Save your Mana and let me Regen to full in like 8 seconds of eating
---
My first character in vanilla was a warrior because I assumed it would be the easiest class to familiarize myself with the game. It was brutal. I died all the time. I learned that I would never do that again. I applaud you brave soldier.
---
Have you heard the word of our lord and savior frost mage?

yeah but my gsync supports 144 so...

Why the hell would you do them 2-5 times you're not making any sense.

Why be salty? Silly. Be happy friend.

If you get a swing timer addon, you can time slam to land during your auto-attack. This will effectively double the attack speed for your 2hander.
---
Yep, its Expert Fishing - The Bass and You. Requires Level 20, Requires Fishing (125). Cost 1g and bought from Old Man Heming in STV.
---
guess what its so fucking unfriendly that im breaking up
---
bad advice, prot makes you take MORE damage not less, you significantly decrease damage vs mobs which means incoming damage for much longer, the talents are for optimizing an endgame tank, they aren't reducing damage you take by 50% but it will take 50-100% longer to kill a mob.
---
Wow this is helpful actually thank you! I’ve been giving shield to tank the entire time 😭😂

After 40 yes. Try to have gear ready for it. Pick quest rewards to transition easier.

"played wow all weekend and loved it"
---
Does warrior become harder as you level up? I'm level 29 and not really having a super hard time yet. Just be sure to only pull 1 mob at a time and try not to fight anything 2 levels higher. Also make sure to upgrade your weapon every couple of levels. If you get in trouble hamstring and run. It's definitely not easy but I think people exaggerate. Maybe I will eat my words in a few levels.
---
Alcoholism is like the only addiction where people think you're weird if you don't partake.  So messed up
---
I saw a General Chat troll getting his ass handed to him by about four mobs.  Normally, I would lend a hand but I recognized the name and was like, "Nah." Then watched him die from a distance with no small amount of personal satisfaction.
---
i really hope you find peace with yourself. you might tho k you have it but you do not.
---
Don’t play based on what others expect. Play how *YOU* want. I just hit 20 on my warrior and rolled a shaman this morning who I got to 5. Meanwhile my friend is going on 36 last I knew. Stop caring what others think and focus on what you want to do.
---
i actually do control words because i invented the language
---
I will not be the first 60 in my guild.  Might be the first to have 2.
---
Well you'll need 80g by level 40 right? That's an average of 2g per level. 
---
Obviously we aren't making 2g per low level, but by that average you can at least say "hey I'm 24, and I have more or less 48g, cool I'm on track!" 
---
You'll be playing catch up at first, but if you can eventually tuck away twice as much gold as the level you are, you'll reach your goal.
---
That's odd. It rained for hours in elwynn forest during my teen levels. People started to complain because it just didn't stop
---
Thank you sir
---
Nah, and since I make the groups, if you disagree feel free to leave, theres 100 DPS behind you who can take your spot. I'm here to have fun as well, and letting some Mage flex his e-peen via spamming AoE's isn't my idea of fun.
---
Blizzard mentioned they might allow free migrations at some point, since they want to remove layers before phase 2, and they can't do that if the queues are still huge. But I don't think now is the time for that. You had 1 week to move to another server before having 2+ days /played, and I don't see how a free server change will help with the general inertia of people who really really really want to play on the biggest servers.
---
So Blizzard creating classic wow killed your gaming addiction?
---
Yup, exactly.
---
I've no doubt that others may know of more complex, and perhaps more efficient ways to do it, but for me I have many macros set for simplifying the 'stance dance'.
---
For my Shield Bash, I believe I have it set: (each on a separate line, but Reddit won't let me do that, so I'll indicate with commas) #showtooltip Shield Bash, /cast Defensive Stance, /equip (1h weapon name), /equip (shield name), /cast Shield Bash

Yep same thing happens to me. I wasn’t sure if this was a full in feature but everytime I’m clawing an enemy on my car Druid, and simply click on another target without attacking, then switch back, my combo points are gone
---
The rush was to get that first week rag. 
---
The first week is gone. I reckon queues will still be there, but reduced this week as the neckbeards go back to other stuff besides only wow.
---
Yeah I nearly solo'd an elite as a Rogue but died on the last hit cause I forgot to make Tea lol
---
Someone was very, very left out.
---
Even if this was a genuine post... your analysis is pretty terrible. Is it the same time of day, have you considered the increase in server cap, your data set is very small, etc, etc. Honestly many of us on Full servers do not mind a significant amount of people quitting the game. (I know Skeram can afford to lose at least 5k players, and for personal reasons - see queue times- I hope it does).

A publishing deal doesn't give rights to anything, it's basically just a contract where the publisher provides a service in exchange for a cut of the money.

They had a publishing deal but that didn't give Activision rights to anything. In fact, their deal specified that any new IP from Bungie developed during that time would be solely owned by Bungie, and that included Destiny 4 years after they made the deal.

And it looks the same on the other side.

Glad to see there’s others taking their time to enjoy the game, I’m sitting at 24 right now and my biggest worry is will there be other people my level to help me on quests lol
---
I leveled tailoring and skinning and at level 34 am near the mount cost. 
---
Selling bags has made me a small fortune during the level rush and selling skinning mats likewise has taken good care of me.  
---
Other advise I would give is to pick weapons as quest rewards even if you can’t use them unless another option would be a significant upgrade.  Around level 30 most weapons from quests sell for 50+ silver and since you can’t put them on the auction house they make good vendor income.

So tired of that argument already. Good luck in DM!

Your server will likely fill up with or without transfers. Most of them have and then you'll be back where you started.

Blood Elves for Horde
---
why the fuck would you save an item for a year to make 8 gold.
---
If you play mage priest you can easily provide her with water to refill her mana so its a good combo but i would worry more about playing what you enjoy and not any sort of synergy. If you plan to be maxed in a few weeks on your first playthrough with 5hours a day you will be dissapointed. It might take 3 months depending on how you play the game. You should enjoy it. There is no rush to get to 60. Learn some lore. Enjoy the world. Get in a guild. Talk with people they will help you. None of us followed details guides when we started playing. We just made a character and learned as we went. This is less about grinding and "striving" for something and more about getting immersed in the WORLD of warcraft. Make friends. Do what is fun. Get excited about your loot. Craft armor for your girlfriend. Have fun. Font try to minmax you will just get bored. I recommend you play on a pvp realm. Its way more fun
---
I also take is slow and enjoy. 39 atm and carrying my proffession with me

This is the exact reason I am leaving Kirtonis (horde). Based on what I hear from the Kirtonis discord, the alliance side is just as bad.

They're a right to vote?
---
Are you sure? I recently tried feeding my pet owl raw meat and their happiness was going up by the same, max amount.

Who?
---
most the exp comes from grinding, if you only focus on turning in quests you will run out of quests way before 60

I name my death knights after various cancers.  Most people don't even notice but one got mad about melanoma.

omg who the hell cares

I mean you could DM me and if it ever leaks you know it was me :P
---
Something must be wrong because I have done these steps and came up with different results.
---
The Wetlands vendor is a goblin, so Horde can buy there. There's also a vendor at Freewind Post in Thousand Needles and Sun Rock Retreat in Stonetalon Mountains that should sell liferoot.
---
It's not cheap, but it's way better than AH prices.
---
I hadn't played in years (since right after Cata, I think?) and I didn't expect to want to ever play again. But here I am, having played for almost the entire long weekend. And can't wait to go home and play tonight. Nostalgia is powerful, obviously, but it's just a fun game when you get right down to it. And the community is incredible.
---
Healers can drink during the beginning of a pull, while locks should be dotting. Then locks tap into wand and start regen. Heals on tank, then HoT lock, finish pull and start drinking while the next pull begins.
---
Or just get a good bear tank who HoTs himself and the lock to get healing aggro before each pull.
---
Use atlas loot addon to find dungeon loot you might want.
---
Use Seal of Wisdom if you are healing and running out of mana.
---
I was investigating getting new case fans until I saw this post. I’ll try limiting FPS but if that doesn’t work your solutions will be next. Thank you.
---
What addon is that bar across the top?
---
I tried the AH game and would say: not worth the effort right now.
---
The people are just killing and killing and killing. Most of the items a more then one time in the auction house. There might be some niche items that work or require a deeper understanding of wow mechanics.
---
A basic rule for the items:
---
* Cloth Int/Spirit/Stamina = Warlock, Mage, Priest (
---
* Leather Agi/Strength/Stamina "Spirit" = Shaman, Rogue, Hunter, Druid(Feral)
---
* Mail (till 40) = Strength/Agi/Stamina or "Spirit" = Warrior, Paladin
---
* Mail (after 40) = Agi/Strength/Stamina or "Spirit" = Hunter, Shaman
---
* Plate Strength/Agi/Stamina or "Spirit" = Warrior, Paladin
---
Weapons might have higher demand.
---
* The caster prefer Intellect Staffs + High DPS Wands
---
* Melees prefer High DPS with Str/Agi/Stamina
---
* Hunters prefer High Ranged DPS + Melee Weapons for Stats (normaly a hunter doesnt need to use those melee weapons and use it only for "stats"
---
As a general rule was: grey = vendor trash, white = might be useful (check wowhead if the item is a ingredient of a reciepe or something) and green = disenchant, try to sell or vendor for fast cash
---
Thanks for the tips guys i got it in 30 minutes and i saw 5 on the AH for 20 gold. So i put it up there for 19gold idc that much tbh i just want the gold for my mount. Thanks annyway!
---
Could anyone translate?
---
Booooo
---
Slow down, kiddo.
---
Is it really worth speccing aoegrind then? You lose out on so much single target potential due to skipping frostbite.
---
I don't even go into dungeons with 5. We just get 3 DPS and a healer, and we're set on a tank. Sometimes not even a healer because I just use a healthstone.
---
But all the hunters that see me so far respect the doggo running up and licking their pet. 
---
The druids so far dont all get that as long as we stay animal forms its friendly dance time.
---
Wouldn't that also restrict diversification of gear to more people? At some point limiting the amount of people will lead to wasted gear?
---
It's Battle &amp; Defensive Stance. Pummel is berserker stance.
---
Yeah I saved a 20 mage last night from certain death in the Barrens.  
---
As I get destroyed by just a few of the same mobs that ganged up on him earlier, I see him walk up, assess, and leave.  I survived.
---
His dumbass does the same thing and overpulls, and that's when I let him die.  Don't help me after I save you?  GTFO
---
I was running a dungeon with a group and won the roll. They then said "lowest wins" as I'm opening it and demanded I stop opening it.
---
Left that group so fast.
---
I didnt make any suggestion about punishment. I simply said it is probably against ToS. Unfair advantage is a bit grey. I will leave you guys to decide for yourself whether people having money to pay for extra account vs those that dont is an unfair advantage. It seems very pay 2 win to me though.
---
Eh I wouldn't say more power to anyone who spends every evening drinking. On occasion yeah but I've known a lot of people over my years of MMO playing that spent every session drinking
---
I think I lost some IQ reading this autistic shit
---
Thats called a ninja looter my guy.
---
Ubuntu 18.04
---
I have only wine and I'm already using it for other apps so I would avoid messing with it.
---
Is Lutris based on wine?
---
Android tablet + bluetooth keyboard + mouse + moonlight, steamlink, or parsec. Seems to be the best experience for remote play imo.
---
&gt; Did you even read the original parent comment?
---
Yeah, "About 2 days later this same person runs up to me in the Barrens" would include crossroads or possibly all sorts of popular spots like the oases, camp taurajo, or the spots where people were camping for 20-30 minutes in the same spot for named spawns for quests. 
---
You have a malfunction because you're literally MAKING UP THINGS about this guy's story to make it fit your weird narrative that your broken brain has created, and are turbonerd copy/pasting dictionary definitions like someone who doesn't understand how words work. 
---
You also have a major malfunction because my first post was a JOKE and you got super butthurt and started responding to it. It was said in sarcastic jest and you got offended and tried to 'defend' yourself with dictionary definitions and facts about how long you've played online games. You should probably go outside or see a psychologist to find out where you land.
---
What is that device?
---
I've been trying to play like this, but in the mid 20s its been:
---
Start a quest or story, do the one quest because all of the others are orange despite this zone being your level, maybe get another? No? Ok back to another zone to complete their 1 yellow quest that doesn't have me kill orange level mobs. 
---
I bounced zones probably once an hour for all of the 20s, and the 30s aren't looking much better. I don't mind it being slow, but quests already feel so thin and I don't remember it being this bad on alliance side when I played that in vanilla.
---
Honestly good nsfw, this is hard to see
---
I've been playing Shaman Tank (mostly lower level dungeons so far) and ShamTank threat generation comes from Earth Shock and Rockibiter mostly so shield me as much as you want!
---
Yeah, this is an outstanding issue imho - simply tabbing from target to target should not wipe combo, using an ability on another target should.
---
Only on the alliance lol, RP to max
---
First time WoWer here.  Playing on Kromcrush (Horde).  Looking for leveling buddies or a group.
---
dae fornite bad
---
&gt;People have always claimed that vanilla was hard for the time
---
Who claims this?  Compared to what?  WoW was derided as an MMO with training wheels on release by a good amount of MMO players at the time.
---
Too bad warriors gain rage when they are hit :/
---
&gt; The world is smaller
---
And yet because there's no flying, no flightpaths every 20 steps, and even no mounts at all until you're level 40 the world *feels* bigger.
---
Just cause you think DM was deadmines doesn’t make it true. As VC was the known across majority of the servers for Deadmines
---
I've heard it referred to the volcano system as well, but it's also semi subjective. During the honorbuddy ban wave(s) in WoD several guildies received 1 year bans for it (which is not on the volcano chart).
---
I was put off the first time by this. Many were or they wouldn’t need directions to find it on the launcher.
---
Omar!!! Give Tab !!!
---
Yup. get yourself a bow or a gun and just pull slowly.
---
I'm enjoying it more than I thought I would.
---
You can; I recommend it even. Note however that weapon switching will give you a GCD so there’s no way to react to a 1.5s cast. Very annoying if you’re leveling, since you want to use a 2h weapon even when tanking. Pummel doesn’t come till level 40ish, so you’re kind of stuck.
---
It’s best to just LOS the casts if you can; healers should do the same. (Or rank1 earth shock etc.) Rogues have a lower GCD so they can kick the casts more reliably. Healers can often dispel the sleeps/roots which do go off; I think their dispels come around level 25ish. But the early dungeons are easy enough that most casts you can simply allow.
---
but that seal of the martyr\\blood was actually just ridiculous
---
The real galaxy brain play
---
But won't that set you back like 2 levels before you could start AOE farming? Questing feels tiring at times so you just want to jump to AOE farming as fast as possible as a mage. You could probably start at 21/22 if you focused everything to Frost.
---
Well guess what, the earth is flat because I am saying it is.
---
Classic hunter mentality thinking agi is bad for warrs
---
Yup i'm also on verizon fios gigabit, NA EAST, same issue
---
I had an interesting experience like this as well, but across factions. For context I'm a gnome mage. I was questing in Desolace and I saw this undead mage overpull some infernals and succubi in the southern area. I helped her finish them off and we sat and drank in a mutual ceasefire for a few minutes then went our own way. Hours later, I was questing in Stranglethorn Vale and overpulled some trolls. I'm down to like 10%-20% hp and low mana and suddenly an undead mage took aggro on a couple of them and we finished them off, again drinking in peace before going our separate ways. It was incredible, hours apart myself and someone in the OTHER FACTION managed to save each other.
---
I came here from /all, not a WOW player really but I did find this funny. About 15 years ago I dated a guy who was majorly into WOW. I thought it looked cool so I asked if he could set up an account for me so that I could play. I played for a bit that day and got to level 3. The next week when I visited him I turn on the game to continue playing and to my surprise I’m at level 25. I asked him how that was possible and he said “Oh yeah I leveled you up”. I was like why?? He said “So that you can play the higher levels” and it was just the weirdest thing to me. He thought he did me a favor but all I wanted was to take my time and enjoy the beauty of the game! Plus since I didn’t actually play those levels my skills were not on par with the level and I lost interest. Still funny that to him the main goal was to just get to the highest level as quickly as possible when I wanted to take my sweet time!
---
Gives me the idea to make a “dad’s only” guild on an RP server where we all pat each other on the back for playing 15 minutes a month and level solely on plainstriders until level 20 cause damnit, that’s the true spirit of classic right there I tell ya hwhat.  Reach 30 before BC?  Bye, don’t need those kind of toxic aoe farming tryhards.
---
Because some players enjoy the 'world' part of WoW, and the stories from 1-60, rather than just seeing leveling as a chore before 'the real game starts' at max level. It's not about needing validation, its about letting people that haven't experienced wow back in this state that that depth/breadth is there, and not write off the 1-60 experience.
---
It's not about the speed you level, its about enjoying the flavour of the world. I like taking my time again with these quests that I did 10 years ago, and enjoying them again, rather than just ignoring them, and then sitting around doing nothing for the limited amount of content at 60.

From my past experience Purple Diamond was always Sap

Yep, same here.  NA East, Verizon, Deviate Delight server.  I was healing an instance, too.  :(
---
Classic wow requires a subscription, there is no trial to 20 for classic.
---
I hear you, but its hard.  On my server its superbad to the point the lfgs and gametalk is drowning in a sea of trump chat.  You cant look away from it because you use it to talk about the game with other players
---

Play on a server with no queue?

Benediction?

The sword of 1000 truths is the only way to stop me
---
Does your motherboard have onboard graphics? If so, try that to see if it works for you. If there is still no output, it definitely is the motherboard or monitor.  
---
There are a lot of things you can do to troubleshoot this. Do you have another monitor laying around to test with? Additional cables?
---
Was that on westfall server? I think I've seen someone with that name therr
---
ditto mid-Atlantic
---
It’s probably a factor. I could never be tempted back to retail but I’d pre-order a WoW2 right now. Take from that what you will.
---
It's clearly an exploit.  It's just messed up that some people can get away with it very publicly.
---
Why Ask Reddit .
---
Blizzard gotpeople being payed for that and help
---
I believe each server is separated into layers that holds the true max player cap (Since you'll only ever be on 1 layer at a time) so smaller servers won't necessarily be less busy
---
But I would shoot for medium/highish just for the inevitable fallout in a month.
---
If alliance knows what's good for them they will lay down their weapons! FOR THE HORDE!!
---
It almost sounds like you may  have turned off your PC while it was updating windows before it logged in?  I've had some complete garbage computers need to wait overnight to login to windows after an update.  Like it would take hours, but it eventually worked and the problem went away.
---
If you boot it up does anything show up before windows loads?  Can you verify that the monitor at least works?
---
* Assholes are normal on the internet. That said, the beauty with Classic WoW is that everyone plays on the same server (no cross-server BS like in retail), so assholes end up having no one to play with when their reputation gets *that* bad.
---
* Hunters are a special breed. Their melee weapons barely see any use, but they still "need" the stats they provide, so it's somewhat fair game for them to roll need on upgrades, just like it's normal for Paladin/Shaman/Druid healers to roll on cloth that would otherwise benefit a Mage/Warlock/Priest better.
---
* Don't bring something up after the fact. It's just not worth it, since you can't trade BoP items after the roll. Calling someone out might make them look bad if you're correct, just like it might make you look bad if you're wrong, but in the end, it won't change anything, but it will cause drama. Further, if you're invited in a group, you never know who's friends with who, so if the tank/healer is friends with the hunter (in this specific case), there's no way you're winning the argument, even if you're right.
---
Bottom line is you could've avoided the situation altogether by keeping silent (despite how frustrating it is when Huntards roll on your stuff). Just run the instance again if you're after a piece in particular. In the end, you're apparently more upset about the drama than the blue 2H Axe, so just don't bother policing rolls in PuGs, especially if you're the lowest level member in the group. It's unfair, it's frustrating, but so is life and no one like a whiner, even when they're right.
---
Good luck with that later on. I'd suggest not getting into any bad habits because you will be in for quite the wake up call.
---
I feel like this is rarer than the lottery
---
Is classic gonna have realm transfers?
---
Just wait until BWL, AQ40 and Naxx then you will hear people talking about how hard it is.
---
Mc and ony is like raider training school.
---
WoW Classic is my filler game. At this point the $15/month sub seems excessive
---
My friend and I have fios in the northeast. DC'ed 10 mins ago, cant connect to Bnet or login
---
Same.  Verizon got kicked.. net neutrality!!!!! Jk lmao
---
Yeah. I'm \~32 and I figured it would "go away" once I got past The Barrens/Hillsbrad but unfortunately it did not.
---
&gt; Druids can tank or heal end game. Their damage isn't great either.
---
wym, feral druid is on par with fury warrior and rogue in raids
---
lol damn that blows me away that MC is cleared already.
---
What he said.
---
Lol at you if you believe that. You are delusional.
---
Enchanting is a black pit that sucks in money. Hold off on leveling it till you have your mount, instead sell the greens.
---
this actually made me laugh out loud
---
Getting this too
---
Or just tank with a 2H, tbh, except for bosses.
---
Fellow lvl 18 druid here. Hang in there brother. Elune be with you!
---
I will have to say though if you exclusively like to play on PVP servers that might not be possible. 
---
You /may/ need to settle for making alts on a non pvp server to "enjoy that slow experience" with how many people are on these servers. When phase two comes around the gank fests will begin for those honor points. 
---
I definitely am not racing to the end myself though. Only hit level 29 today.
---
Still 15, one thing I noticed from classic is that noone will help you fight mobs they just look at you getting murder by them then they take the kill. Shit attitude but oh well. I remember classic being full of awesome sauce.
---
That's nice.
---
Lol appreciated but it's just meaningless karma. I guess the RP patrol is out in full force, where fun in video games isn't allowed.
---
You get it by 21 :D
---
Imagine waiting for a tank to build agro in wc and thinking that's normal and optimal and using it as an argument for why tanks should do more damage LOL.  You're not good at this game stop talking like you are.
---
Not a bad idea
---
Is your friend’s pic a steak?
---
Obviously I'm aware that I can re-roll on another server, and this comment is unrelated to my question.
---
I'm not complaining. I'm not insisting Blizzard do anything. I'm not asking if anyone has a solution. All I did was ask if there is any news I've missed out on regarding paid transfers.
---
Channeled spells and DoTs can't crit. They didn't add that til maybe Cataclysm?
---
Many do it so they can turn around and gank lowbies. If wager this is a majority of them if pvp server. These types are shitty players.
---
Typing the full name of the instance is more efficient than endlessly debating the short hand
---
Still up for debate internally. Free transfers are more likely, to balance population. Paid transfers under discussion.
---
Mankrik wife where?
---
At 21 you’ll go super fast. At least if you put all talents in feral at that point and get the 30% ms. Either way when you get catform you can kill things pretty fast.
---
Yeah, I never cared enough to learn more about it, but time and again there appeared to be drama that materialized between players and those running those projects.
---

RIP. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I used to laugh at the man with no life then I became him.
---
Yeah, I’ve never had a name reported. 
---
I was just more curious if there were hard/fast rules, which apparently there are not. 
---
So, to your point, a gnome warrior named Buttnugget could play for years if he never runs into a player that finds the name offensive and reports them.
---
You had people who had no idea how to install add ons and people still playing on dial up at the time as well.
---
They're just dicks.  If you're in the run and WILL use said item, you're just as entitled to it as anyone else.
---
Have you tried a /reload after making the change? Have you tried recreating the macro?
---
Cope harder buddy
---
*rich mon.  Kek
---
east coast US on fios reporting broken too
---
Yes, still spec feral for healing
---
Druids don't need resto talents to heal effectively in dungeons or lvling quests
---
Yep. Was fishing and got booted. Offline on b.net now :(
---
1) You're spending too much time leveling profs, I mostly ignored mine until after I got mount. Enchanting especially is a costly investment.
---
2) You probably bought too many skills you don't actually use, stop buying skills if they aren't core upgrades for your rotation
---
3) Go AoE grind, you are a mage and that makes a lot of g/hr. You should have been doing that from 21+ ideally
---
Well I’m not alone...also east coast FiOS
---
that looks like 5 people but a spot for a 6th. so the 6th just kinda never got to party with the others? ouch. dont like those numbers one bit! downvote this social exclusion bully post!!!
---
He had the same skin as the raiders there too or close enough. It's dark.
---
verizon has a pretty poor track record with leaking and/or otherwise fucking up BGP routes, wouldn't be surprised if it was that or some kind of peering issue between verizon's network and bnet
---
Use ElvUI
---
Oh I just realized, it's because I have nameplates. I can see guild names when they're in the distance (too small to read though) but once they get closer I get nameplates instead. And tooltips don't show guild tags.
---
if you die 6 times while doing rfc youre just a shit warrior
---
thanks for the reply ill try that out. i was having similar trouble with macroing auto shoot turning itself off.
---
i used to be like you and argue all the time. just stop. it’s really not worth it and much easier to just not care about things of this size. it shows you have issues, which i did. get past them and you won’t feel like you have to be negative and ‘right’ all the time.
---
They need to be addressed and removed. It's worse than low effort memes.
---
It's like when you are texting someone still with nothing to say. Useless conversation.
---
dude, not even going to bother reading. This is a very clear as day situation. You misread it. That's fine. Just own it. Cheers
---
I leveled a warrior in vanilla.  I picked hunter this time based on leveling speed and ease.
---
is it bound to a character or account? i could always make my own twink right
---
My name was rectum. Lasted 1 day. I am now famousamus
---
Good luck!
---
Agreed 100%.  I think in this case it was less about appeasing players and more about fixing an error in translation from Vanilla to Classic.
---
Well, they’re humanoids so they drop coin and cloth. Idk how much compared to other humanoids but they range from level 40-44~ so it’s a decent place to grind.
---
You are a god amongst men
---
cringe
---
Find a dungeon you can grind. Deadmines might be an option around 40. RFC probably isnt worth the time. Not sure about Wailing Caverns.
---
During BC I had those exact same boots drop for me when I was on my warrior.
---
It felt so damn hype
---
And you can be sure I kept them equipped for a while.
---
was it artherian? lol I just partied with someone saying my name was similar
---
Don't feel bad. Some people got ahead of the curve and had a lot of time on their hands. PvP slows people down considerably if you're in the pack too.
---
They won't be exactly the same but they'll be similar. Check [here](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/) for a nice database of pet info.
---
absolute mad lad
---
If you're not first you're last.
---
not completely sure.    he was wearing engineering googles
---
I wasn't tanking. The night elf hunter actually insisted I just stand next to the healer to make sure they don't get hit. I was going for more of a 2-H dps than a tank. I didn't put any points into protection. The Night Elf was level 25....i'm sure he could have found something more level appropriate for himself.
---
I see plenty on Kurinnaxx, usually on the receiving end of 3-5 alliance. Made my time in Ashenvale a bit of a redemption run from all the ganking in Hillsbrad, melting all 20-30s I could find. Gotta start the cycle somehow!
---
I am 2boxing but not using programs that utilize both at the same time. Leading with the warrior and having a priest heal me in case shit goes down.  
---
I am still only level 14. But on 2 toons tho!
---
I dont get why people still take pictures of theirbwcreens with their phones...
---
Sort by item, from the top down.  But then the prices are all outta whack.
---
I don't care either way. They would probably have lost if they did race. Which they didn't.
---
What? It is just a threat meter.
---
Why is Guy to the right sitting 50feet away from screen 🤣
---
Call it what describe it with as few letters as possible. Retail is perfect in that sense.
---
It's like hunt and peck typing.
---
Racing to 60? I just got level 18!
---
I have been for the past four years and still plan on doing so for the next two. Just with a different class this time.
---
Drain tanking is good for solo leveling etc. but not the best dps option for doing dungeons.
---
That’s free real estate!
---
So taunt is only effective if you do not already have aggro on a mob. If you already have aggro on a mob and then you taunt that mob the taunt is wasted and the threat could be lost. You’re taunt, and mocking blow, should be used when you lose threat of a specific mob and need to get it back in. Demo shout you can spam, so if it’s a group of multiple mobs you want to get them close and then keep spamming demo shout in between your basics generating rage. Battleshout also generates threat, but not as much. Obviously challenging shout well taunt all mobs around you but it has a 10 minute CD. You have to stack sunder multiple times in order for it to make you on top of the threat table. It stacks up to 5 times. Sunder is ideal for bosses or one or two mob pulls, any more and you are dumping your rage too quickly while not holding aggro on any one mob. Make sure you stay in your stance unless absolutely necessary to switch, ie mocking blow. You lose rage and threat when you switch stances.
---
A large chunk of East coast is having issues right now with Bnet
---
........ so yeah if ur east coast... just wait
---
It should wipe after you disband and reform the party. If it is somehow saved to you, just re-form with someone else as the group leader. There isn't a cap on how many times you can run the dungeons.
---
AoE Threat is terrible in Classic. You can *kind of* deal with it, but if you constantly lose entire groups to DPS, its that DPS's fault most of the time.
---
Solvable by DPS holding their DPS for a few GCD's, but GL with that, people just go ham right out of the gates. Often you kinda just gotta grit your teeth through it, which sucks.
---
TIL I am ip shadow banned because I can't log in. lol
---
Mount &gt; professions. You done goofed
---
Don't sit AFK with a new-tamed pet. They need feeding very frequently at that stage. If you have to, put it in the stable.
---
you didn't get shadow banned. most of the east coast is down. can't log in, connect to bnet or access bnet website. i use verizon fios.

Best I have seen was CmallSock

Wow a low health orc rogue kept /begging me and I kept /waving at him while walking away, saying don't worry, not gonna kill you.  He kept following me for a bit /begging and I was thinking wtf is up with this dude.
---
Now I realize he wanted me to sheep him.  I feel like an idiot.
---
I appreciate the concern, but I'm just saying dumb shit to that guy because he was unhelpful. I'm not ruling out the possibility that I'm really stupid and suck at this game, but at least I'm asking questions ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If hes east coast
---
We are all having issues atm, just got dc'd myself.... cant connect on all 3 of my accounts
---
Absolutely. It’s far easier than it looks. I died maybe 12 times getting the hang of it. 
---
The hardest part is the pull. Especially 
---
 with no Mount. I do “triangulation pills” where I wand one group of mobs, fire blast another, and run into the third in such a way that they all converge on my like a Venn diagram. Then you Frost Nova. 
---
- if you get a resist, you pretty much fucked in earlier levels because you mana pool is so small. You can poly, but I usually just reset the mobs if this happens. I’m running 2/3 Frost precision though, can’t recommend. 
---
Then you jump 3 times and flip around (max distance while in default blizzard range) and drag your blizzard reticle so the end is right where the mobs are standing. 3 blizzards is enough to kill most low level mobs. Any stragglers can be finished off by arcane explosion.
---
I am surprised I like it as much as I do, but I'm not quite infatuated with it - but I feel this is just because I really hate where I'm leveling (Barrens). What I DO get out of the experience though, is that now I understand why WoW was so successful. My 16 year old self did not see it the same way when it released 15 years ago. It all just makes sense now and I have a lot of MMOs worth of experience now to compare launches with.
---
Sounds familiar. Hillsbrad was an absolute warzone in vanilla. I don't think I've even nearly experienced as much PvP as I did there in the rest of the entire game including TBC and WOTLK questing in a PvP world.
---
Even in this ridiculous story OP is still the asshole. "I gave him food AND water", oh so he pressed 2 whole buttons at no cost to him? What a martyr. Then he tries to steal the egg from the shaman and aggros an enemy.
---
But since "shitshaman" is supposed to be the bad guy we end with him apologizing for not allowing OP to steal his quest item.
---
If you remove the dying aspect, warriors can clear areas pretty quickly thanks to charge. You have no mana to worry about, only your health bar. Get a hefty two-hander and you just blow your way through mobs, then fast zip over to the next one.
---

Me and my dungeon grind group are on our second staff of Jordan.
---
So you're happy as long as the people who are dungeon cleaving didn't play pre expansion wow? I guess that's a fair compromise
---
I'd say come to Grobbulus but there is some major drama with large guilds at the moment. It's common that RP servers have close knit communities and you don't have to RP to be part of them.
---
...welcome to the internet? This cannot be your first exposure to this. Thicken your skin, play your game, move on.
---
Yeah but it's one of those things. 
---
"You leveled a warrior to 60? And you got your rights of passage down. (cyclone axe or a reaper)"
---
You kind of set the impression you are committed. It's how you stand out in a guild, it's how you make friends because they will come to you.

Keep slaying, Muddog.

lulz
---
As a player that started @ WoW Launch with a Night Elf Hunter and stuck with her all the way up to WotLK launch, I have to say, some of the changes, I was happy to see.  Like pet leveling, or synching with character level.
---
Leveling your pet may sound like fun, at first.  But when you're level 60 or higher, and you go back to tame a level 10 pet, because you like the look / skin of a rare spawn, it took FOREVER to level it up to your level.  It really, REALLY sucked back in the day.

It has more pros than cons.
---
You'll only make money off the very rare enchants. And even then, it's a pain. There's no vallium, so you need to literally be present to sell your enchants. That means sitting AFK in IF/org spamming trade chat for a long period of time to try to get people to buy from you.
---
Trust me, I went tailoring/enchanting in vanilla, and I never changed because I got some rare patterns. But it's a huge money drain and does not pay off, generally, versus a standard gathering profession. The only way it pays off is if you're the first few enchanters to get some rare enchant.
---
One addendum is that disenchanting greens and selling the mats is often more profitable than vendoring. But if you're leveling enchanting, you're probably using the mats for leveling.
---
This time around, I'm going tailoring/herbalism. I figure it's better than skinning because at max level people will not need much leather but will still need a constant supply of herbs/potions/flasks. The only reason I didn't go skinning/herbalism is because the BiS BoP robe from tailoring. My alt (hunter) is skinning/herbalism.
---
&gt;Classic WoW PvE is easier than it was in Vanilla
---
I do understand where you're coming from, in the sense that when most guilds were progressing through MC and BWL they didn't have access to all the things that had been added into the game by 1.12.  Gear, talents, abilities, and encounter balance had all changed by then.  But since the game is based on that patch, the game is *exactly* as difficult as it was at that time.
---
I think that it would have been *acceptable* to tune MC a bit higher (even just increasing health pools by 5-10%), but I don't think it's *problematic* that they left it as it was.  MC doesn't have to be difficult.  We've got 4 more raids to get through afterwards, and most guilds won't be burning through any of them as easily as \&lt;APES\&gt;.

Yeah, and it is three times as bad when the zone is populated.

I was never attacked by a pack of kobolds, defias, or murlocs...I was always struggling to find some to tag!
---
Seems like you just got really unlucky with your guild choice. I personally would like to think there are plenty of "mature" guilds that will be a better fit for you. If I was in a guild and saw that type of immature talk I would honestly just /gquit and search for another.
---
There is definitely a lot of immature people that play this game, but from my experience there are definitely a lot more mature players. Unfortunately I do not think you will find any server with some immaturity but I wouldn't let it ruin your experience and I definitely wouldn't take anything said to heart.
---
Start looking for a more mature guild and I can guarantee you shouldn't have those types of experiences anymore :)

People expect to be carried a lot nowadays. If it were talked about then he'd have reason to be upset. But it's all on him. Happy questing!

You need therapy.

I am currently in a 7k queue on Mograine so this is just straight up untrue.

Ahh alright. I am just level 27, haven't joined the LFG channel or been in capital other than quick training so I hadn't actually heard of this before.

Wine has [prebuilt packages for Ubuntu](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu).

If i were you i would remove the manually built Wine completely, and then

1. install `libvulkan1` and `mesa-vulkan-drivers`

2. install Wine (Staging branch) as described in the link above

3. add [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) to the wineprefix

Or use Lutris.

Which one?

Yeah I know. It is not a shadowban.

Yes and no.  I played the game originally and quit after Siege of Orgrimmar in Pandas.  There is so much convenience added to the game which I still want.  This isn't the stuff like leveling faster, but the generic stuff like not having to go back and buy new ranks of abilities.  Even if I have to go back for the abilities initially, ok, but seeing a new rank of gouge adding 5 damage is the kind of pointless stuff I don't miss.  I don't miss poison charges and ammo and farming for fadeleaf to use blind.  This was all stuff I remember, and was glad they replaced.  I know why it is all back, but old stuff isn't better because it was original.  Stuff does get better.
---
The parts I am enjoying more is doing the classic stuff with an immensely greater knowledge of the game than playing original wow.  Aside from not knowing how any mechanics works when I was leveling, I didn't really know how too much worked overall even when raiding.  Going back and using what i know and how much better I became at the game is fun.
---
That Rogue gives the rest of us Rogues a bad name.  But alas, plenty of other players to group and have fun with, OP.
---
So give me the list of all of the mages in order on that website. Why do you talk so much but never link a single fucking thing to backup what you say?
---
we in it bois
---
means he can't get rez either
---
I wouldn't do that because you'll cause your Void Walker to ping-pong between mobs.  
---
What I did was create a macro `/macro` to make `/petattack` its own button on my action bar. That way I can "cast" my pets on whatever target I want, and switch them whenever I want without accidentally casting another spell. 
---
Importantly, I set my pet to passive. This effectively let me "manual" my pet instead of waiting for the "auto" in either "aggressive" or "defensive."
---
ROFL
---
Verizon FIOS east coast here, down for me too :(
---
This. Spread your high threat abilities around to multiple targets and save the taunt for when one breaks, slap a sunder and keep rotating. If you work groups that way it trains you to tab to one and interrupt or knock it down.
---
Well we are dead in the water.  I guess I'll go eat today, didn't plan on doing that.   Lmao
---
Right, but MC wasn't released with AQ, was it?
---
ayy same here! i left and haven't felt any need to go back
---
I've already had that happen. When I ran through RFC we had an undead mage that was being a dick, so I kinda made a note of him. Couple of days later when I'm assembling a group for WC, someone hits me up for a spot and who should it be but the dick mage himself. Needless to sa, he was not invited.
---
I completely agree with not rushing but I also do want to be reasonably efficient as I ALWAYS end up making alts and if I want to do that and get some semi-useable PvP gear, I need to stay not too far behind.
---
What I don’t understand is how the average player seems to be super-hardcore. I was expecting a handful of people to get up to 60 in a week but I’ve been really surprised to see myself fall so behind when I even took a day off work to play!
---
:v
---
Love these screen shots of blinding suns in games then people act like that makes the game beautiful lol
---
Look at this idiot jumping to conclusions.
---
So it's just east coast Fios users, that's so random and specific lol.
---
How long can we expect this to last?
---
As I get older I am starting to realize this more and more. So many people are alcoholics and our lives are ruled by drinking. I don't have a problem and only drink occasionally but thinking about giving it up all together.

I'm a fan of  [https://www.twitch.tv/llance](https://www.twitch.tv/llance) myself. If you wanna mindlessly watch the big streamers that's cool, do your thing, but I like interacting with them. Funny dude and interactive.
---
Obviously going 1-hand/shield when questing isn't as good as using a 2-hander. Depending on if it was a +str or +agi of course. Tanks and healers fill those rolls to complete the dungeon, so they can roll on their preferred spec gear if they want
---
Lovely day to bring out the tinfoil hat.
---
Sadly, I believe a lot of the new players are kids / immature adults. I don't see much of this on Horde in Kirtonos, although I do see some dumb stuff in barrens chat (but that's what Barrens chat is for) So if you feel comfortable with rolling horde, Kirtonos my guild is always looking for long term dedicated players, and we also have a mature environment so that we don't have problems like this arise in our chat. Hope you can find an enjoyable permanent place to enjoy your play!
---
What?... Nothing
---
wait, I'm on FIOS and on East Coast, my friend is still playing but he's not on FIOS.
---
Yeah its EU on Golemag
---
\#showtooltip definitely works. are you using any addons that might inhibit this somehow?
---
what sort of macros have you tried this on?
---
try a very simple one to rule out any other issue, i.e.
---
&gt;\#showtooltip  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;/cast Rejuvenation
---
if you are using a lot of conditionals or cast sequences, the game may perhaps have difficulty on which tooltip to show, in which case you can specify, i.e.
---
&gt;\#showtooltip \[help\] Rejuvenation \[harm\] Wrath  
---
&gt;/cast \[help\] Rejuvenation \[harm\] Wrath
---
Well down, but the sceptical bastard in me thinks you’ve just jumped in front of someone else’s kill and took the credit, you almost had me until you said you were a paladin.

Unfortunately elemental is going to be looked at as a meme spec. Try leveling as enhance. End game you may be expected to go resto. It all really depends on where you land in a group/guild.

Nice! Now start you Lupos camping. Might want to bring a tent and train Cooking for the campfire...

I was under the impression that the damage boost from sacrificing the succubus usually ended up as the same DPS as leaving it out to DPS on it's own.

I’m pretty sure you’re wasting your Taunt. It doesn’t have any effect if the target is already attacking you. It doesn’t generate extra threat unless it’s attacking someone else.

Aw shucks. Maybe I can find an addon that replicates it. Thanks for your help!

It is important to note that this relies heavily on having improved blizzard talents, the additional chill one and frost nova ones help a lot too.

Thanks for the info.

Naysaying is my kink

You should try to sell/vendor your greens and sell your cloth or make into bags/useful tailoring items and sell.  Grinding mobs does churn out more vendor trash to sell, but for me it's too mind numbing.  I'd rather quest and gather it later.

That's ignorant

The fact that 'scrub' is your go-to response, despite knowing literally nothing about me while thinking, somehow, that being able to AOE grind makes you good just goes to prove my point.

Currently leveling my own Shaman. Having a lot of fun, just hit 20 and got ghost wolf! Do you have any tips at all?

I've also heard that 2H and Rockbiter is the best way to go, but why is it? When is it better?

CPC breaks stuff down by level 1-60 with a graph. So, on my realm, there's over 3k lvl 1s, but the 'bell curve' is around lvl 20; with me being lvl 25 (which makes up about ~2% of the total surveyed population). - The addon still being developed so creator may add filters.

&gt;Surely there's a quality pizzeria in your area you could support.

I ran into a similar situation with a mage while out doing an elite quest. Used spells seemingly at random, wanded when he has plenty of mana, and would run around picking up extra elites we didn't need. Then got shocked when I booted him.
---
you make so much gold questing around lvl 40. Even if you don't have it at 40 you'll have it at 42ish easy

Take some time off and grow as a human being.

Medium sold at 17s yesterday on the AH. I'd  at least check before vendoring. Think it's worth to spend those 30c per stack to just send it your auction alt hand have a quick look. Also keeps inventory clean when leveling.

Shamans work best as healers in end game pve. The hybrid ele/resto spec is great in solo and group pvp.

Take a look at the youtube video called shamans. were they any good though.
---
I skipped deadmines and stockade as horde and I’m doing perfectly fine.

pve - players can choose to toggle a pvp flag, non-pvp players are safe in neutral zones.

pvp - go to a neutral zone at your own peril.

You can have a lvl 60 while still being casual, we are talking years down the road

Back in Vanilla my friends and I had a gold name of 'Shaking Babies' we were all rogues with different variants of SIDS for character names...sidz, syds, sydz... so on... we got renamed to 'Bobby likes Tacos'... we kept the name and just yelled "TACOS" at the start of every battleground.
---
Um...yes, how is this even a question? Ally do DM, horde do WC. Some people like to run the other factions dungeons for kicks and giggles, but nothing in these dungeons is inherently worth the pain, and you are unable to get the major questline for the opposing faction's dungeon.
---
using Fios?

Maybe you just don’t get on his server and deal with the market inflation that simple guy maybe you should just play wow instead of bitching at people making a 15 year-old game fun. Hell I would abuse that system to if I had the time to run all around on wow.

This one trick will change your whole WoW experience:  kill mobs on your way to the quest site, don't just gingerly skirt around them and then high-tail it when you accidentally aggro one.
---
My buddy sent me a video of the first person to reach 60. I really didn’t understand what the hype was about? I genuinely feel that the release of Classic was meant to be a nostalgic experience, not something to be rushed...
---
Yeah, "hating thots" is the epitome of humour and comedy.
---
Going oom can be the healers fault. It’s important to bundle heals then take a pause to let spirit regen kick in. Continuously casting low rank heals can be bad as can casting mana-expensive spells like Holy Shock or PW: Shield.
---
yah most of the "Stuff to do" at 60 is coming in phase 2 and 3
---
no reason to rush at ALL yet... took me 2 days to figure it out (oh i was rushing) 
---
but since then... ive had a lot more fun just taking my time
---
Get better DPS
---
I think Perl might have an option for health to be displayed by a number, but I know that vuhdo and healbot have options to show health as a number, or even just the deficit (ie, 150/200  health would report as -50)

I’m also curious of this
---
I'm only lvl 32. I requested the week off of launch and the last few days I really had to step away from the game lol. 
---
I love it, and getting to play with my husband has made this experience even better than before, but too much makes me mad that I can't really kill things on my own in Arathi.

 /join world
---
*chuckles in Wookie*
---
Yeah it's sad because like I said, I played in the beta with streamers and people who chose to play on the same server as streamers, and had 0 problems, they were all super friendly and welcoming. In fact they were infinitely more friendly than when I played WoW retail. And the streamers would organize fun world events and I had lots of fun, I was really excited for release and was hoping it would be the same. It's sad that it is not :(
---
What psychopath is even casting shadowbolt on trash? Wait 5+ seconds for the tank to get aggro. DoT anything with a sunder, Tap once or twice, wand and afk.
---
It sounds like you're always using your max-rank heals? That could be why you're going OOM on regular pulls.
---
Yeah around level 12 I was struggling so I took a break and played the AH. Now at level 16 I have 4g and pretty nice lowbie gear and life is much easier. Also took up first aid and cooking. Got a gun for pulls. It's bearable now. I can actually pull multiple mobs and not die.
---
As a bear tank I’ll throw a rejuv on the lock that tapped before pulling for the extra heal threat and since I usually have mana to spare anyway.
---
I've been killing mages when all their mobs are low so I can steal them.
---
It’s cool I’m a shaman my tank was 28 for rdk so a bit low his taunts never worked so I tanked all the bosses we had 0 wipes
---
yeah, there's a decent quest chain, but if you're on a pvp server chances are you'll spend more time brawling.
---
I use to have an systemic lag issue with HotS, turned out to be something wonky between my ISP and the Chicago HotS server. I found a way to block the server IP so I always wound up on another one and the lag issues were fixed.

---
do you act out your deaths in full sound?
---
A good rule of thumb is to never renew because it is so bad
---
It has uses but you can discover those after you've accepted that 99% of the time it is a waste of mana
---
&gt;  I don't know, man, but it keeps me up at night
---
Oh. Uh... yeah.
---
Give this guy a medal. This is the difference. 
---
Retail gives you chores you must do to enjoy the game. Classic gives you tonnes of things you can do but was designed around the idea that the journey is very much a part of the experience.
---
I’m not trying to flex someone else’s E dick. I can’t make an alliance character so I can’t check.  It’s purely out of curiosity, if all his grinding earned him that or not.  Just asking a question, no need to be hostile.

28 Orc Rogue checking in.  Happy with my slow and steady progress.  Taking plenty of breaks to travel to westfall and redridge to gank Alliance.  You’re welcome!
---
Disable experience gains and finish everything possible at low levels, just for the challenge of it.  When you run out of things to do, go up a couple levels and see what else you can do.  Games are supposed to be fun
---
How am I not being victimized by a player in my server, EXPLOITING LAYERING TO GET AN ADVANTAGE???
---
Lmao “hate thread”
---
I didn't know Ally even did WC because it would be just a hassle to get to, that's why you have DM and Stockades and BFD
---
Time to re-roll 😉
---
Hey, at least he did not take a photo of it using his cell phone.
---
That shit makes me irate.
---
I got to level 30 last night and I left for vacation this morning. So yeah, I’m forced to slow down :/
---
just get into the habit of clearing everything and pulling shit back. It's xp right there for you and if you plan it right you can keep the rage flowing. Learn to kite mobs if you pull too many, and always keep some health pots for a last resort. Don't forget your cooldowns like retaliation, and throw a 2h wep on when you pop it with a macro.
---
And that is called "balance".
---
I'm level 22.  I've been using my highest level Heal as primary heal and Flash Heal as a lesser heal.  Should I be doing something different?  Depending on the group, past WC I've had issues running out of mana during fights, but it could just be that I'm on the lower end for BFD.
---
Fios east coast also. FML
---
Is this a meme to try to take the shittiest cell phone pictures?
---
Sad day. Guess it's part of the challenge of classic.
---
sincere question here - which specific murloc(k)s are you talking about? And what level, etc?
---
I’ve found the whole zone hard so far, every quest seems to be red or orange!
---
Been playing in a stack of 5 with old friends, going around together, having fun, teasing and picking at eachother, embracing the suck of some parts of the game and relishing others. We have just commited to a guild and are working on getting some special drops we each want (crimson whelpling i'm coming for you) and taking our own pace as a team. I wouldn't want anything else
---
Stop, get some help. There’s no point in such self inflicted pain.
---
You needed to swim farther over.  There are two areas that cut in like that.  You have to go to the second one.
---
Rogue you want to be up close and personal.  If you don't down your enemy in a few seconds you'll want to get out.  *note this isnt kn regards to PvE*
---
2 days and 7 hours /played. I'm level 27, halfway to 28.
---
I'm chillin'
---
Echeyakee?
---
I don't think hit or expertise were removed till after reforging was taken to the guillotine
---
Cant really point out bad players as toxic behavior because...well...that's just being toxic.
---
At low levels most classes can only 1v1. 
---
Later on you can do more. Especially with evasion/potions etc...
---
Can confirm. Power shield is my panic button
---
Same here, 30, and I cringe hardcore at anyone using "boomers"
---
Uh, no shit?
---
What were those tips on AoE farming.  Was thinking about respeccing but I don't wanna eat the gold cost so soon.
---
How the fuck is the russian bot not banned yet? Just promoting this BS boosting crap.
---
STR is 2.4 AP/point
---
Improved Blizzard -- adds a chill effect to the spell
---
Permafrost -- lengthens chill time and increases speed reduction
---
Frostbite (I think) -- adds chance to root to chill effect
---
These are the core tools in the AoE grind toolkit. Every hit of the Blizzard can proc the root. If RNGesus smiles on you, the pack of mobs just sits there and dies.
---
I replaced one of my dots with a macro of
---
/petAttack
---
/Cast Immolate
---
You can do this with any of your spells and your pet will act a bit more like the assist mode you are used to from retail. Down side is multi dotting can reset your pets target. Which is why I did it on immolate, as the cast time makes it more deliberate and I can multidot with the instants freely.
---
So don't worry that their are level 60's and you only level 7... it'll be ok!
---
When you have your pet out you'll have an extra tab at the bottom of your screen if you open your character screen up for your pet. If you mouse over its stats it should tell you attack speed, ap and crit chance.
---
So, gold farmers swapping layers to mine nodes aren't exploiting in your eyes?
---
In my mind, I would want the sword and board for the block/shield bash ability more than just taunt and revenge.
---
why are you AOE tanking?
---
\-use crowd control to pull 2 mobs ideally, 3 max. 
---
\-mark your targets and focus on one at a time
---
\-maul main targets with swipes in between
---
\-thorns, Regrowth+renew yourself, pull with wrath/moonfire (you can wrath one target, moonfire a second, then switch to bear)
---
What you know that was funny?
---
What level were you?
---
This might be the error that no one else has described.  I had been using a ? icon for other things like the wand shoot macro, /startattack, and /tar.  But I wanted to tell them apart, so I started choosing the icon from the list for the next macros I made after this.  
---
Not selecting the ? icon may be why my #showtooltip at the top of my spell casting macros is only showing the macro name and not the actual spell details.
---
TIL--thanks!

10000% agree, and of it works for them so be it,but it's goes against how we are taught to type, home keys are home keys for a reason.  After like 1 day playing this way, It has felt smoother ever since.

I wish you good fortune in the wars to come

stonetalon gave me a lot of wool
---
Man I could feel something was wrong I kept not having energy for stuff after a tick.. now it all makes sense. I hope it is fixed soon.
---
The best thing is taking the time to level all your professions at the same time, it's so satisfying and not boring. Rushing is the best way to quit the game as soon as you hit 60. 
---
I'm level 18 and had so many interactions with people, things I would never experienced rushing 60 by spamming dungeon with my friends 24/7.
---
That community is so awesome ! Let's chill together !
---
That combo is less healing for more mana than just casting heal. It also takes 2 GCDs instead of 1, meaning you lose an additional 1.5 seconds of mana regen.
---
You really should only be using heal except for emergencies.
---
Imagine taking pvp so seriously in a casual MMO where there is no money to be made while there are a myriad of other more prestigious competitive games that better test skill and teamwork and have much higher monetary rewards.  I guarantee the money I won in my counter-strike days is greater than whatever you might have earned stroking your dick over your pvp rank in a casual MMO.
---
Not to be rude, but this is not retail, and literally the only difference between a level 10 resto, feral, and balance druid is a single talent point at the top of the tree.  Sure, it gets more pronounced later on, but early on and even up to max level, stacking stats on your gear is what turns you into a healer, not your spec.  You have your full baseline kit with any spec, and speccing only adds some passives and a couple of actual spells that set you apart from other specs.
---
I healed dungeons with 30 points in feral at lvl 60.  I just use full int/spirit gear instead of agi/str.  Learn how to use the healing spells you have, conserve your mana, not overheal, and get regen going with spirit.  I think I was 21/30 resto/feral for most of OG Classic.  You can do cat, bear, or healer mode with that spec.  You end up with three distinct gear sets but such is the life of a druid.
---
This is one of the things I've come to hate most about retail: first they pruned abilities from classes, then they even stripped out spells from specific specs that had been baseline since forever.  Why can some mages not polymorph?  What madness is this?  Polymorph should be a core mage spell.  It goes all the way back to WC2, and any mage that can't poly is not a mage. /rant

I had a tough time killing more than 1 mob until lvl 20 or so. I found that weapons make a huge difference in terms of damage for rogues, so make sure you keep them updated.

Just wanted to play for an hour today. Started the computer, logged in, 84 minutes queue, turned off the computer...
---
As a lvl 23 Warrior, I have to wait 17 levels before I can go fast :))))))
---
Yeah, it's pretty bad, especially when the best spots are also quest areas. Jokerd layer hopped to keep that down. I'm just staying ST Frost until around 40 when i can just AoE in instances.
---
No the wall, yes to THRALL!
---
Yeah made my first alt (Paladin) after getting my hunter to LVL 22. I'm not racing, but I wish I wasn't at work lol
---
he whispered me saying I made him die of laughter irl so yes
---
Rogues are weak early
---
Honestly, all of the instancing in WoW is incredible, not just the endgame raids. Things like Deadmines, SFK, Scarlet Monastery, Gnomeregan... I rarely quest to level after I hit 16. I just instance over and over and over until I'm 60. 
---
The thing about the instances is that they're balanced just right on difficulty, where a group that plays well together will breeze through and a group that plays poorly will fail; and the XP and gear rewards fall off quickly enough that people rarely have an incentive to run them after they become easy. Deadmines is a 17-25 zone, but I usually start running it at 16 and am done by 21, because it's no longer worth it.

---
Going to rating was necessary to prevent lvl 40 gear from being BiS. I think that was one of the cool things in vanilla that went away, but I can understand its removal in later expansions.
---
I used to tank with an add-on called tidy plates threat plates. I might be insane and making this up, but I'm nearly positive it had % threat on the nameplate so you could proactively gain more threat rather than just reacting to lost aggro. Anyone able to confirm this?
---
I had a fetch quest and, by myself, got stuff to drop every kill. With a party though, I would get a drop every 4th or 5th kill. Just confused on why that would be the case.
---
Looks like something to avoid joining.
---
Yikes, that's pretty rough I haven't played WoW in almost 10 years, so prior to Classic, I dicked around on a private shard for a memory refersher. (Also to get caught up on the opposing faction I'm playing, and a new class) and one of the things I identified was NOT to respec since it uses up so much gold! I've been able to stay true to that, and plan on it, regardless of what happens.
---
Glad you've having fun though, that's what it's all about!
---
They are a bit easier then warrior. When you are solo questing you should do your best at all times to try to pull things 1 by 1. Also being classic every class needs to stay on top of there weapons to maximize damage, but also so they don't ball behind when it comes to damaging.  Gear matters a lot, but weapon is key to doing the best damage you can. Also you can use bow,gun, throwing weapon in your ranged slot. You can use that to range pull.
---
The content while leveling isn't particularly interesting either. The lore is dull and the quest objectives repetitive. Can't wait for the next quest to send me across the zone for 5 minutes for 700xp, truly engaging gameplay. I installed Azeroth Autopilot and Questie on day one, that way the pathing is at least somewhat optimized but still horrific by modern standards. The only somewhat redeeming aspect of leveling is killing players of the opposite faction knowing they have to corpse run for 5 minutes.
---
&gt;I’m just pointing out I don’t think they know what they want.
---
Imagine posting this on a fucking Wow Classic forum and being taken seriously.
---
This is just a reminder for everyone out there... no need to be a jerk.
---
What makes you think I’m always mad at something?
---
I can’t tell you how to play either class, but rogues can equip throwing knives. Toss one st a caster and then duck being an obstacle. This will cause them to lose line of sight in you and run to your location without casting anything. Then boom the are in melee range, you beat them up and kick them in the face when they try to cast.
---
Didn't read just blocked ya.  Have fun playing the same content you've been playing for years LOL
---
Same here I'm level 31 👍
---
I am levelling a prot warrior Needmorerage - Thunderfury, currently level 29. I also started a mage and a hunter, but stopped them in favour of the warrior. I am enjoying it the most, probably because I am not trying to rush through the content. I am doing it as slow as possible, as this, for me, is the endgame. Also levelling professions along the way. I also went to instances a lot.
---
These are my instance counts so far
---
|Deadmines|4|
---
|:-|:-|
---
|Stockades|1|
---
|Blackfathom Deeps|3|
---
|Shadowfang Keep|1|
---
For what it's worth, every class works with every spec in both retail and classic.  It's more a matter of how effectively they work.  In retail mythic/heroic raiding, you're expected to spec a certain way in order to maximize effectiveness just like in classic raiding.  That part of the game will never change.
---
works fine for me. 
---

only risk is if a scammer or bot is using the same IP as the one your VPN is using. If they ban the ip of the bot, you'd also get caught in that wave.
---
With gouge and kick caster mobs shouldn't really be a problem at all. But yeah, rogues do struggle a bit early on especially when pulling multiple mobs. The more tools you get the easier it gets though.

Imagine if the roles were reversed and the majority of gamers were women and the stigma was men dont play videogames, and then all of a sudden a dude posts this crap. Find a different community, draw less attention to the fact that you don't have a penis and more to the fact that you're playing a game, I really think you're over dramatic because I know girls who play this game with zero issues, maybe develop thicker skin or learn to ignore the internet.
---
Rogues are similar, it isn't you.
---
The drop rate stays the same so its RNG, who gets the loot off the dead mob alternates, so player 1 gets kill #1 , player 2 gets kill #2, player 1 gets kill #3 and so on. it does add an extra "RNG" step to it, the kill must be yours and it must drop the item.
---
You can always put the loot on Free for all and each member loot their own kill and gets the loot off of that mob making essentially like playing solo but with shared XP. altho if you are playing with strangers nothing stops them from stealing your loot.
---
It will abandon if you don't feed it long enough, the more you level with it the more trained it gets and less you actually need to feed it but it can still leave
---
Burning steppes most likely
---
How slow is spamming dungeons comparatively? If it's that difficult to solo quest?
---
Select dwarf as priest for fear ward
---
As a level 32 warrior, can confirm it doesnt get easier. Still working on getting my whirlwind axe, but it's hard with the boss being a level 40 elite.
---
It basically goes in a round robin for loot.  This doesn't dictate how often an item drops though.  Drop rates have static percentages.
---
You think I am being a jerk? For knowing the obvious?

You are a tender one, aint ya?

The classic you are playing right now is build upon the engine that BfA uses. BfA was build on the engine that once vanilla used, but heavily modified.
---
I am not exactly sure why you have such a hard time to understand that.
---
If your ally the main one I can think of is a scarlet dude in the inn in desolace. He has you kill some undead in a valley and then gives you the quest for sm.

\*Leaves group\*
---
I think it because anyone can get to 17+ to do WC without much effort. people are still figuring out how social interactions are supposed to work in dungeons at that point as there is really only one other dungeon they've likely done. By the time you hit sunken temple, they've done so many runs that dungeon behavior is usually sorted out. between that and being willing to accept that you'll run every dungeon a couple of times to finish everything makes people all-around more fun to dungeon with once they get past the first couple.

My first 60 was a warrior that I only spent time grinding with. Keep in in mind- I was a kid that just came off Diablo: grinding is al I knew.

I didn’t learn until later that there were other methods.
---
I read online that warlock's main stat is Intellect. But the guide is also saying to run a DoT build (which I wanted to do).
---
However intellect only gives crit and mana, and as far as I can tell, DoTs don't crit... am I missing something here?

I'm 32, thank your for your comment and for have great reading comprehension.

Just remember the toon name. Keep a little book.

Guaranteed as a healer, he will need you long before you need him - and you can just say no.
---
I mean, if someone accidentally pulls a mob trying to get a node I'm not gonna call them a ninja looter, that's a bit extreme. They just misjudged, I do it all the time out in the world.
---
I think a flower spawning at a boss is such a rare occurrence that it isn't even an issue.
---
If you hold everything else equal, this is basically 2% less healing the healers have to do.

I have a daugher now, almost a year old. I was off Thursday - Monday and managed to get to level 20 and that was only playing after my daughter was to bed, and my wife went to bed. And of course with me trying to stay up until 3-4am trying to get the most of my night time gaming sessions. I’m like 5-7 levels behind some of my friends/ guildies but i don’t necessarily feel like i need to rush to try and catch them. I have had more positive interactions in these 20 levels than i have between legion / bfa combined. Added friends. Gave random players i quested with hard earned potions i made, stayed after i completed a quest to help someone else finish. All things i don’t remember doing. Aka questing is enjoyable and doesn’t feel like you gotta hurry to get through it to enjoy the content.
---
3 days 7 hrs and some time was spent helping a low lvl warr buddy level!

What % is this sped up, this is rad.

only 15 on my pally. Same path I took 15 or so years ago. Started speccing ret, again. It will hurt me, but oh well.
---
All those mobs patting around. While you are trying to get that last remaining roguefeather, or slaloming through all the mobs to plant that damn seed.
---
I've always hated that specific spot, yet never skipped it.
---
Shows your debuffs on enemy nameplates(with timers), shows enemy cast bars and changes the color of enemy nameplates based on threat. It's extremely useful when you're tanking multiple mobs.
---
Regular mount costs 90G if you have honored reputation with them.  
---
Shouldn't be too expensive.
---
Try marking the targets before a pull. Most people will automatically target the skull first. That will give you some time to build up threat on the other targets.
---
Is that Gurloc of Old Blanchy?
---
Nah, this ain't it fam.

The whole purpose of buying the boat in the first place was to get the ladies nice and tipsy top side, so we can take them to a nice comfortable place below deck, and you know, they can't refuse...because of the implication.

Level 17 and enjoying the hell out of chilling in towns and outposts talking with other players and forming relationships with people I will bump into again and again. Love Classic! Havnt felt like I have had this much freedom in a game for a long time!
---
I totally forgot this, and was promptly reminded this weekend lol
---
Agreed, imagine sitting there racing to level 60.
---
That's a yikes for me too, bud.
---
What ui Addon is that? Looks nice
---
Noob question, how long can vanilla sustain without new content do you think?   The average player will eventually max out and quit no?
---
Combat is a PvE spec pretty exclusively.  Sure you can beat someone down but the rogue toolkit from the other spec trees is way better for PvP.
---
I'm confused are a lot of people really doing MC already? If they are, is the attunement quest line not in the game? Cause I remember that taking a fuck ass long time to do, Or maybe I just have a bad memory of that from 14 years ago
---
I have Lieutenant's Insignia in my backpack, but it seems like I've completed the quest. There is no "Hidden enemies" in my quest log, and I 100% sure I've took that quest and didn't abandoned. Is that a bug?
---
This is awesome advice thank you!
---
I can hold my own 1v2 and sometimes 1v3 against enemies my level as a priest thanks to my trusty turret (wand). It does more DPS than my main damaging spells so I can same my mana for self heals.
---
I'm leveling as fury, so I don't get to keep the rage. But yeah, with TM, it's better to just swap and save the rage.
---
same, never got a 19 tick, and 21 ticks are predictable.
---
last night on the WA discord, someone was trying to make a 5sr WA with mana ticks also being counted through, and they noticed that mana ticks weren't every 2 seconds, but every 2.03 seconds. assuming the same tick rate for energy, 4 ticks at 2.03 seconds per tick is 8.12 second or 81 energy, so 3 ticks of 20 and a fourth tick of 21. 
---
so it seems like there's just an issue with how regen works, in that it regens at a slightly longer tick rate than thought previously. maybe that's actually how it worked in vanilla, but ticks gave power back based on a calculated amount per tick at 2 seconds, when it was actually 2.03 seconds. but this could also just be a systemic issue.
---
Make that double with prep and premed cold blood build
---
right there with you, sticking with my human warlock
---
We will.  We'll kick their teeth in, then go back to each other's throats a moment later.
---
You’re basically level 70
---
Grind mobs for some of your levels. Its often even more efficient than questing depending on your progress in the zone and your level. If you only do quests youll eventually be underleveled at some point during the zone, so finishing a level or two on mobs that drop good vendor loot or are around gathering nodes will significantly boost your coin while still leveling at a decent pace
---
8 is bullshit btw. Some tanks genuinely might not know how to pull a dungeon, but know how to tank. As a priest back in the first days of Vanilla, I would sometimes have to take over pulling because I knew how to separate the packs, where to LOS pull etc. I let the tank try at first, but if I saw issues arising because he was failing pulls I would SW:P the kill target and drag them to him or LOS them to him. They would often adapt and learn to grab things off me and the run would be smooth and sometimes even be saved because of it. 
---
DPS should not pull because they are in a rush, but there is no reason a dps can't use creative methods  to pull if they know the dungeon the best. The tank doesn't always need to be the leader.
---
In order of hardest to easiest:  Warrior &gt; Rogue &gt; *POWER GAP* &gt; Shaman = Priest = Paladin &gt; Mage &gt; Druid &gt; *POWER GAP* &gt; Warlock &gt; Hunter
---
im only lvl 32 but i started collecting int gear very early on.  able to heal dungeons no problem as enhance, and it's a lot easier to find groups as healer than dps.  plus I'll be resto endgame so might as well get some practice in.
---
The key with melee is just to outlevel the mobs a little bit. If you’re 25, killing 27s can be tough, but killing 23s is pretty easy. 
---
It’s well worth the time investment to just grind some humanoids a level or two below you for a level or two every 10 levels or so...will make your life so much easier.
---
I don't experience this. Do you have some kind of addon issue?
---
I remembered spell rotations and that’s about it.
---
Shadowmeld is clutch if you need to afk, too.
---
Well, if you got in early enough to exploit the ten mans, you're head and shoulders above the rest. Unbelievable blizzard let this go for as long as they did.
---
Early on you gonna struggle till around lvl 22.Use sap as much as you can too just remember it will take you out of stealth compared to retail
---
You need to hit 60 ASAP or people get so elitist about who they bring to groups
---
Hahah was running RFC with a guy named Kumshots and he got hit with the ban right before the final boss
---
How do you handle warlocks who drain their own life to do god know what to their pets?
---
I checked for him a few times when I'd have to go through barrens but never saw him. Now I've been grinding near broken tooth for several hours and haven't seen him yet. Guess I'll have to wait for a cool pet.
---
They are, but I'm just slow and bad. I did maybe 4 hours of random exploring, and spent another 5 in Red Ridge dealing with Gath lol.
---
Maybe it'll go faster now that I'm done with that horrid area.
---
Yeah his life is WoW. Needs to get out more.
---
Oh my the purists would riot.
---
Nice congrats on 40. Yea that's a good plan you should be able to get a solid 35-50g out of it depending on your server's economy.
---
High effort meme
---
and even then, it went down for about 15 minutes.
---
Nothing wrong with turning the other cheek for sure. Great advice.
---
It's probably not a bad idea to have your main at 60 by phase 2 if you're playing on a pvp server, for sure.
---
Imagine caring about how other people enjoy a video game
---
that's a liopleurodon charlie!
---
I plan to get him again as well on my alt (level 13). Hoping for luck as good as yours. Currently using The Rake.
---
And preach religion. &lt;3
---
Yep
---
Yeah, that really blows my mind. I feel like I am playing quite a bit and I just hit 20, right when I thought I would based on my time played. If I took time off work and blew off my social engagements I think I would likely be maybe @ level 40 by now. It blows my mind that people have reached 60 or are even in their 50s. They have a.) A lot of endurance for playing games 12+ hours a day and b.) Not much going on except for WoW.
---
I don't get why I don't have rage? I'm plently pissed off as it is.
---
Oh okay, seems we agree then!
---
That's exactly how I played vanilla, up to the point where I never really raided at all. Just leveled a ton of characters. Currently trying to focus solely on my shammy this go-around
---
Nah, the problem is that people are trying way too hard for a fucking level 30-38+ dungeon
---
I am not playing but I like to watch it on stream
---
Oof you're getting dumber by the second.
---
But its so much fun to read!
---
I'm leveling multiple toons at the same time so I expect the ride to last quite a long time. I intend on having a nice, diverse crew of characters for every potential situation. May take me forever but I'm in no rush.
---
That would be a really good way of doing it, I know a ton of people itching to play TBC or WotLK again. I'd play WotLK for sure
---
Does anyone know how to work the stopwatch in classic? You can open the stopwatch by clicking on the clock on the minimap, but I can’t figure out how to get it to count down. On retail, the macro:
---
/sw 30
---
/sw start
---
Would have it count down from 30 seconds, but these commands don’t work in classic.
---
Don't even need TM with a macro.  It charges and immediately swaps, you get to keep the rage from charge.
---
I am disappointed ni the horde on your server for not hearing about this on your crossteam discord and ganking you.
---
Downvote this garbage so people stop doing it.
---
Lol is that what you think? 
---
Potions/consumes = 200g+/week
---
Edgemasters handguards 1200g+
---
Alcor’s Sunrazor 800g+
---
Teebus 2000g+
---
+31 healing or +21 spell damage green wand 1500g+
---
Hide of the Wild 300g+
---
BiS enchants 300g-500g+ 
---
Thorium Brotherhood exalted 2000g+
---
Flask recipes 1000g+
---
Exalted any faction 500g+
---
This is the most important aspect when talking about minor differences in gear.
---
You kind of just agreed with me that you also just skin what's on the way.. I also had like 2g at 14.
---
If that was the case and a guy posted this, I would be empathetic because it's silly that someone should be treated poorly and made to feel unwelcome just because they happen to be a man or woman. You shouldn't have to hide something as inconsequential as what gender you are in a video game just because you will be treated poorly because of it.
---
And also, if you even bothered to read the story I posted, I never even said I was a woman in my guild, not even once. They assumed I was based on something I said, and then proceeded to say all kinds of awful stuff about women and said that women should get out. How do you suggest I avoid that?

---
It's difficult to recommend any pet in particular. Do you like fast-attacking DPS monster that relies on big crits? Go with a cat. Tank pet that can take a lot of punishment? Bear, boar or turtle.
---
Every pet family has its perks. Just depends on what you want out of your pet.
---
that is the glory of RNG sometimes you get lucky sometimes you don't.  Boars in Westfall, for example, has a 28% chance to drop boar ribs 
---
So if you killed 60 to get 32 thats a pretty good rate,  53% drop rate actually that was pretty lucky basic math says you should have at least killed 29 boars per player to get that. but again if you are unlucky you could kill 29 and not get 1 its all random
---
Until you get to rugged leather yes. You can set aside a few heavy leathers to sell, tailors need 2 each for silk bags. But yeah, just vendor it, no one is buying it atm. Leatherworking is the least popular crafting prof and most LWs have tons of their own mats from leveling.
---
Does Questie not do this?
---
Hey thanks for responding - is this conversation more lively on the discord? I wasn't aware there was a classic hunter discord.
---
In fairness, you have reminded me of some stuff there that I had completely forgotten. That being said, most of it is not compulsory.
---
To add, get improved blizzard to max for 65% speed reduction
---
Supposedly added in 1.11 according to the only source I saw earlier, but the only people ahead of me are skipping ST afaik...
---
They might not be in this phase, as a shadow priest that makes me very sad.
---
I think you'd have to be pretty dang efficient to reach level 40 within a week!
---
Dedication. I like it.
---
Level 1: Can't wait until I'm level 60 ASAP.  
---
Level 10: Damn, this grind is harder than I thought.  
---
Level 20: I think I'm going to take it easy and enjoy the process.
---
I don’t think he should accept summons if he’s “ultimate Ironman”. Any outside help should be denied. I don’t even think he should be rolling on loot in dungeons. Can only use gear he gets via world drops while solo.
---
Just go to a lower pop realm and you won't have a queue pretty much ever. You may have chosen a highly populated one and logged in during a peak hour. Queues will die down over time as they have been over the last week, closer to launch they were at 4-5 hours+ on some realms.
---
Was on Incendius with 3 friends, then took one of those friends to Pagle to play with my other friends.  We all agreed to check out Pagle and my friend's guild, they all said it was a good idea, none of them (except one) came to check it out.  Now they're all mad we decided to stay.
---
I started playing towards the end of Vanilla as well and didn’t do Vanilla end game either.  I did farm ZG to try to get the mounts during WotLK, and fell in love with the raid.  Can’t wait to do it for real this time around.
---
I play a rogue.  If the group is good and I want to play with them again, you bet I'll open that chest and /roll.  If I get a frustrating group... we'll see.  Thankfully that hasn't happened yet.
---
ShareX gang
---
Nope these posts are bullshit.  Everyone here needs to aknowledge this basic fact. 
---
Classic wow FORCES players to socialize.  It's required if you ever wanna make any real progress.  
---
Retail wow does not force it therefore no one socialized.    
---
This was accomplished through game mechanics  and a lack of modern QoL features like  auto queues for dungeons and raids etc...   
---
Gamers tend to play however is the most efficient ND for retail being efficient doesn't mean being social so therefore people rarely actually speak to each other outside thier own cliques. 
---
It's ge.mechanics that Foster and support social gaming aspects not.thr players.   Drop this myth now.
---

What if they maxed?
---
There is a specific world channel called Looking for Group. I cannot remember the specific things to click but I believe you right click your general tab on your chat box and click the checkbox next to looking for group.
---
I love the barrens. They are huge and you can spend like 15 levels in there with the odd guest in a nearby zone. The mini jungles around the different water pools and oasis' are beautiful. Plus barrens chat is hilarious.
---
I don't know WoW even 1% as well as I know OSRS but yah I can't think of any crazy goal oriented grinds outside of MC. 
---
Can he do professions? Some things in blacksmithing for example need leather so would he need to lose progress in some to make others and go back and forth? /u/ErnThemCaps
---
Duskwood is great, but it's soooo much running back and forth and back and forth across the zone.
---
How is it more mana efficient? It's *safer* to use lesser heal to top off if your party is messing up or the mechanics don't let you keep people not at full, but in no way is it more *efficient*.
---
Pretty sure you can just hold a button on your keyboard and then click your spell and itl cast on you while still targeting your enemy. Its already built into the game.
---
To be fair though, it's Classic. A modern system doesn't exactly have to work very hard with it in the first place. Being over your refresh rate is a drop in the ocean with Classic.
---
I've made some buddies already which I keep running into in later zones. I make sure to buff them, help them out, chat a bit, etc.
---
I've even met some of the opposite faction that I'll be friendly with. Names I remember. I know they won't attack me, they know I won't attack them, we can help each other out. Feels good.
---
I've also met the opposite. Asshole players who steal your tags or are dicks in the chat. They don't get any help from me. I've watched a few of them get ganked and done nothing. Also feels good.
---
I've not done a lot of Winterspring but I hear lots of hype for it. Typically I don't like snow zones but maybe I'll have to check it out this time around.
---
No tokens on Classic so point is invalid.
---
Im new to wow and picked warrior and got him to lvl 23 without many deaths i felt were attributed to my own poor positioning, relative to the spawns, can anyone tell me what makes them so difficult? I dont feel like the game has been crazy hard, but ive also been with my buddy most of the time who is seasoned and is running a shaman, i felt like he had a harder time than i up until he realized he was missing his totems.
---
dae fish for 10 hours
---
Not sure what is considered a high level at this point or not but I'm only level 30
---
I saw one named bloodyqueef
---
Ive switched toons 3 times already that were in their 20s because of server queues or server imbalance. Fast leveling isn't in the cards for me.
---
Blizzard didn’t pay FiOS their dues this month. 
---
But for real it’ll prolly be straightened out shortly. 
---
I’m having same issues from home but not work.
---
LOL, ur mad at a 60 minute queue while we all wait in 6-8 hour queues.
---
Thanks.  I actually do have a ton of leather that I have a hard time moving on the AH.
---
Also confirming that a VPN works.
---
They constantly add dumb stuff to the game to capture the attention of the horde of 9 year olds who play it. This season they added a giant mech suit which instantly gives someone a huge advantage over the rest of the lobby. I'm sure there's a lot of other stuff, but that's what stuck out to me.
---
I met the coolest guy last night and I'm pretty sure we are going to be friends for a longggggg timeeeee just based on the ease of our banter and how willing we were to help one another.  Never had an experience like this, well not since Vanilla at least.
---
What are striders good at?
---
I have managed to tame the clutchmother.
---
Judging by your reddit tag your on horde. I can only speak for alliance but while questing there wasn't much of a wall in terms of ability to kill mobs. Was always the same frostbolt / nova / polymorph / blink. So your right not everyone is the same. I guess you were more so tired of questing and called it a wall.
---
I quested with a lock for like 3 hours in Westfall, but they had to get off. The next day, I was rolling around the mean streets of Redridge mountains and ran into the lock again. Pretty neat.
---
Don't think people are preaching "Don't rush or powerlevel to 60." I think people are giving advice to new players who are worried about whether or not they need to rush to endgame. Veterans are very well aware that if you are new. You needn't worry about anything other than just play the game, and enjoy your journey.
---
No1 is actively denying players wanting to reach the end game quickly.
---
I am as good as I want to be.
---
Thanks.
---
 At least they aren’t burning down world trees yet.
---
I wonder if Name Change functionality even exists in Classic as of now.
---
if you proc a root the entire pack of mobs is desyncd and will not land nicely into your blizzard slow, never take frostbite for AoE
---
Cool. Really looking forward to you playing this for a few hours and then immediately abandoning this.
---
Melee spirit really should just be warrior spirit. Their health regen scales at a uniquely high coefficient. Spirit * 0.8 + k regen per tick IIRC; other classes are something like Spirit * 0.2 + k, where k is some small flat value I’ve forgotten. I suppose the idea was that other classes get mana regen with their spirit, and rogues have a natural energy regen regardless of spirit, so let’s throw warriors a bone and give them great health regen.
---
It’s better to just have the open bag space than keeping a spirit set though. Downtime is not a big deal with good dungeon gear since you can kill so quickly; I’m regenning to near full by the time I’ve skinned and looted.
---
There is an exciting experiment going by some Troll warrior, “whale warrior” is the idea, where the troll racial regen benefits from stacked spirit. It actually looked pretty interesting once you search out the high spirit plate gear; if you grab some mail and cloth pieces it might actually work.
---
Hate it

I was doing a Stockades run earlier today and Twister Chanter's Staff dropped on which I won the roll:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=890/twisted-chanters-staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=890/twisted-chanters-staff) 
---
After winning the roll I checked to see how rare the drop is I saw that its BiS for lvl 19 twinks (Mages, Hunters and Druids). I've never twinked and don't plan on doing so. So I got 3 options:
---
\- Sell on AH for about 5g, or at least that's where it's listed for atm
---
\- Slap it on. I'm a lvl 27 mage using  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2950/icicle-rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2950/icicle-rod) , pretty decent as well. 
---
\- Keep and wait for price to rise when twinking becomes a thing.
---
What do you guys think is best?
---
PineSol, MrClean, Ajax, Windex  
---
we could make a guild out of this
---
I USED ZA HANDO TO WIPE MY WHOLE LAYER JOSUKE PLEASE RESTORE THEM WITH YOUR CREISHI DAIAMONDO
---
Seems kind of tone deaf on blizzards part to ban innapropriate names in a game thats age demographic is likely like 20s-late 30s.
---
I feel like the political stances of people on Classic are far more diverse than retail trade chat, though. Had a discussion with some dude about Andrew Yang's policy platform's weaknesses in regard to welfare programs while killing goretusks in Redridge.
---
Its crazy how fast some people are levelling, i've made a bunch of characters but my main is level 12 and i'm honestly having an absolute blast. Playing a couple of hours a day around other commitments, and enjoying everything i'm doing on the game.
---
I'm having organic parties being formed mid quest with those around me and i havent even started doing dungeons yet which i know will be an absolute blast. Its such an authentic recreation of the game that i loved over 10 years ago which is just amazing to play. 
---
I'll help someone out, form a quick friendship and log out, to log back in the following day and see they've levelled way past my level range. I'm happy to keep doing my thing though, because there are so many more people to party up with on the journey to 60 :)
---
I hope it gets better, keep having fun, regardless.
---
It just helps manage them. Don't get Necrosis though, it's bloated with a lot of useless stuff now. Use something like Soul Sort, it simply helps manage your shards in your inventory and auto-deleting them once you hit a max amount you set.  
---
Also, while leveling you almost never need that many. I'm in the 40s on a lock and never have more than 5-6 at a time and haven't had any issues so far since everything gives xp and they are easy to get back.
---
Sell this to a tank for some fat money
---
Hey I’m not arguing. BC is basically classic with a 70 cap it was excellent. I just feel like that happening will completely cancel the possibilities of classic + and then eventually classic will start to die down. In a perfect world classic + would start with BC as the base game lol. That would be amazingggg
---
I deleted my level 33 human warrior to reroll gnome for the racial. Guild said I was crazy but we're only in week 2 we have plenty of time!
---
A lot of it is just people freaking out but there are some level headed folk in there trying to figure it all out. However even some of those level headed people are starting to feel the doom a bit. It’s hard to play when one of your only defensive 
---
Strategies doesn’t work at all ya know.
---
Basically yeah. and that's what I understand them to be but I'm no expert
---
I'm 3 days played, but that's mainly from remote desktop while work to skip que when I hit home so I can actually play the 1-2 hours, gonna take awhile to hit 60, but it's super fun regardless!
---
On my server queues reach 1k at the peak hour (less than 10 minutes waiting), for the rest of the day there's none. You've picked an overcrowded realm is all.
---
Me not that kinda orc
---
Sorry, I apologize for not being clear.  I didn't mean you - I was just referencing the general population.  I've seen so many "what should retail do because of classic" threads and the like.  
---
At this point they are two different games - right, wrong, or indifferent.  Enjoy what you enjoy and let the other be.
---
Great idea. I'm going to do the same thing, but better kits, charge for them and stand in the crossroads.
---
I'm always alliance so I always miss this zone :( maybe I can make a horde character just for that
---
I wonder how long I'll keep Chodefungus
---
That WAS due in large part to how goddamned terrible the playerbase was at that point in time, though. Have you really looked at the boss mechanics in Naxx? LFG bosses in retail have as many mechanics as they do. I suspect the playerbase will be surprised at how quickly they chew through Classic's content, even without being lunatics like &lt;APES&gt;.

Anyone who said vanilla was harder is full of shit.
---
from about lvl 25 on it gets A LOT easier, especially with a good mainhand
---
Hinterlands/arathi high lands....but to be honest Feralas is my absolute fav! Idk what it is about the dense forest and just the whole layout and vibe of the place makes it seem even more wild than ungoro
---
You might want to include your server and faction
---
How is this not acting like an asshole?
---
The other high-level warr in my guild, who's always grouped with a priest and mage and who got a Whirlwind axe and I had to skip it, asked me why I was having such a hard time leveling my warrior
---
Fucking lol
---
The one in hillsbrad is elite , the barrens one is not.
---
Absolutely best zone pre cataclysm.
---
My way around this is if I have to do a bunch of quests in Ravenhill I fly to west fall and run from there. Don’t know if it’s actually shorter.. but it seems like it lol. Then I just try to get them all completed before turn in.
---
I do agree though, a lot of running, but at least the atmosphere is cool? Lol.

Nobody cares about your opinion on addons. Let people use what they want. It's their experience, not yours. You do not have to install addons you dont like.

2% of riding is not even in the same realm of a firstborn. I'm not saying it's insignificant, I'm saying your exaggeration is silly. :P

This is literally a second in a lifetime opportunity.

By playing the game
---
So do we all get to roll on any herbs or mining nodes that other gathering professions get during dungeons? Most people would say no. They could have taken the profession but didn't, so why should they get the same rights to it as the person who put in the time and effort to level it? How about the core leather from Molten Core? Do you think everyone in a pug run should also have equal rights to that too? It's the exact same situation. Same thing for Scale of Onyxia, except for that the skinner also has to go to the trouble of having gloves enchanted for skinning *and* carry around Finkle's Skinner to do it.
---
You're making the argument that every group member should get to roll on anything that someone with a gathering profession gathers while in a dungeon, which would be bullshit.
---
I started on Saturday and my rogue is now lvl 12 😤
---
I got to 41. Slowed down a little bit because I'm leveling with 2 others and we decided to sleep. I think if I went mage I would be pushing 60 right now.
---
Pokemon GO is still really popular. You don't do $800,000,000 in revenue without being popular.
---
So this is why I still have to wait 1+ hour in que to get on my server
---
I feel like an irresponsible 25 year old again, except I’m 39.  
---
Seriously, haven’t had this much fun playing WoW in a loooooooooong time.
---
Brought a new friend to retail, he named his Paladin "Kneegrowjoe" I told him he'd be reported and have to name change before level 20. We bet on it. He's level 80. Still Kneegrowjoe.
---
They share GCD. That is why it is skipping. If you do a sequence, it will skip sting and go to the next in the sequence if one of them is on GCD.
---
Being a great tank is basically 4 things:  know how to generate single target threat, know how to generate AOE threat, know when your party needs CC, and know when to not pull because of pats or healer mana.
---
Its interesting because I have been criticized by returning players for starting on vanilla wow. I have heard from multiple people in game that vanilla was only for players that played when the original game was out! I know they are wrong but it just surprised me. However, I am very happy with the game so far and probably have put in a little tooo much time in to it. :D
---
Shift is not a problem, but CTRL can be a bit of an issue. But you can always remap CTRL to something easier to reach. Once you train your brain you do it without even thinking. The only issue then is playing on someone else's account that doesn't have my control scheme setup and trying to figure out why I can't play. LOL
---
Then get one of those Police Detectives to draw what it looks like.
---
Especially a nelf male. This guy has nerves of steel.
---
that doesn't even make sense .... 
---
you are saying because they TOLD me (... not "forced me lulw btw"....)  to move out of a server where literally 30 of my friends are, I should just bend over and take my ass to a medium pop server ?  
---
so now we went from " you think you do but you don't want classic servers " to " let's create 5 servers on naming day and add 25 extra after launch " to " please move out of those servers where you got your names and your friends are to dumbfck named servers where no one will be there in 3 months " ...
---
sad fuking shills will say anything to defend this company lol
---
Saw 'Punchmytits' running around Durotar yesterday, I don't think he'll get far sadly.
---
Lol aw
---
Google in the search bar:
---
    Site:Reddit.com wow classic music list
---
You can then use tools to limit it to 3 months.
---
I went for the first time yesterday. I had autorun on while on the path so I could order lunch. Not two steps across the border into hillsbrad I get rolled by three alliance.
---
Jokes on them the hillsbrad graveyard is across the zone at tarran mill so I just graveyard rezzed.
---
The wipe at the end was pretty hilarious actually. I mainly wanted to do the deadmines so I could complete that quest and take the leaders head back to sentinel hill. We took down the leader, but he summoned minions right before he died and they finished us off. With my last sliver of health, I took the guys head, jumped off the boat, and died from the fall damage lol.
---
+1 for player controlled vws
---
oh shit you found out I hacked into your pc
---
I mean i played Vanilla from day one pretty hardcore. Only ever had a few people that were KOS or avoided for groups, few enough with acts egregious enough that memory and word of mouth was enough. Ive always felt like people keeping black lists for slights in a lvl 20 dungeon have already lost more than the blacklisted person, and layering makes it even less worth.
---
Are you Hørdi on Shazzrah?
---
Fairbanks, and I'll have to change it lol
---
Was your professor a professor of gaming?
---
Jokes aside, pushing as many frames to your monitor is still beneficial for putting as much information as fast as possible.
---
Think of it this way, you have a 60Hz monitor.  Push 60fps and you get 1 frame every second.  Push 120 and you get 120 half frames shown every second.  Push 240 and you get 240 quarter frames every second.
---
The downside is this creates screen tearing on images that have lots of movement.  But the more and more you overdrive frames to your monitor, the smaller and smaller those gaps in screen tear are.
---
Funny thing is since there were lest mobile phones in 2004 especially with the ability to take pictures. Somehow we are worse off with this new age of players who dont know what print screen is.
---
Once I got Chrome Remote Desktop on my phone everything got better :D
---
So the difference here is the rogue signed up as a dps for the group, the healer signed up as a group healer. If you don't do the job you joined the group as you are 100% in the wrong. The rogue was not invited as a lock picker more than likely. Now if you advertise in chat "LF1 rogue to open lock boxes during our run" then he joined the group to do that and should.
---
Main job =/= niche class mechanic... please get a better comparison
---
I'm having an amazing time. I've played on a pve server since late TBC till BFA, and decided to get the legit classic experience and roll on a pvp realm. I'm level 32 now and from now till I retire I have to keep my head on a swivel, and the fear and excitement are making it that much more enjoyable.
---
15 years later I am married with 3 children, level 26 here.
---
This may be the biggest plot hole in WoW lore to exist! You’re a genius!
---
Journeyman should train you past 75, anyway there's another trainer (expert) in a building just round the corner where the main trainers are in the mage quarter, go to him and see if you can advance, name is Georgio Bolero.
---
yea but never had trouble finding groups
---
No, I’ve played since day one. I’ve seen shit go downhill since Activision started this shit.
---
I was there when pong came out and I’ve been a gamer since- seen everything and I know your type. 
---
Mad?  No reason to be.  Old enough to say your being a dumbass because you are?  Fuck yeah I am.
---
Because agi on plate is gross, almost as gross as you are as a human being :D
---
You could for a period of time during beta but it got patched
---
Vendoring them, is that wrong?
---
Cool, I'm off at 3:30 today as well. Good luck playing tonight!
---
Shots fired! This seems spot on...
---
Mobs will attack the target with the highest aggro, provided they can reach the target. If they can not reach the highest aggro target, they will attack the highest aggro target within range.
---
If the tank has aggro on a mob but you freeze it in place within melee range of a party member, if the mob can not hit the tank, it will hit the party member until the freeze ends. At that point, it will stop attacking the party member and return to hitting the tank (as long as the tank is still at the top of the aggro list).
---
to be fair, Barrens chat is and has always been the dregs of social commentary in wow. I have fond memories of all the chuck norris jokes while trying to get a group for wailing caverns.
---
DoTs critting was added in one of the later expansions. I think you'll want +shadow power to increase DoT damage.
---
But I mean...who DOESN’t sniff their own farts? JUSSAYIN.
---
I'm saying make smarter decisions in life. Your friends are stupid as well.
---
There is a guy who wants to play with my brothers and friends from our hometown. We played vanilla together. The problem is that he is a convicted sex offender. Got caught in an undercover to catch a predator type sting. A couple of us (not me) have daughters. He will not be joining us.
---
What’s happening? The hurricane?
---
Blizz really botched this.  What a mess.   Affect the integrity of the game to avoid queues with layering and then still have massive queues....
---
haha i thought so, any clue whats goin on?
---
Don't come back, if you didn't think about picking it up on your own, you may not enjoy it .
---
Why don’t you just phoque off with that
---
I'm still down here in Maryland :(
---
Many great warriors died to boars, there's no shame in it. Great warrior like King Bobby B
---
One in a million to match 3 in a row from the start. If you're just considering matching 2 more times after the initial first roll it's 1 in 10,000 :)
---
It would be even much much rarer if you matched on the same number every time or specific numbers in a particular order, but one in a million is already freaking crazy.
---
Why are you leaving?
---
It's going to be more than just a few weeks until phase 2.  
---
Didn't bother watching the video, a timestamp would have been helpful.
---
If you've played destiny or the division it's the same thing but better
---
Thanks Bob Barker.
---
Whats thunderbluff? New raid?
---
I need you to try something for me... I know it will be hard for you but please try... Try very hard to not be a toxic asshole. Can you do that for me? Thanks.
---
No it's actually very detailed in that it measures time of completion vs reward and talks about where to go and what to avoid. It's really worth your time even if you just need pointers when you get stuck

Warriors become ludicrous, unstoppable killing machines once they level up and get some gear
---
You know how in DND there is a meme about linear fighters and quadratic wizards?
---
It's the exact opposite in WoW
---
Warriors get much, much stronger with gear. But there is a catch. They not only get stronger, they also get stronger *because* they are stronger
---
You see, instead of just dealing more damage and getting more crits, warriors also get more rage to do more damage and get more crits, which causes them to do more damage and get bigger crits
---
Do you see?
---
&gt; As warrior pull prepare a Long cast time heal on him once it’s 1s left jump or press ESC to cancel casting if he is not hurt enough
---
I prefer to just move forward/back slightly with W/S keys.  Seems faster / more reliable over a jump.
---
If you are physically capable of waiting for the hype to die a bit before playing, it might be best for your sanity. Some servers are still multi-hour queues and we don’t know of any servers could die out
---
This is how I res people who die in piles of mob corpses who've already released.
---
Try Disabling any ingame overlays such as: Steam, Discord, Geforce Experience, etc. 
---
If that does not work try entering the following in chat window:  /console rawMouseEnable 1
---
you as well!
---
Yeah, and? Do you think that everyone in the group should get to roll on all the ore and herbs that those professions gather while in a dungeon? Most people would find that to be kind of bullshit.
---
Definitely wait for the patron to be available at the vendor in alterac it's well worth :)
---
Oh ok, that makes sense. I might have misread the dudes rank, it might be apprentice.. Where can I find journeyman trainer in SW then?
---
If you got a purty mouth I could help you out
---
IMO you only really need 2, maybe 3 shards on you at any given time when leveling. 
---
When I use a shard on a Demon/Stone, I replace it on the next mob. If I die, I rebuff and murder the next living thing I see for its soul.
---
I wonder if I even need to use my Soul Pouch tbh, is it worth sacrificing 8 slots? I'm not sure.
---
Evens
---
tbh, grinding mobs isn't a whole lot slower than questing, it's just really boring and repetitive.
---
I haven't had a queue time yet because I played a low pop realm.
---
Truly the best game ever
---
Ok sure! I’ll give it a try! Thanks!
---
&gt;a few weeks
---
Then why are you shitposting on day 7?
---
Layering needs to be removed, whether or not it should be delayed is a different argument. They're already blue posting about free0server transfers to aid server congestion. Let them reach a point to where they say they're ready to remove layering before you start getting worried and complaining.
---
Hmm, mines Eatchabootea... I wonder if I’ll be okay lol
---
No queue on Herod?!? Impossible!
---
More then likely they are going off of reports and people are being anal about it,
---
Would you consider "Dude, Where's My Mount" to be nostalgic?
---
What do you mean World Drop?  Is there only one of these on the server or something?  Is a notification sent to the server that the one of these in the world dropped?
---
Wow. Thank you so much. İt is the first result.
---
What is the hardest class to get to level 60?
---
Looks good, will register and try it out when I get off work.
---
Autorunning down the dock at the boat today. Keyboard battery died and I walked straight off
---
Maybe, I dropped threat because I parried 3 times in a row while the rogue when full blast lol
---
Same.
---
And the people rushing as fast as possible to 60 are the "Adderall isn't a drug - asmongold is hilarious - why would I want to read quest logs" kinds of people.
---
See how it's easy to pull cheap shots like that?
---
The graphics were "dated" by 2004 standards. Only they weren't really "dated" so much as "stylized".
---
It's part of why WoW has aged as well as it has. Kind of like Team Fortress 2 - chunky and cartoony by design, not trying to be realistic.
---
&gt; I've never put more then 2 hours into a mmorpg
---
Why? you don't like them?
---
If not, you won't like WoW either since it's an MMORPG too.
---
I wouldn't say that. I just didn't meld well with the first guys and joined a more light-hearted group.
---
Never heard of it described as thrash, "rofl". 
---
So sure, if you consider those bosses, the value of defense is higher. In molten core it really isn't a concern.
---
awesome meme nice
---
I thought they wanted to get hit for rage generation though?
---
the link goes directly to the time.  the plan has always been for layering to be removed before phase 2, the latest Q&amp;A still goes by that.
---
Kromkrush
---
sorry but you consumed all your rolls. hopefully you are radiing dkp
---
On my server is just people looking to start political arguments. Literally spamming “TRUMP 2020” and then followed by actual explicit racist comments. Sad thing is that no one gets baited by replying back but it doesn’t stop the spamming. You wanna express support for a political candidate and have a legit conversation about policy, go for it! But please stop it with the explicit racism, it’s so sad to see them try so hard to get attention.
---
Oh yeah it definitely does put it in 1 spot on the screen.
---
LoL, I had "Sugartits" up to lvl 20 before a mod noticed and made me change it.  It was right after the Mel Gibson incident.
---
They just went in to down what they could on monday night before reset. Everything you're inferring is just your own narrative lol
---
He is an idiot...
---
You are the one being an asshole if you ninja warrior tank prebis as a paladin, buddy.
---
You’re like those idiots that complain about being stuck in traffic when they themselves are traffic. 
---
It wasn’t blizzards incompetence that caused you not to play, that was your incompetence.
---
They block Drive at work but they should all be here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tLJoR\_4WTvCYJgDtQchcMx0PO2iaVUY7](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tLJoR_4WTvCYJgDtQchcMx0PO2iaVUY7)
---
You could transfer servers for money in vanilla. There was like a 6 month cooldown on it or something.
---
well... i guess there i only one way to find out. thanks for the comment
---
With a name like that you'd think it'd be mostly night elves
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Mage_area_of_effect_locations
---
That's a good place to look for all the areas that you can aoe grind at while leveling. Some of them are better because jokerd made the best spots mega overpopulated. Most of the time choosing a spot that isn't meta ends up being better in my experience. Avoid the areas with ranged though.
---
This feels so good! Everyone will be happy, even if people don’t want to move their queue will go down. Can’t wait to hear more about it!
---
Not exactly. The hope was to relive WoW vanilla but to do so with close friends; about 8 of us in total are playing. We all played Vanilla but not with friends back in the day. I rolled warrior hoping to duo quest my way to 60, and to do all the 5 man dungeons along the way with a party of friends.
---
Terrible queues, and conflicting work and girlfriend schedules have resulted in us all being on at different times and being different levels. There's been little questing together, and almost no dungeons done together.
---
then they would have used the word plan, not promise
---
This is normal, most places it blends well with the background but some places not so much, also night and day and weather effects can make this stick out more or less depending.
---
You have a pet to tank for you bud
---
The real question is what levels you get upgrades to those actually useful skills.
---
How long can I heal instances as full shadow? I was doing discipline as sort of a split to help when we quested and did dungeons. I can keep healing if I start going shadow?
---
Oh look it's this thread again!
---
Saw some guy in wetlands, dude's name was Throatloader. My sides were in orbit
---
Night elf is obviously the best race for warriors
---
Always horde tried Alliance.
---
I miss my crude horde fam, the Alliance seem so...friendly, it's a bit off putting.
---
Boomer response
---
Runs fine on an old 2012 pro retina, you’ll be fine.
---
Sulfuras has been good to me and my friend group! Most I've waited in queue is  1 hr as well.
---
Stab some of their targets once they tag them, then throw an invite.   
---
I get instant invites when I drop their mobs in 1-2 secs.
---
Before his baldness loses a finger, he used to be a good boy.
---
I'm afraid that's the only good source--it comes straight from the vanilla dev team. the book is not freely available online I'm afraid
---
Yeah, cuz it's retail and he hasn't seen another soul to report him yet.
---
You can pick up actual herbs in bear form but not the serpentbloom which sucks
---
Yeah I went straight to lutris to avoid messing with wine and it works like a charm.
---
3 days in, level 14. Prob spent about an hour-2 hawking bags to level my tailoring in town/new areas.
---
But jeez, walking from area to area just eats so much time.
---
First aid
---
Why bother running onyxia as a miner if there isnt some super rare node for me to mine?
---
You're still there to get loot, and skinners, if I remember correctly can make decent money selling rugged leather, no?
---
Ive been vendering. Keeps me off of the AH alt.
---
And note that this works for any channel. You can create your own channel by typing /join whatever.
---
You have to tame a pet that knows claw rank 3 and have that pet use the ability so you can learn it and teach it to other pets
---
Look at Blizzard doing all the things we want them to do lately.
---
Cheers to you all!
---
As long level up and fight/tame stronger beasts they will have higher ranks of the abilities. Taming then and using them a bit until you learn the abilities will permanently let them be trainable to all future pets that are appropriate level/family. 
---
Using beast lore will display what skill they can teach if any.  Also there’s wow Petopia that will listen all the different beasts for every skill level and where to find them.
---
Also you don’t need to learn/teach every level of the skill. So if you have bite 1 you don’t need to find/teach Bite 2. You can go straight to higher levels.
---
and you said the layers would be gone within a couple weeks
---
Honestly though maybe I am just early in the game but the story is pretty much.  "X is in this area, kill them please" or "bring me x amount of this just because".  
---
I haven't seen anything regarding the current state or what's going on in the world yet.  But like I said I'm early in the game.
---
Hell no, I want my Whirlwind axe and I'm going to get it you plebian
---
Fights 15sec or less, serpent is better. But long fights scorpid takes the lead.
---
"Any warrior who takes deathbone away from a paladin needs to get a good solid dropkick to the balls."
---
"Try not being a toxic asshole"
---
Its 2019 and deathbone is for tank warriors.  Bye.
---
Yeah, enjoy the ride. We’ve all been waiting years for classic and I find it quite sad that people are racing to the finish line in the first week just to get momentary applause from anonymous people online.
---
That’s definitely it. I got reported for a name change the other day, but no ban time. Fortunately it let me change it to the exact same name, so I’m sticking with the name and just laying low for a while. No more shitposting in general chat for Harderdaddy, the tank who really enjoys his job 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Sell it
---
First aid or AH
---
embrace the void
---
Wait til its battlegrounds and queueing up against server horde.  Seeing Guildnames that you know, like, oh its &lt;PVP guild&gt; or &lt;Hardcore Raiding guild&gt;, you knew you were in for a good fight.
---
I can't wait for BG's lol.
---
I already made an in-game suggestion for this a couple days ago. Everyone do the same!
---
I like Hunters. I can blame them for my mistakes. I even blame them without a Hunter in the group. I don't feel any guilt.. because I am the Rogue.
---
Did I pull? Nah, I was in stealth, must have been the other guys.
---
I didn't kick? Sorry, had no energy (to use kick right after my Sinister Strike).
---
Thanks for buffing me. Of course I can open that lock.. for money.
---
That's kinda how it was back then, but less focused. It was always loud, rapid, and chaotic. Now its thrown in political though, which ages like fine milk
---
Notice I said while leveling, what's viable late game doesn't matter while you're leveling up.
---
If a group needs a tank and a shaman is available that wants to do it, let them do it, same thing with a Druid or a Paladin. Who the fuck cares if Warriors are the only ones that can tank Naxx when we're trying to do Wailing Caverns or Scarlet Library? People don't need to let their game roles in 40 man raid environments dictate what they can and can't do while leveling up or in 5 man low level content.
---
Maybe. The general consensus is 'if it could pass as an actual name, even if it's a pun, it's good'. If I saw that I'd be fine with it
---
The boomers quip, mixed with that quiet air of desperation that can only be cured by Internet random agreeing with you, ah, smells like high school to me.
---
Taskmaster has +8 to stam and spirit.  Honestly more viable for a hunter than a warrior, but both could use it.  If it was actually str/stam then a reasonable hunter would wait to see how the warrior roles before even trying to need against it.
---
You'll encounter dumb loot roles up to mid 20s or so while people are just trying to fill empty slots.  My advice is to join a guild and play with the same people once you find a good group.  People are much less likely to be dicks or roll against you "unfairly" if they are in your guild.
---
No. You can login to as many accounts as you want. 
---
Bop= bind on pickup from boss drops. 
---
You didn’t used to control two account, but now I suppose you could.
---
You just cleared everything on ver levelled main and then before boss, swapped to alt and caught up.
---
You didn’t want exp on alt or it might overlevel, so this wasn’t an issue.
---
Does this look like someone performing a frame perfect glitch 40 minutes into a run that either ends the run or gives them a chance at the world record? No. It's a dude hitting his head against his spacebar.
---
First of all it's Bieber not Beiber, don't disrespect JB like that. Second of all that analogy is hot garbage because JB works for himself and his record label.
---
Are you really going to argue Asmongold being one of the most famous twitch streamers doesn't advertise the game to a larger audience? I don't get what you're trying to argue here
---
I see 2 warriors for every other class though
---
I know exactly the area you're talking about. i'm an alliance mage myself. we are very squishy. we are basically glass cannons. Even the ones that are slightly lower than us can hit hard. especially things like the whelps that do magic damage. if you're being hit by magic users i recommend dampen magic. do NOT buff yourself with amplify magic if you're facing magic users because that will just wreck your face. otherwise, make sure you peel them off and only attack one at a time. also don't solo elites.
---
Have fun in the queue.
---
Arcane Blast --&gt; Arcane Jazzhands
---
Depending on AH prices on your server, auction it, make bags and auction those, or just level first aid.
---
I dont have BFA installed so I dont even have this issue =P
---
Casting my rank 4 yes :D
---
This isn’t what makes guilds toxic.  However, going slow every pull IS what leads to these two hour Deadmines runs or Stocks that take more than 30 minutes I hear about.
---
Again, in raids you have to be more careful because DPS pulling on even one mob is a death-risk.  It’s not in these five mans.
---
Keep in mind that Classic doesn't have a threat API, so the only way a threat addon can work is if everyone in the group is using one so it can share combat log data.
---
They actually just announced free transfers off packed realms in a blue post today.
---
I woulda transfers thursday if they woulda let me. Fuck these queues
---
Wouldn't this require a carry through almost all of SM to complete at lvl 34? I would think that takes longer than the whirlwind quest, right?
---
tbf you can't caps letters other then the first,
---
I also loled... as i reported
---
Check prices but I'd guess yeah most likely.  Heavy on my server is like 15% more on the ah than vendor but I'm still vendoring
---
Lol, you are right. I might infinitely better.
---
I swear this could have been the horde players in StoneTalon too
---
Ooooooh! I forgot about them, they drop quests don't they?
---
That's it, I'm up to level 20 and food is pretty scarce. Saving for a mount makes the purchase a royal pain in the ass. So from all the warriors, thank you sir. You are what makes the game beautiful.
---
awesome thank you!
---
I got to 32. If people were complaining below 25, I don’t understand it, but any past that and it started to feel like you were wasting your time on a character you might never get to access on normal days after work. Felt bad. I’m excited about moving to a server with smaller queues!
---
Easiest class/spec to raid on. Looks like there was a wipe earlier due to body on ground. 40 man raid this early on meaning hardcore raiding guild so healers, tanks and dps who actually have a real role/threat are trained and can do this fight in their sleep. Delete post - this has nothing to do with the average player.
---
Cries in Gehennas.
---
Ragefire Chasm. You're adorable and I like you.
---
it's been real sad to see all the "lfm for chain X" people actually chain the same dungeons again and again to reach the easiest endgame ever instead of making friends...
---
Its easy, you go to petopia for example and look what pet has claw rank whatever. Then you go out and tame that bad boy. After that you gight 2 or 3 mobs with the newly tamed pet and then you learn it automaticly. After that you release the tamed pet and get your original pet and teach it
---
It's been so long since I actually laughed out loud ... Thank you !!
---
I've always assumed DM meant they had a quest and didn't intend to clear the dungeon, whereas VC meant a full clear (as in defeating Van Cleef).
---
Oh you know, everything 😂
---
Read. There’s a story there. They always have a reason for kill x.
---
O, and nice edit.
---
I thought you couldn't jump with levitate on, so you can't actually get any higher?
---
You're never going to convince these people.
---
So i havent joined classic yet, how do they have it a separate tab on the server select screen?
---
Thank you!!
---
2018, ahh ok sounds good ty
---
Ok you casual
---
Two things: 
---
* Classic defaults to, well, classic settings (Level 3 of 10). Make sure to crank that slider, if you want visual fidelity. 
---
* I'm pretty sure your approach would be a ban able offense, since you would technically be able to gain unfair advantages, by using different models (for example full opacity stealth models etc.)
---
Have you tried putting those as the keybinds for special action buttons? Those are your stance keybinds.
---
Plenty of new players can’t keep their interest in the boring easy leveling and quit because the game is too easy. But I have a feeling that for at least a portion of them if they participated in mythic + and raiding they would find that sense of community and challenge.
---
Everyone from shazz is coming to ur server, i heard.
---
This is me :). I learned a long time ago just to enjoy my time playing. And after all, it's classic, so there's nowhere to go after 60...
---
/targetenemy
---
/startattack
---
I'm definitely not saying he didnt deserve it. He joined discord, told us what happened, and we laughed at him because he knew it was coming.
---
Doesn’t need to, the character is called Bankelf.
---
Seriously? I was running by a rogue last night around 25-28 named dildobagginz.
---
You can also take the boat to Theramore and jump off before the loading screen to get close to the drown spot a lot faster.
---
Nope
---
Oof. Nah that's over I think
---
What about newer players who haven't had 1-2 years to hit 60 by then? You're essentially saying they don't deserve a vote, which is silly. Maintaining a steady influx of new players is extremely important to an MMO's longevity. Silencing the voice of newer players (who are able to offer unique insight into the new-player experience) would be a mistake, were polling introduced.
---
He set his hearth to SW near the end of the vid :)
---
I think its funnier when you go into a keep or something that is all quiet because someone just cleared, but you walk on top of skeletons because so many people have died and rezzed, only to have respawns spawn on top of you and then you add your skeleton to the pile. lol.
---
Warriors are gear reliant. Which just means they need all the stats they can get. Which means you should level every profession which can provide you extra stats ON TOP of gear.
---
- Cooking/Fishing for food with buffs
---
- Alchemy/Herbing, again free stats
---
You might be able to make a piece of gear with blacksmithing or something similar, but you'll replace that eventually. Buffs stack on top of everything so you can always take it with you. 
---
+stam &amp; +spirit food together with +str/+agi elixirs is huge during early levels. Once you can do dungeons reliably do whatever, but honestly I don't see how you can go wrong with Alchemy as a warrior.
---
Idk why but that's funny man.  😂
---
when i first started playing wow in '05 or whenever, realms were not nearly as populated as they have been so far in classic - it's left a different experience in it's wake.
---
It's rough till you get the axe at 30 I MUST REPEAT WARRIORS ARE SO HARD TILL U GET THE AXE U MUST GET AXE
---
hey u have some great time too for a warrior!
---
Now you can stop complaining and choose another one.
---
the moves are from high to low pop realms, guy
---
I want to play a fire mage (currently frost) but heard that enemies will be fire resistant later in the game. Will I have to respec later if I don't plan on raiding in this game?
---
Don’t they keep the same name when re-summoned though?
---
Even without MCP, bear greatly outperforms fury for threat. And fury is not "a lot more tanky".
---
Int, Int and more int - Spirit helps if you have something that allows for mana regen while casting which I dont think Pallies have. You can also downrank some of your heals to make up for lower mp.
---
see the thing is tho ou have those stubborns who wont move even tho theyre only what level 5?
---
I freaking love this rule.
---
I remember leveling a prot warrior in MoP and it was insane. Shield Slam and Revenge both did an insane amount of damage. You could pull mobs and basically just mow through them and you’d never die because of victory rush. In BGs you were an unstoppable killing machine, you only really needed to use like 4 abilities, it was fucking nuts
---
I want in
---
They will be begging for a transfer to a high pop realm within a year...
---
Is that the Pridelord himself? Oh wow I remember camping out in a tree all day waiting for him to spawn back in the day. I was also Alliance so sneaking into the Barrens to do it was a bit of a a thrill. Good times! 👍
---
It's still the first week man, the ques will be gone soon (next 1-2 weeks). The problem then becomes, once layering is done with during the start of Phase 2, the ques will be back, and when that happens you will be glad you transferred.
---
Warlock isn't hunter though.
---
I'm a little confused by this talent (again), as the above states that you should always-be-casting and only popping the heal when needed to maintain the 5-sec rule.  So my question is how does this talent work/add to the 5-sec rule?
---
A bit of both
---
yes you will get more efficient with levels and gear
---
yes you will need to drink more often than you like.
---
+ use more Wand Damage
---
Its funny because OP is the douche in this scenario and he thinks we would agree with him. Lol.
---
Play fucking retail
---
It's pure nerd gold!
---
Layering is in the game. If you get layered it's part of the game. No issues. It is a necessary evil.
---
**BUT** if you spam chat asking to force a layer so you can abuse spawns of mobs, nodes, quest items etc that is gaming the system and 100% not the intention of layering. It just flat isnt. Layering is meant to address the mass amounts of population we would have crammed  into these zones. It's not a system to give you faster XP/min, gank avoidance, extra resource nodes etc. And you already admitted to abusing layering so you have totally done this. How is this logic not hard to understand? It's completely different than your comparison to flying mounts in TBC.
---
No wtf, basically ret paladins only use auto attack and few abilities but auras are just a buff, you'll have to cast your heals and all that.
---
I guess it depends on your level range, but by ~40 or so you should have a decent amount of +healing items for healing dungeons. So not incorrect. If you're talking about healing WC then fine, but you don't have a ton of ranks at that level anyways.
---
Not to mention that the max rank often overheals more fragile group members.
---
Not sure I understand what you mean?
---
You very easily could have collectively as a group been like "guys let's go roll on another one of the new servers (Krommcrush and Kirtonos opened day 1) to avoid queues before anyone invested too much time into a character."
---
I don't get what's so hard about that.
---
Ahhh just hit 19!!! Can’t wait for cheetah! I been taking it slow and just duo leveling with a good friend...when he’s not on I work on profs and what not to stay the same level and to stay on the same quests! I only got that last month of classic before TBC came out and I rushed to max level (as fast as my skill allowed at least...never goto higher than 30 before tbc) so it went quick but also I didn’t know enough or use guides or addons back than and it was such an adventure...now I’m taking my time because I know everything, with addons and all that... so my time leveling is waaaay more efficient but I’m still taking time to smell the flowers
---
First aid, auction house, or give it to a tailor alt or guildies.
---
He set his hearth to sw at the end
---
They're peppered around the levels, but one rule of thumb is that on even 10's you'll usually get something really good.
---
You might want to check your main damage dealing abilities while you're at the trainer when you get them next.
---
Nope.  Nobody, not a single one.  Except for pretty much everyone in the east coast with fios.
---
Same the outage map says a lot of areas on the east coast are having problems
---
Where did you see that 2m were playing Classic? I tried looking around a bit but couldn't find any figures.
---
Chose the realm suggested by blizzard to avoid queue times and then got stuck in unplayable queues.
---
If you don't think that's on them then you are retarded
---
giving away free bags initially at a server launch fucks the economy.
---
it's not about you being able to make money or not. if that all the other people that are forced to sell stuff in order to make space and their current bagd no longer need to. because they have a freely available option to obtain bags instead of a need to make money to buy them.
---
it won't have crazy long-term effects, but it definitely makes it as so that people have some initial beneficial effects.
---
even selling them at cost is better than free
---
First tier by 20
---
Honestly a game like wow I think a few hours a day is probably pretty close to average.
---
gl on the grind from 38-40 itll fly by :)
---
Thinking there will only be one lock in a raid lmfao
---
nothing that involves people is immune to people. never was. plenty of hate in vanilla chats as well. the only reason bfa isn't full of hateful chat messages is because there are barely any to begin with. 
---
not much we can do about it. I doubt blizz has teh resources to check all the reports.
---
Went to the gym came back and it’s still down, tweeted at them 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Haha my brother I were riding through there last night polymorphing people and dancing with them. If there was a group 5 murdering you all that would explain everyone running for their lives...
---
True that lol
---
Everyone? Thats quite a lot of people. Like, at least 12, probably more.
---
There were lfg addons in vanilla....
---
Great. My guild name is called tiddycity
---
When classic launched I was at work, just had some time to play at night. 
---
Next day was the same. 
---
Third day I couldn’t play at all so I was falling behind right from the start. 
---
Every time I logged on I checked the guild roster to see how everyone was doing and I felt the pressure. 
---
Then I started to think, fuck it, I’m going to enjoy this game and just level at my own pace, I get to 60 when I do.
---
But if I'm spamming the key won't it stop my Frostbolt as soon as I start casting?
---
Here is an example HandyNotes.lua you can use this as a baseline for yours.  It looks like you're missing some variables that the stock file should have created for you.
---
https://pastebin.com/Mt5hJV4A
---
Replace all %CHARNAME% with your character name
---
Replace all %SERVER% with the server your character is on
---
If I may add a few tips. 
---
@60 the amount of people who need your services for instances and events is high. Offer to do them a tanking service at the cost of any boe or blues that drop go to you if it’s not needed.
---
Try to fight 1 level below your current level 
---
Don’t get caught up in revenge pvp. 
---
People may walk over you in pvp early on. That’s okay. 
---
Always look for a priest or healer who will duo with you. Your potential for massive pulls is great for leveling.
---
When I first played WoW in 2005 my character name was Creamypoo. Lasted to a solid level 33 until I was forced to change it.
---
ShareX is the master race of screen shotting software
---
There aren't really official anything for servers except for the server forums on the official WoW site.
---
Real Chads select trolls for their regeneration racial
---
Unfortunately, you kind of have to look at it as part of the game for now, because it’s literally useable by everyone if they choose to hop layers and all it takes is to ask for a party invite.
---
Iirc deadmines doesn't have any great wand boosts. You likely want to get lesser magic wand, then either greater magic wand or the WC quest reward/rare drop wand; then finally gravestone scepter from BFD (DO NOT SKIP THIS ITEM). I used that till 41, when I could pick up the white vendor wand in any capital city. From there, you wanna get the noxxious shooter in mara, and then the wand from ST, and then the level 60 blue quest wand and now you're at raid gear wands.
---
That's it, that's probably all of the wands you will use the entire time leveling.
---
At lvl 58 with greens!
---
For every person rushing to 60 because they legitimately enjoy it, there are probably 10 people rushing because they feel pressured and would actually have more fun going slow.
---
Cheers mate, I'll keep this in mind I reckon I just need to get used to playing this way
---
Racing is pointless there is no end game stuff. No pvp. The raids can be easily beaten you just hit 60 then sit there with nothing and wait for weekly resets on raids clear in 5 hours and then log off for a week. It's literally just like BFA end game lol
---
Hit level 21 on my rogue and 14 on my hunter, having a blast rotating between the two! Got cruel barb from the Deadmines and ran it again and got the Cape of the brotherhood! So happy! :D 
---
I feel like the best way to play classic is to take it slow and enjoy the experience.
---
Where can I find this one
---
This is the safest way to approach dungeons, more applicable in 50+ dungeons, but shouldn't be a guideline for every one.
---
Your dungeon runs are going to take forever if you wait for threat on every mob. The content is easy, the only way Ive ever encountered a wipe is from aggroing to many mobs by patrols, mobs running, or bad pulls.
---
Id say its somewhere between 0.1% and 10%
---
I found a way to get on despite the queues
---
I am resourceful ;)
---
I know about 4 people with level 25-35 character that are stuck on high queue servers. That’s a lot of hours that can be mitigated and help server health on two servers. It’s a complete win for blizzard to do this. I played all last week on Herod without a single queue because I worked evenings. Am I a piece of shit for wanting to transfer my level 30 now that I’m back on days and can’t get on in the evening?
---
&gt; I never bothered to farm for 280% flyer
---
What? It was so easy and the reward was a huge upgrade.
---
I can definitely tell that the players I all saw running around the Barrens a couple days ago, have all moved on to scarlet monastery and even ZF levels now. It's like a huge wave of players, and I missed it.
---
It gets lonely here at the bottom, without all the people I'm just auto attacking mobs to death alone for hours. Feels like leveling in retail but with slower combat at this point. I curse myself for not being able to start sooner.
---
What class do you play? I'll try to give an example specific to your class
---
My monitor is 1080p 60hz is it bad if I put the max fps to 150 lol I thought it would be good thing
---
The issue is people were 10-manning SM and it supposed to get good xp from that. Blizzard overlooked this and fixed it. Streamers who did this aren’t getting the intended classic experience by any means.
---
u/nwordcountbot u/Smixthemage
---
Also Kirtonos.
---
Is Urza's Wrench a misprint from antiquities or arabian nights?
---
The rogue wouldn't be able to loot the chests without the help of the group.
---
Much better idea than sticking to one character you only enjoy mildly all the way through. I'm at 34 now with 65 hours /played, if I were to decide now that I didn't enjoy Shaman I'd be throwing all those hours out of the window. Luckily I absolutely love it!
---
I had this in stv from a warrior asking for help in stv on a quest I had just finished. Sorry I can’t help I g2g he over pulls I save him get netted and beat to death by enraged trolls. Never again if you over pull good luck this warriors gonna watch.
---
Tell that to the mobs two levels higher than me that I'm killing like this.
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
smixthemage has not said the N-word yet.
---
Great info, thank you! You are doing all this specd into shadow?
---
Seems like it'll only be available to those already in the highly populated servers so I doubt your request will be available
---
Day 1 Level 24 checking in
---
I have a guildie with that exact name!
---
I remember going to I believe the Draenei area during Wrath as a newbie orc hunter to get the white corehound as a pet. It was such an experience, I remember having to feign death to hide from the guards on the ship that took me over there. It was such an experience that to this day it’s still one of my favorite pets.
---
30 rage is 2 sunder armors that help prevent 2 mobs from running off to the dps, or to you. Nobody is saying to never shield, just please for the love of god let me get a solid aggro lead before you do
---
Shit. I thought there was a reason I got in so fast. Cya later suckers...
---
 I know exactly where you are coming from, but transfers mean easy cash for blizzard. And tbf this isn't about a toxic player. It is a bit early for those to show up.
---
Make an alt and level tailoring on that one. Alchemy has its uses, too.
---
I got butt fucked by that 55 Elite vulture in Badlands yesterday. Even let the area know he ate my ass too. WP Blizzard.
---
I feel this hard. I just wanna be questing...
---
If it's for profit it's greed, that's the consensus for most of us. I did not downvote you
---
My server during peak hours never has a queue.
---
This is the Warrior life
---
Nah.  I go out drinking less and spend much less money.  Wow is a cheap hobby.  Even if I spend $1,000 or so on a new computer it’ll still be cheap in the long run.  Reconnecting with old IRL friends that I used to play wow with before college.  I get emails sent out and other random work done when I’m on flightpaths too.
---
Very positive experience for me so far
---
alchemy is very good
---
I open with immolate corruption agony and wand until dead I've tried agony b 4 corruption and my dps meter was higher doing corruption first
---
Using it to get around game mechanics (i.e. having to fight/escape pvp situations on a pvp server) is exploiting. I know no one cares, but exploiting is exploiting.
---
Turns out the real level 60 was the friends they made along the way?
---
Win-Shift-S if you want to get killed while taking a screenshot.
---
Honestly Classic is definitely replacing OSRS for me.
---
My favorite part of OSRS was getting a clue scroll that needed a quest or skill requirement I didn't have, so that would start a chain reaction of 5-10 different tasks I needed to complete.
---
But after a point you're spending 20-30 hours clicking the same thing over and over again. WoW questing tickles that itch perfectly.
---
Please don't.  Attack the mark.  The tank switches target too often.
---
You MIGHT run into issues against enemies in Blackrock Depths, but I don't really think you will.
---
*You think it does, but it doesn't.*   
---
\-Blizzard probably
---
Nope, if you don't move you load in fine.
---
Same here my dude
---
Eh, I keep looking at classic classes vs what rhey are now and it makes it hard.  I love shams, I like the idea of pally.... But both pretty mu h force you to heal endgame because everything else falls behind.  Same with druid. Basically have to heal if you want to raid.  Always loved war, but mained one since launch on and off.... And have 0 desire to stance dance again :p
---
Is there a way to set nameplate distance? ie you can see the nameplate from a further range. I find at max range playing on my mage I’m unable to see them so need to walk forward to be able to easily click on them.
---
Level 28
---
Yeah and while leveling, your most current big heal spell probably hits for 1/3 to half of the tank's hp. I wait and cast max rank heal followed by a renew. That easily lets me get back several seconds of regen before needing to heal again. I did sm lib+cath with a prot pally, two warriors and a hunter and had to drink less often than the pally
---
Hey now look here, maybe thats a fact but nonetheless I...
---
..gdit I did want Dikprincess first okay

12-year-old me picked Gnome because I thought girls would find it cute and they would talk to me.

---
He also tries to do it again but fails right after... not to mention he's level 30 and still loses the fight.... interesting choice of critique , typical reddit dirt bag scummy remark that I already am ready for every time I post on this platform. I'm prepped for nasty human beings like you that are just toxic to other people for no reason, just know everyone expects your generic bland boring personality and you're just another robot NPC roaming around the world trying to be cute with unintelligent comments that just insure everyone's already made up assumption of your waste of space on this planet and no one will ever accept you even as a person because you're so grotesque you have to be disrespectful to other people you don't even know. Rethink the way you associate your self with others and maybe you can be happier with your in general existence. PS don't make it so painfully obvious you're an undesirable.
---
Uh... what's happening? I see you put in "\n hello" but the GIF doesn't show anything...
---
Honestly unplayable, 5hour queues during peak times. Don’t roll there
---
Appreesh, man.  Good guy right here.
---
To be fair, Threat still builds on targets that are forced to attack you. This usually means the best way to use Taunt is to use it after you've equally the Threat of the target the mob is currently aggroed to, otherwise you'll just lose them in x amount of seconds.
---
Using Threat as your Threat's skip-to-front button is efficient and safe, keeping your group protected and allowing you to accelerate Threat gain beyond other members, or at least he ones that matter to that mob.
---
I agree with you but:
---
&gt; the drop rates are great
---
Not always lol
---
It should go to whoever wins the roll
---
well that may be true
---
Why is the rep with Communists exalted? Did I miss something?
---
Now I kind of want to try Gnomebbels
---
I plan to do it to 60. After lvl 40 I'll start putting points in disc.
---
Or maybe it worked well on Vanilla servers because i was lagging bad on those but not lagging much on Classic?
---
10 easy steps to level a warrior.
---
Step 1: Charge.
---
Step 2: Internally debate about spending precious rage on battle shout buff or rend.
---
Step 3: *Initiate parried by Pygmy crab.*
---
Step 4: Queue spawn 2 mobs within aggro range just as you sat down eat.
---
Step 5: Die.
---
Step 6: Forget to reapply find minerals after resurrection and quest for 2 hrs without it.
---
Step 7: See Step 5.
---
Step 8: See Step 7.
---
Step 9: Cry.
---
Step 10: Hit lvl 60 and tell everyone that leveling a warrior isn’t as bad as they say.
---
Yeah, if frostbite procs your group becomes scattered and Blizzard cant hit everything. 
---
I've done a decent amount of AoE farming on Whitemane, so it can be done in high pop servers.
---
You will struggle if you try to AoE farm below 26 though.  Cone of Cold REALLY helps out.  If you don't plan on farming, don't bother with the respec.  I used frostbite until 26 then I went for the respec.  It was worth it, for me.
---
Exactly that happened to me today. 
---
Didn’t knew the swimming route.
---
Outsourcing.
---
Add-on "field guide"
---
My friends can't commit to leveling a certain group, I've got 3 level 10 toons in groups.
---
Is it possible to do faction change too ?
---
Don’t even fuck with immolate tbh. I use it sometimes when I multi pull and dot up my voidwalkers target. You can get off multiple wand attacks in the time it takes to cast immolate.
---
Shit dude at least the filter doesn’t affect Reddit.
---
I ran rfk last night. First time I jumped down my succubus started taking the long way around. Luckily I realized and dismissed her in time.
---
I just remoted in from work, I seem to be good. Upstate South Carolina here.
---
&gt;Please indicate where I got all worked up.
---
Just read through your recent comment history.
---
It's not that you can be a dick because its just a game, it's that stealing a tag isn't dickish, it's just part of the game. You wouldn't get mad at someone for tackling you in a game of football; you would get mad at someone for tackling you in a grocery store.
---
Competing for tags and chests is just another aspect of the competitive nature of the game. And you are welcome to be nice and help people out, I frequently do. But expecting it as the default is unreasonable, and judging people for not playing a game *your way* is arrogant.
---
Upvote for Truman show
---
Is it worth the 1g to move all my points to shadow now?
---
I hit 60 14 year's ago no real rush to do it again.
---
I usually play 5-17 hours a day. I'm taking my time, but enjoying the lvling at my place. Constantly going between zones, professions and grinding. I might have a lot of spare time, but can confirm taking it easy is the way to go. Want a break? Just go fishing or help out a friend in need. There is no wrong way to play classic Wow after all.
---
This is Food - Myzrael, the mage,  if you need any tailoring or enchanting done let me know ;)
---
It's not lack of content, its just literally the amount of time it takes to grind out the kill quests, or the collection quests, or the running around the world to collect all the quests for the zone (lol hinterlands, only has quests from 10 other zones around the world in addition to it's own large number of quests given in the zone) and running around turning them back in.
---
Even crushing it is still like 3 hours a level, which is absurd compared to the 1.5-2 for the 40's.  Just feels like you went from pumping the brakes to just stomping on it.
---
Gearscore?  Classic.raider.io?
---
Proactive healing is a big thing in Vanilla vs Reactive healing. There are tons of helpful healing guides out there that can help you with practicing this. It may feel weird at first, but after getting into the groove of it,  it's more efficient in both your overall healing and mana consumption.
---
I poopsocked it all last week so my waiting time has been minimal. I'm back at work now like a normal person and dreading the que. I even got on in the first wave at 6PM last Monday. I really feel for the people that weren't able to enjoy the game for more then a couple hours since launch.

Were the mobs [these mobs](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9279)?
---
My name is poonstench I hope I dont get banned lol
---
You don't, and you're not, because objectively the dungeon is called DEADMINES, meaning DM. You call it whatever you want, but it ain't some objective truth. Have a good one fa.
---
Proving my point. What a sad person you must be.
---
Although I have many stories like this and I relate to you 100%. 
---
Last night an ally rouge tried to gank me. A Tauren Druid came up as we’re fighting, saw I was getting my ass kicked, and walked off. 
---
I survived and headed up to my quest spot, he pulls up behind me and invites me to a group to help him with his quest. 
---
I told him to fuck off, if you can’t help me in the battle against the alliance why would I help you on a quest.
---
What is a world drop? New player here
---
I just tanked rfc and wc for the first time last night and my god its not easy if you're new to this lol. The group was really kind and I read s fair amount about threat and how to tank but jeez it's a maze without a map.
---
"fku" - name of corpse lying dead in my factions city.
---
I usually just spam blizzard and it will keep you st the top of meter. Then hit them with the cone of cold when your about to oom and then I’ll hit evocation. Granted mages is a very thirsty class and I usually will have to drink after every fight
---
Dalaran?
---
Personally, I would say use your wand more, switch up your frostbolt rank, and don't worry too much about the meters, our job is as much utility as it is just hardcasting during a dungeon.
---
Are you single Target specced? Working into a shatter build?
---
Unsure for alliance. Horde it’s progression from Silverpine.
---
Tauren war stomp tho
---
Because when people see posts about players bitching how quest drop rates are low, it isn't a big deal if you take it slow. But if trying to quest grind to 60 and drop rates are bottlenecking the progress, it's going to frustrate players. 
---
When other players compare themselves to others that are blazing away to 60 or even clearing MC, or learning bad habits from streamers, why shouldn't other nosey players give their own PSA saying chill the fuck out?
---
It isn't even a 'everyone can play the game their way' classic isn't built to be blasted through, and so it's advice trying to urge people to slow down. There's a reason why the phrase 'Slow down and smell the flowers' and many variants exist.
---
Nah some ignore group offenders. 
---
That means you never see them looking for groups, and subsequently you can never warn people.
---
Get some kind of list add-on to keep track of offenders, instead. IMO.
---
Serinity Now has joined the game.
---
I totally feel you man.
---
What realm are you playing on atm? My main is on Sulfuras.
---
Mages are the best dps in the game, priest are the best Healers in the game. Priests are also the second worst dps in the game.
---
As far as i know, core felcloth is the biggest for classic yes
---
Personally I am of the opinion that if the goal is to race to the endgame content, thats what the other version of WOW is for. For me, Classic is for the community feels and the nostalgia of one of the best eras of warcraft.
---
I only learned about the snooping tool a few months ago.
---
If I remember right sfk and bfd has quite a few things that are good against frost. There’s a lot of factors tho. Talents, your level compared to what you are fighting, if you are switching properly to another target so you don’t waste a cast on something that will be dead by the time it hits, etc. We need more info my man.
---
Funny that you mention Paladin because it's the easiest DPS class in retail besides Arcane mage.
---
Fire/Frost mage are not intuitive or beginner-friendly but are still really easy after reading a basic rotation guide
---
Level 29.. IRL sucks. I figure if I can get 2 levels a night or even 1.5 a night I can finish the week 10-12 levels and still be 60 by October 1-7th. Naturally IRL brings in its own plot twists but should be able:
---
Nope, that's fixed.  Set by the game, just on or off.
---
Wait you fight sargeras in retail?
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
There are mods you can use but honestly its just a feel thing.  Just wait a few seconds after the tank pulls and if you are still pulling agro waiting a few more seconds.
---
Lol very relevant username
---
Oh you on Kromcrush too? 😂
---
A lot of people don't want to be here. They think they do, but they don't.
---
Bye felicia
---
Deffo hunter boots!!!
---
If you came into classic expecting it to be exactly the same as it was 15 years ago, the problem is you and not the game.
---
Hardly, but I cannot expect you to know that.
---
The easiest DPS class in retail is still more than a 1 button rotation, though, which is my point.
---
As you already said though, the fights have harder mechanics. 
---
Again, you can beat all WoW classic content with 1 finger. If you play Mage, you'll be doing your optimal rotation the whole time. 
---
I'm fairly confident in saying you can't do that on retail.
---
its not journalism its kotaku
---
Sorry! I'm on Thalnos!
---
Even though they took the power from that word and started affectionately using it for themselves.
---
Dyk(es) on bikes is an awesome part of the pride parade. In fact i bet most people who would wanna use that word would be lesbians proudly making jokes.
---
I knew you guys looked familiar! I saw you three last night and chuckled. I’m Huntbo on thunderfury. Happily in a guild but I’ll see you around!
---
I'm in the same boat as you and I if I remember correctly, the largest complaint from tanking warriors was rage starvation in classic. I am rolling a warrior as well this go around and I am spending my talent points in the Arms tree to have Tactical Mastery and Anger Management. Early in the dungeon, I pull single mobs and once I establish threat dominance, I don't spend any rage and let my rage pool. Then I manage that pool for as long as I can.
---
Warriors are extremely gear dependent. The more damage you do, the more damage you do and thus the more threat you do. Personally, I like to go for more crit so I stack agility. When I open and crit, I get a Sunder in or two and then there's no way anyone pulls that mob off me.
---
Lastly, in Classic, there was no such thing as AOEing in dungeons until the group out-geared the instance. Sheep pull and charge in so that the mobs are no where near the CC'd is how I roll.
---
This is how wow works in the background, and how retail works.
---
But they don't want it to work like that for classic.
---
Having a realm with infinite layers wiuod completely fuck those insanely crowded servers once they remove layers in phase 2...
---
Got a Warrior up to around mid-level in Burning Crusade. I don't remember the spec being this fucking brutal to play.
---
I'm level 13 now. I can't even solo mobs around my level in Westfall, and I'm not talking about the mechanical harvest golems that are immune to my rend either. I'm talking about the other mobs that I can use my dot on. My gear is half-green half-white. My weapon was an AH bought two hander with relevant stats.
---
Arms is complete and utter wank to play at low level. Surely there's another spec that Warriors can level in?
---
Should have rolled a nelf.
---
t. warrior
---
Ah yea its good to be back. My barrens chat had a couple of great Keanu Reeves meme's. Some Anal Dirge and a couple of other lovely shit posts.. 
---
i .. love ... to .. be ..back!
---
p.s.
---
Keanu is a warrior. Keanu Cleaves.
---
Keanu is a tree. Keanu Leafes.
---
Keanu likes to steal. Keanu Thieves.
---
Keanu played wotlk. Keanu Jeeves.
---
I mean, everyone in the pserver community have cleared these bosses for years on end, I should hope that we know how to kill them by now. Looking forward to seeing the LFR heroes raging at deep breath on Onyxia though.
---
OP who looted the hide here. 
---
When I skinned it in vanilla, the skinning market was garbage because of rampant bots. The only chance you had of making decent profit was skinning the hide of the beast, which has either a 1% or 0.1% drop chance, required Finkle's Skinner and the skinning glove enchant. Compared with mining (DI ore) and herbalism (elixirs were big-ticket items for AQ and naxx, pots were huge for pvpers) skinning wasn't worth the time or profession slot.  
---
I assume Blizzard has better bot detection now, so hopefully it's not the same story this time around.
---
Haha it did feel a little like that. They seemed AFK so we attacked the lowest level. Then they gangbanged us to the graveyard.
---
Yeah I just abandoned my 43 Mage on Herod last night and rerolled on Kromcrush. Now I'm not sure what to do with this announcement since I know for sure Herod will be one of the servers getting the free xfers. Do I keep leveling on Kromcrush and pray Kromcrush is one of the server I'll be able to xfer to or just wait for Blizz to announce the acceptable realms.
---
If I come across anyone who's pulled too much or about to die I'll help them out, but if it's a warrior I will help them and save them from a death run and then trade them a healthstone before continuing on my travels.
---
Thanks bud. Gonna respec tonight to burn some baddies (and the occasional critters)!
---
Hahaha, yeah, at Vanilla launch lots of players had the same problems, many quit because of it. For the first several months of the game, people at 60 actively complained how boring it was. They started adding stuff as time went on and now in retail it's to the point where leveling is just a joke and there's more activities to do at max level than most people can get around to.
---
TBH, if you're already getting bored with classic, you might just want to give retail a shot. This sub has a raging hate boner for retail, but it's still a good game and you might enjoy it based off your issues here.
---
Fair.
---
Probably based on how many you're expected to use in a given fight. Like if a hunter uses 600 arrows for some boss, class designers expected warlocks to use 3 soul shards for the same boss, and vice versa... maybe?
---
Sorry bud I'm not grading your thesis on getting out damaged by a tank in classic.  If you think a decent dps should get out dpsed by a tank you're wrong.
---
It's bad until AQ solely because there are quite a few bosses in MC and BWL that are just immune to fire damage. So as fire you would actually do 0 dmg.
---
Whats a world drop mean? Noob here
---
bro im level 10 and i think 3s is a bit to get angry over
---
he could use the time he wasted to complain to this person by killing one mob and offset the loss
---
Flying ruined the game, I agree. Secondarily, automatic flight points also played a part.
---
The game is better when people are out in the world.
---
Focus on Arms while leveling IMHO.
---
Glad you are enjoying it! Here is a good video for hunter leveling: https://youtu.be/gKx3qqbdMfY
---
omg, I had no idea
---
I did 1-60 in vanilla as a warrior too, when misses/parries/dodges gave no rage and some other nice *features* of the class. The quests in Andorhal were extremely range inducing due to the claustrophobic nature of the city (by then, walled), the mob density, the nastiness of the diseases by the ghouls, etc.
---
I ended tanking MC, Onyxia and BWL with that warrior, so I have fond memories of what it was...but the leveling experience was atrocious.
---

That would involve contacting them and I've decided, mostly from this thread, that I don't want contact with these toxic people any longer :D
---
I love being a mage. Everyone time I see a non-mage I trade them food and water. One tauren warrior tried giving me 3s as a thanks and I said no. He kept chasing me down and upping the silver until I finally caved. So much fun and funny interactions!
---
Ferlas is one of my favorite zones in the game.  Also, where I get my favorite pet, the sprite darter hatchling.  Actually just need to finish out the Hinterlands portion of the quest tonight.
---
I think the population is based on how many are online at that time, my server is low pop at 4am when I finish work but high at 3-4pm before I go to work
---
Great, why does that matter? Don't kill those mobs. There is a marginal exp increase that doesn't make u for the difficulty. 
---
Warriors have the best 2 target cleave in the game and if utilized properly, it makes them on par with other classes easily. Also to add their incredible strength for damage and tanking in dungeons, they are underrated for leveling.
---
Possible to get a refund on your sub fee.  Not usually possible to get a pause though.  Because essentially, you could ask for a pause every time you log out stating that you shouldn't have to pay for time you are not using.
---
Yeah the good thing is without quests I don't really need alot of bag space
---
Will try this tomorrow. Thanks.
---
thanks for the lovely new word. I love how germans mash so many words together lol its fun to lsiten to
---
What it's going to do in both of the "stuck" and teleport to nearest graveyard scenarios is try and find the nearest graveyard to stick you in.  There might be a problem there.
---
However, if that were the case, you should be able to just walk out or hearthstone out.  You don't show any attempt to do that in the video, so I don't know 100% if that fails.
---
If that fails, there's a possibility that the barrens could be down.  If this were the case, it would give you (and anyone else) who was trying to log into a character in the barrens the message that the world server was down. I THINK the continents kind of are each individual servers, so logging in your troll means that's not really the case.
---
However, we have layers.  So what might have happened is that when you got remove from the group, you somehow got transfered to an invalid layer. Maybe a layer that closed down or maybe it doesn't know what layer to put you in because you're no longer in a group. 
---
What I don't know is why you don't show an attempt to walk out or hearth out of the instance.  If the problem is "If you are removed from the group you then can't leave" it's going to affect a lot more people than if it's "If you manage to use your hearthstone, and then come into the zone while it's on cooldown, and then get removed from the zone, and then click "Stuck" in the get help, to kill you and transfer you to an invalid graveyard you get stuck in limbo" then it's a lot less likely to randomly occur. 
---
You imply that you tried hearthing, but it's not shown. My guess is it's a layering issue rather than a invalid graveyard data, but given what you showed I think both are reasonable.
---
I - Miraje am Mage other clothie is warlock. Our healer was a paladin with all his points in protection lolol.
---
But it really isn't though. Let's be real, people won't be spending 1000s, 100s, or even 10s of gold for the high end consumables for raiding when everyone already knows perfect strategies. I'm talking about the high end, hardcore guilds here. Casuals wouldn't have the gold to spend on them anyway. 
---
Practically speaking, alchemy will not make you nearly as much gold as it did in real vanilla, if or makes you any at all.
---
Don't feel like you shouldn't run it more than once. I fucking love running instances and I did Deadmines three times in a row in a single evening as soon as I hit 18. I've run it five times now and would honestly run it again. Can't wait to gain another few levels because there are a lot of instances available around level 25, I'm gonna have a field day =D
---
Honestly that's cool for some and sucks for others...  
---
That's one of the reasons I joined a PvE server was so that I could choose when I felt like PVP'ing.  Having limited play time a situation like that where I am trying to run from point A to point B and end up spending a bunch of time dealing with PvP would get very annoying.  
---
In my younger days when I had more time to play I had a couple toons on a PVP server and would log on when I was in the frame of mind and had the time to deal with the random fights that would break out on a PVP server.
---
My wife was playing my mage today (level 19) and she was definitely also struggling against the dragons. Spellcaster mobs in general hit like trucks. Keep Dampen Magic up on yourself and get close enough to finish it with a quick Fire Blast once it gets in the 40-80 HP range, you need to try and finish the fight ASAP.
---
Drinking and eating between each fight with a caster is to be expected.
---
Come back to us Cranius 😢
---
I don't know I've been grinding too hard all week lol
---
They'll probably limit where people can transfer too.  Like server 2 can only transfer to server 4 or 5, server 3 can only transfer to 5 or 7 etc based on pops
---
i'm like lvl 9
---
I know this is a late reply, but 12 Wool is only enough for 1 bag.
---
You need 3 Bolts per bag, which is made from 9 Wool Cloth total.
---
4 Bags would require 36 Wool Cloth.
---
There was toxicity, but it was nowhere near the level it is now. My skin is considerably thicker now, and this bullshit is insane. My block list is three full scrolls deep, now. That's easily 75+ names.

Rattlegore has two MAGAt guilds on both sides, and they're always spamming "TRUMP2020" in trade, general and localdefense.
---
Wave at my homies because I’m not an alliance scum
---
The thing about vanilla is that you can tank in any spec you want. I would highly recommend leveling in Arms tree and if you want to tank a dungeon, throw on your shield and 1h weapon and start tanking. Its that easy, especially in low level dungeons.
---
I haven't been able to log-in for the past 3 hours or so. Battle.net is down and trying to log-in manually just disconnects me. I'm in Texas.
---
I play nelf hunter (my original toon just like every other fuckboy out there) and the joke within my group of friends is that I just went nelf so I could have cheetah while dead too. 
---
Maybe they wouldn’t be so jealous if 3 of them didn’t play warrior
---
I had some horrible bag luck, not a single bag drop until 40...then I got THE bag, Journeyman's Backpack.
---
They are talking about 1 week though lol. The guy might travel everyday to the most beautiful places on earth and just took a week off to play WOW and you are saying he needs to get out more... you have no context.
---
I highly doubt they will offer PVP -&gt; PVE transfers. That was not the case in vanilla and it doesn't make sense now either. Sorry friend.
---
I dont get where new first time players got the mentality to just be like you why cant u just play the game, I mean u can ask stuff ingame if you really need to, theres no reason to ask on reddit for beginners tips they are everywhere
---
Even more obnoxious than mematic's watermarks lol

Dual boxing for fun is fine, but 10x fire blasting mage multiboxers deserve a special place in hell.

On my server, stacks of light leather are being posted for just over 3s. You can vendor a stack for 3s, so I just vendor them. (Yes, there are still people posting stacks for multiple gold... don't know why).

I've come to the conclusion that most of the people that get salty are the ones that wish they could be doing the same thing but can't.
---
SM is a joke too honestly but I'm just sick of arguing about it. You do you.
---
I didn't force anyone to cater towards me, in fact like I said I didn't even end up grouping with them for quests. Everyone else I have joined besides these 2 groups has been great, so yes I think it's normal to assume that the majority of players are not speed leveling. Everyone else I grouped with has been cool.  You don't have to agree with me or make me agree with you. We disagree who cares. I'm really nice to people in game and help others if I can, not sure how you assume I am such an evil selfish person from a simple story.  I never once said people have to play how I want them to...its not a big deal calm down.
---
yep, you can't even equip the drops until 13.

Knowing that Horde is a far superior faction I would simply /bow and hope for mercy
---

You bind that on tab? Is this the norm or not thinking this correctly?
---
Something that always bothered me about the Perception racial: Don't humans, in most fantasy settings have the WORST Perception of any other race? I feel like Perception should be an elf trait, and humans should have gotten a on-use heal called "Rally" which rapidly regenerates a portion of their HP. In fantasy settings, humans are the type to pull together in the darkest hour and rally for victory.
---
Classic cast bars.
---
Yes, all the classic servers have their own forums now. Most aren't super active yet as everyone is spending every free moment playing the game like Thrall intended.
---
Causal
---
APES exploited the game. A lot of people did, but just because some very organized players did it wont mean shit for the VAST majority of classic players. And TBH classic was harder on different levels. Retail is hard also, probably harder than classic in terms of mythic raiding. But solo play / dungeons are much harder. 
---
Also the challenge of gearing up a character in classic was way harder than retail. Sometimes you have to raid for months before getting a upgrade.
---

It seems that people think you are one person playing two characters and that there is no way you are playing both efficiently.

I refused to GY rez on my first character. A matter of principle. I'm not so high and mighty now. I used it last night just to get back to the town to turn in my quests.
---
Well back in the day it was VC what can I say. Was it stupid or no? That is not for me to say.
---
Honestly, I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a long time. Well beyond my expectations. 
---
It's so cool meeting people running a dungeon with them, and then randomly finding them again later on. It has a feel of a tight knit community but with thousands of people. Also, someone today opened a trade with me to give me an enchant on my shield in orgimar. Someone I have never met before,  and will probably never see again. Didn't even ask for money!
---
It would have been a perfect ending if he then proceeds to kill you anyways. Fair fight and all after all at that point.
---
Just hit 29 on my first ever warrior. Is our rage generation awful for low level tanking or do I need to git gud
---
I like the A-S-D for foward and strafe, makes total sense but I guess its bc I play a rogue, I walk backwards all the time just I guess out of habit /neccessity / bad play lol?
---
So like I start with a cheap shot, stabby choppy stabby a few attacks, then maybe gouge.  When leveling PvE mobs, they have really odd hitboxes and if you dont backup, a lot of the time they stand right on top of you and certain skills that have to be placement based (most rogue skills) end up having errors.
---
Gouge will fail when they are right on top of you, Cheap Shot will fair if you are too close but still technically behind, Garrote, Ambush Backstab etc.  So I just go used to making sure im like 2-3 feet (steps or whatever) either in front of or behind a mob.  Also if its a packed area and I dont want the mob to run when it gets low and trigger another pack, ill slowly back it up as I continue to auto and its nearing death.
---
Maybe I overthink it but its what works for me.

Dwarf hunter, have the time of your life that's my advice, and don't let the tediousness of pet and ammo management ruin the game for you, it's actually a pretty immersive class and is also my main as well.
---
PLAY HOW I SAY NOT HOW THE PEOPLE I DISAGREE WITH SAY HOW TO PLAY.
---
Op this post was needed but I really wish that it wasn't. IDK why just do what makes you happy dosent apply to video games same as everything else in life. 
---
Do you have the time but wish you had more going on irl? its fine. Do you have 50 kids and 3 jobs, wish you had more time to play? Also fine. The reality of the situation is no one cares either way.
---
You can just say paladin
---
Didn't he say during the beta that he was never going to accept fan trades? He's free to do what he wants, but I thought that he was all about the legit classic experience. Grinding for mount is part of that. Isn't he gonna burn out on classic faster by bypassing a memorable grind and reward like that?
---
Yup I plan on AHing this dagger when prices stabilize. A thrifty person would buy them off the AH now when they’re cheap and resell when people are gearing alts and the price increases to 20g
---
You’ll be 60 farrrrrr longer than the time it took you to get there. You’ll wish you could have it back

My first char was a night elf warrior, and her passive saved me from gankers many times
---
How often do people talk about your name while in game?
---
It gets better as you level. You should be using 1h swords while you are leveling, and don’t waste your energy so quick. Do a sinister strike, auto, sinister and repeat, then eviscerate for the kill or when you have 5 combo points. It’s get even more fun when you’re doing some pvp cause you can stop people health before they even know you’re attacking them.
---
If I party with someone who's 8 levels below me, is he getting xp penalized for the difference? Or just me?
---
I know we get less xp per kill just because we're in a party, I'm just asking about a penalty for the level difference
---
Nah I played Vanilla hunter and had no issues. Played up to Wrath and then stopped restarted on Legion before I left WOW all together. The class had it rough spots but still was enjoyable for me
---
Wingblade is infinitely better for warriors than cs
---
Even still you can ignore quite a lot of fast 2h weapons since skills use your average damage, and slow weapons tend to have higher damage average.
---
That's why weapons such as corpsemaker with it's 3.8 attack speed are insanely good.
---
To summarize your post from above, before normalization slow weapons received extra bonus from attack power due to their speed. That got removed, now skills just use average damage, which still does favor slow weapons.

Why would this be something Activision does? They are one company and have been for a long time.
---
You wanna talk about it?
---
So I have 2 large groups of friends that I've played WoW with and who I game with in general. The "Old Guard" guys I played with from BC on were set on going Alliance, and the other set definitely going horde to relive their glory in classic.
---
I prefer Alliance for their zones, etc - And that group of friends had decided they were playing classic earlier so I was dedicated to the cause of Alliance this time around.
---
Instead of making it some sort of fight for friendship, I figured out what server my horde buds wanted to play on (Whitemane) and pushed for my Alliance team to do the same. Now not only do I get to gank horde, but I get to gank my friends.
---
Some of you probably thing that's nightmarish and that it's "unfriendly" but I think it's going to be the most fun we could have playing WoW.
---
Those friends were shit to take it out on you - but it might have been a fun opportunity to challenge them to the same kind of thing.
---
Plus if they're so concerned about playing with you then they'd be open to joining you on the server you chose. So unless you agreed to playing with them in the first place, they're in the wrong.
---
Having so much fun ganking in Hillsbrad.
---
I do but it keeps on happening and its pretty annoying
---
Is this satire?
---
Or start your own!
---
What class are you? 
---
If you are a warrior or druid it could be changing when you switch stances or forms.
---
found out by rolling a dwarven rogue and killing shit quick then i equipped a sword and dagger off hand and loved it more
---
If I think I can kill you I'm attacking you.
---
Here's a story cuz why not.
---
I was leveling in shimmering flats and I ganked some druid then did some quests I saw him res so I killed him again I saw him res a 3rd time and instantly go stealth so I started not letting myself get low then a horde rogue walks by and I'm like hey buddy this druid really wants to gank me stealth and kill him when he opens and the rogue says ok I let myself drop to 50% the druid ravages me to like 3% I pot and bear form as he tries to moonfire for the kill and the rogue opens killing this poor pleb for the 3rd time in 15 mins.
---
You cannot defeat me plebs, I'm in your head.
---
So i break it down into categories that fit me best. 
---
1. I start by race,  actually its really important because you'll have to look at this character constantly. 
---
So you picked a race.
---
2. so do you want to fight hand to hand or by range? So narrow the selection down to that. 
---
When you have a paladin its a hand to hand combat class, so its easier to compare that with warriors, and rogues. 
---
So maybe that might help a little bit.
---
For tank, stamina. For dps, agi.
---
It is pretty weird. Dreadmist peak has enemies that drop linen all the time. I mean its so constant when I farm that place on my mage I can get around 100 of them in 30 minutes. 
---
Im lvl 22 so I don’t expect to be getting tons of wool. I just find it weird that its drop rate is non existent in the areas wowhead says it drops at. Compared to other cloths the drop rate seems skewed.
---
It's probably the terrible faction choice that's putting you off. For The Alliance! 
---
Stick with the rogue for a bit longer I'd say. 
---
If you go with a range dps then consider the below for classic.
---
Mage - You'll be expected to provide food and water all the time, maybe portals too, also by the time you've buffed your team you need to drink again. Their rotation for MC raiding is basically frostbolt spam, but top the dps charts.
---
Warlocks - Micromanagement with the soul shards collecting could get annoying.
---
Hunter - By far the most micromanagement of any class in classic. 1 less bag slot than other classes, arrow restocking, pet taming/feeding/leveling/training/pet skill gathering by taming further pet. 
---
I'm playing hunter and enjoying the questing side of things but finding it a bit meh in the dungeon setting. Just hit level 50 and think I'll level a mage or walock next.

But if you post somewhere else on the 2nd account with a screenshot of your 1st account's messages with the mods of r/news and your second account has posts in r/news since the ban that would be ban evasion. The r/news mod wouldn't have to be a mod of that other subreddit. It only comes into play here because thats why the mod saw this post.

---
&gt;I'm shadow but can heal
---
All there is to it. A shadow priest is still probably about as good of a healer as a resto shaman, and we have the advantage of healing gear being almost identical to spriest leveling gear.
---
If they've got a problem, that's on them; but you avoid people going "wAiT aRe YoU ShAdOw?!" after a wipe since they knew ahead of time.
---
Hunter?
---
Back into the basement with you! It puts the WoW on it's screen or else it gets the hose again.
---
There are a lot of people in that bucket. I used to be one of them and pretended I didn't have a mic. 
---
It changes with time as people become more comfortable with voice, however. I generally prefer voice over text now.
---
You can proc enrage, just requires timing it right. Im no expert but with a weapon swing timer addon and a /sit macro i can have it up most fights while leveling. The trick is to be seated while the mob is starting its swing, so you get crit, and stand up is its coming through. This meant i had a 25% dmg boost on most of the time, also i found fury beginning talents to be way more impactful. Cruelty, imp demo, imp bs, and howl are really good. That being said, im respeccing to arms for sweeaping strikes and eventually Mortal strike. Also as pvp is becoming more of a factor, i kind of need tactical mastery.

No idea?

Gatekeeping been in the game forever, and will always be here, no point in trying to bullshit. You can even blame it on yourselves for bashing into peoples brains that each class has one end game spec and everything else is useless but a raid will still drag your ass around because they need 40 people

Whack-a-mole = complex rotation, got it.

Fuckin a.

Kinda cringe bro
---
This is quality.
---
K you can get off your high horse of "for the greater good" and deal with it. If you didn't have the foresight to see that they would eventually have to get to this point of offering transfers, then you've learned a valuable lesson today. Never put a billion dollar company ahead of yourself and your desires because ultimately they have to cater to what you want to keep you as a customer. 
---
I know it sucks that people are going to be further ahead of you once they transfer in, but what are you losing? Were you in contention for a realm first? You're about to get more people to play with (or ignore) and overall it doesn't impact your playing experience unless you choose to be a sourpuss about it.
---
Alt + z you casual
---
Id rather start a new char to join my frenz than play alone at 60
---
I do not, because I think it's hilarious playing a 15 year old MMO in 4k with ultra graphics.  Also, I played vanilla for years with a crappy graphics card and 10-25fps, I earned this!
---
I just hit level 18 on my warrior. None of my friends play wow either so I am stuck solo leveling which makes it even more difficult :( I am determined to get to 60 though solo just to prove I could do it. I do wish I had friends to play wow with though!
---
But how do I get riposte damage without stripping off a melee mob from the tank?
---
Also are there any other servers, buddy is looking for a Warrior and Mage one
---
kind of funny. you might deserve it.
---
probably not, but welcome to horde v alliance bruh
---
If it is in fact a keyboard shortcut you are hitting, and not something like switching stances/form then I would check the keybindings option in settings, there should be a section with addon specific keybinds, maybe you can at least track down and disable the keybind you keep accidentally hitting?
---
for you and me maybe, but to each their own and all that jazz.

I don't really care about gold. I'll get it and if I need I'll work for it. But for now, I just want to give back some to the community :-)

LOL upvoted

I was ganking horde coming out of BFD earlier, managed to get more than a few people. Until the last one I tried to gank layered out at 10% health, only to reappear five minutes later at full health (wasn’t near the the instance portal), either).

Just irritated me so I moved on. Other than that, if I see red, and I can take them, I will.

Hah horde have the same problem. It's a contested zone with a long entry path, PvP in front of the dungeon is unavoidable.

Wrong. If they decide to do retro servers they should be no changes, end of story. If you don't like it don't play on them. If the Classic cult can make that argument then so can I.
---
I think he said he wouldnt accept gold while lvling to 60.
---
No worries :)  I figure it's easier to keep an eye on both when they're not so far apart.
---
Getting behind the curve as a streamer would be an absolute disaster. They deal with stream snipers enough when they are at the same level, imagine if there were hundreds of people lvl 60 and they are still trying to do lvl 40 quests.
---
I forgot to boot up my computer before leaving for work this morning.

I hope I'm able to even play today.

Too many people? Since when does it become more difficult to click a server name, enter a char name, then press enter world the more people there are? If you can't coordinate a fucking server change then you guys are gonna be too stupid to finish end game content anyways.

Gotchya. It sounds like you had the unfortunate experience of rolling with a premade. He probably took it for an alt character. Considered very rude among the dungeon crawling community
---
The only way I would move is if a new server was opened up, and transfers got priority over creating a new character. I'm not giving up my name!
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm just explaining where the hate comes from. I personally don't have a huge problem with it, but if you're trying to say there's no advantages to multiboxing that's just clearly wrong. The point with multiboxing isn't that your 5 characters are better than 5 separate players, but that your 5 characters are virtually unbeatable someone solo questing. It's effectively pay to win to some extent, and that's why people dislike it.
---
This is exactly what I had in mind.. " And don't renew before a pull. "  ... What? You mean after combat has initiated? Because you can renew and shield before a pull just fine when you're NOT in combat.. Then just drink when they are doing the first 5 seconds of the pull... Been doing this for years

You realize they'd be offering server transfers with what you described, as well, right?
---
If they had just threw up a bunch of servers, down the line you'd have people wanting server merges and transfers when  there's a ton of low pop servers. 
---
Theres no real perfect solution here, and this route at the very least allows servers to stay largely populated.
---
"What do we do now?"
---
"What do you mean.? Now we play the game...... okay Kyle drink elixer of fortitude"
---
Fun fact, because of that episode I started playing the game. Got to be a Vanilla OG before TBC hit.
---
The cycle continues.  This has all happened before.  It will all happen again.
---
Blizz themselves are expecting the population to significantly fall. That's why they are using the layering system instead of 100 different servers
---
A boss or a mob is hard when it has its own skillset and attack pattern that will require you to adjust your playstyle to beat it. In WoW, a hard mob is harder than an easy mob because its numbers are modified higher.
---
A "kill 10 wolves" quest, is exactly the same in both retail and in classic. Sure, in retail you can pull all of em at the same time and nuke em down, while in classic you will need to pull one by one and eat inbetween pulls. That does not make it HARD, that makes it just more time consuming than the other one. You do not have to dodge any attack, you do not have to line of sight, you do not have to interrupt chain and whatnot. It's just an autoattacking mob with high hp and damage modifiers.

To be be fair “Holocaust” kind of means “mass destruction and slaughter” which is a fairly awesome gaming name.   
---
I came from somewhere with a relatively small Jewish population so I don’t get a lot of exposure, and I have to admit that when I hear holocaust, I don’t necessarily think immediately of “ The Holocaust^TM “

Here's the build, at level 60 I might change some things (maybe dropping improved gouge). There are some talents I still really want for everyday use (improved sprint).
---
I only engage near cliffs.
---
Am priest.
---
Who’s he? 
---
The GM told me that the name isn’t taken, did you not read what I posted. I was hoping/wondering if other people had ran into the same issue I have?
---
I’ve been playing and having a blast, I just want my name as well. 
---
You seem really upset about this it’s very strange.
---
So the person who posted here has since posted on the banned sub with their other account? I was under the impression that simply talking about it in r/classicwow was enough for the mod. I don’t disagree that actually posting on a sock in r/wow is definitely ban evasion.
---
Honorable? In my WPVP? Yesterday I saw a Dwarf Priest three levels lower than me running away from a bad pull in Hillsbrad. So I killed him. THEN, I told everyone in General Chat about him, and he had to corpse run his ass all the way back to his quest hub.
---
Sure, I *could* let the Alliance group trying to make a WC run go there in peace. Sure, I *could* ignore that harmless Priest running for their life. But the zones are so much prettier when they're littered with Alliance bodies. Nothing puts an extra pep in my step than seeing an Ally trying to find a new Flight Path and knowing I'm about to make their day a *little* more miserable.
---
I went for omen of clarity, then furor, then natural shape shifter, then into feral. The freedom to change forms, have resources when you enter them and still have mana to heal and stuff has been such a great boon for me, especially in world pvp
---
Should I vendor my wool/linen cloth or sell them on the AH? Same for the different leathers
---
You dont ever take frostbite
---
You need to plug it in ... literally.
---
triggered
---
Makes for more interesting items as well. IIRC the BiS feral waepon drops from Gnomer.
---
organizing enough people to do those raids are the hard part
---
oh damn thanks that sounds good, i'll do tja
---
I thought this was about people racing to turn 60 years old...
---
how much gold do you think I should buy to affect your existence? I should go through and look at which server you're on, figure out which gold sellers are more rampant there, and buy exclusively from them.
---
I had these drop on my prot warrior in vanilla... good times
---
Warlock is fun, you can go to the barrens, set a giraffe on fire, cast fear and watch it run around as it burns... They do other things too but i'm pretty sure that's the pinnacle of playing the class.
---
There are two issues with early rogue levels.
---
First, you are missing some of the major parts of being a rogue, namely Vanish and Distract (both level 22).  That allows you to escape if you mess up, and adjust mob positions so you can open up from stealth.  Rogues have a lot of issues during the teens, so I'd try making friends with an alchemist or pickpocketing for a few extra potions.
---
Second, playing a Combat spec doesn't really feel *roguelike*.  I respec to subtlety as soon as I hit level 30.  It might take you a bit longer to level, but that beats giving up on the class entirely.
---
Lots and lots of guilds will actively be using discord or some sort of voice chat, you are more likely to your social itch by trying to find a friendly social guild that actively used voice chat, that way you get to know those people personally and they will likely hop in voice chat everytime they play :)
---
Training is costing me a fortune. I'm skipping skills, but mages cant skip too horribly much, imo. But training enchants is getting out of control. I like to have my enchantment arsenal filled,  because it makes me feel like a good lil gnome. I enchant all of my dungeon group to the fucking roof, because they let me need everything not needed. So I end up getting a bunch of mats in exchange for lvling up my enchanting so it's a win win. I'm at 225 enchant, and I feel that's pretty good. So, I don't sell mats or greens so I lose a lot of money that way, but my enchanting is godly for this point in the game. If I need a tank or healer for a group, I offer a free enchant and it's super easy to get some really decent people to come.
---
People today : Thats not going to be me
---
People tomorrow:  Really need to finish this set before weekly reset!
---
Nuke Nuke Pain, not Nuke Pain Nuke, because of cast times/resets. Miss half a tick of pain but get an extra swing with the wand.
---
How do you know what to buy/sell and at what price? I financed a few characters in vanilla by flipping BiS twink blues/purples but in the early days of the classic market I really have no idea what has value and what doesn't and what kind of value.
---
Hi never played classic before. Can anyone recommend a parser pls?
---
The game was designed to be played with text, emotes, and icons being the primary means of communication. Ventrilo and Team Speak were both relatively new and mostly only used by people who directly new each other or had already developed something of a relationship back in the early years of the game. So I can see why people returning to the game might be hesitant or unwilling to voice-chat.
---
I agree that direct voice chatting is more engaging socially, but it also requires a lot more attention and effort than text-chatting. A lot of people playing this game are engaged in other things while they play so being in direct communication is inconvenient or annoying.  I hope you can find some players to direct chat but I definitely wouldn't expect it.
---
Right here yo. Rogue, Warlock, Warrior.
---
Yeah but guess what? When most people started playing vanilla there were already guilds downing Rags and Ony.
---
With WoW Classic there's always gonna be the "OMGZ WORLD FERST GAIZ LEZ ALL WACH IT ON TWICH AN GET MILLON VEWS!" That's just the world we live in now.
---
I'm looking forward to seeing how these world first plebs go against your average rank 12-14 vanilla PVP'er once the battlegrounds come out. That'll be the true test for the game, when the powerhouse vanilla PVP'ers start dominating the twitch streamers.
---
Everything looks better on a gnome.
---
The problem I have with generation grouping, is that there is no hard official line for it. Anyone can make up a timeframe. I've seen organizations put millennials from 1980 - all the way to 2000. My agency used this as their demograph map for the work force. I was born in 84, I've been married 15 years, have a 14 year old kid, deployed to combat twice in the early 2000's, and am half way to retirement benefits for public service. How the fuck can you group me with a 23 year old that hasn't even graduated college and lives with their parents, to any meaningful metric? I was getting my drivers license when they were still drooling on themselves and using sippy cups. I'm not as salty about it as I seem, I promise. I just think a 15 - 20 year generation is too long for getting any meaningful data out of it, which is all the media uses it for.

I am guilty of using other players as bait when i know there is a stealth class around. I'm like their Undead Guardian Assassin Angel

I'm level 10 and finally out of Dun Moroh. I'm feeling pretty good about myself.
---
I played DPS on retail for nearly a decade, so I didnt feel the need to do that again, and a friend was making a tank, so healer was the only real choice. I also wanted a better chance to get into dungeon groups and it sounded like fun.
---
Been great so far, lvl 27 priest. Almost old school levels of addiction.

I thought this was a post about not doing dungeons with rands cuz they're braindead at first

How can I check what quests I have completed? Trying to do a chain quest and I think I dropped one and now can't find what part to resume on.

Probably. But I can now officially say I'm a troll hunter with a rare carrion bird that can only be found in alliance territory 😈
---
&gt; I could do the same with a mage, or a warlock. 
---
exactly.
---
you're arguing past the point. high weapon dmg is great for hunters just as spell dmg is really good for casters but it's not necessary for leveling. the baseline with a crappy weapon is good enough to level quickly. that's not the case for warrior. they're directly bound to weapon dmg.
---
This kind of fanboy nonsense is why it's so easy to make fun of gaming communities.
---
See now that sounds Hella fun too me
---
Depends on your server. There is a little leeway on PvE servers, but on PvP Arms is the way to go.
---
Very good job Blizzard. Every single move they take, it is the right one! Keep it up fellas!
---
Yeah world chat is super fucking toxic unfortunately. Had to leave it. First few days of the game people were generally good vibes but now that the dust has settled people seem to argue about everything and are consistently toxic. I don’t think there’s a way to see the alli and horde spread unfortunately but I could be wrong.
---
I love this game, wish I had been there.
---
If someone is logged in to the same server as your character is, it will show their name, level, and class.
---
My roommate and started up after quitting post wotlk. My fiancée asked if she could buy a computer to play with us. What have we done?

I honestly read this the first time as some good advice on life.

I'm not talking about level 25 greens, more like level 5-15 greens.
---
I'm an Orc with the Axe racial, which is supposed to give me +5 to axe weapons, yet when I level them up to my current character/mob level, I'm still missing some swings. Why is that?
---
Bro, same?! :O
---
Im pretty lucky that my wife is totally understanding that I’m excited about classic,  but she’s starting her hovering act of “hello what are you doing” after the 6th day of me playing 4+hours at a time and working 9-5. Granted, it’s really like 6 hrs because of the damn queues! I’m lvl 27 and I feel like I’ve been playing nonstop! Idk how people are raiding already. It’s almost like I have to pay attention to her periodically or something. 
---
I’ll probably mellow out to a couple hours a night for 3-5 days per week after another week or two. It’s fun just playing the game. Why rush?!
---
A Gnome decked out in plate with a massive 2h axe is the greatest thing known to WoW.
---
You are correct. However I don't see Blizzard enforcing those rules. For example there is a rule that you shouldn't have a name that consists of two words yet there are many people who have such names. Maybe RP servers really attract a different crowd - who knows.
---
Fair enough. I find the majority to be reasonable and helpful.  I hope that's your experience going forward.
---
I remember during vanilla era, these were the first (and only) epic world drop I got. I wasn't alone either with this specific equip and it seems that trend continues. Makes me wonder if the boots just more common than other things.
---
You are wrong about that. I used to run all of the different Dire Maul wings.

Bros if a guild wants to impress me they should try to go clear all 3 opposition capitals in one shot.

I waited till 13 to get a wand and while it saved me money, it was a big struggle from 11-13 especially, lots of drinking/staff swinging. I'd get the req. lv 8 one.
---
Don’t worry about and just enjoy Classic is how I currently feel.
---
Lvl 17 here, dreaming of getting seal of command at 20 :p
---
Not true at all. I definitely didn't do this twice this past weekend in deadmines, no sir.
---
Spec elemental, gear prioritizing intel/spirit and use a shield / fast one hand with flame tongue. Open with flame shock drop searing maybe cast a lightning bolt and melee them down with flame tongue. It’ll be much faster and you’ll maintain mana better with clear casting and a higher mana pool.
---
Enhancement is an awful spec, even at leveling. Been trying to tell everyone this but you always get the swarm of noobs insisting sitting that auto attacking every 3 seconds and rolling a dice hoping windfury procs is the way to go.
---
People have already killed Rag in classic?
---
Jesus the amount of time it took until first kill on rag when wow came out was crazy long (both globally and the server I was on).
---
I'm using NugEnergy. I also have WeakAuras but I found that the weakaura energy tickers stick sometimes which is really distracting
---
Are the feww server transfers confirmed? When will they be available?
---
They will close down the servers in 2025 they said
---
Just read the comments and saw this was on Pyrewood. I was there v briefly with my bf to cook some stuff at the campfire :p Knew this seemed familiar haha
---
How is Bloodfang doing right now?
---
There is a reason people joke about priest's Wand Spec - thats literally 60-80% of my damage on mobs :p
---
They’ll most likely for sure do BC, dunno about Wrath. The game started to change a lot in Wrath and for the worst at that. The Lich King was great and all but Wrath introduced a lot of the features people dislike today that also go against the Classic vision the devs have.
---
I checked him this morning on 2 layers he was empty, but i will keep going back when I can. Nose hard into that grindstone right now. Hopefully early tomorrow morning!
---
Not even kidding, I saw them drop twice in two different runs of ZF. I got one and a guildie got the other pair. Out of all the epics Ive seen being looted and heard that they apparently dropped for friends or guild, this epic came to talk for about 4-5 times
---
Not to mention you stop building aggro on the mobs still attacking you as you run to collect strays.  Then the healer draws aggro on them because of course its right at the start of the fight.  And you run around like mad instead of keeping everything in a nice group that can tab sunder.
---
Makes a guy want to quit tanking to just sit in back and pew pew.
---
On the same servers? Like, should I take video of myself logging into a server with no queue during peak times or do you want to just try it yourself?
---
There are some epic items like this one that are Bind on Equip have an infinitesimally small chance to drop off of almost anything you kill that's high enough level. This one, [Warden Staff](https://classicdb.ch/?item=943)  and [Edgemasters](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14551) are probably the most sought after ones. Because the drop chance is so small on them and many people want them it's a bit like winning the WoW lottery
---
Melee damage has a higher rate of aggro gain I believe. I believe its something to 1-1 damage ratio for melee and .8-1 for ranged and spells.  I could easily be wrong about that too tho...
---
Who gives a shit. Some people only care about endgame.
---
Details damage meter.
---
 Titan Panel is a good add-on and very vanilla-friendly since it was one of the most popular add-ons back in the day.
---
I've never had a queue since launch night on Old Blanchy it's been wonderful.
---
I'm 18 and don't have the invisibility, and being undead with a  bunch of other undeads, I didn't spend my small amount of money on water breathing yet.
---
You don't care? Sure seems like it buddy. They aren't part of your classic experience sure but you don't have to be toxic towards em and miss the points they make.
---
Classic wow is much more fun to me imo. Although to my gf retail is much more fun. Try both.
---
How much gold this is worth?
---
You have 8 irl friends that play?! Damn I’m jealous. I’ve tried to convince like 3-4 friends that used to play to come back too, but everyone’s so busy since we’re all 30ish
---
Oh look, it's this thread again.
---
As far as I’ve noticed, heavy leather has been the place for me. However, that has already changed a bit the last few days. I went from selling in stacks of 2 for 15-20s to today where it’s about 11s for 2. I think now that more people are mid 30s that Thick Leather went down significantly. This means that you’ll have to bank on thick and rugged leather in the early 40s to max. Heavy Leather is still worth farming and I did grind two levels in the 30s for Heavy Leather and am sitting on 60g right now.
---
Waaaaht? NOOOOO.
---
Would love if they released B.C as I never got to play that in it’s prime. Hopefully not for awhile though.. it will take me a long time to get to 60 lmao
---
They listened 😍
---
How is it physical damage when the wands do nature damage, shadow damage, etc?
---
Don’t tell me how to take shots of my screen
---
You didn't have issues hitting 39+ mobs with Sunders and having them resist taunts at 35?
---
As one guy from the guild said, they have been running it every week on pserver about 200 times...
---
Looks like you've noticed you can buy linen for &lt;5s off the AH, make 3 bags (+.33) and just vendor them for 6s and make a profit.
---
Get paid to skill up. I did it too. AH is screwed up ATM because of the crazy lowbie competition on stuff, you can do the same with enchanting wands.
---
Are they seriously doing this without adding spanish servers???
---
Man...why cant people read things and not take them personally anymore. Just because he said to not stress about reaching 60 doesnt mean shit about all you sweaties. Just say, "oh he's not talking to me..." and move on.  Maybe theres some guilt about sweating on wow so hard that makes this post feel like he's personally vilifying you for doing so.
---
Do you accept donations?
---
Assuming the areas to farm aren’t incredibly overpopulated.
---
&gt; we're stuck playing Classic wanting the same changes we wanted back in Vanilla.
---
Ahh yes. The _true_ classic experience
---
I want to play druid, but if your not heals I was unsure of how good the dps is lvling and end game.  Especially cat form.
---
I'd be fine with just being able to login to BFA and tool around until my Classic queue popped.
---
 * Queue of an hour?  
---
Fine, I'll play BFA until then.
---
 * Queue pops?  
---
Now I choose to stay with BFA or switched to Classic.
---
Why not let me do that?
---
They will increase in price dramatically.
---
I think that you shouldn’t say that about blowing.
---
Stoned talon mountains
---
Mankirk's Barrens chat has been a hodgepodge of people debating if queer people exist, bullshit politics, Chuck Norris jokes, and replacing words in movie titles with Murloc. Really feels the same tbh
---
why do you go naked?
---
This would have been good a week ago when I was locked out of playing my level 10 because of ques and had to reroll and restarting my progress.
---
That’s a low level, but it took awhile to get there because of how packed the servers were at launch. First two days of playing were basically erased.
---
Heck no it's not too early. Cheap 1st respec. Look up any leveling guide with talents if you're not sure what to spec into. But anything is better for leveling than the full prot tree imo. I wouldn't put a single point into Prot while I'm leveling and I'll still tank all the way to 60. Dirty secret...alot of those priest healers are specced shadow to level =O
---
And that the drop rate is the same now as it will be when Phase 3 hits.  So all the people hording twink weapons until Phase 3 are going to have a flood of people trying to cash.  Which means it will probably be two years until twink weapons are selling for what people really want.
---
Went warrior first, remembered that while I love tanking, I hate being a tank, re-rolled a rogue. 
---
Two 20s are a bit quick for a 'no, seriously take it AS SLOW AS POSSIBLE to be cool', but I've had an otherwise slow week. 
---
I refuse to do optimal leveling builds though, and I'm sure deep subtlety will come in handy in world PvP and Improved Sap will be appreciated in dungeons.
---
Incendius?!
---
Minor inconvenience, but legitimate / simple request. At least you didn't grand stand it and claim moral superiority, it'd just be a nice bonus of a feature.
---
My guilds getting realm first mc, so i kinda have to race.
---
Almost every server has hours of queues during peak, even though we have like 10 times more servers now than 2 weeks before launch. How delusional do you have to be to think that this has been a failure in any way?
---
You just don't like classic, and that's fine. Retail is still around for you to play.
---
&gt;"25$ iS a LoT oF mOnEy"  
---
&gt; Jeezuz, they better focus on a better job and not WOW.
---
This is objectively bad. Sorry. :(
---
It's used in a quest in the badlands, everybody does the quest because the trinket reward is great.
---
Genny?
---
There were several "QoL" changes made in TBC:
---
Removal of the hunter dead zone.
---
Auto shot being "right click" for hunters
---
Hunter attack power change.
---
Consecrate being baseline for Paladins.
---
Overall more sensible talent trees.
---
Thrown weapons having durability instead of charges.
---
Hit and crit becoming a "rating"
---
Haste, armor pen and expertise becoming stats.
---
Tier drops being class tokens.
---
Resistance gear being MUCH less important 
---
Hell, bloodlust as a spell.
---
Etc etc. TBC wasn't just "classic 2.0" but it changed a lot upon it and in my mind improved it. We all have in our minds things that made later expansions worthwhile (RBGs for example), but every change will have its detractors.
---
Wands are not physical damage and suffer no pushback. All wands shoot with a school of magic (nature, shadow, frost, fire or holy), and thats why it can be resisted.
---
Def! I do when I group or someone really helps me, but I can't always chase someone down to give, lol
---
If you play with a group of friends and all level together I can see how that would be a blast.
---
But solo rush to 60? No fun
---
Lava run takes like 15 mins
---
No mention to Fordragon?
---
Guy literally burns to a dragon
---
I'm just grinding/farming to 60, but I'm also a mage...
---
Leave it to the alliance  to make shit homo
---
What what Inda butt?
---
Sounds like you have skinning.
---
Made me legit lol. Thank you sir.
---
same but vice-versa.... Who plays Alliance on a pvp server?!?! My dumb friends
---
If they released the ratio, the bigger faction would instantly become 70-80%, because people always like to play for the "winning" side.
---
gocha, ty.
---
Seriously though, Vanilla was never hard, and Classic is even easier.
---
This is why I don't shield tanks as a priest.
---
I let them get hit, so they can build rage.
---
Oh that reference tho!
---
I certainly don't want to tell people how to play the game. I would only caution people about burning themselves out on it.
---
hmm ok ty
---
No, ty though
---
What add on shows the text on the XP bar like that? I thought it was an option in retail to show the text of your XP progression, but couldn't find it, so I'm assuming it's from an addon.
---
Like Exiled is saying, you'll have a bar for each stance. There should be an option to setup paging on one of the bars, usually using bar 1, that will change based on stance. You basically have to mimic the Blizzard bar functionality with the add-on settings.
---
I find Demoralizing shout spam is enough AoE aggro to keep mobs off the healer. Now if only the dps could learn to single target dps skull for once instead of AoEing and pulling off me... ugh I hate dps.
---
Stealth and see you later boiiis
---
I've pretty much soloed myself to 43 as a warrior.
---
Life is hell
---
"oh no my 20 silver for repairs"
---
You are telling people what to do, no?
---
how'd you know lmao
---
No minion warlock will be an interesting one.
---
Wow was a social experiment as well as a gaming experience. The shitter trolls now opposed to 15 years ago are a dime a dozen. They're louder and ignorant. Back in the day most trolls were just waste your time, or racist/sex jokes that, let's be honest, were sometime pretty funny. It wasnt harmful or "targeted"
---
Level 9 and loving the slow ride bb
---
Not gonna lie, I'd be butthurt to lose a name I care about.
---
This is true at 60, but really not the case at low levels. Aside from potions, tanks don't really have that much say in whether or not they stay alive (and druids can't even use potions in form).  
---
As a warrior, you don't have last stand and shield block is pretty inefficient only blocking 1 attack. So basically, you have shield wall on a 30 min CD as your "oh shit". 
---
I'm not disagreeing with your overall points regarding threat or that 50% health is generally fine, but tanks don't have all that much control over whether they live or die at low levels.
---
&gt; Only the one guy who took off work lost progress though as the rest of us I don’t think ever even made it in.
---
My party was similar. I logged in on the dot and didnt sit in a queue. 3 other members of my party logged in 5-15 minutes later and they all sat in 3+hour queues and didn't get a chance to play at all.
---
I'm honestly seeing more Shamans/Mages than anything.
---
Very few rogues/hunters/druids.
---
Warriors/Priests/Paladins are relatively common.
---
Warlocks feel about right.
---
Dude. The fact that he’s 60 right now is evidence enough. 
---
Take your, “ you can’t prove” bullshit and shove it. 
---
Fuck off with your liberal Millenial catchwords.
---
Time-lock servers have a precedent for dripping content up to the current version of the game. We will just have to wait and see what happens. Blizzard didn't think they were going to make WoW classic at all, so they are just flying by the seat of their pants.
---
well to be fair i am 31 and i sometimes wish i could do that to some people on the street its funny because the way i see it when you get on the internet i feel like you are automatically opening yourself up for anyone to randomly come up and talk to you.
---
There is always one that needs the dual screen at the LAN party
---
This is real autism
---
Harassing verbally then yeah, perma ganked well PVE server do exist.
---
Names with mergers. It’s why they stopped doing them and grouped them.
---
PvP is where it shines - Warlocks can be really bad at chasing down some classes or kiting away from them. It helps a bit, especially if it's improved.
---
No, they opened up more normal EST server.  I thought Mankrik was west coast though?
---
It sounds like the idea is so people from high/full realm pops can move to less populated to avoid queues.
---
Oh lol, thanks for pointing that out. I must have been hearing too much of queues with Classic to make the mistake lol.
---
I say try both out, you get them both with the same sub so why not. In terms of "no lifer," classic wow is much more time consuming overall compared to the current main retail version. Over the years the grind has been lessened quite a bit compared to when it first came out, and with classic it goes right back to that, so retail may be more to your liking.
---
Have you got a good wand? That's what it boils down to imo.
---
I send in void, CoA, corruption and immolate. Target another, shadowbolt, corruption, dear, immolate, wand until dead, wand voudwalkers target til dead. Life tap a bit etc. Make sure you have first aid for less downtime.
---
Check our Kargoz on YouTube, he's got three videos on warlocks, ignore the first one and watch 2 &amp; 3.
---
I saw Tosspot on a EU server the other day, wonder how far that plucky dwarf lasted
---
Its useful to kite certain elite mobs, but I think a lot of people skip it now.
---
From all, what’s the importance of reaching level 60?
---
Then again eso was the inlu mmorpg game i have ever played period. So i dont know but i have seen some videos on people raiding and talking with each other which seems fun
---
Its asking to join a private channel, not a guild. I am in a guild.
---
According to this subreddit, you should go dungeon cleave your way to 60 and never step outside into the world once.
---
It is. Lots don't want to leave, assuming any who do, "aren't horde core" or are tourists not willing to put up with a queue.  
---
If they had seen the writing on the wall, and made more servers with the wave of Name Regs, would have been the only way.
---
Was world chat ever a retail thing?  I know private servers promoted and sometimes required joining it.
---
If you are using the twitch app, install your classic addons manually, otherwise it will choose the retail version. You can use twitch to update, but for installation it’s a bit buggy.
---
I’ve been using threat plates for classic and it works great.  Also make certain you are grabbing the “classic”  version for the addons version while installing manually.
---
Sounds like a PEBKAC error
---
Should just look up videos on youtube or google guides. Tanking takes practice and you can be given poor advice. Things to keep in mind: lvling a warrior is annoying, you should have at least 2h weapons mapped out on your journey to 60. There are videos on this already, you can likely find them on youtube. Another thing is you can lvl fury or arms and still tank dungeons on your way to 60, just keep a 1h and shield in your bags (sometimes i even tank with 2h and top the meters with that sweet sweet rage). Sunder armor spam isnt your only threat generator, demo shout and battle shout both generate great threat, instead of bloodrage bshout pre pull, do that after you pull with range wep and youll have some threat on all targets. You should get some form of nameplate addon so you can see when  you lose aggro and can snap taunt.

Skin everything you find, then vender the skins

at level 51 I get Irritable Bowel Syndrome? Maybe I should stop playing my Warrior now...

Oh, now *I'm* laughing! That's a good one!

Just invest a gold and get the level 26 blue boe staff with stam and spirit.

If the name belongs to an in-game NPC you cannot have it. Not sure if this is the case but it is highly likely

Okay thanks! So I guess WC needs to be done without wiping then otherwise you’re screwed 😅

WoW paragon levels

Hey! Didn't realise I had done that. Maybe I am. Maybe not. Who knows?
---
And I'm sitting here on 8g at level 25 and playing paladin.
---
Must have been. Wasn't my intention. I thought I was making an innocuous anecdote.....
---
I was a level 31 paladin, just got done with a few dungeon runs so I was decked out in gear.
---
Was running through Dustwallow March when a 37 troll mage targeted me and started casting a frostbolt, the fool.
---
Had Hand of Freedom up as often as possible and used all of my utility spells so it was basically impossible for him to get me down.
---
The fight lasted several minutes and I triumphed in the end, I /saluted and went on my way, hoping to have more epic fights in the future since this made me really hyped for the honor system amd world pvp!
---
Method doesn't start at level 1 every time a new raid comes out. They also don't bring people below the level cap and they're not all in greens.
---
If you're claiming that they're messaging you through battle.net after deleting them from your friends list, they literally can't. They could maybe message you character to character in-game but that's it, and you can easily ignore individual characters if that's the case. Above all else though, report them.

Battle shout threat depends on how many party members receive the buff, so if you are just buffing yourself that might be the case.

I too miss the days when we could make jokes about sensitive topics and people would actually laugh and find it disarming instead of squirming on the stick which is so deep up their ass that a paladin would be jealous.
---
Thank you so much!
---
&gt; Does it play any diffrent in wow classic/retail game.
---
It's mostly the same, the big difference is that now everyone knows pretty much everything and there's entire databases dedicated to WoW.
---
So a lot of the 'fresh' experience and finding out new things is gone, but for new players this will still be there.
---
&gt;How diffrent is pvp in wow classic and in retail ,if there is any difference then which do you perfer more
---
I only played retail until TBC, so my answer isn't going to be the best.
---
Right now PvP is just like it was leveling up, you get annihilated by players higher level than you, while you absolutely smash anyone a lower level than you. I think it's going to be a while until ClassicWoW PvP is going to become huge because most people are focused on leveling at the moment, and most of the PvP happens at level 60.
---
Haha I gotta say, at first I thought this post was gonna be about two of the best looking class tier sets (Bloodfang for Rogue and Judgment for Paladin).
---
But if you are only lvl 12 and feel like switching, it can't hurt. A small pop server will probably make it easier to make friends, because people will remember each other more easily.
---
This game is about making a couple close friends and kicking some ass together. For the long haul. So a small server can be great if you don't mind spending some more time messaging people to join dungeon runs, elite quests, etc.
---
It's all about the pace of ganeplay that you're looking for. High pop = faster, low pop = more relaxed.
---
Oh! My apologies! I've never seen that before lol goodluck!
---
&gt;If they are able to do that how do you think a regular guild that are max level and has geared for quite some time are gonna do?
---
Poorly. Garr will break guilds. Phase 1 content isn't about pushing numbers. Phase 1 is about working out each fight and getting 40 people to work as a unit. Which APES has been doing for years.
---
It's still fine for dungeon aoe imo, since the tank can just grab the "lucky" mobs that don't get frozen. But yeah, not for the solo gimmicky stuff.
---
Yesterday, my friend's baby banged on her keyboard while she was playing and somehow she got stuck in moonwalk mode.  She had to log out and log back in to fix it.

I use Threat Plates and really like it. Give that a try.

What's his name so I can avoid him?

Were you party lead? Kick him and get a new dps from your guild

hit 40 on mage and got the mount of a loan. STV has been surprisingly friendly, all other areas is hardcore pvp zone xD

Im team Bubtle!

"Didn't know about 10 manning dungeons".  I don't believe you could even enter a dungeon in Vanilla with more than five people. I seem to recall an error message if you tried to enter a 5 man dungeon with anything more than five players. I might be mis-remembering that but  I don't know of anyone who even tried that back in the day.  
---
People did try exploits but I don't know if that particular one was even possible.
---
Not sure about hate but a lot of people are disappointed with Asmon. He said he would NOT accept gold at all until he himself grinded the epic mount. 
---
He got lvl 40 and accepted viewers gold for the mount. 
---
So people are disappointed at him going back on his word. And I get it too. He keeps saying how he wants the classic experience yet hes been skipping almost every zone just farming in instances and now accepting gold from viewers. 
---
Thats just my take on it. But I am EU so Idc too much.
---
This is what I've done as druid and as an added bonus the macro automatically uses the max rank available unless you specify a rank so no need to worry about swapping skills when you train new ones.
---
Yeah I imagine it'll only give you the option of other low pop PvP servers that are EST if you were to move off Herod. I hope people actually take it because I'm currently fine with playing on Herod right now. Queues have been getting better and I'm sure they will continue to get better.
---
Instead of pointing your potato at the screen, please try to check if the "Print Screen" button on your keyboard is functioning first

gdit it...i honestly did see this coming though :)
---
I levelled 1-60 in vanilla exactly once. it took me months and I was learning as I went along. While Classic WoW is a new experience, -- I'm mmuch smarter about hwo to level and how to make money while doing it.
---
Chosen one...
---
because a low pop realm has room for more players than currently play on it, which means the new community ends up being larger than the old community, and completely take over the server.  that's an invasion.
---
It would make sense if they weren't trying to constantly throw Classic under the bus in favor of retail.
---
My group was screen sharing on discord. Every time I looked over our warrior was dead xD

27 shaman. Leveling with the boys so we hamper ourselves to not ding too far from eachother. I’ve gotten an alt to 21 also, who I use to farm skins for the shammys LW. I’m counting on 34-40 this week.
---
Steel toes count?
---
My plan was to get 250g from 35 to 40 grinding swamp jaguars but looks like blizzard nerfed/changed the droprates or the private server had them from the beginning.
---
After a certain time, mobs respawn, but bosses shouldn’t.
---
Also, you shouldn’t be in WC that long for a single run.
---
Y’all will spend most of that at level 30 training don’t worry. It will come back quick tho

There is only one shaman name: Oprahwinfury

Every poll I've seen indicates that Mograine should be one of the more balanced servers but goddamn do I ever feel like I'm drowning under a weight of Alliance.  
---
This mornings session I decided to finally keep an actual tally when questing in Alterac Mountains after spending time in numerous zones I just assumed were closer to major alliance hubs.  The wiki indicates that Alterac Mountains should be a neutral zone with Tarren Mill actually closer than Southshore so maybe a slight Horde bias.  My count came to 14 Alliance vs 3 Horde before I stopped counting.

If you played 40 hours of Wow back in the day most of that was surely spent leveling in classic zones.  So if you want that but without streamlined questing and an overall poorer server economy then go for it.  But depends why you quit the first time and what you think you'll get out of it now.
---
Shift and scroll cycles through the bars, iirc.
---
It doesn't seem like OP is just dragging along another character to suck up loot, he is effectively playing both roles.
---
Priest has a lot of down time for mana, and cast time. It works perfect to alt-tab between windows, toss heals and maintain prot. warrior  rotation especially at low levels when neither class has a lot of abilities
---
Dualboxing actually keeps you even more engaged. I dualboxed a warrior/priest alts through late Wrath normal dungeons.
---
No offense, you are allowed your opinion, but if feels like you don't understand what someone properly dualboxing looks like.
---
Yes. Especially if you get a competent group. And youll get great gear. Win win.
---
Too bad fury tanks better for the first half of the game since prot does nothing for your rage issues.
---
thats what i used to play back in vanilla. i miss my tauren hunter. im hoping my warrior pays off well, cause the investment is taxing.
---
fucking hell running at -50 speed while dead ALL the way across the map, because i some how pulled the only caster in a mile and hes behind a tree.

Hang in there, we're gonna be needed in the endgame content!

Warriors scale the hardest of any class in the game. They start really weak,  and become gods at 60 with good gear
---
 It maybe I am partially equipped to explain  this “edgelords” comment to you.     
---
About 120 years ago, the was a situation in my local area, where a conflict between an indigenous tribe and the Anglo townfolk escalated and resulted in the near complete annihilation of both side in a horrifying bloodbath.   
---
This event holds a dark place in the soul of this area and its effects are still obvious.    
---
This obviously pales in comparison to the Jewish Holocaust” in both scale and evil.    
---
My point is that this event is referred to as “The Fury”.     
---
If we take away a word every time a specific use of it might offend a group of people, then it would not be long before our language would be hobbled beyond and ability to be expressive.

No. If you're not doing the big pull aoe thing, frostbite and shatter are fantastic.

I play on Herod and will continue to play on Herod, even with high queues. I just start it up and wait a few hours, playing later in the evening than maybe I intended. 
---
Contrary to some other opinions here, I absolutely love playing on really high pop servers. Going to new towns and hanging out in the city while LOTS of people are around is the best. Same with battlegrounds/pvp when I’m in the mood. High Pop for me is where it’s at.
---
Since I belong to the superior faction, I would kill the filthy alliance ofc

Ah we were in luck then. It was a US server.

Thanks for the tip, just tried it, doesn't work. What am I doing wong?

Should have just grinder it out man was in same boat. Grinder it out fast now I’m a proper meat blender. I also didn’t run but two armourys no ravager and no desire to farm dungeons would rather quest myself.
---
You pvp =&gt; sword spec
---
Everyone is forgetting this is all in preparation for when layering goes away completely. All of the "low pop" servers are still layered at least 2-3 times. They already said that these lower pop servers have a much higher population than even the biggest servers back in Vanilla so no, there are not going to be any "dead" servers.
---
You might be correct. The 14slot bags drop occasionally from 39-60. but the 16slot traveler bags are pretty low drop rate. However you would be the most likely to be able to get 4 + x for your bank.
---
The order in which you level your professions will be a big decision since you cant level them all up.
---
I was thinking of a new mode of wow that had No trading or auction house but let you use all proffesions. That would be sick.
---
You will probably want a nice huge bank to stockpile mats for other professions.
---
Seems to me you should handle it the same way as other unpopular arrangements, like reserving an item.  You mention it while recruiting people for a group, and if they don't like the concept they don't have to join.  
---
Personally, I would be a lot more annoyed to find out someone is botting partway through a dungeon than before starting.  It's reasonable to assume everyone is playing a single character in a dungeon group, and not bringing it up ahead of time is kinda dishonest.
---
Also, while you can argue that both characters deserve a roll because they're both contributing, you can also argue that it makes it easier for you to win rolls on items (you control two fifths of the rolls, while everyone else controls one fifth.  If someone thinks the loot system is rigged (and not negotiated ahead of time), of course they're going to get salty.

I use IceHUD for my energy ticker. Applies the heartbeat right on top of the energy bar. Also has weapon swing timers for MH and OH, buff duration tracking, CC timers and bar color changes at different percentages. All very easy to configure with a full menu (so not just slash commands)

Everything works with ElvUi exept the name plates... I'm goin' nuts.
---
For sure, molten core is like a 360 at best.
---
Just know that you're going to be the guy who cant afford his mount at 40 and will still have to run everywhere on foot. Selling items for coin is part of the game and asking double vendor isnt absurd.
---
Flight path
---
That's fucking stupid and you know it. Again, what makes this an "invasion"? What exactly do you have against people from other servers? They're not "sniping raid members" or "corpse camping the old community with their epics". There's probably less than a hundred people out of million so far that have even made it to 60, let alone have done a raid and attained any epics so far. You're just making up hypothetical situations that sound bad to try to drum up fear. Again, you sound exactly like Fox News right now.
---
Works with ElvUI.
---
Very good points, and ive seen the same.  Some people are like "OHH YOU BARELY MISSED BEING A MILLENIAL BY 1 YEAR" and im thinking like wtf are you talking about, you are 2 gens off
---
It tilts people to get killed by people who look stupid and have even dumber names. Bonus points if the game displays avatars, so you can select a smug anime girl to stare at them when they die.
---
For games without PVP I select names from dead languages. For games with PVP I have a list of terrible names that I pull from.

"Just auto attack for a couple seconds" (proceeds to unload on target)
---
What are world drops? From rare spawns?
---
You can help yourself to grinding out a 4 hour quest...
---
You’ll want to get staves at least since you’ll get some nice ones with good stats. Could also pick up a nice offhand and want to pair it with a dagger or sword. As far as leveling the skill, that’s not very important but it’s pretty quick regardless. Just go fight some lower level stuff with your void tanking and swing your weapon at it.
---
D2 servers have been very "dead" for years.

Fury is better for levelling pre40 if you're okay with paying to respec for MS at 40

Ok cool, thank you very much!

Blacksmiths lose something to open it.  Does the guy opening the armory door, the ubrs door or the strathholme gate get all the loot inside if no one else can open it?
---
And if no one else is on I can catch up on a season of some show.
---
Warriors are all about the struggle. Not everyone is going to make it to cap but those that do will be ahead of the pack.
---
Because of how a warrior functions you need to keep your gear current...that might mean getting blacksmithing up and farming a bit for ore or running a dungeon a few times for gear. Do what you need to do to make sure your gear is not in shambles, your weapon bring the most important piece.
---
You’ll notice that you’ll still struggle, but it gets easier and easier if you keep pushing. Glad to see another warrior in the trenches.
---
I keep getting the opposite where my character will use his quiver as a melee weapon.
---
That makes sense. Thanks!
---
I use it personally when I'm trying to get into range of a mobile class.  If someone tries to attack me then dip I'll toss CoE on them at which point my slow ass can catch up and get my other dots on them.  In PvP I only use CoA if theyre staying in range or nearly dead and I just want to have something rolling to finish them off.
---
Thank you, this is exactly what my problem was.
---
Hooked on phonics can help with that reading comprehension.
---
Not sure what you mean by tanking but it also shows the healing your healers do
---
We've already told you what's different but you're refusing to listen because it doesn't go along with the narrative you'd already convinced yourself of. The stuff you're claiming will happen literally can't because 99.9% of players aren't even doing any raids yet. Hell, most of them aren't even above level 30 yet, and it's basically guaranteed that almost nobody who will use the free transfers will even be above that yet either. And even if they are, there's still currently so many people playing that you haven't had any contact whatsoever with most of the people on your server, you'll never know the difference.
---
So instead, maybe try embracing the new community members if people transfer to your server. Why be hostile about it to random people who are just looking for a better server to play on?
---
is it possible?  yes.
---
is it worthwhile?  probably not.
---
My thoughts exactly. Never saw one in the wild (outside of work) for years
---
Oh, thats cool, I did not know that.

Thats the part that doesn't make sense. My warrior has costs in repairs, upgrades, flight paths, mounts, just as much as the priest does. I don't think about it as one person getting 2 chances out of 5. I think about it as 2 characters trying to survive in a harsh world that is centered around gold. If they're both doing their job, there is 0 difference between it being one player or two. The two characters are in the dungeon, doing the work.

i think you are missing the point. classic promotes and activily incites this type of behavior. BFA does not so while in theory it can be done the same it wont be because no1 has a reason to. most people arent activily trying to be nice all the time unless incentivced as cynical as that may sound. classic is simply better with others and it helps to have friends so it promotes this type of behavior. In BFA you can, for the most part, play the game entirely alone including raiding through either pugs or LFR
---
What are you rambling about? Most people do not like playing poorly or imperfectly. Most people actually enjoy doing respectable dps and contributing to a fight.  If you take 15 or 30 minutes to google how to properly play a rogue in vanilla/classic raiding and use one of the small handful of acceptable specs - you will always, easily, outperform a vanilla druid trying their hardest. It's not rocket science and there's years of data to back this up.
---
I'll be doing the run from Crossroads to Stonetalon to Desolace to get a tailoring pattern and the book that takes your cooking past 150. I'm really looking forward to it, no sarcasm. It's going to be and adventure. I thought about going the Thousand Needles, Feralas, Desolace route, but at lvl 23 that seemed a bit too dangerous.
---
It's impossible to avoid respeccing as a Warrior. At 60, you have to change your spec every time you get a new weapon. 
---
Dread it. Run from it. That 50g respec cap still arrives.
---
It's a weird debate. Mechnically there is nothing hard about classic imo. BfA trash mobs have more mechanics than most raid bosses, and rotation for some casters consist of spamming 1 skill and wanding. Yet I wouldn't call it easy mostly due to the heavy emphasis on resource management (mana, cooldowns, etc) and the lack of AoE/control options for most classes.

Oh you didn't want to spend money on it? So I guess you don't want us to down this boss? That's cool, that's cool.. why are you wearing that low level item? Ah, because it looks cool? I see, that makes sense. How the hell did you get feared into the whelps? Did you not read the tactics? No? Ok great.

It just depends on the warriors gear and level compared to the dungeon.   Prot doesnt get an awful lot to make them b tree tanks through most of the leveling process.   If we are the right level for a dungeon or slightly high I can be healed with just renew unless we do a big pull.
---
Yeah, I know. WhenI first started in WoW during WorLK I could get 5 gold for a stack of copper ore. It’s just the fact that so many players are at low level right now, there’s an over-supply of the mats and minimal demand.

So funny, I made a WC group last night because no one would invite me - was a 17 rogue. I got sick of no one inviting me to their group so I made my own. Got a healer and 1 DPS through their posts then I posted lfm 1 dps and 1 tank and got a dps, then no one whispered me seeking to tank so I started randomly whispering all the warriors in the zone. I would have moved on to druids next if if I hadn't gotten one.

I haven't done that since the middle of BC and it was amazing.  I used to raid lead on a super dead server and 90% of my time was spent recruiting. It is not enjoyable to desperately try to fill the last few spots of a raid while 17 people are waiting on you. It's not quite enough to say fuck it run with open spots, and the pressure to get enough people before anyone left was intense. Burned me out eventually, but it felt amazing when it all came together and the raid group I put together and led actually killed all the bosses. It was fun to do again though with super low stakes. Definitely brought back memories. 
---
Anyway, a warrior whispered me asking to dps and I asked if he was up for tanking instead and he said yes. It was a great (though very long) run with no wipes or deaths.  I'm betting that won't be the last time I need to put a group together in order to run a dungeon.
---
XP disabling wasn't a thing until much later versions. I cannot say for sure.
---
What do you mean by PvP guy?
---
i stopped playing, but i respect blizzard for this
---
This guy gets it, 100%.

I know shitting on retail is pretty played out, but I bet you never felt that excited in \*years\* to get a gear drop on retail
---
Day 1: Sat in queue on Whitemane for 4 hours before giving up and going to bed.
---
Day 2: Say in queue on Whitemane for an hour before saying "F it" and rolling on a new server.
---
Day 3 - now: Got a level 36 human rogue. Loving it, and better time spent than sitting in queue to play.
---
There was a plethora of posts and long winded comments shitting on blizzard and saying the sky was falling.

I just wanted to point out how accurate this is.  I'll be rolling around on my Lock and because I'm human I have perception and will see them always lurking around lol.

Lol OP is 15.

Pretty sure BNET already does this. They implemented this feature within the last or current expac of WoW. It should be called clubs or social groups.
---
Borderlands 3 soon, and I think the Halo remaster is here or it is still just soon for the PC version?
---
that is highly subjective. Arms is more consistent reliable damage, while fury is more dps but you miss alot. Also as fury you take more damage on average, having to spend more downtime eating/bandaging. I only recommend arms because it is much easier for new warriors.
---
And you yourself only having woolen bags during this? Have you ever heard the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
---
To be fair if you played from launch your server has queue's. I switched to a server released a few hours before launch and we have a queue everyday.
---
I did this when I was lvl 8. Only died 4 or 5x in barrens. wasnt bad.
---
It can be pretty rough being a person who worships a subterranean lizard god in an MMO so I am pretty used to toxicity, but classic feels different
---
I mean, it's not hard.
---
123, alt-tab to pornhub. Tab back in to hit 3 again every 30secs.
---
Just mention to need them it’s all RNG.
---
Even more so! To my surprise I now enjoy questing more than anything else whereas on retail I would stay as far away from them as possible and dungeon-grind my way to max level. I guess I really missed exploring/adventuring in an open world.
---
One is toxic low-effort, one is a healthy low-effort COMMUNITY meme!

Yeah I don't get this... I'm at level 30 and rl gender hasn't even remotely come up once in hundreds of chats I've had with people... It seems like it's something that would only come up if you brought it up.
---
details works for me. overall data updates after fights not in real time (unless theres a setting i missed) but other than that its great
---
I'm so addicted that I quit my heroin addiction to play WoW more.
---
Went from Orc/Lock to Gnome/Lock - Big change for me to play alliance and so far I am enjoying it.
---
The leveling abuse.
---
Saaàaaaaame
---
Whats the name of the ghost cat?
---
I care. It was a fun race to watch between apes, progress and onslaught. I'm also tired of people on reddit constantly telling me that the way I enjoy the game is wrong, that the only way to enjoy it is to play at a snail's pace.
---
yeah details seems to be working fine just for me granted it does take some getting used too and figuring out but if you use dps meter from bfa you should be able to figure this out.
---
Congrats nerd.
---
No, but he's still gonna get angry about it!
---
It's a terrorist recruiting tool.
---
If you are on a low pop server can you swap off that server to take the name on a 2nd character then swap the original character back to get a new name?
---
Battlegrounds will use battlegroups. Blues have confirmed.

As Horde, that’s actually the one capital raid I did in vanilla. Good times.

Is there any chance for a settings command?
---
/ThreatPlates and /Tp doesn't seem to do anything for me.
---
I was thinking about that too. Idk what percentage of the people playing WoW Classic are from the pservers, but anyone who is has been doing this content nonstop. Imagine if before Blizz launched a raid, a full year earlier it was scripted almost perfectly for some guild to farm. You can bet your ass it'd be cleared pretty quick when it gets launched.
---
Just started yesterday, level 9! Lol
---
"Day 23 - 
---
   I didn't have to kill that mage, but on the weekend he stole a chest from me after I cleared the mobs around it.
---
   I only regret that the mage released before bore witness to the tea bagging his corpse got after I ate it."
---
I think it was even bis in wotlk until power shifting was nerfed (early)
---
I think you hit the nail on the head with "i can do things other people can't." We encounter a lot of obstacles in both legion and in classic but in legion most classes have a way to do almost all of them but they are cosmetically different. In classic, none of us have even half the tools to solve our problems making the ones that we do have feel more special. When we mix with other people who have different tools we appreciate them more since we could never do that on our own. I play a warlock, I can't buff, I can't heal, I can't give food or water, but - I can give health stones to the whole party, I can summon missing party members, and I can soulstone the healer or tank in a pinch. Those moments where my unique tools are utilized feel amazing. I love watching my tanks when the healer goes oom and they pop my improved health stone to make it through the last bit of an encounter. Or when someone needs a repair and everyone groans only to realize we have a warlock so this will take no time at all.
---
Well I played for years as a "free loader" and only ran to 20 in the trials and then once I finally bought my first subscription Cata was out and I got really into Twinks. So if I come back I was just wondering if the guy in Org who could disable Exp was there or not. I could have sworn he was PvP related, but honestly I don't remember.
---
Forget the haters in the comments, bonebiter is the superior axe, with minimal time investment, plus you can get some sweet shoulders in the process.
---
Getting a group of people to unanimously decide to reroll is more difficult if there are more people in the group.
---
How is this even a little difficult for you to understand?
---
I'm the opposite.
---
Everyone has been saying how hard warriors are.
---
I rolled my druid to 27 and am now maiming my warrior who is 15. Its just so much fun. I hit SO damn hard.
---
I die a lot easier yes. No warstomp then heal/rejuv back to bear form.
---
But it's just so satisfying swinging that big 2h.
---
Farming creeps is so much faster if you go 1 at a time than it was on my druid.
---
If you play smart it doesnt seem so bad.
---
But again. Level 15.
---
I'll die shit tonnes more I'm sure.
---
You can also go the other way across the mountain.
---
You should have left them right in the middle of the dungeon and hearthed out. *You're* the tank. *You* have the power in that situation.
---
And if you're gonna get hurt because a hunter sniped your loot, you should know that's happened to literally *everyone* at one point or another, even other hunters.
---
Someone stole my name, on literally every server. RIP me.
---
I feel like this would split the playerbase way to thin to make it viable though.
---
If I have an alliance character, could I delete it and then move my horde character to that server, or have I chosen alliance for that server forever?
---
Not really sure what you mean. These people COULD be out in the world exploring, questing, crafting etc, but you can play however you want. Socializing is a big part of the game since some quests are really difficult, and you need to find groups for dungeons and raids. I guess these guys just wanted to take a break from everything and just chat.
---
Why did you take a picture on your phone when you could have uploaded a screenshot.
---
Those 15 minute spawn timers, gotta love it
---
Yep, and in the cases I know, being good at numbers sure as hell doesn't hurt your skill at a game that's  just numbers with a VERY fancy GUI.
---
I dont think you are a bad person but I think you have a bad understanding of human psychology and socializing. We are social creatures BUT its not selfless. Most people will only socialize to fulfill their own needs when they actually think they are being nice when subconsciously it makes them feel good and this is why they do it. You have an unrealistic and idealistic view of the issue and it will never occur at a mass scale in wow or anything else that does not incentivise social interaction
---
Havoc DH which is one of the easiest class in the game has a 3 spells ST rotation and 5 in AOE/cleave iirc, and it should be the most bare bones class kit in the game.
---
Just checking if it's straight.
---
Lmao, you think there wouldn't be a shit storm if everyone lost their "only a day or two" of progress? Pretty obvious you don't have a job and your time has very low value if this is the case.
---
After that they made a blue post on the classic wow fourms that they dont know when.
---
Can you post your talents?
---
Hit 29 on my holy priest.  Just got those awesome blue shoulders from that big chain quest in Duskwood 💪
---
We have a guild called &lt; It Won't Suck Itself &gt; on Westfall
---
I was after the lesser stone elementals in badlands. Some lock comes by and dots up 4 of the 5 mobs that I was obviously working on. After I kill my one I turn around and see him running at low hp. I walked up and just stared at him while he sacced his pet and feared for his life. I started helping him to finish them off cuz I'm not an ass, but when I got it down to the last mob I let it kill him before I finished it off, cuz I'm an ass.
---
Yup but what i mean is that they just cant keep re releasing these old games it would look silly as hell
---
Uhm, no it's very correct.
---
I've been doing that too, should've specified that's mostly pre-30 but I feel like that'd kill the joke
---
My career has really taken off over the last couple of years. I work in IT.
---
It clearly bothers you a lot. I can see through the bullshit. Why would you even care to type all of this if you did not care? I dont see how any person could care about what some other guy gets in hes mailbox in a game. Like you said its just a game who cares... Yea then why the hell do you care so much?
---
Rather salty for sure.
---
They probably don't care because they can just get in queue hours before they start their stream since they don't have jobs other than streaming
---
I would do that for my husband, except that he'd come home with his desk redesigned for a lefty and all of his spells placed with a mouse-clicker in mind...
---
Free transfers have already been announced for high pop servers, so ppl migrating from those servers will probably raise the population of the new servers besides Blizzard have already mentioned that server that have a medium population are already larger than high population Vanilla servers were in 2006
---
They weren't mostly in greens if you watched a single stream of the kill.
---
I believe he meant "pvp guy" as in the guy who allows you to turn off xp gain(atleast from bg's), who I believe was added later on(as you stated).
---
That's when we move. Not now.
---
Yesterday I spent like 3 hours leveling fishing, cooking and herb/alchemy.  It was relaxing and I felt really good about my character's progress afterwards.  Don't neglect your professions!
---
Thanks! I never really got into dungeons and instance content as a kid because it was all so overwhelming and I was a bad player but now that I'm getting into it with Classic, well, it's still pretty hectic but I like it a lot!
---
The longer us guys that know how to spank with Prot can stay an enigma, the longer those paladins will lie incredulous on the ground before releasing. 
---
I'll happily remain vague on method, and overt on results.
---
Don’t forget sharptalon in ashenvale. Don’t mind the 31 mob patting through a level 19 quest area.
---
Huh??
---
Wholesome community killing time
---
Did you read my comment correctly? If you did something like that, then you're an ass. I know you didn't do that, I was referring to the asshole.
---
I am thinking of rolling a Shaman.
---
Will I be forced into healing in PvE situations? I really dislike healing, but I played a Shaman for years in retail so I am partial to the class and want to DPS.
---
Yup
---
I say try classic.  Just try to get a good guild so you have people to play with.  
---
Leveling is pretty garbage in BFA until later levels.   It is much faster, and easier through.
---
Awesome post, I was shielding and pre-renewing my tank yesterday... luckily we had no problems but this is a great tip.
---
It has tusks. At my height, those are the same as swords!
---
&gt;I’d love to be on a different server but I’d rather play with my friends than be alone unfortunately.
---
How exactly are you going to play with your friends when you're all in queue lol?
---
Funny thing, I can level from 1 to 50 in 2 days in EQ, wow is so much slower leveling lol.
---
I'm not racing bc I can't afford the monthly dues and don't have anyone to play with! Upvote!
---
Is this a Netherwind joke that I'm too Herod to understand?
---
There’s a frostitute still alive and well in the barrens on my server.
---
Are they beasts like wolves?
---
Humanoids should almost always drop some copper/silver.
---
Add me too! Casual but just want some peeps to play with
---
+1 for Details. Seems to be the popular choice.
---
What’s the general consensus for how marks are used? Skull means the mob you wanna pull? What about the others? First time tanking in WoW.
---
hell yes I got the name zaros on sulfuras the same server as OP
---
Gotta make it political? Maybe that is why it is ‘rough’ for you.
---
Your own toxicity.

This!  Got a wand and frost nova'd.  Didn't need to drink as often.
---
I had no idea that I could manually skin. I have wasted so many skins when I was duoing :/
---
I agree man.  I am taking my time but also I cannot be a no lifer at this game because I have a career, fiance to spend time with, friends, and family.  I am only level 20 and I been playing since launch and I can only play 4 evenings a week. I think I am doing fine :) I'm enjoying the slow grind for the experience!
---
Being poor while leveling is not a unique experience.  Buy the skills you use hold off on the ones you don't.  Mount is a luxury and won't kill you if you get it later.  And nice though it is to have money you can in most cases get by without.
---
You can literally just unlock the default frames and move them. You can also turn them to raid style frames that look similar to many adding, all built in to default UI
---
There's a backstab leveling build that uses the front stab game mechanic that's pretty good.
---
FUCK YOU. I have 4g. 
---
*cries because poor*
---
But... Me am not that kind of orc!
---
It's not going to help as much as people think. If your 40 person guild didn't want to leave before they still won't. If someone is terrified of being on a dead server and sticks to the busiest they won't. If the queues come down enough some people will probably go back to the server.
---
It might not be 10k queues but I bet it's still like 5k queues. The biggest help will be people actually logging off when not playing and no longer 24 hour a day power leveling.

Idk what everyone is complaining about. Im able to go 1v1 against 6 enemies before i need to break. And since i have a good amount of spirit, my breaks dont even require food. Just 10-20 seconds standing around which i can use to plan my next few kills. 
---
I have prob eaten 10-15 foods of varies level between level 1 to 25.
---
It would be interesting to see some of classic's original renditions of content that wouldnt come out until future expansions due to engine or time limitations. Vanilla's outland and emerald dream to name a couple, and I believe something to do with Azshara(spelling?) and the caverns of time.
---
why vendor skins instead of ah
---
Xp off NPC is a WotLK addition so no
---
Just try it once dude
---
HIS BASE
---
I did it on a pserver with 4 other warriors. It takes longer because you have to share but we would rotate in packs of 2 and 3 killing elementals. The cyclonian I would probably just pay 1g for a higher level to help. The weapon you replace with ww axe should easily vendor for 1g
---
Mobs don’t always drop loot.
---
Play the real vanilla experience and use Thottbot instead
---
It was a joke. That said, Aslong as you use def stance, actual tanking gear (stam) and a 1h/shield you should be ok. Try to tank in 2h and agi gear won't go well...
---
I never understood why Darnassus even exists. People only go there for mounts and weapon training, and that's it. It's just too far away from everything else Alliance related, so nobody wants to socialize there.
---
What's preventing you from doing ony pre 60? Because it's sure as hell not the game.
---
He's right.
---
How did you expect to take decent screenshots or adequately assess the graphics when you were running it on a toaster with 20 fps.
---
Part of classic is being able to appreciate just how amazing the art is considering the technological limitations of 2004.
---
Looking at something made 15 years ago and simply stating "its not as good as what people today can make" is a pretty low iq move friend.

Do you go to a cathedral and think "yeah i guess its alright but why didn't they just build skyscrapers?"
---
You go to the bottom left of discord where your name is and click the gear icon for settings. In the list on the left there should be an overlay option which you can disable.
---
I'm in the same situation but I haven't even created a character except to reserve names.
---
The best advice I can give is to first decide the one single thing that you want the most (melee or caster, for example) and then choose based on that. I don't believe most people find a class that is a perfect fit for them because there are many variables within each and they're all flawed in some way.
---
You guys should probably try getting another job

Just so you know replying to everyone in a sarcastic and holier than thou attitude is a defence mechanism for a weak argument and should not he used if you wish to be taken seriously.

It has been 15 years but I don't think hunters had immolate or any of the other priest spells listed.  Though it has been awhile...

Did some elite quests with a group of 5 in Loch Modan.  Really nice team and we get through it quick.  Just by luck the 5 of us end up doing Deadmines later on, super good run with friendly peeps.  We are now all part of a guild.  Classic is so good

I hit level 22, then decided to leave the server in order to join a group of people I didn’t dislike and who treated me with respect and inclusion

At level 19 now, so fucking close to being back to where I was

People often forget most of the playerbase are more akin to you. Haven’t or barely raid, don’t look up optimal strats and builds, don’t crush through content with blazing speed, etc. They get used to players in their circles and forget they are a minority. Same thing happens in retail with players that push mythic raiding or high m+.
---
That makes no sense. Unless it is a target you simply shouldnt put CoA on (it dies before CoA damage starts to build)
---
What level do dungeons start? They’re my favorite part of the game
---
Right? Im really considering to roll something else. Sad because i have been a main healer since tbc and always had the luxury to be "one of the more demanded specs" but it seems that this has changed :/
---
Maybe I'm extremely unlucky but outside of my guild I haven't really interacted much with folks, even though I ran like 20ish dungeons already. It's all about "LFG SM" and then "hi" "oom" and "thanks cya". I try to initiate small talk sometimes but people just focus on the gameplay I guess :P
---
Just summon a doomguard in org.  If that doesn’t work wow is dead
---
It's just the barrens. Stick with it, it gets better and eventually you get to all the same alliance contested zones anyways.
---
Meanwhile I thought I could cheese it by going in my whisp form over to loch modan or dun morog and revive there. It didn't work and I had to walk all the way back.

I think this is wrong because the retail game doesn't make you work at all to get a group or to get gear. You're ported in from wherever with people who you don't know. Smash some bosses and collect loot. 
---
In classic there's a lot more work to do just to GET to the instance: 1) manually finding the proper group, 2) physically running there.
---
How can you put more effort into a game that's so convenient for you to just queue and wait to be teleported to the boss?

&gt; Rinse and repeat.

or stop at Wrath.

Yup, same. The relapse is real.

Had a level 20 UD mage, level 15, level 13 but got so tired of the toxic chat on every horde realm I tried...
---
I rolled a Gnome mage for the first time ever... I'm level 23 and LOVING my realm and the leveling as a mage process. I've just began the AoE grind and because I've never done it... I'M LOVING IT! Killed a Tauren Warrior in Darkshore near Auberdine (sp?) today, almost felt bad but then I remembered Barrens chat and got over it. 
---
Now I'm just trying to enjoy my grind and save every penny for a mount at 40!
---
Eventually I'll find a guild... I am waiting till I fund a group of people from the same guild that I enjoy. So far it's a bunch of people from like a million different ones and I like em all. Will mostly all.

i have no idea who this person is

Phase 2 is honor.  Phase 3 in bgs.  Odds are that it will be months between phases.  So a year isn't out of the question

Dude these assholes are the worst. I don’t get it. I’m at 35 undead mage on whitemane. Hayyz. I have been looking for some good pvp but have mostly just been helping people out. Of both factions! I ran across two alliances yesterday, a warrior and a rogue and I helped them kill their 8 mobs and then sheeped them up to full. It’s my new favorite thing to do to enemies! I’m all for wPvP but ganking just to be a dick is beyond me.
---
i agree but the way itemization is right now means its more aobut gear than the racials.
---
48 layers of 1K, but I would assume more like 4-5 layers of around 10K. Math was off a little but I don't think there are as many as 48 layers on a server
---
Just stream dude but dont get discouraged if no one shows up. It's just how everyone starts.

I'm enjoying it more than I thought I would. I wasn't even hyped for it and just sort decided on a whim to try it out a few days before release. I never played vanilla and I tried to get into retail numerous times over the last few years and just couldn't get into it. Even though I never played vanilla myself, there is a very nostalgic feeling that I get from it. It reminds me of what made me fall in love with MMOs back when I started playing FFXI.   
---
It's really a shame that developers have dumbed down and simplified current MMOs so much. I just finished playing through the new FFXIV expansion and while it was fun, it just feels more like a co-op RPG than an MMORPG. And even the RPG aspect is very watered down. Classic has been a breath of fresh air in that regard.
---
They're on your server too eh?
---
Fuck you china fuck you Brack Rotus
---
I doubt that you're able to transfer from low pop server to high pop one.

Just enjoy it while it lasts. Might be few months, might be few years, what matters is you have fun while doing it.

It has existed throughout these years. Whenever you wanted to, you could play it :)

Hanging out in barrens chat is like going to an awesome restaurant and eating your food out of the toilet.

Yeah, I'm not as young as when I originally played vanilla WoW.  A lot less time and more obligations, kids, work, etc.  I'm taking it slow and enjoying it.  Having a great time playing it this way and not stressed about getting to 60 right away.

Auction house. Already have 3 gold at level 13 just from flipping.
---
"Shitting" on retail/Blizz is how we got here. You call it shitting we call it criticism. Albeit aggressive.
---
I mean there isn't a lot of reason to bring a tank. 4 mages+healer is a really good dungeon comp.
---
Its really not, its just as easy.   Pressing 1 button and when you see a flash, press another button, and if that procs, press button 3 is just an easy and monotonous after 10 minutes as pressing 1 button.
---
Benediction beckons
---
Piggy backing off this statement, you can basically stay Arms/Fury till max lvl. Most of the Pre-60 Dungeons are tankable in Arms/Fury spec long as you got a sword 'n board. Plus if you get a good AF healer you can even tank w/out a sword and board. Back in Vanilla watched my Brother Tank Undead Strat w/a T1 Pally healer. Crazy thing is my brother was rocking Arcanite Reaper and holding threat like a beast.
---
&gt;That is provably not true and spoken from a place of privilege
---
This is really odd, he's giving you advice (and good advice), and you are calling him privileged rather than responding honestly. This sort of attitude may be the reason you're getting hate rather the feedback you want. Is it so surprising that you may not actually be a good person and are using your sexual orientation as a scapegoat for the hate, because it's better than coming to the terms that people may not really like you as a person? 
---
I have LGBT+ friends that play WoW and they don't have the problem you're describing, presumably because they don't make it a problem. A good buddy of mine is the Guild Leader of a 100+ person guild and he's never experienced the stuff you've describing, because he's an awesome person that helps everyone out, and his sexual status/gender has nothing to do with it.

&gt;Someone who hasn't been kicked out of multiple guilds for mentioning you are taking off to hang out with your boyfriend when everyone knows you are a man.
---
I have a GF and never mention it during raids/guid chats because it's never relevant to WoW, so I really don't know why you'd randomly bring up stuff like that when people really don't care. 
---
I've never seen anyone kicked out for mentioning they're gay or whatever, so it may be the people you hang around with and how you present yourself rather than anything to do with your status.
---
It was meant as sarcasm.
---
&gt; they come.
---
And oh, do they come.
---
I agree with this logic. Not being able to utilize CoC for the full effect screwed up my pulls a lot of times in the past.
---
I tried to take the name Ringo as soon as servers opened up &amp; because theres an NPC in ungoro crater named Ringo, it shows up as unavailable. Npcs need names too. Ringo is my irl name so

I always just kinda align my char and click autorun, then tab out for a minute.

He pretty much said that money is his main goal too. He said that if the IRS job he had paid as well as streaming he would have a hard time passing it up.
---
Took me an hour to get 4 mushrooms....
---
I also believe there is a one handed sword you get from a quest from WC which is very similar to the mace
---
Goldshire is the best place to meet people tbh
---
Yeah I just read the post properly whoops
---
Well if anything it will go the other way, people will leave so I can get on haha
---
I mean are you saying you want to arbitrarily run the dungeon slower for.... no reason?
---
I don’t understand?  More information please
---
I've had both Elv and neatplates work, and heard that threat plates works too. 
---
First time I installed I had issues, but realised I had "show enemy nameplates" off.
---
One convenient location, In Westfall..
---
Which item?
---
I’ve been having a great time aside from 2 individuals that told me to do something that isn’t possible (at that level without certain skills it is impossible and with them it’s time consuming). Other than that I’ve had a great time. 
---
Random rezzing is my favorite to do. Just come across a corpse and res the person. Started seeing others doing it too after a couple days
---
Hey getting raped by kobolds isn't a joke.  
---
I was raped by kobolds.
---
Around 30s is probably earliest
---
I forgot the other piece of my point I was going to make
---
All the other classes get more damage as they get more gear. That's fine. Warriors get more gear that almost always has a lot of stamina
---
So you'd think, oh that's balanced, the rogue gets more damaged and the warrior has more HP to survive the increasing burst that's coming
---
WRONG!!!!!!
---
Warriors get rage based off damage, \*not\* based off the % of HP they get chunked down. Piling on a warrior at 30 and killing him is fine. Piling on a lvl 60 warrior in epic PVP gear is just going to fill his entire rage bar as fast as he can dump it
---
So that rogue ganking you at lvl 30 might feed you a little rage. The rogue gets better gear, levels up, does more damage. Now he's feeding you \*more\* rage and making you hurt him harder, while you have a larger reservoir of HP to negate the main side-effect of damage, which is dying
---
All those shadowpriests people fear in pvp? Those are just your rage battery. Their mindblast keeps getting stronger as they gear up. Stronger for \*you\*. It used to hurt. You both gear up. Now it still hurts, but it also fills your rage meter to full instead of barely giving you enough for a single ability
---
Cheers. Thank you!
---
Click this macro &gt; Thunder Clap &gt; Shift click this macro.
---
I like PvP, So I only dungeon tank. If I were to raid I would remove the "/equip [nomod] 2H Weapon" line so as not to drop the shield.
---
Oh, you talking about VC?
---
Its not realistic for large guilds to swap and if you made a name for yourself on a server why would you swap? Im lookin at you Steve and your steve guild on stalagg.
---
Whoa, that was a seriously asshole move.
---
Is there anyway to track that you haven't done any quests, used AH, traded, etc?
---
In raids youll want to be a healer, otherwise farm lots of stuff to become viable. All 4 roles for druid are viable in raids with farming.
---
Im leveling a druid for the first time and having a blast switching between healing,dps and tanking questing in groups. Even between pulls some pulls call for bear while others call for cat.
---
Interested as well. I have 2015 MBP 13”. Does WoW actually have MacOs client?
---
Thats perfectly reasonable. This was about joanas guide
---
No. No. No. BC only without flying. I can accept dailies but NO FLYING. Remake the bc world slightly to make ground mounts work well everywhere and bc would be perfect. I like the class design a lot more in bc than in classic. But flying ruined the game, it was literally the worst thing that ever happened to wow. Maybe a 20% mount speed buff as purchasable mount rank would be acceptable.
---
Same here. I knew I wanted to thank, prot was tank spec, thus I leveled as prot all the way to 60. Since it was my only character I never understood that I was living in a special slice of vanilla hell. I remember it would take me about 3 minutes to kill one yeti in Winterspring at 55. It took me about a year of playing to hit 60. But it was glorious. 
---
This time round I'm a huntard. Already 29. Life is good.
---
It's called a humble brag.
---
Next you’ll be complaining about the legendary link fest
---
Probably warrant a name change.

I never see the shaman until I see the Frost Shock.
---
I think we should just call it Cookie going forward. It's neither VC nor DM and can't be confused with anything else in the game. See! Solved!
---
To be fair, I guess I was thinking upper level 5 mans, probably all the way up to rfk is pretty tame. In regards to that kind of time in dungeon, also pretty crazy, so I can't really argue against that kind of crap.
---
I’m not evil. 
---
I just like the cute little squeak gnomes make when you murder them...
---
I wish I didn’t have to have my demon out to know whether or not I have the skills purchased
---
That’s part of why I suggested the hard mode. Everyone’s at a huge advantage compared to actual vanilla.
---
Does the colour of a quest in my quest log have any effect on the experience gained when turning it in?
---
I would 100%. I doubt they'd do something as crazy as a new raid though. But I'd totally be down for added world events down the road.
---
Oh look that nice horde fella is coming to help you.
---
Life begins at 60
---
&gt;I think we should just call it Cookie going forward. It's neither VC nor DM and can't be confused with anything else in the game. See! Solved!
---
They had green gear, wasnt full raid and plenty of them were 57, Classic raiding is easy i dont know why people dont understand this.
---
might give that a try, was looking at a few Disc/holy hybrid builds. Regardless looks like I'm going to have to unlearn my talents.
---
Never thought of it like that. Cheers mate
---
can someone explain me, why he is running backwards so fast? is it not aspect of the cougar as far as i can see.
---
lol It's incredible! It's like they can't help themselves. The only advantage is that they make themselves known so then you know never to interact with that person.
---
As with everything else that made people stop playing some time between vanilla and retail: it changes the character of the game.  
---
Before: armor is a reflection of where someone is at in the game, and the world has a presence, the world affects what you can and cannot do.  
---
After: none of that matters, its a game.  Wear what you want, what someone is wearing says nothing about where they are in the world and just says something about the taste of the player.
---
Gather everyone in a guild together in vanilla, you can see, are they a raiding guild?  A pvp guild? A fresh leveling guild?  But you look in retail ... its just noise
---
I love how much screwing around I am doing this time around instead of worrying about leveling and gearing up.
---
Professions
---
phase 2 won't come out until they have data that a lot of people are 60 and  the servers matured
---
Right! Sorry, I lost track of the decimal point. 
---
Check out the reply I just made to another player.
---
I just hit level 20 an my rogue and was afraid to start a warrior because of how behind I would be. I needed this right now, I'm going to make my war and just have fun who cares.
---
Definitely, pretty much every private nerfed DM farming for Mages for example
---

---
no1 gives a fuck about your names dog
---
You can't get any accurate data on how many high levels there are either though. Seriously, trying to use /who for general population data is pretty much worthless.
---
Why do so many people in the WoW community get so touchy whenever someone mentions they're LGBT?
---
Great advice, thank you!

A similar story from back in the day. I was running ZG at level 70 for fun when the raptor mount dropped (I was alliance).  
---
My friend was running the raid.  We all /roll and I rolled low. I said in chat "I won!" and my friend believed me so he gave it to me.
---
That's how I got the raptor mount as a gnome mage. I was also 14 years old. I wouldn't do that anymore, though my friend should've also saw that I actually did not win.
---
Are the classes relatively balanced?  I wanted to relieve my childhood as a Dwarf Hunter but i've heard some negativity towards Hunter balance.  Any suggestions?  Also eyeing Paladin, Druid, or mage (which seems to be really popular with the streamers).
---
The groups clearing MC and Ony in under a week did so because they pacticed the raids thouroughly in private servers.  A hard mode would just give them more loot for something they already know exactly how to do.
---
Horde tend to stick to Kalimdor while Alliance stick to Eastern Kingdom.
---
Alterac Mountains are very convenient for Alliance questing in Arathi Highlands. Its a bit of a trek from the nearest 30-40 Horde zone(Desolace or maybe STV).
---
&gt;but I did finally get a quest helper 
---
What are you using?
---
Zandalar Tribe, you may well have!
---
This is super true. I am having a blast leveling my warrior day by day even though it is going to take a while and leveling as warrior is rough. Gonna take some time and level up my alchemy so I can use potions to help out the grind. Or maybe go fishing. Im having more fun than I even thought I would playing the game again. Incredible experience
---
Most likely, but personally I don't care. I'd rather have all my friends online when they can play than hold on onto my name
---
Pardon my ignorance, but why would someone want to do this? I mean other than for the challenge itself, is there any benefit in moving that specific race to that specific city?
---
I have like 4 toons on the go lol. No pressure to rush to 60 or anything. Enjoying the old classic style.
---
//SIGNED//
---
You seem like a dude who likes to chop vegetables more than he likes to cook and eat some tasty food.
---
&gt; Prestiging a character to experience the new 1-60? (like COD? probably bad, expansions might become forced ladder resets almost)
---
Imagine this:
---
New expansion releases, adds new leveling content and a new endgame raid, level cap is still 60... But you have to "prestige" 1-50 to access the new area and 50-60 is the new leveling content. Prestiging gives a ~10% exp increase to make old content go faster but new content takes more exp to level. Give a very small permanent bonus for people who complete prestige leveling. And a after a few months, turn off the requirement of prestige to see new content.
---
I think that would get players the excitement of a fresh launch without sending all the max lvl characters to an isolated area like expansions tend to do. Power creep wouldnt be as bad, since it's the same max level and each new expansion would offer new 50-60 content. Someone starting the game late would just have to do the regular 1-60 grind and gear up until the prestige requirement is turned off.
---
Only big pitfall I see is someone getting to Prestige ~40 slowly and feeling locked out of the new content after the Prestige requirement turns off. So maybe provide an option to cancel Prestige and return to regular lvl 60 if they give up on it.
---
Oh my god the inhumanity Jesus christ
---
But are you also level 7?
---
Looks like a good way to get in an accident.
---
Imagine being on trial for vehicular manslaughter and they read out to the court that you ran someone over because you just had to kill one more boar.
---
Hey Peter, check out channel 5!
---
Not to mention that at least the MT and MH had a few epics drop throughout MC.  It's not crazy to think that the MT had 3-4  pieces of might by rag.
---
&gt; hell even snippit tool.
---
Ever heard of WIN+SHIFT+S ?
---
Precision at 14+ helps and so does weapon skill
---
Oh I know that now, back in 2005....not so much.
---
&gt;It amazes me how many people were able to fly through levels
---
There was a glitch with getting raid experience in dungeons (that OP admits to using) that gave people 3x exp basically. It was hotfixed over the weekend.
---
Implying I ever said they wouldn't. 
---
I asked, why would they? I never said they wouldn't. I was asking a rhetorical question, making a statement, being "you don't deserve a free transfer". 
---
Either way, glad people are happy.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.8.0
---
Raid groups were granting way too much experience in dungeon instances. Was hotfixed recently.
---
I didn't watch 'the race' but I gather the runners &amp; streamers were abusing it pretty heavily to level members.
---
Let people do what they want, 
---
it's not only about gay people, everyone gets laughed at, races, nationalities, you name it.
---
 today barrens chat was talking about how in China they eat dogs but in Germany they fuck em but it doesn't mean they hate Germans or Chinese they just want a conversation topic with a humorous tone and not necessarily to inflict harm or spread hate about a certain sexuality/nationalitie.
---
 Take everything with a grain of salt and you'll be better off in game and in life.
---
I play on a 2017 MacBook air and it works fine. Just dont crank the Graphical up to ultra.
---
well that escalated quickly
---
What realm was this? Would lovely to join haha
---
I know have a purpose this weekens
---
They're going to be opening up free server transfers for people on the most overpopulated realms so that should help at least a bit.
---
Has this not always been feign death? It's a chance at escape at best? I remember it not working often.
---
The real talk is that if you aren't playing classic enough to get to 60 after 2 years, you don't deserve a say in the future of classic content.
---
I used to. Like for example im on a 5man and tank pulls a group, I stand in stealth, pickpocket the full group while tank builds aggro then star dps
---
Downvoted for asking a poor/awfully cliche philosophical question.
---
Yeah i dont know why people are shitting on /r/wow constantly here and why people constantly say that Classic is harder than retail just to make themselves feel more etilist or better by playing Classic.
---
You're right. No logistics, preparation, patience, or coordination were needed during the 400 pulls it took Method to kill Queen Azshara. They just smashed their faces on the keyboard until she died.
---
Don't worry, most of us are broke. This isn't retail where money is thrown around from everything. You need to be cheap, smart, and careful with your money. All gold spent (silver) needs to go to the biggest improvements first.
---
‘doggo is a good boi’

Premium reddit-ism cringe. Nice work 👌
---
i had ~~almost~~ no problems till 20, maybe i'm just picking the wrong fights
---
unspecced thunderclap is, what, 20 rage? i don't know if you can call that spamming. also only usable in battle stance.
---
Yes, but they won't be added until later.
---
I think it's greed because you end up selling the item to profit and not use it, where as need means you need to equip the item and make use of it.
---
I think the original game manual taught players about how loot systems worked, definitely a confusing moment for new players.
---
iam leveling as duo warrior/priest but iam always losing agro from the priest even he just spamming wand + Dot(the yellow with a skull)  there\`s a cool way to not lose so easily ?
---
Dang...I should really get my fishing skill. 
---
(Waiting to see the jerks that are going to give you crap for not screenshotting)
---
I absolutely see delayed wand attacks when taking damage. It’s not entirely consistent but it is there.
---
I don't actually play, I tap the screen so I don't disconnected.
---
People are crying that /r/wow is toxic as hell but here i see a daily post shitting on that subreddit or on BFA and nobody says a thing.
---
You can definitely only have one.
---
It’s kind of disingenuous to say they made dungeons easier without elaborating on the m+ system that was introduced in legion. There are infinite difficulty levels of dungeons now in modern wow. So your scenario in UBRS still happens. 
---
It’s up to the ambition of the player if they want to tackle the difficult content or pretend they’ve seen it all with their easy version of the same content. For instance, a +20 version of any dungeon in BFA is far more difficult to overcome mechanically than Qumran dungeon in classic, but if you want a “tour” version to just see the content but not be actually engaged in gameplay, the base normal mode of a dungeon would satisfy you and can be completed with minimal competence. 
---
Whether or not this devalues content is up to your opinion, but personally(as a US 6th raider in legion) I don’t care what content is available to casual players as long as my engaging content doesn’t suffer for it, and, in my opinion, it didn’t. It doesn’t bother me when people kill an LFR version of guldan that is easily accessible through a queue, my mythic version was still server locked and pretty unpuggable until it was already outdated content. 
---
This isn’t me saying retail is better than classic wow. They are separate games at this point, but to frame modern wow’s dungeons as “nerfed to hell” is far from the truth. Classic wow has a billion aspects that make it a great game that modern wow doesn’t have.
---
is classic a separate download? or can I just jump on the game I already have installed (havnt played since may, but its been auto updating. yay 120mb unlimited internet)
---
Retail has felt like a game lobby for years without the companies imho.
---
&gt;Idk, OSRS has had polling since its inception and it hasn't voted back in all the content that people people hate about RS3, only the good stuff. 
---
That's kind of disingenuous since they've added plenty of both gear and "QoL" (read oversaturation of teleporting everywhere and the likes) which are same but different to what rs3 had.
---
Sure, your blowpipe isn't named chaotic crossbow but it is vastly better for everything you use ranged that you would use chaotic cbow on. Just to name one thing.
---
You are in Durotar, in the Valley of Trials. You have killed all the boars there.
---
I am on the server, also in Durotar, also in Valley of Trials. Boars are everywhere. We're on the same server but we're in different "Layers."
---
"How does this differ from shards within retail?" you might be asking.
---
I don't know.
---
Just get the first tier pushback to healing spell talent (2 points) in the holy tree once you get mindflay. 
---
That’s all you really should have for leveling in dungeons.  The rest is just for efficiency. Once you get flash heal, you basically ignore heal. 
---
Stack spirit gear.  Learn the five second rule. Wand if you must do damage. Save mana for heals.
---
You won’t escape toxicity by switching servers. Best to grow a spine and leave chats that upset you.
---
I made a good amount at early levels by buying/bidding on stuff on the AH that is under vendor price. Especially weapons and linen bags. A lot of weapons, even grey ones, vendor at several silver yet people will put them up for less. With linen bags, a lot of people will set the bid price very low, when they vendor for 2s. Then you can resell them (watch your bid starting price!) Or just vendor them.
---
There is an "attack table" that determines what every normal 'white' melee attack does. Stuff in the table always adds up to 100%. Please note this is attacking an equal level mob from the front. Attacking a mob from the back removes their chance to parry and block (but you can still miss and they can still dodge), which is why it is important in dungeons to get behind a mob unless you're the tank (or a ranged/caster)
---
Assuming your weapon skill is capped (and you don't have additional weapon skills from gear/race) your attacks have a:
---
5% miss chance
---
5% dodge chance
---
5% parry chance
---
5% block chance (all mobs can block even if they don't have a shield)
---
10% chance to be glanced
---
5% chance to crit
---
65% chance to hit
---
Glancing blows and blocks do damage, but reduced amounts of damage.
---
Taking the table above, you have an 85% chance to hit an equal level mob. Some of those hits will be blocked or glanced doing less damage but will still hit, and some hits will crit doing more damage. 
---
In your case, being +5 weapon skill would make the table look like this:
---
4.5% miss chance
---
4.5% dodge chance
---
66% chance to hit
---
Doesn't seem like all that much, you only gained a 1% chance to hit an equal level mob by reducing your miss chance and their dodge chance by 0.5% each. But fighting equal level mobs isn't where your +5 axes is actually useful. If we start plugging in all the formulas for mobs higher level than you (remember, raid bosses are level 63) the results change a bit, but if you're curious you can look this information up because there is a lot to go in to involving mob defense rating vs your weapon skill rating. But in short if you're wielding a single weapon (or for 'yellow' attacks for skills) your miss rate against bosses would only be 6%, and someone who didn't have +5 weapon skill would have a 9% miss rate. This means you have to get less +hit on your gear than a non-orc.
---
TL;DR because this really dry: When gearing for raids or whatever this means that you, an orc, only need to get 6% extra hit chance to be hit capped with your axe, and any non-orcs (or orcs using weapons other than an axe) need to get 9% extra hit chance to be hit capped. +5 weapon skill also reduces the damage reduction of glancing blows but a not-insgnificant amount (from a 35% penalty against bosses to 15%). Please also note you always glance 40% of the time against mobs 3+ levels higher than you (and raid bosses are 63 in Vanilla). Always. You can't change or avoid that, but weapon skill can make it so your glancing blows come closer to your regular damage.
---
The best way would be to take a page from Path of Exile.
---
End the current run of Classic and give players the option to port Classic characters to either Classic Eternal (No changes, 6th phase continues indefinitely) or Burning Crusade. Then open Classic Season 2 when BC opens. When comes time to progress from BC to Wrath, do the same thing: BC toons can be ported to Wrath or BC Eternal, Classic S2 toons can be ported to Classic Eternal, BC S2, or BC Eternal.
---
At any one time, there's the current season of that version and the forever-running eternal version. Speedrun peeps get to have their fresh starts and world/server firsts, people who want to slow-roll their endgame raiding get the time to do so in a mature economy that gets an injection of players at the end of every season. Both progression and non-progression communities get what they want.
---
also this is like "finally blizz listening" while i am her elike "yo bitch opf course they had to do it not immediately else it would destabilize things further"
---
Humans have the best PvE racial in the game(sword specialization), plus gnomes get an int bonus.
---
For PvP, its pretty balanced.
---
You'd be surprised what you can do with macros. I don't think it's too complicated for WoW you just have to know what to do I'd just Google it
---
Here is a breakdown of the [Wow Classic Roadmap] for adding content post launch.  Phase 3 is AV/Warsong and Phase 4 is Arathi. No word yet on a time frame for these releases. (https://www.dexerto.com/world-of-warcraft/wow-classic-new-content-roadmap-pvp-ahnqiraj-war-effort-more-961139)

Name is Araga, she has/had a weird tail and some sort of manes. They changed this at some point in WoW and I am not sure when this happened so she might not be unique with the current patch.
---
Are there any working add ons for detecting rare spawns?
---
I'm jumpin vetween races, classes, faction, and servers
---
Moderation is relative. Like how you have "steaming food" hot and then you have "exploding star" hot. Which makes moderation the surface of the sun.
---
Yes they are all balanced.  
---
Play what you want to do.  You will have the most fun,
---
Imagine a grown adult taking 6 days off at work, in the middle of the summer, to sit inside a room and play a 15 year old video game for 12+ hours a day 😂
---
Let's say normally you regen 100 mana every tick.  As long as you never finish casting a spell, you'll stay at this regen rate.  
---
After spending mana, you'll regen 0 mana per tick for 5 seconds (that's the 5-second rule).  
---
With the talent, you'll regen 15 mana per tick during those 5 seconds.
---
I literally never watch streams. I’m just responding to the comment above. All I know about streamers is from this sub.
---
Took me a month to hit 60 in 2004, I don’t expect it to be any different this time around.
---
Enhanced casting bar is another choice
---
Got mc'd off the booty bay boat in the middle of the ocean twice now by horde priests. Such dick heads. Not all of them but God dam do I notice horde doing crap like this a lot more.
---
Really if you get your guild to 60 first, there's no oppostion to stop you from wiping out whatever city you want
---
Stagnant Oasis consistently has plenty of mushrooms, but everyone goes north where there are like 5 being camped by 20 people.
---
it's always appreciated
---
WoTF = Will of the Forsaken, it basically allows a Undead to break a Fear effect. Wait till Ubrs shows up and your told you can only come to the dungeon if you can Kite Drake...aka the lost boss. When I was a fresh 60 my guild couldn't find a Hunter and they told me they'd bring me if I could kite the last boss of Ubrs. I was all, "Umm whats kiting." I learned and after two wipes I was able to kite him all the way to the whelps room practically.
---
Hmmm I saw a nightelf in the dwarf starting zone only 12 minutes after server launched. Must have been lucky with the boat
---
You can level ret and still heal. I would say keep a dress and a caster weapon in your bags for it.
---
It’s definitely useful, nice strength buff, just be careful if you’re a Tauren. You’ll get stuck in doorways a lot.
---
I played every version of the game and leveled a ton of characters because im an altoholic. I got a total of 2 BoE epics.
---
If you're bored playing a game you need to do something else. If you force yourself to play when you don't want to, you'll burn out and start hating the game.
---
Leave the computer. Go do something around the house. Get some fresh air and exercise.
---
When you're away from the game, you often think of fun stuff you want to do in the game, like gear you want to track down or dungeons you want to run.
---
Leveling should be a by-product of having fun, not a chore.
---
Hunters are good class to pick for good DPS and good crowd control.  Mages were God in vanilla pvp
---
this is R/classicwow isnt it?
---
Only if you actually type /who. If you type 55-60 it will show everyone in that level range.
---
Transmog was horrible. Ugh. I love my mismatched gear on my mage.
---
...straight to the mailbox
---
Same with Lucifron
---
...But your initial point shows the exact opposite.
---
Sitting on a highly populated server with queues can result in so many people fleeing the server that the hugely populated server dies. So even sitting still on a server you are having to wait 6 hours to get on each night isn't going to promise that the server is going to remain that way in the future.
---
But dem 10 man AOE grinds in Armory...... What fun at such a low lvl :) 
---
And ya, I DO remember back in vanilla the Raid Xp being STUPID LOW, and that made sense, as you were splitting the kill with potentially 39 other people.  If anything, i remember getting like 2% of what a kill should give off XPwise, but that was long ago, and might not be remembering properly.
---
One of APES largest streamers streamed nearly all the way to 60 and they did it in 5 man groups. They did turn of streams for lbrs/ubrs though so who knows what happened then I guess.
---
Well pretty much everything is going to go up in price. As for specific items that will be in high demand, I'm not too sure.
---
It's been a long time since Vanilla and It's don't remember which items were highly sought after. I know about the swiftthistle only because a couple of months ago I was trying out a couple of different classes on a private server. Rogues can make Swiftthistle Tea (restores 100% energy) and once BGs are released and lots of people start raiding I'm 100% sure these will be in high demand.  Even if they're only going to sell for 50s each, that's still a 2500% increase on price.
---
If you can afford any BOE blue armor items, you can make a decent amount that way too. Currently on my server they're selling for around 10g and most will be worth 40-100g later on. So if you have any BOE blues drop, don't equip them and save them to sell later.
---
Lvl 60 Tauren warrior and hit Rank 14, nothing more godlike than the first day you get all the weapons along with the PVP armor.
---
Realm queues would be fixed if people rolled on realms with no queues
---
you can CoC infinitely,  if its just a few mobs (usually just one) that resists you can run in a wide circle to kite the mobs as long as you apply cone to all of them it won't be messy at all you can keep circling until they clump up and your nova is back off cd, which you can then carry of as normal
---
In Hillsbrad yesterday, I kept seeing my GF all over the place because of the bears and mountain lions to skin.
---
Didn’t help I kept adding to the pile!
---
Squash some cloth weating gnomes
---
Thats like over half of the population. Or maybe it's because I'm on an rpvp server
---
Don't forget to get rid of dailies.
---
I remember trying to kill the same mobs on a pserver. Good luck snagging one from the 60's.
---
"someone calls someone else the F slur"
---
Yeah I am still suspicious of where Blizz will want to send people. I was a Wrath baby and ended up on the 2nd least progressed NA server because that's where Blizz needed the noobs to go and GL. 
---
 But it makes sense since they bungled the rollout so badly. They need to do something to alleviate the pressure. I just think rerolling on a barely full server right now is the safe move. Plus you can play right now. My son has had such little /played that he's only level 20.
---
Netherwind low/med no queue 4 days old
---
Also going through your history I can see why you are so intent on arguing that saying bigoted shit is fine.
---
I'll sometimes use a rank 1 Earth Shock if no one else has a counterspell type of thing, but that's about it.
---
"Leveling a warrior is slow." Fixed for you.
---
Knew it!!!
---

---
No wonder the community around you seems toxic..
---
You can try to create a find macro that you can use in a zone that is something like "/tar \[MOB NAME\]". If it targets them, they're spawned, if it can't find them, they aren't. Group just did that for Miner Johnson in the Deadmines.
---
ho boy here comes the Faerlina and Herod squad
---
where did you farm the wolfhide?
---
I will always envy them for this one reason.
---
I want to get paid to play -.-
---
I’ve only been able to play like 2 or 3 hours. The first day I was off was Labor Day, I woke up at 7am and played till 11pm. It was a glorious waste of time. 
---
The worst part for me is that I work 3-11p on weekends and the q time when I get home is still 3-4 hours so I can’t even play when I get home. 
---
I’m on my way home now at 7pm, I probably won’t get on till 12
---
If im working on a quest to kill a mob for a drop, and i group with a party that is on a quest to kill 10x of that same mob. Does my quest apply to all the mobs we attack?
---
I've never played a WoW game before. Is it hard to get in too? My keyboard skills arent the greatest so I've always been nervous to try it out due to all of the hotkeys involved
---
32 Hunter. Been playing a ton, but taking awhile to level. Helped one guildie get their WW Axe, another get their Pally Mace, and another get their Warlock robes. Ran some dungeons. Killed some horde. Good times.
---
i just downloaded team viewer and will log in around an hour before ill be home from work and i never have to wait
---
oh i know i've been doing it too lmao..
---
I've always enjoyed to be in the underdog factions in MMO it feels more epic.
---
I understand most horde player like to have it easy so that's why they prefer the imbalance.
---
End game they're monsters but yeah, leveling is gonna be a bitch. See if you can't find a paly or priest to level with. With some pocket heals they're fun to level.
---
UIM still has access to a bunch of secondary storage options as well.
---
No.  Blizz said they may implement paid server transfers in the future though since that service existed during vanilla.  They also said, however, that transfers will likely face the same restrictions they did during vanilla.  If they go through with that last bit, it's unlikely they'll allow transfers to full realms at all.  Time will tell what they end up doing though.
---
This is a bad idea. As someone who’s has done nothing but try to convince this sub that classic+ is the future of this game... this idea is horrible and horrible for two very obvious reasons. 
---
1. Power creep (stat inflation) so for these raids to be worth doing other than “challenge” they would have to introduce stronger gear and this would cause an imbalance in world pvp... this is a big no no. 
---
2. It splits the player base up, which is something we don’t want. You see all these story’s of meeting people in the barrens and questing with them for hours. This happens cause we’re all working towards the same goal, hardmodes cause half the player base to go one way and the other half the other way. We can’t have this.
---
I haven't had that issue. Friend of mine did though and it went away when he reinstalled the addon and restarted the game.
---
Haha. Yep! I am all over the place.
---
I think windseeker came out on the.....3rd wave of new server? I think?
---
Yeah it's looking like I got a lot of planning ahead of me, which is very exciting. Thank you for showing me Draw.io, this is a very neat program that I have a feeling will get a lot of use for me. A discord is a good idea and honestly I could use the help from more seasoned classic players
---
My only worry is that they rush phase 2 out. 
---
I, like most, am unable to dedicate anywhere near the 300 days /played I have from vanilla to BC, so it’s going to take me a while to get to 60, and then even longer to get through all the raids. 
---
Give me a couple of years and let me savour it all.
---
good guy gregg, times two
---
It's worth thinking about. There's plenty of times you'll want to swap stances without swappping your weapon.
---
Tanking an enemy that fears for example, you don't want to put your shield away to immune the fear.
---
Fighting against a Warrior or Rogues, you want to disarm them, but don't want to put your 2h away and/or reset your weapon swing, twice!
---
That's 2 extra GCDs you're eating, one swapping in and one swapping back, 3 seconds of doing nothing.
---
I just have my stances bound. And I've got my gearsets bound to another button, so I can swap to a S+S or 2h at anytime, unrelated to swapping stances.
---
I try to grind in one hour or two hour bursts. Then I watch a few videos or get up and do something around the house.
---
I'm not really talking about retail in any of my posts, just you guys are.
---
You should try either Warrior, mage, Priest, hunter, Druid, shaman, warlock, or paladin
---
I wish you the best of luck! At least sword and board looks cool as hell!
---
I haven’t even logged in lol. All of my friends are already level capped or almost level capped. 
---
I think it’s insane that Ragnaros had a world first.
---
yea but the destination server is also 60-40 horde, classic is 60-40 horde
---
Names require other people to report them. We very rarely ever changed names that werent reported to us.
---
does it also concern druid in bear form ?
---
I thought most of them were disabled? I'll have to go read up.
---
&gt; any healing you do generates threat equal to 50% of the heal, split among all enemies.
---
&gt; So let's say your renew heals the tank for 100, if there's three enemies, they all get 33 threat.
---
If your renew heals the tank for 100, wouldn't 50% of that heal split between three enemies be about 17 threat each? Just checking because this is very interesting info, I didn't know there were hard numbers generated for threat either.
---
Hit the lawyer, delete the gym, Facebook up!
---
Well... they're not wrong
---
The whole point of this game is to relive the original progression of the game and to give those who haven't had the chance to live it a chance to.  The point is not to take it and rework it and throw a bunch of changes and retail shit in. It's supposed to be classic, hense the namesake?
---
It’s a game. Paid transfers exist if the server they’re on is empty. 
---
Blizzard has tech that can group low pop servers so even then it isn’t as bad as people think.
---
Is Wow really so much more in depth than every other game in existence that paywall strategy guides makes any sense? Name any other game in existence, and I can probably find half a dozen thorough strategy guides and wikis to help you out with it. Why does it make any sense to even theoretically pay any amount of money for this information?
---
Yeah... sure... it's definitely the community...
---
That was added burning crusade. 
---
- Heal the tank, don't let the tank die. #1 priority.
---
- Don't let yourself die. But usually, you should be OK if the other party members are doing their job. Use Fade if you have to. Just generally keep an eye on your health. I tend to let it drop sometimes because I know I can always PW:S myself and keep myself up, but don't let it *too* low.
---
- Use first aid if you have to.
---
- Try not to heal too early until the tank has built up some threat. Wait a few seconds if you can.
---
-  Use PW:S as little as possible unless a caster has agro or it's an emergency. It gets more nuanced - an occasional pre-PW:S may be acceptible if there's a big damage spike incoming.
---
- Never mind blast unless the mob is about to die. It generates massive threat.
---
- People hate on renew, but I find it super useful so YMMV. It's not quite as efficient as raw healing but it's good for off healing a rogue or popping on a tank during a spikey damage period, or just popping on the tank during trash mobs while you wand.
---
- This is personal preference, but I changed my party frames to raid frames 100% of the time. I find it a better UI for healing.
---
- Try not to use flash heal unless you have to.
---
- Get the enemy cast addon. Then you can see if the main target is casting something like sleep, which is important information to react to (dispel a friend? silence the caster mid cast?)
---
- You can probably downrank your heals. There are some excact guides and calculations, but just get a feel for how much health your party members have and how spikey the damage in the dunegon is. I remember running WC and my newly ranked Heal was basically the warrior's entire health bar, so I used a lower rank. And when I was dead OOM I had a very low ranked lesser heal on there just to keep someone up.
---
- Don't overheal.
---
- Watch your 5 second rule for mana regen. Don't needlessly cast spells if you don't need to, keep regenning mana.
---
- Flash heal is mana inefficient so don't use it as your primary PVE heal unless there's a lot of unpredictable damage.
---
- Unless there's a reason to keep everyone topped at 100% for an incoming damage spike, don't waste mana healing people who are 80-90% health who just took a one-off hit.
---
- Do not use fear unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure it won't run them into other mobs, or if it's a last-ditch emergency. This is a major wipe-factor.
---
- Use mind soothe if you're trying to finesse past a group of mobs without killing them.
---
- If you mind control a mob it will stick aggro to you no matter what the tank does.
---
- Carry some mana potions for 'oh shit' moments.
---
- Pre-60 when you're shadow spec, if you can grab spirit tap off a kill it's great to keep your mana up.
---
Played WOW once when it first came out and never got back into it because EQ2. Maybe I should give it a whirl?
---
Not bored but I play both am alliance paladin and horde warlock. Mixes things up
---
So do I my friend, so do I
---
Where do you go?
---
Another vote for 'more than I thought'. Coming in I thought I'd just give Blizzard $15, play for a week and quit at level 20. Now I'm pretty sure I'm going to get 60. 
---
Longevity? If there's a solid PvP community on my server then yeah probably. I also want to do Naxx but that's super far away, doubt ill be subbed quite that long.
---
I've dabbled in WOW about 3 years ago. Just got a trial run but I lost interest after a week because I dont have any friends that play the game and I chucked out because of the stigma of MMORPGs (i know. Bad reason to quit but the stigma is real regardless) 
---
ANYWAYS, I'm quite aware that people seem to enjoy this classic version better. What makes Classic better than the "new" (modernized) one?
---
Responding to your worthless offer would be just wasting their time.
---
no way, 2/3 means the slow isn't strong enough to keep a mob inside the Blizzard radius for the entire duration, you want 3/3 so you can get a full channel of Blizzard, move a bit and then Blizzard again, 2 sets of blizzard 1 nova like i previously explained
---
You'll only have a chance to loot the quest item from mobs that are "your" loot, assuming it's set to group loot.
---
Not wroth the time because the market is flooded.
---
I think the trend is the usual 40-45% alliance to 55-60% horde
---
So why would it be bad if retail had rotations that are only 3 buttons?
---
Uh huh, because they 100% know everything about every encounter in there and how best to do them, they are also highly organized and have been preparing for literally years.   If you think you're gonna PUB MC with your greens, you are mistaken.   
---
I really don't give a flying fuck what top tier guilds do in classic, retail, or any other video game in the world.   They are effectively playing a different game than I am (and exploiting like crazy along the way), sure there are things I can learn from them, but you are cherry picking what the 0.05% can do, and in fact do, and calling it all that exists, when its not.   There will be newer players and casual guilds doing their first MC attempts MONTHS from now, and wiping, a lot.    
---
I never made any claims that raids are harder for folks who are die-hard try-hards (because again, I could care less about them), but for casuals used to LFR, they will be a slap in the face and a kick in the nuts.    I'm somewhere in the middle.
---
Is it possible to learn this power.
---
As an altoholic of 13.5 years, it's not a fun disorder. I hate wanting to reroll but it's like an itch that won't go away. Gotta scratch it. 
---
I haven't played in like 4 days and only lvl 10 on my shaman while waiting for my buddy to stop being so busy with irl stuff and I'm already kinda wanting to drop shaman for Hunter or lock. But I know ele will be fun later..... So I'll prob play till 30-40 then get the unscratchable itch and make a Hunter or lock. Then make something else around 30-40 again. 
---
Luckily I only wanna play those 3 classes in classic so it won't be as bad as retail.
---
I'm sure there's an add-on for it.
---
The extra benefit is that instead of deciding who out of 40 people get loot, it's who out of 20. It's literally double loot.
---
I’ll actually probably take advantage of this. Any idea on timeline? Which server is a decent population and East Coast and PVP? I’m Incendius and waits are REAL
---
It would definitely help.
---
Nope.  While they certainly aren't helping, the real problem was the lack of servers when reservations were opened.
---
As a monthly fee though? That just seems nonsensical.
---
The real trick is stay in zones as long as possible. If you quest 1-4 levels over the mobs the experience is much better. One you hit mobs 1-2 over you, reconsider.
---
You can just jump servers willy nilly on retail I thought
---
I only save thicc leather.
---
Hoped you bought enough mats to finish leveling it up!
---
Play something you didn't play before, I was a lock back in the day and loved it, but rolled warrior in classic so I could fill a different role.  Try being a caster class and see if you like it, mages are dps monsters and locks are solo machines that get a free mount.
---
It’s the entertainment or knowledge they provide. Not really the game they play. 
---
No different than watch TV, YouTube, Sports, theatre (not the movies), movies, opera, etc.
---
Monster Hunter gunlance vibes.
---
good at journalism, excellent editors
---
Why would anyone ever pay for this if they weren't already using it, and instead look up a similar guide instead?
---
I dunno man, blue seems really good but that green one requires level 24.  It has to be pretty badass to require level 24. And you don’t want people seeing you walking around with low level gear like a scrub
---
I don't get it?
---
Seperate it into two macros, use one to switch to the dagger and cast back stab and another to switch to the sword and cast sinister strike, you should have more luck that way. 
---
Alternatively forget about backstab and just be a combat sword rogue
---
Nothing but a bunch of pretentious assholes circle jerking
---
Who gives a fuck how another person plays a game as long as they're not cheating/hacking
---
Awesome post. I am only lvl 22 but I am enjoying myself so much :P
---
Altho, I can't wait to walk into BRD and L/UBRS...
---
!remindme6months time to go the ah!
---
I'm hopping around between alts, working on profs by farming mats, fishing, the works. Not even fussed about hitting 60 on any one alt. Why rush it? I'm not gonna raid, so there's no reason for me to do so.
---
Level 27 warrior. Gold could be better, having a total of 6g, but my gear requires constant check-ins, so there's that. Playing the AH really makes leveling one hell of a lot easier, but still warrior-miserable.
---
All in all, quite tedious, but I can endure this, I have to endure this, and I will endure this :S
---
Okay thanks!
---
Prot is much more of a main tank thing too. It's been talked to death almost. Unless the raid boss is the one smacking you, hybrid prot arms is effective
---
i clearly did judging off the replies to this
---
Im warlock so dont have bubble unless i want to summon big blue. But it should be easy to test in a duel VS player that dont hit back and then against a mob.
---
Ayy of course
---
yea patchwerk was a gear check we were not ready for
---
Upon further research, I'm thinking Seal of Command on Shockadin IS a good idea.
---
The combo is Seal of Crus -&gt; Judge of Crus -&gt; Seal of Comm -&gt; Swing -&gt; HoJ -&gt;Judge of Comm -&gt; Divine Favor -&gt; Holy Shock
---
It can make for some pretty strong burst that seems really strong.
---
Thats a quality straw man you've built for yourself, be careful around fire.
---
Thank you. One of the rare times, I truly learned something I've always been curious about but kept forgetting to ask.
---
yeah we only pay for it with leveling speed. fuck leveling pally sucks
---
You can but you gotta pay for each character you want to transfer. It's not free.
---
I leveled a warrior in vanilla/bc and (obviously) I tanked a shit ton.  Arms is your best bet in all honesty.  Something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/353053213020100021-05-552201) was a pretty legit spec that allowed you to even raid tank.  Not necessarily as the MT but as a good secondary or off tank.
---
Defensive stance and the normal defensive abilities your trainer sells you will get you by.  Sunder lowers armor, therefore boosting physical dps.  Demo shout reduces enemy attack power, so you take less damage.  You can interrupt casters, so you take less damage.  You get where I'm going here.  Use your normal prot talents to help you survive and you'll be fine.
---
Until you get to LBRS I wouldn't even worry about the prot tree at all or having tank gear.  Obviously you'll need a shield and a 1hander so keep those as current as you can.  Would having actual tank gear be better?  Yes, but it's not needed for 5 mans until you get towards the end.  You're leveling -- no tank or healer is going to have actual tank or healing gear or be full tank or healing spec.
---
At least it isn't all 6's.
---
my guildie said stamina is most important when leveling as a warrior, even moreso than strength. Is this true?
---
I'm terrified that they would add flying.  But aside from that I am all for Classic+
---
That's the real streamer privilege right there
---
Just commenting to say I’ll be moving from Incendius when this comes up...so that’s atleast one! 👍
---
Like when alliance players are passing through to go to scarlet monastery...
---
There’s always some noob screaming it out in chat like everyone’s supposed to rush over.
---
Lvl 36 Warrior tank who's hobbies include fishing, cooking, first aid, alchemy and herblism (all 225). Spend a lot of time tanking as I seem to get a bunch of /w everytime I log on. Nice building up a rep with the regulars.
---
I hadn’t played in over a year. I played on a private server for several years in college, so classic was an instant attraction.
---
Arms. Love it
---
Apparently the most efficient playstyle is to get the talents for mana regen after Drain Soul, and drain soul everything. Then have a macro or something to delete shards. 
---
Fuck that though I got improved lifetap instead.
---
Ridiculous as in there were too many people farming them.
---
I've only seen it once or twice on Skeram too. Really isn't a major issue IMO
---
I would contact a GM then.
---
Same
---
Lol I agree with your main point there but your argument is straight up nonsense.  I shouldn't have to point this out, but in case you forgot, we all started at level 1 exactly a week ago.  There's a pretty obvious difference between clearing a new raid in a week vs clearing a new raid in a week when you were level 1 at the beginning of that week.  And secondly, they cleared it in QUESTING GREENS, with a bunch of people who are not even level capped.  Sure, you can get about anywhere with 18h/day of playing.  But if that's where you get to in a week, then you shouldn't be able to clear a raid.
---
Sounds like bullshit, you have a link to the lowest pops servers having more than the biggest in vanilla?
---
I've seen the loot box flash up for a millisecond showing stuff to grab before the window disappears and I get nothing. Auto loot on. Odd eh.
---
Rogues dont want to fight like warriors in pvp because they are much squishier in leather.
---
Rogues are best at dispatching single enemies in the shadows with burst dmg. So assassination and sublety are your go tos for pvp. Warriors are best charging in like a hero and mowing down players like a lawn mower, if there is a healer behind them
---
I'm fine with this. Everyone else can fuck off, the streamers can stay in their own little bubble.
---
&gt; The beauty of Classic is that there are no limits to getting into new areas. 
---
That's a good point. Maybe leave leveling content open but lock the first raid behind Prestige (until X time after launch)? Looking for a solution that offers the big launch day excitement without extreme power creep and empty zones the way Retail is.
---
I've done the same thing here. People take r/classicwow very very seriously.
---
Believe it or not, you do not need to train everything your class trainer provides. Infact, for some classes (like Warlock) it is foolish to do so. 
---
Vendor everything. Loot everything. If you do enchanting, you'll take a hit in your pockets for disenchating - but in the long term, those mats are a solid investment.
---
Rely on your guildmates for bags. Do not buy bags from that guy spamming trade chat. I say this as a tailor. Don't. Buy. Bags. 
---
If you get a really good green or blue, consider selling it on auction house. Maybe spend some time familiarizing yourself with what may drop from a dungeon. Then, if a certain item ends up in your inventory you know it's a hot commodity, and should AH it. 
---
Raw mats are hard to sell on the AH right now. Give that some time. If you are hoarding mats, that'll be a longer-term investment. 
---
Be careful how much you invest in your professions. Being a flat broke 40 with 4 gold is... not where you want to be.
---
How many auto attacks did it take?
---
Is it me or was this a hidden PSA cuz someone got their kill stolen?
---
Pokemon Go has a large playerbase relative to any other mobile game.
---
It has a tiny playerbase compared to its peak. Dropping from 147 million active users to around 10 million is huge dropoff.
---
Idk why Pokemon Go fans get offended when the factual dropoff of players is brought up. Faded hype is not the same as a dead game.
---
Plays PvP to play PvE. Meta shit.
---
This but unironically
---
Trash mobs usually have 1-2 mechanics.. It's because there's different trash mobs packed into groups.
---
honestly i've been leveling a warrior and having a great time, though I am almost always grouping with people. I did herb/alch + first aid to be more resilient, I always make sure to have decent gear and cycle shitty old stuff out, and I do occasionally get my ass beat but the only complaint I really have is the lack of speed-boost spells that Mages, Hunters, Rogues, Shams, and Druids have.
---
Dungeon grind or do Ashenvale until I can do 1k needles
---
i see what you're saying, but this completely depends on the pull, sometimes you can spare the mana to use on blink sometimes you'd need that mana to get one final blizzard otherwise you'd have to evocate/gem, it's all situational really
---
Imagine being that mad at the internet you actually remembered an online vendetta. I had to reread the thread because I don’t even remember replying to it. Jesus lol
---
I don't care enough to let it bother me, but I care enough about pretty much anything and everything to squabble. I have a hard time letting other people have the last word. So I'll probably just keep responding to you long after I forgot what I originally was talking about. But don't worry about me, because this is literally zero investment so I'm not out much. We can go as long as you'd like. But the longer we go at it, the higher the chance that I might start to care about you.
---
You have to pay to transfer. It aint cheap either
---
See what you did there? This is about you.
---
I dont see how sound would help you notice any difference in time betwewn casts?
---
I named my poopsock retail wow
---
They.  Were.  Sub.  60.  In.  Greens.
---
they had to change it because it was impossible for people to wait until 3 sunders
---
Thank you. So there isn't a way to get it all in a single macro.
---
I will forget about it soon, its my main damage dealer atm due to my low level
---
Just want to point out so everyone knows . Joana the original record holder got this record by questing. Jokerd got his new record by power farming massive groups of mobs on a mage. Almost no questing. So I think that’s why it seems so drastic... jokerd and the community as a whole are just far smarter now
---
There is no good way to introduce new content. There are only two options to adding new content. 1: new expansions that raise the level cap and you end up with retail 2.0. 2: you add content to 60 that'll either get ignored because it's just useless side-grades or it'll lead to insane gear inflation.
---
People are talking about making side-grades that just make "meme specs worth playing" but there is no way to do that without tweaking talents. Only other way to do it is make it gear bound to a certain spec then give it higher stats than comparable gear. That wouldn't go over well at all. 
---
Then you always have the issue of what happens if the game just turns into retail anyway? This idea of voting only works if 75% of the game want to keep classic as classic. Sooner or later small little "quality of life" changes like flying mounts, mounts at earlier levels, etc will sneak through the polls. One of the bigger reasons behind mounts at an earlier level, BoA gear, and faster leveling came into the game is for leveling alts. Once the game is capped at 60 for so long leveling alts will be one of the main things to do and those sort of additions to the game will get requested more and more. 
---
The only way I'd be okay with it is if they kept classic servers if they added classic+ servers. The only argument against that is people saying it'll "fracture the playerbase" but they'll be plenty of people (like me) that will quit if classic+ is the only option so the playerbase is going to shrink regardless.
---
Why so early? The queues seem to have become a lot more manageable - is that only because they've had to rely more on their layering technology, and does this mean they're trying to take a more aggressive stance to phasing it out? Seems like an odd move seeing as one of their reasons for bungling the launch so badly was that they were trying to avoid needing realm transfers.
---
You can also see your weapon skill is leveling up quickly which will make it worse.
---
Our tank melted.
---
If I was a gay and my partner pissed me off, you bet I’m gonna call him one
---
On the flipside, as a paladin tank- cast it on me all day baby, save my durability
---
Thing is : if a meme spec is only viable once they clear content harder than naxx, how do they even reach that gear without being boosted or playing another spec ? Pretty sure these folks enjoy their meme spec and won't really like playing for months until they can finaly enjoy the game.
---
Not that it's a bad idea, but locking it behind the soon to be hardest raid in the game seems counterproductive.
---
friends who predate wow, will still be your friends even if you don't play on the same server as them. Especially, when you lead them to a server you can play on with out queues.
---
As a level 40 warlock,
---
Why was he mad?
---
I played vanilla but haven’t leveled in the world just got past stone talon, it was fucking stupid. I’m in 1k needles now, but the quests there are all spread apart too
---
That is never going to happen.
---
I had the same experience, except from Stormwind to Wetlands to reach Ironforge. This was during Wrath when I mind, but probably my most embarrassing and most frequently told WoW story.
---
&gt; I was always under the opinion that Blizzard do their best with the information they have so it's nice to see them finally get some credit.
---
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
---
explains why it hasnt dropped in over 40ish mobs ty
---
Good hate asmongold ever sense he begs for money and to get powers leveled
---
There might be something to the idea that the fear of getting a queue, prevents people from logging out when they otherwise would. But it has nothing to do with people with high /played. Even if they played half as much, prime time would still be prime time.
---
Hey, man. People like to play games for fun. Not everyone has to minmax every aspect of the game.
---
Great now turn off layering anywhere 30+. This is going to destroy the game every day still present it gets worse.
---
But would only allowing xfer to lowest pop realms stop people from wanting to xfer?
---
i play on a 2018 mac and it runs at about 30-40 fps on max. I tweaked a few things (mostly shadow quality tbh) and i get 50-60 now. However ive noticed that it runs 60+ on ultra in Windows.
---
Found the guy who thinks any of them are his friends.
---
That doesn’t mean that there isn’t easy better options lol.
---
I was so sad when my friends said they were starting an alliance guild. Always played horde before, never rolled shaman and was devastated when I realized again you couldn’t play shaman as alliance in vanilla. Ended up a human warlock instead, level 12 now after probably 12 hours
---
Just depends on if you want more DPS or life. Just do a mix IMO, 50/50ish. 
---
Hell, theres some warrior guides out there that say SPIRIT it the best levelling stat for warriors since once you break a certain threshold, your HP regen is insane.
---
I have accepted that my role as a tank in dungeons is to do my best to keep mobs off the squishys, and also give the bosses something to focus on. That's it.
---

Saw some dude running around with 3 or 4 priests multibox. Just tossing a bubble on him when needed. How fun
---
Because that wastes money
---
Maybe if you change your name to something other than mud.drop. your situation will change
---
You are wrong. And if this was sarcasm it was shitty too.
---
Level 20 you get your class quest for succubus. And you also get a 12 slot soulbag
---
*play this one exception in the 15 years of the games existence* btw I did play feral in wotlk. What I'm saying is it's not rocket science, all rotations are easy with at minimum some understanding and light practice
---
That’s what Bliz said about Classic.
---
Rogue and warrior have very different playstyles, both these classes have a harder time levelling being melee classes and having to face tank everything and not start dealing damage from a distance.
---
As you get gear from running dungeons especially weapons life gets a little easier and rogue being a little easier then warrior to level, warriors are knows to be the hardest class to level.
---
Your girlfriend's the smart one then. Love locks
---
I needed a healing dagger earlier because it had 50% more DPS than my current weapon.
---
No the reason IF AH was the main AH in early vanilla is it was literally the ONLY alliance AH when the game launched.  Orgrimmar was the only horde AH.  As Kroxywuff said they didn't add AH to all major city until a later patch (1.9).

Just opened it up quick on mobile and holy shit yeah a ton of work went into that. But the maps make sense with the colored path order and stuff but then it had circles for flight path, intentional death warps and such but those circles were the same colors as the path colors and there's shit tons of circles on the paths so I can't tell what those mean.
---
Wow. That does sound like a huge regression. Thanks for explaining.
---
I would get em just in case you come across something resistant to frost damage
---
Ist not even possible to balance that evenly.
---
When there are 2000 alliance players and 3000 horde players.
---
They could put for example 500:500 in a layer, but what about the 1k hordes left?
---
longer queue times for horde until more alliance players log in?
---
Yeah the hardcore raiders get there rocks off by being the first to do it... not because it’s hard. IMHO the famous jfk quote doesn’t apply here. And all these people posting about how easy the raids are... yeah there super easy if you know 39 other people who have been playing on private servers for the past 15 years.... I guarantee when everyone else starts getting into mc and ony the wipes will be coming hard. 
---
People seem to forget the challenge in these raids were mechanical challenges it was a time sink. You had to do so much farming before you could walk through the door, just because some streamers who do this for a living did it in a week... does not mean the rest of the player base will even be close to this.
---
Idk maybe I’m wrong
---
Lvl 40 warrior LFG for am Cath

WOW retired, 35 year old dad and husband. I have serious fomo right now.
---
The thing with leveling a warrior in this form is that you are SUPER weapon dependent. It's easily their biggest weakness for solo content. Other non-pet classes can get away with never caring about their weapon (cough-Druid-cough,) which makes them great at leveling, but with Warriors you really feel it when the content your playing against out-scales your weapon.
---
World of Warcraft Classic is not an option when I press on the pop-up for versions. Do I need to buy a sub for it to show up?
---
Nice I can use this to remind me to rebuff my blessings
---
I think what blizzard should do is offer these, AND have a guarantee that if a realm drops below X players each week then they will offer free transfers back to a populated realm.
---
That way players can choose to avoid the queues without fear of being on a dead realm in 6-12 months time.
---
u 2
---
Sorry their thought out business model aimed for the long term was inconvenient for your short term goals
---
Yep, same. When it's not arguments about "the left", "the right", or antifa, it's people screaming about vaccines causing autism. I have a huge ignore list just from questing in the Barrens for a few days. Even saw a person recruiting for a guild called "Hard R". Wondering if it's my server or if Barrens chat is just fucked now... I'm on Blaumeux, what about you guys?
---
That seems.. weird. And not as fun.
---
Did you pay the man?
---
"A Warrior thinks nothing of victory or defeat, but merely fights insanely to the death."
---
Why is the Human starting area have everything so much closer together (thus making levelling and questing so much easier) then everywhere  else. In the time it took me to level up my NE rogue to just level 5, my Human Paladin is level 10.
---
RemindMe! 2 years
---
Rushing to max level is pretty normal for classic and any expansion. Their rush to 60 shouldn’t impact your enjoyment of the grind, I mean, ride.
---
Technically a subscription cost can be broken down hourly.
---
I feel like a lot of raiding guilds went ally because it is know that side has overall higher dps.
---
Lmao truuu
---
Literally did that quest lastnight.
---
*'Oh I remember this quest! Should be some good XP :D'*
---
\*45mins later\*

*'WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE SLAYERS?!'*
---
I swear they spawn one by one until you're at 6/7, at which point a large group of the fuckers appears.
---
The twitch client absorbed the curse client in a merger and now handles addons for you with a library to pick from and install as you please. It simplified the process so a lot of people use it. If you don’t use it, then getting ElvUi will be the same as you’re used to.
---
very few people are going to take a person into a group or not based on their (barring maybe dwarf priests), so being undead doesn't matter. i'm a rogue on a medium pop pvp server and only once have i been turned away from a dungeon group because they already have too many rogues.
---
In 2015 I had a LVL 20 Elf mage. That my entirety of my wow knowledge. I want to be competitive but realistically I don't think I have the time. Ive been working since launch tomorrow is last day then days off.
---
 I have 3 hours game time and probly 10 hours in this subreddit and 10 more hours reading wowhead. I still can barely understand some people when they chat but I'm learning lol. 
---
 Y'all literally speaking another language with all the acronyms and what not.
---
Just wanted to say I agree 100%
---
Lvl 21 warlock. Had my voidy on aggressive by accident. He proceeded to pull half of the shipbay in the last room of DM...
---
Again I am so sorry guys.
---
what are you on? 25$ for an automated transfer is an outrageous amount of money. Why aren't you paying 25$ for an amazon shipment? There at least someone has to do anything? Or getting money from the bank. Why don't you pay 25$ there. If you don't think 25$ is outrageous for this kind of offer you are delusional.
---
Because internet points
---
I get both as a frost mage mainly because I have come across a couple situations where I get dispelled and my frost abilities are on CD for 5 or 10 seconds.  but it probably isnt needed but I feel weird not having it as a mage.
---
You get banned for AnimeTiddies? When there is a person on Stalagg named “Analsex”... LOL WTF
---
warcraftlogs isn't the end all be all for stuff like this (nothing is) but you can take a look and get an idea how bad it is.
---
That spec will be ok for lvling on a pvp server if you’re looking to pvp in quest zones. However it’s not the best talent point set up for lvling. Most go Combat for blade flurry and also you’ll be face tanking most mobs so backstab and ambush don’t help out too much except for openers.
---
This is referred to as Everquest mode to us old timers lol.
---
GW2 has a really good horizontal progression, something to keep in mind :P
---
Oh that should sell for a at least 5 silver at auction. Nice find.
---
Of course! Can't go back on my word.

There was a post on r/relationships last week, chicks gunna divorce her hubby because wow classic addiction was the last straw. Not all so much has changed.

This is the delay/pushback I'm talking about. On the third mob the wand speed noticeably slows down. The first two mobs are killed while I'm shielded so you can see the difference once I get to the third mob in the video.
---
Definitely and everyone has been really friendly. I've had level 20s help me with a few level 10 quests because the mobs respawn so quickly. Nice seeing a positive gaming environment for once.
---
What spec are you? What level?
---
They actually ship you both to an arena and you must duel to the death irl.
---
can someone explain please how mailing someone prevent them from deleting their character?
---
Feel like they have an extra Warrior
---
What about the name? I got my name on Shazzrah EU, but had to switch server because of insane queues. Obviously didn’t get my name on new server
---
Monkeynews was in half pre-raid BIS and the other half was close to it.
---
&gt;So what you are implying is that I should stick with my current professions?
---
There's nothing wrong with Herb/Alch, as a mage you'll always be running low on mana and have a small health bar. Some health/mana pots can be essential to survivability while providing good buffs. My mage in vanilla was Herb/Alch and I can say that it saved my ass more than a handful of times. 
---
Ultimately it's all a preference thing, mostly you can buy anything you need from the AH, but being able to make it yourself is usually more cost effective. 
---
&gt;Also, what is BoP?
---
Most green/blue/purple items are "Bind on Equip" (BoE) or "Bind on Pickup" (BoP), if they're BoE then you can pick up the item and sell it or trade it as long as you haven't equipped it. A lot of blue/purple BoE items are very valuable because you can trade them to other players or sell them on the AH.
---
If items are BoP, then as soon as you grab it, only you can use it (This is typically drops from dungeons/bosses). Bind on Pickup items from professions are usually exclusive items designed to reward players that have leveled their profession and found (potentially) rare blueprints.
---
He can if you type /PvP to enable it in home zones.
---
I’m level 35 right now and I feel like I’ve been no lifing it.... I have to go back to the real world tommorrow but I’m definitely just enjoying the journey.

For the alliance!

I work from home and it has never been harder. The fact I could load wow up on my netbook and just have it next to me at my desk and nobody would ever know or call me on it is just sitting there at the back of my head at all times.
---
The only thing worse than having to work instead of playing wow is being the only one who has the power to stop you from playing wow. I don't have anyone to hold me back other than myself and it's tough.
---
I'm not saying that! I'm on your side, bro. I have absolutely ZERO issue with you ghosting hands in public and ZERO issue with homosexuality being positively portrayed in public media! I think you should have the same rights as all straight people.
---
I'm literally talking about the fact that you and a lot of your community feel the need to bring it up when it has nothing to do with the topic or situation you're bringing it up in. 
---
Please try to do what you're asking me to do. You want me to be accepting, and I actually am! I'd like for you to actually take a chance to understand what I'm telling you. I fully believe you deserve a happy life exactly how you see fit, as long as you're following the law (the fairness of the law is another story). 
---
I am fully supportive of you. What I'm saying is that it should stop there. I already support you, as do many of the other people here that were angered by your post. None of us are angry that you're gay, we're angry that you brought it up out of nowhere and immediately took the victim stance before even the first reply rolled in. If you always play the victim, you're eventually going to have a victim mentality, whether you actually are or not. "You are what you eat" applies here. 
---
While I believe we still have a long way to go before the LGBT community sees the true acceptance it deserves, you live in the best time to be a part of that community and be yourself. Think about past generations. When someone was queer they had to hide it. You see more acceptance in a single day than someone 50 years ago saw in their lifetime. 
---
That's all I'm trying to say. I don't think you should bring it up when nobody is talking about it, and the reason they're not talking about it is because it's not a big deal anymore. Maybe you feel that, because people are silent, they don't accept you, but that's far from it. People don't talk about it anymore because it's become that mainstream, it's become accepted, it's become *normal*.
---
I accept you, man, and I'm sorry for the true adversity you have faced. However, what you're seeing in this thread isn't adversity, and it isn't hatred of your sexuality. This is simply people that are tired of being reminded of something they already accept. 
---
I hope you take some time to reflect and maybe see what I'm trying to tell you. I hope you have a good day.
---
Lmao it's a red vs blue reference
---
What if by doing deadmines you got smite's hammer before completing the quest? Seems like the strength would make up for the minor decrease in damage.
---
Shhhh, don't ruin my ecstatic fantasy of ignorance.

This is what I'm waiting for, dual wield, I'm lvl10 with a two handed that takes 3.2 secs to swing...

There's an innocuous enough looking quest for Horde in Hillsbrad called [Humbert's Sword] (https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=547/humberts-sword#comments). I saw someone in zone chat looking for more, so I figured I'd get it out of the way with some help.
---
Well it involves killing elites in a dwarven bunker/stronghold in hopes of finding Humbert's Sword amongst the drops. Annoying enough, but the respawn rate means that as you make your way in you are sealed in by a wall of dwarven baddies. They *will* respawn on top of you, they *will* run in fear at low health into even more of them, they *will* chase you halfway across the zone because they don't leash.
---
Along the way during our dwarven slaughter to find his sword we first found [his pants](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4723/humberts-pants), which seemed to be put in just to taunt us.
---
After killing probably close to 50-75 elites it finally dropped for us! I felt it was important to take a group photo to commemorate the moment and our new found friendship (the dead spider also wanted to photobomb us).
---
Yea and they didnt pvp much until cap just like now.
---
I dont get why it bothers you so much that streamers are leveling through dungeons
---
It would definitely help. Hard to tell how much. Many people in my guild use apps to stay logged in. They monitor it at work / school, and actually play the game many hours later.
---
My guess is that afk "bots" are compounding an already existing problem. It's why my current conspiracy theory is that Blizzard restarts the realms at 10am most days to purge AFK players.
---
 You don't need to be Prot to tank Raids, almost no-one specced Prot until the talent changes, around AQ time. 
---
The most common "Do everything" builds were 31/5/15, or 31/3/17
---
Eg.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023050213520105011-03-502301105
---
But of that Defiance is the only thing that'll make a noticeable increase to your threat. There's no issue at all with going for a classic MS build and I'd heartily recommend you try it out, you can tank just fine with it.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023050213520105011-55000104005
---
If you PvP you'll find that after you've gotten used to Piercing Howling during charge, it's hard to go back to relying on Hamstring. 
---
For leveling, as I said, pre40, I think something like this would give you some value:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/05004-5500013100501
---
Aiming to get TM around lv30. Or, if you don't value TM just go for Flurry. Either way, you'd be respeccing at 40.
---
Have not played too much because of  obligations. 
---
But..
---
 i was in the valley of trials with the circus that was launch day. At least 30 players running around in your field of vision at one time. 
---
I was killing some scorpids to get the quest item, i hung out with an orc shaman for 30 mins grouped up and alternating scorpids. 
---
We're still friends
---
I could almost swear GMs are spying on random groups making this shift happen
---
Of the same class :( lol. 
---
Not a terrible thing I guess but mreh.
---
I'm guessing it's a Horde thing than. Alliance definitely don't call it VC. Probably because it's our first dungeon.
---
I made mine. And I used examples. You just said they did a pretty good job. Who sucks at arguing here?
---
I'm at about the same with 210 skinning 180 herb and 125 fishing
---
Damn  u need  rolled  something u  wanna  sell?
---
You can always take a break and go outside or something.
---
You cannot reveal the best server.
---
Nobody will see this, but whatever. I'm plodding along at level 14 on my priest. I can barely do quests my level, but that's okay. I've relearned kiting pretty well. I can kill 2 mobs but not 3 at a time. I rez people I see dead on the ground whenever I see them. I sign everyone's guild charters. I like soloing.
---
Now that's some good satyr
---
Vomit up the blood of Jesus, for he must be crucified. No rest for the believers.
---
Int and critical strike chance are great, but I wouldn't discount spirit if talented as a priest or druid. Fifteen percent may not sound like much, but it's better than zero if you're casting or fake casting.
---
Right above play for retail you can choose wow classic.  It will install that version for you.  You will need an active sub to play classic.  Have fun!
---
I'll come out and say it.  If you haven't hit level 60 you don't deserve to vote on anything because you don't even know what the entire game has to offer.  I don't care if you've been playing 4 months.  If you aren't 60 your opinion doesn't matter because you don't have the experience necessary to make an informed one.
---
Thankfully I have a bad case of Alt-aholism. My warrior rolls out with a bag full of potions and the best armor Blacksmithing can supply. Takes the sting off a little.
---
Correct
---
Always stealth through them so they get the stealth sound, have a quick heart attack, then help.  :-)
---
2h as much stronger while leveling. I don't know for dual wielding, but for 2h axes are perferred because they have an excellent progression of well itemized 2h axes, starting with corpsemaker at about 30  when you can start getting axe specialization.
---
Lol how I have 25g
---
That is fair but one would think they had access to the numbers for reservations. I'm just glad I didn't take off work like others did.
---
Rogue was what I played in vanilla, and I really don't remember it being that bad. Like you couldn't reliably fight more than one thing at once, but you nuked stuff solo. The added benefit of being able to 1v1 pretty much anything besides Druids in PvP was really nice as well. 
---
I'm playing a Druid now, so I might just be totally wrong, but I don't recall leveling and solo content to be all that bad.
---
Yeah, if you are alliance.
---
Thanks for this haha
---
Hello, for an arms warrior what stat should i be focusing gearwise? stamina?
---
Just turned 20 on my Druid the other day. I’m taking my time and just enjoying the experience.
---
Faerlina
---
Whitemane
---
Definitely getting them.
---
If no one is telling them, then how can they feel pressured?  Are they really that insecure that they can't watch a streamer level without feeling like their world is ending because they don't play a fucking video game the same way?
---
I really can't understand how that feeling of anxious insecurity could be felt by so many people that they need to make a post every single day, upvote it until it's on top, and spend money to gild it.  It's just insane.
---
If you look on the left screen its not there, just retail version, do I need an active sub for it to show up and install?
---
pretty much
---
So can you spam this macro or will it stop your current cast?
---
It's already not vanilla because it's 1.12 talent trees.
---
You should still get the option to install classic even if you're not subbed.  You'll be able to start the client and it will tell you a sub is needed, so it's definitely not because of not having a sub.
---
  I am subbed and have been for a long time, and the same thing happened to me when I tried to start playing classic.  The way I fixed it was to uninstall WoW and the battle net client and reinstall battle net when this was done.  This gave me the option to then install classic where it was previously missing.
---
  Don't ask me why it did this because I really don't know.  But that was the fix for me.
---
Key ring is supposed to come with phase 2 patch.
---
Sunder armour. After 2-3 stacks you should be fine. Make sure your the one to get the pull as well.
---
Doesn’t matter why it was flagged, that’s the reasonable explanation, you’re the one looking to stir shit up.
---
And thusly your aoe burst shall FINISHTHEM!! and no one is complaining about threat!
---
I create soulstones as often as possible, because I have the thing that makes me get mana back at an enhanced rate for 10 seconds after kill.
---
Elwynn chat was the same for me on launch day. Not much in the way of silly trolling in the style of the OP pic, more along the lines of racism, transphobia, "TRUMP 2020" every 30 seconds, circlejerking about how awful BfA is and how shitty of a company Blizzard is, and one guy who was adamant that he'd done the research and found that depression can be overcome by just not being sad and that you're doing it wrong if you take medication for it (he was either sincere or a dedicated troll cause he went at it with me and a couple other people for like 30 minutes, even posting links to his sources).
---
I tried for a while to just import the original pastebin  [https://pastebin.com/9cfg9Nkx](https://pastebin.com/9cfg9Nkx)  info directly below  what u/MonteReddit originally posted.

I found the issue after u/MonteReddit posted the fix here.  [https://pastebin.com/Mt5hJV4A](https://pastebin.com/Mt5hJV4A)

Fresh install of Handynotes addon. Then modifying the Handynotes.LUA and just pasting the info below

1. HandyNotesDB = {

2.     \["profileKeys"\] = {

3.         \["%CHARNAME% - %SERVER%"\] = "%CHARNAME% - %SERVER%",

6.         \["%CHARNAME% - %SERVER%"\] = {

Pasting below the above lacked a bit of code instruction and would cause a error. It needs the profilekeys Like thus I think.

So long and short. It works. Thanks for this.

Im buying 1-300 kits over the next few weeks progressively buying higher tier stuff as the curve of players hits those points, currently you can do 1-240 on my server for about 10g.
---
In vanilla I used to buy them for about 50g and sell them for 100-150g, got my epic mount that way because some people are lazy enough or in enough of a hurry they'll just buy everything in a few trades Vs 100 auctions.
---
I'll tell you. When you spend enough time on your computer waiting for jobs to spawn, your brain is fatigued. So I took a snapshot to instantly share on my snapchat, to skip many steps of saving the screenshot, and moving it to my phone. Now, some hours later, I decided to upload it here.
---
Regarding the picture itself, the quality is fine, much megapixels, good camera, clearly understandable. The angle of the picture is meant to show only the area of interest and disregard whatever is around it. Overall, no one had trouble understanding the scenario or reading the picture. So I am safe to assume its fine.
---
That is for retail. You need to have an active WoW sub to play classic
---
How in the world. I had about 85g when I hit 40 on my rogue. Never trained any abilities that I don't use in combat, never bought anything on the AH, never even bought food from a vendor, plus I had skinning and skinned every skinnable mob I came across. I still had to grind a bit to actually get my mount once I hit 40.

As a human warrior should I pick the Axe or the sword ? As I have +5 in sword with the human passive

I been playing the new WoW since 2008 only at level 45 roughly.
---
My favorite is when you're still 6000 in queue and it drops to 1 minute. Like how can you be THAT wrong?
---
So long as you're not concerned with being the best and the fastest it's a very accessible game.
---
You'll miss minor things like a good quest line that requires you complete quests in order in three separate dungeons, but there's always alternatives. Get an item that's 90% as good somewhere else, grind some mobs for XP, do an extra questline to make up the XP.
---
What it takes to be a good player though is very accessible. The game is ancient now, and there's a million and one guides for every class.
---
If this was the Blizzard of 2006 then yes i would definately say yes to more classic content, however truth be told i just dont trust 2019 Acti-Blizz to create new content faithful to vanilla.
---
they didn't up the number of layers they up how many people can be online at the same time.
---
the issue is that you still have 12k people sitting in que for shazz even with layering and at this point people are not just making a new character on an other realm so they must give people free realm transfers if they hope to remove the que times before layering is removed.
---
But consider this, you moved to avoid the queue, and fell behind as a result.
---
But the people still in white mane had to deal with the queue, and lost some playtime as a result. 
---
So in the end both of you payed a price. If they are ahead of you when they get transferred into your server, consider that they got ahead even when they had to deal with a long queue, where as you did not.

Hi, /u/konstantinox

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czctxq/i_want_to_pally_but_am_concerned_of_gear/). 
---
Yeah I second this. I logged on at 535pm on launch day and played from minute one. 500+ visible people in the starting zone but everything was super smooth and I was at Thelsamar in 30m
---
honestly you are way over thinking it , if you have a sword/mace/fist weapon use sinister strike (which you dont have a choice anyway for questing). in dungeons where its a bit easier to backstab just equip the dagger and play normally
---
you dont need to keep swapping weapons like that
---
Bought a sub, and it popped up, so kinda scummy stuff but is what it is
---
Don't forget the other one, Magical Torpedoes.
---
It has been nothing like release, probably because of layering. There were Hillsbrad battles with dozens and dozens of players. STV was a total warzone and horde and alliance would trade control over Nesingwary's camp with blood. It was chaos. 
---
This time around everyone is rushing to 60 and no one wants to fight. Horde and alliance are peacefully questing together. It makes me sick.
---
Hmm yes I agree
---
The 500 IQ play is to not switch if you play on a highly populated server, because no one will switch to yours and people on yours will leave.
---
She now wears the mail leggings in the family it seems.
---
I haven't even figured out what I want to level yet just been trying out different characters.
---
I don't want classic TBC. I'd rather have new dungeons, new sets, and new battlegrounds, and new pvp rewards (maybe spec specific) added to Classic/Azeroth.
---
&gt; Which brings me to my next point. Apparently, the best in slot armor is Bloodvine and you can only obtain/wear it when you have 300 Tailoring so missing out on that would really be a disadvantage if I am correct.
---
That's right, you need 300 tailoring to use them, and it's a really good armor set - but it's not the best available by a longshot.
---
I believe you also need drops from Zul'Gurub to craft it, which don't exist in this version. So by the time you can actually craft this set, you likely would have found something much better.
---
One thing to note is that the later instances like Dire Maul/ZG/AQ etc added a bunch of better items available at level 60, in this version you are limited to what's in Scholo/Strat/MC/BWL/Onyxia/etc. 
---
&gt;Not that I mention it, how does one Mage really upgrade his gear apart from raids and dungeons? 
---
Raids, Dungeons and Quests are the best bet to get new items, long/difficult quest chains usually have the best rewards.
---
Other than that, random drops or buying from the AH is the only way to get better equipment. 
---
&gt;My armor is really old and half of it has broken down :/
---
Make sure to repair your weapons/armor often, you need to talk to specific vendors that can repair.
---
That’s the main reason i stopped playing retail, it feels like a constant race to get better gear, i felt forced to play everyday to keep up.  
---
In classic i can go at my own pace which is much more enjoyable.
---
can't join join chat channels from other regions? or am I crazy
---
incendius isn’t that bad man why you leaving
---
Turning 35 this year. No kids. Stable job. Level 21 undead priest. Suck it, world.
---
&gt;It’s a dumb mindset that the new servers will be ghost towns.
---
Ah, I remember my first MMO launch
---
Both arms and fury are better tank specs than prot pre-60. 
---
Prot gives you survivability, which is not an issue while levelling. 
---
Arms and fury gives you damage/rage which helps you keep aggro, and that is the main issue you should worry about while levelling. It's often good to use a two hander while tanking too for example, just for extra damage/aggro.
---
Oh to start with sure, but for a good chunk of vanilla there were other AH's that simply didn't get used because nobody was near them.
---
That said before they linked them you actually could get some really good deals off the other AH's from people who didn't know better.
---
Yeah, like why didn't we team up with a bunch of copies of Jaina, Khadgar, etc?
---
I'm not an ar-tard...
---
Because to some of us who's played vanilla for years, leveling *is* torture.  We just want to hang out with our friends in raids
---
Agreed, there are some special people out there!
---
Play on another server and avoid the que?  Blizzard warned everyone, and they're offering free xfers to lower pop servers soon. You have options.  
---
I'll agree that blizzard should have had more servers up earlier.  I had to start off on Thunderfury.  Now half my friends have moved over.  Best thing about classic though is I've met some cool people questing.  I haven't made friends in retail wow since wotlk I think.
---
yeah i love waiting an hour for my hearthstone. cutting the c/d really ruins the game /s
---
Keyrings were late vanilla, and were getting them when phase 2 patch is released.
---
I've only ever played to lvl 30 in classic, and I'm now at level 25 and planning to go further than 30. I'm playing mage on a PvP server, and I've seen some comments say that 'I wouldn't risk being an AOE mage in a PvP server'. Why is that? I know about the contested zones but I haven't really seen many hordes at all. 
---
Do you need to go to areas later in the game where you'll actually have to battle other players constantly if you're following the 'regular questline'? Currently have a pretty balanced build, but was just wondering.
---
The 50% attack speed one right?
---
Well i was more or less thinking about bosses requiering specific mechanics that were only made available in BC or in quantities that vanilla class kits can't deal with (too many enrage to dispell ?)
---
Things changed a lot over the course of WoW between MC and Sunwell. I doubt 1.10 classes have what is requiered to deal with a scaled down BC raid, and if you have to redesign the encounter why not just make a New raid for classic + ?
---

---
Yeah I'm one of those "friends" you stopped replying to. Have you even checked your texts in the last week?
---
Worth it to try selling potions with lower level alchemy or just level it up first?
---
Classic and Vanilla had a lot more linear power curve between 1 and 60, because 60 was thought to be the max lvl at the design process of WoW, they didnt plan ahead. 
---
Once TBC shipped, they needed to make 60-70 more exponential (for example, if you had 4k HP at 60 but you reached 20K hp at 70, whereas 50-60 hp difference wasnt this massive and lesser levels neither).
---
This set a precedent and thus succesive 10lvl gaps also became exponential. For example I remember being okay with doing 400dps as a Rogue at  T1-T2 content in Vanilla, but remember doing 10K dps in Normal 25 naxx just 20lvls later. That kind power creep is insane and IMO it felt meaningless to acquire max lvl loot at a certain point in the game, knowing next expansion comes up, that hard earned (less hard earner over the years, i know) loot was going to be replaced with next expansion greens  when levelling.
---
On vanilla you feel 2dps upgrades meaningful even at max level when raiding, because you know that gear was going to stick for a long time. The predictability of succesive expansions IMO killed a lot of the joy in getting gear, thus killing also the joy in doing the content required for you to get that piece of gear.
---
Let's try not being a child for a second, by worrying about everyone else...

I had to move yesterday and I won't get Internet here until Thursday, I'm dying from lack of wow

As you level I’d take whatever has the highest top end damage and mainhand that. Swords when possible, **especially** if you’re a human.

Clothies gotta stick together, even across factions. This is how I always play. If I see another clothie in trouble, I help. If he's Alliance and decides to gank me after, so be it. The Brotherhood of Squishy demands my attention.
---
I just got it last night. So good! Best part was the group deciding to not finish BFD after our combat bug and wipe in the altar room.
---
No fucking expansions. No flying please for the love of God.  
---
Tune the content for level 60 and release Azeroth stuff in classic. Karazhan, Caverns of Time, Arenas. All that content is fine. I just don't want the grounded world feeling of Azeroth to disappear into the sky again!
---
who records their lvl 10 wow classic gameplay and uploads it to youtube?
---
Someone put the pirates of the Caribbean theme over this.

Nice one! This has been my experience too, my gf loves card games and board games that had rpg elements in them anyway. 
---
Every day she messages me when she finishes work that we’re in the queue ready for when I get home.

I was a bit worried she wouldn’t like it, but she’s been loving it so far.

---
I like the way your thinking I’m glad people are starting to open up more and more to these ideas, this is how I think it should be done to preserve classic and fix he problems mentioned above and some of the things your not thinking about.
---
You knew you were going to get in trouble for an overtly political name like that. There was a guy on reddit a few days ago complaining about how they made him change his name “notracist”.
---
It’s pretty clear to me these names would be a problem, blizz does not want people invoking partisan politics into their name.
---
There are plenty of names that are bannable that slip through the cracks, the best you can do is report them and hope it catches up with them like it caught up with you.
---
Hey there,  
---
When leveling you should take a few things into consideration before weapon type (at least early on before talented weapon specialization) 
---
* Weapon damage- Top end
---
* Speed - Slow weapons for 2 hander, fast speed for off-hand while dual wielding
---
These are by no mean all the limiting factors, but help as a good starting point.
---
A slow 2 hander has significant damage due to the weapon damage normalization. Your big 2h weapons will be best off slow speed (higher than 2.8. slower the better)
---
Fast speeds for offhands help with rage while dual wielding. I don't know the math for DW, but you can most likely find it with a quick google search. There is a LARGE % of miss rate for offhands, be wary.
---
Ok, that bit out of the way, here's the real rub while leveling. 
---
*Take the best you can get.*  
---
You need to level, and you need a good weapon as the warrior is more gear dependent than most (looking at my fellow hunters) and the weapon is the tip of the spear.   
---
I say take the best you can get because you're leveling. Today's amazing rare weapon could be obsolete in 2 -3 levels. It helps getting you there, but don't spend lots of cash on them.  Find an instance that lets you farm a good one (low level Corpsemaker in RFK . its a lvl 29 req.)
---
I went DW for a level to see how it'd do. Mostly because all I had worth a snot was the Wingblade (quest reward from WC) and another offhand that was fast. I even went Sword and Board for a while. (it works. but isn't exciting)
---
As far as what weapon types while leveling? This shouldn't play into it too much, but if you're an Orc, you have +5 to axes. Human, you have +5 to swords/ maces.  While leveling this won't play into much.  
---
Mostly, just enjoy. 
---
\- Blood and thunder.
---
I bet questing is so much easier when the mobs can't see you!
---
Just to undercity though right? Lol
---
Their job is to waste their mana because the lock didn't want stock up on food or water?
---
Me and a 35 rogue were able to everything except the last boss.  We paid a level 29 priest and 31 paladin to come help us kill it.  Money well spent.
---
probably leaves items and more in limbo and has nothing in place as a backlog or is not able to have anything fit in place.
---
Heh I don't remember that at all... but yeah it has been a while. But as a general rule you couldn't transfer to PvP from PvE, otherwise way too many people would level up on PvE and then move to PvP which is rather unfair.
---
How about, people play fast or slow as long as they are having fun and we dont judge them?
---
So to clarify, free transfers will only be for characters in highly populated servers allowing them to move to lower pop servers?
---
Yeah but they aren't in PUGS homie...
---
On whitemane I was avoiding the queue via remote desktop. It was an annoyance but didn't cost me playtime.
---
We spent a long time doing these quests together, and no one left until everyone was golden.
---
"Spiced Wolfmeat anyone?" really got me lolol.
---
ten bucks says they at least push to level 70 with BC again and then merge the new and old storylines into some bullshit time warp opt-in expansion that brings the worlds together.
---
Plus layering killed the entire point of the classic server feel. Private servers, with all the bugs, were a better experience than actual classic due to no layering.
---
That's a very weird amount of people

Some asshat responded in Westfall General, “Don’t you mean DM/VC?”

If you’re asking that question, you know the answer
---
They can't add flying to the old world without replacing it with cataclysm zones.
---
TBC and WoTLK were already made with flying in mind, so they need it.
---
Try leveling as protection. I didn't know any better the first time around and that's what I did. It's like playing the game in slow motion while watching everyone around you play the game on easy mode.
---

VSync (also applicable to GSync and FreeSync) is not the same as simply setting your refresh rate equal to your maximum frame rate. The number might be the same, but your new frames aren’t rendered in sync with your screen refresh, so you’ll still get screen tearing. You need to actually enable VSync (or one of the adaptive refresh rate counterparts) to avoid tearing.
---
While eliminating screen tearing, VSync unfortunately introduces a small amount of input lag (not a huge deal in wow, but not ideal for gaming in general). Above 120 / 144 / 240hz, tearing is hardly noticeable, if at all, and so it’s worth keeping VSync off to avoid the added input lag.
---
Lots of in depth science on the subject here:
---
https://www.blurbusters.com/howto-low-lag-vsync-on/
---
Some people are more sensitive to screen tearing and some are more sensitive to input lag, so certainly experiment and see what suits you best.
---
It wont, classic sub money subsidizes retail expansions.
---
...and I discovered a way to defeat your low bid price scheme!  &gt;:-D
---
Nah, you don't need a 5 man group.  Had a 29 priest, 31 paladin, 34 warrior (me) and 35 rogue and we killed him.
---
Kirtonian here too, alliance. See you boys out there. 👹
---
Nuh uh!! Orange man good!
---
I see. Fingers crossed it works like they hope it will. In hindsight I suppose doing these transfers early will probably be less impactful socially then if they waited until we're all raid-ready.
---
Big brain plays big brain

He already got that experience in beta
---
What level are you? What times are you usually on? I've been leveling a rogue on Whitemane. Yes, queue times suck but it's better than ending up on a low pop realm.
---
this doesn't really make sense to me? I work in software. reusing a piece of code is not much different than reusing an idea, it's just a step further. rewriting an engine will use a lot of the same ideas (lessons learned from the past!) but that doesn't make it a 'copy' of the engine.
---
believe it--this information comes from a very reliable reliable source. Only an engineer that personally worked on the engine or the tech lead that drove the team to write it could argue otherwise
---
Good job!

I life tap to 20%, don’t bring drinks, and also don’t die because I know what I’m doing. As we said in Vanilla to players like you, QQ.

Yeah I have encountered a few bear tanks doing pretty well in the earlier level instances over the last week I think you might catch some hate from the warrior lovers but you for sure can get into some action

i spent the entire day today leveling proffesions from 60 blacksmithing to 130 from 50 fishing and cooking to 175 with all 225 gotten aswell i am level 22 and i will be good on the secoundary proffs untill level 45 (expect first aid but that normally gose pretty easy as you level)
---
there feels pretty good and time wise it wasn't that much wasted time.
---
I've stated this before multiple times on r/WoW. Garrosh is the most poorly written character I've ever seen. His entire character arc reeks of Chris Metzen and the other game's writers not having a clue what they wanted to do with him.
---
From his introduction in the Burning Crusade, he is sullen, depressed and melancholic. He blames his father for dooming the Orcish race until Thrall shows him Grom's heroic sacrifice, bringing his estranged son a renewed sense of hope in his people.
---
Then Wrath comes and he becomes an overtly aggressive warmongering asshole with a seething hatred for the Alliance; something which the game's lore does not justify at all. Garrosh was an uncorrupted Mag'har. He avoided drinking the Blood of Mannoroth because he was ill with the red pox and was left behind in Nagrand. His challenges towards Thrall's leadership were also uncharacteristic of him, given his previous disposition and upbringing.
---
Cataclysm was where Blizzard really tried to make Garrosh seem like a good guy. He chastises Sylvanas for using Val'kyr to resurrect dead soldiers as Forsaken puppets, then throws one of his generals off a cliff for ordering his men to drop a mana bomb upon a key Alliance town and kill innocents in the process. Then Theramore happened...
---
Mists of Pandaria doubled-down on Garrosh's warmongering asshole persona, and by the end of expansion turned him into the Orcish Hitler, where he had started imprisoning and culling other races of the Horde; particularly the trolls who opposed him. The Heart of Y'shaarj could have easily explained his change of personality but unfortunately, many of Mists' plot holes occurred before Garrosh even set foot on Pandaria.
---
Then the biggest problem yet... Warlords of Draenor. Thrall challenges Garrosh to mak'gora and breaks nearly every rule of the Orcish tradition. In violation of the rules, Thrall wears body armour, does not have a witness, and uses more than one weapon (the elements) to execute Garrosh. This probably explains why the elements are pissed off with him and won't respond to his call by Legion - which is why he relinquishes Doomhammer to the player.
---
If they dont wave back .. im gunna attack.
---
In true vanilla you could indeed do moonwalk, but you had to slowly tilt the camera angle while doing it otherwise your character would flip back.
---
My biggest gripe with "God" is that each religion is designed by man. Followers believe it is the word of God, or whatever, but you're just following the interpretation by one sector of people. With how insanely different the many religions of the world are, I think its ignorant and arrogant to believe that any one religion is true. I'm not saying nothing exists out there that we cant know about scientifically, I just hate how many fucked up problems come from religion and peoples' belief that they see things the "right" way.
---
You get levels from disenchanting stuff . Usually I get tailoring high enough to make Brown Linen Robes and DE those to get a lesser magic wand since I play priest. Then just keep DE'ing things you make from tailoring. Also, you can re-enchant things. For example, if your bracers have +5 health already you can enchant the same bracers for +5 health or any other enchant and you get leveled. A good way to make money is make and vendor/AH wands depending on your server market.
---
I'm pretty sure he's happy about people transferring into his realm?
---
You can't have both on a pvp server and that won't change in classic. Character restoration is a case by case bases.
---
Bonebiter is free on Alliance side.   
---
Ravager is comparable.   
---
It is definitely the best for a while, but it doesn't mean you need it. If you are 55 and still using WW axe, that is not a good thing. There are much better weapons. Anything from ulda last boss, gator axe from mara, zf 2 hander, and many more.
---
Surely they are going to open new realms for this? If they have transfers to the existing realms all that is going to do is make sure every realm has a queue. Smaller queues but still.
---
Warrior and Priest in my group both need a leather item then let me die at very end of VC because everyone in party need rolled a ring earlier and the priest was salty.

I haven't played for many years but I thought buffs did not expire but debuffs did.

Wish I could log into both at the same time tbh.
---
So far warrior leveling (questing, not dungeon spam) on classic is more difficult for me than private servers, mainly because hamstring kiting doesn't work because of the mob leeway. I'm only 32, and 20-30 for me has always been the worst leveling bracket, but it's been rough man.
---
I assume this was supposed to be a reply to someone?
---
Kharazan.
---
I would like a set that when completed among the bonuses would be a new ability that is class specific, like a legendary attack or gap closer, it would depend on spec.
---
lmao, but where's the chest?
---
Because that chat channel doesn't exist in Vanilla.
---
That's not optimization, that's cluttered with trash.
---
Fury having to take booming voice to get to flurry whereas arms can choose between maxing defelction, 2h weapon spec, and improved thunder clap is not really a feature of the fury tree. It's a negative. (and to be clear, while booming voice is not useless in pvp, I feel it's a LOT less vital than tactical mastery). 
---
There may be some argument towards the slam spec at higher levels, I haven't personally tested it. But having a shortage of decent talents is one of fury's big drawbacks, not it's strength.
---
I thought that repairing armor wouldn't be viable because of the constant loot fest. May I add you on [battle.net](https://battle.net) for further questions? You sound like a guy who knows his stuff and I'd me more than happy to join one of your games sometime too. I want to continue this conversation but continuing this thread furthermore would be an inconvenience both to the subreddit and me.
---
So are we able to see each other ?
---
Typically yes, but ammo is a thing again and in rfc I didn't have a gun yet.
---
I surely will send my thoughts and prayers...directly to their mailbox. I had to change servers 3 times because all three times a streamer made it their server. I refuse to play with these people.
---
Thought I was in the Warhammer sub there for a second.
---
You had me until the second paragraph.  These simple things you find annoying, I think most people including myself find flavorful.

Have a good time =)

Its quite obvious.
---
Most buffs and debuffs require the player be logged in, including resurrection sickness.

It's been a long while, but from memory that was when they *linked* the AH's wasn't it? I can't remember there only being one single AH at all.

---
Thanks, Had 3 friends on was a great time. We called it the classic!
---
;)
---
I didn’t know that. Thanks!
---
They are so cute!
---
You're overthinking it. It's a game from 2004 and the modern code is only slightly more demanding.
---
Hero to the masses
---
there's a useful addon called "item tooltip professions icon" that lets you know what professions use the item. Just hover your mouse over the item and it shows a little icon for each profession it can be used in. Highly recommend this.
---
Yo fam that's green, not grey.
---
Yes.  Also, if you want a free name change out of it, make a character on the target realm with the transferring character's name.  It will for the incoming character to have a name change.
---
Enjoy bending the raw arcane power of the universe to your will.

The Kurken (Is Lurkin)
---
nope :(
---
It may be removed now? I can’t find it, wow classic was in the title and it’s not showing up now. But! Go ahead and type world of Warcraft into the r/relationships search box, plenty of cases that serve the same point. I’ll check later when I have access to the desktop.
---
okay thank you
---
IKR i hate blizzard 4 doing this 2 me
---
Remove LFD yes, but I'm okay with summoning stones *unless* they provide some other way to summon players besides just warlocks.
---
Eg give another class the ability to send players, so caster + 2 people sends to a fourth's location instead of the other way around.
---
Would improve ability to assemble groups and add flavor without copying the warlock.
---
Thank you for this. I honestly didn't know and had gone through several dungeons without anyone telling me. You probably made my life as a priest a lot easier.
---
So instead of specific spots, they made it a radius?  Maybe that's why it wasn't in the exact spot I remember it being in... At this point, it wouldn't be putting me ahead by much to pick up some green worth a couple gold at a vendor anyway. Just thought it'd be sweet to get that jumpstart day 2-3
---
Go to 1k needles.  Spaced out mobs and they never end.  Pets take a minute to level back up to your lvl but should be fast with higher lvl mobs
---
Well, it IS Classic. It’s not Vanilla.
---
Thing is, its much harder to be negative when you're having fun, I personally don't have many criticisms of how blizzard handled classic, but some people might be blinded by how much they're enjoying the game to actually criticize anything. Still, I don't think Blizzard deserves much criticism regarding classic, if at all.
---
Yeah, I was leaving so much shit just laying there unable to hold it, not making the cash for it. Sucked.  Ponied up to buy 4x 12 slot bags and its sooooo good.  Totally was worth the investment.
---
Yep no worries man. Just keep anything you dont need to DE them instead of vendoring. For some items it is worth to vendor instead of DE'ing so you judt have determine what way makes more.
---
Hi! I would like to try classic out but i'd like to start leveling with a friend. I have played WOTLK a fair bit and i have some other expansion experience. I would probably like to play priest or maybe arcana mage. Dm me \^\^

My entire vanilla guild came back and I refuse to sit in a queue. Meanwhile, their excuse for not leaving is “we’re all 25+ and we have a lot of people in the guild now”. 
---
Fuck me, right?
---
I tried doing this from time to time while specced properly at 26-32.
---
I almost died just pulling every time. They snapped out of the Blizzard chill effect before I could get the next blizzard started. Someone always came out of the blizzard way before everyone else. They always reached me before my nova was off cooldown. I ALWAYS went oom before they died.
---
I respecced after that.

Guilds and mythic raiding are tied to your server.  You can group with anyone for anything else.  Still doesn't alleviate dead realms.  When a flask can cost 1200g on dead realm, potions run you 500g each.
---
Compared to my current realm where flasks are sub 500g and you can get 20 potions for like 1.5k
---
*ping* *ping* *ping*
---
What are the positives to being on a PvP server? I hear a lot of people complain about dying and people replying saying “well that’s what you get on PvP”. What are the positives that make this worth it?
---
Thursday Friday sat (my weekend), queue are stopping me from playing on my work days
---
I put up with it because when I first logged on, I found a mage, and tipped them 15s for more water than I could possibly use in a single session.  I am yet to find a mage unwilling to make me 200 water for 15s.  
---
They summoned me to the dungeon, saving me the time lost running, which would have been more than 15s.    
---
gl out there
---
Kromcrush represent!
---
We should start asking for repair cost deposits. "You wanna do cleave? Ok, give me five silver"
---
As you quest you will get harder monsters and quests will lead you to new zones.
---
Skeram came out before launch day.
---
Does anyone have a building path in terms of talents I can look at in terms of 2H?
---
The "new areas" aspect is the most interesting thing about the future of Classic for me. Like, would they rebuild Northrend to be more faithful to the vibe of Classic? Could they do a "demake" of Zandalar and Kul Tiras, intentionally worsening the graphics to fit classic, and completely retrofitting the quest lines? Or do they just simply add places we haven't been to before?
---
You need like one stack at max loyalty to keep your pet up. You don't need a full bag like you say... One for arrows is normal and you take less damage from mobs and lower repair costs as a result. It's not a 1:1 tradeoff, but the utility of having a pet more than makes up for the difference.
---
I literally waited just over a week to even start playing, and I am so glad I did. Seeing all the pictures of the crouded places and the lines, and the realm ques just made me anxious.
---
I finally started playing last night. The starting zone was still pretty packed, but in a good way. You could meet people on your ways and you weren't waiting for mobs. Played to level 7.
---
I can't be the only one who waited or is still waiting for things to calm down. I'm In No rush.
---
you talk to people or you talk to stranger?
---
It's a big difference.  
---
For how classic is structured, you need to group up and try to cooperate with others because the levelling experience is fucking harsh. Pulling an extra mob by mistake could means a 6 minutes ghost walk more often than not.
---
In retails you steamroll everything and the entire game structure is built around having the player being able to enjoy short activities. The average random dungeon last 20-30 minutes top.
---
The average Wailing Cavern in classic last 40 minutes. With the amount of people logging in classic right now,without any idea of how any of its mechanics works or even never having stepped in WC while exping in retail (because you blaze through the first 50-60 levels) I got a couple of run lasting over 1.5 hours and ending with people adding the others to friend list because despite the struggle, we were having a good laugh.
---
In retail if someone even just dies it could risk being kicked out of the party.
---
Let's be serious please.
---
In general, the Deadlines was predominantly VC in Vanilla on NA servers. This was from beta and probably was a holdover from EverQuest and maybe some other MMOs, where going into a dungeon usually required multiple trips, so VC signified a run in the Deadmines to the end boss. VC stuck and became the defacto acronym for the Deadmines. Despite this, some people remember it as DM on their NA servers, so maybe there were some outliers.
---
On the realms I played, DM was Dire Maul, and people usually differentiated its types with terms like "Tribute," so you knew what kind of run it was. 
---
My guess is that what happened on private servers is people in different regions (e.g., EU and NA) combined. As I have been told, the Deadmines was called DM on EU servers. Those players had never even heard of it referred to as VC. The argument, which is now an annoying meme, seemed to have grown from there.
---
Whenever I refer to the Deadmines now, I just type out the word.
---
I barely even paid attention to general chat in mine so not sure what the barrens was talking about
---
Calculating out the (real) DPS difference vs. the proc damage, it has to proc at least every 17 seconds (a bit over 3.5 procs/min). At the bow's attack speed, that's about every 7 shots (&gt;14.1%).  I searched a bit and couldn't find a reliable source for the proc rate, and the two empirical tests showed 12% and 20%, so it's unclear whether it'll proc often enough.  My suggestion is try it out for a while, see if it procs enough for you. Keep the old bow so you can go back to it if not.
---
if you stop arguing with me and actually look a this thread as a whole you will see I'm not alone in this idea, instead you're literally focusing one person and dragging it out. but have fun anyways in your classic journey. I'm done here :)
---
Here we go my guy. First I name reserved like everyone else. Then I rerolled when blizzard advised to (about two weeks prior to launch). Then, a day before launch, I rerolled again, based on blizzards suggestions. I rerolled *four* times I total, each time to a brand new server, recommended by blizzard in order to *avoid queues*, two of those being released *post-launch*. NOT Herod or any of that streamer BULLSHIT. Specifically PvP eastern realms. They were ALL fucked at launch. 
---
ALL of them. 
---
Nevertheless, players will be able to transfer, like we’ve been asking. So who cares what people like you think, anyway? 
---
Cancer.
---
*To be faaaaiiirrrrrr*
---
I never played horde and vanilla was before my time but all the stories about barrens chat were verified the moment i set foot out there and got bombarded with chuck norris jokes. Now the parrots remembered thunderfury exists, the shitposts are evolving
---
Was it bad or did you just not understand, y’know?
---
how do you check a pets attack speed? :o
