Why? Just pay the sub in gold, I haven't paid my sub since tokens were launched.

---
Help needed deciding between Priest, Warlock, Shaman, Rogue to level with my friend's mage. Thanks in advance! Would love to play with any of you when classic comes out
---

---
**Warlock** : when playing DPS i prefer to be a caster, and i've mained Mage in retail since MOP, so Warlock seems like the logical choice. My mage friend and i were even joking about running a port/summon service around the world to help make money at 60. Likely a great pvp duo as well.  My only drawback is the mage + lock combo will be competing for a lot of gear and may be tough to find 5 man groups together. If you dont start the group you have to hope they have room for 2 casters.   
---
**Priest** :  Even though i healed in vanilla originally, priest still intrigues me. Seems like a great leveling partner with a mage in terms of survivability, uptime, and group finding.  Also have the face melting shadow spec if i decide to PvP at 60. My only drawback is once again not being able to solo farm efficiently at 60 and having to rely on friends and guildies to get many things done.
---
**Shaman** - love the class fantasy and totem play style of resto and ele. Would be able to level as a ele/resto hybrid to keep us alive, help my mage friend with DPS a bit, and we are rarely competing on gear.  Also i'd get to be a troll without feeling dumb for rolling a troll priest and passing on the UD racials.
---
Thanks again!
---
I reckon priest or shaman. I'd go priest though, they're surprisingly offensive when shadow. Silence, purging, slowing can all be very good and useful. Alternatively you can go for a mixed PvP build which has healing and silence etc. 
---
I hope honour system is in at launch. I plan on pvping as much as possible while leveling and trying to get the pvp trinket asap.
---
I didn't know there was a world map for the first few days. I was running around Dun Morogh with only the North indicator on the minimap. "OK that big frozen lake is in the west..some npcs over there... trolls in between on the mountains.." until i got in comms with a friend and was impressed that he knew exactly where to go everytime. I felt dumb.
---
During wrath, wow was the biggest game in Australia and we all had 180-200ping so it's definitely playable but the jump from 50 ping to 200 ping is very noticeable once you've experienced both.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also I remember hearing that US &gt; EU ping is a lot lower than US &gt; OCE
---
Levelling as a Rogue is somewhat slow at the start, but around level 22 you really start to build momentum thanks to talents and abilities.
---
When you get distract, you suddenly become great with stealth, without needing a point in sublety. This allows you to get more points in combat which allows you to get riposte which is god tier, 10 energy for essentially backstack from the front which can use swords.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about raid spots, the real challenge is getting 40 people. You are a rogue, a competitive DPS class. If you know how to play and show up on time I reckon that will be enough in 90% of cases. 
---
I played it a little on the school computers, I was very casual.
---
Nah, intentionally making decisions that negatively impact others is the very definition of trolling.
---
Lava BRD runs where definitely a thing in Vanilla. I remember there was a jump that could be messed up, and it was a good bit easier with a Priest in the party.
---
It doesn't matter that much. For me personally, I hate all the dwarf special animations, 2 handed or 1 handed so I can't pick that.
---
However, their racials are good and useful. Lots of bleeds and poisons in the world. Plus lots of stupid 10 minute long diseases. Oh and treasure finding can be a nice little bonus too. 
---
I leveled as holy...so basically the same experience lol
---
Thought this was r/legaladvice 
---
Rogue seems more fun to dick around with honestly. Stealth runs, stealth shenanigans, lockpicking stuff for people etc. 
---
Wow it's like if Rogues could get along
---
I'd go Orc because I think they look cooler, but don't discount alliance. Lots of warlock players are scared by the whole undead thing but you're not going to be useless (A priest might be though). Mortal coil IIRC doesnt get broken by WoTF and you have things like sac voidwalker etc. 
---
Obviously if you can get the sub for free that way then this doesn't apply, that's saving 100% of the cost of the sub.
---
I'm talking about people who pay the sub like normal getting a percentage of that sub back through credit card rewards.
---
They will almost certainly not refund you. However, they might give you game time equal to the amount of time you paid for but never logged in. You could then freeze your subscription time and unfreeze it when classic launches for 2 years of game time. Open a live chat ticket and ask for both of those things. 
---
How do I upvote this harder..
---
Scholomance was designed as a 5-man dungeon that you could bring 10 players to. It was never tuned to 10 people. The unintended spawning of too much trash was separate from this. Once it was discovered, it was patched out. 
---
I knew a guy who had a warrior and dinged 40 but he couldn't afford his mount so he deleted the character because he was tired of walking everywhere...yeah...
---
I dinged 40 on my Warrior and was excited to get my first piece of plate. It had spirit. &gt;.&lt;
---
But have you read the 2004 game manual? My 9 year old self used to read that all the time whenever I was forced away from the computer, only fuelled my addiction.
---
Being a wannabe dps warrior in BWL, first time on Nefarian when my CO tells us warriors to offtank the adds and "use shield block".
---
Of course this idiot had the awesome judgment of asking a server of 40 peeps what "shield block" was.
---
That didn't go away for a while...
---
Well said. I will be pretty upset if there is sharding in major cities, or anywhere after the first 1-10 zone.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow

They’ve confirmed a few times just an active Sub. You need any other WoW content 
---
I have read in order:
---
Rise of the horde (45yrs before the first war)
---

---
Tides of darkness ( Year 3)
---
Beyond the dark portal (Year 8)

And im currently reading: Of blood and horor. ( year 19)
---
World of warcraft The game is around year 25 if I remember right.
---
There is books yes but there is also Short stories, comics and animations you can read/watch.
---
You put as much effort into your title as your image.
---
hey! thanks so much for the response, sorry to waste your time :P
---
What do you mean by viable? 
---
Time to stockpile them light feathers.
---
Happens all the time on K3. If you don't have a GFPP active you will see your healthbar randomly drop. That's from the eruptions.
---
I think the people who will reach 60 first will be people who are super hardcore and pserver players. I know Classic will be a bit different from pserver as in being more correct but knowing where to quest and which zones to hop between at certain levels will be a big help. We won't have to waste time looking things up because we already know what to do and where to go.
---
I definitely thought getting myself a full set of chainmail from the vendor was the coolest thing I could ever do for my pally... and may or may not have vendored everything else I had in the process
---
A decent leveling experience.
---
19 hunters are op
---
i personally enjoyed playing a 29 ret pally with Cobalt Crusher. When the weapon would proc with a White/SoC crit combo you could one shot somebody. Plus the slowing from the proc was nice for a pally, as it procced very often.
---
Lol
---
I've been watching Grubby stream again.  I am so happy to see him play WC3 again and he's so amazing I'm in love... *cough*
---
I will be watching Grubby while leveling up during classic launch.  :)

I would imagine there will be guilds that fit your needs. We're mostly all adults now and that makes me think that a lot of people will have jobs that require odd raid times. I know some east coasters will play on west coast servers because it fits their schedule better.
---
Name changes/server changes/faction changes are 100% community breaking . You’re correct, these are all under-discussed issues. Cross-server BGs I’m not a huge fan of, but I can kinda understand if these were implemented out of necessity at some point later on.
---
I'd see if they can apply that time to Classic. 
---
I remember eating a lot of canned soup and ramen noodles. Frozen chicken nuggets and pizza rolls. And juice, the kind with high fructose corn syrup and like only 5% real fruit. 
---
Yes. Gotta get that HoJ somehow without running the ENTIRETY of BRD.
---
Didn’t even have to click to know there’d be some super angst rock music. 
---
It’s not a WoW PvP video without bodies hittin the floor. 
---
Not op here, but for leveling a priest you basically mind last, swp and wand enemies to death. You can smite instead, you just drink more and go a bit slower. 
---
Even on pservers my guild always had at least one ret pally. It is another DI/pally buff/off healer/tank. You bring utility which is what will earn you your spot.
---
not so terrible for the pally atleast 
---
Way more than 10%. 16 rebuffs between 40 player is average 2 per player. A warlock alone can have five up each one. That’s before you think about rogues mages hunters priests and hybrids. 40 players could put up over 100 debuffs
---
That intro though.
---
oh yeah, i know but we would do it on the bridge to Shadowfang keep... so go ahead, hearth out... now you are a million miles from your destination and the rest of your group is at our mercy...
---
good times...
---
This is amazing. Should be a feat of strength in retail even.
---
Just saying, I’ve seen a server where the only grand marshal and high warlord around were locks 
---
My exp on pservers tells me people will absolutely gank during the leveling grind with or without honor system lol.
---
First time i whispered someone who was AFK and got the "Away from keyboard" reply, I thought he was trolling me. I keeped asking him why he tells me that and after about 10 mins of spamming the guy to answer my question,i realized that it was an automatic message.. I still laugh to this day thinking of him returning to the game and see all the bullshit i told him for no reason.
---
I actually did this once on my human mage! I remember thinking it was so incredibly hard I would probably never do it again!
---
What‘s happening there?
---
I did never play a Paladin or know of mechanics that can pull that off.
---
I did the same thing at first as well
---
You forgot to add the horde gankers 
---
I agree we will see people hit 60 very fast that have played hardcore for sure. But I expect a HUGE population decline when people realize how time consuming vanilla really was.
---
Corpse running back to mc/bwl so many times is still etched in my brain 13? Years later I could navigate it with my eyes closed. 
---
The average players who started post wotlk are going to drop like flies
---
The boss himself ain't that bad, it's all the adds that he keeps spawning that will fuck you up if you don't have the dps to burn him
---
Denial is hard mate
---
I never even played in Vanilla. I started in BC and only reached level cap on a DK in Wrath. But I have opinions 
---
I think you’ll find the opposite, when you’re at the top why stop? 
---
Check out the War of the Ancients trilogy. I remember reading it around 16 and it was pretty decent.
---
But, if u did it a sfk bridge, the pala could just bubble and run in?
---
I thought Elwynn Forest was the whole game. Finally figured out it was a whole world and wouldn’t leave Elwynn cause Westfall was too hard. 
---
60 Troll Rogue, named Hider
---
Had Dal-Rends swords as a combat rogue, using fast weapon in MH.
---
Also found Alcor’s Sunrazor and instead of selling it to a tank I equipped it because it had a damage proc.
---
Deep frost mage, marks hunter...
---
Fairly certain I played a holy pally with nothing but DBM all the way through black temple and Hyjal (never raided in vanilla though). I think I did pretty well without a dispelling addon, you just have to pay a lot of attention.
---
BC was still very demanding but the time demands of vanilla are going to surprise a very large portion of the people who are unaware of what it was really like to raid end game content when it wasn't already on farm 900 patches later or stepping into a guild with content already on farm for months
---
Rava runs are absolutely blizz like.
---
Rogue forgetting to stealth for hours
---
It will actually make rankings harder to achieve for the casual player due to the pvp structure of standings. The more games that are played while you work/sleep the further behind you get.  While I under your desire to pvp but understand that instant queues does not always equate to faster progression 
---
Ahead of your time.
---
Of what exactly? 
---
I believe some will stop playing for sure... but I don't really want to speculate how many. It is possible a lot of the post wrath babies will actually like Vanilla. Just because they are used to retail doesn't mean they won't really like Classic. The communities are vastly different too. That's what keeps most people playing Vanilla is how much you get to interact with other people unlike retail.
---
Yeah no, it’s boe, I’m rolling need. 
---
Both naxx and aq40 have been pugged on priv servers, however most of the players in the pug are benched members of top guilds on the server, so everyone has good gear and experience.
---
Op: it’d be great if I could find a place to have theorycrafting discussions. It’s clear this isn’t the place since people always yell about how I shouldn’t theorycraft, when I try to ask.
---
You: THEORYCRAFTING IS BAD. 
---
Do you like being a parody? The OP clearly isn’t here to be convinced. 
---
I started playing at 9. After having created my first character, played a bit and wanted to stop I've asked my brother how could I save the game. I did not understand how the game could keep my progress without hitting a save button.
---
Once, my keyboard changed to English mode (basically went from AZERTY to QWERTY). I had to contact a game master to explain me how to reverse it to QWERTY. I was so happy so I confess that I was only 9 and I ask if it was serious and if I could still playing the game because on the box age was like 12+. I don't remember his answer but he appeared before me on a raptor and in a ghost appearance. Nobody has ever believed me.
---
I agree it will surprise many but you have to assume some of them will enjoy it. They actually get to experience the world and the players in it rather than being max level in a week and only seeing your guild mates in cities. They will finally get to play in an environment where your reputation matters because you can't just q up for a dungeon/raid and act how you want because you will never see the people in that group again. For sure some won't like it but I am willing to bet a good portion of player will. I saw a lot of people on pservers who never played pre cata and even some who never played WoW at all before who loved it.
---
Sent you a PM.
---
&gt;There isn't much to talk about in r/classicwow ... the game isn't even live yet, so, a lot of topics are dull and irrelevant.
---
People don't have to post for the sake of it though. Id rather have less new posts in this sub than all that garbage.
---
I didn't have a computer good enough to record video on when I played, and making a PVP video just like this one is honestly one of the things I'm looking forward to most.
---
Fresh
---
LFD and LFR were implemented out of necessity too, why are they horrible but cross-server bgs aren't?
---
I really hope it's a huge hit and we end up getting a real good bc and wotlk server as well, with extremely tight knit communities, but I don't think the majority of people who started playing post wotlk will hang around long. 
---
But unfortunately I have massive doubts, vanilla was rough man. 
---
"No one will clear MC for 2 months except for the people that clear it before 2 months"
---
Did you even read what you wrote?
---
It’s true that your reputation matters and it’s going to be a rude awakening for a lot of people. 
---
That group you just raged at in wsg and made a fool of yourself, they are now standing next to you at the battle master ready to queue for another game but you aren’t invited. 
---
With Disc/Holy wouldn’t smote be main spell?
---
No armored mounts @40. All the basic riding mounts are unarmored and 60%. 
---
No clue whether there will be the unarmored epic mounts available or nor in Classic. 
---
My first character was a Tauren.. I thought you had to be honored in order to go to Thunderbluff because I read a quest wrong
---
not in vanilla
---
eu-german server sry ;)
---
but good to know those allys wont be save in NA as well xD
---
Might have been Ulda, definitely not rfk.  Healing rfk at 29 is not worth it.  I remember it as zf but I can't find any good documentation that supports level 29 level minimum for it.
---
I never heard of people requiring their guild to pug ZG on their own time. Even on pservers everyone ran it.
---
You're welcome to do research and try to provide evidence that private server content is different enough from how it should be to make a significant difference. Until you do you're just believing what you want to, regardless of the facts.
---
People aren’t going to take 2 months to figure out how to summon Ragnaros or take weeks to get to 60 for the more hardcore players. This isn’t 2006 anymore and you need to stop denying it. 
---
Mages, when those royal bastards charged up their ice barriers and mounted up to charge the bridge being guarded by those filthy alliance to do an AOE bombing run and break a hole in their defenses.
---
It was like a Jericho Trumpet sounding off.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCB8ZVxKqyI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCB8ZVxKqyI)
---
There were matched re-colors of the tier sets in TBC that dropped in raids. I forget what we called them, "off-set" maybe. That's still not very much progress though.
---
 
---
I logged in retail last week after skipping all of MoP to present and couldn't believe how stripped down the game was. I really hope blizzard gets this right, because vanilla was the best experience I have ever had gaming. I just don't see the current wow players being able to withstand the timesink it really took to get anywhere.
---
I hope I'm wrong and we get 100k+++ players but my gut says otherwise
---
Oh yeah the mounts don’t scale with your riding skill do they.  So only certain mounts are 100% and you have to vendor the 60% ones or just ride slow 
---
If it adds playtime to his WoW account, then it should count for classic.  
---
Vanilla was fun imo. I never thought of it as rough at all. I had a blast back in Vanilla and on pservers. I remain optimistic until proven otherwise. The problem with BC and WotLK is it may fragment the servers. Not everyone who plays classic will be there day one. There will always be an influx of players who wants to try it out. It may deter them if the servers are slowly dying because half went to play BC and half didn't. That depends if they force everyone into BC or not. Then you have the question of how many people just wanted vanilla and how many wanted to progress.
---
&gt; or the more hardcore players
---
He literally said it won't take 2 months for the hardcore people. He is saying for everyone else it will.
---
The issue is the gear trivializes the gear from other content, because it was released later in the game. It'd be like putting naxx gear in MC.
---
wrong, only one matters
---
I've experienced both, they aren't comparable.
---
Private servers are a joke man, now is that because 1.12.1 talents? Maybe. But most encounters on the private servers I've played are all broken in some way, like I said they are close, but not close enough.
---
I played plenty of retail vanilla (6 level 60s, raided through AQ) and I expect MC/Ony (and BWL too) to be steamrolled by any decent raiding guild. 1.12 talents, knowing the min/max meta, and just being better players with better addons and keybinds and internet connections all make a huge difference. Unless things are retuned Rag will be killed by guilds in blues and greens. 
---
Casual guilds might struggle, but that's because the hardest thing about early raiding in vanilla is herding 40 cats.
---
I ran an all spriest 3's team in bc with a similar idea.  3x mind blast into 3x sw: death.  If we all crit it *might* kill someone, usually just forced the healer to panic and overreact since it would 100-25 most people in 1.5 seconds.
---
We only got wins if we got lucky or were against a bad team, but we never felt bad about losing since it was such a stupid comp, so if we won even like, 1 in 5, it was still a blast.
---
If you weren't logging in during that time, there's a good chance they'll refund you.
---
Imagine this sub is a BBQ restaurant.
---
Someone else comes in and says "I am looking for a BBQ restaurant that serves Pork Ribs, clearly this is not the place because at this particular minute I do not see anyone eating Pork Ribs."
---
So I say: "This place sells tons of Pork Ribs, the majority of people come in here for the Pork Ribs. I believe that eating Pork is a Sin, so have fun going to Hell.
---
And then you say: "LOUD NOISES!?" because you're goddamned fucking retarded.
---
aoe / reflection tanking? :)
---
Tier 1 warrior gear has better stats for tanking than PvP Warrior gear.
---
Same goes for Druid, PvP Set does nothing for your heals.
---
So it doesn't really "break" much, as far as high level PvE goes.
---
I think he was casting wrath 
---
W8 I'm confused with your answer. So there will be no armored mounts @40? So we will have unarmored mounts with 60% speed?
---
This will probably get buried considering the size of the thread but here goes.
---
Back before WoW ever started holding your hand in any way, it was very easy to have a hard time finding things or figuring out how the game really worked.
---
I've posted this before and told the story to different gaming friends and my favorite "Oh, honey..." Vanilla WoW moment is still the time was when I was painfully leveling through STV and came across a human female priest around level 37 or 38 who was struggling to kill a tiger or panther or something. After I fired a few shots and finished it off, she thanked me and threw Fortitude on me. Then we started chatting.
---
She asked me how I liked the game and mentioned how hard it was. I told her priests are pretty hard to level, but pretty soon she'd get Shadow Form and pack more of a punch. She said she was getting bored with it and it was frustratingly hard to the point that she wanted to quit the game. I told her a basic rotation she could use (nothing fancy, Mind Blast into a Mind Flay or two, then Mind Blast, use your wand, etc). She said she hadn't been using Mind Blast, just Smite and Shadow Word: Pain, so she thanked me and apparently started looking through her abilities while I wandered off and kept questing.
---
About 5 minutes later she messaged me again and said she didn't get the ability, but went back to her trainer and it wasn't there. She said she had purchased all of her abilities. Then I noticed that my Fortitude buff was rank 1. I invited her to a party and instantly felt so badly for her.
---
Turns out, she had never changed her hearth from Northshire Abbey and had no idea that was even possible. She also thought that the trainer there was the only priest trainer.
---
Note for those who have forgotten: The starting zone trainers only teach abilities up to level 6. Nothing past that.
---
This poor girl had gotten herself all the way to the late 30s with level 6 abilities, other than Mind Flay. On a Priest... in Vanilla...
---
I quickly taught her about Hearthstones and how they can be changed and that other trainers had other abilities (I didn't even bother mentioning max rank abilities requiring skill books).
---
It blew her mind that there were so many other abilities and how much stronger her basic attacks had gotten.
---
It blew my mind that someone could have gotten through Duskwood with level 6 abilities. Imagine the ghoul rush at the cemetery...
---
Nothing I ever did in that game (even rolling on non-hunter weapons) will ever compare to that.
---
Hahahaha
---
 Somebody plays WoW differently than the way you play it. There is no right or wrong here. 
---
For Priest there is also mana burn
---
No, private servers invented everything cause we were all just bumbling idiots that clicked buttons.  /s
---
Yes, but doesn't even free time start counting down when they add it? Or will it not start until he logs in again?
---
That doesn’t add up. As far as I know, the ranking system is based on the amount of honor you get versus everyone else. So the quicker queue times don’t actually affect that since everyone would be getting more honor. It still comes down to simply the amount of time you spend playing the game. I understand your thought process but all the faster queue times would do is lower the value of each individual honor point and probably reduce WPvP by a lot. 
---
I'm Australian and raided on a US server because of my work, the ping wasn't terrible, probably around 140. It does depend on where in the US you are. 
---
When I played in an Oceanic guild we had a few American members there because of their work schedules as well, and I've never heard them complain. However almost every pug there's an American complaining about ping. I guess it's what you're used to. 
---
If you still play retail you could try joining a few pugs with Oceanic leads and see if the ping is bearable 
---
&gt;Username
---
Any chance you're a socialist gamer?
---
Dude I agree. I logged in to BfA and made a new character because I didn't want to resub yet. I didn't get past level 3 because of how easy even that leveling was. Also, I just don't like the new graphics compared to vanilla graphics. Pservers tainted me lol.
---
Yes 40 players could put up 100 debuffs if they wanted to. No, it wouldn't increase the raid's dps more than 10%. You have to remember we already have the 16 absolute best debuffs already up, and by then you're already talking very marginal ones like faerie fire/curse or recklessness. A single corruption or serpent sting would be like a 0.05 % increase in raid dps.
---
There will be multiple servers, though I don't have a list of locations &amp; PvE/PvP &amp; RP/normal options. I'm pretty sure that Classic will have a different launch option than retail so you won't accidentally pick retail instead of classic &amp; vise versa.
---
Oh, in case your first question was unanswered, I believe you only need to purchase the base game + monthly subscription. Classic &amp; retail will share a subscription, but you don't need the latest expansion (BfA). In case you feel like playing retail, the base game will include content/levels 1-110, right until BfA.
---
Yeah, it doesn’t seem far-fetched that there are 40 no-lifers who could take two or three weeks off work (or maybe have summer break), spend 5-6 days speeding to 60, then grinding instances for gear. It’s likely the hunters and locks will get there first, then turn around and help the other classes, who will then turn around and help the warriors.
---
Consider how incentivized they’d be to do it. Back in the day, you couldn’t boast to Twitter, IG, or Reddit about your world-first accomplishment. Now they can do that AND make revenue streaming to Youtube and Twitch.
---
It’s happening. 15 days max before a guild declares Rag is down, 20 at the longest.
---
Was there somewhere to get the felcloth gloves pattern before dm?  If not, those won't be in until phase 2.  Shouldn't be too long, but it's not like you can race to 60 and immediately craft them.
---
What the fuck
---
feed your pet 
---
I like the expansions idea, but your grips confused me. The core mechanics of the game don’t need changed, it just needs infinite content
---
&gt;Now tell us dishonestly
---
Ret paladins, elemental shamans, and shadow priests will be in high demand during Classic for raiding. The only thing in higher demand will be druid tanks for their ability to switch to any other role on the fly. 
---
I see people saying contact blizz to try and get a refund but one of the reasons, I assume, they force you to buy a sub and not a 30 day gametime only (unless using pre paid card/gold) is so things like this can happen and they can keep raking in money. 
---
@esfand
---
So anyone who plays Ret, Enhance, etc and is having fun is ruining your experience by existing. Got it. *Eye roll*
---
Any point you may have had is entirely gone.
---
Join the classic PvP discord my man, we have the best PvPers from all around the world there. Every class. 
---
This is definitely not the spot for that, I see people getting downvoted when telling facts and others upvoted when spreading misinformation here everyday.
---
Everyone here has naxx on farm and also hit r14 twice
---
Those taste so good!

How about 12 lots of corruption every priest dropping sw:p hunters using stings rogues with poisons item prices the list is endless. You can literally test this by running your own locally hosted realm and run 40 bots in various raid comps and test the different rebuff limits. The increase from 8-16 debuffs was already a huge increase. 
---
Six level 60s in vanilla? Glider was a hell of a bot in it's day man lol. That's a ton of dedication if you leveled all those by hand and still managed to make it through AQ
---
Yes 1.12.1 talents will make it much easier, but I honestly don't see 99% of guilds killing rag in the first 60 days man. Hardcore guilds absolutely. But getting that 40 player raid leveled, geared and keeping it together is gonna be the bigger challenge.
---
Shit was rough dude, if you really had 6 60s in retail you know the leveling and gearing was a massive time sink. RNG&amp;39 other players is going to be the real killer.
---
Kills quicker. Is less efficient after a bit of testing. Just get 5/5 spirit tap then do whatever the hell you want tbh.
---
If I was your DM, I'd allow this. 
---
Provide concrete examples and evidence or be prepared to have no one take you seriously.
---
I never hit 60 when I played vanilla. I didn't hit 70 until near the end of TBC.
---
Leveling **alone** was a massive timesink for most players early on.
---
Yeah back then I was eating potato chips, cookies, and hot pockets with Red Bull and soda.
---
These days I'm pretty much on the hummus band wagon. Gotta watch it when you get older. 
---
There were never armored mounts at 40. 
---
You’re right:)
---
im in the section of people who think only two matter.
---
I feel like r/classicwow will die down for a bit after launch. It'll get lively again after a while though. People will be too busy rediscovering azeroth and in some cases discovering it for the first time.
---
Being the 12 year old me and coming from runescape I had no idea what to expect as far as graphics. I downloaded the game and hopped into the world. For some reason the camera was set to a full on birds eye view, looking directly down on my night elf. I played for hours and days like this assuming that was the game, coming from runescape I was still happy with these graphics and style. It was until I accidentally drug the camera that my life changed....we ain't in Lumbridge no more
---
Elitestjerks used to be the spot
---
Lord of the Clan is worth reading , even if you aren’t a Warcraft fan.
---
Priest up to 40 regardless of spec is some combination of smite/fire/mind blast (depending on what you last upgraded or have talents for) + swp and then wand to death. Past 40 if you go full shadow you're just limited to mind blast/flay/swp but either way it's not a huge difference. You might be talking a 10% difference in levelling speed either way but it's essentially the same thing. So yes, it's viable for levelling. A lot of people prefer it to shadow even.
---
LFD and LFR were by no means a necessity, that was just a design decision Blizzard decided to make.  Also a decision that came after the time period we are referencing now. I don’t agree with it and is one of the main reason I quit the game.
---
Cross-Server BGs WERE implemented during this time period however, even if only at the end. Again, not a huge fan of them as previously stated, but it is a possibility considering it was in Vanilla. 
---
I am 100% down with no cross-server anything, but I would give up that one point to ensure no Name Changes/Server Changes/Faction Changes if I absolutely had to make a choice.
---
Yup. And even young people can develop a DVT and die if they have garbage luck for the day and roll a 1/ 1million
---
Who wants to be the one guy who died on launch day because he didn't stretch his legs? Not me.
---
Nice video.  Gratz on the AQ mount.
---
Yeah pretty sure all felcloth patterns could drop off of satyr in felwood.
---
Trust me, there will be guilds that will have 40 people ready in roughly 1.5 weeks. I know one guild leader that is set to go with his people and that's in my tiny circle of friends. He's betting on a MC clear in roughly 2-3 weeks from launch depending on how Blizzard does it with spawn rates of herbs and all that.
---
"I played it and I felt a difference" mate you played vanilla 13  years ago stfu you have no fucking clue what the difference is.
---
guilty of this one too on my paladin. I thought, surely, polearms would be the best weapon
---
Though it is possible that players who are used to retail and having loads of bag slots would put a premium on bags and would pay more for them. 
---
He's hunters marked
---
Make the "do it with 40 people" shirt a lot more sexy and I'd be interested 
---
Sure! But, it will mainly be viable only while leveling or grinding. At 60 you can get creative with discipline builds but you won't be doing nearly the same damage as a shadow priest -- because shadow form &amp; other talents are just that good. Most discipline-holy hybrid builds are for support, with *occasional* burst damage, rather than pure dps such as a shadow priest. But as support builds, disc/holy priests are very strong, can likely raid and pvp with the same talents. I think you'll see a lot of those builds in high-end pvp groups.
---
While levelling, pre-level 44, most min-max priest builds want a mix of disc, holy and shadow. Focusing purely on smite would be less dps than the normal rotation, but not by a ton. You'd still be wanding a lot to be an efficient grinder.
---
With maximum efficiency a levelling rotation would probably look like holy fire + swp + smite + smite/wand.  You'd likely still cast sw:p unless you were role playing a holy priest ;) 
---
Here's a decent pre-44 build that emphasizes smite: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bA0MoZbxth0bZx
---
At 44 you can switch to pure shadow or keep fleshing out your smite build.
---
Here's a possible disc/holy hybrid build for lvl 60 that includes the important Smite talents (force of will, holy reach, searing light): https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGshiVobxtMbb
---
The only real way to tell if its viable is to try it out and see if you like it:)
---
I kept buying weapons from vendors for whatever reason and I had no money at all when I needed to buy a mount. Until one day my brother was like dude, what are you doing? I also didn't understand that their is a certain optimal talent tree to put a certain amount into. Also played a warrior which was horrific.
---
[removed]
---
I planned it this way.
---
The reason I considered it was Joana - also he did do it on a f.r.e.s.h cause he was the first to 50. But there wouldn’t have been as many as today..
---
I also am in a position to be able to play 120 hours in a week and a half - but even if I could why would I want to.
---
I’ll do 1-40 and burn out hard and be back the next month honestly.
---
If they have sharding beyond level 1-5 zones (starting zones) after few weeks, people will be pissed me included. Its everything that vanilla wasnt and I have hard time having fun in a world that isnt alive.
---
This is truly the deepest level of irony
---
Haha no botting here, all leveled by me. I honestly loved vanilla leveling (still do, have a bunch of 60s on pservers and I'm still not sick of it!). I agree that the average guild won't be clearing raids in 60 days due to the speed of leveling, but I think any guild that can reliably get 40 people (in any kind of gear) with a decently geared main tank will probably be able to clear MC/Ony without too much trouble.
---
AQ and Naxx will probably be a bitch though for most of the reasons you stated, getting a full raid geared (and dealing with turnover and attrition and guild poaching and all that jazz) can be a nightmare.
---
Idk man, how would the world look if dinosaurs weren't wiped out of existance?
---
I personally just want everything unchanged, warts and all minus reckbomb kind of stuff.
---
Probably not near the top of the damage meters would be my guess. You'd obviously be gaining a lot of holy damage, but you'd lose other offensive stats like spell hit and spell crit.
---
Sanc aura + Seal of Crusader, too. Huge buff to holy damage.
---
Protection paladins are god-tier though. They hold aggro so well that they don't even need a taunt. /s
---
I had a couple rarer blacksmithing recipes, and after getting hassled/lowballed too many times... I just used my gold to craft the items and put them on the AH and posted them in trade chat. For some reason people were happier paying more for a complete item than paying for a small crafting fee for a rare recipe... 
---
The amount of random people who think you should craft them a lionheart helm for free is hilariously tragic.
---
"4 Strength 4 Stam Leather Belt"
---
Priest talents would give +10% crit, +15% spell damage, and 20% damage reduction (not to mention fade).
---
You'd have to get creative with hit pieces.
---
A fair concern, but if server pops drop blizzard will likely merge them.
---
That's too easy, people can claim they didn't see it. Coming from IT, you must expect the populous to be braindead. 
---
Sorry I did a poor job of explaining the grips. I don't mean that anything should be removed. 
---
Essentially your playing Combat Rogue you press a button, sort of like a warrior stance, that makes it so you hold your offhand backwards. 
---
     
---
Now it hits faster but there is some downside. Perhaps your parry is lowered by X% or your chance to hit with the offhand.   
---
Just small toggle skill like that with the effect changing depending on weapon. The availability of the toggle is determined by class or possibly by future talents instead of bastardizing the talent system. 
---
The same since they were not wiped out of existance, the avian lineage of dinosaurs are still thriving.
---
I was doing Ulda on my warrior and we were dying and someone explained threat. That made it alot easier. Before that I thought it was just random who the mob attacked. This was back when our guild leaders weren't even 60 but we idolised their gear. I bet them to 60 through no lifing.
---
That my first mount would cost 99 gold and not 99 copper (I gathered up copper and went to the Brill stables at like level 7 lmao)
---
I was 14 in Classic. My best friends were a mage and warrior. Mage friend would conjure food and trade us. At the end of the night we would log off. Next few days the warrior friend would get really mad at us. Never explained why until he snapped. He accused us of logging into his account and stealing his mage food...
---
Agreed. I just love the content in WotLK. I'd scaled back my WoW time by that point though so didn't get to raid much, a lot I'd like to experience, ideally with the best features of vanilla preserved. 
---
Why am I being downvoted for correcting someone's factually wrong opinion?
---
Think before you press the button, thanks.
---
as a horde player, i didnt even consider paladins. damn that'd be scary.
---
Well, you can read into that as much as you want, but there is no talks of TBC from Blizz right now. And in the video they say 2 years after release, where do they get that number? They are pulling it out of their ass just like I am.
---
afaik SoC has an internal CD like Windfury so it can’t proc off itself/multiple times off a reckbomb. 
---
The only way they could monitor top good progression in new raids was to have a GM avatar present in the raid that they could view from and run around etc. They did this at least up until cata as I personally witnessed this in icc.
---
&gt; TL DR nig
---
Naturally Insightful Greatpost?
---
Not familiar with the acronyms these days.
---
True preservation, as you put it... Would mean readjusting bosses to be more difficult considering the 1.12 talents and other things. Put some effort in like the guy your replying to. Your preferences are stupid.
---
Correction, you were a BADASS hunter ;)
---
Excellent music choice
---
Not me, but my friend got tricked into thinking that if he went to Blackrock Mountain and looked in the lava he would see Ragnaros taking a hot , steamy, lava shower. My friend proceeded to go towards Burning Gorge at a very low level(10ish) and got killed so many times along the way, only to have the whole Internet cafe where we played wow laugh their asses off as he was confused why he couldn't see Ragnaros taking a shower. Those were the good old days :') 
---

What is that addon you have? I almost never used addons but I remember that one.

Cmon, we’re starved for content, but we’re not this desperate. 
---
ranking as you level is a damn good argument. 
---
and yeah, if someone earns rank 14 gear, they fuckin *earned* it. 
---
lol this is pretty cool that you have this 
---
Low effort, high yield.
---
Good investment fella! 
---
Even if players didn’t know about it. It seems Blizzard intended it because there are mobs populated on the lava route, and a staircase to let you up to the dark iron forge.
---
This video refers to a smite build at one point, looks like it is viable: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_CLytIpJniY&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CLytIpJniY&amp;t=)

YEAH CUS 10 YEAR OLD CONTENT IS SO EXCITING!!!! AMIRITE??!!
---
plz no bully
---
I didn't realize about jubeithos being a fresh realm in January 2006. But yeah I guess you are right.  That's pretty amazing.
---
Will be interesting to see how populations on classic wow servers at launch compare to 2006.
---
You're worse than he is. You should both hug it out, on your way off a cliff.
---
As an aged 14 Hunter in 2005, I levelled 1-40 by casting Aimed Shot, Concussive Shot and then spamming Arcane Shot until the mob got close to me. Then I would Raptor Strike and Melee then to death. Pet wouldn’t attack until they got to Melee Range (Defensive) and I didn’t have growl turned on....
---
A friend even bought me Nightblade as I said it was the weapon I wanted the most to do more damage. 
---
I am... retail so freaking sucked at the end of WotLK and didn’t stop... 
---
Sadly the community seems not to have focus on this. We were fed the "you need sharding in starting zones" lie and the community at large seems to have bought into it.
---
No launch of any Vanilla server ever had sharding in starting zones. Yes, it gets crowded, yes, it's hard to do quests and tag mobs.
---
That *difficulty* and *novelty* is part of the experience of the *first few weeks of a new server.*
---
It is literally integral to the experience and challenge of a new server. And yet we're getting sharding.
---
The "tourists" that they're so worried about scaring away won't be so bent out of shape for not being the first to level 60. They can start a day later, or a week later.
---
The "hardcore" players or genuine fans won't be turned off by the *limited* inconvenience of the launch week rush. In fact **most of what gives Vanilla significance is the inconveniences.**
---
And yet here we are, diluting the experience to appease "tourists" and retail minded players with something they don't need and negatively impacting the hardcore fans with something they don't want.
---
And all indications point to the fact that the "community" has bought into this hook line and sinker.
---
&gt;Imagine this sub is a BBQ restaurant.
---
But it’s not. So anything you say after this point makes no sense by default. 
---
I mean. Even if it was your analogy doesn’t hold up. But again, it’s not. He wasn’t asking for that. Your comment adds nothing to the discussion. 
---
I’m telling blizzard you’re using their intellectual property. I’m a snitch. 
---
There will be people that clear it very quickly because they will roll together 40 at a time fresh from pservers.  If it's weren't for those groups your be right.  The main thing people forget about vanilla is pop pop pop.   
---
Building a raiding guild is not just about getting the people because on a 1500 pop server, sometimes the people JUST DON'T EXIST.  Guilds didn't just have to find people, they had to find people who would actually show up, then train them to be raiders.  Then hope they stick it out for 2-3 months straight without rl issues or getting distracted by the pvp grind or a new fresh server, long enough to get geared and help guildies get geared.  There are not an infinite amount of dedicated raiders there to be picked up or poached like there are on a server with 8k people who are STILL playing classic after 15 years- the very definition of dedication.   Even top progressing guilds had very frequent openings because under classic, real world circumstances, the very best most dedicated raiders were not numerous enough to fill the best guild on a server for the duration of raid progression. So yes, I'm quite certain that on some servers, pserver vets will band up and dominate progression, but realistically, on servers that fill up organically, progression will be much much slower than pservers would indicate and it honestly has nothing to do with encounter difficulty changes.
---
plz no entitlement
---
Interesting concept for a tanking rogue imo! I had lots of ideas for new sub classes in retail!
---
*shadowbolt *SS *chain heal *flash of light, etc 
---
I am guessing they don't want to change gear itemization. Making them hesitant to add PvP rewards early. I hope they add it before raid powercreep makes it obsolete.
---
what are you even talking about my duder, how am i being entitled by acknowledging that something is necessary
---
At early levels (up to 30) mana regeneration doesn’t seem to be a problem. Does it get worse 40+?
---
I managed to level to 60, raid AQ40, being 12/13 years old and all I understood of English was 'Hi, Bye, Yes, No, Thank you'.
---
You could probably find a guide 2 clicks away that describes in detail how to down a boss in Molten Core by now. Did we have that available back in the day? No.
---
We had to do corpse runs, find out what the bosses did (if they did anything at all that is..). And don't forget, we didn't know anything. 
---
Our "best" healer had 182 bonus healing on his equipment. 182! With some decent gear today, I could bring a druid with almost 500 bonus healing into MC. Will it take time to get this? Yes. Several weeks? Maybe if you're unlucky or it's a really rare drop. 
---
BiS lists are out there, you just need to run the dungeons and keep at it. With a full premade group, you can even run the dungeon only for that boss.
---
Also with proper consumables, it will be easier. 
---
WotLK was an expansion I enjoyed very much at the time, but it was, without a doubt, the thing that introduced the cause of WoW’s downfall. 
---
Granted, I guess some things in TBC did that as well, but in Wrath it was more pronounced. Cata was just the nail in the coffin. 
---
No skeletons and you aren't sapped in Gadgetzan, you hosting some kind of local server for videos there bruv?
---
More around that you conceding as if they needed your permission.
---
I think that is his point 
---
Your just another dumbfuck youtuber that thinks they know how real Vanilla WoW was. Go back into your hole
---
I'm not a youtuber though lul
---
What about closer third person? I personally zoom pretty close compared to most people who like to have a football fields distance from the character.
---
Wrong word choice I guess. I know it was a hotly debated subject, and I'm just saying I think it will be necessary at launch.
---
Cause if you roll a balance then you get picked for like 28% APR and if you're paycheck to paycheck like most people you end up buried in debt.
---
If you're responsible, then it's free money.
---
In the whole scheme of things, Classic will likely 'end' at True 1.12. Unless they continue to add new content and changes past original 1.12, on which case I'd be gone.
---
In any event. Assuming the goal is to progress to 1.12, the only benefit of emulating genuine changes before reaching true 1.12 would be relatively short in the whole scheme of things. I would MUCH rather keep 1.12 values, regardless or the progression stage, than alter Classic in any way that would be different than original values.
---
Make no mistake, of they can pull truly accurate values from the original Vanilla data and make it exactly as it was during they specific progression point in Vanilla, then I am ALL for it. Otherwise, I'd rather keep 1.12 values.
---
I get the want for true Vanilla progression and true Vanilla values but, at the end of the day, an accurate 1.12 'emulation' is the endgame and endgoal. If they can make it truly accurate up up until the, that's great. If they can't, and they have to guess, then I'd rather keep 1.12 values and it'll all stabilize when we hit true 1.12.
---
TLDR: I'd rather have inaccurate progression releases than have them guess at what values should be and stick with indisputably known values as it was at whatever patch they have the full data from. 
---
I totally agree with you. Imagine waiting around for mobs--you'll be forced to interact with other players waiting and probably make a few friends on the way. All of the "inconveniences" in Vanilla force you to run into other players and create connections. Modern WoW is filled with skipping this aspect of the game.
---
I'm also sick of the private server elitists thinking they know exactly how the game is going to work. The same thing happened when OSRS was being released. It turned out that they were totally wrong. The elitists are stuck in their bubble. These same people ruined modern WoW and I am glad that the Classic devs are at least attempting to abide by the no changes policy.
---
If this is executed right, we could see a thriving community. The OSRS community is incredible and I hope the devs seek to repeat their success by sticking to a hard template.
---
^^ this guy 
---
&gt; I literally posted the video in my first response to you and then referred to it in each of my comments. How could it have been the priest guy?
---
Because you were vague. You could have said "the warrior" instead of "the guy". And you said he was doing "everything wrong" instead of making some mistakes that left DPS on the table. I don't think KT falls down if someone is doing *everything* wrong.
---
&gt; Not so much a personal attack as drawing conclusions from what you say. You for some reason shut down any time people criticize retail Vanilla raiders, yet are unable to respond to the actual substance of the criticism.
---
I guess to you "asking you if you have any direct experience of vanilla raiding or vanilla elite culture at all" is "shutting down"? Because you seem to have dodged that question.
---
I'm not saying every vanilla raider was perfect or anything like it. But if you weren't around for the EJ forums and weren't engaged with the serious players in the vanilla era you could easily fall victim to the uninformed pirate server circlejerk that none of the millions upon millions of retail vanilla players was anything other than a drooling moron, while near 100% of the few thousand pirate server raiders are God's gift to the 40 actions-per-minute world of elite gaming.
---
&gt; Dude, those points are literally just describing what's happening in the 1.5 hour retail speedrun footage and contrasting it with what's happening in the footage of a private server speedrun. It's not embellished, all the points are completely factual.
---
It's obviously a bad faith move to compare a "speed run" *which wipes* with one that doesn't. That's not apples to apples. Do you think that never ever in the history of retail vanilla a Naxx guild cleared MC without wiping?
---
Agreed, I care much more about the experience than the details, I don't want MC to be insanely hard where you have to have exact preraid BIS and full consumes to clear it, but I would also prefer it if the whole raid needed to at least have mostly dungeon gear and to halfway pay attention during it.
---
Lol! The shots with the night elf rogue was my cousin if i remember correctly, probably on a PVE server. Shadowmoon was PvP. I think the dwarf Priest and gnome shots were taken on the PTR for Zul'Gurub. I was was one of those idiots that cared about what the armor looked like and being a general goof ball in chat. I had a Dwarf Hunter named Mathra, a druid that i dont rememember the name of, and i'm sure what else.
---
Damn, you just checkmated his entire clade.
---
I mistakenly spent 5 silver on a stable spot as a druid, so I deleted my char because I didn't want to be behind in money and not be able to afford spells. I still have no idea why you were able to buy stable slots as a druid...
---
Spoiler alert. Everyone dies
---
Did you make this ?
---
&gt; I don't even know what point you're trying to make.
---
My point is, I just want that classic "feel". Blizzard should just code the way I feel.
---
[original source](https://www.reddit.com/user/Which_Locksmith/comments/b0ugnv/tazdingo/)

I did this on a Pserver a while back (only got to about lvl 40 before life took over).  It can be done, and it can be fun to walk around in gear you made, and enchanted yourself.  However, as others have said, you WILL be broke at all times and it will slow you down a little.  As a warlock you can afford this from the free mount at lvl 40.  
---
The one piece of advice I can give you is on quests.  Only do quests that:  
---
1) Give you an upgrade, or some other great reward.  
---
2) Are against humanoid mobs.  
---
3) You just want to (at the end of the day, it's a game, have fun).  
---
Any quest that doesn't tick one of those 3 boxes, skip and spend the time grinding on humanoids for cloth drops.
---
That would make sense to why I only remember one fp.
---
The majority of this sub reddit are uninformed private server babies.
---
Holy Priest is my favourite by a mile. Keep your wand up to date while leveling and you’re golden. You’ll never wait to get in a dungeon group either.
---
Patchnotes 1.12.0: 'Vanish now removes effects that allow the caster to always remain aware of their target (currently Hunter's Mark and Mind Vision).'
---
I guess his vanish was on CD.
---
But I was more talking about a rogue sitting in brm unstealthed lol.
---
Adopt the OSRS model. No level cap increase. No new classes (or skills). Instead, expand upon the current content and if content is added, do not let it gimp older content. Blizzard made the mistake of releasing expansions that effectively gimped the old content. The power creep needs to be controlled and the game will continue to thrive.
---
Do you know what reading comprehension is? Apparently not.
---
I'm in pretty much the same exact boat. I don't get off until 10PM PST and have been unable to find a west coast late night raiding guild so far...let me know if you find one
---
My good friend that got me to play was a blacksmith and I rolled a Tauren warrior. Once I reached level 10 he made me the best items for my level, most of which were green with stats. Upon reaching level 13 I was able to buy this awesome looking armor from a vendor in Orgrimmar, all of which was gray with no stats.
---
 It wasn't too long after that my I met up with my buddy in the game and once he saw that not only was I not wearing the armor he made me but wearing worse armor he got so angry with me. To my defense the armor he made me looked super ugly.
---
How about look at OSRS and see what they did? No TBC, instead we have a content expansion that doesn't gimp old content at all while maintaining the "classic" feel. It has worked out well for them.
---
Plus you'd have 10% from a ret pally. Since if holy was a smite / holy fire build, you'd want that extra.

I liked the unfinished area at the top of the deadmines. If you wall climbed the giant cliff behind the boat in the final room you could go up to a giant piece of land and run around, eventually finding floating rocks / trees and some kind of arcane magic
---
It's not a strawman, it's a 1:1 comparison.
---
Community for convenience vs community for convenience. Both are shit.
---
Honestly legion was definitely one of the best expansions. 
---
I totally agree!
---
get that red hot chili peppers playlist ready
---
Are you serious? 
---
The absolute best PvP games are the ones you queue for a BG at level X9, ding before the queue pops, and head into the BG at level X0.
---
The biggest one is probably queuing at 39, singing 40, learning skills, buying your mount, and getting into a 30-39 BG as a level 40 with a huge talent/skill/mount advantage. 
---
It can only be done every 10 levels, but it’s super fun. Not exactly what you were asking but thought I’d throw it in here anyway. 
---
The mounts should be available for the first 5 months of Classic, just like in vanilla. Don't tie it to a phase.  
---
You have 5 months to get it or tough shit.  
---
Also mounts before the system changed were 1000g for the mount and negligible cost for the skill. You could reduce the mount cost to 800g with PVP rank 3 (10%) and Honored with the faction you're purchasing from (10%)  
---
I mean based on your own post you pretty much answered your own question. You gave cons to all but the warlock and liked the appearance. Seems like an obvious choice to me. 
---
As a (former) rogue twink, I loved the 29 bracket. You got access to poisons (instant/crippling/mind numbing), vanish, cheap shot, and I think Rupture too. It felt like a huge power jump from 19.
---
Speaking of the 19 bracket, no offense to those that liked it, but I fucking hated it. My 19 twink battlegroup felt like it was 70% hunters, 20% rogues, 9% priests, and 1% other. There was no variety, it was so boring. You saw a lot more variety at 29, and you also got to do AB!
---
Feed that poor wolf, please
---
It was only abusable on private servers because sitting would force a crit on you, but on retail, it needed to be a "natural" crit (even though sitting caused a guaranteed crit, it wasn't enough)
---
I’d say WotLK was still more good than bad though. Get rid of the LFG random tool for 70-80 content, make the gear less powerful from patch to patch, and then introduce Mythic dungeons to get your x2 of the good badges while regular heroics give the obsolete justices. 
---
Then, it would be virtually perfect, in my eyes.
---
Male troll mage, its a bold move lets see if it plays out.
---
Besides the original 3, Legion is the best out of all of those easily. MOP probably had better class design though. 
---

---
To be fair we had addons back then too.  
---
If it follows broken pserver strats... You could bring 4 ret paladins for 0/1/2/3 stacked improved seal of the crusader for +140 / +147 / +154 / +162 (plus 603 holy damage) on every spell.
---
Rank 8 smite would do 400 damage + 400(?) healing (holy damage) + 603 from paladin, add 10% from sanc aura... 1543 per non crit smite. @ 2.5s that's 617 base DPS before any buffs, crits, curses, etc.
---
Holy fire would do like 1200 + 400 per tick.
---
Raids would be 1 Tank, 8 paladins, and 31 priests.
---
&gt;What is the Best class with the absolute top tier end game loot?
---
In full BIS, without-a-doubt, warriors. 
---
Also, even if you stacked as much stamina as possible from all BIS gear, nobody (including warlocks) could get anywhere close to 30k health. I don't think it was even doable in BC unless you had an insane amount of world buffs or something. 
---
30k health sounds unreachable IIRC
---
Wish I still had my boxes, but I think my family scavenged them. Or rather, it was always my family’s boxes but I scavenged the computer from them from time to time to play them. 
---
Maybe I can go hunt down the dungeon guide...
---
I'd agree with the sentiment but I wouldn't call it WoW's "downfall".
---
People tend to forget that the first tier of WotLK was an entirely reused raid instance.
---
People tend to forget that Trial of the Crusader was painfully dull and boring, and excruciatingly easy save for 1-2 fights (I will say, Anub on Heroic was quite the challenge...).
---
People tend to forget that ICC was panned for being nerfed too soon, and for being extremely long.
---
The one boss instances were called lazy, and lame excuses for content.
---
WotLK had some high points, but it also had some low points. If blizzard had released WotLK today it would very likely be panned.
---
"Wrath Baby" was considered an insult at this time. People said gear was being handed out, the game had become too easy, etc etc... 
---
Don't get me wrong, I had A LOT of fun during WotLK, but I had a lot of fun with the subsequent expansions too.
---
Considering about 11k was considered Kara ready in BC, I doubt a vanilla warrior would get near even that. 
---
I played all (except from WoD what I, from a lore perspective, find annoying) and even Legion was boring (to me). Everything after WotLK ... I don’t understand why people played WoW further. 
---
It's so funny seeing people on this sub talk about how amazing and pure Wrath was when there was so much rage and unhappiness about welfare epics and discussion about how the xpac had ruined the game at the time
---
a raid you are bound to heal/bless/cleanse if you want to always get a spot, if you want to tank/dd you are a hybrid so play like one. Don't ever do only one thing, get to do everything so people will call you when a spot is open in any position
---
I used the Cruel Barb (Deadmines level 20ish sword) for WAY too long because I thought stats were everything and I didn’t see a better upgrade stats-wise. I don’t remember what level I was, but suffice it to say I was high enough to be in Hilsbrad Foothills... oh, and I didn’t just recently reach the zone either, I had already completed all the quests for the area... yeah...
---
Yeah that's my problem in rating them. The class design and loot systems have gotten steadily worse but the art and (the best of) the quests have really been incredible. Note that I don't mean the lore. The lore is an abortion from what WC3 birthed. 
---
level 5-6: go learn proffesions
---
level 10: Go make your voidwalker quest
---
level 10: Talents, there is a wide variety of speccs you can try, but most will tell you do play affliction.
---
level 30: there is a quest in barrens for a good robe, quite a long quest but def with it.
---
level 38-44: Shadoweave Set ( tailor crafted )
---
level 40: Free mount speak with warlock trainer in IF.
---
level 50-60: Start working on Felcloth gear, and Robe of the Winter NIght.
---
Other than that its not so much to it. you dont need much to level as warlock. Try to only spend gold on learning the abiitys you will use.
---
There is a decent guide. if it helps you: https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;t=14455
---
As a player who loves farming gold but doesn't want to commit to scheduled raiding I might find myself on the other end of things this time around.
---
This was my first MMO I remember reading the box and manual in the car ride home from the local games shop, getting so excited about creating my own character playing however I wanted.
---
I was trying to think about ways I could stand out from the crowd as I assumed there would be like 60 characters at least online, so I decided I was going to play a rogue but with a twist.
---
What was my plan you may ask? Well it was simple why would I want to use daggers or even Duel wield, I wanted to use one sword and a shield.
---
So I set off on my Night elf Rogue, as soon as I found my first sword I sold my dagger and I stayed this way to 60 only ever wielding that one 1 sword (it was a nightmare), I assumed equipping a shield was at a rare trainer that I hadn't found yet.
---
Finally my guild convinced me how stupid I was, I was so upset I re-rolled a warlock.
---
This makes me sad. I understand, but still.
---
See trolls, see, see what ya did? @#$$ you. 
---
Honestly who got bothered by your maps? I don’t understand why you need to publicly apologize. 
---
I meeeeeeeeeeean vs a resto? Can't really argue there's much skill in killing a resto as a pally.
---
My first character was a bald human with that dopey old man face and a goofy black goatee because I didn't know you could customize your character. I mashed right click to autoattack faster for weeks and used a lot of agility gear on my paladin for that sweet dodge/armor. I put talent points in random trees so my character would be more "balanced," and thought I could learn all the talents at max level anyway.
---
It took me until about lvl 20 before I realized you could actually repair your gear. Before this ground breaking feature appeared to me, I had just sold the gear when it went to zero durability, and then reequipped new gear. I remember having to buy common quality gear from vendors to even have anything equipped. My economy did not get off to a good start...
---
Also, I had a similar experience as OP. First character paladin dwarf. I didn't notice there were different tabs in the talent tree, so I just put everything in the first one (holy). I think it took me until level 40 before I discovered the Ret tab. Fuck me, leveling was slow before that. I did end up maining holy pally all the way through wotlk though, so gg I guess.
---
I can't visualize how that would work, but it sounds cool. By eliminating the columns it would make it appear to sink into the bezel? Cool thought.
---
Assholes will be assholes. Try not to let it get to you. As easy as it is to just pass on posts you may not be interested in it seems sum need to piss on others enjoyment and efforts.
---
Fuck them.
---
The fact it was a one shot sure, fact it was against a resto not really.
---
I had crap gear and someone whispered me in a dungeon telling me to get better gear before running another one.
---
I didn't know how to get better gear. He told me to "farm it". I asked in /trade "how do I farm gear?" (Lol huge mistake) several people start telling me a bunch of nonsense about seeds and sheering sheep and just "farming" stuff.
---
I spent 2 days running around Westfall attempting to "farm" materials to make better gear. Someone finally took pity on me and told me the truth.
---
I miss being that new.
---
take away their stun or their stealth and 99% of rogues become total crap and just run away.
---
True, WotLK is the g.o.a.t. 😍
---
Guess who works 2pm-10pm? This guy!
---
There will be a stable amount of us night owls, I'm sure. The trick well be to find a stable 5 man of them that won't have one person rocket ahead of the group. 
---
for me, WOTLK was the climax of wow. 
---
I recall our MTs had about 10k HP during MC/BWL progression with buffs.
---
As an 11 year-old hunter, I got into raiding and constantly being asked why my dps was so bad.  I couldn't figure it out - I had hawk on, I had upgraded ammo, I had decent gear, MM talents, everything.  So somebody watched me dps on a fight.  And they were like "hold on...why aren't you using Steady Shot ever?"  So I said, "Steady Shot is a cast so it will stop my autos from firing!" I thought steady shot worked like every other hunter spell (scare beast, revive pet, etc) because it had a cast bar.  I was in a raid environment and considered myself good at the game generally
---
People like you are ruining this subreddit.
---
I’m talking unbuffed my dude 
---
Unpopular opinion but i actually enjoyed cata, i just wish it was more difficult and that they didn't completely fuck up the map.
---
Now mop on the other hand................
---
People need to make an early sat or sun morning raiding guild.  You’re not strapped during dinner time with the family and you can wake up early to raid and have the rest of the day free.
---
You don't have to apologize for having harmless fun dude.
---
I didn’t see the comments on your posts but thoroughly enjoyed checking out the maps you had been posting, I really like the style regardless of what tools were used.
---
What were users getting so upset about? I don’t see anything wrong with them in my opinion, although that being said I only briefed over the rules on this subreddit.
---
Keep up the good work regardless! I can envision your maps being used in an AddOn as a replacement for the default maps which would actually be pretty epic! If you end up making a complete set of maps and needed help making an AddOn feel free to hit me up.
---
Lol this is some 2019 level apologetics.
---
By "trolling others" I guess you mean that they are not playing their class in a way that optimizes your play experience. How incredibly inconsiderate of them. You're not self-entitled at all.
---
Can you link me said BiS lists? I haven't found a solid website like shadowpanther for ret paladin or ele shaman.
---
Could you please send me a link for this discord? 
---
Vanilla was the most hardcore and down to the roots, TBC just felt like a mini expansion, and wotlk changed the game by fucking miles and had the perfect medium of causality and enjoyability, then once cata hit it started to get a little too casual and less fun, every xpac after that did the same and now the only point in modern wow is basically just playing mythics and competitive pvp. 
---
If they dont like it, they'll outnumber and downvote more than we upvote.

“Me and 39 other dudes meet up a cave once a week to kill the broodmother.”
---
time is money friend
---
I can’t decide between an orc shaman or UD priest. Would be healing in 5 mans and raids and preferably rolling ele/resto or shadow for pvp...once I have an offset of dps gear. I’m not opposed to healing in BGs while I gear.      
---
What are some of the pros and cons for raiding, bgs, and gearing for each class?
---
IDC if ranking is in from the start but it'll just make the leveling 48-60 for anyone rolling on the smaller faction on pvp servers a nightmare because they'll be grinded for honor.
---
&gt; Patch 1.8.0 (2005-10-10): • The percentage of players that may reach ranks 6 through 14 has been increased.
---
No reason not to have this at launch. It makes the brackets bigger and makes the ranking slightly healthier without making it easier for randoms to gain high ranks.
---
No point in talking much about the last two points. The first one has been beaten to death and back. The second one we can't know until Blizzard gives us more info. Oh and also 
---
&gt; especially 14 gear… does it really matter? 
---
I'd say rankers getting AQ-level weapons before BWL is even out is kind of an issue. Especially if there's no progressive itemization, since those weapons were only buffed to AQ-level on the BWL patch.
---
I kept deleting characters
---
Wrath was when I quit wow the first time (didn’t come back until wod) and I was at a low point in my life.  If ever a time existed when I needed the escape of wow, it was during wrath, and it brought me nothing but frustration and a foreboding feeling of “Am I wasting my time?”
---
Gear obsolescence between patches ruins an MMO, and wotlk was the first time it became really prominent.
---
I was recruited to the game by coworkers, who had a guild.  After about a week, I said in guild chat: "Does anyone else jam scissors into their W key so they can smoke week?" 
---
When I was 12, I spent at least a week grinding spiders in duskwood because I assumed combat training was the same as RuneScape. Really didn’t help that I was using int gear on a fury warrior...
---
Seals didn't stack in the demo, we'll see if they stack in the Beta though...
---
Oh wow you certainly defined your class name! What a hunt!
---
Maybe because it was not updated in AQ. Its a "correction" private servers do to make the item-level on the pvp gear to be on pair with content. It was actually updated in 1.11
---
I was wondering if wall walking would make a return, but I assumed it would not.
---
Old Ironforge. Dancing Troll Village, which is think was called Shatterspear Village Airport/Landing Strip on top of Ironforge. The cabin tucked away behind Elwynn above the waterfall. Top of Orgrimmar. Hyjal was a classic. Wetlands Farm.
---
I don't remember how I did it exactly, but I managed to get the blimp from Orgrimmar to take me to GM island. That actually took downloading a file from somewhere.
---
I also remember a connecting with a guy that got campfires to turn into Dark Portals, so you could climb crazy distances. Looking back, I have no idea how we did this on a public server without getting perma-banned. I hearthed out of GM Island super quick out of fear.
---
Then how about just normal secret areas? Cut Throat Alley in Stormwind. Anyone remember Alcaz Island and all the Hydras and finding Varian Wrynn down in the holds? I managed to kill the Sewer Beast a couple times in Stormwind, which was always cool. 
---
There was always the fabled Emerald Dream. An unfinished zone you could really only get to on a private server. I quit playing at BC and only dabbled in the other expansions, so I'm unsure if it ever actually became a part of the game. I feel like the portal I'm Duskwood where the dragon world boss spawned had some connection if I remember correctly. 
---
Uhhh, Mind Quickening Gem + Berserking?! Come on now.
---
With the talents you can outrange many fear mechanics anyway.
---
Troll mage is actually the most common PvE min/maxing Horde mage race.
---
So close to the safety of the instance portal...
---
... and so far away from the graveyard.
---
Nah, I'm good.
---
See how exciting this is? PvP servers are like this all the time! Always flagged! Simply an amazing experience.
---
Except when you don't want it and you're getting gank banged... but that's a fair price to pay for glory.
---
30K is Wrath of the Lich King territory
---
My thoughts, too. I was thinking 15k was around max for tanks 
---
Hehe glad I could help. 
---
And we had idiots. And no shortage of those in sight even now! Should be interesting.
---
I actually did a run one time and I thought the guys were fucking with me while we were doing it. Only did it once or twice though.
---
i think some of it is really just down to experience and your current circumstances. eg; maybe you see a group quest that gives an upgrade in gear and go oh that'll be easy, but a group just isn't happening, or you get one together and spend a shit ton of time dying for what was a minimal upgrade vs just grinding the whole time. and then you know not to do The Den again.......
---
in any case, your math seems solid! i'm not too knowledgeable on the math-related stuff here, but i wish you luck on your grinding journeys
---
I leveled to 38 as a Melee Hunter cause I hated dealing with my pet, it always ran away..
---
I used to think once armour was red you had to sell it
---
I was also 13 when I played. 
---
Ironfoe was desirable in Vanilla too. Maybe the pserver version is stronger, maybe it's weaker. We really don't know. All we know is that it was desirable during Vanilla, and that the Blizzard devs have the 1.12 data so it should be all good.
---
Aww man...
---
I don't expect them to, but Max rank in some pservers stacked different of the same rank with improved talents. This is all a hypothetical since + healing is not + holy damage.
---
War of the ancients trilogy.
---
Emphasis on MALE troll mage.
---
to overpower and dominate the broodmother.  Hmm
---
This is getting good.
---
Yeah of course, that's why I specified (in large caps for emphasis!) that you should only put things on the card if you can afford to.
---
30K was probably early LK, but it got a lot higher by ICC
---
Now that you say that, I remember our druids being pretty bad as well. Orean was the best druid in our raid (way better than me) and I was better than the other druids, of which there were few. 
---
The funny thing was that people would bring in alt druids to soak up easy loot in MC and BWL, but even though the loot was free, people still didnt want to raid with their druids and would just go back to their mains to stack up DKP for the next item they wanted. Being a Druid definitely isnt for everyone but I adore it. Can't wait to raid and pick up all that sweet, sweet healing gear.
---
Yeah, even though it was like 2 months of rank 1 or 2 wrath of nature spaming...we still had a blast. Although it DID take all four of us to gang up on most anything just to kill it in a timely manner. 
---
Wtf are these autistic etchings
---
This was me up until about level 20. I still remember training 1 hand swords on my rogue, buying whatever generic sword, probably a cutlass, and spending my money on mats to get it a +1 damage so it would glow. To me, having a weapon that glowed was important.
---
im in a similar boat as you.  I'll be looking to pug MC and later on BWL but mostly ZG / AQ20
---
I stand corrected. Bring on the thicc trolls.
---
Classic will be full of whiney children who quit after 5-6 months just before blizz patch in all the QOL changes from Retail.
---
Dam.. totally forgot about this one. Been at least a decade since I've seen it
---
The 20-man raids will be pugged
---
That's my plan.
---
If level 30-32 takes 4 hours of grinding, that means you have 4 entire hours of sitting there, watching chat to see if there's a group getting together for that level 31ish quest to jump in at a moments notice, nab that upgrade, then get back to work.
---
Knowledge is power.
---
PS: Fuck the Den.
---
You think that you didn’t play, but you did
---
He's a friend of mine
---
Wrath was the most lore-rich expansion, filled with amazing innovations in mechanics, questing (**Phasing** dude!), in-game cinematics (Wrathgate, dude!) and everything you could want.
---
The problem wasn't the encounters, the content, nothing. That's what's sad. The problem was PURELY DECISIONS.
---
You could run a WotLK private server that would be the perfect improvement on TBC by only making a couple of minimal changes, like removing badges, reducing Halls of Reflection, Trial of the Champion etc drops to be regular heroic level so that dungeons no longer made you skip entire tiers of content, disable the Dungeon Finder, and change the colour of heroic drops to blue.
---
The only change that'd be hard to do is to retune heroics to be more in line with TBC and add the attunements that made it rewarding to finally be able to step into a heroic dungeon. Other than that? My chief problems with WotLK have always had to do with the "solutions" Blizzard found for "problems", rather than anything in the core.
---
WotLK remains the expansion that pretty much ruined the game for me. But it was the **most** fun I've had leveling up, no encounter was more fun than the WotLK encounters, etc. Ulduar and ICC were jaw-dropping.
---
Just... the fucking LFD, catch-up mechanics, and dungeon heroics / epics trivialization ruined it for me. Something that would be surprisingly simple to either undo or simply NOT DO.
---
I don't remember when but my first add on was atlas loot. I didn't get bagnon until years later.

Whoa, dont you know you're talking to a WORLD 50+ BADASS. His word is LAW!
---
Don't see why you have to apologize. That's what moderators are for. The mods left it up, so let the jobbers bitch. Everyone won't like everything. It's fine. There's a voting system for a reason.
---
If I see one I will now blame you. 
---
Yeah. TBC introduced it with the Badges of Justice, but it was ludicrously slow. It was not an alternative to raiding, it was supposed to speed up people in the tiers below, and I think that's perfectly okay. Just a power boost. It didn't *supplant* content and no one was decked in Badge gear. In fact, I think the Badges of Justice only gave you trinkets, rings, and maybe hands or something? Like, I'm pretty sure there were no chests, helms, weapons etc from that Naaru.
---
There were definitely chests and helm etc from Sunstrider Isle vendor in 2.4, but that's end of expansion, I can get giving players even a bigger boost to catch up faster. But **that's** a catch up mechanic. 5 man heroics dropping gear that's BETTER THAN ULDUAR is ludicrous!
---
that's a good point i hadn't considered, just grinding and waiting to jump into a group instead of forming it yourself would be way more beneficial! i'll keep that in mind
---
Cata made me quit tbh, and I was disgusted with MoP until I actually resubbed (Throne of Thunder patch) and was absolutely blown away. Thematically I hated MOP, but I'm so glad I gave it a go because the Throne of Thunder was a very fun raid, as was Siege of Orgrimmar. Glad I didn't have to deal with the Mogu'shan and Sha stuff though, those places looked very boring thematically (in my opinion).
---
That's what it felt like they were going for.
---
I've tried reck bomb ret paladin. It's really gimmicky and will be worse in classic than on private servers due to sit crit not triggering reckoning. I'd rather play any caster over a ret paladin. It's probably the best melee besides rogues (which it counters) at 1v1ing. That isn't saying a lot though as the only other melee are enhance shamans, feral druids and warriors none of which feel very threatening 1v1. 
---
That's only on private servers. In real vanilla, silver, gold, and truesilver were actually rare like they were supposed to do.
---
They're quite similar. The most common difference between both is **two-handed weapon specialisation** and **dual wield specialisation**.
---
I say "most common" because there are variations to both specs.
---
I only did 19 rogue, warlock, and hunter/29 rogue/39 warrior and priest in vanilla, but I had a 49 warrior twink in BC with Kang’s. When they moved Death Wish to the Arms tree...I don’t think I’ve ever had more fun twinking. Especially with my guildie’s pocket paladin. My god. Such a great bracket. Mounts and 31 point spells make things so much more bearable.
---
I don't see how guilds would look at a "raid score" when you'll be in a guild before you start raiding in the first place. Pug raids also aren't going to be checking that score. You're inspected and invited if you're geared enough, not invited if your gear sucks.
---
Nobody's going to check your "raid score" for dungeons because 95% of the people running dungeons aren't raiders (outside of DM:T for buffs). In fact, I don't think I've ever seen someone get kicked/not invited to dungeons because of their gear. It was always because of their class.

It’s pretty safe to say that most pvp videos are misleading because scenes are generally cherry picked from a collection of sessions showcasing the best footage and leaving out the ugly. To be fair, some people are just really fucking good all of the time but generally pvp videos are just highlights. Leveling takes a long time and gearing takes a long time— play something that you like. With enough practice every class has a spec that can be great in some aspect of pvp.

I agree the naming is garbage. I also thought that need is selfless, greed is selfish.
---
I either sit there and wait... or post "killing Mor'Ladim in 30 minutes, be there or be square" Join others or prep early.
---
I would never consider any class expensive.  In the time it takes to level a farming class you would earn thousands of gold from doing whatever you choose on warrior.
---
If you can wade through all the shit, /r/wowservers has a lot of good guides about dungeon quests and other relevant things people have created over the years on private servers.
---
I welcome original content over the same rehashed topics over and over again. 
---
Look for videos strictly in WSG/AB and the other forms can be misleading and don't show group context very well. As a hunter you are mostly setting a trap under yourself, trying to cause trouble for 1-2 targets(cloth to leather range usually) by pressuring them with damage. They force commitments from long range, fight or just get harassed and chipped away.
---
Mages blow everything up regardless of reasons they wouldn't be able to.
---
I’d be curious how a theorycrafter could rank each spec by PVE or PVP DPS with the absolute BiS (including set bonuses). 
---
Warriors will be #1 on both charts and I’m guessing Balance is last, but I’d be curious where pure DPS classes rank 
---
I agree with you, and I think those conversations will emerge closer to release once we know a bit more about itemization and Blizz’s plans. 
---
Honestly I liked Cata at launch because the heroics were really damn hard compared to how easy most of them were in Wrath. Then everyone complained, Blizzard made it easier and that's the route they've been following ever since. 
---
I'm *really* reaching here -- but I recall this being due to folks looking for "easy" honor farms. 
---
Honor system was released in 1.4, but Battlegrounds were not released until 1.5. So players were incentivized to kill other players (finally), but didn't have objective based PvP yet.
---
Lots of city raids to kill AFKers and Badlands/Burning Steppes camps. City raids were also a good change to kill faction leaders, which gave lots of honor.
---
Problem with killing Bolvar... is that it bottlenecks the Ony attunement https://classicdb.ch/?quest=6403 and some other quests in Redridge/Burning Steppes- oh, and the Plaguelands (a fun Nathanos chain).
---
So in 1.4.1 they had Bolvar give no honor and respawn often.
---
Then in 1.7 they buffed all faction leaders hp/damage and made them worth a lot less honor. 
---
I don't even consider that a noobish thing to do.
---
It's completely stupid that they designed it so the mobs just disappear if someone tries to help. 
---
It's a social game and the vast majority of people won't be familiar with the quest. I was in the server-leading raid guild on my server, and I didn't learn about what those mobs were until I tried private servers last year.
---
I wasn’t that old and English isn’t my first language, spent hours looking for the mobs that had “Slain” in thier name “Slain Troggs 0/7” ect. This lasted a bit longer than I care to admit...
---
Archbishop is the only city boss I killed back in Vanilla.  
---
I want to correct my mistakes and kill every city leader in Classic. I'm Alliance now. So I cringe at the thought of how hard Sylvannas is going to be.  
---
Almost like I was answering your question, but whatever. Google it.
---
Classes like mage/rogue are bound to be a lot flashier: they're high-mobility/high-CC classes that can pull off flashy outplays with invulnerability frames and whatnot.
---
Classes like hunter/warlock are nowhere near as mobile and would play most matchups in a similar fashion. Popping out a big Aimed Shot/Soul Fire crit feels good every single time. Viper sting spam is pretty boring but having to peel for your FC/healers with scatter/wing clip/traps can be pretty neat to do. 
---
Hunters aren't going to do the big mechanical outplay like mages/rogues or have constant big numbers flying on their screen like warriors would. That isn't to say that they're bad though.
---
Just keep in mind that a class being more fun to watch doesn't mean it's more fun to play. Play what you yourself prefer.
---
Enhancement windfury crit 1shots are the most misleading ones
---
Yeah mounts are a big deal. Decreases downtime a lot since everyone is able to move around much quicker to get into the action. Also makes the movement speed advantage of certain classes, mainly hunter, druid, and shaman, not overpowered. Mortal strike is huge for warriors and being able to cleanse magic effects and avoid being cc'd with blessing of sacrifice is just as important for paladins. Together that makes the 49 bracket the one where the sacred duo of arms warrior and holy paladin first reaches its true potential.
---
at the Q&amp;A at blizzcon at one of the panels this was asked. blizzards response was that right now they don't have plans to allow these services but have not ruled out providing these services in the future.
---
would it be bad to name change? yes... server change? yes since it can be used to essentially clear your name.. no if a server ends up next to dead and they offer it to move high pop to low pop
---
To be fair, at least rogues have to keep up SnD, Evis at 5cp and not clip autos with their SS, right?
---
It was no doubt a slow day and he wanted to cheer a customer up. Wins points in my book.
---
As someone who quit RuneScape for WoW back in the day, I say go for it. Both games are enjoyable and you'll like it if you play with friends.
---
Good catch.
---
I know you were. It seemed like a pointless thing to point out since I thought you were the original guy who pointed out that Dave Ramsey disagrees with me, even though it seems from that answer that he actually agrees with me completely.
---
After noticing that you're a different person it all makes more sense.  I'll have to pay more attention to usernames!
---
Blackout was mean, I remember regularly seeing a horde premade from Al Akir popping up every 3rd BG and crushing us. 
---
The impression we have from blizzcon is:
---
&gt; There *may* be realm transfers - as they were in vanilla. They were mentioned in a "how to deal with dead servers" context. So maybe 'free transfers to low pop servers' or something? But that's all speculation. 
---
&gt; There will not be name changes, as they were not in vanilla. (added in Oct 2007 *(Burning Crusade)*)
---
So I remember my first Deadmines run at about 18 or 19. I pulled a mob off of the tank cause I attacked early(playing a hunter) and had a npc start attacking me. The tank told me to, “ stop pulling aggro!” To which I replied, “ I didn’t pull anyone named aggro dude! There isn’t even a mob named aggro.” That’s when I found out what aggro was. 
---
I'm not really expecting much of that at all.
---
Ret pallies are only decent versus melees. Casters and hunters destroy them because they can just kite/CC them and laugh as the paladin needs to waddle over to even try to hit them. They're also not threatening in BGs when melees realize they could be hitting anyone else and not have to worry about reckoning.
---
I've yet to lose to a ret pally because they have 0 way to counter hunters. For a hunter main, they're the biggest joke of all classes/specs in a 1v1.
---
I've actually being watching Warcraft 3 tourneys on Twitch. It makes me feel like replaying it but I'll just hold off for Reforged. 
---
Oh yeah, I liked that they upped the ante for it, but it was way too little too late. That was the **only** thing from WotLK they stepped back from, but it's probably the one I least cared about. Welfare epics, catch-up mechanics, LFD, it was all still there. In fact, I think cross-realm LFD was introduced with Cataclysm? Is my memory right?
---
I tried to frodo it through Burning Steppes as a human rogue until my friend told me there was a train.
---
Noted. Thanks!
---
You think that you are sorry for the maps, but you are not.
---
Kidding...could not resist the meme
---
If I do go warrior I will be prot so I don't see how I will be able to make thousands of gold. My proffs would be eng/mining (at 60. I plan to level lw/mining). It's going to be hard to farm anything(cant farm monsters efficiently as prot, and won't be able to contest mining nodes). If I have to respec everytime I want to farm, that is going to cut heavily into my profits. I plan to do almost non-stop dungeons/raiding for the next few months so I would pretty much have to end up respeccing multiple times a day.
---
If you have any tips on how to profit without farming I'm all ears though. I imagine I could try to up my "playing the AH" skills. 
---
Well I will probably listen to a few wow inspired songs just to get that feel of nostalgia. I used to listen to them a lot when leveling way back when. Such as Big Blue Dress. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w Of course I will listen to "normal" songs as well. Manowar, Eminem, Flatbush Zombies. The Lich King soundtrack etc. 
---
I hope not, given that it controls Mythic+ and raiding in retail :( Restricting certain elements of their API for Classic to avoid that info being pulled would be good. 
---
thanks for the comments, gents
---
This whole comment section in summary: 
---
"Differing opinions to mine?! REEEEEEE!!!"
---
I don't think so. Without cross server grouping, the pool of people you can draw from is much smaller. The cool thing in vanilla was you knew almost everyone either directly or though a friend. In 5 man pugs, the only real concern was their level, not gear or past performance. For raid pugs or guilds, talking about your current gear is already pretty normal. I don't see a site like that filling a need in classic. 
---
I'm unsure what metrics a site would use for evaluating classic players. Ilvl isn't a thing, neither are pug speed runs like m+. Dps and healing meters are not a reliable metric either since it's understood that is affected greatly by the group you're running with and strategies. And I don't even know how you'd evaluate a tank other than running with them. 
---
lmao..that's awesome...I just posted a video from 2006 and my intro song was from this series
---
Thanks I hate it
---
most of what raider. io is used for is mythic runs or heroic/mythic pugs for raids.
---
i am sure a site like that would show up.. if we have an armory at all.. it can maybe even show talents that they can't see in game.. may be used but I don't think it'll be as prevelant.
---
a lot of times in vanilla you might have a lower ilevel green that is better than a blue item (for things like ubrs) or a blue better than an epic, especially once DM is out. so would be difficult to really see.
---
on the same topic I'm sure if classic gets enough traction, you'll get to Sim your character and see what piece gives you better damage and what not. and probably even have wow analyzer look at combat logs if they are as extensive in the client to tell you what you did wrong on each encounter.. all sites out now for live that I could see being there for classic too. 
---
PvP videos are kind of like looking at someone's social media page; it's a highlight reel. They may give you a good idea of what the class is capable of, but not what to expect from it consistently. Personally, all of the melee (and I'll throw hunters in there too) aren't as enjoyable as the casters in vanilla. As a hunter in group play you're either defending or spamming viper sting on every caster and their mother. It's a very strong mana drain that's obnoxious and does more harm than any damage you could dish out. Mages are mainly used for battlefield control and for bursting priority targets. So polymorph and CS the healers, nova / CoC / Blizzard slow the melee and burst them down with a shattered frost bolt --&gt; fire blast/ CoC. 
---
The best thing to do, short of playing the class yourself, is looking at all of the abilities the classes have and determine if that toolkit sounds fun to you. That being said, it's really hard to do that without playing the class yourself. 
---
My personal advice is to play a mage. They can be the best class in the game if played correctly and scale amazingly well with gear. They have a high skill cap, but are easy to get the hang of. You counter every melee and can beat the other casters if you play well. They're top tier in PVE and one of the most in demand classes of Premade BG groups. You will be the #1 pick for dungeon groups for polymorph alone and also farm gold better than any other class. Hunters on the other hand are OP while leveling (including low level PvP), but don't scale with gear very well. I mained a hunter in 2005 and i would never do it again. After playing a mage on nost and leveling a warlock in late 2006  I would rather play any caster over a hunter (or any melee for that matter). 
---
This hits the spot.
---
TBC.
---
I took tailoring on my first warrior, also my first character, just so I could make bags I soon realised I made a mistake
---
Honestly, most melee are a free kill for hunters and casters. Rogues being the only ones that stand a chance versus non-mages.  
---
I think what you meant is
---
SIZABLE SUCC
---
I remember going to Best Buy for the midnight release of WotLK, and my little sister tagged along because she was curious why the fuck I would go to Best Buy at midnight. Then the leveling began and oh did I so love those WotLK zones. Grizzly Hills music gets me right in the feels.
---
And asmon 100% copied the idea of transmog competitions from Preach.. not much effort going on there tbh. 
---
J
---
No offense but is it a good idea to be a raid healing leader despite never having raid healed before? 
---
If I had a silver for every stupid thing I did to make myself "behind in money" ... none of them involved deleting a character. lol that is great. 
---
Guess what? If you are anything other than holy...you are the incompetent one.
---
still better than a 10 minute video of reading a blue post. 
---
On a recent server I played on I witnessed a full t3 warrior with all the buffs roughly around 10k~
---
The shot priority was spot on for hunters back then, avoid serpent stinging his vanish at all costs. The rogue wasn't willing to fight because you had more than 30% hp and weren't sitting down. This is classic vanilla.
---
The honor you gain while leveling is negligible. People will kill you anyway.
---
www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm
---
He's in the process of making/updating his leveling guide for alliance at the minute, keep it bookmarked and check back later, should be up before classic I imagine. His horde guide was top draw.
---
You don’t need to apologize anything. I’d honestly delete this and continue on like nothing happened. Close your eyes. Imagine a world where people get buttbothered because someone made a cool sprite map of a video game. Now imagine that same world, but those people are dumbasses. Now open your eyes. This is our world. They truly are dumbasses. 
---
Yep
---
For what it is worth I played an end-game raiding rogue, prot pally, and shadow priest.
---
And I didn't know that lol
---
I proudly wear the Wrath Baby badge, so while I don't necessarily disagree with any of your points let me address them from that perspective.
---
&gt; People tend to forget that the first tier of WotLK was an entirely reused raid instance.
---
This, I think is totally okay since almost nobody actually got a chance to clear Naxx when it was released. That's I think a fault of Vanilla instead of Wrath. Hoping that's something they fix with the reboot.
---
&gt; People tend to forget that Trial of the Crusader was painfully dull and boring, and excruciatingly easy save for 1-2 fights (I will say, Anub on Heroic was quite the challenge...).
---
Yeah. It's got some funny bits but the raid and really all the content around it was *such* a slog. Low point in the expansion for sure. Pretty sure I still haven't finished that rep grind. &gt;_&gt;
---
&gt; People tend to forget that ICC was panned for being nerfed too soon, and for being extremely long.
---
ICC was in fairness *really* hard at launch, and you could actually turn off the nerfs if you wanted to swing your balls around. That said it also was *really* well balanced. If you couldn't clear a boss it was because you either weren't geared for it (which was unlikely due to how easy it was to get badge gear or stuff from the 5-mans) or you were just flubbing the mechanics.
---
&gt; The one boss instances were called lazy, and lame excuses for content.
---
I honestly kinda liked these. Got ten minutes? Gang up with your friends and kill a boss. Might even get a mount!
---
I mean, I have to say 29, only because my 29 feral druid with feline swiftness was so incredibly broken in AB.
---
30% run speed in cat form in an outdoor BG when only Shaman and Hunters can get that fast as well, additionally, it was 30% run speed IN STEALTH as well. I practically dominated the battlefield on my own just from mobility.
---
At any rate, I really love the 29 and 39 brackets. Theyre a completely different game, no one has all their "signature abilities" yet and need to rely on complete different skill sets.
---
19 is similar, but very simple and dominated by Rogues and Hunters. 49 was a really fun bracket, because its like 60 PvP lite, you have all your signature abilities, just lower ranked with less gear and no 100% mounts. 59 PvP was pretty much the same as 60 except you didnt have people in epic gear running around.
---
This is ridiculous, allowing warlocks to stack dots at the cost of a global compared to a shadowbolt for 2.5 is night and day difference, they aren't comparable. When you fight a warlock in pvp and he drops 3 dots on you do you go "heh kid, that only increases your dps by 10%" 
---
Hold up, mages outperformed warriors in naxx by a decent amount, but is that more so because of fights in there being rough for melee (lower dps uptime)?
---
* Farming Templars/Dukes/Lords you summon from the Twilight's Hammer hubs using the cultist sets. 
---
* Farming tactical/logistic/combat badges for the good stuff that comes from turning in a bunch of them like Earthstrike, Might of Cenarius and Rockfury Bracers (+280 AP for 20s trinket, +4 wep/1% hit ring, +27 SP/1% spellhit cloth bracers).
---
Your posts got upvotes, i enjoyed them. Don't let the trolls get to ya bud. We love you here for sure
---
The original trilogy!!!
---
male trolls have cool as fuck casting animations, though.
---
but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if male or female, you're playing a troll, so you're automatically way cooler than about 97% percent of the playerbase. 
---
That's 1.12.
---
This video was released on Jun 2006. Patch 1.12 was released August 2006.
---
Don’t apologize when you did nothing wrong- especially if it’s to trolls. 
---
Craghack, did you play vanilla?
---
i played a druid back in vanilla  
---
i used cloth/caster gear but sometimes did use bear/car i died often in a 1v1 to mob same level  
---
things got better when i played mage in tbc  
---
both chars made it to 20-30 before i quit
---
BC was a good expansion, had fun, but flying mounts ruined everything. 
---
True. The dynamic spawns on pservers result in tons of surplus mats
---
I have no idea how people can go gold positive in this game while raiding. Unless your guild literally pays everything for you.
---
I bought that warlock stone that costed 1g. I was level 10 and I was given that gold by a higher level friend. I knew how hard it was to get 1g. And now I had a stone that I thought could summon demons.
---
It did nothing for a Night Elf Rogue. 
---
I mained a warrior. I used my talent points but I alternated them each level. 
---
So level 10, Arms got a point. Level 11, Fury. Level 12, Protection. Level 13, back to Arms. And so on. 
---
I also bought a fresh set of vendor gear every time I got to a new area. Then I complained about never being able to afford shit.
---
Silithus was devoid of content before then. I think there was a horde flight master on the border of ungoro but there were no other quests in that zone. This patch added the ch quest hub and some other NPCs in prep of aq release. 
---
I don't mind the hub being there but the ch rep rewards would be bad. Rockfury bracers for example are mage bis forever. 
---
I was #nochanges before I saw the possibilities in this video.
---
I can't really judge that one fairly since I didn't play vanilla so flying mounts were all I knew.
---
Really wish my first character had been a druid for the bear bomb though
---
Totally forgot about this. Awesome. 
---
I tried so hard to like Cata. But as a healer the expansion effectively demoted me from being the badass that saves the whole raid to being useless aside from undoing damage to the tank. It just felt so god damn awful I just burnt out.
---
This is why we are building a wall and deporting all illegal orcs from Stormwind.
---
Shut up.  People upvoted and the mods left it, it's all good.
---
Stop apologizing to morons on the internet.
---
I deleted my first ever character at like level 30 because I had too many quests and I didn't know what to do. I was a stupid little kid and now I'll never get that character back.
---
Love this comment.
---
Level 19 untwinked was pure PTSD.
---
Seeing that boar charge you, shortly after getting a concussive shot from an orc with green goggles on. 
---
I loved 39 on my rogue, the hemo spam was real. 
---
I personally think MOP was a great expansion, the last time I felt like the game was really worth playing. As much as I hated Kung fu pandas it was way better than cata imo 
---
&gt; You're going to out level a lesser magic wand before you even get the chance to make one.
---
This!  I remember thinking it would be cool to be able to craft my own clothes and enchant my own gear but the reality is that you're going to be poor and no matter how much time you spend or how hard you try to keep up your professions the stuff you can craft/enchant while leveling will be crap compared to quest rewards/drops/auction house.  
---
Please continue what you were doing so as to break up the massive circle jerk this sub has devolved into without the game being out. Much, much better content than BARELY relevant memes you'd find a 45 year old mother posting on Facebook. 
---
Jeeze dude now you've made this a whole thing lol. People just thought the whole front page being maps was stupid is all. You dont have to apologize.
---
I, personally, think it's something to be concerned about because I've experienced this first hand. I knew a player who was really good at getting others to dislike him intensely. He'd pretend to be other players, stir up drama, and was just really good at burning bridges and losing friends. He was full of unsolicited class advice that was often incorrect and bad. He'd make wild claims like "I'm \*insert vanilla wow "celebrity"\*" and could solo \*insert unsoloable mob here\* or acquired \*insert no longer obtainable item here\* oh but his corrupted ashbringer was lost in a server transfer. At least he wasn't a ninja looter or anything (as far as I know).
---
The problem is he would spread rumors about his friends. Then when things got too heated, he'd server transfer or faction change until he burned all his new bridges, which by then most of the past drama had blown over so he'd be back again.
---
Renaming isn't an issue, as far as I remember renamed characters aren't removed from your friend or ignore list, so people very quickly figure out who you are. Faction and realm transfers wipe you from ignore and friend lists, though, so you actually can drop off the grid.
---
I'm on the fence about rename, but faction and realm transfer are absolutely bad for the experience. If you screw up and find yourself blacklisted, suck it up like an adult and make amends and take the time to mend your reputation, or reroll. I don't think it should be a simple paywall to get off the community blacklist and get back to shenanigans as usual.
---
Looks like you're replying to the wrong comment bud. Has nothing to do with enjoying the game differently.
---
Timeline wise, rolling ignite was removed in TBC, pobably pre-patch but I'm not sure.  However, it's debateable whether rolling ignites will exist on official servers since it is a bug.
---
I hear you... But flying mounts killed world PvP, which was REALLY FUN, and a huge part of the game for a lot of people. With people flying all over, it killed player on player contact. Real bummer... The  PvP in bgs was it, and if u liked to raid , PvPing was really hard because of how different the gear started to get. The gap between PvP gear and PvE gear got too great. Almost impossible to farm PvP gear and raid at a high level, and have a job. 
---
I'm sorry this was your experience. I enjoyed your maps and I'm honestly baffled that anyone would get bent out of shape over it. Good luck with your future projects and thank you for the quality content.
---
I really like the maps. Are they still posted somewhere?
---
And all our uncles work for Blizzard.
---
&gt;Hey,
---
&gt;So it looks like I've upset quite a few people
---
Step 1: Fuck em.
---
Step 2: There is no step 2.
---
You do you, boo.
---
There will undoubtedly be some way to see what raid progression somebody has and as there are no achievements it’s going to be 3rd party
---
That would produce an ocean of "Me too" and other idea-less comments.
---
Sorry to hear that you don't understand how analogies work. Lucky for you it is very simple, all you have to do is change the symbolic words to the actual words.
---
All you have to do is change:
---
 * "bbq restauraunt" to: "this sub"
---
 * "pork ribs" to: "theorycrafting"
---
 * "LOUD NOISES" to: the nonsensical garbage that keeps coming out of you.
---
Make sense to you now?
---
&gt; Please continue what you were doing
---
Fuck it, $5 here to do EPL. Do even more.
---
I don't remember the specifics of what level I was, but in early Vanilla I was questing in Duskwood before I realized what hotkeys were and had solely been a clicker until that point.
---
I'm pretty bummed about this news because I was looking forward to looking at some more of those maps. Why don't we create a seperate subreddit for them?
---
I said pretty clearly there were exceptions.
---
For example they went in game to move you every time you got stuck, they just stayed invis for those types of things.  If a GM did show themselves it likely was a fairly large deal, a game breaking bug they needed to see, or progression where it's necessary to watch to see if there are bugs/encounters being exploited.  The Zul Gurub plague I mentioned before was the prime example, you had to see it to understand it and GMs had to manually quarantine people in locations players couldn't get to solve the problem.
---
The overwhelming majority of interactions with a GM weren't those types of things.  Most were harassment, known bugs, loot/character restoration and moving stuck players.  Outside of stuck players and the aforementioned scenarios where they did show themselves, GMs didn't go in game.
---
I would be very surprised if there aren't enough GMs to handle the major issues they still need to be in game to resolve.  A lot of their automation was based around solving the issues they were getting tickets about the most.
---
As a priest, realized I could dispel mage shield. Embarrassingly. Late. 
---
US to EU is going to be lower ping than US to OCE for no other reason than distance.  Even if you assume you're in California, it's still a shorter distance to a French/German/etc. server than an Australian one.
---
You can say fuck on the internet, mommy won’t know.
---
Hmm I think it was called Titans Bar at the top. Then I see Raid Assist and CT scan.
---
Can I ask why you have a general disdain for melee? I’m mostly interested in warlock, mage, and warrior, people seem to speak so highly of warrior gameplay I was considering making one (I might make a couple characters) even though I usually make casters in games.
---
thats_the_joke.bmp
---
Do what you want. Think, what would Joel Osteen do? "Eh, fuck em"
---
Just because somebody has a different opinion to you doesn’t mean you can immediately dismiss them as a troll.
---
Some people will complain about and belittle anything. You need to learn to not take it personally, because it's less about you and more about them.
---
I kind of like it
---
It makes quests like benediction actually hard to accomplish because you have to worry about interruptions. Thats more difficult than anything mechanically this game has ever had to offer
---
all future content will be posted at /r/wow
---
the support from everyone is fantastic,
---
but I think i'll just take the content elsewhere.
---
There are videos of people streaming bgs from Pservers. Specify a YouTube search for hour+ videos. Sure you can find something.
---
Doesn't the items require you to have the type of engineering before equipping them?
---
Also worth mentioning you could get a cheap mount (something like 80g?) if you achieved Commander PvP rank (IIRC this was rank 10?).  That was a hell of a grind though, I can tell you.
---
seriously, people underestimate the hell out of mobility. (despite +8% speed being regarded as the most important enchant in pvp)
---
I often did flag runs in WSG with my level 29 hunter, because pretty much nobody could catch me. it's not like 60, when you start running while others mount up... if you're gone, you're gone.
---
how do druids measure up at 29, with something like 0/13/7? what I'm a bit worried about is damage - hunters and other classes have OP weapons they can get their hands on, while druids aren't that lucky.
---
Damn, that sucks. I certainly won't be subbing there
---
Who you want me kill?
---
I learned about Anberlin when I met a character named "Anberlin" in Silithus.  Downloaded their albums from Napster (or whatever we used at the time) and listened to them while grinding those quests.
---
Ret was short for retarded, so it counts
---
I stopped playing end game in Data and ran 70 twinks until I quit around the timeless isle patch of mop. Honestly, the 70's community was so good back then that it was hands down my favorite era of wow.
---
I remember running a 70 subtlety rogue in full pve BiS and doing just shy of 12k dps. Hemo swords was such a fun spec to run, and keeping up a rotation of 4 finishing moves was so much better than the mindless rotation of my old level capped characters.
---
I really miss it.
---
Dude is the ultimate attention whore lol.
---
Whole post reeks of a self pity party wanting to be complimented.
---
"hurhurhur my maps arent good enough" "DONT APOLOGIZE! MAPS R GUD"
---
Good riddance, they were garbage by Inkarnate standards anyways.
---
They could go the WoD way of making a completely new timeline or just explain that Classic takes place in the caverns of time.
---
In vanilla you couldn't learn riding until level 40. That's your standard 60% unarmored mount. The epic/armored 100% speed mounts are available at level 60. This was changed to level 20 and 40, respectively, a couple expansions later.
---
That's so weird. It seemed like the haters were just terrified that you might get credit for doing something. I recall that some loser posted links to the tool on every thread like it was some public service.
---
As a Horde player, I can tell you with the utmost certainty that the only thing hard about Sylvannas is people knowing how to get around Undercity. There is also a "side entrance" which is lightly guarded which allows Alliance to push through pretty quickly, assuming, once again, that they know how to get around.
---
Varimathras is a bit of a pain, but similar to Vol'Jin beside Thrall, nothing that can't be dealt with by a decent raid.
---
I think the most fun raid (assuming he is tethered) would be trying to kill Cairne. There isn't a "shortcut" to Cairne per se (just the most direct path) so you would definitely have to fight through a bunch of guards and NPC's to get a swing at him. Would be a blast.
---
I've been lifting weights for the past ten years in preparation for this
---
r/ImaginaryAzeroth
---
Wrath killed WoW, I'll never understand the love it gets.
---
Classic and BC all the way
---
Preach. After cata...I was never the same. 
---
At level 40 you will be able to purchase your 60% speed unarmored mount.
---
At level 60 you will be able to purchase your 100% speed epic mount.
---
I'm not sure if you're referring to epic mounts that were not available until level 60 in vanilla, or the original epic mounts that were unarmored. If you're referring to the original epic mounts that were later replaced with armored models, we don't yet know if Blizz is going to include them in any capacity with the other epic mounts.
---
what
---
You know /r/Classicwow has nothing better going on when people start to complain about maps. Is this even considered drama? Is this why Chris Metzen left Blizzard? Because of dumbass wow fanboys like this? My magic 8 ball tells me to ask again later.
---
Ret seems really fun to me. A support spellcaster who can occasionally become completely immune to damage and CC, pop a speed pot, and 1 shot a healer of their choice.
---
While that gameplay is right up my alley, leveling a ret paladin and convincing a guild to give me loot sounds like a struggle I'm just not ready for.
---
As I see it, yes
---
I have really enjoyed them. Fuck the haters
---
I was concerned about the Elemental Invasion myself. I hope it’s not included at launch and instead in Phase 2/3.
---
I know im in the minority but I dont like cinematics. It immediately breaks my immersion and reminds me im playing a video game instead of existing in the world
---
This. SO much this.
---
There’s s good chance that the entire private server theorycrafting becomes useless since none of Jen had 100% accurate data
---
That being said , play what you want  
---
In a way, Vanilla WoW is a rehashed topic itself.  You know, with private servers and all.
---
It was damn.
---
Would you rather we talk about sharding for the 50th time
---
Hey I really liked your maps and I don't mind the clutter
---
"...  I have deleted all content from Reddit. "
---
sadness.jpg
---
The maps were wonderful. Forget the whiny babies, post e'eryday. yolomapswag
---
Those maps are badass, dont listen to the jealous haters. 
---
I save every single one. 
---
I mean youre part of the problem by complaining about nothing. 
---
Well, I disagree pretty strongly. I think it's terrible design to screw a player out of completing a quest because someone tried to help.
---
It would have made far more sense to simply make them invincible to anyone else once a hunter engages.
---
Oof, online people are cheaper and don't break things as often though! I'm pretty excited about a new beginning though, I think it will be part of the experience again.
---
Yeah we really need more "what race/class are you picking" and 4 pixel screenshots/videos from Molten Core. That's the good content. 
---
Oooof- painful to watch
---
Another reason wotlk should’ve been the last expansion 
---
“How are hunters in vanilla?”
---
i just recently resubbed because i was jonesing for it but i dipped at mop. Cata was frustrating because I had almost entirely explored the world as it was, and then everything changed and that was extremely difficult for me to process :/ but gameplay wise, i held on until mop and then i just got bored. hoping that they take us all the way through wrath with classic
---
Yeah can't wait to get cone of colded for half my hp
---
Well said. Mirrors my thoughts on the 49 bracket,
---
Imo, it's by far the most fun and balanced of the twink brackets.
---
Unless the armory tracks your raid progress then probably not because there would be nothing to track. Ilvl is so tight nit that a score wouldn't matter unless we're talking a jump between mc and aq
---
Ya like up to 50/80 k hp at ice crown with 2 stam trinkets, gems etc... I'm pretty sure those amounts like up with my blood dk. Man blood was amazing in wrath tank and dps(more fun than frost I thought)
---
x-realm BGs/battlegroups will almost certainly exist, so it's very likely we'll see active twink PvP for 19-49.
---
My room mate is the resident IT guy of our friends. Poor, poor bastard. I may not know a lot about fixing but at least I maintain my devices. 
---
freeze, cone of cold crit, use cold snap, do it again, ggwp vanilla was balanced
---
Mine was realizing you had to purchase each upgrade to your spells. Lvl1 spells don’t work so great on lvl 20 mobs. 
---
I wasn't old enough to truly get into WoW when I first got it, but I do remember one moment when a Hyacinth Macaw dropped for me and a friend of mine told me it sold for "lots of money" on the auction house. I was a total noob at the time and had no idea how much gold it was worth and didnt even think to check the AH for other sellers to compare prices. 
---
I sold it for 5 gold. 
---
I live with this regret every day.
---
You sound like a girl that's talking hatefully about a guy she secretly wants to get dicked down by.
---
I have found it fun and rewarding. 
---
Me either. New PC is built, I actually caved in and used gold to buy retail game time just to get used too a keyboard and mouse again. After 3 years of not playing on PC I'm very rusty. Playing with binds is fun
---
Why is no mount such a factor? I feel like you should be able to afford a mount by 49 easily
---
I really don’t have passion for games anymore, but classic has me all giddy inside (to the point I made this post). Can. Not. Wait.
---
Off tanking is fun. It is what I enjoy doing. 
---
If you like 5 mans you can. I spent most of my time on non raid nights helping guildies with pre raid BIS. 
---
Two and a half*. WOTLK was only amazing in the beginning, and half the mechanics of the raids.  The turning point was doing Wrath, not before or after.
---
I think the following expansions were just so bad that WOTLK looks good 
---
People in the chat? talking? to other people??? what game is this?
---
&gt;Sure they are. People want Classic, but want to prevent everyone else from playing their favorite expansion, are worse than the people who want only Live to exist. 
---
Thats the common attitude tho, people want Vanilla -&gt; Wrath, but Cata? No
---
I love how you defend bc doing it by saying “it was end of expansion” then in the literal next sentence you talk about 5 man heroics outgearing ulduar; so the final patch end of wotlk expansion. Jesus Christ. 
---
1. Log in to battle.net 
---
2. Join one of the many bot hosted custom games.
---
3. Sit alone for 2 hours while 1-4 people will join to download the map and then instantly leave.
---
4. Cry.
---
hot fresh take
---
The way I look at it: Being able to start the rank 14 grind gives people something to aspire and look forward to. A decent amount of people play vanilla for the pvp, and I think not implementing the honor system for several months would be a turn off for them. It would also give other people stuff to do between MC and the launch of BWL.
---
I know the weapons are powerful, but only a small number of people would get them during the stage that theyre extra retarded. At that point is the trade off worth it? I think it is. Vanilla isn't exactly known for being balanced anyway. That was the idea behind the patch 1.8.0 ranking change; have honor system implemented but reduce the amount of people that get to 14 on top of that.
---
I know it's not the perfect solution, but I think it's a good starting point and gives some ideas about how it could be handled.
---
As for the smaller faction getting destroyed on pvp servers: that's going to happen anyway. It's vanilla.
---
Sylvannas is a difficult city boss not because of Varim, but because of all the damn honor guards and the fact that anyone queueing BGs from UC will come out of the BG directly into your raid.  
---
Cairne is often voted as the easiest boss to raid on horde. You can go in there and nab him with 10-15 people and no one even notices.  
---
There's no way in hell I'm grinding to R11 with a 60% mount.  
---
I vaguely remember a tower, not sure if it was added later on tho. All I remember is I had to deliver this guy's lunch! 
---
I wouldn't even join a MC pug tbh, 20 mans are fine. But the 40 man requires better synergy and a strong leader.
---
If its a semi-pug where half the people are uber geared and know wtf they are doing, its doable. But a full pug? complete waste of time.
---
No, the sites for retail are due to gear not being a viable metric to determine if your are competent.
---
In vanilla your gear and guild name is the make or break to gwtting into a pug
---
Yo I'm just passing by this thread and wanted to let you know that you seem like a complete douche
---
Wait. So you’re telling me that every time I used unstuck as a child when I got jammed in between a tree and a mountain, trapped in a root, or fell in a ditch whilst exploring the world, and every time I just used unstuck for fun to stare at the animation or role play, an actual person came to my “aid”...
---
In vanilla your gear and guild name is the make or break to getting into a pug
---
That being said the only people who hate raider.io etc. Are bad players who think they are entitled to be carried and not need to learn how to actually play. Take that for what you will
---
Isn't it funny how every fan of anything has a different definition of the golden age? There was a blurb in MAD About the Seventies that really stuck with me, it's that people will always say that the golden age of something was when they first discovered it so take every opinion on when something was at it's peak with a grain of salt.
---
I really enjoyed Wrath. I'm not a raider but I enjoyed BGs. 
---
I do feel that the game got a bit too easy, like in the starting areas. 
---
* The mobs that were red got changed to yellow in Northshire Abby. 
---
* Spells like Druid's wrath went from 20 mana to 5 mana. 
---
The game really got easier but I started to care about the story. I really wanted to fight Arthas. Never did. 
---
MoP was actually my favorite expansion thematically. Really seems like a love it/hate it kind of expansion.
---
Do you know roughly what ping Americans get to Europe? Just curious
---
Seriously. Especially with the news in past week and a half. Me and my 4 lifelong IRL best friends are all playing together and we have a discord just for us to constantly shoot classic wow stuff between each other. I know it's relatively close (3-6 month) but I wish I could literally countdown the days. Gunna lose my ish when they release an official date.
---
39 ele shaman. Everone sees a shaman and expects you to run up and pray for a wf proc. Then you unload 2k damage in 5.5s from range
---
Oh my gosh I literally cant even !
---
I too was an elemental shaman on Azshara in vanilla! Talk about nostalgia
---
ICC was so fun back then to me. And after a good wintergrasp (I think that’s what the PvP area was called) victory, going beat those big elemental guys. I look back with find memories of those things. That legendary mammoth mount only dropped once for me and I think I rolled a 13... man I miss playing. 
---
Sometimes I wish I'd deleted my old main just because of how embarrassing the name was... Annihalator
---
Fuck me. I didn't even spell it correctly. Needless to say I'm glad I won't be 12 this time.
---
I think he should be rogue too.
---
Why is this not a machinima it would be hilarious
---
There were great things about Wrath. Some aspects were even better than Vanilla/BC. But at the time it was easy to complain about the few things that were different and worse. Just human nature.
---
On the counter part. I didn't know what /emotes we're for the longest time. My first class was a rogue. I remember when I got to org there was a question where I had to type /salute. I didn't get it. Spend forever thinking maybe there was an item nearby or something in my bags I had to read first. So confused. Only to realize you could use emotes months later. By then I had my druid to lvl 60.  
---
As someone that farmed thorium veins for arcane crystals for my paladin’s epic mount back in the day, reading this gives me nightmares
---
Also you can sell items! I was deleting all junk in my bags or not picking stuff up. Someone in a party in a dungeon asked me why I never picked up trash items. Whoops. Missed it on all that silver! 
---
Technically you werent ret.
---
I was a level 41 holy paladin before I realised there wasnt just the holy tree.
---
There were actually a bunch of quests for silithus, they were mostly chains, with a horde chain beginning way back in shimmering flats and an alliance chain from darnassus.
---
But there wasn’t much. 
---
The first time i tanked I thought I had to ask for heals. Every time. Like the idea of looking at the group window didn’t occur to me or something. So I had an elite keybound asking for heals. 
---
I ran deadmines with that emote. 
---
I can only imagine looking back that people were so desperate for a tank that they stayed through to the end. 
---
I did the same thing. Saved money to buy a really cool white staff from booty bay. Sold my green staff with stats and everything, but the white staff had more dps! I was a feral druid. 
---
Lol cmon man. I had a level 60 rogue in 8/8 bloodfang, and downed several bosses in Naxx before I quit. Was the game hard back then? Yes, but that was cause no one knew anything.
---
Now we know all the mechanics, have all the BIS list figured out, and people use 1000x consumables, and world buffs. Rag will be dead in two weeks. 
---
I started playing with a friend who went hunter and myself rogue. He got a pet so naturally I also wanted one too. Saw the vendor selling rabbits for gold. So I kept killing the spiders in the NELF starting zone till i had enough gold. Took me a couple of hours. I loved it. Got my pet and couldn't work out how to make it attak. Googled it. Was disappointed.
---
Ooh this one wins. 
---
No, only the instances where auto unstuck couldn't cover it.  If you had to file a GM ticket over it they had to go in game and move you manually.
---
I think it's even a loading screen tip now lol. I remember going through that 
---
You never check your bank account history?
---
I assume your misunderstanding comes from the fact that you have not played TBC.
---
If you did, you'd know that the gear sold in Sunwell Plateau was **also** not a replacement to raiding. It was just an even bigger boost than the regular badges, dude.
---
It required an absurd amount of badges. You could at most buy one or two pieces of gear. In WotLK, Trial of the Champion instantly invalidated every single piece of gear you received from Ulduar unless it was 25 man. Same goes for Reflection--it invalidated every single piece of gear you received that wasn't Trial of the Grand Champion.
---
You instantly lose your progression. People who have just hit 80 are suddenly **just as well geared as you.**
---
It took you **weeks** to get a **single item** from the Badges of Justice vendor. I think I only managed to buy like, what, fucking two items from the Isle of Quel'danas vendor before WotLK launched? You're equating this to HOR/POS/third thing, that in a span of a week entirely replaced every single item you had equipped??
---
Whoa check out the huge dick on this internet tough guy-- you sure showed that dork, bro! Hell yeah!
---
I'm not going to say Blizzard shouldn't make Cata -&gt; Legion.
---
I will say they probably won't, because I don't think there's enough market for it.  If they make a Cata server I won't tell them they shouldn't.  I won't be upset and quit TBC because a Cata server came out.  
---
TBC content is vastly changed.  They've removed attunements, added in level scaling, and changed how everything works on your way up.  Plus, stuff that took months to get in TBC...you can have your main farm in about 5 minutes in BFA.  
---
Then there's the classes themselves, which are completely different.  At the very least, Resto druids have an actual rez, Paladins can AoE heal, and you have Monks.  Mana has been completely reworked, tanking has been completely reworked, dispels have been rebalanced, and stats completely changed.
---
The raw content might still be there, but it's been butchered by the changes that affect everyone else.
---
Even if you cap at 70 and stick to TBC content, while you're leveling 1-60 everything is Cataclysm, and all your greens cost 1200g because transmog.
---
Okay mate, tell me. Before ulduar? During ulduar? How about naxxramas patch and ulduar? You are shitting on the end of wotlk, most players will tell you the end of wotlk is when wow took its shit turn. Start and middle of wrath was prime wow
---
Good stuff. I’ve heard the “viability” of SPriest in PvE shifts a bit with patches. Does the news that we won’t start on 1.12 change anything?
---
What is the difficulty / strategies for the Ally leaders? I'm not very familiar with that direction.
---
And locks had to keep corruption, siphon life, and Co"X" on everything. 
---
That's not how it worked. There was only 1 rank of "riding" before the mounts changed, and they were all different for each race. 
---
There was no 75 and 150 universal riding.
---
If you had an old epic mount before the system changed you got the newly added 150 universal riding for free.
---
If you didn't have an epic mount you now had to pay 1000g for the 150 universal riding.
---
In Raiding?
---
With 16 debuffs you can have some locks taking a few spare slots for Corruption, with definitely not Siphon Life.
---
Maxing, and doing everything, in RuneScape takes exponentially longer than it does in wow. 
---
I'm really hoping they release it at least mid summer so i can waste away before school..
---
Neither am I because I only killed one in vanilla. I know with Archbishop you can just go to the basement of the church and summon a raid then pull him down there and kill him without anyone noticing.  
---
You can kill the Darnassus bosses with no interference at all, just tank and spank.  
---
Magni and SW King are the hardest. There are many vanilla servers where they never died.  
---
Magni is so hard because the entire alliance population is just on the otherside of his wall hanging out in IF's open square area. He also has a lay on hands that throws people for a loop when you get him real low.  
---
SW king I'm not sure about.  
---
Gnome boss is a tank and spank and you can just pull him into one of the four side rooms and it's over before anyone even reacts.  
---
Still makes you motion sick.
---
I don't understand your question...?
---
Catch up mechanics cannot exist in the first tier of content lol. Ulduar did not open a new 5 man dungeon that invalidated Naxxramas.
---
And anyway who the fuck thought tier 1 WotLK was any good? Malygos and obsidian sanctum, literally 2 new bosses, and an entire 100% rehashed Naxxramas. Who in the world liked that?
---
Ulduar was spectacular, where did I ever say otherwise? In fact, in another comment somewhere in this thread, I explicitly praised Wrath of the Lich King for having absolutely amazing encounters--Obsidian, Malygos, Ulduar, ICC, fuck, even TotGC wasn't too shabby. The problem were **decisions** undertaken in WotLK. The problem was the **content invalidation** they introduced with Trial of the Champion.
---
My new PC is coming soon. Already have new monitors and a sit/stand motor adjustable desk. Just need the unit itself. I'm pretty thrilled. I've been planning and preparing every day since around December.  
---
The game hasn't even come out and I'm already no lifing Classic.  
---
I'm really interested in playing warrior in classic, if I remember correctly there were arms warrior raiding for off tank they would just equip shield and sword and when they didn't need to off tank they would 2h arms? Or was it fury? Anyways any input would be nice. I don't mind main tanking but to becareful I don't know what my schedule would look like so off tanking would be smarter choice.
---
You can ask them to freeze it.
---
I used to take pride in kiting warriors to death as a low level hunter, especially in AV
---
If you're looking for a free flow of ideas, don't turn to private server based minmaxers. 
---
Most guilds only ran two, maybe three locks. Rogues told to use instants.
---
1. Rolling Ignite
---
2. Curse of Elements
---
3. Curse of Weakness
---
4. 3 Corruptions
---
7. 3 Siphons
---
10. Sunder Armor
---
That left 6 slots for seals on alliance, Hunter stings, etc. Lock DPS was already shit enough. Had to get every bit out of them. 
---
Make sure to get Waterworks (Resto) for team coverage. /s
---
The clear answer here is Orc Warlock. 
---
Yes please bring back city raids, best times on vanilla were had doing stuff like that and the giant alliance vs horde fuck fest that was world boss encounters
---
Pserver owners have said themselves that they aren't really blizzlike since they don't have all the data. That should tell enough.
---
I have had this done quite a few times. Yeah call them. As long as you didnt log in, they are good at refunding chunks of time.
---
So we both agree that it wasn’t in the game. The only way loot was traded was via special permission through game masters. They didn’t always change it. There were plenty of people crying in trade about it.
---
I'm gonna go out on a lark to guess there won't be anywhere near as many servers for classic WoW as there was back in vanilla. Sharding for the first month in places like Valley of Trials sounds preferable to hundreds of players clustering in Valley of Trials like quadriplegic murlocs.
---
I used to play Oceanic and had consistent 200+ latency. NOT worth it under any circumstances beyond living in those areas. 
---
I don't like melee because they're overly simple and don't allow for interesting solo or group play. With the exception of rogues, they also don't have the ability to control their enemies like a caster does. I like melee in other incarnations of wow, just not the one from 2005/2006. 
---
Even though I don't like warriors, they're a very solid class. They can dish out a lot of damage and do well in premade bgs. They're a free kill solo most of the time. Especially when they're at equal or lower gear than their opponent. 
---
/leave 1
---
Instead of traditional sharding where things can pop in/out right in front of your eyes, I propose the following. Shard Realms by number (Sargeras 1, Sargeras 2) and merge them back together as the population/level spread changes. This will allow players to group with their friends (meet together on the Server/#) without needing to join group and essentially teleport to another world to be able to see each other. The Server fractures could be combined as needed until launch day/week is over and they all merge together to Just "Sargeras".
---
2 years is the estimated length of classics content based on the length of real vanilla world of warcraft.
---
&gt; 15 days max before a guild declares Rag is down, 20 at the longest.
---
Sit crit procs were removed at some point in vanilla and were not present in the demo. They're unlikely to be in the game. As far as other information, we're not really going to know anything definitive before the inevitable beta or launch of the game. 
---
I always thought Wrath should have led to another RTS.
---
&gt;I will say they probably won't, because I don't think there's enough market for it.
---
Maybe not for Cata in perticular, but MoP and Legion were both popular expansions, and people might get nostalgic about cata as well a few years down the line if they do classic progression.
---
So if they do I anticipate them to go all the way
---
&gt;The raw content might still be there, but it's been butchered by the changes that affect everyone else.
---
Yes, but thats the same for literally every expansion. The gameplay always changes.
---
&gt;Even if you cap at 70 and stick to TBC content, while you're leveling 1-60 everything is Cataclysm, and all your greens cost 1200g because transmog.
---
1-60 wasn't TBC tho, besides some bonus quests in Dustwallow march I believe.
---
part of the entire history and balance, shatter combos were a bug also i think, or a product of latency, multiple spells proccing off a broken freeze due to server times to respond, now its a famous tactic.
---
I think it was more of population issue. In my hourly run around Burning Steppes and similar mining location I could meet like 2-5 ppl, not all of whom were miners
---
Mages being Blizzards favorite isn't a meme for no reason. They have everything. Blink is INSANE (if you don't clip a rock or fall through the world) in vanilla. Instant nukes for mobile DPS, a 1 second cast range snare, immobilize, invulnerability, damage absorption x2, 2+ mana bars with evo and gem, hard cc, spell lock+silence, 2 reliable stealth breaks you can spam, resist armor and anti melee armor (the atk speed slow on ice armor is great), free food and water...the only real downside is that in raids you hit one button, even if you decide to go fire. Frostbolt or Fireball.  BUT that being said, their dynamite play style in dungeons, pvp, and solo (you can even AE grind!) far outweighs the somewhat boring abilities you use in raids. Seeing as how, even as a hardcore raider, your play time will mostly be outside of that particular area (and in 20 man raids you will have a lot more fun as they play much more similar to group content) Mage is easily the most versatile class in WoW, and they only fill one role. Yes, they are the best class in the game (they also beat Warriors 99% of the time, let's not forget that.)
---
My point is that the experience of TBC was more than just Outlands.  It was still 80% Vanilla content, and it was TBC balance which was unique unto itself.
---
To say that TBC exists in the game but Vanilla doesn't, the only difference is that the Vanilla zones have been changed.  The experience is completely different.
---
&gt; Has blizzard annouced any server info?
---
No.
---
Depends on server population. Probably will be attempts at making one, won't be near as useful for vanilla.
---
The game isn't changing or being developed akin to back in vanilla. Can't get water from a stone. No one today is wondering about juicy possibilities for the games development or asking exciting questions like "I wonder when/if our talent trees will get redesigned?" or "what/when is the next raid coming out?! My guildie got some crazy new item omg!" or even "They nerfed Rogues, LOL!" etc... I mean some entire shows of Blue Plz or The Instance were spent with them debating theories and upcoming content, how spells work or are changing, or what some unknown raid is going to be.
---
With a few tiny wrinkles, it's a known quantity 'museum piece' - so people have nothing to talk about that hasn't been discussed previously. I reckon once launch happens you'll see the podcasts get better.
---
I can't remember if it was something a lot of people did in vanilla but it's certainly a very popular method for groups on private servers, so I wouldn't expect it to be a problem in classic either.
---
It's not like people are going to revert their brains to 2005 when classic comes out, even if a lot of people don't know how to do lava runs as long as you have the knowledge and set up a group for it you can teach it to others very quick, it's not something extremely complicated to do.
---
I accidentally clicked forward slash and thought my character was tired and continued to play doing the RP walk for like 4 hours and was pleased to find that one I logged back on it was gone. 
---
I did it a few times and thought I had to take a break so my character would get rest....
---
Dude loot trading sucked and was never in vanilla. Blues are huge in Vanilla. You’ll do 30 Ubrs runs and still need 15 more to finish getting the stuff you need. If people are ganging up and loot trading it’s going to extra suck in vanilla. The way it was in vanilla was perfect I’ll be really bummed if they implement this.
---
What if i just adapt to it
---
I think the nostalgia argument is usually bullshit but I think it really does apply to Wrath. Or maybe (I love this word) wrathbabies are just remembering when they first came to the game before it got even shittier, and honestly that's more than fair. But:
---
Death Knights broke the entire balance of WoW, PvE and PvP alike, for half a decade. 
---
Heroics were downgraded from pre-bis relevant, challenging gameplay (remember council fight on heroic magisters terrance?) to a base-level treadmill progression step that you did as soon as you hit max level.
---
Purposeless, unsubtle stick-carroted dailies out the absolute ass in every single fucking zone, often for raiding necessities like enchants or something. (I don't really remember the specifics of this one that well, but I remember feeling forced to do Storm Peaks dailies.)
---
Achievements which turned the joy of multiplayer RPG and subsequently implicit joy of overcoming challenges and coming to respect other players through experience into a series of certification checks. Oh, you think you're good? Link x achievement and the date better be before mine or you're shit. Yeah, I'm glad some minute percentage of players got their dicks hard looking at achievements points and the thinnest possible veiling on a reason to do something in the game, though I wish they'd have just made a fucking IRC channel with a public spreadsheet with their own obscure point system so the rest of us didn't have to suffer for it.
---
Rehashed, nerfed and mechanically gutted Naxx should have been a revolting insult to absolutely everyone, let alone those who raided 40naxx and spat in the face of anyone who said "lots of people didn't see 40naxx". WoW was so huge at the time and coming off a massively successful expansion that they didn't give a shit. They said "try and bitch about it," and everyone bent over.
---
Ulduar was overhyped garbage. People were just glad it Wasn't Fisher Price Naxx and didn't want to admit it sucked. The first fight was an absolute shitfest beta test of vehicle testing. Algalon was great, but the rest were just pushovers you'd kill in 3 pulls or in 2 hours if you did the "optional hardmode". Algalon was great. Firefighter was ok, but it should've just been the original fight. You literally had to exploit or class stack Yogg 0 to kill it. It wasn't fun, it was stupid and hamfisted.
---
"Optional hardmodes" which in turn started this whole forty-nine difficulty tier system. It was fine for dungeons in BC, because the dungeons were ALREADY HARD and finding out you had to do them to literally attune for raids forced you to go shit your pants and deal with some of the best dungeon design they ever made.
---
Gear becoming irrelevant in droves every new tier. TotGC was also shit. ICC and it's tied-in dungeons were admittedly pretty awesome, but the playerbase had to suffer obvious cost-cutting and an outright terrible expansion for 2 years just to see it. That whole last patch felt very weird, like it was the only part of WotLK that was designed by the BC team.
---
Dungeon Finder was miserable shit, but the real damage it did was that the people using it to do randomly matched pugs were so bad that the clear rates were ABYSMAL. Blizzard had to nerf dungeons en masse to compensate for the awful clear rates because it was either gut the already piss easy dungeons or admit you spent the last year cutting costs to develop a fucking matchmaker that your playerbase is too shit to use because people spent the last 3 and a half versions of the game using socializing as a vehicle for comraderie. People didn't mind carrying people who were obviously bad if they met in the world and were talking to each other.
---
It started dying to me in TBC and Wrath officially ended it for me.  Once "dailies" and "heroics" were introduced, I checked out.  For some reason, those were the mechanic that took me out of the game.  Kharazhan was a great instance.  Shattrath broke up the Azeroth to the point where the original continents felt empty and the gear you got while leveling 1-60 was not trivialized.
---
What about healers then?
---
No, it is you who is wrong
---
If I used to play classic WoW will I need to buy a new copy?  Or does my email still have some sort of connection to my blizzard acct?
---
I did this on my priest main leveling through tbc and wotlk, and i was always broke. My mate noticed one day that I didn't have an epic mount after 60 and gave me the gold.

I'm really not sure what was point of your comment.
---
"Hey I'm being forced to rename my character after the merge WTF!!"
---
Didn't use any shadow abilities on my priest, thinking it would affect her good/evil alignment. IIRC i gave up around lvl 17 and rolled a hunter.

Always comes in 3's just like with EQ - Kunark and Velious! For those that played that too.

That's fine, but then why are you participating in a discussion where people are comparing vanilla and BC to the version of the game where you started? You literally don't even have the personal capacity of experience or perspective to oppose your own arguments.
---
"Facts don't care about your feelings." - Michael Scott
---
I PVP'd as a Resto Shaman during TBC in 2's and 3's arena at \~2400 rating (this is the RDruid glory days FYI). It's certainly doable but 180ms isn't optimal. During Vanilla I had a 500-600ms ping since SSH tunneling hadn't been discovered yet.
---
I don't agree, to me TBC was prime WoW. In WotLK heroics were already meaningless (with regards to difficulty) and welfare epics were also extremely easy to get. Attunements were removed as well (I realise not everybody likes those, but to me there were a good thing). Questing was fun, so that was ok at least. I don't really like the 10 and 25 man raiding split that happened for each raid. I personally thought having separate 10-man (20-man) and 25-man (40-man) raids were a better approach, like during Vanilla and TBC. Also resistance requirements were removed from bosses, crafting specialisations, the list goes on and on. 
---
I still enjoyed WotLK, but in my opinion TBC was WoW at it's peak. TBC should be (IMHO) what every MMO should aspire to be.
---
I hope we have the technology to reserve the name on Sargeras2 when the character is created on Sargeras1
---
There's only one Server in the situation, it's just sharded in a way that lets you click which one you go to.
---
Having a rockbiter on my weapon as shaman. I was enh that use ele skills to level up, and used 1h weapon + shield with the shield talent + stamina talents.
---
Lvl 38 holy shit thats insane XD missing out on quite a lot back then with that :P 
---
it will be june/july defintely
---
arms is not rly good for tanking  
---
and 2h fury isn't good either (horde can get away with slam spec)   
---
odds are high that u MT as fury anways  
---
here is a little video for u it may help [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfG03VQZUYU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfG03VQZUYU)
---
There's only one Server, no name conflicts will arise becasue they share the same name list. Shards will be added as starter zones fill up, and combined as they disperse. You may come back the next day and rather than Sargeras 1-20, there's just 5 to choose from and only 1 and 2 are full.
---
I don’t see why they would change anything.
---
I think a large portion of the player base returning to classic wow will be oldschool players,   
---
I would think that most of them are probably expecting to see twinks in pvp brackets,
---
I can remember a time where people would deliberately level up and gear alts into twinks just because the other faction had a reputation in a particular bracket,   
---
one server I played on was wholly dedicated to the 19/29 brackets and had around  50 active players, and the Alliance side had even more again,  
---
I just kind of see it like I see end game BGs, if someones in AQ gear and I'm not, I just have more PvE goals I need to work towards.
---
I can however see this effecting new players jumping into classic the first time and being in for a nasty surprise.
---
I just can't see a way to implement a fix because you're going to be changing the vanilla experience.
---
They made the game so much worse afterwards so woltk looks pure.
---
As an Australian who raided during Vanilla I'd argue the opposite. If there is only 1-2 guilds on your server raiding 4am and they're full of your class then you're out of luck. If there is 50+ guilds raiding at your time then you'll be fine. When the physically-USA but Oceanic labelled servers first launched it killed AUS raid times on nearly every server, with only a couple holdouts (i.e. Blackrock).
---
Clearly someone has never enjoyed twinking 
---
If you are not having mana problems then all is well.
---
I already had my priest in the high 50's before I heard of the smite spec, now I have heard half a dozen people tell me it is 'not as optimal' since then. Mana being the given reason. If I ever make another priest I will 100% be doing the smite build, with a keyboard macro to click the button infinitely.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. As pointed out most People that talk about twinking claims that they really just want to face each other.
---
Levelling is a big part of Classic and that goes for PvP during levelling too. I remember how much fun I had when the bgs showed up. If there are a bunch of twinks in every bracket it really takes the fun out of bgs for everyone else.
---
The twinkers can get their fix in Redridge etc instead. It must be even more fun for them when they are 20 levels higher.
---
They wont change this for sure 
---
Most fun I had was 49 bracket. My brother was an arms war, I was an rdruid. We spent months in that bracket until leveling out. Felt like a pocketed warrior was a god.
---
Good info(and ur math dumb) OP. This old thread has some more numbers on just how good grinding is:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7n23dn/grinding_xp_grid_amount_of_mobs_you_need_to_kill/
---
Those numbers add up to just above 15.3k same level mobs killed to hit 60. At 30 seconds per mob including regen time, that comes out to ~5.5 days /played until 60 for *any* class, which is really really fast. Even giving yourself a very generous extra 1.5 days for looting, skinning(if you were to skin every single one of those 15.3k mobs, that alone would add a huge ~13 hours to your total time!), moving to new areas, a few corpse runs here and there, buying new skills, having extra downtime while trying not to die of boredom from grinding etc., you're still hitting 60 in 7 days, well below average, and with much less of a headache than trying to come up with a good questing route and running all over the place all the goddamn time. So kill those mobs folks, you won't regret it.
---
Conclusion? If you can stand it, always kill absolutely every single mob you see that is your level and up to 2 levels below. It's probably faster than whatever else you're trying to do.
---
Ideally, you combine this with quests that have you kill mobs anyway: accept quest - kill everything on the way to where the quest mobs are - complete quest - kill everything again on the way back to hand-in.
---
Answer is : go to class discord channels. Druid discord channel is everyday active, they theorycraft even obscene and forbidden magic. Priest channel is quite good too.
---
Hell, for my money TBC was where the problems really started. Which isn't to say it was a bad product or poorly made; quite the opposite, I cheered for all the changes Blizz made to the game at the time and enjoyed the hell out of the expansion itself, but in hindsight I can see how it planted most of the seeds of the problems that would eventually rear their heads and kill my interest in playing.
---
From the new races' starting zones having a more narrative-driven experience in which your character was treated like the Champion of ~~Azeroth~~ your people, to the general focus of the game's design starting to shift toward endgame content over world content, to the arena fundamentally changing the nature of PvP from group-based fights balanced around a RPS design to mechanically homogenized classes and featureless items accommodating the competitive esports scene. And flying, of course, but as bad as that ultimately proved to be I honestly put it at the bottom of the list compared to the scope of the changes listed above.
---
I think it would be cool to see Blizz take inspiration from TBC/WotLK in creating new content for the game while keeping to the original philosophy of vanilla/Classic's design, but I'd hate to see them simply progress from Classic into BC/Wrath content without accounting for and addressing the ways each of them fundamentally altered the nature of the game. It would be a shame to have to give up the game again for the same reasons I did the first time after getting a second chance like this.
---
If it's the best three why is wrath of the shit king there?
---
Every so often I'm pleasantly reminded of the fact that I'll get to play through that glorious campaign in the remastered version. Mid- to late-2019 is gonna be fucking amazing.
---
Yeah there wasn’t much in Silithid before then.
---
Is that also when they added the world dragons? (Or whatever they’re called?)
---
you are right. but each xpac after made it so much worse, now Wotlk seems one of the best
---
Retail can have raider.io because Blizzard gives out the leaderboard/API data, so the site can verify that your character has successfully completed X content at Y levels. Without that option, such a website can't happen.
---
Don't get me wrong, elitists will find a way to be elitist, but not via classicraider.io or something
---
People will not need on items they don't need to trade to a friends, since they'll ruin their reputation on the realm and it's an exploit of their system (which is bannable).
---
Why do I know this? Because that's how it's been since the system was released. I don't speculate now, I go with facts. 
---
Do people seriously think Activision has anything to say about when it comes to Blizzard or is it just a meme I'm to rich to understand?
---
Enjoy being banned and having such a bad rep no guild or players will want to play with you. 
---
Ninja looting isn't exploiting, loot trading to steal items is and is bannable (it is on retail and it will be on vanilla).
---
I’m going by numbers, wotlk had the most concurrent players of any expansion. That being said, it is also my personal favourite, but that’s because I was a bit too young to fully appreciate bc, didn’t do much raiding. I mean purely in subscriptions, the peak was in wotlk and from cata onwards it was a downward trend. 
---
is this true?
---
BadgePlz destroyed the game. 
---
Also funny how polarising LFD was at the time. I fucking loved that feature, I guess because it worked pretty well for me. Now it's clear that it completely broke the immersion of the game.
---
Add me on Discord Crimsoneagle#3839!

a lot of these are so fucking stupid being 12 is not a valid excuse.

&gt;He even convinced the guild to let him have sulfuras but he barely used it

---
Let me know if you find something. I’m in the same time zone.
---
Was this changed in a late patch in vanilla? Because in the clips I have from Orgrimmar in 2005, there is actually a horde rogue shooting me with his gun while I am sitting to gain my Reckoning charges.   
---
I have been reading these statements ("It was only abusable on private servers because sitting would force a crit on you") more and more, but afaik this is not true. Unless it was added in a later vanilla patch.
---
holy shit that looks awful. i hate subs that just devolve into art posts. 
---
looks like you dont have financial issues so good for you lol
---
You seem to dislike Wotlk because its last patch had some bad features but Im pretty sure the entire expansion was more than the last patch. 
---
I raided hardcore during that expansion and Im very thankful I did because it had some of, if not the best raid in the entire game together with the best villain in WoWs history. 
---
Its very easy to understand how people love Wotlk if they played Warcraft before WoW. 
---
It's included with the regular WoW subscription so you're all set if you sub on release.
---
Well, thats you. Getting a realmfirst LK together with the end cinematics still gives me goosebumps when I think about it. Holy shit that was my best gaming memory. 
---
Nope, they only require X levels of Engineering. None of them are specialization as far as I can remember
---
How can we repay you for posting this? 
---
You get some mail at lvl 5ish
---
I thought it was because of a bug/oversight with the ignite talent
---
Start of wotlk was prime wow? What are you smoking? The worst tier of wow was exactly start of wrath. Naxxramas done in days, pvp in horrible state...
---
only ulduar and icc and pvp in the very end were good in wotlk. Everything else was horseshit.
---
This has nothing to do with Classic and won't affect it in any way. That'd be like saying Classic should expect 1g level 20 mounts because BFA has it for the "better of the game/community" (which is not happening).
---
Some of these players are literally leveling through BG's with heirlooms and junk.  It's a different game and has different rules.  I don't see any parallels to classic on this thread.
---
I dunno. If it is a bug it is still present in every private server after all these years.
---
DM:E jump runs with a healing buddy is easy cash. More so if one of you has enchanting. also you can sell the runs to people who need the satyr bow
---
I think I actually tried, and succeeded, running back from a MC or BWL wipe with my eyes closed.
---
Man I’m 100% on the same page. Everything you said here echoes my thoughts exactly. I’m desperate for classic news and discussion but this sub has a population of people that obviously want to approach the game in a different way than I do. 
---
I want theory, optimization and competitiveness. That’s just how I like to game. Frustrating that such an active community is made up of so few like minded people. I guess the sub’s mindset is inevitable as part of the general reddit population. 
---
Mm not bm?
---
RIP your guild's Vent server.
---
I loved getting to experience Naxx for the first time. I'd never had the chance to play classic itself, I joined in TBC, so the dream of getting to raid in the same place that dropped the legendary caster staff was fantastic.
---
That said, I agree Ulduar was fantastic and probably some of the most fun I'd ever had in WoW.
---
Totally agree with you. It’s hilarious how casual and anti-effort this sub is. 
---
One bracer shuffle of 4k cloth and about 2-3 hours of skinning nets me near 80k profit per week just from sinister gear and that's not the only thing I do.
---
I think opening day there were like 8 to choose from. 
---
Chinese gold farmers would also say brizz rike instead of only rava runs
---
I put 1 point in each talent on the first row, in each spec.. then I put a second one in each. Until I found a guide on the Internet.
---
Creators' understanding or don't are not important nowdays. If moneyholder's representative will show up with the request sharding will be there. Believe me.
---
This is the chronological reading/game order for warcraft books/games leading up to wow ( I'm not including books that came out after Vanilla even though they take place before Vanilla)

I genuinely had an amazing time through Wrath, start to end. 
---
Maybe I'm slow but I just herb but only earn like 5k and hour or something pitiful like that. TBH I just buy and sell coins. Blizz knows dummies/lazy people like me are such cash cows that way :(
---
Amen! 
---
I still listen to the music from Wrath and BC pretty much every day.
---
This would probably be a viable solution, but would require a lot more back end work than they probably want to put into this already niche product. There are definitely better solutions than sharding, but its hard to justify putting in the work for something like that when the alternative is a week of temporary sharding. 
---
Not seeing how this is different than just opening 5x as many servers and merging them together as populations die down.
---
They clearly don't want to merge, for whatever reason that is. 
---
It's completely different, you just dont get it.
---
Roll druid, if you don't like healing you can always go feral and min max the shit out of it (powershifting and mcp farming) to still do good dps.
---
thanks for adding your whiny useless contribution to the discussion. 
---
the fk is wrong with you
---
Okay, no. I'll grant you the arbitrary win of saying "No, it wasn't *in* the game". That doesn't change that the process to reverse loot designation existed. Blizzard is left with a choice to keep an entirely redundant process of GM tickets or come up with something new to save resources. That's why my compromise makes sense. It caters to both sides of the argument.
---
Honestly, it takes a little bit of time to learn your market but if you look up some gold making guides on YouTube (ignore all the ones that suggest transmog) and check out the r/woweconomy sub and get TSM its can be fairly easy.
---
I mean I just told you I didn't get it. Care to explain the differences? 
---
Wrath was the beginning of the end. 
---
For me, the game was over on you defeated Arthas.
---
And what an end it was too.
---
I can’t remember exactly, but he called OP (and anyone asking for changes, even tho OP wrote “99,8% humor”) SJWs and BC/LK-kids. I answered, he replied with “Found the SJW”z

A later revised version of the same post.
---
Notable changes:
---
* Cancel stacks when changing continents [kind of just an expansion of entering/leaving an instance] 
---
* Cancel stacks when changing weapons
---
* Cancel stacks when losing "control of your character (Fear, Scattershot, Blind, Polymorph, Mind Control, etc.)" [I take this as anything that moves your character involuntarily]
---
* Repentance not mentioned to cancel [likely because you couldn't spec into both at that point]
---
I disagree, it was professional pr work 
---
Yeah I'll look into that thanks. I'm not a big fan of stuff like AH flipping, selling your dailies to people, or basically having to interact with people for profit at all....
---
Something I can braindead grind, put on AH and forget.... I can do that. However I heard you need a good farming toon to do that viably.
---
6 slots for seals? You mean wisdom and light? 
---
Today there are many more as well; shadow weaving, improved shadowbolt, Nightfall, Faerie Fire, Annihilator, curse of recklessness, gift of arthas etc. As a warlock you'll have a hard time getting a corruption up on the main target.
---
It's completely different, I edited the post to hopefully explain it better.
---
cringe
---
Yeah from your perspective, but lets say another player have seen it, for him it would be admin abuse. And now imagine if every gm was doing what he was doing...
---
Yeah but most farming won't net you enough unless you're ready to dedicate a lot of time to it.  It's right for some people but to me it can get really tedious.  I wasn't a fan of flipping either until I discovered TSM 4 which just makes it rediculously easy, also I stick to flipping mats and/or crafting for the most part and it usually profits well.
---
You seem like a fun person
---
Thanks for all answers. I think I will not take enchanting but definitely tailoring plus a gathering profession. Most likely skinning because you need some leather for tailoring and it is easier for leveling. Second option would be herbalism to farm for potions at level 60 but then I might as well drop skinning for it.
---
I don't really look at it like "off-tank" being a role. This is of course a bit of a tryhard perspective, but a smart guild will put the better geared main tank on dps in fights where threat or mitigation is less of an issue and your gear is enough (assuming that main tank will have better dps gear than you because they play more).
---
Unlike dps, which strives to be as high as possible, tanking only needs to reach a certain level. You only need to hold aggro. Holding aggro with a huge margin is irrelevant most of the time. Same with survivability/mitigation. If the healers aren't doing anything and mana isn't an issue, you might wanna swap out some tanking pieces for dps gear to speed up the kill.
---
Basically you are not an off-tank, just a lesser geared tank. And all tanks should be concerned with optimizing dps both in tank gear and have a set for damage dealing. If you don't enjoy carrying around bags full of various armors, weapons and accessories you will be a sub-optimal warrior in PvE. In that case I would suggest a role that is more single-minded like a pure dps class.
---
What is sharding. It's multiple instances of the same Realm. I propose allowing people to select which instance they join from the Realm list, rather than having the game move people around on its own while they pla. This way there is no immersion lost from things appearing/disappearing as the game moves you from one shard to the next.
---
I don't think the sub is anti-effort. I love the mix-max stuff and am super keen to do that in Classic. I just don't care to comment to this effect every time I see some ret pally that wants to MT.
---
Op can just start the threads he wants, ignore the irrelevant posts and continue with the discussion.
---
I didn’t know I had a ranged auto attack with my wand on my mage, until around level 40. So every time I ran out of mana during a fight I had to just run away. 
---
The difference in gear was a great move. No more one-shotting. 
---
Its an interesting idea and it does alleviate some of the hassle of sharding, but not all of it (you're still being put into a separate community each time you swap servers.) I think it would be a lot of work to implement for something that would only be used for maybe 2 weeks. It needs to have name/guild reservation across all shards, would probably need cross shard chat/auction house functionality, and syncing your character across all the shards without allowing for duplication. 
---
How Blizzard's words can be a proof of that? They always lie and change their mind, and they have this fucking tech at retail servers. They haven't removed it from retail servers, why do you assume they understand that it's bad?   
---
They 'understand' that only when we actually are freaking out about it. So maybe we actually should freak out, until we see a result at LIVE servers. Classic will go live only because we've freaked out badly.
---
Yeah, it's very fun when people come to you to complain about your staff.
---
That's bollocks you don't need a $700 gpu to run VR games, my brother is coming home in a few days and im gonna ask to borrow his VR and if i can set it up in third person properly i'll let you know how it was, i'll stock up on ginger incase your claims of motion sickness are true but i'm used to spinning in my chair everyday so shouldn't be too bad.
---
Perhaps you should delay your decision until you know how large server populations are going to be. If servers will average 1500-2500 concurrent users in prime time then only the most active servers have any chance of late night raiding. If servers will average 3500-5000 concurrent then I'd expect that you could find busy US servers that have a few late night raiding guilds.  
---
When I started playing WoW, I leveled like 5 or 6 levels being a melee druid (dying so many times because of this), as at the time it was the first MMO I played but also played lots of D&amp;D, so I assumed there was a number of maximum spells I could cast a day, and only used them "in emergencies". I was pretty bad at english at the time, as it wasn't my first language, so I couldn't actually read what my abilities did until I tried them. I only played shooters at the time so I didn't even know what a mana bar was or meant...
---
Its gonna get fun when Classic hits. 
---
People talk shit about Wotlk for ”easy content, welfare heroics”, but honestly what do you expect from Classic?
---
Almost everything up to AQ is pure dps fights and if you use the world buffs its silly. DM has gear that is on the same level as MC, MC is pugable with half a brain, ZG is handouts just like ToGC.
---
Vanilla was ”hard” because most people didnt know shit.
---
Who would have a stick so far up their arse that they would complain about this?
---
I think just a tiny bit of overthinking is happening. It would work as easily as normal sharding. One shard fills up, either by total pop, or on a zone by zone basis, becomes locked full, and more shards open.
---
I dont see how can we see from this story that there was "no doubt"
---
We did lava runs all the time =)
---
The hate against Tips is irrational. Yes, he is info-lite. But there is always not only room but there is always a need for more info-lite content.
---
His concerns and advocacies are well thought out and genuine, even if you don't agree with all of them.
---
All this hate circle jerking against him is frankly out of taste.
---
Really? "Esfand is losing a lot of viewership because of Tips"?
---
What are you basing this claim off of?
---
Nobody except some private server players are freaking out...they aren't actually freaking out, they are acting.
---
Each and every single update of Classic is another nail on the coffin of private servers. There are hardcore private server players that are trying to create an image that Classic will fail and private servers will be better.
---
Why are they acting like that?
---
Because they are childish. "My toy is better than yours", even if they KNOW their toy is not even close to be as good as Blizzard's toy.
---
They know that Classic is going to be a hit, and private servers will basically be dead. And that means that they "toy" is dead.
---
They don't like that.
---
That's because Tbc and vanilla was a success. It's easy... 
---
Yeah, me too. Technologically speaking, that would be a milestone for the humanity.
---
This is no longer the case. I tried wc3 a while ago and it was like you said, almost only bot hosted games and the same few maps. Blizz has since banned bots and there are now lots of different maps hosted only by players :)
---
I would not waste my time with disinformation, because all we can talk about now comes from private servers, and their data is dog shit.
---
I guess teleporting him wouldn't make anyone notice, but cmon spawning critters and other stuff. Thats just breaking immersion. If I wanted for admins to have fun, I'd be playing on *fun* private servers. And if you've ever been on them, they're not fun for a long time, it's cheap fun that gets boring fast.
---
I mean I wouldn't complain about it, but let's be real, imagine I make a video of that event and post it on youtube in a neutral way. You believe gm responsible wouldn't be sanctioned?
---

I didn't make this, just thought it was worth posting. [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ip7TXfBSwQ)

I think the same, pretty sure that my LvL 19 Rogue was not able to queue for AB.
---
What? No, the advise is always check your credit card transactions. The issue is when people dont treat their credit cards like they would a bank account/debit card.
---
I was level 41 in Tanaris before i discovered talents. i was a warrior.
---
Gonna watch the whole series while I stream my 1-60 marathon on YouTube at launch 
---
The problem is that reddit isn’t for neutral discussion. Downvotes and upvotes turn this place into an echo chamber. Unpopular posts don’t get noticed and the popular posts are from those who skew their posting style and pander to the perceived views of the majority. 
---
The ironic thing is that It’s the min-max theorycrafting approach that will make ret paladins able to become useful to the point of justifying a spot in an average raid. (For an example of this see how feral druids became fun and semi-competitive because of crowd pummelers and theorycrafting with unexpected and creative playstyles popularized by Shedo). 
---
What classes shine at this bracket? 
---
This was literally a tradition in my guild. I was under the impression that they could come back to life if you didn't continue to kill them, even when all 5 were down.
---
The most important requirement for a raider, in any role, is reliable attendance. Find a guild whose raiding schedule works with your own schedule. Before AQ comes out, one raid a week for less than three hours will get you through current content. A few more hours a week is enough to farm your necessary consumables. 
---
Agree and agree
---
Poor Bear ;_;
---
Exactly, twinkers dont twink to play on equal footing with other players. 
---
I'd prefer more servers and higher population cap 5k-6k Max but more then 3k then sharding in any way of form.
---
\*sweating in warrior\*
---
There's always druids. They can both offheal and offtank, while also being dps =) (innervate gets you into raids)
---
I remember dying in Ragefire Chasm because it was my first time there and I wanted to see if the lava would do damage in a noob dungeon...
---
They'll probably add more servers if necessary. 
---
The realm cap in vanilla was roughly 2500 concurrent players, it was a design decision and every aspect of the outside world was designed around that number.
---
What I think they'll do is use sharding in order to create servers within servers for a period of time so that a server instead can hold 5k, 10k or whatever number they deem fit. After the tourists leave they can then turn off the sharding and be left with healthy populated servers with the authentic #nochanges cap in place.
---
You sound alot like "my dad is better then your dad" XD
---
Private servers will always exist, it's free and what ever you think about them. In recent years they become very good. Maybe not perfect like the original vanilla but I'd say god dam close to the vanilla spirit. I doubt that even classic will be an exact replica of vanilla in terms of values. And sharding is certainly not in the spirit of vanilla.
---
Troll is definitely better if you're talking exclusively PvE.
---
Even including PvP troll is roughly equal to undead (pros and cons depending on the specifics of the scenario). 
---
Yes there was and will be warriors brought as DPS that will be used to tank on trash.  Back in the day, I remember a lot of arms warriors filling this role, but I suspect in a competitive guild that role will be exclusively fury.  
---
This notion that your MT will by fury is based on purely private server experience and will be meaningful to &lt;1% of guilds come classic.  Even then it is only viable with stacked world buffs and speed running, not something that will be used for progression.  
---
Bm hunters don’t raid in vanilla. 
---
It will be really funny to talk with players that are planning to roll a spec based on private servers.
---
Especially the ones that you are mentioning : SP, Ret Pala, Ele Shammy, and most importantly, Druid tanks.
---
Those specs will be in VERY LOW DEMAND in Classic.
---
The HIGH DEMAND specs will be : Prot Warriors, Fury Warriors, Mages (Frost and later Fire), Combat Rogues, Holy Priest/Pala, Resto Shaman.
---
Medium demand : everything else.
---
Pretty much. Blizzard already stated that they understand that sharding is bad and are only using it as a tool to handle the massive influx of players. It's for our own good so we don't end up with dead servers after the novelty wears off.
---
&gt;Death Knights broke the entire balance of WoW for half a decade  
---
lol
---
&gt;Ulduar 
---
Is widely considered the best raid of all WoW, I think you're just having an opinion
---
Top guilds will clear all content within 24 hours kf release (apart from Rag obvs). The changes you are talking about are pretty minor. 
---
I think this is more or less the sharding system in place in SWTOR and GW2, isn't it?  
---
The main difference is that in those two you are prompted by the game, when your shard's population is getting low, to switch to a different one; you can do it manually in SWTOR, but only if shards have been created for your map.
---
Yes, except the new content plan makes your DM gear point moot, and ZG is going to be delayed also.
---
The only thing I can say is, "describe a twink and how can blizzard tell the difference from a twink and player that levels entirely in dungeons and BG's"
---
Simply put you cannot box people into pvp grinders/twinks/casuals.  There are already mechanics in game that reduce the impact of twinking, such as high end enchants only going on items over lvl 35 (I think).  
---
A similar argument would be at level cap splitting people with raid gear or r10+ items from the rest of the people queued, that sounds ridiculous right?  A bigger problem is people AFK farming honor and win trading.
---
I have never really twinked, I have rarely done the pvp grind, but even I dont see twinking as a problem.  In fact it actually assists in the economy of a realm, all those twink blues that people pay insane prices, all those mid level enchants and consumables that would otherwise never be sold.
---
MMORPG's are about various types of player all interacting in the same world.  Why deny some people what they like to do? or more to the point why would Blizzard remove something that DID exist and that MANY players enjoyed?
---
To be honest Cataclysm was really fun until they introduced LFR and the monstrosity of a raid instance called Dragon Soul
---
"Lets ignore this stable technology that we have working for years now, and replace it with new tech that we have to develop, that does basically the same thing, just to *maybe* improve some users experience in the first couple of hours of their play time."
---
What could go wrong, eh?
---
Ye Mr Capitalist Henry will go down to Blizz HQ just to tell em, he wants sharding in classic OR ELSE!
---
I know a guy who made thousands of gold on a pserver with trade window scamming
---
he was super super quick
---
But ... you gave your Money to your new char, please say so ;D
---
Orgrimmar and Stormwind are both in Elwynn Forest and Durotar respectively, both starting zones.
---
Where will the sharding begin, and where will it end? Will the capital cities of Orgrimmar and Stormwind be shared too? Or will we see people phasing in and out right in front of Orgrimmar?
---
If the capital cities are sharded, or even right outside them, this will be an extremely ugly thing for Classic and there is absolutely no excuse for it other than "we don't want to pay for the infrastructure to handle that many players in a single place."
---
Their weak reasoning for starter zone sharding is that the large crowds will make questing and mob tagging more difficult, which arguably isn't a valid reason either since that's a natural difficulty arising from the launch of a new server and is actually true to Vanilla, but whatever. At least some people think that is excusable.
---
But sharding in the capital cities? Inexcusable.
---
&gt; Farming tactical/logistic/combat badges for the good stuff that comes from turning in a bunch of them like Earthstrike, Might of Cenarius and Rockfury Bracers (+280 AP for 20s trinket, +4 wep/1% hit ring, +27 SP/1% spellhit cloth bracers).
---
Not available until 1.9 I believe and then you have to wait for AQ gates to be opened
---
If we can't trust what Blizzard says anymore, wtf are you doing here? Classic is just a promise until it launches, they might have lied about it, and its just to hype up wow on mobile...
---
16th July
---
31/5/15 was probably the most common build for OTs through most(if not all) of vanilla.  Fury was dog crap most of vanilla in large part to threat issues(basically no reason to use one rather than a rogue).  Threat issues by 1.12 were significantly reduced making fury warriors more viable as they were less likely to faceplant after ripping aggro.
---
I used to run a bg here and there when I leveled in vanilla, but no more. Twinking has changed the vanilla experience to the point that nochanges means changes. 
---
Cataclysm was great too, the end of it wasn't cause it lasted so long. But everything added was fun and classes where balanced good. After that it went downhill.
---
Realize offspeccing is quite expensive, and most people end up pvping and pveing in the same spec.  
---
Shadow is not great in BGs, but it is only slighly worse then mage or warlock.  Adding a defensive dispel on horde is a lot of utility.  I think they do lose some value as horde since enemy teams will surely have multiple magic dispels available. 
---
There are also some shadow/disc hybrid builds where you mostly heal, but pick up fear CD redux, shadow hit, and silence to help add control and you are a bit more able to add some damage to finish people off.  In this playstyle Troll works better then UD, as you can add in Hex of weakness to further disrupt enemy healers.  
---
The 30/0/21 shaman spec is probably not really raid viable and also not really a main healer in a BG.  In PvE, those last points represent improved mana spring, mana tide, and 10% healing.  Shaman is often in demand class, but my mostly casual raiding guild back in the day would not have accepted a non-mana tide shaman.  In pvp losing that +10% is quiet noticeable, and you have to kinda choose what to gear.  If you go full damage, you won't have enough +healing to make the healing really worthwhile other then as a spot heal.  If you run heavy +healing your elemental burst goes from scary to a wet noddle.  
---
Typically that means the 30/0/21 geared as if they were a mage, with better armor, less mobility, no CC, but offset that with group utility and some offheals.
---
Anyone who thinks sharding is bad in the first 2 zones hahaahahhaa
---
I have those three aswell, but the fact is that WotLK was the downfall.
---
But that doesnt mean I didnt love WotLK that was the middle point imo and had they just kept the casualisation there, we would still see WoW on top imo.
---
Just a shame that early cata heroics were nerfed and that patch 4.2 nerfed all previous tier and basically just confirmed that progress this tier doesnt matter as you can just do the content a little later easier. 
---
Totalbiscuit did a good video on this back in the day when he actually unsubbed from WoW.
---
Hopefully we will see the original trilogy as I love the original trilogy, but more content for Classic WoW on seperate realms would also be super cool
---
I'll speak from the experience I had on pservers, so take this with a grain of salt.
---
On my guild there was a social member who was raid leading a wreekly pug. He had a lot of experience in vanilla raids, strategies, loot distribution and leading.
---
He had a core of 3-5 people who would help run the pug and split the profits (they reserved auctionables), they advertised their pug for the whole week and had a discord channel to sign up. Players were expected to have preraid gear and bring some fire protection potions.
---
Well that pug did MC in less than 1.5 hours before BWL came out. It was so smooth it eventually got regular dedicated tryhard players who would join every week.
---
When BWL came out they cleared it all the first day. They beat several guilds on that server.
---
Later on he stopped pugging, and started leading our guild raids. The day he started raiding with us, we went from clearing MC+6/8BWL in 2 days, to clearing everything in a day. 
---
Indeed, I can see private servers being as if not more popular after classic launches. The proper vanilla data will be available, so creating a more authentic experience will be far easier. At the end of the day, some people want to play for free and some enjoy the xp multiplier in order to play end game easier. This isn't going to change. I'm not advocating private servers, but I don't think everyone will sign up for Blizzards version on Vanilla.
---
Then very closely afterwards they just put up all the servers they had. They originally had a very specific rollout intended, but they didn't expect so many players so quickly and had to just turn everything on. 
---
Petition to ban the word cringe from Classic
---
Great soundtrack!!
---
July 16th
---
Not classic, but TBC ...
---
Played nightelf hunter, like 64 or something in terokkar. Did the quest at the camp in North east with the wolves. Saw as reward you get a sick helmet with AP, stam and Agi that Looked like a fucking wolf head. 13 yo me like "HELL MAN THAT LOOKS GORGEOUS!!!"
---
As the helm was available at all armor classes (Cloth, leather, mail and plate) with different stats, the leather and mail one had the same stats. Just looking at the stats, I took the leather helmet. As a hunter. I learned mail armor at 40, so I have to use mail.
---
After realizing, what I just have done, taking the LEATHER HELMET, completly wasting the quest reward like that, I went full pissed mode, sold the leather helmet, logged off and go to my room being mad as fuck.
---
Later when my dad - also hunter, 70 already in raid guild - came home and asked me what happened, I explained to him what happened.
---
He was like "why didnt you just use the leather helmet? You dont Need armor anyways as hunter because you dont take physical damage, dont you?"
---
That Moment I decided to make a warrior and discovered melee for me.
---
6 months before TBC patch got released we pugged MC all the time clearing everything, without issues. Also, we had addons that guides people through every fight and it was a requirement to have them installed.
---
Downranking healing isn't particularly hard.  Also I think Blizzard is stating that addons that "play the game for you" are going to be broken/discouraged so decursive(?)/auto-downrank addons are unlikely to be used.  Honestly if your friend is a paladin and you will be leveling/pvp'ing at all together warlock and warrior seem like better choices.  Another con for warlock is that you are just spamming shadowbolt in raids for the most part so it could be rather boring.  Warriors seems like a good choice if you have the time/mentality for it and if you level with a paladin friend it wont be slow.  However, keep in mind MT positions are not always available so to get that designated MT/secondary tank role you may need to network pre-release or early after release.
---
30. August. Legion was also announced to be released in summer. I guess they will do the same to make the vanilla start as smoth as possible. More time means more chances to fix errors. That's what my brain is telling me. My heart hopes for July.
---
You think that you stopped ~~playing~~ paying, but you didn’t...
---
This kind of thinking is definitely evident in music. People think the music from their teenage years was the 'golden age'.
---
But with WoW I think there is a pretty big consensus that the golden age was roughly from release - end of WOTLK.
---
124 days, 2968 hours. 
---
10.682.182 seconds
---
If its july 16th
---
can confirm, priest at 19 with correct gear and big health and mana pool was so much fun
---
With all the hype for classic I couldn't stop myself from hopping on a private server and doing some mild leveling (I keep telling myself it's to figure out what class I'm going to play)
---
Fairly low chance that not even 1/50 people take enchanting, especially when you add in alts. Reality is guild only needs 1 active enchanter.
---
Keep in mind that priests both in PvE and PvP have very different roles/playstyles depending on whether you are horde or alliance.  Horde priest = tank healer, primary dispeller, main defensive healer/preferred warrior healbot in PvP.  Alliance priest = raid healer, backup dispeller, main offensive healer(mainly due to offensive dispel) in PvP.  Druid is more similar playstyle on both alliance/horde but keep in mind if you play alliance shamans will be a nightmare as they can purge both of your HoTs and NS.
---
I'm a pserver player and I want Classic to be successful because I like WoW 1.12. I think some people are freaking out simply because they don't like/trust current Activision/Blizzard.
---
And pservers won't be dead anytime soon. Not everybody's going to play subscription fee and a significant part of pserver playerbase plays WotLK or 1.12 high-rate servers and funservers.
---
The margin between rok and bloodseeker is small but rok is better. You also have to keep in mind that hit is easier to come by when you start raiding. The hitscope,gear of your teir has hit on it and also rings/necks have hit on them, zg enchants have hit. All in all, when planning to start pve as hunter u usually have xbow or a gun over a bow because the bows have to fast attack speed. The fact that a lvl 51 xbow is slightly better then rok already says enough. Once you get bwl xbow you set. Min maxing, troll is better, although a good case can be made with the +5 dps on pets for orcs... I think it depends on the fight and how well you know it. 
---
You don't need a new PC for Classic :)
---
Hunter can basically have their optimal PvE and PvP spec be the same.  Elemental shaman and locks have different specs depending on raiding vs PvP.
---
Thanks, Freud.
---
This is literally what sharding does, except you don't need to merge servers. I don't get why people are so against sharding but want this instead. Its the same thing except it ends after the starter zones not when the devs merge servers. 
---
Warriors get somewhat pigeon-holed by needing a healbot in BGs though.  If queueing with guild/friends that is fine but if you solo queue you need to have fantastic gear to make some random decide to healbot you for the BG.  Without a healbot being a warrior in BGs is somehow almost worse than world PvP as you just get CC'ed and/or focused.
---
 I know I had INSANE PvP gear on my rogue. I had 5k health, 33% crit etcetc. Like, really insane PvP gear. I was almost unkillable with 5k health.
---
Fighting a Warlock with 30k health, that'd be a raid boss lol :D
---
Nope
---
Speaking of golden ages... :)  
---
End of Vanilla when TBC talents kicked in before TBC release. Playing Ret Paladin at that time and jumping into PVP with an OP crusader strike! 
---
Yes, the 60 warlock and paladin mount are unavailable before 1.4
---
End of August most likely
---
For PVP:
---
Priest:
---
Pros:Supreme healing output, is always vital in pvp due to dispel
---
Cons:You are going to eat shit in pvp.  Every team will likely train you.  You have pretty shit tankiness, and super shit mobility.  Despite being the "ultimate support/healer" you are the single most reliant on friendly offhealing and peeling to not just explode every group fight.   I would only play priest in pvp with a good group.  
---
Druid: 
---
Pros:  Mobility is kinda hard to overate on a healer.  You can almost always pick superior engagements, and rotate and reinforce faster then any other support.  Excels when a full time healer isn't needed like in small 2-3 man fights.  
---
Cons:  You straight up do not have a full healing toolkit.  No aoe heal, healing touch is too slow to use, regrowth is an inferior spell when spammed, and rejuv isn't enough as your only true hot.  You better like playing the heal and run or hybrid playstyle because you cannot adequately fulfill the role of main healer in pvp.  
---
Just to your wand point, the skinning will afford you the first 2 wands pretty easily, then finance you up to and beyond 60. It's pretty clear cut in favor of skinning if thats your concern.
---
&gt; The only thing I can say is, "describe a twink and how can blizzard tell the difference from a twink and player that levels entirely in dungeons and BG's"
---
I don't think anyone has a huge problem with twink-like levellers who level entirely in dungeons and BGs. It's the twinks who don't level that are problematic.
---
&gt; Simply put you cannot box people into pvp grinders/twinks/casuals. 
---
I think you are kicking up dust then complaining that it is hard to see. Giving some modest xp rewards from battlegrounds, allowing xp-locking and quarantining the locked toons solves the problem and we can leave it up to the philosophers how it affects grinders, twinks and casuals.
---
&gt; A similar argument would be at level cap splitting people with raid gear or r10+ items from the rest of the people queued, that sounds ridiculous right?
---
Not in the least. Every sport has some kind of divisions for exactly this reason, to prevent really boring mismatches. I'm not currently convinced that this is necessary and it seems like it would cause problems when people were first getting r10+ gear but it is very far from ridiculous.
---
&gt; In fact it actually assists in the economy of a realm, all those twink blues that people pay insane prices, all those mid level enchants and consumables that would otherwise never be sold.
---
The economy without twinks would be different but in no way worse. It's neither good nor bad if level 19 blues sell for ten times the value of level 13 or level 23 blues.
---
&gt; MMORPG's are about various types of player all interacting in the same world. Why deny some people what they like to do?
---
The simplest way to explain it to you is to tell you that the experience of every player matters, and what some people like to do is to spoil the game for other people. So denying those people what they want to do (linger forever at level 19 griefing people) actually enables other, less sadistic or sociopathic players to do what they want to do (have fun in reasonably fair PvP battlegrounds).
---
So we should probably be also asking for those long queues to log into full severs? Cos mmmm, nothing like that Vanilla inconvenience right?
---
Nope, The dreadsteed of Xoroth was introduced with Dire Maul.
---
Does that still exist?
---
&gt; You aren't killing Rag in blues and greens.
---
The guild Undergeared cleared a lot of Wrath content in blues. Why would it be impossible to do the same in vanilla?
---
There is a custom map called, The Black Road, its literally a MMO in WC3 with bosses and all.
---
Anymore? You never trust company like Activision Blizzard. It's historically proved without any exceptions. 
---
Is waiting in line so intolerable to you that you'd have the game be sharded and the experience and integrity of the game fundamentally altered? 
---
Not everyone needs to log in at hour zero.
---
I've said this a million times before, but I just don't think that a players first impression of vanilla should be a sharded Elwynn forest or whatever. The reason i fell in love with Vanilla to begin with was all the people there. The chaos on private servers, while annoying at some points, was just a breath of fresh air from playing retail wow for so long.
---
The whole reason why vanilla wow is so good is the social aspect. When you shard level 1-10 what is really the difference between vanilla wow and retail wow? Nothing. New players aren't gonna stick around for that.
---
There are ways that Blizzard can mitigate the issue without sharding. I think having sharding be there at the 15 year re-release of vanilla is just disrespectful. I cannnot wait for the launch. But i'm gonna be so said if i log in and Elwynn forest is sharded.
---
It wasn’t actually. It was introduced in 1.4, the patch after Dire Maul. In Classic they will both arrive simultaneously, however :)
---
It would be an extreme dick move if we needed the latest expansion beside the sub just to play Classic... I hope Activision won't get any ideas from here...
---
The titles asks if it will be available and the question if it will be unavailable. So I guess the answer is:
---
No. 
---
Yes. 
---
The Barrens music
---
Everyone has an opinion about everything, even if they have no prior knowledge or experience.
---
I stand corrected then.
---
Tarren Mill vs Southshore, never forget!
---
Let's hope its end of August. I have lots of stuff going on in July. I would hate to cancel it all. Oh wait, I wouldn't !
---
OH MY DAYS! Let me drive this hype train! I'm annoying pretty much all my family, friends and work colleagues. My holiday time is prepped and ready to be booked when the launch date is announced. I've put together a Google Doc of my plans characters/name claims, levelling routes, gear to get, step by step guides to levelling professions, key quests that I need to get before dungeons, even quests to get that give good gear/bags. I've had so much fun creating it :D 
---
IT IS SO SOON
---
I SMELL IT
---
LUCOZADE ON TAP.
---
Cairne wasn't too bad since Horde had travel time to get there as most people didn't stay in Thunderbluff and then his tent has a rather easy chokepoint at the entrance which you can have your mages/warlocks lock down.
---
They were just 4 weeks apart though :)
---
I am just stating the many reasons why Blizzard would have no reason to add in some custom queue system.  I have literally no opinion either way as I will not be doing the pvp grind.  I will be playing games of AB or WSG against people with potentially HW gear and I will be limited to what I can get from PVE, does that mean I should be segregated into a carebear/casual group of players?
---
Would be more sensible request to remove group queues to prevent pre-made groups stomping everyone, twink gear is available to EVERY player, but not everyone has a group of 10+ friends that they spam BG's with all day every day....
---
There is literally no way to do what the OP suggests, an automated system cannot decipher the difference between a twink and "normal" player.  The bigger issue in low level BG's is premade groups, they do more damage to the casual experience thank the odd player with twink gear, although in a pre-made its normally at least half that group twinked as a minimum.  
---
Removing the ability to queue as a group will then cause more issues as randoms can end up in a WSG with no healer at all or no cleanser, this is why pre-mades started to be a thing.  The whole BG queue system would have to be reworked and that in itself is more work, and things that were not in vanilla.
---
I am not for or against changes to the queue system, because the pvp ranking system is so broken in vanilla I refuse to jump on that train.  It rewards time investment not skill, and as such people twinking are investing time so why should they not get the same advantage a lvl 60 does that invests time raiding to AQ40/Naxx to get gear and stomp fresh 60's.  
---
It seems many people assume the old servers will return but it seems likely they will do things differently this time around. 
---
Not that it wouldn’t be cool to log onto Balnazzar once more 😌
---
Obviously made up or twisted at least. Mobs are mostly red for you at 38 in tanaris and there is no way you could level a ret paladin to 38 without talents. 
---
When you are raiding AQ40 as a priest and just dont tell anyone that you didnt switch back from your PvP-heal spec to your normal PvE heal spec for the week ... just casual vanilla things.
---
Technology we have working for years.. =! Technology that provides value for the players
---
Look at the sub numbers, WoWs numers kept rising fast during Vanilla and TBC. During Wrath its almost a flat line. Meaning that during Wrath the influx of new players was barely enough to compensate for the players quitting the game. 
---
I think you misunderstood his proposal.
---
It was common knowledge among the healers in our guild that sitting down without drinking still increased mana regen, just not as much.  So the whole second line in MC would be sitting between heals
---
Maybe you shouldn’t speak for other people as who they are and what they want.
---
Any kind of drink in a can. I can't eat at the keyboard for whatever reason ... Well, maybe it's because I hate having to take both hands off the keyboard/mouse I'm that lazy.
---
IIRC Mgt normal dropped equal loot to regular heroics while Mgt hc dropped Karazhan equivalent stuff. 
---
There is difference between opinion and how things actually work like it or not.
---
&gt; Most guilds only ran two, maybe three locks. 
---
[Greetings from The Core](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12057/garr)
---
First raid in Mc. The other rogues explained evasion and vanish to me, since I never bought those skills. 
---
Yes I  lvled a rogue with daggers and with no evasion or vanish.
---
I'm traumatized by the leveling experience in classic. 
---
August 31 23:59. =(
---
you can not win wow.  
---
let that sink in.
---
playing however I feel is what is fun. beeing forced into something is not.  
---
do you think a motocyclist will enjoy a straight road more then a one with turns?  
---
after all, the straight road is the most efficient way.
---
It still bothers me that troll males squat all the time, while troll females stand straight and tall like a Roman column.
---
I loved having dual raid geared BM hunter in 2's.  It only worked up to around 1700ish but anyone that got caught without an escape melted in a few seconds.
---
to be an elitist asshole you must first be elite.

But what would be the benefit of transfers instead of copies? Vanilla servers are sure to take a huge hit if/when BC servers are released anyway - I'd wager they'll lose at least half of the population. What's the point of making this even more drastic by effectively burning the bridge behind you, and closing the door to those who might want to jump back in Vanilla once in a while and play with friends who stayed there?
---
Part of the experience of getting into an MMORPG at launch is the absolute chaos. I'm not at all advocating that we just let 5000 people onto each server which makes it impossible to play, but sharding just isn't and never has beeen, the right solution.
---
The idea of creating three servers with the same name, Sargeras-1, Sargeras-2, Sargeras-3 which will merge at some point, would be a much better solution. Split one servers population into three servers at launch and merge them after two weeks. Names are shared, so you can't get issues there, but you'll have much less players on each server to begin with.
---
I just can't fathom how ruining interactions with other players is considered a better option than just splitting a server into three and then merging them after the initial rush. It may be easier for Blizzard, which seems to be the only thing they consider these days.
---
1000 people fighting over mobs in Valley of Trials isn't great if you just want to quest, but it's hillarious and fun and will at most extend your starting quests 30 minutes.
---
This is the dumbest thing I've read on this subreddit. Ten bucks you didn't play Vanilla at all, but want to act superior to players who want a different experience than you.
---
Yeah, this is exactly what was going on.  it wasn't an event but just the devs having a lot of fun writing patch notes for a bandaid hotfix to something.  It was still cool of them to write it like that.
---
God dammit, that man can speak!
---
I don't know which country but I'm playing on Atlantis netherwing server it says its hosted in EU. 
---
I'm in Las Vegas and getting 170ms latency 
---
Or just releasing a server with 1k cap, and then upping the cap by 1k every 2 days until you get 3 or 4k or whatever.
---
I mean, it seems like people can't fathom just waiting a few more days or a week to play. Expecting to be able to log in and play on 00:00 at an MMO launch day is just absurd. I don't know if this is what people expect in 2019, but it shouldn't be.
---
And yea like you say, the chaos and all the people fighting for mobs is kinda fun. If you get mad over not being able to kill mobs on day 1, 2 or 3 then that's your problem.
---
Pretty sure Ret still sucked then. I remember it being a 10 s CD whereas MS was a 6s CD. I complained about that on the forums.
---
Noob
---
I think the disconnect in discussion is that some specs are seriously worse than others and you can go ahead and play those but you'll have to find a guild that has policies that revolve around fairness for sub par specs in some way. now hopefully this will happen but the issue with 40 man raiding is that the game is such a big time investment at that point that if you find out it's too much of a struggle inviting these guys you'll tend towards just siding with the numbers. ie, warrior gets the spot over the enhance shaman even as a casual guild.
---
we're all hoping you can invite whatever you like, and hopefully the fact that players sucked so bad back then means that some really.janky raid comps can still get the raid done but we just don't know and to expect these jank ass specs to get a fair raid spot based on the fact we haven't tried it is wishful thinking and your default position should be a struggle
---
Holy Nova is strong enough to do lasher farms, and as priest you have some freedom in how you spend talent points, so you can pick up the holy nova talent without much issue if you're holy spec.
---
A Vanilla tank in Naxx will absolutely have 11k hp. 
---
This is total bullshit, there have always been groups that carry. You didnt just ding 80 and hop straight into current tier raids. There was definitely a more noticeable power creep, but carrying insta dings has ALWAYS been a thing. Its stupid to say "well i worked for mine because i did it slow, he didnt \*bitch fit\*"
---
Not unbuffed 
---
July 16th is only a meme, but it might end up being true. That'd be great.
---
You'd think they would slot Classic in around then between the upcoming 8.2 and whatever they do with retail towards the back end of the year, so June/July makes sense. They're not gonna want the overlap. Also "a classic summer" strongly implies we'll be playing *during* summer, not that Classic will come out right at the end of it. 
---
I get why you're saying those specs will be high demand, but won't the supply of Warriors, Mages, and Rogues be very high, which would then make them low demand?  You know, from a simple supply &amp; demand theory.
---
Then again, this time around if countless more people know about that demand, then supply may match it....theoretically, but I don't know what'll really happen.
---
The true reality is that honest demand isn't a real thing in WoW, or even most video games for that matter, because you can clear with whatever you want as long as the roles are filled.  The true demand is really just either for people that think competitive PVE is a thing and that it's fun for some reason or those that want to give a bunch of leeway because they think their raid will be full of really bad players or something.
---
Shut the fuck up retard
---
Actually in WotLK I had a hunter called Pvpleveller who levelled almost entirely by doing battlegrounds starting at level ten. By nineteen they were a twink in all but name, with lots of blue PvP rewards and BoE blues, dungeon blues in most other slots and good enchants everywhere. I think I have a screenshot of them somewhere at level 19 with the +25 agility enchant.
---
It was fun, but it was also blatantly broken and unfun for everyone else. I figured it was okay because I only really offensive for a handful of battlegrounds before I levelled out of 10-19 and became the underdog again in 20-29. Circle of life and all that.
---
But I think the difference is that I can tell the difference between good fun and toxic fun at other people's expense. Something can be fun for me but also bad for me and bad for the game. When I was OP I wasn't getting better at the game, I wasn't being challenged, I was just bullying people who mostly couldn't fight back. I wasn't until I levelled into the 20 bracket that I started to get better at the game again.
---
I was also a match for most mid-twenties toons at twenty, which means in real terms I'd brought what was effectively a level 25(ish) toon to a 10-19 battleground. Yay me.
---
They don't have have to split the server into thousand of shards you know. 2 or 3 shards is enough to split the early population into something more managable and still get the vanilla experience.
---
I was a melee hunter from 1-18 until I found out how to train growl on my pet ;-)
---
+healing initially didn't add anything to spell damage, Benediction is one of few items that add to ALL holy spells (there is also cloth chest in maraudon off rare mob that gives +holy dmg). You need to +spell dmg or +healing and dmg items to improve it. If i remember in tbc/prepatch they changed it so +healing items added about 30-40% of bonus as +dmg as well as healing
---
On pservers 'defensive' stance mean they attack the mob that is attacking you, so if you shoot and the mob turns to you, your pet runs at the mob.
---
Anyone can play Ret by themselves, however a raid is a group effort, so you need to compromise. You can negotiate to play ret with people, but not everyone wants to deal with it. 
---
A more real world example is if you are working in construction, sure japanese joints are beautiful, but a lot of occasions make them impractical to getting the building finished. 
---
Fuck twinks I hate them so much. I will probably be crucified for this, but Blizzard giving twinks their own bracket would be a major change I actually support.
---
That's not the vanilla experience. How is sharding a server in any way a vanilla experience? The only reason people want it is because they've been spoiled and in 2019 people can't understand not getting everything they want day 1.
---
Waiting in a queue is a thousand times more of a vanilla experience.
---
&gt;  I will be playing games of AB or WSG against people with potentially HW gear and I will be limited to what I can get from PVE, does that mean I should be segregated into a carebear/casual group of players?
---
You seem to have trouble grasping the idea that I don't have any problem at all with divisions that prevent major mismantches. I do not think it is needed in this case, but I could be convinced. The goal should be good matches, and if gear disparities mean the matches are pointless then the game would be improved by splitting up the population into two or more divisions.
---
&gt; Would be more sensible request to remove group queues to prevent pre-made groups stomping everyone, 
---
I am not saying you are wrong but that is not what this thread is about. This thread is about Blizzard's policy on quarantining twinkers so they don't spoil the game for levellers.
---
&gt; There is literally no way to do what the OP suggests, an automated system cannot decipher the difference between a twink and "normal" player. 
---
Where have you been for the last ten years? You give them all a modest amount of xp for PvPing, and this boots the twinks out into a higher bracket and affects nothing else that matters. You don't need to "decipher the difference between a twink and "normal" player" at all and I don't see any purpose to that argument except to muddy the waters.
---
Temporarily seeing 1000 people in elwynn vs 5000 will be less disruptive than having 3 servers merged, 2000 players added, out of nowhere 
---
I now know the value of totally rushing new servers. On a pserver I play on (with nobody else in the zone), I pick up 5 crystals on a full round and about 100 thorium ore.
---
High effort
---
Would I be crazy to roll a prot warrior as a pretty casual player?
---
I honestly feel like things will be super different from OG vanilla. Back then it was like dungeons were some hidden shadow mystery that nobody even understood. I think it'll be nice to find groups easily, and I love to tank dungeons. I rolled prot in MOP for the first time and loved it- doing content was so easy, and I had so much control over my experience. 
---
I also feel like I might end up being able to PUG into some raids or fill within a guild without being a committal hardcore raider. \*\*Is this realistic to expect rolling a tank?\*\* 
---
The last time I played vanilla, I was 9, and I spent all my time dicking around as a mage in IF looking for people to give me something fun to do. I honestly really loved that playstyle in Vanilla, because every time you ended up doing something, it was worth doing. I feel like prot might be the absolute perfect way to continue the legacy, lol. The cute gnome tank who's down for whatever. 
---
Also, no matter what anybody says in this thread, I'll probably do it anyways, because there is absolutely nothing that beats a Gnome in plate armor. 
---
Nightfall/Conflag Lock is plenty flashy. 
---
Oh a post I can contribute to!
---
After reaching level 52 with my Warlock in 2005, I started to learn the auction house - and by learn, I mean actually use it for the first time. The first thing I did was to filter out common, uncommon and rare items, because obviously I'm going straight for the epic items and none of that other shit.
---
Holy fuck, whats this, an epic item I can actually use at my level? I had been saving some gold, and had to borrow around 20g from my friend to be able to purchase it. I fucking bought it eventually! It had cost me roughly 100g, and all my friends were literally shouting at me not to buy it after I told them what I'd get - fuck them, they're just a jealous bunch
---
I went around with a level 50 epic sword called the Bloodrazor as a Warlock. It has absolutelly ZERO stats, and it had a small chance to proc some bleeding damage on it.
---
I leveled up to 53 by meleeing mobs while my voidwalker was tanking. I didn't even use DoTs, just melee hits.
---
That one level took a while
---
&gt; Players were expected to have preraid gear and bring some fire protection potions.
---
This automatically excludes a huge amount of deadweight dipshits only looking to be carried for free epics. However if you had this requirement back in vanilla you wouldn't have found enough people. And if you lifted any requirements then you would just waste everyone's time because the raid was  90% deadweight.
---
ye, i loved those 6 man parties
---
There is no way all your armor matched that well.
---
You won't see 1000 people on the same shard though. IIRC it's around 100-200 at most. How will it be disruptive if these players are beyond starter zones? I don't get that argument...
---
I never understood why people deleted their characters.  WHY!?!?
---
I would have no issue with the changes to the PVP systems, in fact I am very much FOR changes to the pvp systems.  But to do that you would have to pretty much start from scratch and rebuild it.  Small changes like this will simply deny some people a playstyle they enjoy, which I dont think Blizzard will do considering its a change that is outside the scope of the vanilla era.
---
As far as I am concerned the pvp systems in wow are so broken it makes participation pointless unless you are going to push it to the limit.  With the current system you are either farmed, or farming others, and its player choice if they join that game in the hope of becoming a wolf instead of being a sheep.
---
I would like Blizzard to have looked at the entire ranking and rewards system, looked and the way BG queues are formed by insuring an even class spread between teams, and evaluate the need for DHK's and the rewards for the open world PVP objectives.
---
TLDR: PVP systems in WoW are broken from start to finish, as such I will not participate in that portion of the game.  IF I decide to roll on a pvp server I will be only open to world encounters, and I am happy with that.  I play this game for fun, and I will even solo queue a BG and get stomped on occasion, but thats because I am bad at PVP not because I am slightly outgeared.   A good player is always a good player, a bad player will always die.  The pvp system does not reward the good player UNLESS they spend hours playing for months on end which some people cannot do.  So in theory you can have BAD players with the BEST items just because of the mechanics.  I think too many people put down deaths in pvp to gear because they refuse to accept they were outplayed, or an ability was resisted or an add in open world attacks you not the other player.  Gear is a small portion of the end result of ANY pvp encounter.
---
Sorry for the rant, went a bit OT.
---
True, although I think mage/ele are better if thats what your trying to do. NF/CFlag is probably the biggest glass cannon spec there is, very few cooldowns, limited self healing, no movement options etc
---
I'm swinging between Lock or Druid. The big pro of healer in raids is that it is far more engaging, a lot of DPS is extremely boring in Classic. 
---
Looks &gt; Stats
---
That's because you ignore half the story. Then anything can seem "funny".
---
Yes, Wrath implemented things like LFD, but it was *also* the xpac that had one of the most popular raids, Ulduar - still hailed for it's clever implementation of heroic as a mechanic in the actual raid.
---
It is also an xpac that involved some amazing lore. The Lich King is, like Illidan, a stable of the lore that most people love. While Illidan hardly got screentime in TBC, Wrath showed that the devs could change and made sure you saw The Lich King.
---
Overall, Wrath was in many ways an amazing xpac. Also, above all else, people had *fun*. Honestly, back then I didn't quite feel the problem of things like LFD, it didn't affect me *that* much. I loved my class, I loved the content, the atmosphere of the north, the raids, PvP - it was simply enjoyable.
---
Any class can make gold as long as they are smart. Sometimes healers are hard to come by so you could offer your healing services in exchange for some gold. What you see on private servers alot are people doing dungeon runs and reserving things like orbs from strat live. I recommend leveling up a profession either. Alchemy or enchanting.  Priests are not great at aoe farming but im sure you could find a way to make it work. I say play whatever you feel like playing and the gold will come.
---
Just sit on your hands until phase 2?
---
Shard until you leave the very basic starting areas. For example Northshire or Valley of Trials. 
---
Oh man, imagine if they went with Nostalrius for one of their servers.
---
even with r14 weapons and gear, i've seen hpals that achieve such rank and getting weapon and set and rerolling ret for fun. i can tell you its super bad even in that gear. 
---
they decent against couple of classes, like rogues or warriors, but overall and in bg enviroment they are super underwhelming.
---
against noobs, and clueless ppl its fun though not gonna lie.
---
reck is only good against noobs and low hp undergeared ppl, as ppl get gear and know how to handle paladins they simply don't do enough damage to nuke someone down with reck, and then what? you autottack for 300 once every 3 seconds even with top weapons? (when ppl get 5khp+). you don't have any consistent damage, or interrupts, cucked by any healing. 
---
ret paladin is  a melee class without slows or interrupts, yikes.
---
spam purge on you, and /lol. or spam healing and rotate at place. mind you 4 out of 9 classes got healing capabilities.
---
i guess they are ok in duels cos of their hard survivability long cd, like bubble and loh and bop.  but overall in pvp especially at bgs they are super underwhelming.
---
at least form a shaman perspective.
---
warlock if not bubble, you gonna get spam feared to death. and won't be able to nuke in hoj any half geared warlock with a proper build. 
---
hunters/mages kited out of the range of all of your abilities. again any hope is bubble.
---
heal class will just heal, cos you don't have interrupts. and once they have gear you won't be able to oneshot them. in most cases.
---
as i said before ya ret is good against warriors and rogues, cos its melee classes without self healing, but with some support and healing they'll rape you aswell. and as other guy said they learn to avoid you.
---
p.s. enh shaman is much better.
---
p.s.s. no idea where you able to test hem and in what enviroment and against what opponents. from everything ive seen playing on ps ret is one of the worst classes you can play. 
---
Ah there's the barrens representative
---
&gt; But considering everyones access to detailed breakdowns of the fights, and how mechanically skilled players are these days im guessing it could be totally doable to put together a group of randoms and do most of the content 
---
Wrong.
---
Regardless of the player skill (which is today as it was 15 years ago) , and the access to fight details...Classic is NOT Retail. 
---
To access most of the raid content, you will have to be part of a guild.
---
The only PuG raid content will be MC, Ony, ZG and AQ20.
---
BWL, AQ40 and Naxx won't.
---
Isn't this picture from Kargoz's leveling guide?
---
you don't even need the latest expansion to play current wow, no chance they'd do it
---
You know that your 1 2 3 are basically shards, but worse? 
---
Why do you need 3 servers? You can just cap the server at 1k the first day, 2k on the 3rd day, 3k on the fifth day, and so on. No merging needed.
---
You can farm pretty much anything, it just goes a bit slower. I used to farm the water eles in EPL by the lakes
---
Then maybe you should unsubscribe from this thread.... Coz we are hyped.
---
&gt; I would have no issue with the changes to the PVP systems, in fact I am very much FOR changes to the pvp systems. But to do that you would have to pretty much start from scratch and rebuild it. Small changes like this will simply deny some people a playstyle they enjoy
---
Again, I am not saying you are wrong. I think that re-implementing the vanilla honour system as it was would not just be bad game design but outright unethical, Blizzaed-can-and-should-get-sued level arsehattery.
---
But we are just talking about twinks here, and it is quite simple. You have some people whose "playstyle they enjoy" is to ruin the game for others, some people whose "playstyle they enjoy" is not to have their game ruined, and a simple fix that boots the griefers out after a reasonable number of matches or quarantines them.
---
I do not disagree with anything else you said. There are good bits to vanilla and bad bits but the honour system is a strong candidate for the most horrifically harmful and unethical game mechanic in computer gaming history. If there's a worse one I never heard of it, even the Final Fantasy bosses that took 24+ hours to die or whatever it was.
---
It still feels epic
---
Yeah but the trial account is essentially useless lol. You could sub and get access up to the second latest expansion but since all new expansions invalidate the previous one that doesn't have much point either (unless I am missing something).
---
Yeah, well, that is not a PuG. That is an established guild, with 35 raiders, taking 5 random players and sell loot.
---
A PuG is 40 random idiots.
---
Oh yeah, Ret still sucked but having that extra instant swing made the difference in PVP. It was a glorious time! 
---
Oh I'm sure Stonetalon's layout was completely intentional, I'm just glad Sunrock has a centralized location in the zone, otherwise it would be more of a ballache than it already is.  Especially being a level 20 zone, the lack of mounts makes it quite the slog.  ST was always a "The party's over, here comes the grind" moment for me as I was leveling.  Winterspring and Felwood were a couple of others like that.
---
I actually thought it would be obvious that the latest expansion would be required. Something about the newest server architecture being updated over time etc. 
---
Would be happy not having to buy legiom etc etc
---
I would guess either late July or August. Battle for Azeroth came out in August to pretty successful sales. Plus a year after BFA has been on the market seems like good time for a major WOW release.
---
Yup, it's what I've been saying since it was announced and people still keep fighting the idea and downvoting my comments. Why in the world would anyone think that dead servers (with no realm merges/transfers, because Vanilla) with a dead economy, dead world, no raids, no WPvP, etc - because people have quit/rerolled to a high pop/high progress server - is better than simply having (yes, I know it's absolutely awful on live) sharding for the first couple of weeks in the early zones?
---
By all means enjoy playing a dead realm though guys, right?
---
I don’t. 
---
Wrath and TBC, while orders of magnitude better than cata and beyond, still do not hold a candle to Classic.
---
Classic is and always will be the gold standard.
---
It’s simply downhill from TBC onward.
---
Flying mounts, compressing the world into a tiny few areas, teleports all over shattrath, death of wpvp......
---
We all have fond memories of TBC and Wrath from when we were younger, and those are awesome memories, but it doesn’t change the fact that those expacs were the beginning of the slow deterioration of the original magical experience that was Classic 
---
Is dat sum SM Armory??
---
I found my pvp video as well, from the same period. So cringy it hurts :(
---
It was in fact with Patch 3.3, the last major patch of Wrath of the Lich King, cross-server from the start.  The Looking For Raid/Raid Finder tool was introduced with the last major patch of Cataclysm, starting with Dragon Soul.
---
There was a Looking For Group tool that was technically sufficient in TBC and most of Wrath, but either people were too stupid to use it or their server was too low-population for it to matter because it was not cross-server.  I feel like the Group Finder of today (not Dungeon Finder) is basically what TBC's tool would have been all the way back then if it had been cross-server.
---
and the circlejerk continues
---
Theres tons of videos of gms doing this on YouTube, literally all of their top comments are people reminiscing of times when a GM had fun with them like this or saying that they wish GMs were still like this.
---
Uh... How do you not notice that?
---
I remember back in 2010 fantasizing about classic wow being released and nine years later im still my sad, pathetic but very excited self 
---
Can not fucking wait at all 
---
Ah I miss my beautiful white horse
---
Oh no, but there was no mention of unbuffed in the OP was there?
---
Correction: every expac after Classic did the same shit. 
---
compress the world into this tiny new area, teleporting, flying mounts, complete change from the world we knew in classic
---
WOTLK did not strike the perfect balance of casual and enjoyability, it became WAY too easy. From 1-70 the levelling was a joke. 70-80 it got to be what you remembered from regular wow. And progression sucked in wotlk.
---
I’m guessing most of the people complaining were also the ones who didn’t play on a low pop realm in Vanilla. My medium pop realm went low and never recovered. As much as I hated Cross-Server connections, it breathed new life into the game for us.
---
I hope Blizzard can find a happy middle ground for this problem once the tourists have gone 
---
Where was the mention of buffed?
---
No, but they're ruining the experience efor the people they play with.
---
another option is to limit PVP much like PVE is limited.  PVE you can only do a raid on a lockout timer. perhaps they could cap your daily BG queue also to maybe 2xAV 5xAB and 10xWSG per 24 hours.  Just playing your allocation in a day would be hard enough but it stops a pre-made group or twink pumping WSG for 11 hours straight..  Some complex problems have even more complex solutions, and some are just better left broken for fear of creating unpredictable results.  
---
I have suggested many alternatives over the years, including an honor per hour system and all get shit on by the extreme #NOCHANGES crowd (I am pretty much in this camp but some people are ridiculous).  I am not sure that this kind of change is likely to happen, but who knows I will play regardless to see if I enjoy it and I will let others worry about an aspect of the game that I am not interested in pursuing seriously.
---
The fact is we have no information about when BG's will release, when the honor system will come into affect and this alone says we are discussing a problem that is not yet relevant.  With retail people were still joining the game even when Naxx was live, some people had characters 2 years old when people were still learning the game. on their 1st.  The disparity in terms of twinking back then compared to now I think will be far less, as everyone can research about item drops and enchants and pots (half of which most people were clueless about back then).    
---
I say this kind of thing is worht worrying about IF a problem occurs.
---
After flying mounts it was never the same mate.
---
Classic stands alone as the king of MMOs. 
---
Everything expac thereafter was a cash grab trying to stay relevant. Lost a bit of awesomeness each time 
---
Because that fucks over anyone who wants to play from the start, who has say, booked time off to go hard and enjoy the game launch and nerd it with their friends, just because I decided I wanted to spend 5 minutes playing on launch to see how many people were in the game.
---
Sharding for the opening zones for the first week or two (if that), is no issue at all.
---
Just enough debt to hide a WoW sub for two years but still enough to crush me morally and longer over my head. The American dream. 
---
There is going to be many more players at classic launch than in vanilla launch.
---
It seems plain to me that the difficulty of a game basically is what makes things fun.  In Classic and TBC, things are easy enough much of the time (not all of the time, I know) that you can do silly stuff like intentionally kill MCed players or try to dash to them during Gruul's Thundering Stomp+Shatter and still clear the raid zones just fine.  Everyone has a laugh and is enjoying themselves.
---
Wrath accidentily made everything way too easy, which sounds bad, but it also made everything so accessible that I'm sure that expansion had the highest ever % of players raiding by far, though the lore helped with that too.  I don't consider LFR raiding, so I'm not counting that.
---
People claim a lot of reasons for why they hated Cataclysm and quit WoW because of it, but to me it just comes down to the fact that the raids were **way** too hard, and that's a trend they've never fully backed down from and nowadays seem to keep going harder and harder on, possibly or not for "e-sports" and "world race" bullshit advertising, but I can't know personally because I quit WoW for personal reasons when 6.0 came.
---
Did you actually play classic
---
Even on pservers where many people already know these fights, MC is still an absolute beast and trash can wipe the group
---
I appreciate your input, but feel like i should let you know, I'm the one getting insulted for no reason here, not the other way around.
---
This.
---
&gt; So, my priest main friends, what do you do to farm up gold? 
---
Herbalism, fishing up nightfin and farming strat live.  Selling either arcanite xmutes or mooncloth.
---
I think majority (if not all) Classes are better in BC is a big reason. 
---
Isn't that the epic sword from Stratholme in the Dwarves hands? 
---
My friend and I no-lifed so hard getting good at wall jumping up anything and everything (SW cathedral comes to mind)
---
Its  
---
# Runeblade of Baron Rivendare :)
---
Loot sharing and sharding *are not confirmed yet*. Blizzard already listened on the content schedule and have changed it to be basically perfect. Give them a fair shot. 
---
I'm sure you'll get excited again when it gets a release date. 
---
Do you think throwing trash on the street is acceptable?
---
God that was awful to watch. Perfect Vanilla video.
---
That’s what I plan on doing
---
They're not even anti-effort, even if doing things properly takes the same effort, they're against it.
---
It will be the same graphics as WotLK  with a toggle to make it pure Classic graphics.
---
No info on whether new models will be available at all yet, no. 
---
First of all, nobody has booked time off yet since there is no release date. And also, taking time off to play an MMO on release day carries that risk. I mean what do people expect? I assume these are adults who have been there for the other blizzard releases where it was unplayable the first few days.

Like i said the issue is that a player new to vanilla should not have a sharded elwynn forest as his first experience in the game. I don't know how anyone can justify that. Vanilla will be crowded, mobs will be taken from you. I mean if they think that's bad wait until they see a non sharded STV 2-3 weeks after release.
---
The 6th guy is stood outside, hoping someone else leaves.
---
Now this is what i like people starting civilised debates, also good questions asked man! Now the PVP part im not to keen on discussing about but the server pop part i feel like its a must to have reliable servers with 5k pop on launch lets be honest one of the things you defo dont want from vanilla are the servers!
---
Unfortunately, we'll have to wait at least 4 months. The waiting is killing me :(
---
(I've been waiting for 1.5 years and, honestly, it's too long).
---
Could be because white vendor items were more expensive than green quest gear. a 3g axe must be better than a 70s axe right?
---
In the regard, WoW vendor stuff is a missed opportunity. They could have done so much more with it. But people only buy the white lvl 1-5 items (which is relatively cheap and gets you more easily to 10). Nobody ever buys a White lvl 45 sword.
---
Oh no please have the server crash 7 times in the first day. Maybe a couple of 30 minute rollbacks. Adds to the AUTHENTIC experience.
---
This isnt me, but it was a guy i was in a group with. I was setting up a ZF group, had 1 spot for a dps, 2 mages whisper me and i invited the first one, and politely said to the mage of one of Europes best guilds that we were full. Big Mistake. 
---
The Mage i had invited had Sold His staff to a vendor since he was expecting to get the staff that dropped in the instance... Aparently this guy had been vendiring parts of his gear before instanses because he knew that on his first run everything he wanted would drop. ( according to what he said )
---
Still a though choice! Leaning towards warrior but still have plenty of time to decide.
---
Druid is out of the question tho, they are no plate wearing sword and board type :).
---
Thanks!
---
If you think looking out for other players is self-entitled, I don't think you understand what that word means.
---
That's more of a subjective matter not objective fact, i thought wotlk's leveling difficulty was in the sweet spot, accessible but still with challenge, vanilla was really hardcore and you actually had to apply strategy to pulling mobs, it was so severe that sometimes you even had to pay attention to the mob walk paths, now maybe to you that was normal difficulty, but i am pretty sure most people would agree vanilla is at the very least more than medium difficulty. 
---
He had Hunter's Mark. Wouldn't make a difference. You can see he Vanishes at 0:53 but he can still see him. Must have been a pre 1.12 video for it to not remove Hunter's Mark though.
---
Truth be told, people don't realize that rogues and warriors are about as low demand as it gets. There are just so many.
---
Ye, i used to heal a lot of Lava runs, it was hard to explain to people how it was done but they were semi comon atleast on my old server
---
&gt;Because you were vague. You could have said "the warrior" instead of "the guy". And you said he was doing "everything wrong" instead of making some mistakes that left DPS on the table. I don't think KT falls down if someone is doing *everything* wrong.
---
He's doing as much wrong in regard to his rotation as he conceivably can. A good warrior uses Bloodthirst, Whirlwind, Heroic Strike, Hamstring for proc fishing and Intercept to increase DPS uptime. This warrior only ever uses Bloodthirst - that's not "some mistakes".
---
&gt;I guess to you "asking you if you have any direct experience of vanilla raiding or vanilla elite culture at all" is "shutting down"? Because you seem to have dodged that question.
---
I started playing during TBC, but I don't see how that has any bearing on my ability to spot when people are not playing correctly.
---
&gt;I'm not saying every vanilla raider was perfect or anything like it. But if you weren't around for the EJ forums and weren't engaged with the serious players in the vanilla era you could easily fall victim to the uninformed pirate server circlejerk that none of the millions upon millions of retail vanilla players was anything other than a drooling moron, while near 100% of the few thousand pirate server raiders are God's gift to the 40 actions-per-minute world of elite gaming.
---
The problem is that when you see concrete and specific examples of bad play, you always just handwave them away instead of engaging with the argument. If you look at private server videos and compare them to retail, the players clearly are better and more prepared - that's a fact.
---
&gt;It's obviously a bad faith move to compare a "speed run" *which wipes* with one that doesn't. That's not apples to apples. Do you think that never ever in the history of retail vanilla a Naxx guild cleared MC without wiping?
---
The speedrun I'm talking about is the one that took 1.5 hours. Since you were talking about 1.5 hours as being the time it took to speedrun MC in Vanilla, I assumed that was what you were talking about. Are you now saying that it actually takes less than 1.5 hours?
---
I like how you go "auras" for paladins but list all the Shammy totems. I smell horde favoritism! ;p
---
Idk about classic but in vanilla it’s 19 rogue. Ambush crits one shot clothies so easy
---
pretty sure u need as good pc as u need for bfa
---
Hell, I've played a hunter to 85 and never done the quest so I wouldnt know what it was.
---
I wonder how many players back in 2005 quit the game because they found the combat to be too boring.... Because they never trained skills.
---
My most played bracket is the 19 level range, but my most fun bracket would have to be the 29 level range. A bit more abilities, and fights last a tiny bit longer. Rogue with dual torturing powers with crusader and +15 agitators. Stalk clothies and ambush them lol
---
Agreed, I spend a good bit of my day rolling over class possibilities in my heads and thinking about strengths, weaknesses, etc. Just trying to decide on "the one" that has the downsides that I can live with in pvp.
---
Mage - boring pve, lock/shaman/pally are very annoying to deal with
---
Lock - boring pve, no escape options, few cooldowns to get out of ohshit situations, dots dispelled all the time
---
Rogue - better pve, spend most of time guarding flags, turns into a punching bag if cooldowns are down and your out of stealth
---
Warrior - best pve, very rough to play solo in bgs, spend most of your time rooted or getting focus fired if you charge something
---
No they aren't. They would be three separate servers, with shared profiles. This would mean you could have 1 2 3 with a populatin of 3000 each and once the rush is over, you'll merge them for a combined 5-6000 population.
---
Sharding is a technology by Blizzard that creates realms within realms, effectively draining players from your shard or spitting you out of your shard, depending on who it selects, which means you're seeing 5 players questing and suddenly they are gone. It's also possible to group up into a different shard, further damaging the atmosphere of playing an MMORPG.
---
Having three realms that are separate, with the knowledge of them being merged after a week or two, would eliminate the need for sharding.
---
It hasn't been confirmed no, and off the top of my head I don't think they've publicly discussed this.. correct me if I'm wrong! I do hope they don't add this, that's just my personal opinion, I love me some pixelated sharp edge clunky goodness. It's all down to the player isn't it. I can't stand the new animations now, it doesn't feel good
---
Yeah it's broken. Especially with wand talent and gravestone scepter. Slap on 100 hp chest legs head and your eaisly sitting at 1.3k health
---
Oh the memories!
---
I still vividly remember getting the arnea grand master trinket from the Gurubashi Arena on my level 19 twink. I did it without any help and I think it took almost a month on my low pop server until I had it.
---
That fishing event was also always super fun to do, never won though.
---
Retail is that way ———&gt; r/wow
---
Thank you so much, mate.
---
This is really going to be helpful!
---
I would argue against this as it would clash with retail wow patch being released in august 
---
Lol if there’s one thing I learned about Reddit and today’s gaming community: y’all a bunch of GJW (gaming justice warriors) who get offended over any and everything. 
---
Jeeze, dude. I just wanted to share what *I* loved about the game. And I'm here in the first place because I'm *looking forward* to playing the stuff I missed.
---
From the demo: They're using the old character models with graphics option from Legion, so modern shadows, water, etc. with old animations etc.
---
could probably just pick how many pieces of raid gear and what bosses they drop from and give a % chance you have some idea what you are doing. 
---
Found my first blue item from a high level quest-harpy in barrens. Though it was a more powerful special harpy that always had good loot. Spent like a week spawn camping that same harpy without getting more than a few greens. 
---
I actually used this very image for my high school final thesis... those were good days!
---
Thats a no from me dawg.
---
thank you sir
---
This thread doesn't really need to exist, just saying.
---
Still no. I'm going to play classic for the nostalgia so sharding is still bad imo. 
---
I imagine it's going to feel pretty different playing with sharding.
---
It's not as if a little bit of cluster fuck the first week is a bad thing. It's awesome! I was looking forward to it.
---
I think I'll be running a gnome mage so I can give you my general plan. Firstly I'll create my character (name and appearance already planned) and get to lvl5/6 in the gnome starting zones. Then I'll walk over to Iron Forge, learn my professions (tailoring &amp; skinning/mining, fishing), buy some profession materials (skinning knife/mining pick), then take the tram over to Stormwind. Then I'll start questing in Elwyn and eventually Westfall as I really like these zones and the nostalgia hit will be big for me. I'm going to be playing as I want to play, which will involve levelling my professions alongside my character and not rushing. I'm planning to do as many instances as I can do on my way to 60, I'm going to use a level requirement spreadsheet that I made so I know roughly what level to start looking for a group. Just going to be taking my time honestly, making some G when I can craft 12 slot bags, rolling an alt (human paladin) along the way, etc. Every X9 level (19, 29, 39, etc.) I'll probably do a day or two of PvP (if its out, if not then I won't - I think it won't be but still thinking about it). I \*might\* start a guild with an IRL friend of mine who I have semi-convinced to start playing WoW again come summer - the guild will be a casual levelling guild with some hope of instancing/raiding at max. If you are interested in joining me levelling or to chat, hit me up! I'll be playing an EU server (UK timezone), Alliance.
---
Gathering professions as you level. Then go alchemy (for g making)/tailoring (for chest). Fishing and cooking. Make a level 5 alt, get enchanting, disenchant everything, sell on AH. Being clever on the AH with drops, gear/items, mats etc. Quests that give bags. Not going crazy on the AH - don't buy any gear when levelling. Offering healing services. Farming cloths. There's loads of ways :D
---
But classic is already a custom project, so we might as well improve it while we are at it.
---
Most like Legion, as that's the base client, but you have to remember that they're only using the super old zones, old character models etc. Going with the "classic" graphics preset and you can probably run the game on a toaster.
---
5000 in one area ? I think you have the maths wrong there mate
---
Could you also link it to me as well please?
---
Get more servers.
---
Isn't that the stairs that lead to Cannon Master Willey in StratLiving?
---
With the patrolling battlemages?
---
If I get to a quest item and see 20+ people queued up, I’m gonna move on to my next quest. At level 5, grinding is faster than waiting for that one item. 
---
Seeing your post history is nothing but complaining about adding QOL changes to classic and you’re even defending sharding
---
“It’s only for the first week or so”
---
You’re obviously the wrong audience and you should unsubscribe and never join this subreddit again thx.
---
Why would a drwarf have that sword? silly dworf... that is a human sword...
---
How good can your gear be without a xp off button ?
---
You would have to be very lucky to get the pve gear you want before lvl 20.
---
I can only remember this becoming a problem later after they introduced that button and people going 100-0 in lvl 60 AV everytime. (greetings to Betaglanz EU-Destromath :)
---
Blizzard can definitely balance how easily people go from shards to shard and how these shards are designed (in player and actual size.) the grouping up is a problem, but it is much more preferable than the queues you'd get with numbered servers. Or if say some of your friends actually start after launch and your number is already full, at least you can play with them. 
---
&gt;But considering everyones access to detailed breakdowns of the fights, and how mechanically skilled players are these days
---
Just out of curiosity here, but what makes you think players are going to be more mechanically skilled?
---
The simple existence of information in no way ensures that players will take advantage of it. We might not have had Youtube back in vanilla (at least, anything like the modern version) but there were plenty of class guides around, and mechanics of MC at least were well known. And yet many players at 60 were utterly hopeless. 
---
Consider the wealth of information available for virtually any game today, then further consider that those games are still filled with people who barely know how to play said game. 
---
Classic will be no different. There will be mechanically skilled players around, just like there were back in vanilla. And I'm willing to bet there'll be just as many clueless people running around too. 
---
This is a really great idea about having a tick-list. I think your best bet would be to make it yourself though, open up Excel (or any free spreadsheet software - Open Office) and create a list of things that you might want to do. You have several months to research the things you note now, and you can easily create yourself a nice, bespoke list before Classic drops. Post back when you have it, I'm sure others will find it handy (myself included!). 
---
I look back on scholo and strath being 10 man raids fondly. I remember being sad when they changed them.
---
YES PLEASE THIS!!!!1!!!
---
I caved.... I went on a private server and triend lvling at my old pace withought relying on anyone or Ah. Trying to simulate a new server im just lvl 17 though :P but there is so much i would have messed at launch if i had not done this :P I ran out of quests in elwin forest because i didnt notice a few quest givers...also priests have to go to darnassus to pick up staffs at lvl 10.... 
---
You can do lashers with mage, druid, priest, paladin... surely you can do it with warlock too. The fact that mages are the richest class IS VANILLA LIKE. You had problems getting gold on some classes and others had it easier.
---
Made me hard just a lil' bit
---
This needs to much much much higher up
---
And people learn to master hunters very slowly too...they 're so forgiving. Even if you play like a total nOOb, as long as your pet lives, mobs die anyway.
---
It's a promotional picture from blizz back in the day.
---
well, no, because any server achitecture would have to be applied to the areas outside of the new expansion areas, right? like whatever expansion introduced sharding (cant recall), it wasn't limited to the newest areas, nor did it lock people who hadn't bought the new expack out
---
"might as well improve it" is what got us where we are now. 
---
If it is necessary then yes, what's wrong with waiting ? If you can't wait for an hour to log in and play I am sorry to say but vanilla has a whole lot of that in its gameplay.
---
Ah. An Alex parrot
---
&gt; The logic is "shove it down their throats until they get the message".
---
You arent shoving it down their throats, you are shoving it to everyones throat. And if you think ILL SPAM UNTILL YOU DO THE CHANGE is the way to go, i can tell you, thats why current retail is the way it is.
---
Them listening the guys that shouted the loudest and most. They know everything we want, now let them finish the game. 
---
my point is that if you can sub and still play modern wow without the latest expansion even though as you've said it's kinda useless (unless you're leveling or entirely focused on say, achievement hunting), no way they'd make you buy the new expansion to play classic when it and all that came before are actually useless
---
inb4 ''but activision evil cash grab'' if they really wanted to they could've forced u to buy the new expansion to play modern wow by now but they don't
---
My twink story. I started a Warlock on a separate server from my main for the sole purpose of being a twink. I got to the lvl 20s and made it to some high level fishing areas by dying over and over then hearthstoning. I would fish for hours and make hundreds of gold just to buy blues to use in the battlegrounds. I was the number one Warlock on my server at my level. It was awesome. The fact that he was my main on the server was a pride thing. People still hated me, oh well, it was a blast.
---
I don't know if sharding is the best solution. But I do know that launch back in 2004 was absolutely horrible. 
---
Servers crashed constantly. Getting virtually anything done was a struggle. Hour long queues. Impossible lag. Things were pretty much unplayable, and whilst people today might be looking back misty eyed and nostalgic for those days, players then were bloody furious. Blizzard ended up having to refund game-time to players, and Mike posted a big official apology on the forums, promising improvements. 
---
If Classic was a free game, all this might fly. But Blizzard is going to want to avoid all those issues like the plague. They don't want to be swamped by paying customers demanding to know why they can't play the game they paid for. It was bad enough press back in 2004. Imagine the chaos today. 
---
Like I said, I don't know if sharding is the best solution. But I do know that Blizzard is going to do anything to prevent a repeat of the original release. 
---
Ive done this on a private server and felt bad killing horse players. I personally will have an alliance alt but couldn’t main alliance.
---
Ehhh good priests would rarely use flash of light. Too much mana intensive. Greater heal at different ranks tho + renew + dispel.
---
Hey, I'll have you know I've been consistent in my hatred for the devilspawn that is WoTLK for a decade, thank you very much!
---
Honestly the pvp system in general is something I would like to see changed (oh no changes!) rank 14 grind is extremely unhealthy, both mentally and physically for any players who want to attempt it, and the worst part is wow is marketed toward teens who are entirely willing to fuck up their lives over something stupid. People have literally died playing video games for the kind of marathon sessions required to get rank 14.
---
Lol! 
---
how did u have time to farm gold for raid consumables then?
---
&gt;Is widely considered the best raid of all WoW
---
By who? You?
---
Let me come to a subreddit all about this one game and tell people just how unexcited I am for this game. Beep beep, quality commentary coming through!
---
Says the person whining on the internet about a video game not being released fast enough to make him happy...
---
YEAH BUT WILL DME MAGE AOE FARM BE NERFED DOWNVOTED!!!
---
This is easily the worst "solution" I've read on this subreddit. I'm not even saying that to be mean. How did you even come up with this? 
---
I’m not hitting 60 in a week and so aren’t most others.
---
You forgot the /s OP.
---
U should enter pvp with Revolution Deathsquad - Dragon Force
---
or Raining Blood - Slayer, like FloridaMan
---
Surely the Fishing should come with the ZG content update?
---
Yeah he uses it frequently, it's originally from a blizzard promotion for wow though 
---
Same here tbh....the feels
---
Seems like you did if you're trying to imply adding a selection list somehow turns sharding into something else entirely. 
---
Herbalism/mining
---
Top of Org bank for inspection 
---
I didn't come up with it, it's how a lot of servers have handled this issue in the past. What makes it bad?
---
Take herbalism (and enchanting for group gold grind). 
---
Solo:
---
DME lashers can be easily be killed with holy nova spam, you only need like 6k mana to do it. You can get 2-3 herb nodes (dreamfoil, gromsblood) while down there. Additionally you could get lucky with a book spawn and get furors from it.
---
With herbalism you can always go run around the world for black lotuses.
---
Duo: 
---
Take your friendly warrior and do DME 3 boss runs. Kill hydro, sacrifice guy and last boss as 2man team. Enchanting will result in a big boost to your gold gain (and time you can keep doing it). This opens up Ghost mushroom spawns (or you can clear the trahs packs near the spwns), you should get 1-3 spawns per run. The warrior should have mining for behind the last boss, theres 3-4 nodes.
---
Or you can levelup a mage/hunter alt.
---
I can't see any reason they wouldn't be. If people want to rush and farm them I don't it's fair to try and stop them.
---
R.I.P T-Bag
---
I'm not playing retail anymore so I have no clue when the next patch is coming. Is it released in August? Did they already announced a fix date? Last time I looked for it, they said it will come mid 2019, but that was in late 2018 and like I said, haven't realy looked for it since then. But sure, if they release patch 8.2 (?) in August, they wont release classic at the same month.
---
It was implied. 
---
Learning off my friend that I didnt have to spam the auto attack button
---
The sit macro worked even after the patch, but only when spamming it and the server thinking you already stood up (server lag).
---
With new servers, better connections and another chance for them to fix this I wouldnt count on this being reliable.
---
This was a great south park episode
---
That's like saying take away a Hunter's pet and ranged attacks
---
Good point #nochanges! 
---
Splitting your player base and denying people access based on something arbitrary is going to breed a massive amount of resentment from people who want to be playing but aren't. This would be similar to having a beta and then not wiping the data, it just doesn't happen. People want to be on even footing when they start on new servers, it would ruin the experience for a lot of people. 
---
I'll take sharding and unstable servers at launch over this 10/10 times. As long as the servers have a reasonable cap, hell even a faction cap would be wonderful, and people lose the idea of these mega servers with 2x-5x the amount of players, sharding a few early zones is a much more elegant and realistic solution. 
---
That's fair, I feel like this is an incredible incentive for goblins to make an absolute killing, as most goblins I know have not thought about this. Sitting on 10-15 Black Lotus until the price skyrockets can give you a comfortable 5k-10k eventually depending on inflation from instance runs.
---
Just need you to know I had a good hearty chuckle at this. Thank you good citizen of the internet. 
---
*tips hat*
---
People have (I've seen posts about it, those who can change it but need a rough date), and people will as soon as we get a date. Regardless of when that is, people will still have holidays booked for it.
---
Sharding isn't going to ruin their experience because they can't see the other thousand people, they probably won't notice the difference between 1k and 2k because they still won't be able to kill anything. 
---
Classic WoW is coming back, Halo is coming back.... WHAT YEAR IS IT?!?!?!
---
That's not how inflation works.
---
Disappointed with the lack of Gnome rep. Though this does seem somewhat accurate of vanilla race population distribution... maybe swap a human for an Elf to be more accurate.
---
R.I.P.
---
Luckily healers and tanks usually dont NEED the same gear, righttt ? Only becomes bit of a issue in early naxx, if you share the token with a warrior. Aka at least paladins, cant remember the other classes.
---
True, it can be pretty rough if you have no healers or can't talk someone into healbotting you
---
Is it really that close? I was thinking it is still a year out at least.
---
I learn fast :)
---
If you’re going to make a graph of the deterioration, technically classic is the first point on that downward slope. Incremental changes always happen. Lessons learned in classic drove the team to make changes in BC, and no player can say with absolute certainty that classic was perfect, as it was far from; a game of that magnitude doesn’t mature in 2 years. Subsequently, lessons learned in BC drove the changes in Wrath. The problem is, the lessons learned in classic no longer influence the latter expansions, and it becomes disconnected with its roots, much like the game of telephone.
---
This is not a concern: capital cities have never been sharded in WoW's lifetime.
---
But now i am old and look like this irl. And it's not so cool anymore.
---
Oh you might be right.  Hard telling with the same-y looking scarlet architecture.  This was taken moments before everyone rolled need on the Cannonball Runner
---
Players who twink has evolved from a bunch of senseless ganking into a pretty hardcore community that loves competition, this is true.
---
However, locking them in their own bracket gives them horrible queue times, and basically destroys every bracket above 19 overnight. 
---
So, no, this would not be in service to the twinkling community. 
---
I just don’t understand why people keep making threads about “let’s keep everything the same, except that one thing I didn’t like.” 
---
Just let the game be the game. Why, of all the things, would they change this? 
---
Mine was reading pet taunt "forces the target to attack you" and thinking it meant the target would attack my hunter and I didn't want that, so I turned it off. 
---
&gt; He's doing as much wrong in regard to his rotation as he conceivably can. A good warrior uses Bloodthirst, Whirlwind, Heroic Strike, Hamstring for proc fishing and Intercept to increase DPS uptime. This warrior only ever uses Bloodthirst - that's not "some mistakes".
---
I looked at the video and with potato resolution I have no idea what is going on and I am not sure how you think you do. He seems to have been on filming and offtank duty or something, and perhaps got told to save all his rage for the bugs at the end? I don't know.
---
Like I said, they aren't here to defend themselves and you by your own admission don't know how the fight goes or what they were meant to be doing.
---
&gt; I started playing during TBC, but I don't see how that has any bearing on my ability to spot when people are not playing correctly.
---
We need to know our own limitations. If you never played vanilla seriously and have absolutely no first-hand experience of even medium-level play, you have only been soaked in pirate server circlejerking about how great they are compared to real vanilla players, then you probably aren't entitled to an opinion.
---
&gt; The problem is that when you see concrete and specific examples of bad play, you always just handwave them away instead of engaging with the argument.
---
That's because evidence needs to be proportional to the claim. You can't say "all retail vanilla players were mouthbreathing incompetents" to someone who has actual first-hand experience of the game at the time, and knows you are wrong from direct experience, and "prove" it with one or two cherry-picked videos that you claim show someone playing badly.
---
It's like saying "all dogs are pit bulls, look here is a video of one pit bull, stop handwaving away my evidence and engage with my argument!". To someone who owned several dogs that were not pit bulls.
---
&gt; The speedrun I'm talking about is the one that took 1.5 hours. Since you were talking about 1.5 hours as being the time it took to speedrun MC in Vanilla, I assumed that was what you were talking about. Are you now saying that it actually takes less than 1.5 hours?
---
Very little evidence from the time exists. And despite the hordes of people here who claim they were Naxx raiders in retail vanilla almost none of them seem to have any relevant memories. (Which would be puzzling if one did not already think they were mostly full of it.) But if your sample consists of one data point which is badly flawed, you don't really know.
---
rip my dream of using it for pve dps
---
For those who loved WPvP WotLK ruined the game, for those who loved the lore WotLK was the best exp so far
---
Cya then
---
I used to do that, not because I was dumb but because english wasnt my first language, I was young and I didnt understand what they want me to do. I ended up doing just the "speak with" quests and grinding.
---
No it doesn’t and no they won’t.
---
You don't need to defend a choice in vanilla. There is no failed esport to be punished with for not picking the ideal spec and raiding is only the be all end all in late Naxx and AQ. In Naxx PvP is awful anyways.
---
You couldn't pay me to play a ret paladin but I could say the same thing about SL Lock (or any lock spec for that matter) and BM Hunter. All these specs are in the game for a reason though. People like different things. If I wanted a game where everything played the same I would be in BFA.
---
&gt; How much will it annoy mages that instead of every priest wanting 40 water they now want 80. 
---
They'll probably be happy about it since conjuring those 80 is easier than conjuring 40 of the better water :P
---
I was thinking more in terms of bag space for raids, but I get your point, the first 20mins of every raid is casting water :)
---
Talking about played time in hours...
---
Here at wow we talk in Days!
---
I've never player RS before so I cant help you with comparisons. But I played some other MMO's and vanilla wow was the perfect balance between hardcore and casual. Casuals dont need to go hardcore to get somewhere and hardcore's has a chance to seperate themselfs from the casuals.
---
Why isn’t it glowing purple
---
Black Lotus only spawns in high level zones and usually have at least some mobs close to it, chances in getting to pick them without getting killed seems slim at best. Also leveling herb to 300 as a 35 without mount even as a hunter will take quite some time. 
---
If Lotus is bop you won’t be able to do anything with them until the patch when they are no longer soulbound since they can only be crafted into flasks in Scholo/BWL unless you level that char and get the recipe, and if you plan to do that you might as well just push for 60 to have an easier time farming and contesting them
---
Because of the "could reach" bit, to clarify
---
Resource scarcity is part of Vanilla WoW.
---
If you are collecting X from mob Y with two people, theoretically it will take you the same time as doing it solo (providing you collect for both the people, there are enough mobs, and you are both doing similar damage).
---
People group up for the actual quests that need 2-3 people. The quests that require 10 boar meat aren't designed for multiple people. 
---
I was a ... 58 hunter or something, not 60 for sure, but Close to it.
---
My father told me "yeah Reputation factions sell blueprints, you gotta farm them!"
---
So I went farming furlborgs in western winterspring. Farmed for hours, got stacked up on the firewater and random bullshit ... then there it was. LIFESTONE. Epic fucking trinket, I was so confused, didnt know if I should use it or sell it or whatever.
---
In the end, I sold it for like 30g or something, as it wasnt so strong and there were a ton in the auction house.
---
Here's a general breakdown of the raid bosses available and if they're 1 or 2 tanked generally speaking.
---
Molten Core:
---
Lucifron - 2 tanked, can be 1 tanked when on farm.
---
Magmadar - 1 tank
---
Gehennas - See lucifron
---
Garr - 2 tanked
---
Baron Geddon - 1 tanked
---
shazzrah - 1 tanked
---
Sulfuron - 2 tanked
---
Golemagg - 2 tanked
---
Majordomo Executus - 2 tanked
---
Ragnaros - 2 tanked, 1 tanked when DPS is high enough to skip sons.
---
Massively overgeared (2+ tiers): The entire place is 1 tankable
---
Blackwing Lair:
---
Razorgore - 2 tanked
---
Vael - 2 tanked (here you'll probably even MT as the OT and act sacrificial lamb)
---
Broodlord - 2 tanked
---
3 drakes: 2 tanked
---
Chromaggus: 1 tanked
---
Nefarian: 2 tanked
---
Massively overgeared: Requires very high DPS to turn a few 2 tank fights into 1 tank fights.
---
Zul'Gurub:
---
Jek'lik: 1 tanked
---
Venoxis: 1 tanked
---
Mar'li: 2 tanked
---
Bloodlord Mandokir: 2 tanked, 1 tanked with great gear.
---
Thekal: 2 tanked, can be 1 tanked with decently coordinated raid.
---
Arlokk: 1 tanked
---
Jin'do: 1 tanked
---
Hakkar: 2 tanked
---
Edge of Madness/gahz'ranka : 1 tanked as general rule
---
Massively overgeared: Can 1 tank everything save Hakkar due to Mind Control.
---
Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj:
---
Fankriss: 2 tanked, insane DPS required to be 1 tanked
---
Rajaxx: 2 tanked
---
Buru: 1 tanked
---
Moam: 1 tanked
---
Ayamiss: 1 tanked
---
Ossirian: 2 tanked
---
Massively overgeared: Fankriss and Rajaxx could be 1 tanked, Ossirian requires 2.
---
Temple of Ahn'Qiraj
---
Skeram: 2 tanked
---
Bug trio: 2 tanked
---
Sartura: 2 tanked
---
Fankriss: 1 tanked
---
Viscidus: 1 tanked
---
Huhuran: 2 tanked
---
Twin emperors: 2 tanked
---
C'thun: 1 tanked
---
Massively overgeared: Could get by with 1 tank up to twins, twins requires two dedicated tanks.
---
Naxxramas (Needs verification):
---
Patchwerk: 3 tanked
---
Grobbelus: 1 tanked
---
Gluth: 2 tanked
---
Thaddius: 2 tanked
---
Noth: 2 tanked
---
Heigan: 1 tanked
---
Loatheb: 1 tanked
---
Razuvious: 1 tanked
---
Gothik: 2 tanked
---
Four horsemen: 5-6 tanked
---
Anub'rekhan: 2 tanked
---
Faerlina: 2 tanked
---
Maexxna: 2 tanked
---
Sapphiron: 1 tanked
---
Kel'Thuzad: 2 tanked
---
BiS geared: Probably doesn't do much in this instance, Maexxna Faerlina, Anub'Rekhan and Noth might be doable, some easier than others.
---
Conclusion: On roughly half the bosses the OT doesn't have a lot to do, this gets a lot better in AQ and especially Naxxramas, this doesn't account for trash mobs where an OT is invaluable.
---
 In the massively overgeared section it's entirely possible to have additional tanks be DPS warriors strapping into tank gear, this would work up to but not including Twins and beyond.
---
In the end you may have more fun playing a druid since most guilds want at least one for the versatility of slipping into bear form when needed and cat otherwise, doesn't hold up against a boss like Twins though for instance which requires two warriors. Also to note the primary OT usually ends up the MT for that second raid group of alts, weekend ZGs or what have you.
---
Taran icebreaker I think used it on my pally for a while but should have sold it in hindsight. Dropped outside black rock mountain 
---
&gt; Holding aggro with a huge margin is irrelevant most of the time.
---
Means I get to actually press the heroic strike button as a fury warrior as well, MOAR THREAT TO THE PEEPZ!
---
You got both suggestions. Watch MadSeasonShow for the casual, flavorful approach to the game, then watch Kargoz for the min/max breakdowns that explore the limits of the game. I think both are invaluable and the best in their class for assessing how to approach the game. Mad is about the journey, Kargoz is about the end.
---
I don’t think he’s a great speaker. He’s articulate. I understand. That said, the way he has to filter his thoughts through Blizzard’s guidelines makes his statements too long and difficult to follow. That said, he is at least trying.
---
Yeah it would probably be very hard to gather but a hunter with good pet control could probably snatch up several nodes (With a lot of deaths in between). I think it's patch 1.7 before they stop being soulbound so you would definitely need to level alchemy and get the recipies.
---
wOTLK IS TRASH
---
I think if I ever get another Warden stafd I'll cry from nostalgia feels. 
---
I can't remeber how much I made off the staff but I'm pretty sure it was enough to afford riding skill finally. I was a kid and sucked at making gold then, once I grew up some and when I still played (stopped at legion) running the AH was my favorite thing to do. 
---
I just always wished there was a 1v1 arena.
---
I just know that when I finally get Ironfoe after my 300 something runs that's when blizzard realizes that it has say a 10% proc chance with no ICD and nerfs the everliving shit out of it.
---
What a savage move to just drop it not even to vendor the poor thing haha 
---
Pug is pick up group we can and could pug People into our raids.
---
Krol Blade - Dropped during farming Tyrs Hand for my epic mount I think... If I'm correct I sold it for about 350-400g.
---
No one is offended by your post. We are just making fun of you.
---
Flurry Axe. It dropped off an ogre in Arathi Highlands.
---
I thought the level 40 unarmored mounts were removed when servers were 1.4. Since we're starting at 1.12, can't we assume that?
---
Thanks for your opinion, don't let the door hit you on the way out!
---
No. The question is will the questline be available up until you need to go to DM at launch at least.
---
Now that's a sick fuckin drop what a sexy wep it was
---
This is horrible, I love it.
---
Even going back to get it at 80 and being able to smash the zone, it took me weeks to get, going in there for 8 hours at a time some days.
---
I murder ppl in stv just for the sake of killing them 
---
The nights and lighting are correct in the Classic Demo and this person was able to get into a few zones so check out their channel for more.

Now as far as weather. The frequency and intensity were great in vanilla but I think the modern game CAN do it as well or better with their weather 2.0 system. It just is never used much probably due to performance. With Vanilla being so easy to run I doubt that would be a problem and they could really push it as shown in the first vid.
---

---
I'm actually not a fan of some of the urine colored filters in Classic and when they push the 2.0 weather system they can do better "fog" with clouds of mist that is shown in Feralas in the first video. 
---
I imagine they are testing both if it's possible to use the old one. Might have just not made a decision yet. Understand if you don't like the new weather but I prefer it. Weather intensity, dark nights are things I care about more. I also like the new highest setting water due to reflections. I don't like the new water settings below that though.Reflections make it worth it imo. They are just kind of hard to run in some areas. Again that won't be a problem with classic.
---
My money would be on RMP with a 3 minute mage and assassination rogue, the control and burst would be great against vanilla-style PVP trinkets.
---
Or just *not* explain it in-universe.
---
While I agree with you that there is a lot of min/max hate on this sub. I feel we as a community should be encouraging all people to play how they have the most fun. You are not obligated to raid with an enhance Shaman, nor should you if maximum efficiency is your goal or how you have fun playing. You will find plenty of like minded people to raid with. We need people of different playstyles to make the game world feel more organic and alive. I plan on playing Spriest almost exclusively, PvP is my favorite. Will I heal? sure if I am asked. Will I get mad if a pug or my guild chooses to take a more efficient class to raid? No, I accept the limitations of my chosen spec and will raid if and when I can. Or just respec occasionally and heal in raids. People need to play what is fun for them for this game to thrive. But they also need to have realistic expectations of the spec they choose to play. 
---
Hunter action bars always look like my full bags after questing. I don't know what any of those abilities do. It's the only class I never cared about.
---
That's not true. Shifting ensures you always have a clean hotbar since shifting changes it. So you always have like 6-12 abilities using the same hotkeys.
---
After spying on the alliance for years I'm done with that mission and can finally play the right faction.
---
I've led pugs on one of the Pservers, well "pugs". I was the guild leader of one of the better PvE guilds on the server, but playing the main tank I'd rarely if ever get to bring any of my alts to a raid so I organized my own on weekends, sent the word around to various other guilds who were similiar to us and they got their alts going.
---
In about a month we'd gone from raiding MC to killing C'thun and catching up to our respective guilds' progress (Naxx hadn't yet been released)
---
So this may not be your ordinary pug, and after a while of the same people showing up we got rather coordinated, but using the same methodology I don't see why it wouldn't work in Classic.
---
Lol 
---
"I want to wait in line 3 hours to play a game"
---
"Play in the middle of the night"
---
Fuck me this community had grade A spanners in it. 
---
For sure, I just really like how old wow used to go this muddy grey kind of colour when it rained or went muggy. Like [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pinksyllibus/3929956648/)
---
Thanks for crediting the artist. 
---
Didn't see any epics until I started raiding, so it would have been something from ZG. Obviously I wasn't excited enough to put it to memory
---
It’s cool because even if you have max level engineering or enchanting etc, another engineer may still be better than you because he has found scrolls, blueprints or schematics that allow him to do many different things with his skill than you can do.
---
For example A lot of enchantment scrolls are found by doing dungeons or questing, once you find them you can add them to your skill book and can permanently do that enchantment :)  (if you have the level and right item materials) 
---
And then you could come up behind that gate in the NE canal, waiting for passersby to be awed
---
I was 12 and was allowed 1 candy from the jar a day.
---
Even still some the coolest epics aestheticaly came from ZG so still a great place for a first. 
---
I could swear to god it was some cloth gloves or bracers that dropped in Uldaman, but I can't find them on the databases. Everyone rolled need to sell, I won and got kicked by a salty tank  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
You can find some hope in the light then
---
Absolutely! Loved the ZG aesthetic. Especially as I was playing a troll shaman
---
MC is OP &lt;3
---
Source: i play priest
---
I honestly do not get why sharding is such a major issue when Blizzard want to impliment loot sharing. That's a much worse crime imo.
---
Classic!  (Pun intended)
---
No, please no arena :(
---
Don't get me wrong, arena was fun. But i always had a major gripe with it. PvP stopped being Horde v Alliance clashing over territory and lore significant strategic locations/resources and instead devolved into a e-peen comp vs comp mode. I don't want to come of as an elitist purist, but this is genuinely how i feel. Imo it just doesn't fit, especially not within the Classic universe. Having Horde and Alliance exclusive classes available would also fuck balance completely. 
---
No, that's 100% a healer weapon. There's plenty of other weapons without +healing. If he didn't need it, sure, but you'd check first. 
---
So private Server talk is now permitted? 
---
I would like the option of a toggle, I wouldn’t use the toggle but I have 5 friends who are going to play classic with me that have never played wow before and they want new graphics options.
---
With that said, I’m pretty sure toggles are hard to make work and won’t be included 
---
That's what kills it for me, I want whatever keeps healthy server populations first and foremost, secondly I don't want to rename a character I will have played with for years
---
&gt;That difficulty and novelty is part of the experience of the first few weeks of a new server.
---
Apples 🍎 and oranges 🍊. 
---
The first few weeks for a new server will have people who are *dedicated* to staying and playing, no matter how inconvenient it is. They purchased the game and they’re going to try and get their money’s worth.
---
Classic, doesn’t have this luxury. At launch, there will be several thousands of tourists who create characters with no long term aspirations. Every character they create will eat up the server population. Many of them won’t make it to lvl20.
---
Now your server pop is full, but a percentage of your population will likely never log on again (let’s say 15-25%). How do you solve this? 
---
1. Just let it happen? Dead realms and complaints of low pop is what pushed Blizzard into Cross Realm BGs (and later PVE) in the first place. It’s also bad for the economy and makes grouping difficult when there simply aren’t enough people leveling in your range to run a dungeon. (Hello Scilla vets!)
---
2. Delete inactive characters? When guild/bank alts get deleted, that’s going to spark an uproar. 
---
What other solutions do you have?
---
As long as I know it is. You are just not allowed to name them.
---
Krol Blade, as a Rogue. Dropped for me around level 55-59 (can't quite remember, but definitely before 60). Used that for quite a while.
---
Bloodrazor in Maraudon. 
---
Doing research myself atm, and well i can assure you most forums or threads don't recommend druid at all, people just see downsides in him. People throw in all the same classes over and over again not even looking at the patches and realizing that in 1.12 some things were just not that good like before.
---
Another thing is i don't really believe people back then would play all classes at maximum potential like today.
---
Still i am also worried to pick a druid having in mind that i want to push for R14 in BG.
---
Yeah the Feralas footage looks like that a bit. This should start at the right time.
---
[https://youtu.be/t9wdoxbfpqs?t=190](https://youtu.be/t9wdoxbfpqs?t=190)
---
It's never on by default though I guess as the guy showed. Wish his video was a little higher quality but it has good information. I can't seem to find anyone else who played with this stuff.
---
[https://youtu.be/t9wdoxbfpqs?t=529](https://youtu.be/t9wdoxbfpqs?t=529)
---
That is kind of cool as well. They can do sandstorms which would be really neat in things like Tanaris or the Raceway.
---
Later
---
&gt; The "tourists" that they're so worried about scaring away won't be so bent out of shape for not being the first to level 60. They can start a day later, or a week later.
---
This is so ridiculous I am not sure if you are not just trolling tbh. How on earth do you plan going out there convincing Johnny Awesome to try out this cool new Classic wow that is so hype one day later?? In 2019, an age where people actually take days off to be able to play a game on launch day?
---
Do you plan to query people "are you a tourist?" when they log on, and then if they answer yes, you tell them to come back tomorrow? Or you expect he will just say whatever and log in a day or two later when he sees the queues?
---
Or will he simply hop on a low pop server, which then will be abandoned two days after launch because it had 2000 tourists try out the game on it, and the dedicated 500 who happened to create a char there are now shit out of luck.
---
The whole fucking point is, if you start a server with 3000 pop, and 50% of that is tourists (which due to twitch/social media/literally free game for retail subs/etc hype is completely possible), then after 1-2 weeks some servers might end up with &lt;1000k population. Which btw, all those vanilla servers you talk about (which use dynamic spawn) didn't have to deal with, because almost all of their initial population was dedicated.
---
Sure some might come with the mindset of "just wanna check out this other world", and they might wait a couple days, but what about those who want to give it a honest try, and then just quit cause they realise it is not actually for them.
---
And then let us not even talk about concurrency, which is during launch about 90% of the servers population wants to be online, while later on during normal operation its more like 30% (John Staats actually talked about that).
---
It unfortunately isn't. "What would you do in this situation" is allowed, but "I was playing on a private server and this happened" isn't, and is really better suited for r/wowservers. It's a fine line and I understand that's frustrating, but it's the line we've been towing for a couple years now to further differentiate from r/wowservers. Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
This summer
---
Ure a sucker. If you ruined your excitement of classic because u played private all god damn day then its your own fucking fault. Its like jerking to porn all day and then finally your girlfriend walks in horny but i get get it up anymore. Just shut up and move on. 
---
Yeah very true. Fun though
---
Got Amazon Prime? The Expanse is well worth a watch if you haven't seen it and you're in to sci-fi 
---
This is the correct answer.
---
I could replay classic 1,000 times and it'd be just as fun each time
---
&gt;don't think that a players first impression of vanilla should be a sharded Elwynn forest or whatever. 
---
A player who logs into Northrend to find every single mob dead &amp; 3-4 players competing for spawns is not fun. That's fine if you are trying to kill rock elementals in Badlands and you are competing with 60's farming their elemental earth, but new level 1's are not going to have fun because there are no alternative locations. Nobody cares if you are separated for a while so you can get your 10 Kobold kills because that's all people at this level care about. There is no strategy in the game at this point, it's the early part of the game where the objective is mostly about simply killing stuff with starter abilities.
---
You are one of the people who would have left after a few months and messed up our server pop...go play fortnite
---
LOL hell yea mate that’s what I wanna hear.
---
Some good ol autistic virgin nerd rage.
---
R/wow is gay
---
Past tense should not be used here.  It still FEELS EPIC!!! Yeahhhhhh
---
I played through all of vanilla &amp; all the way to 70 before I figured out keybinds &amp; assigning different functions to specific keys on my keyboard.
---
Its a 5 man dungeon.. you are 6...
---
Hackers!!!111
---
Ah yes salt will always be so real in situations like that but my god does it feel good to win the roll. 
---
The best year of our lives.
---
Runs off listening to baha men.
---
okay. thanks for explaining :)
---
The most efficient leveling scheme is questing. To get the most exp/hour, you need to be fighting the whole way to your quest and back to the turn in.
---
Weren't flasks around 90g each in Vanilla?
---
Most effective is a good mix between both, or in vanilla you will simply just run out of quests, or have to spend IRL time travel to another zone
---
The people who made old WoW said it was a mistake.

---
People can run player run tournaments and did on Nost with 3x  the number of concurrent players on a server who could grief it if Blizzard goes with 3k servers. If anything it makes the community stronger.

As far as big, entitled streamers? Play on a PVE server like Asmongold when you are WORKING and play on a PVP server in your private time, just like all your viewers who have jobs and don't want a tiny fraction of the playerbase effecting design and or ruining it. 100 million people have visited Azeroth and WoW's biggest sub counts were before streaming. They are only this important in their own minds and in the minds of many of their viewers who have never played a MMO with old school design because they died with TBC where too many instances replaced the world.
---
Want a failed esport that you want to waste your life being good at, which will make you less than a fast food employee if you become really good over the next decade? Play the modern game.
---
That being said...
---
Sent.
---
Oh good, another rogue vs rogue match.
---
Lol i think my first epic was the tier 1 bracers and belt from the guild bank :P
---
I used that frikin thing for so long loved that wep and the look of it was sick 
---
Nope, I play undead for the awesome animations and metal dance.
---
When I was by myself, Krol Blade.  I think I sold it for like 25g on the AH right before TBC came out.
---
Took me all of vanilla to get a BoE epic drop by myself. But out of my first 3 ZG Runs, I saw a tiger and a raptor drop...(didn't get either of them).
---
Kang the decapitator, from a Ravasaur in Un’goro. Think I sold it for 200g to a rogue who’s alt was gonna use it, and also he showed me how to stealth run to complete MC attunement. Good ol days. 
---
I never had an epic world drop, from vanilla to MoP :(
---
Staff of Jordan, dropped on my first char in vanilla ( around lvl 39 on a rouge) from the Bloodsail mobs in STV
---
Maybe you'll be just as excited if u stop thinking about it until it drops, like a surprise u might pick it up and play the shit out of it :) hope to see u in classic dude
---
Axe of the Deep Woods, got it killing Trogs in AV on my shaman.
---
With a good wand and a few select talents, each individual mob is a bit slower, but you can keep going and going. No drinking downtime.
---
Ridiculous design decisions that add nothing but down time for players, gonna be shocked if the tisms don’t start marching in full force for the right to sit down for extra seconds in a video game.
---
Yea I guess... although sharding &amp; loot sharing hit me hard. 
---
Part of why I lost interest is because I lost hope that they will limit sharding to starting zones only. I don’t wanna get my hopes up just to be hit with a brick. 
---
This is a 2h sword 
---
Seriously Wrath was easily the best iteration in a lot of ways, just the 10% bad shit that you mentioned was overwhelming. The world itself was superb, I loved how bosses and events from early dungeons played into final bosses in ICC, they really nailed the story telling across the whole expac.
---
I did not find much issue with Naxx, maybe too easy, but it was fun. I only saw the insides a couple of times in vanilla so I don't have a lot to compare it to. But from what I've read and seen it was fairly true to form, and 4H was vastly improved by not requiring 8-12 of a specific class, just people that can do the mechanics.
---
But yeah Ulduar was spectacular, absolute pinnacle of story telling and dungeoneering. Extremely fun bosses, lots of ways to do them, shaking up the meta with caster tanks etc, glorious.
---
Such a shame we never got the Azjul Nerub raid. ToC was fun but a terrible "tier" and made no sense.. the Lich King is nearly full power, we could go fight him.. or we could have a fucking fun tournament and fight these mobs we captured.. it could have been a fine opening tier to complement Naxx. I know it wasn't exactly planned to be main content, but it was just weird.
---
Man if we could get a version of WoW which had TBC and Wrath areas re-tuned for 40-60 and removal of tiers as we know it, make it "fire tier 0-3" and "frost tier 0-3" etc carrying on down the resist path instead of mass stat increase and then resets.
---
i so agree with this, it not the game necessarily, but the people you meet in it.
---
Funny. I feel that about the entire modern entertainment industry. Every movie coming out is crap. Most games outside like 4 companies who release a game every 4-5 years are crap and franchises are now so creatively bankrupt they try to make assembly line garbage look like politics so that they seem important (example Disney movies).
---
roughly 80% questing and 20% grinding all the way to 60
---
It's added in the av patch if I remember correctly so it'll be a while before you can get your mount.
---
When is Halo coming? :) :) 
---
This is the patch that added Cenarion Hold, which didn't exist in Silithus previously, along with Twilight hammer camps and the whole summoning mechanics. There may also have been some AQ-related quests included here (Into the Maw of Madness and/or The Calling) but I'm not sure about that; perhaps they were only added in the actual AQ patch.
---
Before that, Silithus only had Valor's Rest as neutral flight path right by the entrance (which was actually very useful because Un'goro didn't have an FP intiially). There was a quest chain there that had you kill ghosts in the ruined Southwind Village -- it was super annoying as killing a ghost would spawn a silithid that was difficult to deal with, and the area was rather densely packed to boot. Once you finished it, you got sent to Darnassus (or TB, I'm guessing) and the chain would end abruptly.
---
The only other notable spot was the elemental area to the northwest which was a good spot to farm Essence of Air (20-30g depending on the server) and Hydraxian Waterlords rep. There was also a sole NPC there that started the Thunderfury questline if you brought one of the bindings to him, and eventually summoned Thunderaan at the very end of the chain.
---
The rest of the area was mostly filled with three silithid hives and general emptiness. One interesting feature was that the original map of Silithus included space for Ahn'qiraj as its bottom half, which was permanently unexplored even if you got there via wallwalking. This was changed in 1.8 when the map has been cropped to only include the upper half; the patch notes you linked mention this.
---
I will enjoy it more for sure.
---
WoW died for me after Cataclysm for sure because many people from my guild just quit and so did i. I never got back that community feeling that we once had, never had that much fun than before.
---
Seeing that some of my old friends will start classic too i can't really wait for it, also back then everybody seemed to be more communicative, things just felt a lot better back then.
---
Another big reason is that in the last years there really were no good games that i could stick too very long. The consumer base has changed a lot in many games and i hope with playing classic i can have back what i missed for so long.
---
I dont think it ever will be a thing, but why not host 2v2 tournaments in STV arena ?
---
But i would probably pick Paladin with X.
---
What 
---
There is more epicness in the hard earned blues of classic than in the effortless epics if retail
---
I'm in the same boat man. I played the beta through the beginning of BC. I plan on just having a blast doing dungeons and roaming the world. i enjoy fishing and cooking said fish and just sitting around a cozy fire talking in chat. I'm currently also playing on a pserver so maybe we'll run into each other somewhere near the Echo Isles.
---
The thing about classic/vanilla is that, as a game, it doesn't push you into any specific way of playing. It doesn't tell you to level quickly, so you can get to the endgame. This legitimizes a more laid-back way of playing the game. It IS possible to get to level cap by playing entirely solo, but the bulk of the game exists before the level cap (this is especially true in the beginning and before a lot of endgame content got developed). There are tons of dungeons to do, and you have some choice in where to go, to level up. Questing content also includes quests you can't easily solo, as well as a few open world raid quests that can be done casually at level cap.  
---
It is the perfect casual MMORPG, because it allows you, and encourages you to enjoy the game at your own leisure. All of this 'rush to level cap so we can do raiding content' didn't exist throughout most of vanilla (in most of the population. There were a subset of players with this mentality). It's something that's evolved into the playerbase later on. Unfortunately, it seems that a larger part of the playerbase are all about the endgame now, than they used to be. Hopefully it doesn't prevent me from enjoying the game at my leisure.  
---
Paradoxically, I enjoy the leveling experience the most, but I also like leveling relatively quickly (not at all costs, but still).. I wish there was more content like leveling content, at level cap.
---
Who let the whelps out!? Who! Who who who!
---
are you sure about that? where do you take that numbers from. i feel its more like 60% grinding and 40% questing.
---
Most glows on weapons were added in later. Some people were pissed when Azuresong Mageblade started glowing because they thought it was so nice to have at least one weapon that looks somewhat normal. 
---
...
---
The point is there are no mounts available at 39, so class skill mobility is important.
---
When it's so much nostalgia you only now just noticed it's 6 party members in a 5 man dungeon.
---
Exactly the same here. I don’t want to go too deep into it but I feel like society in general slowly gets fed up with multimedial entertainment and tends to go/practice more “traditional” forms of entertainment like sports or hiking or literally whatever more than play video games or watch movies. 
---
Also im sure that delusional liberal politic mixed with into almost everything nowadays contributes to a decline of interest as well. 
---
Yeh mate that got to me to, I'm just hoping it won't be the end result, hopefully they will listen to the community screaming for the change. Anyways not trying to get my hopes up to high, it'll come when it's ready. And still if it's 98% of what it used to be I'll still play it for what it is, just try to get hyped about what's still authentic to vanilla and don't take it to hard the 2% they're changing. Hope that makes sense lol
---
Doesn't have to do with money issues.
---
If something weird happens maybe by accident even, you loose money you can't get it back. 
---
With the amount of credit card informations getting stolen by hackers you could be in trouble pretty quick.
---
Op should just ask blizzard for a refund. Asking doesn't cost anything. 
---
As someone who currently is the "bitch tank" I still have fun. If you like tanking being one of the off tanks is just as fun. 
---
They will be there, but good luck farming them. First you have to get to the zone, and then you have to FIND the one spawn in the entire zone. And assuming you find it you will have to divert any mobs within agro range long enough to  harvest it &amp; hope your first attempt does not fail. I can't see anyone successfully doing this until they are well into the 50's.
---
But why wouldn't either of you like just try to equip it and take it off first to find out if that's actually how it works? haha
---
Looks like the original T1 or T2 armour sets, the ones that looked horrible. Although I kinda thought the T2 warlock made you look like some kind of middle-eastern mystic trader, made me think of Abdul Alhazred who wrote the Necronomicon. 
---
Can confirm.
---
Only downside is the limited mana pool to get enough SP and you wear a lot of cloth.
---
That wouldn't work since lets say a server has a majority alliance or horde will still suffer from this issue.
---
If a server does not get too many tourists and out of the 10k only 1k leaves. you end up with a very overcrowded server.
---
Finally, if a server get like 2k people and 1k tourists leave. the server end up with in bad health anyway.
---
The solution to this ever since it became an issue is manually merging realms. Choosing 2 realms with low populations with each favoring one side and merge them to get stable medium server with balanced Horde/alliance ratio.
---
This was never adopted as a solution on retail because blizzard sold this service for money and instead chose to adopt shading technology which in my opinion, kills server community.
---
Nogg-aholic the movie has some vanilla footage of a rogue soloing the MC attunement with a lava walk.
---
True.
---
I just don’t trust them anymore &amp; already see it coming that they implement loot sharing &amp; won’t limit sharding in starting zones.
---
If one of those things happen I’m really not going to waste my already limited time on Classic :(
---
Whats the value of seeing so many people, do you think looking at 4 people trying to kill the same wolf as you is going to be a social experience? You are going to see that its tapped turn away and try another one.
---
No one is going to strike up a conversation with the guy that tapped the wolf before them, they are going to turn and try and tap another. Shard at the start and let people start the social bonds in Westfall.
---
i've powerleveled over 30 chars to 60 over the years, it soothes my mind 
---
those numbers come from joana's guide, still the fastest route ever recorded on official servers and is still used daily on private servers.
---
the idea in a nutshell is a very efficient route of mostly grind quests and some travel quests if they link up with your route, and you grind while traveling from quest to quest. some parts of the way you grind a full level or two simply because it is faster than travel-only quests when you temporarily run out of grind quests
---
Started jumping on pleb horse in Human starting location for more than 2minutes to try out mounting on him as others high levels had him. I was so dumb and it was a great impulse to start digging about everything in wow, teh result was outstanding Tidal Charm + engineering trolling in the end. Good old days &lt;3
---
Who agrees OP is an idiot lmaooo
---
Taran Icebreaker was my first epic world drop towards the very end of vanilla. I still have a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/yTEUWBk.jpg).
---
But before that (while not epic) I found a dark whelp pet. I wanted to farm it and got it literally on the first mob I killed. Also a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/994PYQi) here.
---
Gnomes were probably not in the game yet when they made this picture... 
---
I guess we'll just see then ;) u play on EU?
---
The real question is how populated they will be. 
---
As a guy who has played wow primarily for arena &amp; the epeen that follows i really agree with you. The sort of behavior that follows when competitive ranked pvp is introduced is best avoided for a game such as vanilla wow.
---
Don't remember the exact price of flasks in Vanilla, but they were stupidly expensive, around 150g. When BL was BoP, the flasks were 200g+. Dropped to 150g afterwards, and I think close to TBC they were like 90g.
---
In Classic, I expect 200g+ per flask for the first year.
---
I'm pretty sure there will be pugs for any raid except aq40 and naxx for multiple reasons. 
---
But the rest, yeah I'm pretty sure.
---
Naxx and aq40 seem easy from p-server perspective, which let's people underestimate how coordinated you need to be for certain fights.
---
Yea EU you too? Lets link up as soon as it launches, I’ll save your comment &amp; write you a DM on Reddit. 
---
So what about all the people playing optimal specs that are just bad. Should they quit? Or do they get a free pass just because they are playing the optimal specs?
---
yeah lotus farming is one of those things the first 60s will do before they have any competition
---
like devilsaur farming
---
I do because I underestimated the amount of incelism in this thread 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
---
For sure bro, haven't decided on faction yet but def playing pvp, hit me up and we'll settle on a cozy server 
---
I can't wait to have a persistent Realm, that isn't shrinked through flying, again without the X-Realm and sharding BS, or nostlike overpopulation for that matter. I will be enjoying this so much you can't even begin to imagine.
---
By your theory 20% xp by mobs and 5% by quest turn in. Which I would say your % on mobs is inflated. However Imagine you have groups of quests in the area.... you kill  and kill mobs to and from you get some 40%xp from all the mobs you killed some for the quest some because you had to (aggro along the way) .... then you come back and you turn in 4 quests (which took you a little travel time) but not nearly as much as killing all those mobs. 4 quests x 5% = 20% ... 20% for minimal effort since you were going to be killing mobs anyway.
---
Just thinking about those mounts causes salivation hnnng
---
Unless if you can abuse overpowered grind spots like pserver powerlevelers have(and we dont know whether those are as good in classic or not) then questing where you grind on the way between mobs is the most efficient method.
---
I hope there wont be arena in Classic because then I wouldnt do anything else apart from arena (judging by my game history from tbc to nowadays both on retail/private servers). Id prefer to play the original wow without arena this time (even though my greatest ingame passion is arena).
---
For theoreitcal 3v3 team composition in around t2/pvp gear, I think warrior/sl lock/holy pala would be the best (offensive, defensive dispells, mortal strike, freedom, HS for everyone, high constant dmg). Remember, mortal strike is a key in arena and only warr has it in classic. Rogues cant really apply wound poision (the poision itself is weak not % based and in the lack of shiv the rogue cant reliable slow without double crippling rng). Dispells are needed because of the long CCs in classic.
---
For burst, Id say warrior/hybrid ele sham/disc priest would be the best (mortal, windfury, offensive and defensive dispell, very high burst, mana burn if needed).
---
Ofc I wouldnt be suprised if RMP was also a thing...
---
It was all part of her plan 
---
People advocate for nochanges, and so you'll have to take the good with the bad. Now I'm not that self-deluded to think that twinks only want to face other twinks. The whole package includes non-twinks.
---
Anyway, low level battlegrounds make up for maybe 5% of someone's classic experience, if at all. You're making this issue a lot bigger than it is. Honestly, this sounds the same like if someone would be upset with world pvp and getting ganked by some 60. Maybe advocate for sharding next. Problem solved. 
---
And what about the fact that people in epics are unfairly matched against greens in the 60 bracket? And premades? Let's introduce gear score. Honestly, you can take it far with your type of suggestions.
---
You got me.  Shows how long it's been since I did that quest haha.
---
Oh yea I’m going Alliance since I’m rolling a pala. &amp; I thought about heading to a RP-PVP server bc I wanna miss all that min-maxing bs &amp; server firsts. 
---
RP-Servers tend to be a bit more relaxed while still going for raids &amp; all the good stuff. 
---
I’m not into role playing tho lol so just keep that in mind lol. 
---
what if tbc had only added the draenei and Belfs to the game, along with their areas in azeroth. and did not add flying/outland. would it be better IYO? also, same goes with wrath. we fight DKs in vanilla, but wouldn't it be cool to have that be a class within vanilla down the line eventually idk. I like the races they added in tbc and the dk(which i honestly have not played) from wotlk, but i love the gigantic world of azeroth and the places we go within it. and while i enjoyed the raids and the areas in tbc/wrath it does add more places to be, so we don't see the people we know as often. and it takes the feeling away.
---
Technically you where just a paladin until then :p
---
That's the real honest truth. There comes a time when you'll pretend you didn't just get that random chest drop with the superior stats because the one you're wearing kind of almost matches.
---
Lol the lag of fraps is to nostalgic, I wished I had screens or fraps from my vanilla days but unfortunately they're all gone, this is precious dude
---
I don't think the gameplay/systems/content will have aged well. I know I miss the feelings and emotions of that era of WoW more than I miss playing that version of the game.
---
Atmosphere is a huge thing for me in MMORPGs. I always enjoyed WoW because there would never be a moment where I didn't see other players, except for nights.
---
I remember how much interaction I had back in Vanilla, mostly because everyone was new to the game, but also because it was more exciting doing stuff together and often faster as well. Grouping up was common when doing quests that required killing X units.
---
Social interaction weighs more to me than fast leveling. That social interaction was present in Vanilla, but no so much in retail WoW, if at all. Only in guilds are you finding this interaction, which is a shame, because playing with others in the open world is what an MMORPG is all about.
---
Maybe you enjoy getting to 60 as fast as possible and min/max gameplay, but that's not what the majority of players do - or did, back in Vanilla. That kind of entitlement came with the newer expansions, where Blizzard had done everything in their power to remove social interaction, promote solo play and fill the game with catch-up mechanics. That's why I no longer play retail and why so many people are hyped for Classic WoW. We're going back to the long journey where we have time to interact with other players, instead of just minding our own business while traveling with portals, LFG/LFR and 310% flying mounts.
---
Arena sounds cool until you realize its just a handful of meta comps forced to play specifically like this with specific other classes and it's just about abusing those specific matchups. 
---
I won't lie. i loved the addition of Belfs/draenei. and the ghostlands/starting areas. but yeah i agree with flying mounts and stuff. even if the raids were lore heavy in tbc 
---
Questing is fastest. Most quests require you to grind mobs anyway, plus you get extra money, gear and rep.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm world record leveling speed is 90% questing
---
yeah i have a feeling i got scammed there, when thinking in hindsight
---
Honestly I don't think rogues would dominate 1v1 arenas. If you know they are coming they can usually be countered.
---
Ahh, it was close to TBC when I was buying flasks so that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Really want to raid and pvp with raid epics for some lulz. Hunter seems like an clear choice because of.. guilds will probably bring 2-4 meaning faster tier gear... also they actually have good tier sets. Hunters can get away with pvping as their raid spec. Hunters are kinda fun to DPS as and are a blast in pvp. 
---
Paladin? maybe? They will be easy to get a raid spot as... they are great as healers in pvp. I think I will be able to raid and pvp as the same spec. The problem is I won't be able to solo word content as much as a hunter. I may get sick of healing? 
---
Priest - I can;t afford to respec to shadow much. I would have to get some raid gear then commit to just pvp.
---
Anything I am missing?
---
But you're enjoying it aren't you ;)
---
Yeah people act like Vanilla content is particularly hard. The same people complaining about the filthy casuals are probably also the same people saying Blizzard should make the content more challenging by upping health totals and stuff.
---
Your voice and storytelling is relaxing to listen to but the personal stuff isn't something I'm to intrested in. 
---
Maybe I'll find your future videos more intresting. Keep up tho.
---
I was so salty about wrath that I didn't bother getting the box. I'm still on the fence as to whether I regret that or not. 
---
I thought wrath ruined the game then and I still do, but I had some really good times with it, too. 
---
&gt; People think the music from their teenage years was the 'golden age'.
---
That can't be true. Have you heard music in the last 25 years or so?
---
Don't have to be inside the dungeon though, the stairs leading up to the main hall outside SM has the same design :D
---
500g each? Sounds far fetched.
---
Yeah I was kinda into that to my my friend insists on playing on a normal pvp server since we're not really into the 100% RP, 10% is enough for me don't want to get crucified if my name is not RP enough, although I've never played on a RP so I might be wrong. Points ur making are interesting thou ill try to convince him lol
---
So you weren't a ret paladin, only a paladin
---
Not if they're in a PuG or casual guild that allows them in. Hardcore min/max guilds won't invite them in, and that's fine. As I said in a different child thread, I don't think most people playing sub-optimal specs are particularly concerned with being in a hardcore progression guild. PuG's and casual guilds will be fine for them.
---
I can understand being concerned about wasting the time of people with a hardcore progression mindset in a progression guild. But if you extend that to caring about "wasting the time" of people who... don't care if you play the optimal spec then it stops making sense. You're worrying about something that isn't an issue. And if someone in a PuG is that concerned about it, either they can start their own PuG and only allow optimal specs or join a progression guild. If they want to play casually then they will have to play with the casual crowd. That's their choice.
---
Let's also not pretend Vanilla content is particularly difficult. You don't even need 40 people for a lot of Molten Core. Some will want to be fully optimal and blow through the content, and that's fine. But others may want to take their time and play what they find fun.
---
I'll chime in here as well.  Even speaking as a person who genuinely enjoys competitive balanced gaming, Arenas were another step towards taking the "MMO" out of the MMORPG.
---
No, stop comparing what happens in retail to classic.
---
But it does suck for the fresh twinking community that got revived for a brief moment. Rip
---
What a silly post. You can buy manna biscuit from Argent Dawn you know.
---
No way they're going to sell for 500g+. Flasks were never that expensive.
---
added in Naxx patch IIRC those rewards were simply not there during MC, I am well aware of how private realms players do things.
---
YES!
---
Link would be very much appreciated :)
---
I still do this, despite the cooldown being significantly lowered.
---
Fishing and herbing make respectable amounts of cash, depending on the competition of course.
---
Honestly I hope there's no toggle simply because it causes imbalance in PVP. If you use the new water graphics it becomes easier to see players underwater, meaning it'll be pretty much required for anyone who wants to take pvp seriously. Which is a huge bummer because I plan on playing classic with the original graphics, but I'll be gimped for my choice in pvp. Doesn't seem very fair.
---
At least you were a paladin, the only class together with warrior to even benefit from it. And even for them it wasn't that good lol. It was my first one too, blasted lands. Sold it for 30 gold to a warrior xD 
---
Honestly after hearing some differences between pserv and classic... There won't be 35 min clear timers. They will clear fast but not 35 mins fast. To many things on the pserv are using best guess values and many debuffs don't stack correctly. It will be interesting to see when naxx releases how long it actually takes before someone gets the first KT kill.
---
If you call 1.2 late, then sure...
---
I bought a subscription and played retail for like a day all epic’d out.  Still felt like more of a badass at lvl 2 in mulgore killing plainstriders. Unsubscribed. 
---
You're welcome! I know the rules can seem arbitrary and frustrating sometimes, but we genuinely want r/ClassicWoW to be a good hub of discussion for Classic and try to be fair and transparent in our moderation.
---
I'm exclusively talking about just starting zones though. If sharding is the difference between not being super frustrated or getting to compete a little bit with some people around you I'd be fine with it.
---
2 weeks from the launch Northshire abby and all that will only have a few people in them at a time anyway so it will be just like the shards from the start. Do you think people who start classic 2 or 3 weeks or a month after when these zones dont have 5000 people in them will have a lessor experience?
---
They should release new expacs, but the level cap should stay 60. Put new leveling zones in the expacs instead of all 60+ content so alts have new things to do, and new players don't feel compelled to rush. NO FLYING EVER. Etc.
---
Speak for yourself, I gladly rocked the T0 rogue set.  Shamans probably have different viewpoints though.
---
...we don't have video games in our time.
---
There is no "World of Warcraft: Classic"
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Not gonna lie, for a 14 year old this ain't so bad, made me grin.
---
Yep.  On my first 60, NE hunter, I had 0 strategy and it took me forever to hit 60, but it was a blast.
---
My 2nd 60, that became my main, Human Rogue, I did exactly this.  If I was on a road, I was traveling only, if I was off road, I fought every mob that was near me or that I aggro'd while I quested.  I barely did any specific grinding outside of levels 58-60 in Winterspring, but I did grind A LOT because of this strategy.
---
When I hit 60 again, I'll most likely be grinding 58-60 in WS again.  It just seems to be a tradition with me. 
---
This sounds totally cliche, but I actually didnt buy any skills on my Rogue which didnt do any damage: Sap, Cheap Shot, Kidney Shot, Feint, ect. Until around lvl 30. As some of the those skill descriptions were very vague (german client) and I had no idea wtf those effects would be good for when all I wanted to do was killing my enemies.
---
Also ofc I usually didnt have enough gold to always buy all the abilities from the trainer, having constantly bought new white weapons from the vendors whenever available because they were better than the ones I had, so I had to decide which skills would benefit me more.
---
I didnt buy Vanish either because I didnt get the difference between that and the regular stealth which I already had (the tooltip didnt specifically state that its usable in combat, just that it puts you into a temporarily improved stealth mode, I figured it was common sense that this would only work out-of-combat as well).
---
There's places where there's no good reason *not* to do the quests. If you're going to go and grind mobs anyway you might as well pick up some quests and kill the right mobs. But there are certainly other ones that aren't worth doing whatsoever (usually they just involve travelling between 3 zones to talk to people).
---
However, some shitty looking travel quests open up to much better ones - and then there's dungeon quests which are almost always worth picking up.
---
It really depends on which quest you're talking about, but generally, you should pick a lot of them up.
---
I'm not against Blizzard doing something to mitigate the intial surge of players, be that sharding or something else. I just don't like the idea behind sharding. It may be a great tool for Blizzard, but it's horrible for the players and the atmosphere in WoW, which is why I think they should look into alternative solutions, such as server merging a few weeks into launch to stabilize populations. This would also help to maintain a healthy Horde:Alliance faction ratio.
---
its subjective but the PLAYERS collectively hail classic as the greatest, warts and all.
---
its why classic exploded on the pserver scene
---
it's why pservers for other xpacs never really did well
---
its why we are even getting Blizzard to do old Classic at all.... because there's such an insane amount of hype for The Original WoW
---
Yes, they should get a free pass, because there's nothing wrong with being bad, being bad on purpose is what there's something wrong with.
---
How can you not see how that's important distinction?
---
I remember I recreated my dwarf hunter twice because when I finally got a new weapon as well as equipping it I would drag the weapon onto my bar by replacing 'shoot'. I would then wonder why I couldn't press 1 anymore to shoot people thinking I'd broke it.
---
so now everyone in the raid that requires mana must travel to WPL or WPL pre-raid to stock up, and mages can sit laughing?&gt;  This is the exact implications I am talking about that very few people have even taken into consideration, and the very reason I started this topic.
---
I have been playing MAGE on vanilla realms for close to a decade including all of retail and beta.  I am reminding the "general playerbase" of an issue that many will not even have considered.
---
lol no way!  it's basically free extra money from any beast kills.  
---
you call that hardcore, you call that severe, the truth is, it was perfect. its what we all crave. you had to be aware of your situation. pull 2 mobs and you might die. ONE mob was tough.
---
No one likes joke levelling where you can chain pull tons of mobs or handle one easily.
---
Classic WAS the sweet spot
---
Loved that raid too. No muss, no fuss, just four boss fights at four separate raid tiers of difficulty. Do the ones you have on farm, then take a crack at the next one up until you get him too.
---
For fock sake dude...
---
i dont understand the reason for this post, are you just makeing a post to say you wont play anymore ?
---
We dont even know who you are, why would we care if you play or not ?
---
You sound like you don't make it out into public very often.
---
&gt;  feel we as a community should be encouraging all people to play how they have the most fun
---
Yes, of course, but not when them having fun is negatively impacting others.
---
&gt;I looked at the video and with potato resolution I have no idea what is going on and I am not sure how you think you do. He seems to have been on filming and offtank duty or something, and perhaps got told to save all his rage for the bugs at the end? I don't know.
---
The quality is clear enough that you can see which buttons he's pressing and how much rage he has. There are no adds during stage 2 that would need to be tanked. Any other ideas?
---
&gt;We need to know our own limitations. If you never played vanilla seriously and have absolutely no first-hand experience of even medium-level play, you have only been soaked in pirate server circlejerking about how great they are compared to real vanilla players, then you probably aren't entitled to an opinion.
---
How does knowing how basic class mechanics work, which items are the best at a given point in the game, and what buffs you can bring to raids constitute "pirate server circlejerking"? It's just hard facts about some of the game's most basic mechanics.
---
&gt;That's because evidence needs to be proportional to the claim. You can't say "all retail vanilla players were mouthbreathing incompetents" to someone who has actual first-hand experience of the game at the time, and knows you are wrong from direct experience, and "prove" it with one or two cherry-picked videos that you claim show someone playing badly.
---
I never said that all retail Vanilla players were bad. I'm just saying that I've never seen a single retail Vanilla video where the people are performing at the same level as good private server players.
---
&gt;Very little evidence from the time exists. And despite the hordes of people here who claim they were Naxx raiders in retail vanilla almost none of them seem to have any relevant memories. (Which would be puzzling if one did not already think they were mostly full of it.) But if your sample consists of one data point which is badly flawed, you don't really know.
---
That doesn't answer my question. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rUim7uPdPM) video confirms that you can do MC in 96 minutes even if your group composition is garbage (and includes 5 memespec DPS), people spec and play incorrectly and aren't fully buffed, your raidmembers die frequently (requiring more downtime between pulls) and the raid even manages to wipe.
---
With this in mind, how long do you think it would take to clear MC with an actually optimal raid group?
---
Its the guy that got tail swiped. 
---
The most upvoted comment here is the guy who admits to blowing smoke out his ass. Well done everyone
---
Well... technically vanilla has arena in form of gurubashi. Its just up to players to organise it rather than people queueing to it.
---
I was hopelessly addicted to WoW during TBC, for that reason alone I'll always be grateful that Wrath was as bad as it was.
---
I think Shaman would work real well in a comp. Totems are strong in PvP, Ele or Enh would work, pure resto would be pretty garbage.
---
SEND ME BACK! SEND ME BACK I TELL YOU!!!!
---
It's a difficult job to walk that balancingline if you introduce arena. I think it can work, but the second arena becomes an isolated game it really ruins the mmo feel.
---
Imo when it comes to MMORPGs the most important thing should be the world as a whole. To succeed in a MMO it should be a requirement to take part in every way the game offers, such as doing dungeons, raids, quests, professions etc. if you want the best of the best.
---
Being able to get the best gear by simply raiding or simply pvp'ing ruins the game for me.
---
I’d say it’s more like I’m completely detached from today’s gaming community since I’m outside pretty much all the time lol. 
---
I'd rather see an invite system. Players accounts who have posted on the classic wow forums get the first round along with players that have opted into the wow beta. Maybe a sign up system for round two consisting of those who haven't done either of those things. Then finally open the servers up to everyone.
---
Maybe 24-48 hours between groups. 
---
People would die in 1-2 fears,sheeps.stack mage,lock/rogue + heal. Neverending cc right there.
---
Skullflame shield. Sold that badboy for around 500g :D
---
That's how I did it :D
---
(((goblins)))?
---
&gt; Not if they're in a PuG
---
Because a pug has the luxury of turning down a nelf priest or a tank who didn't pick engineering?
---
&gt; Let's also not pretend Vanilla content is particularly difficult.
---
Lets not pretend 5 miles is far, but that doesn't mean it's not more pleasant on a bicycle than on foot.
---
I would also argue that it took the rpg out of the game too. Instead of playing a class you identify with you feel more pigeonholed into playing a class performs in arena. For me it wasn't just that, the group of guys I played with in vanilla didn't make up a great comp in arena, we didn't do too badly in there but it was hard to overcome comps that fit the meta. 
---
Good idea..... Until it turns into a moshpit
---
Dont forgot wc3. I hope it releases before classic.
---
Do we know if spell batching will be in classic? It wasn't in the demo but afaik it hasn't been confirmed or denied.
---
Reading posts from more clever people than myself it seems it can't be added back in it seems.
---
Selling the gear/trash from farming pre-raid BiS lol
---
I think it greatly depending on the server. I vaguely remember FoT going for around 75-100g regularly. People just didn't use flasks as much in vanilla until nax/aq. 
---
You're just arguing to argue now. You're not even addressing the core point. If you want to be hardcore there are hardcore guilds out there for you. If you want to be casual there are casual guilds and PuG's for you. Getting mad on behalf of people who don't care themselves because people in suboptimal specs exist does no one any good.
---
I think they were saying that it dropped off a mob outside black rock mountain.
---
RMP would faceroll every comb because there is no resilence
---
If it can’t be added back in, mages are being nerfed quite a lot especially in PvP. Also rogues get hit pretty hard as well.
---
We are talkin about the top 100 teams then, yeah.
---
I'm just in it for some fun with some friends.  You'll have plenty of pre made AB's and WSG's this time around with maxed out strats anyway :) 
---
Thats a minus 50 dkp.
---
Just to defend the tournament lore wise.  I do agree they don't make the point clear enough but it's purpose was to find the best group of heroes to take on the Lich King because just throwing armies at him would have make him stronger by raising anyone who fell.  Originally it was planned to have the tournament in crystal song forest (not in icecrown, basically at the foot of icc) but the lag of Dalaran made that impossible.
---
NO, god NO! Just NO!
---
On a scale from 1 to even, I can't!
---
Gnomes were in the game since the start weren't they?
---
I distinctly remember my first character being a gnome warrior, but I was pretty young so it might not have been at release
---
KFC (Hunter/Warrior/Hpal) would absolutely dominate. Insane control, defense, and damage. Also it would counter any team that uses Mana, as well as obliterate rogue teams.
---
Same. You get all of the glory of being the MT without the no-life necessary to remain the MT.
---
Shatter combos are implementable without spellbatching. Just as gouging blink would be. General authentic spellbatching isn't a thing on current private servers. So I'm not sure why people don't scream at them to correctly implement it. 
---
I guess people are fine with the "good" parts of it working and don't want to have tanks die while heals arrived in the same batch.
---
Yes and yes. 
---
Not sure if you are serious about MC being beast. Dont think I ever wiped in MC to be honest except early Vanilla. 
---
Mechanics are very easy, the ”hardest” is probably Living bomb debuff and people not noticing it. 
---
As long as RL calls out banish and ”everyone hug” its simple. 
---
My understanding is that shatter combos relied on the fact that crit chance was calculated at the end of the cast, not when the spell hit the target. So because you’re casting ice lance before your frost bolt hits the target and removes the freeze you get the increased crit benefit. 
---
If that mechanic is the same in classic then it should work regardless of spell batching. 
---
Interesting read. Depends on the definition of a mistake though... Still was a lot of fun even if people found the best strats after a while. 
---
Im not talking about making it an esport, because it never will be. Just an idea for a new BG.
---
Jesus I have no idea why you are making such a big drama out of this because I certainly wasnt. I was simply trying to bring a piece of information to the table that some people may not have considered.  A mage is now a MUCH less attractive gold farming class until DM is released simply because they are spending about 50% longer drinking.
---
I am talking from experience as a mage, both on retail nearly 15 years ago, during beta and from playing on private realms for years.  The great Nost didnt stagger the release of dire maul, and every realm in the private scene since, and as such a LARGE portion of the community has either forgotten, never played that way before or have a screwed experience on private realms.  
---
I am trying to open discussion not have a damn argument.  I said in the original post this is to start debate, what you are looking for is an argument and I have given my opinion.

I hope this is how it works 
---
My first epic was a Gut Ripper (dagger) that a guildie gave me when I got to 40. A few days later, another one dropped from the pirates in Tanaris. I probably should have sold it, but I the thought of dual wielding epics at level ~44 was too good to pass up.
---
Hot take you got there
---
Ah ok. So your saying you like 39 because things like travel form, ghost wolf, and sprint are more impactful. Makes sense. I was genuinely curious.
---
We don't have a leg to stand on. Our persuasion power is drawn from if something was not in vanilla and is being considered to be out in. These are all fair game. 
---
I blame Executus.
---
It will be interesting to see if this works favourably for any other classes/specs
---
Private servers have different spawn rates than classic had/has. Mainly in place thanks to the 1 server and way bigger population as was originally in classic.
---
In classic the BL spawns are 2 hours i think instead of the 30 minutes in most private servers.
---
 I totally agree. I cleared Naxx, Sartharion, Malygos in like 2 days after launch on 25-man. WotLK was a huge joke from the start. Ulduar Hardmodes were the only real challenge in the entire expansion (ICC was pretty good too).
---
I will enjoy it more, because I did everything I wanted in vanilla. So I can just chill and play for fun! :) We're a group of people who's gonna play on a RP-PvP realm and just have fun!
---
I *am* addressing the core point, it's the rest of you who keep pretending the core point isn't the core point.
---
The core point is, this sub is filled with people trying to encourage others to actively troll others by intentionally performing poorly, which negatively impacts every single person they'll ever group with.
---
It's how it should be! :) But if people liked the new animations and models who not let them. It's just cosmetic and nothing other players will see.
---
Naxx at 70 was harder than new Naxx at 80.
---
But yeah it might hurt Shatter combos, if you meet someone fast on dispelling and what not.
---
No deathcoil vanish, or stun at the same time they get a fear. It is going to be intressting as lock vs rouge. Maybe we are not getting countered that hard outside of SL specc anymore.
---
I think you're thinking of pre-1.4 level 60 mounts.
---
When was I defending sharding?
---
Warrior and Paladin would be quite hard. Rogue + Druid would be strong as well.
---
How does one get this salty?
---
I am looking for an Oceania, Normal (PvE) server, Alliance, raiding guild. I am an American living in Japan, which is two hours behind Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT). I intend to play a Warrior and would like to raid again like the good ole days. I leveled up a Warrior alt to 60 back in the day and it was some most fun I have had with the game. I was 16 years old when WoW Classic originally came out and I haven’t had such a great, close-knit, bonding experience with friends in any game I have played since then up through Wrath of the Lich King. 
---
As for experience in Classic WoW, I raided MC, Onyxia, ZG, and BWL. I mainly raided as a priest back then. I stopped playing retail WoW at the beginning of MoP and only raided a little bit in Cataclysm. Although I have a “life” and a family these days, I look forward to being able to relive WoW Classic anew.
---
You're unreasonable to suggest that people choosing to play the spec they want to play, among people who are fine with being suboptimal, are negatively impacting everyone.
---
You're the definition of the elitist prick that no one enjoys playing with, and I don't think it's an issue if people like you are pushed out of this sub.
---
I'm going to play a warrior using the optimal setup because I want to. But I don't give a shit if someone decides to go play a ret pally, or an enhance shaman, or whatever. Frankly, I don't take a 15 year old video game that seriously. I hope you find the community you're looking for.
---
I played rogue and didn't have any problem at all in duels. Only disliked the damn hunters that stood AFK on freeze traps + flare.
---
Icebreaker that stupid useless 2handed mace. I think its one if the worce epic drops.
---
That's correct matey yeah 
---
I stand by my opinion that this is a silly pointless thread. Mages can still make free water and if you want the 4410 mana kind you can buy it from a Vendor.
---
If you think they are going to sell for 500g you're delusional. There won't even be that much gold in the economy by that point. This isn't worth your time.
---
No I remember it being terrible. Far too fast for a 2 Hander and the proc on it was shit as well. I was so excited too 
---
ice lance wasn't in vanilla
---
I made good money in AH selling superior items because I didn’t like the look lol
---
What about the beginning was amazing? Ulduar &amp; ICC are regarded as two of the best raids in the entire game, both of which were middle/end of expansion raids respectively. 
---
What was good about naxx 2.0? I would call it one of the worst raids of all time tbh. It was totally gimped.
---
Admittedly the quality nosedived with the argent tournament, which from memory was when things like gearscore started to become the norm too?
---
Jesus man calm your tits.
---
You are exactly the type of person they talked about when they mentioned "pvp heroes". Believe it or not people do play games to have fun sometimes.
---
Some of the best pvp videos of all time were just fighting people because they were there.

Bye felicia
---
I still had fun in Halaa. Flying mounts just got rid of griefing and ganking for the most part. Organized World PvP was still a thing.

They were typically around 80g each, however they weren't frequently on the AH. Allakzham has some archived AH prices for the flasks.

Fiery War Axe from one of the bears in Feralas. Was pretty young, so was stupid enough to use it instead of selling it, not knowing that Whirlwind Axe was even a thing.
---
Blizzard has mentioned updated models in a fee interviews as something they might do. But they have not confirmed anything and it was not possible to use the updated models in the Classic demo at BlizzCon, although there were other modern graphics options available.
---
True but the same applies to whatever instant cast you’re using. 
---
for a very long time hoj dropped off generel angerforge not the emperor, I recall running him dozens of times to get melee the trinket.
---
I distinctly remember yelling "Aaah how the tables have turned!" As I ran after a shadow-priest or Warlock. Where is your mana burn god now?!
---
I wonder how they will manage this and predict numbers of players. I really don't want to roll on a server and 5 months later it's dead.
---
Which one , the six tiers of content or am I missing a new one
---
At some point early in vanilla none of the mobs in silithus dropped anything.  With silithus being the only zone that has high level air elementals that meant the only way to get essence of air was through transmutes.
---
Hoping for a toggle. Ive enjoyed playing on pservers using the new models. However, i hate the new animations.
---
Updated models, updayedterrain textures, and old combat animation would be perfect for me.
---
No, because it's not new. Therefore I expect I'll be able to not play for a while easily as well. However, on the other side of the coin. It still is the best game ever made. (which is very painful for the current gaming industry) So when I feel like gaming I always know that I'm playing a true masterpiece.
---
Wow you completely missed my point, I'm saying if you're so keen on fetishising all the inconveniences then why don't we get blizzard to implement artificial queues just for that classic experience? I'm sure they can design servers to handle as many players as they need these days.
---
Honestly the starting zones at release were such a small small part of the vanilla wow experience it should really be left for those who actually experienced 15 years ago, an artificial version of it will not be the same and will leave most people playing the game annoyed and frustrated. 
---
Lol as long as you skin them and don’t let me find them unskinnable! 
---
I also mean about the community aspect. Back then is was an epic moment doing dungeons with your buddies.
---
Iconic rogue gear during vanilla. Especially after world of roguecraft videos 
---
I don't think so. Being brand new to a game, first mmo &amp; being 13 years old will never be the same as being older, very busy and knowing too much.  I'll love it and I'm super pumped but definitely have my expectations in check.  
---
The 29 bracket isnt about weapons, it, like the 19 BG relies heavily on enchants to get an unrealistically high amount of stats that enormously buff your damage, much less so than your weapons. Druids benefit a lot more from just base stats.  Additionally, you want to go 17 into Feral for imp backstab. I just went 0/20/0 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxMGsbb](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxMGsbb)
---
Blood Frenzy procs all the time due to having such high crit at that level. Youll annihilate casters and healers with your speed and 1.0 attack speed. Healers you dont even need to bash, if you just save a bit of energy for when they heal, you can usually burst them down with a backstab evis. Melee you can often go toe-to-toe against, Warriors are still pretty bad at that stage and Shaman have very low DPS since they dont even get WF yet. A well geared Rogue with Crusader enchants and such might give you trouble in Cat Form, but you can do the standard Feral play and beat him down in Bear Form, Bash+heal combo.
---
29 is a bit odd that it kind of breaks youre normal perception of Druid PvP in that youll be in Cat form 90% of the time killing people. Bear Form is strictly used for when youre being targetted down or facing a tough Rogue, multiple melee or for Charge/Bash.
---
You certainly lose out on Nature's Grasp as a flag runner, but, since you outrun most classes so badly it doesnt matter nearly as much at 29.
---
Flash of Light is paladin, Flash heal is priest.
---
I mean it still is. You, your friends dawning awesome looking gear taking on the world, building a guild. Sounds epic to me.
---
This dropped during the initial zerg at the start of AV for me taking a graveyard or something. Remember winning a need roll after nearly 40 people rolled need too haha 
---
Join the club there's 3 of us in this thread alone! 
---
&gt;if you start a server with 3000 pop, and 50% of that is tourists
---
Then start the server with 6k population? Why is that so difficult? Did Nostalrius die or lack any success because it had 10k pop and no sharding?
---
The only real issue here is allegedly crowding and difficulty doing quests and tagging mobs. What an intolerable challenge unique to a fresh server. 
---
Perhaps there is another issue Activision Blizzard aren't being honest about: they don't want to or can't provide the infrastructure to handle as many simultaneous players as Nost did?
---
Either way it's still not a legitimate excuse.
---
If they're concerned about losing 50% of the population to tourists, and they want ~2.5k population servers, then they can simply start with 5k pop servers. **That is what they will do anyway,** the whole point is that they should do it **without sharding.**
---
There have been dozens of Vanilla servers at this point, *including every single retail Vanilla server ever,* and *none of them were sharded.* Yes, some ADHD instant gratification zoomers complained on the forums, just like players complain about anything on the forums. But people still played, and the furor died off after a few days. People survived. The servers survived. Everything was fine.
---
You think the modern gamer can't handle the challenge of a fresh server environment?
---
&gt; I've put together a Google Doc of my plans characters/name claims, levelling routes, gear to get, step by step guides to levelling professions, key quests that I need to get before dungeons, even quests to get that give good gear/bags.

Can’t remember a single time hiding in water was ever a factor in PvP tbh.

Gods I was strong then

I would honestly never buy food or water for a raid. That’s crazy talk. 
---
I always hit 60 with the Winterspring yeti or the Eastern Plagueland undead in the ghost town.

If you didn’t care one way or another you wouldn’t be on this Reddit.

My first toon was a night elf hunter druid. Got to around lvl 10 on Teldrassil.   
---
When i tried to get to the harbor i felt of the tree and died on the the way down. My corpse landed so i couldnt reach with my wisp. Spend a couple of hours to get to the corpse without any luck.. I didnt know you could ress at the graveyard, so i made a new toon..   
---
Never doing that again 
---
&gt; What other solutions do you have?
---
Increase the initial server cap by 15-25% to mitigate the eventual future loss? That's what they're going to do anyway? What did you think they were going to do?
---
The only difference is they will be *sharding*. They simply don't need to shard. It's a disingenuine argument, a bait and switch, and people are easily falling for it.
---
The issue is the sharding, which has no purpose other than to save intolerant players from the challenge and difficulty of a fresh server competitive environment.
---
Then don't buy food or water for a raid. Mages can make perfectly fine and free water and food before Dire Maul is out.
---
Here you go friend!

[https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Dungeon\_Set\_2](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Dungeon_Set_2)
---
No, thank you. That is part of Vanilla. Meeting random people and teaming up for a quest and doing it until ALL members had what they needed. That's how I met so many people. If you want loot sharing, stick to retail.
---
Every single one of the hundreds of Vanilla servers, including *every single retail Vanilla server,* was launched with a competitive environment. Did the fresh server challenge kill those servers? Did it kill WoW? Did it kill Nost? Or were players able to handle having to group up to tag mobs or spread out to find new areas, come up with new solutions?
---
People are acting like this is the first time a fresh Vanilla server has ever been launched. *It is always competitive and hectic during the first few days of launch.*

The etc was for any other dots. I played warlock through Naxx so I'm not unaware of the situation.

---
It’s the 1 hander that glows purple
---
This is pretty bad. I was a hunter and I was training new skills, but they appeared in your spell book instead of on bar.
---
I opened my spellbook to click abilities in combat not knowing I could drag them to the action bar until level 8. It wasn't a long time, but it was long enough to face palm in shame.
---
You obviously didn't play in vanilla 
---
&gt; What I think they'll do is use sharding in order to create servers within servers for a period of time so that a server instead can hold 5k, 10k or whatever number they deem fit. After the tourists leave they can then turn off the sharding and be left with healthy populated servers with the authentic #nochanges cap in place.
---
So you think that 5k or 10k players will never leave the starting zones?
---
If they do, then it won't be authentic once they leave, right? It'll basically be a +5k pop server until the "tourists" quit, right?
---
”Clearing MC in 35 minutes” oh boy, some people are actually delusional 😂
---
Aside from flying mounts was there anything that TBC added that you absolutely hated?

*Unacceptable!* You want to do your quest *now!* How could you possibly tolerate having difficulty tagging mobs or not being able to do the quest *you* want to do *now?!*

The only solution is to shard the zone.

This

Yes they were available at launch. However, he means during the game's development. This is a real old photo and was probably taken before they designed gnomes
---
Makes sense tbh
---
Boots of avoidance from a trash mob in sunken temple, won the roll against all other 4 party members. Sold it and it bought me the mats for my final black dragonscale piece + 2x Dawn's edges.
---
Ofc you can skin them, there’s no trainer in the starting zone though. 
---
I dont think its that far-fetched, there are way too many min-maxers who will enjoy the game (Despite the rhetoric most people in this sub promote), that will be able to farm the most-efficient guaranteed gold methods, this will increase the gold supply and the prices of all goods will rise because of hyper-inflation.
---
Vanilla databases have elixirs costing around 100-150G, however there was not much data on it as elixirs were not used as frequently and definitely were not sold as frequently, expecting the price to sell for x3-x5 is just an educated guess, but I might be way off TBH.
---
You're part of a large club don't feel too bad lol
---
Running into twinks or groups of twinks was just part of life in Vanilla. Do like the rest of us. Get salty for a moment, deal with the fact that it just is, get over it and move on to the next one.
---
&gt;The only reason people want it is because they've been spoiled and in 2019 people can't understand not getting everything they want day 1.
---
This. No other argument holds water. The *but muh tourists* argument is completely invalid. You think the tourists are only going to stay in the starter zones? What happens when 2 hours pass and they've left the starter zone?
---
Then fresh server congestion, mob tagging challenges, difficulty getting quest items, then all that is suddenly acceptable?
---
👍🏼👍🏼. Wanted to make sure my run to org was worth it to skin those mobs. Ty
---
I was a Naxx raider in Vanilla, buddy. You obviously didn't play TBC. See I can gatekeep just like you!
---
Doesn't really matter, you can still just collect everything you need.  Put aside 353g (or it maybe 354) for the quest fees, then collect 6 arcanite bars, 20 mana biscuits, 60 runecloth, 10 arthas tears, 5 strat holy water, and then just sit on it knowing you can do your quest in an hour or two with a couple dungeon runs once it IS in game.
---
So, back in the day, you never had a problem getting into a guild as a warlock. It just wasn't an issue. Warlock was *by far* the least played class on most of the servers I was on. Mainly because:
---
*  Early in WoW, they weren't great at PvP.
---
*  For vanilla, they had a high skill floor. They had a ton of buttons in an age when the majority of players clicked their abilities. They also required pet micro and dot monitoring, and most of the mods to help sucked.
---
*  In PvE, they were seen as shitty mages that only brought utility and nothing else.
---
Yet, of course, because of that utility (and because no one else played one), you'd have people inviting you to their raiding guild before you hit 60. That's what happened to me, at least.
---
Yet, as time went on, buffs + knowledge changed the game for warlocks. People learned to play them in PvP + they received buffs that turned them from worst to one of the best. Destro locks could melt you, and SL locks could outlast anything -- they were one of the few classes that could tank through high-end rogues/warriors like it was nothing.
---
In PvE, they scaled well and became respectable -- not quite hitting top DPS numbers, but doing enough where they were competitive. Plus, they still brought a ton of utility.
---
People also learned that they were good at farming, that they were one of the best characters for getting shit done in the world (as you didn't have to worry about being ganked if you were SL), and that they just overall were not the shitty class people thought they were at launch.
---
Yet, they still held onto their low population, basically until the end of TBC.
---
Warlocks are one of the best all-around classes, but I suspect after over a decade, the secrets out, and the class won't be the least played by a mile.
---
[This shitty mace](http://classicdb.ch/?item=868) dropped when I was in Feralas and some BS went down. 
---
So, I met this other rogue a few days before questing and we helped each other out, I think it was an elite quest and since we were both there we decided to do it together and hit it off. So, he comes online one day when I'm questing in Feralas and I send him a whisper, "hey, I'm in Fererlas, wanna come quest with me?" "Sure, I'll head there now," he says. 
---
So he's flying down and I just start killing mobs around Camp Mojache and BAM, it drops. My jaw drops, my heart skips a beat and I roll need...and so does he, despite flying over the barrens, and I was PISSED. Sure, it was a shitty mace, but I was broke and could've used the gold. 
---
They put in the mechanic a few patches later where you had to participate in the kill in order to roll on it, and all I could think of was this. 
---
500g each is probably way too much since they will most likely be BoP for a few months atleast meaning a lot of People will have time to hit 60 and farm them themselves
---

I must have levelled like 10 char on differents server and never saw one. I hope it will be different in classic
---
There were big 5v5 communities/events on Illidan and Blackrock for retail vanilla (probably some other servers).
---
The best comps evolved with the patch cycle/gear level.
---
In the early patches by far the best 5vs5 comp was war/rogue/mage/hpal/priest.
---
Rogues with thistle tea could all but guarantee a kill in your opener.
---
We had a running offer for any 5vs5 match (in gurubashi), losers leave the server.
---
No one took us up on it, but one guild did agree to wager 1000g on a 5vs5 match with us.  
---
They said they knew they were going to lose but had to defend the honor of the horde.
---
Later patches 1.10+, gear had gotten to the point where you could be successful with some more varied comps.
---
We used to do in house 5vs5 in Dire Maul arena after raids at this point in the server cycle to practice for the server-wide roaming 5vs5 events.
---
Horde side double warrior with 80+ dps 2Hs and windfury could do some work if you didn't have a mage to lock them down.
---
Hunter damage was really high at this point too if left unchecked, in fact the state of hunters in late vanilla is what led my team and &lt;Power Trip/Team Pandemic&gt; to run a hunter in our 5vs5 comp for the start of TBC.
---
Oh thank goodness lol 
---
I'm not certain on the exact numbers, but in my experience the best way is following the quest line and weaving in some grinding here and there.   
---
So you know, kill mobs on the way to the quest objective - kill a few extra quest mobs instead of spending a long time running past them while avoiding combat, maybe skip a few quests that are too far out of the way (unless they are fun / have good rewards) - and then maybe grinding for half a level here and there to get high enough for the next zone. 
---
I know this is very unspecific, but it's just to say that you can level fairly efficiently and play the game in a fun and engaging way at the same time. 
---
A big part of it too, is using your abilities efficiently. If you go OOM every mob, and need to drink up inbetween, you're gonna be way slower than someone optimising spell use - whether you grind or quest. 
---
Not having sharding would probably fuck any potebtial there is for attracting new players on launch. 
---
A true classic indeed still gets transmogged
---
I remember it was late at night and we wiped one time in wintergrasp and our guild leader said “alright everybody. Now that we’re done walking out dogs, let’s actually take them down.” And we went on and beat them easily. It’s little memories like that from WoW that you just don’t get from other games in my opinion. 
---
how about half that time  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxdbQ2mgUfQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxdbQ2mgUfQ) 
---
I have been in guilds that have cleared MC within the first three resets, with buff stacking MC is a complete joke for a competent and organised guild with 40 warm bodies.
---
Yeah definitely, i am not talking about selling the BL right away, but during 1.3+1.4 or 1.5+1.6, you could definitely sell them for as much as possible. It's mostly an investment if you really hated other gold farming methods/dont have as much time to play vanilla, but will play during launch.
---
As for the 500g, I know it is ridiculous, but because of the low barriers to accessing vanilla, I believe there will be an insane amount of bots, that in conjunction with people farming raw gold in instances leads me to believe that it will sell for 500g+.
---
Mind you 500g+ will NOT mean the same thing because if there is that much gold in the economy the price of ALL goods will increase. This will definitely hurt casual players, but I doubt anything will be done about it.
---
Thank you! Going to look through this now.
---
Paladin war would destroy anyone
---
Ah right, I didn't realise the picture was taken during development
---
It’s true though 
---
"Organized world PvP" Maybe your server was different, but this did not exist in any shape or form on mine in TBC. Going to a specific place in the world to PvP, like Halaa, is not world PvP, might as well just goto a BG. Greifing in world PvP is sometimes what lead to 2 huge guilds going at it in the middle of a random area of the world, it was fun. Once there was flying mounts, this did not exist. 
---
I just don't understand people that want to cruise into WSG at 11 and expect it to work against lvl 19s, regardless of gear. IMO, just shrink each bracket. 10-14, 15-19, ect. You still get twinks, but not as bad.
---
Getting lost in Stormwind. Happened quite a bit for a couple of months before i realized the roofs were color coded and roughly where they were. Hell, I never really used the map command until a while later.
---
I had successfully been ignoring Classic for the most part for a couple months now.  Still somewhat excited for it, but not really thinking about it often (mostly when raid was going especially poorly on live and i was looking forward to ditching my pants-on-head guild).
---
Yep, thats changed since the post.  F5ing new on this sub, even.  Dammit D:
---
Hand of Edward the Odd. Used it for a long time on my holy paladin. The original proc was a chance on hit to let your next spell be instant cast. It was insanely broken in PvP
---
You must main a combat rogue because you’re so edgy.
---
Link the docs? Always interested to see stuff like that
---
Every dungeon except Dire Maul could actually be done with up to 10 people for most of Vanilla. They only changed the cap to 5 players in patch 1.10 or something if I recall. It was after AQ.
---
don’t listen to the edgelords. They’re not *that* bad, but still below the other healers due to heavy reliance on HoTs.
---
Druid is much more of a hybrid in Vanilla than any other expansion. No matter the spec, you will end up doing a little bit of everything. If you’d rather play healer only, i suggest going for something else.
---
There was no weather effects active in the demo zones, so likely this part was not ready. I sure hope it will resemble how it was in Vanilla very closely as you describe it.
---
Boy that's the truth
---
I just realized that is the exact same thing that's happened with me.
---
Was in the back of my mind for the past few months, but now I'm here every day.
---
I must have more info.
---
Same, i keep checking back here hoping to catch something new, hoping my new zandalari can hold off the shakes a couple more months 
---
Your right... Im going to go now with my shame.
---
Exactly my point, what if I go back to aggramar and in a few months there aren't even enough 60s to be running 40 man's 
---
Every duneon except Dire Maul was 10man for most of Vanilla.
---
Hammer of the Northern Wind from somewhere in EPL. This was a few months into TBC, needless to say I was devastated when I discovered how worthless it was.
---
I did this too with herbs. Someone told me herbalism was good for making gold, but I didn't realize that was via the AH and vendored them all until at least level 40ish.
---
Resto is a perfectly viable spec. 
---
Can't levitate others players. same with Mages Slow Fall.
---
Yeah, certainly. I think people should listen to the old podcasts for the exact purpose you said: museum pieces. It's at least more interesting than current vanilla content.
---
Whether or not there's going to be any interesting content for these guys to talk about once the game is out...I'm semi-skeptical. 
---
"Hey guys, ZG is out, let's talk about ZG, even though we've already talked about ZG for many hours in previous videos."
---
dude, I have fought good rogues who found a way to survive without stuns.
---
500g is way too much. You have to remember what the flask actually does. It gives you a two hour buff. 500g is a LOT of gold, and nobody is going to spend that kind of gold on a 2 hour buff just to raid when the raid can be cleared anyway.
---
MAYBE a guild wold come together and get a flask for their tank, but in that case the demand will be too low and the flask wont sell for 500g in the first place.
---
I heard priests are best but I don’t want to pot a priest unless it’s disc and I remember that being more pvp oriented when I played in wotlk. (Might have just been what my 13 yo mind saw though). What would you rank for healers/specs?
---
I'm very much looking forward to my group being wiped by hunter pets body pulling a ton of shit because people are so used to the aggro radius reduction in retail that is non existent in vanilla. PSA to all Hunters: Please dismiss your pet when a group is attempting to move through a tight area to avoid pulling trash, or if you ever think that it will be a close call. TYTY
---
I have no idea how they are actually going to implement it but they seem very aware that it's both a starting zone problem and a tourist problem and that sharding in some form will allow them to handle both of those problems. 
---
I would advise to watch the Kargoz video's on youtube. He's got a couple on hunters and they're pretty awesome. I'll be playing hunter myself. And even though I'm not going to Min / Max the shit out of my hunter, the Kargoz video's gave a great inside into mastering the class. Which will help me find my own path without being shit.
---
Damn, now Classic is ruined.
---
/s
---
I understand that sharding is the solution to the lunch problem that really can't be fixed. 
---
But is lunch problem really a problem? It's true that during this time, the game can't be played the way it was intended to be played... but the lunch period is an interesting and unique period on it's own and it won't that long. This problem really doens't require solution at all. As for those that can't play in such environment, they should simply start a month later.
---
In actual vanilla on taren icebreaker.  In pserver my toon (Tauren warrior Jimihendrix) was ridiculously lucky and I got ardent custodian, hurricane, 2xprecisely calibrated broomstick, 3x typhoon, freezing band, skull flame shield, stockade pouldrans, and ironfoe(not boe but still rare, took hundreds of runs for that one tho)
---
Honesty think I’m forgetting some too.
---
Well, it totally existed on my server. I guess we had different experiences. There was no need to try to invalid my claims by attempting to gatekeep me. 
---
I don't understand how Halaa wasn't World PvP though. There were rewards for PvPing there, but it was essentially just a place in Nagrand. It was a nice way to initiate World PvP on a larger scale. Even the three towers in Hellfire Peninsula worked as a nice catalyst for World PvP.
---
I prefer it mismatched though, every plate item in Wrath looked exactly the same until you got epics, essentially. 
---
You really should research before being extremely aggressive.

Ulduar was the second raid out of 5 in WOTLK, no where near “final patch”.

---
&gt; No launch of any Vanilla server ever had sharding in starting zones.
---
True, but here are a few things that the Vanilla launch DID have:
---
* Huge login queues that infuriated the player base
---
* Servers crashing from player load
---
* Dead servers as short-time players moved on
---
Of course it will work. No private servers had accurate spellbatching and almost all the important things were easily done. I gouged every blink from bad mages on Nost. I vanished deathcoils. I played Warrior past that but no rogues or mages (the usual people worried about spellbatching) complain about anything post Nost outside the usually complaints. Mages cry about Locks and Viper Sting, Rogues hate level 1 blizzard in BG's making them pretty much pointless. Just usual vanilla stuff. 
---
Lol. This has to be a shit troll attempt. “This game is stupid. I’m outside all the time anyways getting like 12 blow jobs at once losers” 
---
Did you also spend an hour or two yesterday playing with talent calculators?
---
Go Undead. If you go shadow at any point, which is legit for buffing locks later on, devouring plague makes you awesome. 
---
More importantly, fear is such a popular mechanic in vanilla. While everyone is running in fear and waiting for tremor totem to trigger and your tank is being shredded apart while stance dancing, you could potentially save the attempt with the last second shield on him 
---
...what 
---
It is clear in the video that the lead designer thinks sharding is antithetical to Classic. In that respect, it appears both you and him agree that it isn't the best idea.
---
If this is a major issue for you, it might be best to assume Blizzard isn't going to cave on this one. It doesn't affect gameplay in the long run. It is a time-limited, one-time (in-)convenience that likely won't affect any long-term gameplay, especially as people level out of those zones. (Maybe early professions)
---
Look on the bright side: it might only last for a week. Maybe less if the retail players don't show any real interest. People are saying there will be a new BFA patch in the summer, so there may be new content to keep them content.

Disc tree in Vanilla is a mixed bag with buffs to healing and dps. I think people usually go for a 21/30/0 build. Don’t remember seeing many 31 disc priests in raids.
---
I play hunter because it just feels right to me. I can be one of those people that want to chase dps numbers and roll a rogue or mage but something about the hunter play style keeps me drawn in. I’ve tried to play a warlock and while the leveling is just as fast and the pvp fun as well, I still wanted to just play a hunter.
---
I know I’m not gonna top the damage meters after the pre-bis period/early mc yet I will still remain a hunter. Once you realize you’re more of a ranged support class with tons of utility, despite being a pure dps class, you’ll enjoy the vanilla hunter. 
---
This is why I think people should really find a class they think feels right for them rather than asking “which class does most dps and can 1v5 in wpvp”. Hopefully not a lot of those people in retail that chase damage meters will keep that mindset in classic. 
---
[Hurricane](http://classicdb.ch/?item=2824) dropped for me and my mate from the pirates outside booty bay. Sold it on AH for 140g, and it paid for a mount for one of us.
---
In 2v2 I wouldn't sleep on mage/pala.  Go 3 min mage, delete someone right at the start of the fight, then 2v1.
---
Raziya has tons of great videos as well! 
---
WoW isn't a hard game. If you're bad its because you're not putting enough time to learn the game or your class. Therefore they are intentionally being bad. How can YOU not see the hypocrisy?
---
If you're going for the bleeding edge best possible healer in the game, no. If you're looking for a good healer that can do it's job well, has tons of utility, and is fun to play, Yes you want to play it. No other class can brez or innervate so they are necessary.
---
This thread just proves one of the reasons why the Devs added way too much shit in the game.
---
Look at all the STRONG opinions people have here as to what was more fun or what “ruined” the game.
---
All of this complaining and demanding of removal/addition of items or mechanics is why are we are where we are.
---
(And Activision blows I know they have a huge fault too).
---
They clearly do listen to community wants, this is why we have fucking Battle Pets and transmog now 
---
Make sure to grind out close to 1 silver for the training and the skinning knife before head up to org
---
This is fucking grossly misinformed.
---
You will not DPS you will not tank.
---
The best spec doesn't use hots at all.
---
They're a very good mana efficient healer with a poison cure hot so when fights drag on like aq40 and naxx they're really good. All top guilds bought a couple to raids all the way through. There was one with atiesh on my server in vanilla.
---
31 disc is a more modern thing than real vanilla.
---
When you say things like that, it's like you are just admitting that you don't understand the problem
---
For me it was questing. I remember creating my char after sign up for trial account. I did not know anything about the game, not how things works, what classes are, what you can do etc. i only knew the game by its name. So after first time login in i figured i needed to kill mobs and just kept killing mobs untill about level 14, went from goldshire to sentinell hils by wandering around and kill everything that acorssed me. I always thought questing was just some store related not knowing it would give you xp, coins or items. 
---
Until this day a friend of me who apparently was playing too, created a new account and hit level 17 in just 1/2 days as i can remember. I was shocked and thought he was some kind of cheaper. I asked him how he did that then he told me he got boosted(DM) and was doing a lot of quests.... 
---
mind you, it took me almost 3 months to reach level 28 ... not playing hardcore hours though.
---
[Fiery War Axe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=870/fiery-war-axe) from Scarlet Monastery on my Holy paladin alt.
---
She was only about level 33 at the time and I won it on a greed roll as I planned to level her as a healer.
---
I already had a level 60 and was well aware of how much I could make selling it on the AH but something in me decided not to, at level 35 I respecced her to Retribution, [which she's been for 14 years since](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/sylvanas/hottage).
---
&gt;Huge login queues that infuriated the player base
---
&gt;Servers crashing from player load
---
These can be solved with modern server infrastructure. Servers can handle more concurrent players today than they could in 2004, right?
---
&gt;Dead servers as short-time players moved on
---
They're already fixing this by temporarily increasing the population cap by their projected player loss, right? If they expect to lose 25% of players, they start the server with a 25% increased cap.
---
How do you think they were going to address it? Are you able to see this has nothing to do with sharding? As soon as they leave the starter zone, it will be just like there was no sharding, right? How does that help with "dead servers bc short-time players"? It doesn't. Increasing the initial population cap does.
---
So what is the reason for sharding then? Only one: the inconvenience, challenge, and competition of a fresh server environment is seen as something the modern customer can not handle.
---
&gt; What happens when 2 hours pass and they've left the starter zone?
---
You are not going to level 10 in two hours. Tourists, by definition, will not hang around that long. Otherwise they're not tourists
---
Alright, I'm not quite to that point. Just take a step back and take a deep breath.
---
Ive been avoiding doing that for months now.  I really, really, really dont want to 'spoil' it.
---
Its getting more and more difficult D:
---
My first one was the dwarven handcannon. Was in a stratUD group and it dropped on the third trash pack on the way to the spider boss.
---
Group agreed to have everyone need roll on it. I as a fury warrior won it. 
---
The guild I wad in did a weekly lottery to help pay for consumes and enchants, I offered it up as part of the pool for the next drawing, but after talking about it the GM and I decided to just have the hunters /roll for it.
---
Chandrena from Draka, if you're reading this, no I haven't found you a new gun yet.
---
Im torn between wanting it as soon as possible, and wanting it after the weather starts to turn to shit.  I only get 3-4 months of nice weather per year, and i want to go out (real life) fishing, etc with that time :(
---
*twitch*
---
And how would the game engine define a twink?  There's no xp/no-xp option.  There're no heirlooms.  So what's a twink?  Someone wearing a blue item?  They can't segregate twinks until you can teach a computer what a twink is.
---
I never had an epic world drop in my entire time playing. I think my brother got a Hurricane but obviously that’s nothing to be excited about given it’s low value.
---
&gt; Atmosphere is a huge thing for me in MMORPGs. I always enjoyed WoW because there would never be a moment where I didn't see other players, except for nights.
---
I think that's awesome. They are only going to have sharding for a few weeks, so maybe your best time to start is just a few weeks after launch.
---
As a warrior that's why I always went out of my way to get that Imperial Plate set... Looks awesome (IMO) and decent stats. 
---
Stockade Pauldrons while farming Larval Acid for my Hide of the Wild in EPL, gave them to my friend warrior

I just open random pvp videos on youtube for background music.
---
Exactly, not 35 min lol. It will be a good while before we see those numbers. 
---
Run to Orgrimmar? Isn’t there a Skinner in Darkspear Village?

I may sub a month early just to avoid having to worry about unexpected issues popping up when it's time to rush 60.

Quest guide should be pretty accurate and has maps and stuff. First one is for 20-30, other one continues to endgame. Occasionally 1 or 2 quests every 10 levels that were added in TBC.  I used it when I had never played Alliance before and didn't grind really at all throwing in some instances. Stockades is stupidly quick and has lots of quests for example. BFD is something anyone who can use a wand is definitely going to want to do.
---
Until 20 just alternate human/NE dwarf depending on race. Do the starter area to 10 then move to either NE or Dwarf and do the easy ones, then back to westfall and around 20 to deadmines/quests. Then follow the guides. You only have to grind a few levels if you do not instances, which is stupid imo anyways.
---
Horde has Joana's.
---
Leveling is not hard it just take along time. Its a huge grind even with a proper leveling spec.
---
Leveling with a Healing spec just makes the 1-60 10x longer and more annoying its not recommended.
---
you will be leveling abit slower. Or you just pair up with a friend or someone to level with
---
Go hpally. You won't have mobility, aside from blessing of freedom, but you'll be really hard to kill and you won't run out of Mana, period. You won't the perfect flag carrier like a druid, but you are a runner up if you go holy/prot
---
this is the biggest straw man of all time?? No one is saying this, or thinking this. If people weren't vocal about their opinions we would still have 4 phases of content.
---
You don't need to spec full healer to heal leveling 5mans, maybe just a few points here and there.
---
Since you were talking about druid specifically before, you want to spec feral to level, and you can do any role in dungeons. Just keep a few sets of gear. It's exactly what I'll be doing. 
---
Paladin / warrior / Lock would prob dominate
---
Well it's kind of true and people will get pissed off if you use innervate on yourself or the wrong person. But in all seriousness resto druids are not bad, your heals are ok.. it's just that other healers like priests and shamans are preferred but you will always have a spot in the raid thanks to innervate/combat ress.
---
Also, if you want to PvP from time to time you will have a great time as druid.
---
Go! Go! Gypsy fans!
---
[https://i.imgur.com/q8a1Fdn.png](https://i.imgur.com/q8a1Fdn.png)
---
Mostly you level as your dps spec. So if you're a priest, you run shadow, druid runs feral etc. It's possible to level as your healing spec, but it's inefficient. 
---
You have no way of knowing why they're bad though, they could be new and are putting in effort and rapidly improving yet are still bad.
---
competitive environment: see "didnt work" 
---
I had several free game time day from launch because the servers were so fucked - it was literally unplayable - why do I want that dogshit experience with 2 hour server queues again? 
---
If i play this game for 2 years and the first two weeks are sharded then that less than 2% of my total time playing that will have been sharded - why do i give a fuck about 2% when it means I could have a super smooth launch instead.
---
Hyacinth macaw does drop in STV from the pirates, thats how I got mine originally in vanilla
---
Since it's under the same account...sure it will apply.
---
Very small issue but one of you will have to do the wetlands gaunlet as you'll both be on opposite ends of Azeroth if you wanna be a pally and they wanna be an NE. I think they're great choices but be aware someone is gonna have to die a few times to get to the other  ): 
---
I know you're exaggerating to make a point. But it doesnt make leveling 10x slower. Its more like 20% slower really and even then its class dependent.
---
Hell no, there's no way it'll be half as good as it was as a teenager, new to MMOs, in 2005 when nobody knew what they were doing and the game was still a giant mystery. 
---
But that's the thing...classic WoW, played out, 15 years later, old graphics, dated design, been copied 100 times, is still better than any existing MMO. It'll be fun as fuck, just not quite as dangerously addictive as it was back then.
---
What I love (but sometimes kinda hate) about healing, is how in most cases, you are the only person to know if you saved the raid. Healing metres show who's best at spamming, and has the biggest mana pool, and most + healing, not who saved the tank from 4 killing blows by using a cooldown / shield / having a heal pre-cast just in time for the boss ability. 
---
You're kinda the silent hero that nobody notices (if you're doing well that is). For me personally, that's super rewarding, as a DPS, the best I can do is being x percent better than the second best guy, as a healer I can potentially be the guy that saves the day (People just don't notice because they're busy being x percent better than someone else). 
---
If you're highly competitive (as in I wanna be better than others, with focus on others) it might not be for you. An interesting thing about healing is that if all the healers are too competitive about healing the most, the healing actually becomes much less efficient. Theoretically, for example, HoTs are super efficient - but in reality they are often a waste on anyone but tanks, because some pally / shaman will have FoL / CH'ed that person up before your HoT gets to actually do more than a single tick. 
---
I can definitely recommend healing as you can maybe tell. Raid healing is generally more boring than instance healing, but at the same time more intense, mainly because it goes on for longer, making efficiency as important (or more) than being super good at prioritising the right heal for the right situation. 
---
Between July 15th and August 15th.
---
&gt; I went from mindlessly grinding away on a Ret Paladin with no Talents
---
Then you were just a Paladin, not a ret one :p
---
&gt;  It'll basically be a +5k pop server until the "tourists" quit, right?
---
I'm stating this again and again. No matter what Blizzard does in this case, the community will not be happy. There's a handful of scenarios and all of them suck...
---
1. Blizzard will use Sharding in much more zones because players keep on playing longer than anticipated\
---
This would suck because we don't really want sharding.
---
2. Blizzard will not use sharding but players still keep on playing.\
---
This would suck because we would have to fight for resources / questmobs / etc with so many players, stopping us from actually experiencing the game in it's original state.
---
3. Blizzard will use much more servers but players will be quitting as expected.\
---
This would suck because suddenly we'll have a huge amount of servers where a mayor part of it's playerbase will be lost, forcing realm merges something like half a year after the start. You will lose your server identity and have to figure things out anew...
---
4. Blizzard will use much more server but players keep on playing.\
---
That'd be awesome. Sadly though this is the scenario which is the least likely ...
---
So yeah, no matter what blizz does, the ... entitled playerbase ... will hate it, will be very loud about it and will make sure that people resound their opinions. 
---
Personally: I'm pretty relaxed. Classic will be what we make out of it. If mayor parts of the community are noisy assholes complaining about every little thing that's misbehaving then classic will fail. But if we'd all be a little bit more relaxed, classic could turn out wonders and potentially even shape BLIZZARD back to a company that chooses game quality and duration rather than instant gratification at every corner...
---
Was wow leveling ever meant to be a "competitive enviroment"? Fighting tooth-and-nail for every single mob and item seems a bit silly to me. I went trought the nostalrius experience when it was dying down and even then I wouldn't consider it fun at all. Fuck the doomweed quest.
---
What I think you're missing is the amount of players that are going to be there at launch and quit before 60.
---
Wow is much better known than it was when it launched. (subs grew over time if the graphs aren't too far off) There isn't a limit on copies since you don't need to buy a disc anymore, you can just download and even preload so you can log in the moment it launches. In addition to that, classic is going to be free for current retail players.
---
There never was a similar launch experience since with any non-sharded expansion, new players had to start at lvl 1. Makes sense they added lvl boosting and sharding close to each other.
---
I always kind of missed Arena in vanilla, not because I would need it there but it's a cool feature that was missing. It would be fun to challenge 2 great players from a guild you compete with and just beat it out. Would add a lot of rivalry. But to be honest, you have got the point, it doesnt really fit the environment of vanilla and could ruin the feel.
---
Nyes 
---
That would be a reason if the subscriptions would be separate.
---
There is no "clash" between Classic and Retail, since they are under the same subscription.
---
Well, there is a philosophical "clash"...but other than that, nope.
---
During the first run they merged servers occasionally to manage population, and offered free targeted transfers as well.  
---
Oh if only Ramen were actually a healthy food.
---
&gt; Servers can handle more concurrent players today than they could in 2004, right?
---
You can't throw hardware at every problem. There is a real game design problem. The Azeroth world was designed for about 2500 concurrent players maximum. Exceeding that creates gameplay problems.
---
&gt; They're already fixing this by temporarily increasing the population cap by their projected player loss, right? If they expect to lose 25% of players, they start the server with a 25% increased cap.
---
First of all, they don't know what that project loss is. Is it 25%? Is it 50%? We are literally in uncharted waters. With a content drought in BFA, we might literally see 1.5 million retail players try to log onto Classic servers in the first week "just to see" vs. 200K long term Classic players. That plausible scenario would put the tourist rate at 85%. 
---
&gt; So what is the reason for sharding then? Only one: the inconvenience, challenge, and competition of a fresh server environment is seen as something the modern customer can not handle.
---
The reason for sharding is because no one has any idea how big the initial surge is going to be, how much of it is going to be long-lasting, and how to deal with it without servers crashing (short term) or becoming dead (long term). Sharding is probably the most flexible way to mitigate those risks.
---
Classes/specs that shine at 60 also shine at 49. But the class that gets the biggest boost compared to 60 is hunter. Pets don't scale at all and hunters scale poorly so they benefit a lot from not having big raid gear stat boosts in play. Also viper sting doesn't scale at all and mana pools are smaller which makes it more impactful.
---
I'll be playing night elf hunter come classic. I would like to get The Rake when I'm around level 15. Which is going to be a pain for the travel. since i'll have to hike it naked through Duskwood and STV. Then run al the way to Mulgore. 
---
But what do you guys think. Is this going to be worth it? First off all the Rake is a rare spawn. second off all I'm going to be a lonely naked level 15 night elf in the horde starter zone's during launch. Do you think i'll manage to get the pet, or should I just go for a Boar instead?
---
Felstriker, as a Rogue (who won this) I was so damn hyped I couldn't breathe. Having this in offhand and Fang of the Faceless in main hand, that was a PvP-combo set of daggers. Man I almost cried.
---
It sounds counter intuitive but he makes a great argument against debt in general and using money to invest. But if you enjoy the credit card rewards for paying bills you are going to pay anyway, I don't see the harm. It helps build credit.
---
It is not a good combo for leveling.
---
After? Might be.
---
I broke down and ordered my new PC!
---
I dont even remember. I think it was that level 30'ish bow. Found one in STV I believe. Might've been called Hurricane but I just know it was kinda worthless at the time because I didn't get rich off it :P
---
Came here to advice the same. Kargoz' hunter guide is amazing and def a must watch for all who are new to classic hunters. 
---
I wish I hadn't lost my shitty Fraps footage from Vanilla. Nobody would be impressed now, but the nostalgia would be fun.
---
Not if you are a Gnome Female.
---
Blizzard make more off of the tokens than they do regular subs
---
You can tank as a dps warrior as long as you bring a shield and you can heal as a dps as long as you spend your mana wisely. You have to remember that "specs" in classic don't exists, you get everything as everything, the only difference is how you spend your talent points, which mostly just increase healing by a few percentage and/or reduce mana costs. The big talents are nice, but not needed.
---
Good answer, touches on everything.
---
***We still can't have sharding.***
---
If you understand that sharding is antithetical to the Classic experience, you can't then justify using it in select cases in your next sentence. That is a gate left open. That is not a road we can allow the Classic developers to go down.
---
My proposed solution to handle launch day / week congestion;
---
1. Reduce maximum server cap below intended server cap for launch day.
---
2. Add queues.
---
People will spread out across multiple servers if the one they are trying to join has a large queue.
---
If server populations dwindle after launch, offer free transfers ***like you used to*****.**
---
You'll be fine everyone needs healers and the flexibility druids bring.  The other reason to play resto is to be really really really annoying and evasive  in almost every PVP situation. 
---
I play hunter because they're a lot of fun, but a lot of classes are tbh.
---
The real reason is the high skill ceiling which means you stand out more as a hunter if you perform well. People who aren't used to how realm communities  and notoriety work might underestimate how important this is.
---
Hunters *absolutely fucking destroy* during leveling - other classes come close but can't quite compete and the server first 60s will likely be hunters. Great DPS in dungeons, solid in PvP with the right gear/talents, you will piss off rogues which feels good. There's a bunch of rare and unique pets to go hunt and tame if you want, or you can develop a bond with your first pet over the course of the game if you're not a minmaxer. The class fantasy is perfect; bows, pets, traps, especially if you take skinning/leatherworking and make your own gear (if you're not too bothered about gold). Aspect of the pack at level 20 for 30% movement speed which feels amazing.
---
Sadly they do drop towards the bottom of DPS metes when it comes to raiding, but guilds bring a couple for the utility. The rotation also isn't hugely interesting but that's the case for a lot of classes in vanilla.
---
Feral tanks are also really good. Especially in MC/BWL you can have just about any spec in there. Later on it becomes more difficult but possible. What really sucks is that the hunter dps really tapers off after BWL and by Naxx there's usually just one hunter there who buffs the melee and tranq shots. That's a real shame because it's not like they can heal instead.
---
You just level with a dps spec then switch at 60.  You can heal leveling dungeons in any spec.
---
Not to re-iterate the same talking points over and over. Classic is more about Utility than raw HPS.  You bring a really strong buff in mark/gift of the wild.  Thorns is great for tanks. Innervate is strong for healers in long fights. and the only battle res in the game (aside from soul stones but those have to be pre-calculated).  and in vanilla there is no limit to the number of in combat resses.
---
You don't have an actual res though so that can sometimes be a pain in 5 man dungeons if you have a half wipe, some people will have to walk back unless you have another res class in a DPS form in the dungeon.
---
the downside to HoTs for druids in raids is that they don't stack.  So if you have 3 druids, you can't have 3 rejuvs on a tank, only 1.  But they are very mana efficient and have strong single target heals.  
---
Your tranq spell is on a longer CD and only works on group members so it isn't really a huge utility but can be useful. 
---
That being said are you looking for top 1% world first guild type healing, or casual come as you are?  the 1st will optimize, the 2nd doesn't care much and will bring 3-4 druids if they are reliable and will show up.. the biggest boss in the game is the 40 man roster boss. Show you can be there, be ready, and not stand in fire and you'll have a spot. 
---
Have you tried contacting the creator of the addon? 
---
Either way i would say that give it some time. Addons **will** be created once people start playing the game.
---
Resto is fine, the only real issue in raids is that hots don't stack.
---
Or they could.... you know... play retail instead? It's a shared subscription after all.
---
Classic will use 7.3.5 as a base client, so we can assume that legion addons works, but nothing is confirmed as of yet.
---
I still wish we got Classic wow with BC balance changes. Vanilla was cool and all but some classes were quite poorly designed. Itemization was also pretty bad for all hybrids.
---
It is, most people are just confused about how spell batching actually works.
---
My first epic world-drop if you can call it a drop was a Teebu's Blazing Longsword that  I got out of a junkbox that I pick pocketed off the 
---
&gt; I believe there will be an insane amount of bots
---
Well, you're wrong.  Blizzard is quite adept at identifying repetitive scripted behavior now.
---
Yeah thats my thoughts, if its only from my perspective then its no harm and i have the classic experience but with nicer looking models :)
---
Ele Resto Shaman here,
---
You level as any other spec and just have gear with int and spirit on it for group quests and instances.
---
I.e as a shaman I'll pump points into enhance for flurry for leveling, and then just respec for 1g at 40 to go elemental. 
---
You only just need a healer set or gear with a lot of mana from int to be an effective healer.
---
Dude I was a resto druid and loved it. I also innervated myself if i needed it. Unless you are with the most hardcore guild in the world it’ll be fine. Resto druids are sooooo much fun.
---
But it doesn’t hold. 
---
The guy didn’t ask for your opinion in either scenario even if it did. 
---
Usually when you try to construct an analogy you do so based on the factual situation you are trying to reframe. But here you didn’t. So it fails.
---
I’m sorry you’re so extraordinarily stupid that you can’t even defend yourself with a properly constructed analogy. 
---
It’s pretty pathetic that you’re too stupid to see that you literally just stepped in it more by trying to use a incorrectly made analogy to reframe what happened. But that’s where we are. Again, does it pay well to be NPC?
---
How will I express my indifference then?
---
Are you not including dps warriors as tanks in the list? Seems like a lot of these fights I would consider maybe you’re right just 2 tanks, but have a dps Warrior or feral Druid offtank as Well. Doing Garr with 2 tanks is extremely rough when you have no gear. Unless you bring like 6 warlocks?
---
Why do you want it? For the looks, or for the attack speed? You can get tame a common [mountain lion](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=22193) with the same attack speed from hillsbrad at level 23.
---
How nice it would be to have a few hundreds welcoming you to the chaos as you leave 😂
---
&gt;You can't throw hardware at every problem.
---
Nost servers in a Russian basement could handle +10k players. I think Activision Blizzard will be able to spare some pennies and manage the infrastructure don't you think?
---
&gt;There is also a real game design problem. The Azeroth world was designed for about 2500 concurrent players maximum. Exceeding that creates gameplay problems.
---
There is going to be a "tourist problem," no? How is that being solved again, do you remember?
---
You're having a hard time not conflating the temporary increased cap and sharding. Sharding alone doesn't solve the "servers becoming dead" problem. If they had a 2.5k cap, and then sharded the starting zones, that doesn't help you can see that right?
---
So the idea is they will, just at launch, let the servers have higher population to mitigate the eventual losses of players. This is fine. This has nothing to do with sharding.
---
You think 75% of players will leave the game after the first week? Well, that means the server pop would have to be 10k to then be reduced to 2.5k.
---
Nost, a server run by literal volunteers, was able to manage this. You think Activision Blizzard won't be able to manage the same?
---
&gt;Fuck the doomweed quest.
---
Exactly. If the quest is congested, move on to another quest or another zone. 
---
Veteran Hpally here. Your biggest concern will be holding on to all the gear (including cloth int gear and a shield and 1hander) while you level if you wanna do all 3 roles. Talent points are kinda irrelevant when doing low level dungeons. Warriors tank as fury or arms all the time before lvl 60 dungeons. It's much better to go ret till 40 and then do prot for aoe grinding. It'll take you a while to get to 60 if you start as holy/prot without a leveling partner
---

Ion might not be the best guy for retail. But the way he describes this makes me feel confident about sharding only being temporary. 
---
In early days of Vanilla Dungeons could be done with 20 man. 
---
Why were the servers "fucked", why were there 2 hour queues? Is it because the 2004 hardware couldn't handle it, and the server cap was ~2.5k?
---
Modern hardware can handle +10k players. The Nost server run by literal *volunteers* was able to handle this.
---
So there is no need for queues or server crashes. Unless, of course, Activision Blizzard isn't willing to pay for the infrastructure needed to handle that many players concurrently.
---
I don't know this man
---
If this shit gets delayed the Otters might as well kill me. Won't make it.
---
Wait, you think the tourists will leave in two hours and never play again? Then why is it being sharded in the first place? The problem will solve itself in two hours **LOL**.
---
Could anyone tell me about the burst potential in pvp of a hunter in vanilla? I'm close to 100% sure to pick an Orc Hunter (that is what i started with 2 weeks after WotLK release). My other options are Orc ele shaman and Undead Spriest.
---
I know Elemental shaman can put out some huge burst in pvp  (which will be my go to thing together with the occasional raid pug), but how does a hunter do this? For example: Am I able to 1-2 shot enemy cloth/leather users with the right items? Besides /laughing at my enemy while he slowly dies of my dots as an Spriest the most enjoyable thing in pvp is just nuking my enemy out and into nowhere with huge crits.
---
Also: Why the hell did I have more patience in my teens than my 30s? 
---
Happened to me about a month ago, they refunded 3 months and gave me a free 2 month pass for classic wow for when it comes out (I just send in a ticket and they'll activate my account). 
---
Definitely not too 1% me and my guild now are like 120 on our server atm 
---
Yeah that’s confusing. I guess people would assign druids to groups? Could be interesting though
---
Actually Wrath was the Dead of WoW.   
---
Ulduar was the BEST Raid they designed but 3.3 Patch killed the game for me ToC Ketchup Mechanic. LFG/RDF. Easy HC-Dungeons. Faceroll Naxxramas. Sry but Wotlk is in my eyes THE Casual-Game when it comes down to WoW. Even Cataclysm was Hard but ppl bitch about that also. But Remember HC-Dungeons before the nerfs... Ohh Boy what a mess of Dungeons. This Warth baby cried how hard the Dungeons were and all those TBC-Players cried how happy they are they have hard dungeons again. But nope 2 Weeks later the Nerf-Hammer came and the HC felt like normals. But Ragnaros HC 25 Man.. THE Hardest Boss of all times. Even Mechanic wise
---
Very cool. Thanks for sharing!
---
I think I'll watch this one repeat about 700,000 times until Classic releases.
---
gz
---
You have several options:
---
1. You can level as DPS spec and respec when your healing becomes an issue.  
---
2. Level with groups (most players will be happy to have a pocket healer)
---
3. Up until about level 40 you won't lose much DPS by going with the heal spec, if you want to start off that way
---
4. You're generally a lot tankier, because you can cast your heals while taking damage and you have more efficient heals
---
5. Lots of classes have hybrid specs.  For example, as a Paladin you could go 11 points into Ret in order to get Seal of Command (your biggest boost in solo damage) and then go 21 points into Holy (the majority of your healing power) and then go back into ret.  
---
Boy you're just all over the place, aren't you?
---
Good that was my plan to play one so I’m happy there is love for it. 
---
I think the goal is to get as many people interested as possible. This isn't like it was back in 2004. Word of mouth advertising isn't going to work. They need as many people as possible right from the beginning and then in a year they can look at the numbers and figure out what to do from there. It makes sense to me that they want a launch experience as smooth as possible given that.
---
Yeah this sub is like 50/50. Personally I'm pretty sick of hearing the phrase, "pre-raid BIS list". 
---
If you want to be the fastest, grind all the way to a quest, grind all the way back.  Don't hunt specific mobs for the quest but kill all of them in the area (for example, if you need 10 Pathfinders and nothing else, kill all the Knuckledusters in your way to get to the Pathfinders instead of ignoring the Knuckledusters or going around them).
---
Yes.
---
Because last time I had nothing to compare it to.  Now I have Retail to compare it to.
---
&gt; Honestly, pre-60 instances are more a fanciful luxury than anything. 
---
Instances with friends are where the real wow is at, man!
---
Full on Dennis Reynolds *I AM A GOD*
---
Lol I wasn’t saying that but if being outside is so special to you then idk. 
---
But if someone assumes shit about me I will take my time out &amp; tell the truth lol you can stay inside all day idgaf but that’s not me 
---
sounds like it will be flooded with loot for everyone.. it will not.
---
Where are you getting these numbers from? Gold is gonna be alot more scarce than people from Pservers are used to. Number of players and the content available usually boosts the gold gain way too much on Pservers. It's gonna be different, believe me.
---
My old PC wouldn't run the legion client and music at the same time. Plus I wanted a new pc!
---
It seemed vague when I remember reading that post if the stats would change or not.  Did they say specifically they wouldn't change the power of items over the phases?
---
The quote was: 
---
&gt;there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.
---
they're talking about drop rates and locations.  and not sure about "power" being the buff or unbuffed versions of items.   Something like Truefaith vestments for priests, the healing changed from 66 to 73 ([https://itemization.github.io/1.2/armor/chest/truefaith-vestments-14154.html](https://itemization.github.io/1.2/armor/chest/truefaith-vestments-14154.html))
---
That could be included in their phrase "don't have a big effect on player power" or not im not 100% sure it's a bit vague. I am hoping they come out with specific details Soon (TM)
---
&gt; ...letting twinkers grief levellers...
---
I'm not fan of twinks myself, but what they do is certainly not griefing.  It's fair and 100% allowed within the confines the game presents us.  I might consider them annoying little jerks who have to resort to unbalanced PvP brackets to get their kicks because they can't hang with the good PvPers at 60, but they are definitely not griefing.
---
pservers don't need it so why would classic need such a tool? you get to know your server population..after a while.
---
But client is way higher version and thus invalids alot of add-ons due to incompatibility.
---
You will not be able to use the same add-ons as private servers because the underlying game is the current client, 8.X.X. So WoW Classic will run modern add-ons, however, Blizzard said at BlizzCon there are certain features in the modern API that they don't want to allow in Classic but they haven't worked out all the details yet.
---
So it will most likely be modern add-ons, but some won't work and some may need to be re-created specifically for Classic.
---
I mean that's why only two locks were getting into Naxx and AQ. CoE and CoW.
---
So you leveled entirely by PVP and also had dungeon gear?
---
Usually any non needed bop/boe gear was defaulted too me. Guild provided my enchants and the guilds alchemist took care of the big cost consumables.
---
Their stated goal was to recreate Vanilla as authentically as possible. This means that there should be weather effects, hopefully very faithfully reimplemented.
---
There were no weather effects in the demo and we've gotten no update on it so far.
---
thx

---
From how it's been explained to me, loot sharing isn't far off from master looter. 
---
Both can be manipulated by less friendly players.
---
Both allow groups to shun the outsider and deny loot.
---
Both are dependant in the decency of the players using them.
---
So all in all, if there isn't sharding, then you only have to worry about your reputation on your server. Call out ninja or guilds that take advantage of the system to their own gain. Blacklist them if need be.
---
I don't want loot sharing, but both are flaws and I understand why. 
---
they constantly stress they want an authentic experience and recreation, they go to ridiculous lengths to restore a small fog effect on the dwarf login screen. new models and animations are not happening, you can count on it.
---
(;
---
That to help :)  120 on server (depending on server) I assume is pushing mid/later heroic with maybe 1-2 mythic bosses?  yeah you should be fine with a druid if you are in the same guild or looking for a similar guild.
---
Back in vanilla I raided as a warlock but we had 4 druids and we pushed into AQ40 / Naxx (with everything else full clear) just fine.  we never beat C'thun or 4 horsemen but we were probably terrible by todays standards but we had a lot fun and that's what matters, right? :)
---
Pro Tip:  look up down ranking and how it works with your +healing and the 5 second rule for mana regen in combat (along with mp5) :)
---
I have no life so I would absolutely be happy with no changes. We have been speedrun testing on every private server that pops up and I'm pretty sure we can be far enough out ahead to have whole zones to ourselves with less than an hour being spent clawing out a lead.
---
That being said idc either way, low level sharding is fine imo, my only fear is that if we don't freak the fuck out and boycott when they change things, it'll let the investors know that we are open to change, and so the convenient changes that coincidentally have p2w elements and prioritize "engagement" will begin.
---
The only way to stop the investors from ruining classic wow like a disease is to simply never fuck around.
---
Precisely. PvE in particular is 100% figured out at this point. It's all math. All the info is laid out in exhaustive articles. 
---
PvP is slightly more interesting to discuss because of the human element, it's actually possible to have a debate about X class or spec, but the "meta" is also pretty well figured out.
---
&gt; You don't need to spec full healer to heal leveling 5mans, maybe just a few points here and there.
---
This is just bad advice. Spec whatever does the most damage, a strict healing spec isn't needed. 
---
I remember back in vanilla, I was playing an elemental mage, and dueling this warrior outside Orgrimmar, ofc. keeping him frozen and slowed as you're supposed to. 
---
After I won the duel, he said something about only cowards play mage, and he would totally own me if he was actually able to land hits on me. 
---
After that he mounted up with confidence, and ran away, having now redeemed himself with a moral win, and told me how he was a much better player, it's just the freezes and slows that made him lose.
---
He was right, mages were very bad at melee combat against melee classes, and I would indeed have lost, had I not been able to kite this warrior on my mage.
---
For some reason your comment reminded me of that episode, so many years later! Good times.
---
You can get quite good gear.  There's lots of tricks to do it.  Mostly it involves having a level 60 friend who is not grouped with you kill everything so you only get XP for the quest mobs for quest rewards, or bosses in a dungeon.
---
Half of the gear comes from BoEs, and half of the power comes from enchants.  
---
In TBC I had a very mean backstabby 19 rogue.
---
You couldn't skin the creatures in the 1-4 (Valley of Trials, Northshire Abbey, Deathknell, etc) area of the starting zones but creatures outside the initial area you could skin.
---
So is that just a private server thing? 
---

That was my first too :) i was soooo shocked when i've seen that purple text \^\^

---
Quest loot sharing is the sharding of quests if you boil it down. So yea.. Basically you are supporting sharding to an extent. 
---
I kinda think if you go into a BG way under the expected level, you deserve whatever you're going to get.
---
I'd always wait until 18-19 before going in.

Killing Furbogs endlessly for Timbermaw Exaltion
---
**Lei of Lillies**
---
We dont know how many quests are in at the start. If its like how it was at the start at vanilla, you are most likely gonna have to grind a few levels now and then.
---
Also grinding is just really hard to do inefficient. I know a lot of people who go to a zone, do 2 quests, then go to another zone, 2 more quests etc. If you do it like that ofc grinding is gonna be much more efficient. You are wasting so much time traveling.
---
This becomes really apparent at around level 40, when you have so many different zones to juggle and need to know what order you should do the zones, because you get follow up quests to go back and forward all the time.
---
&gt;  heavy reliance on HoTs.
---
It's so funny listening to people beating down "edgelords" and at the same time claiming druids rely on HoTs. 
---
Never played a Warrior in Vanilla but will be leveling one for Classic.  What did this 31/5/15 spec look like?  I threw this together but it's really only my best guess...
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSczf9AEATAD8ADA
---
Not sure if Toughness is a better choice than the Shield talent, or if I may want to max out the Parry talent in Arms since it is kind of a hybrid DPS/tank spec.
---
Thanks in advance for any input!  As someone who really just wants to tank 5/10 mans and maybe join some pug MC/Ony runs, a spec like this really appeals to me as it would allow me to casually farm and PvP as well as do the tanking I'd like to do!
---
The father, the son, and the Holy Ghost. 
---
&gt; Any plans on publishing your route?
---
Day 2 of launch, maybe :P Once I'm far enough ahead.
---
My 1-10 route is no secret, and my 12-60 grind still needs a lot of work, if I end up going this route.
---
U kill mobs, quest, and so on. Maybe the odd dungeon run
---
Honestly I don't think they'd really be that much work, because all the work has already been done - new models, skinning, animations etc. The animations have to be the exact same length for them to have seamlessly carried over, so really it shouldn't be that crazy big a job.
---
You may have had to do 30k of damage to a warlock to kill them though lol.
---
Just got jadefire mythic Tuesday :)
---
Thanks for the help
---
Ok thanks, gotcha :-P
---
&gt; my only fear is that if we don't freak the fuck out and boycott when they change things, it'll let the investors know that we are open to change
---
I think the people are wrong if they think that investors have much influence on classic. Classic is somewhat of a passion project for the wow devs. They've insisted a lot on the fact that they do care about an authentic classic experience. The recent news posts should have made that even more clear than before.
---
Blizzard still has to somehow manage both costs and resources as well as keeping the quality up so some compromises have to be made. I just believe that it's wrong to be so afraid and negative upfront when we simply don't have all the information yet.
---
&gt;  I do hope they don't add this, that's just my personal opinion, I love me some pixelated sharp edge clunky goodness. It's all down to the player isn't it. I can't stand the new animations now, it doesn't feel good
---
I think thats why so many people want a toggle.  Some prefer the new models, other prefer the old models.  It'd be nice to let everyone be happy since it really doesnt seem to effect gameplay in any way.
---
I hope they do add a toggle because it's purely clientside and the newer faces and animations etc are so much better. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but seeing as we can all run Classic on max-settings like 10 times over now, it would be good to have the new shadows, water and models etc.
---
You act like theres gonna be max 5 ppl When sharding is turned on
---
Thanks, interesting. I was thinking on a druid for the all around role (healing,DPS) + stealth benefit, plus flag carrier 
---
I understand the problem, I was waiting for the response.
---
The tourists should and can be calculated in. In which ways you ask ?
---
- doing market research, make polls on official forums to know how many people will play classic when it drops and how invested they are.
---
-second, separate subscription, in that way you deal with alot of tourists from BFA. 
---
Using this, more servers and a slightly higher population cap, I'd advocate for Max 5k orsomething.
---
Using all of this you minimize the the dead server issue. If for example 60% leave from a 5k max server you still left with 2k. A server where alot of people would be happy with back in the day. 
---
The early days are just early days. Why implement something when it's going to be over in "early days".  If you don't want the choas then wait a week or play at off hours. I for one will be joyfully with the clusterfuck haha
---
Ardent defender while leveling my dwarf hunter. I was too new too care about gold so I mailed it too my bank alt and held onto it incase I decided to level a new tank (bc was coming).
---
Sigh. That's probably my Druid...
---
I abused the PvP XP system in WotLK so bad.  I leveled probably 5-6 characters from 50+ just by AFKing in AV.  It was ridiculous how easy it was to level, at the expense of the rest of the team.  In fact, I think it was almost faster than leveling normally.  (Only problem is my gear was HORRIBLE when I hit 80).  
---
On the other hand, it completely killed my desire to do low-level PvP.  In TBC I would stop my characters at 19, 29, etc so I could gear them up from BGs, and in WotLK I would out-level the bracket if I did enough games to get the gear.  The only way is if I stopped my XP gain, and then I would be the only leveller in the bracket against fully geared opponents.
---
And as others have said, it doesn't do anything for those people in raid gear going up against fresh 60s in greens.
---
Demo pretty much confirmed we are getting old models.
---
Very, very difficult to beat dwarf paladin/warrior if all pots are allowed and given equal skill. 
---
I take real exception with the idea that the PvP system in Classic is Blizzard's "solution" to a problem.  Classic is the solution to the problems the changes have introduced.  Blizzard shouldn't need to fix anything except that which they broke.
---
Yeah, both systems are ass.
---
However, I do not think it's fair to compare loot sharing with master looter. If someone puts on master looter and steals all the loot for himself or thier group it's obvious. You know you can put that player on ignore and never play with them again. 
---
With loot sharing it's much harder to tell. Casters can need to all caster items and then funnel them to the friend that need it the most.
---
Like a mage needing to spellpower gear only to give it to thier healer. Loot sharing lets people be more sinister and get away with stealing loot much easier.
---
I think it will be a thorn in the community overall, as solo players will hesitate to trust and play with random people. In vanilla you had to trust people (crafts and what not). 
---
It only takes 2 people to abuse this system pretty hard.
---
You think tourists are all going to log on simultaneously?  **LOL**
---
Remember when Raging Berserker's Helm and Herod's Shoulder were mail armor?
---
Remember when a shaman used a massive two hander?
---
Balrigor remembers.
---
Seriously though, I was looking through some of my oldest accounts yesterday and found this guy who still had those items equipped from before they were Plate. Thought it was pretty cool.
---
Yea that’s what im saying, people act as if shards Will only have 5 players on them
---
Yeah a lot of shamans are forced to heal in PvE, but elemental is a serious PvP build. You'll be able to off heal when you're being pressured and throw out painful high dmg crits since you get crits dmg talents. Enhancement is just an rng meme build that sometimes has you beating people who you shouldn't be able to if you manage to get rolling windfury procs. Very high rng burst spec. If you get good gear, enhancement is fine, but still dependant on proccing windfury
---
Fun and all but you didn't play nearly enough to "evolve" any meta. You probably just steamrolled whatever with good gear and skilled players. 
---
Yes, though it's still a smart plan to run out and get skinning right after the starting as most people likely won't so there will be plenty of dead corpses up for grabs.
---
Also curious to how this looks. I'd be very interested in an spec that is able to be a competent offtank without sacrificing too much main damage for grinding outside of dungeons
---
You know it's real when the char is in either OG or SW standing by the bank showing off your gear prior to the clips. 
---
&gt;There is more epicness in the hard earned blues of classic than in the effortless epics of retail
---
Truth.  Not sure I've ever loved an item as much as my [Warblade of Caer Darrow.](https://www.wowhead.com/item=13982/warblade-of-caer-darrow)
---
Hard work pays off.
---
No seriously. Login queues were almost certainly the most hated problem in Vanilla, followed by server crashes.
---
There is absolutely zero chance that Blizzard is going to drive away new players (i.e. revenue) by implementing a solution that involves login queues.
---
But I m still young ? .. :D
---
My main was a priest and I played a priest on a pserver as well.  You can easily level with very minimal downtime time with Wand Specialization and Spirit Tap.
---

---
When I start playing something that I know I’ll love – I try to find out as much as possible prior and along with playing, so as to be optimal/not miss out on anything (this is not min-maxing, it’s some other OCD weirdness). So since I was quite an introverted kid back in Vanilla who never played an MMO before, I saw it mentioned multiple times that hunter is the best class to lvl solo and is the most self-sufficient class, and I thought “perfect, since I don’t want the hassle of talking to other people and am happy to just play alone in this huge world – this class is ideal for me”. Well, turned out I somehow naturally found a lvling partner before stepping off Teldrassil, formed a guild by lvl 30 that lasted even beyond my departure from the game at the end of WotLK, and never really did that much solo play in the end, if any. So basically it turned out to be a pretty stupid decision when I was picking a class…
---
…
---
Or did it? Nah, of course not! Hunter is LOVE. Hunter is LIFE. Hunter is EVERYTHING (just like everything is hunter, including weapons)! It’s honestly an extremely fun and unique class, with so many mechanics and tricks that to master it - would take quite a while. There’s this widespread opinion that hunter is the easiest class, and I believe it’s a huge mistake, stemming from the true statement of “hunter is the easiest class TO LEVEL” – I guess that last part got lost in translation. The truth is, hunter is one of the most skill-intensive classes in WoW in both PvP and raiding, and you can immediately tell a good hunter from a bad hunter if you know where to look.
---
But if I had to give just one reason for playing hunter – for me it was the pet system. It’s like a mini pokemon game inside WoW, and really speaks to the collector in me. There are so many unique pets, and many of them are so difficult, hence so satisfying to get, that it really is an adventure if you decide to go with it.
---
The thing is, with a toggle option you can still 100% experience it the Vanilla way, or if you choose to, you can use the new models.  That doesnt effect anyone elses gameplay in any way, shape or form.  It doesnt give you an advantage.
---
I mean, by the logic of authentic recreation you shouldnt be able to play at high resolution, either.
---

---
yeah sure, wotlk was just as good as vanilla and TBC...
---
I've played a gnome warrior since beta... they were in.
---
Generally you won't even see 2-4 hunters in a raid, you'll be lucky to see 2. They're actually pretty low dps compared to other dps classes, and they don't offer much in terms of raid buffs/unique abilities. You'll always need at least one for most raids to use tranquilizing shot.
---
What root and stun does shaman have? Priest with poly? Rogue with fear? 
---
Same! Was questing in Silithus, probably lvl 58 at the time. 
---
&gt; Every movie coming out is crap.
---
I understand this about the advertised-in-your-face blockbuster types.  If you dig a little though, we're in an age with many good movies.
---
&gt;Gear selections, class-race combos, specs, group and raid compositions. All aimed at being the best tank/healer/dps/group/raid.
---
All of this is 100% figured out years ago and there's nothing left to discuss raid-wise. You can find the info on this subreddit, private server forums, etc. 
---
The only real unknown factors at this point are things like mob stats, exact resource generation rates, spawn rates, etc. that was never player-visible. Private servers might have them wrong, which affects difficulty/speed of various encounters, but not really any choices the player can make. 
---
Thumbs up, realy like it. I missed the first one I guess but I followed you now, so it shouldn't happen again.
---
In regards to your last point, you’re wrong. I have played Nostalrius on a 3440x1440p 120hz Ultrawide panel and it works just fine. UI even scaled, so that’s a bad and misinformed argument. 
---
Additionally, knowing you look a certain way, especially to other people, is enormously important. That you are seeing what they’re seeing. 
---
Rest assured, new models and animations are not happening. Blizzard understands this. 
---
damn getting that as a rogue is huge

I would advise you against Leatherworking+Skinning. LW simply doesn't offer enough of useful gear to be worth it. Get two gathering profession to maximize gold income or mining+engineering, which will allow you to get guns+ammo and still allows some gold farming.
---
or will Classic characters be on the WoW armory?
---
What a valuable resource. Thanks so much!
---
Short answer: level as feral, or level resto if you want with a group but you'll just kill things slower if you're soloing (not impossible to kill something as a resto kitty with proper damage gear).
---
So even looking at your talents in the resto tree how much of it really makes you a "healer"?  you have your entire kit there.  you get some mana regen (15% so not a ton), .5 sec faster on your healing touch.  and it isn't until the end of the tree do you get +10% healing.  
---
Some quick math: if you rush down resto, you will get to the +10% healing by about level 34. By then you will have:
---
&gt;Rejuv (Rank 6): Heals for 306  (With +10% healing it's 336)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Healing Touch (Rank 6): Heals for 742 to 894.  (With +10% healing it's 816 - 983)  
---
&gt;Regrown (Rank 4): Heals 318 to 360 and another 343 over 21 seconds. (349 - 396 + 377)
---
So there really aren't HUGE changes in the numbers for that.  But are that same level you will be just starting the heart of the wild talent for +20% intellect.  so you'll have a bigger mana pool.   So if you just throw on some int / +healing gear (if you have any at that level, even if it's cloth) you will be able to heal just fine. the resto talents wont make or break a pull.  they might make things a tiny bit easier but overall the numbers are still very close.
---
The reason you swap to resto for raids is because of the healing optimizations involved that if you're healing end game anyway you might as well go into resto.  But for MC, you technically \*CAN\* heal the raid just fine as feral.  It would just be sub-optimal but it wouldn't put you at like 50% of what you would have been at as resto.  you'll just lose out on the mana regen, nature swiftness, +healing (since 10% of +healing in addition is base healing adds up).

---
I mean, the point of the last part is no one was playing in 4k in Vanilla, so if its going to be authentic 100% then it 'shouldnt' be allowed now.
---
Im in no way advocating for that, but if 100% authenticity is required, large resolutions shouldnt be allowed.
---
And when classic wow has better numbers than retail, you think investors will ignore it?
---
Hearthstone also started as a passion project.
---
Right now they simply don't believe anyone will pay for classic wow, they can't see the writing all the wall in front of their faces. When the numbers are in from the first quarter of classic being released "the people" who think the investors wont immediately start making demands will be proven pretty stupid.
---
I know practically nothing about add-ons so am looking forward to hearing what people say about this.
---
Actually only played WoTLK until Uduar, after cleaning it I stoped playing. Ulduar was great, even the boring first boss
---
IMO the fact that they specifically describe how they've reconstructed the old drop tables and will update them along side the AQ phase, but make no mention of item stats is pretty telling. We'll have to wait and see but I'm not expecting it.
---
Classic will run on a modified 7.3.5 client.
---
So your best bet are Legion add-ons if you want to get add-ons day 1.
---
There WILL be problems with many of them since the data is completely different from Legion, and the code has been altered.
---
I highly doubt most private server add-ons will work.
---
I'll give it 2-3 months after launch so that people can convert existing add-ons for Classic and check after that.
---
Agreed. I find the new animations are far too animuuu.
---
Admittedly, I play shaman.  I was only trying to list spells that get used in combat though, and I don't think paladins aura swap (correct me if I'm wrong).  Paladins are the best at spamming heals though.  Flash of Light is sooooo efficient.
---
Never had a world drop in OG vanilla (except for eye of shadow that I farmed for a friend). 
---
Although I did get a Flurry Axe to drop in STV on Nostalrius. That server was super populated and I was fighting other players for mobs for quests (the nagas near Booty Bay). That sucker made me rich when I sold it in the AH.
---
I put points into all three trees until 40ish when somebody casually told me I had to pick a single tree first.
---
It's all private server Bull Shit
---
did u have enchanting? just to disenchant the blues
---
I dont think that is technically true because the server caps were bumped up later on in Vanilla weren't they? It's not something we have heard confirmation on but I would hope for a pop cap of around 3500 to 4000, at least on pvp servers. 
---
Those "bot" features were in Vanilla and existed at the time.  That IS the original experience and it's disappointing to see they think it's worth patching out with different API.
---
I don't know if the average guild will be that harsh on them but we will see. either way, that is even better for collecting gear.
---
&gt; The truth is, hunter is one of the most skill-intensive classes in WoW in both PvP and raiding, and you can immediately tell a good hunter from a bad hunter if you know where to look.
---
you can say that about every single class. Anyone that has played pvp hunter. Ummmm yeahhhh
---
The chaotic evil in me wants to see this though!
---
It is when hiding in Stranglethorn Vale lol.
---
&gt;Now I have heard that most of the time its more effective to just grind mobs, cause of the long travel distances and the amount of xp quest give.
---
Not really accurate. If you grind all the time, you're basically turning down free xp from quests. Just try to grind your way from one questing spot to the next. 
---
Additionally, quests can be fun, and break up the monotony that grinding would otherwise consist of. 
---
Moving shaman to DW was a huge disappointment in TBC. Vanilla and TBC are just loaded with beautiful iconic 2handers that end up as mostly vanity items or hunter stat sticks due to how much better DW scales. Really wish they'd have tweaked mechanics rather than move them to DW.
---
*Gods we were strong then*
---
My pserver experience has always been miserable in leveling zones. After like lvl 12 or so I saw no real issues except in the barnes though. 
---
Yeah I had mining and enchanting at the start. I didn't yet understand the superiority of engineering. I did eventually drop enchanting way before it was leveled and took engineering. It was a gold loss overall but that was patch 2.0
---
He never said strict healing, and he's right. Priest, druid, and shaman all have skills that will decrease your big heal cast time very early in their respective healing trees. These skills can make dungeon healing much easier, so picking them up before going into your dps tree is a reasonable plan.
---
Lots of low level dungeon gear got upgraded over time, like defias sword and other boss items in deadmines were green originally.
---
get and update the right set of gear (mostly +int) and you will be fine
---
Private server addons are not compatible with the Classic client, as it is based on the Legion/BFA client. New addons will have to be made, as it's possible that even retail addons might need to be tweaked to work correctly with the Classic UI and stuff.
---
I just see those pictures of people waiting in line on Nost launch day and cringe. It looks like the worst possible vanilla experience. 
---
I dunno, I love LW on druids, particularly if you're playing up their hybrid angle. You'll need a tank set, dps set, healer set, and solo set. Quest gear is helpful, but for so many quests you want to take every option. And as a druid you get value out of all the random spirit they stapled onto crafted gear.
---
Hurricane, it dropped off some mob in Winterspring I think, don't remember which one exactly.
---
Vanilla is ruined! /s
---
So a little bit of context: I was 8 years old at the time, playing on my dad's account, the whole concept of gaming and especially the Warcraft universe was still relatively new to me, not to mention that English is not my native language and at the time I barely knew anything more than a few words like "me" and "hello". 
---
My first character was a Night Elf Warrior, I managed to get it to around level 8 before I entered Darnassus for the first time, after exploring a little bit, I saw a Druid shapeshifting in and out of his forms near the bank and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world and wanted to be able to do it myself, so I logged out and asked my dad to help me make my new character that can turn into animals. So, I made a Paladin. I very vividly remember getting to level 16 on my Paladin and asking people all over the place where do I get the quest to turn into a bear, it was an embarrassing moment for sure, especially because of how poor my English was and I applaud the people who even managed to understand what I was asking them. No idea how or why I thought Paladins had the ability to shapeshift, but that is the biggest "oh god I'm an idiot" moment I can think of, and also happened to be the start of my journey since I continued to main that Paladin all the way until Cataclysm when I rerolled to Rogue, and then later on in Legion to a Demon Hunter. 
---
get to 60 first, most people will need months to do so
---
idiots are fantasizing about hundreds of level 2's charging through starting zones to engage in mass pvp.
---
This is all private server talk though...
---
Dude, most people seem to enjoy your maps. Ignore the whiny naysayers, post your maps in peace.
---
I think the opinion is more nuanced than that for some.  The first half of wrath - leveling up, Naxx, and especially Ulduar and the hard modes - were in the vintage of old style WoW and excellent content.  The second half - ToC, ICC 5 mans with ridic gear, 10 man ICC, LFD, etc. - was the harbinger of what was to come.  At least that’s how I see it.  Ulduar was a masterpiece.
---
Yeah I was gonna say, I didn't recognize that sword the mage was wielding.  
---
Nothing will beat the first time, but it will be better than anything since 2006.
---
small world! what was your char name? I would like to see if they are on warcraftrealms, maybe we had mutual friends
---
&gt;  retail game time just to get used too a keyboard and mouse again.
---
&gt; After 3 years of not playing on PC I'm very rusty
---
Question, I know that retail and vanilla are 2 totally different beasts, but, could you (or, anyone) use retail as a way to re-familiarize myself with the controls before vanilla launches? If that's the case then I may resub as well a month before launch and do just that. 
---
thanks! 
---
These pictures you're claiming to have seen, were they in the starter zones?
---
Dude I just built my PC and I am READY FOR IT.
---
More like Keylith from Critical Roll! We felt like golden gods and quickly bit off more than we could chew and died. A lot. It took us a while to learn our limits as the "power curve" for us wasn't gradual.
---
Enjoy it! Druids in general may be the most fun in the game. 
---
I'm sorry, I wanted to post this in a thread about hunters. LW can be useful for druids.
---
Add this and you’ll quickly run out of quests. May as well grind more in a group to get that extra xp to make up for the xp lost by grouping
---
It’s authentic though. The 1.12.2 client supports it. 
---
They don't have stable technology, even sharded zones lag and desync with 80+ players... They need to fix that or world pvp and AV are going to be a shit show
---
We are talking about a 14 year old memory so forgive me for one small minor inaccuracy :p However I’m sure the pet didn’t attack until the enemy mob hit me. 
---
I had no idea this was even a thing.
---
Make that four

---
Yeah, it was Durotar at the scarlet crusade base, at the lockbox on the roof. 
---
For real, this post is so damn bad. At least title it "old promotional picture" or something not so pandering
---
Tab serpent sting, tab serpent sting, tab serpent sting.
---
No one levels as a healer because leveling dungeons can be healed as a DPS spec. You simply have two gear sets. Healers are some of the EASIEST classes to level.
---
Tier 1 leveling would be the two pet classes and druid. These classes all level stupidly fast and are also VERY strong at pvp during leveling. 
---
Tier 2 would be priest (use a wand and no downtime), Shaman pretty much the same with a fast dagger and shield. 
---
Tier 3 levelers would be Warrior, Rogue, Paladin in that order. Paladin is in no way hard it just has more downtime than tier 2. They also get a free mount and are stupidly strong in wpvp and can easily find a dungeon group as a healer, tank. Same could be said of Warrior. Rogues have a hard time getting in instances but stealth is nice on a pvp server for leveling. So even the "bad " leveling classes are not all doom and gloom.
---
If you are wondering where mages are it's tricky. If you wait a bit to level they are tier 1. If you level ahead of everyone they are tier 1. If you delay they are probably a bit under tier 2. It all has to do with aoe leveling.
---
I strated only in burning crusade, but as a druid I got my epic flying form (with the tons of hours I spent doing dailies in order to pay for the mounting skill) before I got my aquatic form. When I was done with the 280% flying form I told my friends “hey that’s strange although I have the new form, I still have a Druid quest” and that was about getting the two necklaces for the aquatic form...

---
Flasks go from 75g to 150, maybe 200g.  More than that, its a ripoff
---
I certainly don't remember a lot of bot-like add-ons. Among the popular add-ons, Decursive is probably the closest that I'm aware of.
---
IMO I think it's a fair argument to say that the original 1.12 API plus the sophistication of modern add-on developers can potentially lead to a very different experience. At the end of the day, it's the experience that matters, not the underlying implementation. So if they can mimic add-on experience in Vanilla using the modern API and artificial boundaries I'm not going to worry about it too much.
---
Then again, I've always been a minor add-on user. Necessary raid add-ons, minor UI tweaks, etc. So it probably isn't going to affect me whichever way they go.
---
Does it fold right into the wall?
---
My comment was short.  I agree with your raid breakdown.  When I say Beginning, I don't mean level cap beginning.
---
By "Beginning" I mean the transition from BC, leveling, story, the fun new 5Mans with their fresh mechanics, and the initial new systems like achievements before that got convoluted.  As well as getting to Dalaran for your first time before portals made it easy.
---
Again, at level cap, that's where there is some good and bad, like ICC and TOC respectively.
---
Skullflame shield when duoing npcs in LBRS after group disbanded. Never gotten a world epic on live servers, on emulators I believe it was on my 11 or 12th run to 60 (Kang).
---
Hence the night elf hunter in the back 
---
I leveled a shaman and hunter to 30 on a private server. Granted it was one server, but my experience is the vast majority of players will stick around until their party members are either done, or somebody new comes along to replace them who can help.
---
I did indeed encounter some selfish people who hogged quest drops and bailed. One of them bitched me out and raged hard at me in pm when I mentioned it and denied that the quest drops weren't sharable lol.
---
As others pointed out, a lot of quests in vanilla are designed for solo play. But as I said, I encountered a lot of people who were happy to share quest drops or stick around and help you finish getting yours as well. On the grossly overpopulated server I played on I would have to say all in all this specifically wasn't an issue. Whatever problems I experienced because of overpopulation, most people were willing to group for quests and share quest drops.
---
Isnt it just that ignite didnt take up extra debuff slots, so the first mage applies the ignite and it has that mage as source
---
Then 2nd mage casts fireball, and the ignite doesnt get overwritten nor a new one added, it just adds dmg to first one which still has first mage as source. Since dmg meters just check which mage is the source of the dmg, the first mage will get all the dmg?
---
Im not sure if the remaining time gets overwritten, and i might be completely wrong. Correct me.
---
Actually he does ;-)
---
Don't be sad though, I started playing on pservers to get familiar again and I made all the rookie mistakes again because my 14 year old memory was just as clogged.
---
I wore Circle of Flame on my Firemage from BRD until... TBC.
---
Sure, I put on my Tier/PvP helm when I really needed the stats, but 99% of the time I rocked that sweeeet sweet looking fire helm because it was my unique calling-card - had so many messages asking where I got it. Looked fucking incredible with the Warlord shoulders.
---
It comes with a toilet side-mount
---
Skinning is so easy to level, there’s no point on going out of your way to learn it early.  
---
Yeah. I've mulled over the idea of shared quest drops, but this is the same conclusion I reached. Vanilla was, by design, a grindy game.
---
Another factor is population. I played on a high pop pserver and competition got pretty fierce for resources and grouping was common. If we get vanilla-like server populations it may not be an issue *at all*.
---
Lol have you played resto Druid ?
---
While it's true for the shadow form, the chicken form from the balance three is pure garbage
---
First KT kill will be less than 3 hours.
---
I think I will play it less, but enjoy my playtime more.
---
It was definitely a real thing in Vanilla.

I searched youtube for druid tanking videos.  I was only able to find 2 that were 12 years old of a druid tanking.

So everything redditers are talking about druid tanks is from private server experience, not Vanilla game infrastructure.  
---
There are plenty of WoW videos from 12 years ago...but only 2 for Druid tanking...and nothing I would call a guild main tank performance.
---
So the real issue is how fast they decide to release each wave of content.  “Most” people will not be 60 before Dire Maul releases - if the game runs as true to vanilla as possible.  
---
That doesn’t take into account people’s knowledge of the game, and how many leveling add-ons are effective so more people will get to 60 faster.  I don’t remember any really amazing quest helper add-ons till tbc honestly.  
---
I think this might mean fewer pallies and locks at launch, which is fine by me ;)
---
Because in every private server this is what happens, people raid log. I hope real classic will be different!
---
For raiding, you will most likely end up wearing a dress and healing, as pally.
---
Depends on class.
---
A lot of ppl will claim joanas guide is king but it's a hunter guide. And its garbage for most classes besides warlock. So for 2 classes that may be true.
---
For rogue I grind 95% from 30-60.
---
Maintaining 30-40k xph. None of which is from whelps.
---
This is where I'd like to hear from others what the xph is while questing. I can tell you as a rogue if I quest while leveling vs grinding. My xph gets cut down by 50%. Sometimes 25%
---
This is only useful if you can stomach 16-18 hour straight or grinding
---
The add-ons didn't exist but the tools to create them did.  Seems wrong to say "that goes against game intent" when that's probably false because the possibility of doing it existed then.
---
I played on a pserver with updated models for playable races, NPCs, and mobs. Looked pretty sharp, especially with tiling textures replaced with recolored Legion textures, and some trees replaced with their later updated versions.
---
In an interview somebody (I think it was Brack) stated updated graphics was something they were trying to decide on and would consider community feedback, but I personally think they likely won't bother.
---
I would like to see a graphics toggle if and only if vanilla graphics are the default setting and the toggle actually works without breaking anything. I think maintaining the vanilla aesthetic is more important.

People are going to tell you that if you don't level as a non-healing spec that you're doomed to slog and suffer. Those people are wrong. While yes, if your goal is to speed level grind it out solo, the specs to accomplish this are well understood. However, leveling as a healer has a few other advantages.
---
Particularly, you get to play how you want to play from lvl 10, not from lvl 60. If you've got a raiding guild waiting for you and you've leveled a bunch of times, sure that extra 10% or whatever speed difference will matter. However if you're leveling for the experience, I'd rather play the game the way I wanted to play it.
---
I also like leveling as my intended end-game spec because you incorporate the skills you'll have into your play style and do not become dependent on other skills you won't have at 60. I don't want to become dependent on Silence as a priest if I know I'm going holy. Similarly, I'd like to develop the reflex to reach for Nature's Swiftness if I know I'm going to have it rather than relearn how to play at 60. 
---
Then there's the social aspects. Your spec is a large part of your identity in vanilla. People come to know you as a healer spec, which can help for getting group and guild invites.
---
The healing trees are not bad as people make it out to be. Somebody did some analysis of how the extra +10% healing you get deep in the tree doesn't matter, and he's right, but that same line of reasoning applies to the extra +10% damage you get, it's kinda lost in the wash and more relevant in longer raid and instance fights. Meanwhile, nearly every healing spec has some talents to help you out leveling. Shaman can take Nature's Grace which is one of the best talents in the game. Increased totem range and Totemic Focus help you make better use of your powerful totems, Nature's Swiftness will prevent Deaths, and even Mana Tide is useful when grinding since you can just keep going longer. Meanwhile over in Enhancement, you'll rarely even use Storm Strike simply because of how inefficient it is.
---
And then, because it's vanilla, you can swap trees while leveling, you don't need to commit to a single one. So take druid, you can put your first 5 points into Ferocity for a boost to your feral solo ability, then jump back to resto. Or you can even go deeper, 13 points into feral for feral charge and feline swiftness which is a huge speedup to your leveling, then swap back into resto. Paladin has a similar build. 13 points into Ret for SoC and PoJ, then back over to holy, where you can even pick up a nice dps boost in the first tier with +10% strength. Priests only need imp wand spec and Spirit Tap for leveling, after that not much else matters in the grind.
---
If you're attitude towards leveling as a healer is to just deal with it, then yeah it can suck, but if you embrace it it can be fun and effective.
---
Read moar
---
Holy Paladins can’t farm for shit. What you can do is play BGs and farm professions. 
---
I know the feeling, I got WW axe at level 31 on my latest warrior and all the sudden I had over 2x the damage as before (but I still had to level weap skill.. cringe).  All the sudden I'm like "I can certainly pull 5 at once, what can go wrong?!"!
---
I wish it had been a choice/spec-based thing like 2h being a PvP spec, like how Warriors were in Vanilla. Or even how they did with Fury Warriors where you could DW 1h or 2h. I mean, I feel like to take away the ability for a Shaman to swing a huge 2h weapon is such a tragedy - I mean they had to spec into it anyway to show only a niche of them can even carry the weapons.
---
One huge problem with DW vs 2h is the weapon buffs. Having 2x Mongoose proc vs 1x is pretty big over the course of the raid, and I'm not sure how to balance around that.
---
Go the pserver route--make a digitally signed official "mod" that can be downloaded and overwrite the appropriate database files, models, and textures. It would require closing the client to patch then re-launching to install or revert, but it shouldn't cause problems like the toggle option did in the retail client.
---
A level 28 blue with +4str and +4stam
---
That sweet, sweet gold.
---
Probably a lot less because I will not have the same amount of spare time I could commit to it.
---
I had just started college when it came out. Then, I had all of the free time in the world and I spent the majority of it playing WoW.  Now, I have a demanding career and 2 babies to take care of. I plan on taking a couple days off of work to play at launch but after that....? Who knows when I can fit it in. 
---
Normally you level in a DPS spec. If you save healing gear you find through the leveling process, you can main heal leveling dungeons fine.
---
Not sure which is more obsolete, this thread or my comment on it.
---
They were more advanced and had more options in Wrath/TBC. Who knows of that's better though.
---
Yeah, okay, I see...
---
But no.
---
Now you can't hide. Let the slaughter begin!
---
better is the same as easier, meaning the entire game would have to be changed to hold the same level of difficulty, such as adding an expansion to the game of some sort 
---
You can heal within 10% of peak efficiency in raids with just 20 points in holy for 5/5 illumination. So you could run holy/ret 20/31 (or 21/30 if you value divine favor over repentance) to be more effective when solo.
---
TBA 
---
You know what's going to happen? They're going to drop a massive update or start beta and you're going to be hyped again. That's what's going to happen.
---
[Circle of Flame](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11808), BRD
---
Dropped for my mage in my mid-50's, equipped that badboy for almost the entirety of vanilla and kept it in my bags until I quit the game at the end of TBC.
---
Of course you skip doomweed in any launch situation. But expecting someone to go to mulgore in hopes of there being slightly less people is just silly. (Can you evem do that? Doubt it) 
---
When you're at the point where it's 
---
even possible to make a decision about where you level there's no reason for sharding anyway. I'm talking about durotar/mulgore/tirisfal/teldrassil/etc. 
---
They also stated that gameplay comes first.  Visual effects and bugs are lowest on the list of priorities.  But, of all the possible changes I agree it would definitely help with the nostalgia warm and fuzzy if the environment effects were true to vanilla.  
---
Thank you for your rebuttal to my point
---
A great place is BlackRock stronghold in burning steppes. Low armor and lots of casters. Tones of runecloths and might rage recipe drops off these mobs
---
Wait for sharding to be disabled then, so that you can level through 1-6 with full non-sharding breathtaking immersion. Then everyone is happy.
---
Ok, so like Korall said, why are you here?
---
if Fanaticism &gt; Might for that spec
---
"Massive two handed" - has Taran Icebreaker equipped, one of the fastest two handers in the game.
---
It's a great weapon, but I think my biggest issue with it is it sits at an awkward level.   Most warriors are going to have and want to use WW axe at this point.  Most paladins are going to have and want to use Verigan's Fist at this point.  Hunters don't get a huge use out of melee weapons in general, and I can't speak for shamans.
---
Okay, Paladin is the simplest healer in Raids due to their rotation of spam FoL rank 3-5 depending on mana pool and occasionally a Divine Favor paired with a Holy Light if someone just got fucked hard. 
---
If you are a raid healer, you need 30 points in holy. There's no way around it, you will be suboptimal and outperformed by every other paladin if you don't. If you want to be a raid healer, you will need a dps set and probably respec often if you would like to solo farm. It helps to befriend someone like a mage or warrior and duo farm with them.
---
If you are only interested in dungeon healing or pvp healing, there is a lot more leeway. Shockadin isn't the greatest and you really don't need it in any spec. 20 or 21 in holy will get you by as a healer outside of raids. You could easily rock a reckbomb pvp spec with that much in holy, or split it with ret or traditional prot for aoe farming.
---
Most raid healers on progressive content have to sacrifice their solo play
---
&gt; One huge problem with DW vs 2h is the weapon buffs. Having 2x Mongoose proc vs 1x is pretty big over the course of the raid, and I'm not sure how to balance around that.
---
Make it proc 2x as much on 2handers, or .5x on DW?
---
Mark of the dragon Lord ring from LBRS. Won it on my mage from a priest, despite being a more a healer item. I was so happy at first to see a purple on me, but then I was  feeling bad because I realized that mp5 is not a priority for mages.
---
I was raiding MC with that ring..
---
Its helping me with that. Not each ability but how my bind layout best fits my hands and weather or not I can live with my new 6 button mouse vs my old 10 button. It was 108k gold and I used to no life farm so it wasn't a big deal for me.
---
This is a list of the CCs removed by the PVP trinkets each class has - for example the priest PVP trinket will remove fear, stun and polymorph while the shaman PVP trinket removes stun, root and slow.

Some of the values are off here and there but it's the best tool I've found so far. 
---
I'm trying to think of what raid you would make that would make sense. What new areas would be added or revamped. 
---
Glowing Brightwood Staff. Dropped of some NPCs in AV when I was collecting armor scraps for turn ins. Sold it on the AH for a pretty penny which helped fund my epic mount. 
---
This is cool
---
What they are releasing right now is the base game without expansions.
---
Blizzard haven't said anything about releasing TBC servers, or any of the other expansions yet. One can speculate about it, but until Blizz confirms it for us, we simple don't know.
---
If you don't know what you want you're best getting reds. I love my blues though. 
---
From a game-design perspective, I think it's hard to argue TBC wasn't far superior to Vanilla in terms of class balance.  I think the failed specs like Ret and Balance in Vanilla were more a result of the team figuring things out as they went, whereas with TBC it was clear that they were aiming for a certain level of viability for almost any talent specialization.  TBC might have done some things wrong, but in my personal opinion, the level of balance and viability across all specs made it the pinnacle of WoW's existence.
---
Now, having said that, I still don't think that makes a case for rebalancing Classic.  The point of this whole project is to recreate the game as it was then, for better and/or for worse.  Maybe in 5-10 years, if there's interest, it will be worthwhile to discuss Classic TBC servers, and maybe open up a dialogue as to how they can fix some of the things it started to do wrong, but for now it's far too premature for that discussion to hold any water.
---
Same as anyone else. Stupid question. Classic WoW is same for me as for anyone else here.  
---
Or is it r/webelieveeverythingblizzardsays ?
---
Even without sharding there won’t be be 1k players in Elwynn.
---
ITT: people like OP wanting changes to retail affecting Classic despite the fact that they are different games. 
---
OP even wants to add XP to BGs, what a joke. If you don’t like it, don’t queue for BGs. 
---
You don’t know shit about hunter dps in raids, they are not bottom raid dps. It’s a meme from private servers where melle and casters are overpowered from countless broken bugs, talents and mechanics .
---
Topre
---
Yes, we're called Alliance rogues fighting orcs 
---
i bought the game three times before finally sticking to it
---
the first time i made a shaman but went too fast to barrens and all the mobs were too strong for me so i was like.. meh fuck it and sold my fresh account
---
the 2nd time i made a rogue but quickly realized they needed stealth so i thought they were in stealth the entire game. 
---
so i was like.. meh fuck it and sold my fresh account for the 2nd time 
---
3rd time i bought the game i made a hunter and around level 33ish  i discovered pvp and i had a knack for it. 
---
then i as hooked and i have been playing wow ever since.. 
---
lost a girlfriend here and there because of it .. but at least valentinsday is cheap. 
---
It’s doable for a few fights but overall it’s useless 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Classic and BFA aren't the same game, and they aren't handled by the same teams. I can understand concern or optimism (depending on how you view twinking) at something like this, but realistically just because twinks are segregated in BFA doesn't mean that change will be retroactively applied to classic.
---
Blizz recognized a lot of things from the vanilla/tbc/wrath design philosophy as "problematic" that will nonetheless be restored for classic. I doubt they are going to change this.
---
On other end I was ultra hardcore in retail and no lifed it, this time I want a balanced experience.
---
right? I'm gonna replace it soon anyway. I'd rather the gold for my mount.
---
Stockade Pauldrons from a spider in EPL :]

It's mostly just fun to speculate "what if" scenarios. I don't think most people seriously expect it to happen. I like to talk updated graphics, but I will be happy without them, I just like talking about it. Just as an example. I like talking transmog, too, even though I'm adamantly opposed to it actually appearing in any capacity in Classic for gameplay/economy reasons.
---
It's just fun.
---
There are always alternatives. Even in Tirisfal Glades, aside from the quest mobs and quest areas, there are mobs peppered throughout the entire zone. All the starter zones are like this. You can walk in any random direction and there are mobs to kill.
---
Also, +95% of Horde tend to go to the Barrens (undead/tauren) or they just stay in the Barrens (orc/troll) where they can instead go to Silverpine Forest, the same level range zone, South West of Tirisfal.
---
Once you get to Orgrimmar as an Orc or Tauren or whatever, you can get on the Zeppelin and very easily go to UC -&gt; Silverpine Forest. There are lots of quests, lots of mobs, a flight path, and even a dungeon there.
---
I've played in many fresh server scenarios, both retail Vanilla and pservers, and Silverpine Forest is always extremely low density compared to the Barrens. Even if they unfortunately shard the game, it would be a good idea to go there.
---
This is just one example of the many alternatives there are.
---
It's more that on short fights DW has the potential proc both weapons, while 2h can only have one buff active. Making one proc twice as much or one half as much won't fix that.
---
Never chill. Only win.
---
That's outside the Valley of Trials, so it shouldn't be sharded anyway.
---
Or will it? Will they shard Razor Hill? Will they shard the entirety of Durotar? Orgrimmar is in Durotar, where will the sharding end?
---
The quietest ones.
---
I know there's a lot of love for the sharp feel of mechanical actuation and the clickety-clack sound that accompanies it, but you're going to be spamming *a lot* of buttons playing WoW.
---
Imagine raiding as a Frost Mage, spamming Frostbolt for 2 hours straight.  God help you if you have roommates or live with anyone else, the constant CLACKCLACKCLACKCLACKCLACKCLACKCLACKCLACKCLACK would probably cause them to stab you one day.

[][][] #FORTNITE  Me and my son have always had an up and down relationship. I think this is due to us not really have much in common, its hard for us to bond. He is a huge fortnight fan, and his mother made him a John Wick costume for Halloween (His favorite skin). He was beyond happy. He really loves Fortnight. I took Halloween as an opportunity to bond with him more, so without him knowing I had his mother make me a fortnight costume to surprise him. I scrolled through google looking at different skins and eventually decided to go as what they call "Rust Lord". The outfit seemed easy to put together and it had a bad ass feel to it. I even researched some of the more popular dances (The Floss, Best Mates, and Orange Justice) I spent hours learning these 3 dances, I don't consider myself all that coordinated but after some time I felt I had them down perfectly. Halloween night came and my son went out trick or treating with his friends. As they were out I put on my costume before handing out candy to the kids. I was surprised with the amount of kids that recognized my costume, I was a hit. Until this group of kids, dressed up as skeletons, I guess they are called skull troopers nowadays? I dont know, looked like skeletons to me. Anyway, what seemed to be the leader of the group didn't seem impressed with my costume, he actually seemed bothered. In a demeaning tone before even getting any candy he asked if I could floss. That smirk on his face turned into full blown surprise as I dropped the bowl of candy, and put every bit of energy into the best floss I could muster up. I nailed it. Surprised but still unimpressed the leader said not bad, but lets see your orange justice. I don't know what came over me but I completely blanked, he caught me off guard despite my hours of preparation. I couldn't let this 10 year old alpha me so I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and started flailing around like an inflatable tube man caught in a hurricane. I finished my dance, and silence followed for what seemed to be an eternity. Next thing I know it the group of skeletons erupted into laughter and started jumping left to right while holding their hand in an L shape formation. I was embarrassed, I slammed the door and I kid you not, thought about crying at that very moment. My man hood compromised by a group of young children, but that wasn't even the worst of it. 20 minutes later my doorbell rings, which is strange considering I turned off the porch lights after that embarrassing incident. I turn the light back on, opened the door, and my jaw dropped. a Group of what seemed to be 50+ characters gathered across my lawn all jumping left and right with simultaneously while forming the L shape with their hands. I yelled at the kids, slammed the door and ripped off my costume. What have I done. 30 minutes later my son comes home and I guess word travels quickly in a small community, he already knew what happened. He didn't even make eye contact with me, I tried asking how trick or treating went and he ignored me, went up to his room and slammed the door. He hasn't talked to me since last night and I really don't know what to do.. I don't think he respects me anymore. homer sexual got him  me parents are fuqin nonces they like putting "RULES" on legit everything i wanna get its dumb so for example i buy headphones rules will be put in place for the headphones wanna buy a game they will put rules on that like a couple mins ago i asked for a legit credit card and there like NAH youll have restrictions and im like shut the fuck up youve already put rules on my phone, laptop, most shit i own and i dont even listen to the rules cos there that fucking stupid like one rule for my phone is "dont bring your phone to any place except home and school" like what type of gayass bullshit is that but ofc i dont listen then there like O_O and try to fuck me then i make them realise just how reBarded the rules they make are. Basically, frICK my fortnite....d.as.d.   MOMO MOMO MOMO MOMO MOMO TIDE POD MOMO People have been sending me this! Why??? I'm honestly feeling in danger right now... This makes me feel very unsafe.

We don’t know if they are temporarily increasing caps. We don’t know if the amount of players joining will exceed the amount of players leaving, we don’t have any method of finding out whether it is the case, nor what that ratio would be other than by launching the game and looking at the data after the fact.

That mid-parachute shooting was awesome. It feels like it could have been a Warcraft 3 ability. On death, Gyrocopter pilots deploy a parachute and become lesser marksmen for 300 gold and 250 wood.

We have dps logs from actual vanilla fights showing hunters are the lowest pure dps class after a certain point in progression.

I'm thinking of doing enchanting and engineering, at least at 60, so I can farm DM/Princess and then just use the cash for mats. If the gold/hr is as lucrative as people say, it seems like the best option

You don't have FB in 29 so that didn't happen.  Also, because of that, blood frenzy wasn't worth very much, a proc was worth ~+55dmg over 12 seconds. Also also, feline swiftness wasn't op; shamans beat you and hunters tied you. 
---
Viable =/= ideal. Some privates have bear offtanks up to Naxx, and I've seen people doing some insane shit with feral DPS because we've learned so much about the game since 2005. Yes, Warriors are better tanks, and Druids are *best* as resto but if you really push yourself you can make the others work. Hell, there was even a guild running a boomkin in Naxx. 
---
Druid tank can be pretty good to even better than a warrior, depending on gear/boss. However it needs a good amount of knowledge to work. Tell them to read up some of the guides and they should be fine.
---
I've been watching a lot of em actually. Love the depth he goes into, I'll definitely be checking into em again around launch 
---
Why was the bear removed?

My computer used to be in our bedroom and I couldn't stay up and do *anything* on it because the fucking keyboard would keep my husband awake lol.

That's the biggest thing I think my SO and I will struggle with. We're playing Secret World Legends now, but they give you....like 5ish abilities you can use at a time so your bindings are limited which is NOT how Classic is (seeing how you can potentially have a few dozen key bindings depending on your role and what have you). 
---
But cool, I may give it a try then once the time comes, thanks! 
---
&gt;I’m gonna replace it soon anyway. I’d rather the gold for my mount.
---
Did you actually play vanilla? Blues (especially in the pre-mount levels) lasted you for like 10 levels in most cases—definitely not replacing it soon lol
---
No changes
---
I'm going to level a Warrior first.  I figure it will definitely have it's downsides, cost-wise, but if you can stick with it the rewards ought to be nice.
---
I'm not going to play hardcore or rush by any means, but I do expect to be level 60 relatively fast compared to most players simply by virtue of having lots of time to play.  As an early level 60 Warrior who *wants* to tank instead of DPS, I'll probably be a super popular guy when it comes to running 5/10 mans to gear up.  And hey, if that means I can play the role of diva a little bit and get things like my UBRS key early on, I'm going to take advantage of it.  Especially since I won't be able to farm in the conventional ways that Mages and other classes do.
---
Read the tldr and if that makes you interested in anything this weirdo has to say you likely have brain damage. 
---
But I actually have a pretty open mind, my dude. If you can present to me reasons that time limited sharding in starter zones effects the long-term server community outside that sharding (which will eventually just not exist anymore), and that you're not just kneejerk reacting with no context at all, then I'm totally open to having my opinion changed for the better.
---
&gt; Scholomance was designed as a 5-man dungeon that you could bring 10 players to. It was never tuned to 10 people. The unintended spawning of too much trash was separate from this. Once it was discovered, it was patched out.

---
it is your opinion so be it. I will respect yours &amp; you respect mine. If you want to play unbalanced, unfair and rather broken game, so be it. 
---
It wasn’t 
---
yes I did and yeah they did last you 10 levels, but so did many questing greens. I didn’t replace some westfall greens until in my 30s. I would just rather get the blues from quests or dungeons and sell any boes I find to help with mount gold.
---
Also you need to remember that if you wanna crit chain lightning people's faces you have to respec from healing to Ele, because you're not going to be Ele in PVE.  So if you only plan on doing PVP and that's it, then sure Ele Shaman is super fun in PVP.  Trying to run an Ele/Resto hybrid all the time to PVE and PVP is going to be very iffy, and if your guild lets you do it, you're most likely being carried by others and not bringing your Shaman's full potential.
---
On the other hand, SM/Ruin is a main raid spec for Warlock, and it's fantastic in pvp as well, so you don't really have to worry about re-spec costs all of the time
---
You will start as a boy when levelling a Warrior and become a man by the end of it.

 Player looking for guild...
---
**EU Alliance - Norm but open to PVP** if its the right guild
---
**Main: Dwarf Priest, levelling as Disc, Holy at 60**  
---
*Alts: Nightelf Resto/Feral Druid, then Rogue (undecided on the race etc)*
---
**Available to raid:** Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. 6.30pm on wards BST (so -1 GMT), until 12am BST (-1 GMT)  
---
*I won't be able to commit to 4 days raiding, above are best days - 3 are best for me!*
---
**Priorities:** Raiding - social - PVP
---
**Professions:** At 50+ I'll be a Tailor, unsure of 2nd right now, likely to be Alchemist.
---
**Experience:** Played WoW for 14 years. Always tended to be Disc/Holy Priest, Resto Druid, Resto Shaman (along with many other alts). I have also play/ed FFXIV (healer), ESO (healer), GW2, SWL (healer), Neverwinter (healer), SWOTR (healer)... there's a theme, I love healing, I will always heal.
---
I've GMed before, and Officer'ed in several guilds over the years. I'm looking for a guild where I can take a similar role as Officer (or higher/lower) as really wanting to throw myself into Classic - why the heck not!? I do work during the day but I have the ability to keep up to date with the guild activity/needs throughout the day.
---
I work in Marketing, so happy to get involved with any channels the guild wishes to use, Discord, guild site, social media etc.
---
**UK based, 29 years old**
---
If anyone has a guild they feel I'd be a beneficial member of, please drop me a message
---
Thank you \^-\^
---
And all you can do is insult. Thank you for your invaluable contribution. 
---
Yeah people always thought pod enh shamans owned this bracket but soj ele shamans were way more dangerous. When battlegroups arrived there were 2 pod shamans and a pod warr I saw a lot and they weren't much trouble but an ele shaman got me almost every time.
---
&gt;  I, however, will play on 7680×4320 if such will be available, install all useful addons and roll **whatever** class/spec **I want**. 
---
This is the spirit. Too many people on here tend to get too fed up with how others are going to play this game. It's Classic, everyone should to whatever the f they want.
---
Warriors are better tanks for most bosses. But druids push much higher threat and overall damage whether they are (off-)tanking or dpsing in comparison to Prot Warriors.
---
I personally think it is ideal to have 1-2 offtank ferals not only because it makes your raid comp more well rounded and flexible but also because it is easier to equip everyone quicker like this, especially if you are running a melee heavy composition.
---
Keep in mind that alliance warlocks will have a big disasvantage in PvP as they won't be able to effectively use Fear on undead players.
---
We’ll see, I got top 5 in many aq/naxx bosses in retail. I plan on min maxing to an extreme degree in classic and posting results here.
---
You appear to be misunderstanding something. My anger is from the fact Blizzard invalidated my progression in Ulduar. 3.2 was released, well okay, guess I'm never fucking killing Algalon.
---
I don't care about anyone else. Just the fact that unless I play super hardcore I can't experience most of the content. Blizzard proceeded to "solve" this problem that they had created by Inserting LFR so that you can "see" all of the content. Most boring shit in the world. Destroys any kind of hype in reaching the content.
---
WoW since then has to devolved to what it is now. Clear the same bloody raid 3 times and call that progress. Now even as a 2 nights a week raider I feel zero fulfillment from clearing anything. Great job Blizzard.
---
I never managed to so much as clear one trash group in SWP, I never managed to kill Gurtogg or Archimonde. But God damn if that wasn't the most fulfilling raiding I ever had. When you faced down Kael'thas, you may be doing so months after anyone else, but god damn it you actually progressed towards him! And you couldn't wait to kill him knowing that MH and BT were waiting. Yeah, can't wait to kill Blackahnd Heroic so I can start reflecting BRF all over again.
---
My brain works. 
---
Nope, Mark Kern said in a ClassiCast that it was 100% a design decision and Kevin Jordan (one of the original developers) have confirmed as much. It all has to do with building a tight knit community where you recognize players, have rivalries.
---
It's one of the saddest things to have lost in modern WoW primarily because of cross realm technologies but also on private servers with mega populations up to 15k concurrent players. 
---
The authentic community focused social experience with smaller servers just isn't available anymore and it's the most important thing we get back.
---
I care
---
When you are not raiding, you can gather crafting materials, do quests in Eastern Plaguelands or Silithus, do battlegrounds, level your crafting professions, and do dungeons.
---
What can you farm on Paladin...you will have an easier time farming dungeons like Scholomance and Stratholme because you have abilities that do damage to undead. You will probably do UBRS a lot to get your healing trinket from Jed (He is a rare elite so it is annoying to get).
---
I recommend picking up mining and engineering if you want to do PvP. Grenades are very powerful for stopping enemies from capturing your flag. 
---
You can definitely heal dungeons as Ret. Just make sure you have healing gear and you should do fine assuming your tank is decent. Remember you can wear cloth, leather, and mail too. You may look terrible, but that is just how WoW vanilla is...also talk your tank into letting you repentence a mob so that the tank takes less damage. Being able to CC may be necessary for harder pulls. Also if you have another player who can rez in the group, if you ever do come to a wipe, be sure to tell the other rezzer to get to a safe spot so you can divine intervention. That would save a lot of time so they can rez the party and you don't have to all run back. It can confuse people tho, but if your team gets it then it can help a lot. 
---
Good PvP builds. Your best bet is to go Holy for PvP. A good healer can mean whether or not your team wins. Make sure you learn how to use line of sight effectively. Getting out of an enemy's line of sight will seriously help your survivability. Using holy shock as an instant heal while moving to another side of the wall will frustrate your enemy to no end.
---
Krol blade from slithilus grinding on my mage right before I dinged 60. Sold it for 100g
---
So you agree they last forever, then your “ill replace it soon anyways” comment is just not even relevant to your own experience? lmao what even was the point
---
That's kind of what I was thinking.  Might not make as much money or level as fast but people will always need me as tanks especially 50+ get rarer and rarer.  Hopefully will have a guild for support also for things like mats and stuff
---
And everyone will do whatever they want. Back in day, we all would go outside and talk to our friends about gear and classes in different games. We relied on their opinions. This is not the case anymore. 
---
Too obvious
---
Good for you. 
---
Haha I've heard that for sure and I'm definitely ready :)
---
People blow warrior leveling difficulty way out of proportion. As long as you don't want to be in the first wave of 60s you will not struggle much more than other classes.
---
Purchase potions on the auction house and do some dungeons now and then and you will be fine.
---
I think most would agree that TBC and Wraith were Blizz's peak in terms of class and spec balance. That being said, Classic simply wasn't designed with the additional spells and talents in mind. If you were to add those, you'd have to rebalance the entire game so much so that you're basically making it anew. 
---
There's already been a lot of talk about how the later itemization trivializes earlier content. I can't imagine how easy it would be if you added things from Wraith and TBC. Think about spells like vamp touch for shadow priest. The mana upkeep is such a massive game changer for casters that I can't even imagine it being used in a place like MC.
---
Yeah hots don't stack so you only use healing touch.
---
Your point?
---
Some of your points are fine - shift click to compare has absolutely no bearing on the game and will probably make it in.
---
Classes will not and should not be rebalanced so that everyone is on a level playing field. It would not be the same game. It completely changes the group dynamic. When you pick a class that's known to do good DPS you're accepting the fact that though you'll have an easier time putting out big numbers, you'll be competing for gear with far more people so it's going to take longer to hit your ceiling. If you take on a weaker class you're going to have to put in the extra work but there's going to be far less people to share the rewards with. It makes some classes/specs special in that regard and it's so much more interesting than "every class has the same base output". Some non-tryhard guilds will take on people with meme specs. Esfand is all the evidence you need that they can do just fine. 
---
There's no point moaning about it because it isn't going to happen, period. 
---
I'm just thinking of a lot of the players coming to Classic WoW will have been some who played many expansions and are even maybe up to date with Retail. These players are going to be magnitudes of levels better at mechanically playing the game then when they were just beginning in Vanilla. And if they had been doing any PvE content along the way, it would have demanded more mechanical skill. Just look at the % of players that backpedal in later expansions vs in Vanilla. No doubt the player skill has increased as you would expect it should in any game that people played for 10+ years.
---
You're correct that it's impossible to say. But just the same it's impossible to say that this was unprofessional. 
---
Agreed completely. I think TBC was the sweet spot, as pures still did more dps than hybrid dps specs individually, but hybrids brought extra utility and clutch offheals that made both pure and hybrid dps worth bringing. Raiding in TBC was truly sublime if you were playing with the right group, and you could play as your class fantasy of choice much more so than vanilla. 
---
That said, I preferred the world building of vanilla, as well as the fact that there was no overarching story like there was in TBC, there was just a world. Overall, it’s probably best to just leave vanilla alone as changes are a very dangerous slippery slope.
---
Gnomorgays wait shit
---
Shit, totally forgot to mention I'm going undead for either these classes.
---
Bloodrazor from one of the satyrs in Azshara.
---
&gt;If you want to play unbalanced, unfair and rather broken game, so be it.
---
That is exactly what I want. The game is supposed to be like it was 13 years ago or so. As close as it can be. It is not supposed to be anything else. The devs have said they want you to not notice a difference between classic and vanilla. 
---
I don't get why people can't seem to grasp this mindset. If I want to replay Final Fantasy VI I don't want to replay an "adjusted" version that completely changed everything around. I just want to experience the game how it was.
---
Interesting thoughts!
---
I was actually talking to a friend the other day about some of our favorite games.  We got to talking about the Final Fantasy 7 remake that's coming out, but based on what I know about it so far, I don't think I'll be buying it.  Gaming has changed!  People nowadays expect to be able to customize their characters looks.  People nowadays expect there to be an in-game cash shop where they can choose what dances and cosmetics their characters can do -- Floss-Dance crew represent!
---
I don't see the point of them keeping the story the same, either  --  EVERYONE KNOWS IT!  I think this remake is a good opportunity to make Sephiroth the hero of the story and have him kill Cloud at Niflheim.  And then once you get out into the open world as Sephiroth and crew, there should be Pokemon to catch... every game needs side-quests, it's 2019!!
---
Oh for sure I'm not so much daunted by the leveling aspect itself (I'll actually be doing herb/alch personally even though it's not the "correct" professions) I'm more worried about not having a mount at 40 and other such struggles haha
---
#nochanges as a concept is flawed by the fact that we all have a retrospective view on Classic and how to play it. 
---
That's when it went from an updoot to a no vote post for me.
---
It can be a long discussion topic, but tl;dr
---
Ferals can work. 
---
To make it work you need to invest a lot of dedication, knowledge and effort. If you are not minmaxing you fail, it is not a role for casual players. My bet is that 95% of feral wannabees are not ready to do that and will fail.
---
Best way is to not worry about it to start - addons will be available almost instantly, there are some super dedicated people out there.
---
You really are not missing much by spending the first few dozen hours /played without addons. Rest assured, there will be addons available, no need to fret. Just play the game and each time you think something like "having a swing-timer or a quest helper would be nice" - done. Saves from cluttering up too much, since I used to go through big bloated "recommended" addon packs, now I prefer a more customized and streamlined setup.
---
blues were suggested for me off the bat, so its what i went with.  IIRC theyre a bit more crisp/stiff, but hot damn typing on my blues feels good.
---
I actually ended up having to buy a keyboard for work, too.  Once i started using them at home i couldnt *stand* the stupid squishy HP keyboard i had at work &gt;_&lt;
---
So your telling me thunderfury wont be attainable until the 1.10 weapons come out?
---
What would you do
---
Why have I been downvoted. Hots don't stack so only one druid uses them
---
Abandon the quest and grind somewhere else
---
Inspect him and then beg for gold.
---
You need to ask for new monitors plus are you very short because those monitors should be raised.
---
This is something they so rarely bring up, yet its strange since its such a huge part to the world.
---
Really hope we see good weather, and that we see a intesity slider that actually works and makes for super intese weather.
---
Invite my Horde brother to a group.  Maybe he's there to help with the grind.
---
Go play retail m8
---
Yeah people don't usually recommend blues for games but they've been my favorite out of the 5 or so that I've owned. Only ones I don't care for are browns. 
---
I sincerely hope you are right, and maybe the hunters I raided with back in the day were bad. I just haven't seen or experienced any evidence that could make them capable of getting into the top dps spots assuming that everyone is playing optimally.
---
Who is complaining about colour blind mode? 
---
Serious pvp'ers go orc anyway.
---
If roommates/spouses/whatever are a concern, its a valid point.
---
That being said, i play with blues (which are pretty loud) and i never notice the noise while playing.
---
In raids/dungeons/whatever theres a good chance you'll have a headset on anyways, which is going to block a fair amount of it out.
---
While questing youre probably going to be more focused on what youre killing/how youre pulling, (or the TV, tbh), etc...and its really just not noticeable.
---
Also in my experience, just for things like moving and casting, youre actually hitting a lot less keys (fewer keystrokes) than when typing in chat, reddit, etc.  Theres just far fewer keystrokes required unless youre literally mashing the buttons 4 times every second.
---
Precisely Calibrated Boomstick and I was a Hunter. It dropped in Mara and they whole group passed on it because I was gonna use. 
---
I tried to trade them all gold for being nice and only 1 of them actually took any.
---
Here's how I see it. Classic is attempting a reasonably faithful recreation of vanilla WoW. Sure, gaming has changed, the MMO market has changed, etc. But if we all wanted to play a modern MMO we'd be playing one (some of us probably are). We *want* the clunky 13 year old mechanics because we genuinely enjoy that design philosophy as well, though.
---
"Fixing" class balance in vanilla is more problematic than I think you've considered. Some of the "nonviable" specs would be pretty OP factoring in other utility they bring. It would take constant tweaking and rebalancing until we hit a point of homogenized gameplay for the sake of balance that I experienced in the retail game as of WoD when I unsubbed.
---
I think people have made it very understandable and clear why they are against sharding. I get it if you simply do not share that opinion, but I just cannot see how you could be mystified as to why some people oppose the idea.
---
Nobody is seriously criticizing colorblind mode. Some trolls do, but they're trolling.
---
Discussion and opinions are all well and good, but some of the changes some people want to see are rather enormous and have huge impacts on gameplay, which decidedly undermines the purpose of this project and alienates a huge portion of its target audience. Those who want the vanilla storyline and such might do better to petition for vanilla zones to be added (via Chromie or something) to the modern game, or petition for, say, a Wrath server that was more of a compromise between vanilla and post-cata design.
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one. I've been able to ignore it since they announced it at Blizzcon and really didn't think about it until this last post. Not sure what brought me here to even see that post in the first place. But now I can't stop refreshing this sub, listening to the soundtrack or listening to ClassiCast. I need this to stop lol.
---
I started playing a warlock the day the game went live and it took until 1.4+ for me to get to level 60 as that quest was waiting for me.
---
And yet, I somehow said I would get to level 60 in two weeks on a survey a month or so ago.
---
Clearly I'm in for a rude awakening 
---
&gt;We don’t know if they are temporarily increasing caps.
---
Then what is going to happen when the tourists leave? Dead servers immediately within weeks?
---
&gt; edit: Shit, this is info for the pally mount, not warlock mount. 
---
Lol I was thinking "it's been a while, but I don't remember any of this shit" 
---
Maybe my perspective here is skewed by having raided as a Rogue spamming Sinister Strike as fast as my finger would move (except when it was advantageous to pool energy).
---
Haha. Back then i played only horde but that screenshot motivated me to try alliance. I did end up with a nightelve warrior :p
---
I ruined two (cheaper) keyboards playing my rogue in firelands/DS.  I know the pain, though its been a while.
---
My 105 warrior has less binds then my old 39 twink warrior. Blizzard has really simplified every class :( 
---
WPvP goes to Warlock easy. Damn near indestructible in gear.
---
Premade goes to Mage, you'll be the guy looking to nuke as hard and as fast as possible. With a good team you can stay alive in your downtime, provide good CC and slows. Warlock might be OK as a flag guard with SL for high survivability, instant pets for CC/Shield, Fear, Coil, etc. Not really a nuke class but can eat some damage and stay alive if played well. Can give healers a headache when you spread DoTs.
---
PUG raid prob the Mage for DPS, CC.
---
More fun for me has always been the Lock. Good toolkit, can burst with the right spec/gear, can live through some tough times with SL.
---
Played both through Naxx.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azrefd/looking_for_group_monday_march_11_2019/
---
That is a lateral translation of what I'm saying. You can continue to Raid Ulduar and try to kill Algalon, what the fuck is stopping you and your guild from just staying in Ulduar until you are satisfied with it? Then move onto the next one. It is the hard core player-base that has caused blizzard to need to vomit content out constantly. It is not their fault you don't keep up with the tiers as they release them. 
---
&gt; Yes, we're called Alliance rogues fighting orcs
---
Your point is taken, but orcs don't have a 100% stun resist.
---
Yeah, sorry to anyone I confused.  I've been deep in pally-mount land lately :P  The concept *should* be roughly the same.  Collect everything you possibly can, and then when it finally drops just burn the quest line down.
---
Grind the Plaguebats is EPL, with skinning as a profession xD. That's what I did for my epic mount.
---
Thank you :)
---
As a warlock, soul stoning myself seemed a great idea to save all that corpse running. Never realised I could soul stone a healer or a tank in a dungeon, was only when I rez'd from a few wipes that I was politely informed where I was going wrong.
---
&gt; Most paladins are going to have and want to use Verigan's Fist at this point. 
---
Paladins use Verigan's Fist from ~20-34 or so and get either this or Bonebiter since both are a 15+ DPS increase with better seal of command proc rate.
---
Bonebiter's the SM reward axe, so no RNG from Herod, more DPS 41.6 (including the STR) vs Ragaver 37.3 ( Though Ravager norms at 43.3 with 1 proc a minute due to 3 extra hits, if the mob's still alive, that is)
---
Just sayin' this is the point where Verigan's gets replaced.
---
Lay a freezing trap and concussive shot kite him in a circle around it, chuckling in dwarvish until he dies or tries to intercept me. And then he dies.
---
Not a snack but I use to chug Arnold Palmer's when playing.
---
This post is 5 months old lol, but it'd be surprising and unlikely I think for a hunter to be able to burst someone that easily. You might be able to get some good crits with aimed and arcane shot but hunters are more of a "I'm going to wear you down til you peel over and die" kind of class. Not necessarily harder, or less rewarding, I'd say just more consistent and slower. 
---
Hunters are very strong in PvP though, and are a real challenge for melee classes, or any class vulnerable to snaring. Elemental shamans are very bursty and strong but don't have quite the sustain that hunters or spriests have. In equal gear settings, with equal skill, on average PvP situations (not just 1v1 or group), I'd say it goes spriest&gt;hunter&gt;shaman, but it's close, and plenty will disagree with me on that. 
---
So far all we know is Blizzard is more or less attempting to offer a  vanilla server option that is reasonably low maintenance and hands-off as they don't want to run a 2nd MMO in addition to the modern game. We have no info on the possibility of TBC, Wrath, or any other expansion servers at this point. I'd imagine expansion servers would retain their respective mechanics and design, though, including any talent changes or revamps to the talent system. In other words, if in the future a Mists server is offered, it will most likely include the talent system revamp for authenticity and minimal rebalancing on Blizz's end.
---
Well shit, this is awkward.  I just realized i went with browns &gt;.&gt;;
---
Its odd that you mention that you didnt like them, from what i remember reading the browns are fairly similar to blues, they just require a bit less force to press.  AFAIK theyre still a lot stiffer than reds.
---
I think this is a Blizzard undercover agent
---
I *just* leveled a paladin to 60 somewhere that can't be named.  I had this and verigan's fist.  The stats from verigan's actually made it better than ravager.  IMO Bonebiter isn't worth passing up thrashblade if you plan on needing a 1h+shield for anything.
---
Why is that? I thought wotf was super good.
---
Not him, but I may be able to answer that. The biggest OCE servers on retail currently are very populated, yes, and I imagine (as long as Blizzard does not add too many OCE classic servers) that they will be roughly as populated as US servers in classic. All of us OCE people had to deal with OCE to US ping before they added proper OCE servers (and still do in pvp/cross-realm pve). I personally got around 220 ping in vanilla and it was still perfectly playable even as melee. Internet infrastructure has improved since then and the latency between OCE and USWest is more like 120-170 these days.
---
I don't think so. When WoW came out, it was incomparable. I never played anything like it and I was sucked into a universe for years. Everyday I experienced something very new and exciting.  My fondest memory was corpse walking from Ironforge to Stormwind because I didn't know the tram existed.
---
Instead of feeling like a new discovery, I think every moment will be nostalgic which, though powerful, isn't the same.
---
I'm still going to play the absolute shit out of the game, but ultimately I don't think it will be as enjoyable.
---
From what I remember reading and hearing the server cap was dynamic, there was never really a hard cap. The most the servers could handle at the time was around 3500. I'm not promoting for a mega server like the private ones, just saying there was never really an official "hard set" number beyond the max capacity of the hardware at the time. 
---
taking druids of any spec is a "bring the player, not the class" type deal
---
i am an absolute advocate for bear druids so im not even going to write about it. cat druids dont suck only if youre a good player who doesnt try to play it like its retail. as much fun as ive had getting to raid as a cat in the past, unless you happen to have more than 4 excellent melee dps (good luck with that because theyre more complicated than warlock/mage literal 1 button rotations) theres not much of a point in taking more than 1
---
resto druids suck in general. lower output on almost all fights by a huge margin, brutal mana costs... innervate and battle res isnt a benefit to a raid since they innervate themselves and battle res is a crutch. dont need it if your guild is doing things correctly
---
I didn't realize how huge at the time, but looking back, it was insane.
---
1) No.
---
2) OK
---
3) Irrelevant
---
4) Fuck no. Go play retail where everyone is the same.
---
5) No.
---
6) Sure.
---
Nice.    
---
I think the composition worked better with the bear, but it's still beautiful.
---
I believe browns are the quietest. That's what I use at work and it's pretty reasonable.
---
Great item, but not a world drop!
---
So you intend to fix the problem by making it worse? Increasing the max pop just increases the potential for even more crowding during launch and then still having dead servers once the hype dies down. Also what if a "streamer" realm never dies down? Do you keep the massive cap that is non-vanilla and have crowding issues permanently? 
---
Either they merge severs or have a couple shards per realm and server mergers are just as bad, if not worse, for the vanilla sense of community. 
---
I hope not. I remember when that became the    norm during WotLK, was not a fan.
---
It is good but Orcs are very strong due their 25% stun resist.
---
One of the greatest threats for WLs are rogues and 25% of stuns will miss you due to being an Orc alone.
---
Wotf is mostly helpful against other WLs against which you are on an even playing field anyways.
---
&gt;The point of this whole project is to recreate the game as it was then, for better and/or for worse.
---
First off this isn't what we're getting *nor is it what the no-changers are asking for*. What they want is a recreation of their private server experience, not a recreation of WoW as it was. 
---
Take for example having frozen 1.12 talents with a progressive content release. As you may know from playing on private servers, this causes Fury warriors to be absolutely crushing it even when the only raid available is MC (and Ony). However, this is a far cry from "recreating the game as it was then." It took until 1.6 for fury warrior to be halfway decent (because that was when their talents were revamped) - which is the release of BWL. And dual-wield was helped against significantly in patch 1.8 (which is after the 1.7 release of ZG). Compare this with say a pre 1.4 enhancement shaman, whose windfury had DOUBLE to base bonus AP, and whose windfury could proc off itself! So when MC was the only raid available, an enhancement shaman would  be dealing comparable (if not better) damage than a fury warrior - but if we go off of what Blizzard is giving us, we're ending up with a very much non-blizzlike situation of warriors dealing at least double that of enhancement.
---
So we're already having pretty substantial rebalancing of the game from how it was back then. Yet it is still "no changes" - because what's relevant is that it is "no changes" from Nostalrius, Not that it's no changes from Vanilla WoW. (As a side note, that's also why you see big support for other Nost changes, such as increased server size). 
---
Further - just the very fact that we're getting a *Frozen State of Balance* with frozen 1.12 should tip you off that we're not getting something that accurately recreates Vanilla WoW. Like it or not (and "no changers" are surely in the not category) Vanilla WoW was an iterative process with constant balance passes. 1.1 existed, as did 1.2, 1.3, and so on. Every class got numerous balance changes, and blizzard even refunded the talents for every class at least once when their talents were reworked. Having a frozen state of balance is antithetical to recreating Vanilla. 
---
But let's forget about all that for a second, and just assume that what the no changers wants actually recreates Vanilla (which again, it clearly does not). Why should a carbon-copy be the goal or the "point of the project." If we slightly buff shitty hybrids through backporting proven talents from TBC, but they're still not strong enough to be "optimal" have we really threatened Vanilla?
---
I always give hunter pets a good /pat, unless they are something terrifying. 
---
&gt; The stats from verigan's actually made it better than ravager.
---
15 DPS lower, 58 lower max damage, for what better stats? The 12 spirit? IMO none of the stats on Verigan's is worth passing up a 60% + DPS increase.
---
Orcs get passive 25% stun resist
---
Except there used to be add-ons in Wrath that did calculate your gear. It was called gearscore and was used quite a lot during Wrath
---
Having a mount at 40 is quite easy with a warrior. Warrior dps is mainly dependant on weapon. Find some people to help you with the ww axe at 30 and only buy essential spells and its easy. 
---
We are all in the same boat
---
Seeing this just makes me realize what little connection I felt to my chars after the graphics 'update'.  Those faces are WoW to me, don't care how cartoony or stiff they may look.  
---
I can agree. Some of our hunters were top 10-15 dps but I minmaxed much and was up to mid Naxx always top 3-5 dps.
---
Hunters dps was much better in vanilla compared to other classes than it is on all the private servers.
---
Give me S4 Shamane with S4-2H and I will One-Shot every S4-Mage with those MASSIVE CRITS!!! Beavis is real !!

---
Herb is a better pick up than enchanting for princess runs, and just in general IMO. You get 1 stack of blind weed per hour. Blindweed should go for like 2-4G a stack. Once you get really fast it’s even possible to take a longer route on one run to grab a few ghost mushrooms, which are like 50s-1G each.  Compare this to DE the black stone ring, gets you a small brilliant shard, which are maybe 1-2G each. So basically you got to get lots of duplicate rings to get close to the herb money. 
---
Then of course herbing is just a better money maker in general. On your travels to dungeons/raids or farm spots picking up herbs is easy money. 
---
Browns imo
---
&gt; What they want is a recreation of their private server experience, not a recreation of WoW as it was.
---
Not me.  I think you're putting words in the mouths of a **huge** category of people.  It would be as bad as me saying *"all the people asking for changes just want LFR and Flying mounts added to Vanilla!"*  There's more nuance to that and you know it.
---
&gt; Why should a carbon-copy be the goal or the "point of the project."
---
Because if it isn't, then people will just keep asking for Vanilla as it was.
---
&gt; If we slightly buff shitty hybrids through backporting proven talents from TBC, but they're still not strong enough to be "optimal" have we really threatened Vanilla?
---
Neither of us are good enough game designers to answer this question truthfully.  There is no telling what kind of butterfly effect buffing something like Balance Druids could have on the game.
---
I have brown with red o-rings. Perfect for typing and feels great in an mmorpg.

People have tried remaking gearscore on vanilla pservers, it doesnt really work.
---
As for retail, blizzard have made gear so attainable that ilvl is no longer a good metric to finding out if a player is shit at the game or not. You can get heroic quality gear without ever stepping into a normal raid.
---
Other then that im not sure what you are getting at...

Matters about as much as how you cut your fingernails.

If you go WF/WF it has a 39% (Mathematicly) to proc. Compared to those 20%. BUT! There was a Bug which made WF R5 / WF R4 not shareing the same GCD. So both could proc WF at the same time. This got fixed later. Which mean that only 1 weapon could have proct WF and shared on a 3sec. CD. BUT! 2H was still available during TBC there was even a BiS for Enhancer at ElitisJerk
---
leveling a warrior is fine if you do these three things:
---
1) never pull more than 1 mob at a time
---
2) get food from mages because there is no way you will afford vendor food while leveling the first time as a warrior
---
3) STAY LIKE 4 MILES AWAY FROM ROGUES, MAGES, AND HUNTERS AFTER YOU LEAVE DUSKWOOD OR THE BARRENS
---
Thanks for the advice!!
---
Although yeah there qill deffinitly be logs for classic, there was for pservers so i dont see why i wouldnt be able to look up the OP on there and findout if hes shit or not
---
Well not to sound harsh or anything but it doesn't matter what you're reading or hearing when the original developers say that it was a design decision.
---
/sit crits for Reckoning worked against abilities (yellow damage), but it didn't work on white damage. Was that the case there?
---
bruh i meant like i would rather put gold towards an upgrade that lasts 40 levels (riding) rather than keep an item i keep for 10 levels when i can just use greens instead because it doesnt matter if i have 4 strength or 8 strength on my chestpiece if im only level 25
---
Sash of Healing, from farming elite bugs in Silithus. Pretty psyched about it since I needed healing gear for MC.
---
What I did back in the day was the following: Get seal of Command in Retribution and level with 2handers, then start putting points into holy and pick up consecration. You're going to have to drink a lot, but you can farm 5 mobs at a time at least, like this.  
---
At level 60, I'd be holy, but with a few points in Retribution, to have some offensive power (there are probably better solutions, like going protection instead of ret, for Blessing of Sanctuary). I would then farm The Unstoppable Force, and use that outside raids. I was able to farm Elemental Earth at a quite reasonable speed, and I had the gear to main heal level capped dungeons (Righteous Orbs, etc.)  
---
But. The more efficient option is probably to go consecration into blessing of sanctuary, while putting enough points into holy to be able to heal raids. That way you can AoE farm with pretty good survivability, but you will have to drink quite a bit.
---
Need 3 for tranq shot rotation 
---
Orc is the best race for pvp. 
---
As a priest you want to level as shadow while putting points into spirit tap and wand spec (in Disc). You do have the option of leveling as Smite spec, so then you pick up Spirit tap and wand spec and then the points that increase Holy dps. (Not as efficient but something different).
---
As a druid you want to level as Feral and you can decide if you want to focus on tanking talents or not depending if you want to tank dungeons. You do have the option of leveling balance for something different but it wont be nearly as efficient and you will miss out on the feral talent that increases your speed in cat form. Also it is nice that feral does not use mana so you have a full mana bar to heal after each mob, making feral leveling super efficient. Leveling as resto sounds terrible.
---
For shaman you want to level as enhancement while picking up the instant ghost wolf for ease of travel. If you are higher level than the dungeon content you can also have fun tanking with a shield and using rockbiter and earthshock for threat. You can level as elemental but you miss out on the instant ghost wolf. I do hear though you can kill things faster as elemental once you hit 40 so it is not a bad option to switch from enhancement to elemental around lvl 40. Leveling as resto sounds meh...
---
For Paladin you want to level as Ret. You get the increased run and mount speed which is nice, plus it is the fastest way to kill enemies. Some people like farming mobs as prot because you kill things with your ret aura, consecrate, and shield spike. But honestly it seems like much more work than just running up and smashing a face. Leveling as Holy sounds horrible. 
---
as much as trying to find sungrass in azshara on sunny day or looking for steelbloom in arathi while its raining makes me want to yeet my computer through the window (i have bad vision), i hope it remains
---
No it's fine, I believe you and I heard that same statement. I was only pointing out the fact that there was never a set hard number.  2500 was the design decision, but the cap was still dynamic allowing for player population to exceed that, but I don't think it ever went beyond 4k. 
---
Titans grip and explosive shot were my favorite talents in bc and wotlk. I can see titans grip making fury warriors even more over the top in classic 
---
It’s not wed but this is still up so I’ll throw it out there.
---
Buddy I’m going to play with the most is 100% rolling priest, so I’ve been exploring other classes because seems like it’s be more fun to play diff classes and not compete on gear. But my best memories of wow are also as priest, I have recently tried leveling both a Shaman and Druid and healing RFC + WC as them and it’s just not nearly as fun, at that level.
---
But the more I look at other classes, priest is the only one that really feels right because I’ll ultimately be spending most of my time doing PvE stuff and I find them by far the most fun class in group play.
---
So can someone make me feel better about rolling the same class as my friend? Or convince me that shaman healing is just as fun?
---
I used blues and even greens for awhile and thought the brown / reds were pointless but eventually I realized that I was having trouble double tapping / spamming keys due to the second clack (when blues actuate) and would sometimes not let the switch fully release. It would cause me to miss abilities or use them a moment too late.
---
Switched to browns a few years ago and they're a lot more consistent and precise, at least for me.
---
Blues are super nice for typing and browsing but for gaming they just caused trouble. Sometimes I'll swap out to my blues for a few days but I always go back to browns if I know I'll be gaming a lot.
---
Please note my two caveats that changed the equation for me:   1) I always duo with my wife.  It would probably have helped make more sense if I mentioned she was a warrior.  That means I was healing a lot more than the average leveling pally and dpsing a lot less.   We pulled as few single mobs as we can.  I even rushed consecrate early vs soc b/c I wanted the intellect and cleave.   I also always farm SM until I have everything I want out of it (i.e. mograine's might).
---
Thats not a bad thing though, perhaps for leveling you should only focus on offensive stats but maxing all your stats is a thing people do at 60 for pvp as a druid. If you look at the pvp set for example, it has all the stats + abit of spellpower. You sir were ahead of your time
---
Based
---
why would you sell an account with what I assume at max a lvl 20ish character?  who would ever buy it?  Most (young) people back then played with prepaid cards, you could just stop buying those ...  
---
You want to focus on questing and using grinding if say there is a gap in levels between your current level and the next zones level. There are leveling guides online that will tell you exactly the route you should take for your leveling experience.

---
We'll be much less hardcore than what you sound like but we'll take progression seriously (even if not rushing through it). :) (Raid times are not fixed yet. Seems like your times should be fine, though.) Just an idea, I hope I wasn't a bother. If you have questions, just ask.
---
that disadvantage is only for world pvp. In battlegrounds it doesn't matter, if anything you have an advantage as an alliance because there is no paladin to instantly remove all your dots and fears.
---
I can't tell you how many rogues I had to teach how to play properly with combat swords and SnD in my guild (got to 60 quite early and was a theory crafter). Literally everyone wanted to play daggers because "why would rogues have backstab if you didn't use it" and also used eviscerate over SnD.
---
You'll be fine.  Run extra dungeons if you don't get weapon drops but warrior leveling is less about specific levels and more about weapons
---
Until level 20 it doesn't matter much but do the best you can with quest rewards.  Don't buy anything from AH!
---
Horde side- get Crescent staff from WC
---
Alliance- run deadmines to get either Smite's hammer or cruel barb (either will be acceptable for solo play, but smite's hammer is best)
---
Also alliance- get Orc Crusher (Redridge quest) if you don't have good luck with Smite's hammer- level 22-24 elites in Redridge but you can easily find groups for it and orc crusher is basically as good as Smite's hammer
---
RFK for Corpsemaker once you get to high 20s (crescent staff/smite's hammer is fine til then but gets progressively less useful of course =P)
---
WW Axe as time allows, you have to spend gold to get the charms or somehow farm red mobs (good luck with that.. not really worth it IMO!)  So if you spend 3-5g on the charms, then you can get someone to help with Cyclonian.  Cyc can be kited, I got him at level 31 with corpsemaker and a mage friend spamming frostbolts.  We ping-ponged aggro back and forth and would bandage when we dropped aggro.  He died at one point, but I just kept hamstring kiting and used a pot and he made it back, evoc'd, and had plenty of mana left to finish it off.  But of course, get a level 40 friend or something and it's trivial. 
---
At level 40 you can do the SM quest for the 1h sword.  might of Mograine is basically a wash compared to WW axe, and if you went Arms it's not as good because you'll have +5% crit with WW axe!
---
Uldaman has a 2h weap if I believe, good upgrade.  Otherwise WW axe can still carry you fine into mid 40s.  Mara has the Princess scepter, and there's weapons in ZF as well to help keep you current.  Once you get the princess scepter (or a high 40s 1h) you are fine for questing into your 50s and can start running instances that will get you acceptable weapon options to get you into end-game (BRD, ST).  
---
Your big challenge is just getting the mount.  Herb/alch is your best bet.  Potions sell easily for extra gold, and health pots are a big time saver to keep you alive!  The hour-long pots are best used in instances or when you're VERY sure you won't get ganked.  Don't use them in STV.. please.. 
---
Alternatively you could just go herb/skinning if you have an Alch friend to make some pots from your mats.  Heavy and Thicc leather are great money making tools and are accessible during your mount grinding phase in the mid/high 30s. 
---
There are plenty of good spots for grinding, but crocs are a GREAT money maker for people who skin.  Heavy leather is reliably perhaps 2s-3s per piece, thick leather is 3-5s per, and their grey drops are usually around 3-5s per mob as well so you're easily clearing 1g every 10-20 mobs depending on luck.  Throw in a boe green or two or the white items that sell (wicked claw, large fang are best) and you can easily get to 40 with 90g. 
---
Don't train higher ranks of many skills like overpower, cleave, heroic strike that only add a small amount of damage per rank.  You only need a few abilities to perform basic tank / DPS functions: 
---
Sunder max rank
---
battle shout max rank
---
revenge max rank (unless threat doesn't increase with it, otherwise meh!)
---
execute max rank (base damage increases a lot)
---
Charge max rank (amount of rage generated increases iirc)
---
Other than those I think rank 1 is fine for most other abilities and you will save heaps of gold by holding off on them to help make sure you have 90g at level 40.  That's what it's all about!
---
They said get ready for a classic summer, also in the blizzcon vids there’s some things pointing to a July 16th release, but all we really know is it’s coming out this summer

It’s the experience; it made even the basic dungeons more epic experiences that often included one of each class.

Install a swing timer and learn how to hamstring kite and leveling warrior is easy. If you stand still like a rabbit in headlights and take a beating then yeah it’s gonna suck. 
---
Browns are indeed similar to blues, just less actuation force and less clickyness. Reds are "gamer" switched in a sense, people doing high APM stuff tend to prefer them, but I've been playing fps games with blues for years without issue.
---
not a counterspelled holy tree
---
/lick that Ashkandi.
---
Level the warrior first if it's what you enjoy.
---
First things first I don't think its too much slower / harder than most classes - the warrior I'm currently leveling is at 32 and it's a breeze - even without access to plate, an alt feeding me gear, or most importantly MS / BT, once you hit 40 having a button to actually press (and a strong one at that) makes the rest a cake walk.
---
Beyond that what you lack in grinding speed you make up for with desirability in a group, and will get virtually instant invites to dungeons, group quests or farming groups.
---
Lastly - unless you plan on being a 24/7 no lifer I just don't see leveling an alt first to be reasonable. I'm expecting it to take 2-3 months for me to hit 60, regardless of what I play. Let's say its Mage for supreme farming potential, so first I have to hit 60, then I have to farm dungeons / rep / whatever to get good enough gear to efficiently farm, then I have to level my "main" - taking another 2-3 months, while at the same time taking time to actually do the farming I leveled the mage for in the first place - which could well double the time it takes to level the "main" if you are splitting time 50/50 between leveling the main, and grinding to feed him.
---
While it is true that having a farm class to feed you alt gear and gold will make the leveling process much more fun and smooth - it's not worth dinging 60 on your "main" 6+ months after release, at which point you still are just an undergeared 60 who needs to grind all his pre-bis, rep and attunments anyway.
---
warlock
---
More niche, more fun abilities, hard counter the endless number of mages and are a huge bane to paladins (if going horde side).
---
Hunters are fun, but to really excel you have a much higher skill ceiling.  And honestly, warlocks when geared at 60 have far more potential to kill Xv1's better than hunters, due to higher durability, spell stones, health stones, sacrifice, high dot damage, etc...
---
...being able to also throw dots on everything in giant wpvp fights means you will be doing immense damage and always near the top of the kill charts in AV.
---
The 40 mount doesn't come from dm
---
There's one other solution: charge up front for the game. Now instead of BfA tourists you get people who are at least somewhat invested in the game.
---
However Blizz won't do this since providing extra value for your BfA subscription is likely one of the ways they internally justify the project.
---
I still Main Hunter now in BfA and it’s the character I started in Vanilla.
---
I’m very torn on what to do for Classic. The thought of getting Rhok and Lok (again) fills me with excitement, as does the thought of finishing my favourite tier set (T2) for real this time around. 
---
However, I also want to play a class that will be very very good in both PvP (BGs and WPvP) as well as Raiding. I have read Mage is better (which is also always the class I wanted to try back in my Vanilla days).
---
Plus feeding pets and restocking on arrows will feel very annoying compared to the current retail experience I’m now used to.
---
Decisions. 
---
Meta has changed as knowledge has grown. Feral tanks are viable if played correctly due to the insanely high TPS. They are absolutely bis for speedrunning. 
---
It is hard to fight undead as a warlock, but not impossible. WotF only lasts 5 sec and WotF doesn't make you immune to Death Coil sense coil is a horrify not a fear effect.
---
I knew it would be the ardent custodian, that was my only epic world drop as well :(
---
I was a warrior so it was ok, swapped it for a blood razor and rin ji axe soon enough tho 
---
I actually was planning to level as herb/alch so that's good! I was worried about that choice as everyone says to tank you need engineering.  Lots of awesome info, thank you so much!
---
Brah, what happened to your ranged slot?
---
&gt; When the next map is ready this thread will be deleted.
---
What is the point of posting it and then deleting it?
---
Those empty trinket slots used to bother me the whole time leveling up. I wanted to have something and every slot and it drove me insane!
---
Staff of Jordan in Scarlet Monastery. 
---
Was level 34 on my Undead Priest and grouped with 4 randoms, everyone needed of course and I ended up being the lucky winner. I really debated on using it for myself, but ultimately decided that selling it was the better option.
---
Had no trouble buying my level 40 mount and I used the rest to finish up my level 19 Hunter twink.
---
Anen. Those should be saved for announcing a new raid and the last boss of an expansion. 
---
I'm hoping Sekiro will keep my brain busy for a month, that's out next Friday. Game of Thrones soon too, something to look forward to each week! 
---
I was going to level cooking while leveling as much as I could but great advice about Desolace! I did the same thing with my rogue in vanilla with the fortress as I could also pickpocket :)
---
&gt;Not me. I think you're putting words in the mouths of a huge category of people. It would be as bad as me saying "all the people asking for changes just want LFR and Flying mounts added to Vanilla!" There's more nuance to that and you know it.
---
No actually, I really don't. Most people were up and arms and pushing for a progressive content release. When it happened, people were happy, but it wasn't enough, and there was a popular sentiment here that there should be progressive itemization, as well as a more split progressive content release, which would more closely match the private server experience. This sentiment was so large in the community that Blizzard picked up on it and just a few days ago announced such changes. There's also a lot of talk about raising the server caps, and Blizzard AT BLIZZCON hinted they were thinking about doing that. The actual blizzlike cap is 2k or 2.5k (with conflicting numbes for Staats and Kern). The debate in this sub is usually between a smaller 4-5k size, or the bigger 10k size of late Nost. People are not pulling for a 2k. You're accusing me of saying there's no nuance, *and I know it.* But what I'm describing is the No-Changes orthodoxy *and you know it.* Yes, there might be some differing views, but they are the exception, not the rule.
---
In any event, the larger point is that what we're getting is not a recreation of WoW as it was, because frozen 1.12 balance makes major balance changes. You probably should rebut this - otherwise you can't really say "I don't want some balance changes, because that will make WoW less similar to how it actually was." The truth is balance changes would actually make it more similar. 
---
&gt;Because if it isn't, then people will just keep asking for Vanilla as it was.
---
?? And if WoW is how it was, then people will keeping asking for balance changes. I'm not sure what's so awful about either outcome. 
---
&gt;Neither of us are good enough game designers to answer this question truthfully. There is no telling what kind of butterfly effect buffing something like Balance Druids could have on the game.
---
There's certainly edge cases. I'm not sure balance druids are, but lets be more charitable and assume you used the example of elemental shaman, which is optimal in horde premades, but bad in PvE. 
---
We know from looking at Naxx numbers that hunters are dealing less than half the DPS on average as Warriors/Mages. We can say with a high degree of certainty that ret paladins and enhancement shamans are doing worse damage than hunters. (Though truth be told, in the 40+ Naxx raid stats I looked at, I didn't see any dps paladins or shamans).
---
We also know that enhancement shaman is so bad that it's not even considered for one of the two open flex spots in a pushing R14 premade PvP group. 
---
I can answer this question truthfully: giving even somewhat substantial buffs to an enhancement shaman (like say reverting to pre 1.4 windfury), will not have a butterfly effect on what's optimal for raids or premades. 
---
But perhaps you disagree with my premises, and it does end up having a butterfly effect. Guess what! THAT'S VANILLA WOW - I'm repeating myself here, but WoW was an iterative process with major balance changes every patch. I thought you were trying to argue for getting something that is like Vanilla - but the worst case scenario is we get iterative balance patches, which actually recreates vanilla, unlike a frozen state of balance.
---
I don't want to oversell us, so I'd say our expressed focus is raiding. However, with 40+ people in the guild, I'm sure you'd find quite a few friendly faces. :) (We are also rolling on a PVE server, PVP is up to individual members.) If you *are* interested, just ask!
---
Ignore virtually everything this guy says.
---
Probably just the same.
---
While its no longer new and the sense of discovery is gone, that feeling has been replaced by a sense of mastery and gameplay goals that I want to push myself to rather than just exploring and seeing what happens.
---
New experience from a new veteran perspective, but enjoyable all the same.
---
It's worth it man. Just play the opposite faction than what you plan to play in classic. That's what I'm doing. That way you can scratch that itch without spoiling the feeling of exploring those zones again.
---
That is an actual model you can wield in game iirc. Or something very similar to it.
---
We want the game, not the jank. 
---
\#NoChanges can fuck off.  I want a nice 2019 experience with my 2006 game please.
---
I actively play on pservers and play the game because I love it. I don't like the jank that i get.
---
Who cares about sharding in the first zone or two, that's the shortest part of the game. 
---
Me too? I've been thinking about doing something like that for days now. Would love to see what others have made. 
---
Nothing wrong with having fun and getting excited
---
bro it peaked with your original post
---
Fair point, I guess my main concern with a gathering Prof (herb/mining) at the start is competing with the Zerg come launch. I'm sure it'll be fine with the initial sharding but beyond that I think keeping up with the level in each zone is going to be tough. For leveling, skinning to the vendors seems like the most time efficient source of extra gold. 
---
Could also be overthinking it, but I guess it'll be a gut decision whenever I get the feel of the competition. 
---
Any good recommendation on swing timer? Thanks!!!
---
on what basis?
---
&gt; People are already calling for the 2 expansions to be released with changes. Things like:
---
It's a list of things that people have or may want changed to bring TBC and Wrath up to Vanilla level.
---
Eh. I think wow started taking a nose dive mid wotlk. Making raids easier with buffs so everyone regardless of skill was the nail in the coffin for me. 
---
Feral is fine for solo play and pvp, but for group content you'll be stuck healing.  Warriors make better tanks and rogues make better dps by margins that make it not even worth taking feral for those roles.
---
I guess I'll die then.

Great great great point.  I plan to level fairly quickly, but I forgot about also having to gear up the farming character too.
---
Next time you want to share your thoughts, kill yourself instead. Everything about this is retarded
---
&gt; having constantly bought new white weapons from the vendors whenever available because they were better than the ones I had...
---
bless you.  Those vendors still talk about you... 'remember the good old days, when people would actually BUY our goods, instead of just using us to dump endless piles of bat ears, gnoll spittle and Partially Digested Meat
---
This is amazing
---
Well if he isn’t flexible either then one can go SP and the other holy, have fun 
---
More for sure. I was too young when it first came out to really understand why warriors don't wear cloth. I can actually be good at it as an adult now. 
---
From what I understand there was a technical limitation too yes. Obviously since unlimited isn't reasonable. However the technical limitation was higher than the cap the game was designed around.
---
Oh my
---
Because merging sucks. It destroys organically grown server community structures and forces people to change their characters' names. 
---
Are you on Alliance and concerned enough with threat that you're considering having a fury/prot warrior dual wield tank? If yes then a hardcore minmaxing feral druid tank player. one that is willing to spend countless hours in gnomer farming manual crowd pummelers, might be a good alternative.
---
Otherwise a standard fury/prot 1h+shield tank that can do solid DPS when not required to tank is a better choice.
---
I’m having the same dilemma. The exact same. 
---
No. A warrior will do just fine as a solo character.
---
I use SP swing timer but no idea if it will be updated for 1.13 :) 
---
I think the more of us who play druids, the more they will be accepted.  The WoW community has always needed an attitude adjustment when it comes to someone playing a certain class or spec other than meta.  If you want to play it, play it and get damn good at it.  This is what I am looking forward to with classic.  You really have to focus on a character, not just zoom to max level and handed everything, you have to put in real work, and the feeling of satisfaction for it is astounding.
---
I second this. Herbalism and Mining is the best form of cash as a priest. If you don't want to alternate between Find Herbs and Find Mines (since you can't find both at the same time) you can substitute 1 for skinning, which comes in handy in STV and in various yeti quests.
---
I made the mistake of leveling as Herbalism and Alchemy on my priest and I had no money...switched to Herb/Mining and was able to finally buy my fast mount.

---
Do I play hunter...warlock...warrior like old times... THE ANTICIPATION IS KILLING ME I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO
---
I've been playing in (other places) and the ammo/feeding bit is really not a big deal IMO. Once your pet "likes you" more, it becomes pretty infrequent that you need to feed it. 
---
For the ammo, it's just one extra step when you turn in each round of quests. The only time I've had an issue with it is when I first ran WC, and that's just because I forgot how friggen long the dungeon is in vanilla. 
---
From what I've read, the only real difference in capabilities is DPS meters in raids. All else, they're both strong. Decisions indeed. 
---
&gt; but druids have lower output on almost all fights by a huge margin,
---
Not true.
---
&gt; brutal mana costs..........innervate and battle res from a resto isnt a benefit to a raid since they innervate themselves 
---
You point out high mana costs but then complain they innervate themselves - which deals with the high mana costs.  LOL
---
&gt; battle res is a crutch
---
lolk
---
It's widely accepted on the private server scene, with the evidence on legacyplayers, that Druids can top/compete on healing meters/output e.g
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=29013&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=45379
---
&gt;You will not DPS **you will not tank**
---
What did you smoke? Druids have the highest threat output in the game with Pummelers. You absolutely will be able to tank if thats your goal. I'm currently tanking BWL and AQ40 on my own Druid just fine.
---
I used that axe as a hunter in AQ40 during the gauntlet after battleguard Sartura to AOE for shits and giggles. It was better than volley since the proc can crit  =p
---
The first 31 points stayed pretty similar from class revamp in vanilla through wrath so there's not really much to say.  Now when 2.0 came out and the 41 point talents popped up that you could get at 60, that was interesting.
---
not bad, that was the most rare boe epic in the entire game
---
Nothing will beat that first time you come down the elevator into Undercity or the first time you downed a hard boss. However, this will be a new experience of re-discovery. I’m looking forward to the “oh yeah! I totally forgot about that!” moments. I started playing wow too late to experience the end game during vanilla so all those old raids everyone loves will be an absolutely new experience for me also. 
---
It does not matter what people would tell you now, because you will change your opinion during the time until release (a few months) many times anyways. 
---
The real decision will be made the moment character creation screen will pop up, so don't overthink it.
---
Nah get that arena business out of here.
---
So what about dead servers? 
---
Reduce the number of servers? Bullshit, you'll have queues of multiple hours... 
---
Server merging? Also bullshit, server merging sucks big time. Destroys communities, names etc
---
Blue feels very nice, but they're VERY noisy and if you ever use Discord without push-to-talk, people will tell you to use push-to-talk. If you play in your bedroom and your girlfriend sleeps there, she will complain about it. Due to the loudness of blue switches, I cannot recommend it for any situation. The satisfying clicky feel is just not worth it.
---
I had red switches for a couple of years and they were good, but eventually switched to browns (browns are basically reds but with feedback) and I'm never looking back. The very subtle tactile feedback from the browns is satisfying enough while not deafeningly loud.

Nice :) thanks!!!

&gt;  If you don't want to alternate between Find Herbs and Find Mines (since you can't find both at the same time) 
---
theres a macro that rotates them automatically
---
not sure if it will work on new classic but it did on pservers for sure
---
&gt; I've mentioned the Bloodvine set bonus, arguably the only legitimate reason to take tailoring since even the BoP recipes can be replaced when tier 2 raid content is released.
---
Bloodvine comes out after T2 and is better than T2
---
Ah yeah, true. Thought it was since I got it in UBRS. But seems like it's actually just a rare boss drop =) 
---
You still have to press the macro, no?
---
60-80 per flask. Source: I sold hundrets of flasks in retail vanilla. 500g for black lotus is a joke.
---
100% true.
---
\&gt; I have a feeling the applicants might be more from retail where those  specs were possible, not vanilla were frequently you had to "bring the  class, not the player".
---
The issue is that for the majority of vanilla feral off-tank(/dps flex) simply wasn't viable. But we will be playing on patches where bear got its huge armor buff already and most pservers do as well. Feral druid on that patch and onwards is not only viable but brings great flexibility and a dps/cleartime increase overall.
---
Things to note: Don't bring a Feral instead of a Rogue/Fury, bring them instead of a off-tank Prot. Your feral druid will do the off-tanking job better and will be more useful when dealing damage and you can even use it to decurse/heal. This way you can cut your overall Warrior count by 1-2, having only 2 prot warriors 1-2 ferals in the tank department. This will also speed up your gearing process.
---
Having just level 1-60 on a private server last year it took me about 25 days of “at least a level a day of playing” to hit 60. The first 35ish were one weekend and the rest took me the last 22 days lol. 
---
Also I was Paladin which was relatively easy. 
---
I have no idea how long it took me back in the day on my hunter, but it felt like forever.

Getting that is more rewarding than ANY epic in retail

Not knowing I could blink out of stuns until level 60...
---
TBC had the better spec design by far. 
---
IIRC everything was viable to be taken along to a raid not only as a favor toward the guy playing it. Yet there was still no homogenization of specs, they still were unique. Aka the sweet spot of class design. 
---
BUT balancing changes are the only case where the slippery slope argument is not total BS. If you add balancing changes, the entire meta shifts. And that goes too far. You see it in all kinds of games where balancing changes are a thing.

a junior engineer has 80k salary in hand, the company probably pays 120k+ for them. seniors can go up to 150k in hand. 540k per year wont pay for a department of 4 people and the space they work in mate.

Porque non los… tres? :)
---
Sure. Got any backup in this 4v1, or is the fact that even r/classic downvoted you going to sway your opinion, or do you just want to bury your head in the sand?
---
I agree, 40 man raiders will need Bijous from ZG for Zanza pots, and Idols/rare enchants/ and new rank spell books from AQ20. 
---
Also the "too good to run ZG" guilds will have to buy the ZG heart buffs from the peon guilds or try to leech ( unless they're too good for world buffs that is)
---
i just wanted to point out that there is a reason to pvp apart from "just for fun", even if you wouldn't want to pvp. that doesn't exclude that ppl pvp just for fun aswell. thats not one or another situation. its both. 
---
and nano said that somehow if we won't have a honor system only reason to pvp would be "just for fun". which is dead wrong.
---
thats not a black or white situation.
---
Im not a "pvp hero" at all lol, thanks for labeling. it just the reality of vanilla that resources are scattered and limited and you will pvp for them. even if you don't want to pvp. cos vanilla designed like that.
---
I have no problems with theorycrafting hybrid specs. The problem is when you get butthurt that the standard specs still work better and you need to go back to the drawing board. Where I have a huge problem is when you use abilities on yourself (eg. innervate) that should go to someone else (eg. mage/holy priest).  Some of the theorycrafting discords go too far in minmax the class rather than the raid. I'd love to join a raid minmax discord and theorycraft on that basis all day.

I dont mind arenas as a fun thing but no rewards. MMORPG is about time investment not about pure skill. Different game.

That’s assuming 3k subs. They’d probably have 30k minimum which is 5.4 mil. 
---
With 3k subs it’d be a owner run business with maybe two employees. 
---
I miss having attractive, believable gear. I know it was always somewhat rare, but last I played (MoP) it just seemed like all of the weapons and a lot of armor looked like they were designed by middle schoolers. I always tried to transmog to the least "epic"-looking gear I could find for my class.
---
People who want to level an alt first to supply mats or whatever are delusional the only time it's actually worth doing is if you dont intend on raiding or somehow think you are gonna level 2 characters to max by the time people level one.
---
That is not even remotely what he's arguing about.   
---
Firstly - dont discount what they will do or do not do. If they decide to add toggle-able modern graphics, that doesn't affect you in the slightest. If they don't, that doesn't affect you in the slightest. Why argue about that?
---
Secondly - Stop comparing Nostalrius to Vanilla. They are not the same. Nostalrius \_emulates\_ vanilla with updated capabilities and data. 
---
Thirdly - what he's saying is that if we were to deny toggle-able modern graphics, then by the same vein, denying widescreen, high resolution support would be the correct path to follow. Because, guess what, widescreen 4k support didn't exist in 2004... only in nostalrius, which isn't retail vanilla WoW.
---
Fourth - Patch 1.12.1, as it was at the time, didn't support widescreen. 
---
I'm 25 and it still feels epic
---
I did it to decide what class I want to play in real classic. It turns out that paladin and warrior were both VERY different than what I was used to by wrath and I ended up hating them and reeling three times at 30 . I would’ve “wasted” 2-3 weeks when classic launched and probably confused a lot of friends.
---
Now I have my race and class set and I’m excited to play the real deal. 
---
Shaman gets more fun later on as your totem collection broadens, but its still very different than priest. Where priest has more healing options than shaman, shaman have a far more customizable support toolkit in their totems, as well as the ability to help with combat with earth shock, frost shock, and purge. And chain heal is tons of fun.
---
In this instance, definitely means Maybe 
---
You actually made it through?
---
Hammer of the Northern Wind in Winterspring. 
---
Trying new stuff is always a fun experiance, in my opinion id rather try something new and not like it. Than do something again and not have as fun as i thought i would have. But you always have the option do try both, vanilla is long. 
---
just to start it
---
google herb mining vanilla macro
---
The client is the client and is unchanged by the server. 
---
The client supports it. It supported it in 2006, which is what the 1.12.1 client is. 
---
Different graphics affects the experience for everyone. 
---
You don’t know anything about what you’re talking about. 
---
I am a server administrator with over 8 certifications and degrees and work on systems like these every day. You are just an armchair fan spouting bullshit about shit you don’t know. 
---
Everyone says you need engi to tank?  No way bud.  
---
To tank you need a decent 1h weap (and at least close to max weap skill), not awful shield, and gear that at least has a healthy amount of stam.  
---
After that, you just need to be aware of how to pull effectively using LOS, how to exert leadership such as marking pulls or telling people to not barge in with aggro stuff immediately, and how to effectively use taunt / when to taunt and how it's aggro works.  Other than that, sunder whenever you can (best use of rage to generate threat) and revenge whenever it procs on the most important target. 
---
Single target (boss) tanking should be easy to keep the boss focused on you, and you'll have to use a bit more of the abilities to mitigate damage such as demo shout, shield block or disarm especially. 
---
Multi-target tanking is hard, but doable.  demo and battle shout both cause some AOE threat, but your best course of action is tab/sunder and marking the focus target.  If DPS are properly ignoring the secondary targets, 1 sunder should be enough to keep mobs off the healer.  
---
Another good option is if you have things 'in hand' and the focus target is about to die, don't bother sundering it again.  Use sunder on the next target (s) and let the focus die. 
---
Finally, consider how taunt works.  It bumps you to the top of the threat list for the mob plus a small% (like what.. 5% higher than the current top of threat?) and makes sure the mob focuses you.  If you taunt and do nothing else, you will likely lose threat after the taunt effect wears off.  Furthermore, don't use an aggro ability on a mob right BEFORE you taunt.  This will waste the aggro you just generated!
---
Use taunt first, THEN sunder.  This should first bump you to the top of the threat list, THEN sunder adds you a nice chunk on top.  
---
This is more info than you need, but tanking really isn't hard.  What is hard is managing group members that don't follow basic rules like focusing targets or body pulling more groups.  If you pull groups far enough back and arrange them properly you should never have a runner pulling more.  DPS should know as well that if there is a runner they should CC it or try to focus it down asap, rather than mindlessly moving on to the next mob. 
---
Tanking is by far the toughest job in an instance but definitely can be very fun as well.  You're in control of the fight and your group, and there's tons of ways you can make sure it goes well. 
---
If you're going to play a healer anyways then playing one that isn't priest isn't going to make much difference when it comes to loot distribution and how good grouping together will be. Go priest and have fun :)
---
Class balance in wotl/bc was much better

---
It's really not such a bad grind for MCPs.  I used to think so until someone explained that it only takes about 5 minutes per run.  If you're only using charges on bosses, you only need about 10 to run MC or BWL, so accounting for drop rates you spend less than 2 hours per raid farming, which isn't terrible as far as vanilla farming for consumables goes.
---
Butchers slicer, I believe.
---
Doing a ST run back in the day and we had TWO BoE epics drop. Hurricane and Axe of the Deep Woods. I wish I bought a lottery ticket that day. I think there was another blue BoE as well. I won the Axe which was not exactly easy to sell.
---
I was leveling a mage during the TBC pre-patch. Killing birds in Badlands. \[Staff of Jordan\] drops for me when I am level 34, just few bars left to level 35; the staff required 35. It was one of the most fulfilling drops I've had in the game. Also my first and last world epic drop to date. It made me feel like playing mage was my 'calling', and so I did. 
---
Maybe I should roll mage for classic, after all (but I love shamans and totems, still conflicted here).
---
A great feral druid is pretty damn good and honestly finding 40 great players is hard even for the most tryhard guilds.
---
But you only really want 1 feral, and there's really only 2 kinds of people who play feral, those that have no idea what they are doing, and the master players. If you can somehow find a really good feral(there's like less than 5?) then sure, if you don't, then well idk how tryhard your guild is. You can test them out iguess. Honestly the whole recruiting players now thing is kinda stupid because anyone can write up about how awesome they are, you dont people before you play with them.
---
What profs usually taken with alliance gnome mage? Planning on doing all content but focusing bgs.
---
Obviously "everyone" is a bit of an exaggeration, but even a search on this subreddit has lots of people advocating for it for the sapper charges for aoe threat and the force reactive disc.  It's definitely something I've seen posted online a lot as well but since I had never played a warrior I couldn't really comment.
---
Thank you for the tanking advice! I've had much more success when I mark things and have people focus targets
---
If you want to still play a good race, start with Tauren. 
---
If you want to dabble with full evil, play Forsaken.
---
Aww dude, 4 strength 4 stam; leather belt!
---
99.999999% of this subreddit never went past Ragnaros in retail vanilla and most of them only played broken pirate servers. 
---
That’s why I don’t get mad at their ignorance about hunters, although it makes me feel bad for players wanting to main hunter in classic but put off by all the negativity.
---
Druid gets to be a bit more fun in my experience, plus you can tank for him in bear form which is great times while levelling.
---
For some classes you really don't need to worry about rolling the same class. Like, if you were both druids it'd be no problem whatsover. A buddy of mine and I did that and we had a blast. Might be a similar situation as shaman, (definitely would be as paladin). I haven't played much priest, but I think you might be able to make the same argument if one of you goes shadow and the other holy, giving the shadow priest more of the DPS stuff and the holy priest more of the heal stuff. 
---
There is an automatic macro script posted online but the poster says that it may be bannable to use.
---
Don't remember but both shadowfang **and pod** dropped when I was leveling an alt and I didn't win either.  Later I tried 'farming' shadowfang on a 60 and it actually dropped again lol. Couldn't believe that one.  I think it was around 500 at the time but I held it for a month and there was a shadowfang dearth so I sold it for 600. Neither is an epic but honestly pod is rarer and way more valuable than most epics.   Also there was some weird guy who was someone's friend and he had a twink that was almost finished and heard I was farming so asked if he could come along. I said "sure. but what exactly is it you need?" (because seriously, what do you need from sfk?)  "assassin's blade"  Then I tried to explain it to him and he got mad at me and told me to fuck off.
---
Oh, I'm not part of either camp here. I'm just a bystander explaining their logic.
---
I thnk your response echos the same themes as many on healing. I'm still leaning toward doing it. I think a big contributing factor is no DPS jumps out at me as very exciting. With the lack of rotations in Vanilla, I know I'll still be the best DPs in my guild, but I also know it'll largely be because I'm going to grind gear and maxamize pots and engineering. I feel like that will get hollow pretty fast -- and I'll just be resentful of people doing less because they care so much less.
---
The classic offtank spec is 31/20 fury/prot. Arms isn't a good off tank spec because mortal strike takes up a debuff slot and isn't nearly as good when using a 1h weapon. Also arms warriors do much less DPS than fury warriors when not tanking.
---
Speaking as a TBC druid, hybrids were already getting OP in TBC. 
---
They're included, this is the amount of dedicated tanks required, like I mention at the bottom fury warriors/druids eat the ot role up to twins 
---
Healed every dungeon up till BRD as a full shadow spec priest. Extremely doable. 
---
If youre a warrior leveling in prot or healer leving holy etc, youre 100% wasting your time.
---
Same! Fresh out of high school. Working full time. I realized I was an adult and no one could stop me from eating at Taco Bell EVERYDAY.
---
It was amazing times. Despite getting chubby :D
---
I would say do what you know and enjoy. Yes new experiences are great but at the same time what your missing out on is more so the quests in certain zones. Pretty much the same quests just different enivornments. Would suck to level horde and then get the urge to go back to your roots. Both are great in their own ways but I think if you truly enjoy human warlock and rogue then just go with it.
---
You can do both. Just play at night mostly
---
Its really just your retail brain asking "uhhh why is not every spec viable for raid and pvp and world and xxx". There's a cost of being hybrid. That's vanilla.
---
Nothing wrong with a little RP.
---
The difficulty is overblown. Just keep your first aid maxed, 2 stacks of food in your bag, and target mobs 1-2 levels below you and you'll have an easy time to 60.
---
What does "got any backup in this 4v1" mean?
---
Fredmonroe: Why should a carbon-copy be the goal or the "point of the project."
---
Valtieri: Because if it isn't, then people will just keep asking for Vanilla as it was
---
 I think the point being made is that Classic appears to be becoming a copy of what Private servers ARE. 
---
I think people who did play in Vanilla and comeback will be confused by the changes that exist in 1.12 that weren't around for the majority of their original experience. Things like weapon speed not mattering anymore and the effectiveness of Dual-wielding. 
---
Meanwhile the private server crowd will immediately know every in and out to these mechanics that they have played with for years. Devilsaur mafias and leather being THE armor for warriors wasnt part of the original experience for most people who originally played. Playing World of Rogues and Warriors or gtfo certainly wasnt my experience but on private servers in raidng it is (yes mages and one hunter but lets be honest mostly fury/combat). 
---
Also part of playing WoW was not knowing what was coming and being aware that the future may change patch to patch, what could be more true to the original experience than changing shit?
---
I sincerely hope they make changes, and make the game harder and less private-server like. They should randomize herb and mining nodes with more locations, especially black lotus. They should add debuff slots on bosses. They should also remove world buffs on entrance to a raid instance. They should also cautiously consider changes to wildly underperforming raid roles. 
---
People tend to hate twinking and twinks b/c of the powerless feeling that being curb-stomped with no way to compete. The options are to get twinked yourself or avoid the twinks (not-playing/pvping etc.). People who like the game but aren't competing due to wild class imbalance, will not want to play. Getting to 60 and realizing you will never get to play a class that can heal as a non-healer sucks. Trying to and knowing you are holding your team back sucks.
---
Why not iterate close to the source? not flying or lfr or arena just make the class passes that would have occured had TBC not come out. Im sure rogues and warriors are happy the patch chosen wasnt pre-1.8. But maybe the game as a whole would be better either w/o it or with some equalization to lift the other classes.

We also have pictures of guides from junk sales, and old CD's

Warlocks can't trinket out of stun, but they can trinket out of fear. That's why stun resist is OP.
---
"new" male tauren running animation is an abomination
---
I agree with this, but would add that PUGs are highly variable and the benefits of summoning alone may help you land a spot if the group has yet to reach the instance.
---
Also, Banish (CC for Demons and Elementals) is great.
---
Not sure if hybrids were OP. As a warlock they challenged me in a way that only a rogue would in vanilla. But I do think healing became OP, at least in PvP. Arena's became too long for my taste.
---
I got it on my enhancement shaman on Nostalrius. Was an Orc, too. Felt like the angel of death.

Paladin warrior.

Ye, I agree, I like the Vanilla world more, but balance of TBC. 
---
Lord Kang the Decapitor is upset 
---
You don’t really use HoTs for raiding mate, they don’t stack and just end up overhealing.
---
To address each of these points
---
Both perform well in PvP; however soul link warlocks are among some of the most devasting specs to 1v1. If you're gonna be alliance, more than 25% of the horde will be Undead and make you cry each time they trinket and racial out of your fears. 
---
I don't think either is more desired in bgs because they have their specific utility. 
---
Going off vanilla stats, locks are more rarer than mages. You're also way less DPS than a mage until AQ/ZG so you might get picked up in a pug
---
I've played both I think they are both real fun. Warlocks are very easy to level and mages can aoe grind once they hit a certain level.
---
You should never spam sinister strike.
---
I felt the same way but I realized that I’ll be able to play both. I’m going to make characters on both sides and see which one I like better. 
---
Good threat bad mitigation, you can get crusing blows against you.

lol you got downvoted for an honest question and statement
---
The forsaken are not evil :(
---
There are instances in which you'd want to spam buttons, though.  Perhaps I should have been clearer.
---
Just like that 
---
TBC got a lot right with their talents, but also some major things wrong.
---
I think the best thing that TBC did was merging pve and pvp talents. Take a look at what they did with Defiance in the warrior prot tree. In vanilla, its 5 points for a talent that only really matters in raid tanking. TBC moves it to 3 points and staples on a expertise bonus. Now nobody's speccing into Defiance just for the expertise, but it's a nice bone to throw the tank spec warriors when their not tanking. Silent Resolve over in the priest tree is another good one. In Vanilla it was a flat threat reduction. TBC merges the threat reduction with a dispel resistance for your spells.
---
On the downside, TBC talents really started pushing us too far into the spec identity direction. Most every class had some 35point deep talent that was a massive boost to the core aspect of that spec, which ended up forcing people to go all the way into one spec and made you relatively far weaker in other aspects of your class. TBC didn't see nearly as many of the 21/21/x combinations that vanilla had.
---
However the biggest contributor to the overly spec identified TBC was mostly just the pure number of talent points. In vanilla you would land in the ballpark of 31/20, so you were only 50% more invested in your primary spec than secondary. Now with tbc you're looking at 41/20, or twice as invested in your primary spec. By WotLK you're up to 51/20, 150% more in primary spec than secondary. One can see how the talent system just didn't scale up well beyond 51 talent points and the later move to a stronger spec identity somewhat made sense.
---
Well, the hunter could just inform other party members then..
---
Warlock in the dead mines.  Spamming shadow bolt.  Guy PMs me "You going to use your dots?"

Right. So the rules for this discussion are: this sub's opinions are irrelevant, popular content creators' opinions are irrelevant, my personal experience is irrelevant, and the only trustworthy opinion is one guy who hasn't posted a single supporting source for "nah everybody is wrong, ulduar is actually trash.

Totally rational and reasonable to reject everything contrary to your opinions.

Solid advice, thanks!
---
Needs more Defias
---
Wall of the Dead was my first epic world drop from an undead in West Plaguelands. Got it on my druid and still have it to this day. Only thing is, I got it in TBC and not vanilla. 
---
So, I had an unusual idea for my hunter's professions to go Engineering + Blacksmithing.
---
Why Blacksmithing? Blacksmithing gives you a BoP, Blacksmithing required trinket which makes you immune to fear for 30 seconds. That's damned amazing for PvP. And what are the other alternatives anyway? There's mining, herbalism, skinning, or enchanting. All of them are useful as additional gold generation, but I'm counting on the hunter's natural strengths as one of the best farmers in the game to not need these for gold. 
---
Am I crazy or will I be broke doing this?
---
Great comment, I agree.
---
I think it is what I was getting at. I don't think Blizzard will do it for risk of alienating the community. But maybe as a patch to Classic after a bit, when people realize that certain things in Vanilla really were that bad.
---
And seriously, if people want an authentic vanilla experience, you would have to include things like the old hunter survival tree with lacerate. Yes, it was authentic, but people were very happy to get their class update, because it was much much better.
---
And likewise, people were very happy when TBC patch came out, because it felt like a class update for all 9 classes at the time.
---
Oh shit. 
---
That would never work because that’s like marking you’re ”interested in going” on a FB event lol :p
---
Not sure that is a radical opinion. When TBC came out everyone said that talent diversity and class balance was much better. It just doesn't have anything to do with the reason #Nochanges exists. Could you make Classic a better game than vanilla was? Absolutely, vanilla had numerous fundamental flaws that with 13 years of reflection are easy to fix. Does the community trust Blizzard to do so given the last 10 years? No, not a chance. 
---
I personally loved TBC, we had raids where no single person had the same spec (and by that I mean, not even the same main tree). Alliance Ret Paladins were probably the only thing that were not especially viable (better racial Seal, SoB caused you to take damage, which caused you to get healed, which gave you mana regen, Alliance ret had both lower DPS and mana issues), which means 26.5/27 specs had a reason to exist. Even Rogues had a Hemmorage build that, as a one of, increased RDPS and tank threat over their personal DPS loss. 
---
Horde warlocks have a big disadvantage in PVP actually because they have Shaman and you have Paladins.
---
They still do it in waves and not immediate bans usually, that would mean if the bots utilize trades, they could easily inject massive amounts of gold in the economy, I realize its depressing to think of all the way classic might go tits up, but this is probably a reality we have to face.
---
*WPVP* They are equal but different and endgame. A mage can escape more people and beat more melee at the same time, a warlock just flat out beats things that are on their screen. Locks are much stronger while leveling though because the mage aoe leveling spec kind of sucks at pvp.
---
*Premades* They are both wanted for but mage plays more of a utility role. You are frost spec in improved blizzard and you slow melee groups, spring flaggers, let them get away. You can beat people 1 v 1, but this is what you are best at. Locks have good utility in group fights but their strength is they just keep putting out never ending damage with a healer. They are like the warrior of casters.
---
*PUG raid* Both needed. Locks have banishes and a debuff/buff. Mages do superior damage IF they put 8 debuffs in tier 1 and 2. They have not stated that will happen. If it's 16 debuffs locks will put out similar damage. 
---
*Fun* Completely subjective and only you can answer this. Lock is more RTS and thinking. Mage is more FPS and flashy. People love both genres of games. Some people like both evenly so maybe class fantasy would be more important. Both classes have specs that can put up big numbers. Both have more defensive specs. Both classes excel in all forms of PvP. 
---
*Quality of life* This is a tough one. Both are very high. Neither is a class that is pigeonholed into only raiding for gear or only pvp. The blue pvp sets are great. Their raid sets are great (mage tier 1 sucks but after that it's better). There are classes that are pretty much forced to do one thing to get good gear for pvp. Ele Shaman would be one as they have no pvp set. There are also classes that straight up suck in gear that isn't good. Warrior would be a bad choice for really casual players. Lock and Mage have none of these issues and ranged dps always have a easier time getting invited to just about everything.
---
&gt;And when classic wow has better numbers than retail, you think investors will ignore it?
---
Theres no guarantee that classic will overrun retail. 
---
vanilla was so popular because of its timing.
---
I think this is something that will take care of its self. I remember back in the day we Alliance would wreak havoc, most of the time we outnumbered the Horde by a lot. To counteract that, the Horde would have full scale coordinated invasions, I swear their entire server seemed like it was in Redrige sometimes. What I'm saying is, there is never going to be a way to perfectly balance the populations, you just have to develop different strategies to cope. 
---
I was Alliance in Vanilla. Going Horde for classic. Horde has easier access to a lot of dungeons that I'm a fan of, for example:
---
Horde have all of these in their backyards. 
---
All of SM
---
Wailing Caverns
---
Ragefire
---
SFK
---
Sunken Temple
---
RFD
---
RFK
---
The problem is it's a slippery slope. It starts with just "hmm, these first zones need it" then goes to "hmm, Barrens and Westfall are pretty crowded...guess we'll add it there too" to "hmm, stranglethorn vale doesnt really match up with earlier zones' leveling experience, let's put sharding to smooth things out" to "well, 90% of zones are sharded anyways, let's just do it everywhere". Slippery slope. Or the George Lucas effect, as I like to call it. Constantly tweaking over and over and never knowing when to stop.
---
You should have Marie Kondo come over...
---
Right, I’m not sure what I dislike the most..
---
Okay it’s the CD’s. The CD’s are the worst.
---
You could toggle between the old and new models for all of WoD.
---
Gutripper, from pickpocketing the pirates outside booty bay.
---
There are private servers that have successfully mitigated the problem by adding a queueing system for a faction if its above 55% of the population.
---
I remember having to tip toe into Wailing Caverns to keep from getting ganked. It would be fun to just go there.
---
Shamans never had a ranged slot. Instead they had a class specific relic slot, which were called totems for the shaman specific relics.
---
They went into your bags and became unusable.
---
I think they are releasing the release date on the 17th. They aren’t going to release all of the games at once, first they are starting with Reach, then Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3 ODST, and then ending with Halo 4.
---
&gt;&gt;Maybe in 2-3 years
---
FTFY :)
---
There are many things that were better in those expansions, but we're not looking for the min/max best version of WoW. We're looking for vanilla.
---
Same for me. Got it grinding in my hunter. That was definitely the greatest "Super excited to immediately disappointed" moment in vanilla.
---
What post are you all referring to?
---
Not evil
---
I cant remember, I think it was a Twohanded Axe and I forget where it came from. 
---
Which Vanilla are you looking for? Even Vanilla had talent changes every patch or so?
---
People still sometimes stop attacking after a hunter feign deaths at low hp on private servers. They probably know about feign death but just thought the hunter legitimately died from someone else's damage. Always makes me laugh when I see it happen in BGs.
---
Grew up playing a human paladin. Thinking about playing at least the undead starting zones, just so I can understand the lore of the scourge a bit better.
---
Literally have like 5 posts that are "can't wait for classic" lol.
---
My bad; Morally grey
---
Wrath was worse than vanilla in this regard, since it was the expansion where all classes got homogenized, and they went away from combat revolving around threat.  
---
But I loved how they improved the weak specs from vanilla in TBC. Too bad everything else but the raids in TBC sucked.
---
Man, I don't even remember rollbacks happening in Vanilla. I remember lots of other bugs, though.
---
yeah we have been waiting way to long now.
---
And when you face alliance they have paladins that instantly dispel stuff with a dumb addon that plays for them. Alliance fear classes are not at a big disadvantage at anything unless you are a night elf priest because they don't have desperate prayer. They are like the worst race/class combination you can be.
---
For PVP don't play troll on horde (shadow priest is "ok" though). Don't play nightelf on alliance. The huge disadvantages were just bear. For further min maxing if you can be orc you be orc with the exception of ele shaman who can be tauren as well. If your class is a caster and can be a gnome you be a gnome. Warrior gnome/dwarf, rogue dwarf.
---
Alliance racials were never bad. The problem is that people play the wrong racials for almost everything. **Undead isn't even played by warriors or the best rogues on private servers. Only mages/priests roll undead in the new meta. Lock can beat both and if you are a gnome you escape a shatter combo.** 
---
If you judge healing purely by hps, you aren’t fulfilling your role effectively.
---
Me personally? That’s not true. And if you’re talking about in general, that’s fucking WONDERFUL to hear
---
The only thing that would fix faction imbalance is fixing the damn hunch on the horde races.
---
I can't get the exact vanilla I'm looking for so I guess I have to take what they're giving. 
---
I’M SO BORED AND ANTHEM SUCKS. 
---
BLIZZARD HURRY UP AND SAVE ME ONCE AGAIN!
---
I feel like the engi bit is for serious raiders. I never had engi as a tank and never had a problem, but I also wasn’t tanking raids (and won’t this time either) so it’s a moot point.
---
If raiding is your eventual goal as a MT or OT, then can level engi at that time. I did herb/alch before and will do it again, along with keeping up on cooking and first aid. I acknowledge it may not be the most efficient route, but it worked for me.
---
Dazzling Longsword from a ogre in Feralas. I was so excited I instantly equipped it on my Orc Hunter even though I didn't have a mount. 
---
Could've paid for my mount! Good times.
---
Which hybrids were OP? In progression guilds, the only hybrid spec being brought (outside of feral/paladin OT) was 1-2 shadow priests solely as mana batteries.
---
&gt; Vanilla WoW was an iterative process with constant balance passes. 
---
Preach.  Vanilla WoW from 2004-2006 had 27 viable specs for PvE and PvP because because everyone was bad, and it didn't matter what the mathematical limits of each spec were, because that information wasn't  widely available, and it was changing in balance patches every 3-4 months.  Modern day private servers have about 14 specs, because players are better, everything is known, and nothing is changing.  That's a pretty big change if you ask me. 
---
Anything promoting change gets downvoted around here.
---
Super excited to immediately disappointed is entirely accurate.
---
It was some crappy necklace with spirit if I remember correctly.
---
Held onto it for a long time. Don't think it was ever used.
---
If you have never experienced Totems and Windfury it's a no-brainer, go Horde
---
commenting to save for later
---
Sister and I are planning to play together, she has her heart set on Nelf rogue and because we want to quest from the start, I’m gonna roll night elf too. Was gonna go hunter but then we’d be competing for gear and level 40 takes forever anyway. What works well with rogue for faster leveling and mobkilling (and potential world pvp)? 
---
Was thinking of going Warrior since that’s my main class usually. How do priests fare with rogues?
---
Oh man! I totally thought this was going to be a post saying they need to change Deathknell and I was totally about to comment: Don't you fucking change Deathknell."
---
I love it. Might print it and hang it on my wall.
---
Great to hear.  I do eventually want to do raids but would prefer to do it with a more casual guild than I did in vanilla.  Might even end up making my own guild
---
No, this is my brain saying, that if I am going spend hundreds of hours playing Classic I should at least be able have the freedom to have fun and choose whatever spec I want, and still be able to be invited into raids and not be pigeonholed into a role I don't want.
---
Its just unlucky that it is worse than bonebiter and if you going to SM you dont just go there to farm arms, at least i hope you dont
---
Yeah I mean... going after absolute best possible AOE threat in a raid environment sure, go for sapper charges and FRD.  There aren't tons of examples where you need AOE threat on boss fights (Nef fight is one big example) but sure, might as well dump a small bit of gold into it to make the fight easier.   But you don't need that crap to do scarlet monastery or sunken temple!
---
This right here.  Unless you are running a private server and can check out how these people play in advance at various gear levels, you’re kind of jumping the gun.  Even then, we’re talking being at least 3 months out.  A lot of things can change during that time.
---
There’s also a question of whether you were recruiting for ferals, because not being able to read the recruitment is a big red flag, or not being specific with who you want to recruit is.  
---
&gt; If we slightly buff shitty hybrids through backporting proven talents from TBC, but they're still not strong enough to be "optimal" have we really threatened Vanilla? 
---
It is clearly not about that.
---
Firstly, if only SLIGHTLY BUFFING hybrids...they will STILL SUCK BALLS. So, a SLIGHT BUFF IS ILLOGICAL.
---
Secondly, what does SLIGHT actually mean?
---
A slight buff to hybrids will be irrelevant.
---
A bigger than slightly buff for hybrids is the equivalent of destroying Classic.
---
And anyway...WHY should hybrids be buffed in Classic? So they can be absolute MONSTERS in PvP, while IN THE SAME TIME, being preferred in raids above pure classes?
---
Vanilla class and spec balance WAS TE CLOSEST POSSIBLE TO what the word BALANCE means. Every single spec SUCKED at something, while being GREAT at something else.
---
This is TRUE BALANCE...and not EVERYONE DOING THE SAME SHIT.
---
Pre-nerf? MC and BWL should be buffed.
---
With the talent changes and general increase in player skill, these early raids will be a complete joke.
---
Yes, but Outland is absolute fucking garbage compared to Azeroth. Obviously pretty mutch all the shit-classes had some buffs in TBC to become more viable, and suprisingly have exactly what they were missing in vanilla to be playable.
---
But the same thing could easily be achieved in vanilla with tiny changes sometime after nax, and the eventual removal of the debuff cap which was just a technical limititation.
---
Oh and another thing, TBC is the worst factiong-imbalanced version the game has ever seen, there is absolutely no reason to roll alliance (no geographical advantages besides being slightly closer to Karazhan than horde is to CoT). All priests have fear ward, Belf pallies are superior. Horde have better PvE AND PvP racials across the board, and Outland is an awful continent for wpvp due to flying.
---
So 80-90% horde per server is not fun.
---
&gt;Different graphics affects the experience for everyone. Your avatar is an expression and extension of yourself, and everyone wants to be perceived in the same way. If I look stupid as a new model, I will feel compelled to toggle it on and off to make sure it looks fine on both. So it does affect me.
---
My point was that if you didn't use the toggle, which sounded like it given you were against it, then it wouldn't affect you if it was added or not. Gameplay-wise, it has no effect universally. 
---
&gt;You don’t know anything about what you’re talking about.
---
Okay

&gt;I am a server administrator with over 8 certifications and degrees and work on systems and clients like these every day. You are just an armchair fan spouting bullshit about shit you don’t know.

&gt;Patch notes for 1.10.0, introducing widescreen resolutions: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.10.0
---
Jackpot. Thanks for the link, I see it under the General items. Is there any more details on how far the resolution and refresh rate goes to? In 2006, widescreen and high resolution was generally for 1080p monitors. Resolutions like 2k, 4k, and anything in-between didn't really exist for consumers. I'd be impressed if they actually supported 4k 144hz at the time the patch was launched.
---
&gt; but druids have lower output on almost all fights by a huge margin
---
&gt; 1 record holding druid for hps in aq40. 
---
&gt; 1 record holding druid for bwl. 
---
&gt; 1 record holding druid for mc. 
---
&gt; 1 record holding druid for zg
---
So you disproved your own argument, congrats you.
---
0/10
---
Give back the bear!
---
Well, I wasn't a fan of TBC, especially the TBC "world". But I did like the talents, some new spells (not all), and the options that gave me.
---
I already know what class I'll be playing (all of them), I'm just doing it now to familiarize with the routes and landscape again.
---
For sure.  I can't wait to do ST again!
---
Go play a fresh pserver than. Thats what you are looking for. Never in Vanillas history did it involve 800 people in Northshire. You are confusing what was Vanilla with what your Vanilla pserver experience was like. 
---
It would have been interesting to see them expand the talent tree horizontally instead of vertically. 
---
So if nobody takes it... How is the guild supposed to have one?
---
I'm in the same boat man. Always played as Ally and have been thinking of changing because my friend was horde. The one thing I'll like is the feeling of having to read the quest and get a whole new perfective of lore and stories through the horde side. 
---
I'm not big into RP at all, but I'm a sucker for the early blizzard writing and still enjoy seeing how any story line comes together from silverpine onward. I don't know how much you've played since, but I feel I won't have as much burnout with so many new quest I haven't experienced.
---
For the love of god, listen to this man.
---
I've been rebutting the no changers with this line of thought for months now. Vanilla was a tumultuous experience that was never for a second static. No changes is not Vanilla like. Change my mind.
---
Thats mostly for TBC, not vanilla.
---
Alliance/horde have distinct faction advantages in vanilla so there is plenty of reasons to play either faction.
---
And most of it is nostalgia and overly hyped. People forget that Classic was basically an early access mess. Arcane didn't even have spells. Two of the 3 tanks sucked at tanking. You couldn't even use your spells against bosses  because they'd  overwrite other peoples spells. PvP was meaningless and had no direction at all
---
I mean i keep going i guess, the first raid had generally 1-2 mechanics meaning they were in essence training dummies from retail wow, the tank ones that attack you back. The entire 'ranks' of spells thing was a total failure, with most people not touching their last ranks of spells because it was just a massive waste of mana.
---
Gearing was a mess, too. Some BiS items came from low level dungeons and while i appreciate the 'go to all corners of the world to assemble the best gear' aspect, that absolutely is not what the developers intended. Thats why they created tiers of loot, epic, rare and so on.
---
About 70% of the druid class is a joke. They have all these cool talents for swapping forms a lot, then the forms costs so much mana you cannot possibly play that build at all.
---
There is a lot more i can say, but the point is this - if you're going to dissect TBC and Wrath and say how bad they were and that this was the start of the decline or whatever, you absolutely must look at vanilla that way too. People act like Vanilla was this perfect product. It wasn't. It was an early access mess that happened to be pretty fun and there wasn't any competition so it was the best by default. Another great example of this is Minecraft. It was one of a kind at launch, but it was dogshit if you look at it objectively. It had like 10 blocks, the AI was garbage, everything was buggy constantly and so on. Still mega popular.
---
&gt;its why classic exploded on the pserver scene
---
Another thing people forget is just how popular TBC and WoTLK servers were. People played them to death. There was constantly massive WoTLK servers around during Cata and MOP. I don't know about now, but i wouldn't be surprised if they were still around.
---
Vanilla caught the ire of streamers and exploded from that.
---

what's the name of the addon?

You don't know where they are and why his camera is jammed in like that.

Noob.

You could...
---
Face tank him on a SL Lock or Spriest. If dwarf spriest go immune to his bleeds for more lol's and have fear ward on when he desperately tries to fear me for the icing on the cake.
---
Take 2 minutes to beat him as a mage if he has a FAP pot.
---
Take 5 minutes to beat him as a druid.
---
On a rogue, uh don't bother unless you know they are bad or you are dwarf.
---
Faceroll him on a ret paladin.
---
Now if the question is what do you do if he has a pocket ele shaman who uses totems, drops windfury and offheals? You do what we do. You run your ass off. Unless you are also a warrior with a Holy Paladin healer. That's where the fun begins. Who wins? Crazy offense or defense. 
---
:)
---
Kill him with entangling roots. Slowly.

Bow of Searing Arrows. I got it on my Hunter when I first started leveling in STV. I remember losing my mind when I saw it drop and used it for a long time. God that brings back memories.
---
It did, until his girlfriend hit it with a Dundee.
---
Wel all know Alliance will be the dominant faction in Vanilla, because pretty races.
---
Thanks for answering all of my questions! Super helpful info.
---
I never really considered the amount of points you invest into your primary spec vs the secondary becoming so wide as the game went on. I mean its obvious but not at the same time. 
---
How could they have done this better? Allowing only x# of points per tree seems like a character limitation people wouldn't want. I guess not having 41 or 51 pt talents be as amazing would help. Maybe have more interaction across the trees, like druids and priests I feel had weaker high talent points and huge value through mana conservation or cast-time and haling that made Disc/holy and Resto/balance stronger. Of course demonic sacrifice always made locks spec fairly deep in demo.
---
Maybe you could increase costs of higher tier talents to 1.5 or 2 points?
---
I have digressed far from what classic is about. But thank you for your comment it made me reconsider some of what I liked about TBC and Wrath.
---
I wish I would of kept it. I sold it in TBC to buy my epic flying mount.
---
I'm just gonna say, if they made enhancement shamans truly viable tanks as a counterpart to paladins, it would be amazing.
---
I disagree, BC and Wotlk tree went too depth, you no longer had hybrid builds, you had to get the end tree talent of whatever role you were doing no matter what. And everyone was running about the same spec.
---
I feel that Wrath had some of, if not, the best zones and atmosphere in the game up until that point. I loved the Nordic inspiration for that xpac. However, it was the turning point where the casualization (is that a word?) began to creep in, to a fault. You win some you lose some.
---
&gt;It is clearly not about that.
---
It is for me? I don't really want a world where the hybrids are supplanting the best specs. I want them to be slightly better so that they won't be a gigantic burden on a raid, or totally unworkable in PvP. 
---
&gt;Firstly, if only SLIGHTLY BUFFING hybrids...they will STILL SUCK BALLS. So, a SLIGHT BUFF IS ILLOGICAL.
---
What? See my point above - buffs for hybrids could make them feel much better to play, even if they still suck balls. If you're dealing ~33% the damage of a warrior, it can feel shitty. If you're dealing ~70% of a warrior, it will feel WAYYYYY better, yet you would still be not even close to optimal and "suck balls."
---
&gt;A bigger than slightly buff for hybrids is the equivalent of destroying Classic.
---
How? Literally the balance of classic changed overtime. Pre 1.6, fury warriors were terrible (and it was 1.8 where they took off). Yet, believe it or not, patches 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, &amp; 1.5 were Vanilla WoW, and actually existed. It's not a conspiracy.
---
&gt;And anyway...WHY should hybrids be buffed in Classic? So they can be absolute MONSTERS in PvP, while IN THE SAME TIME, being preferred in raids above pure classes?
---
Uh no, that's really not the goal. I'm not sure where you're getting that from. Although reading this, I get the feeling you're somebody who thinks enhancement shaman WTF pwns in PvP, when in reality they're not even taken in a serious premade group. 
---
&gt;Vanilla class and spec balance WAS TE CLOSEST POSSIBLE TO what the word BALANCE means. Every single spec SUCKED at something, while being GREAT at something else. I dare you to give an example of a SINGLE SPEC in Vanilla that SUX at everything. Go on, prove me wrong.
---
A single spec? Okay at this point I think you must be trolling. But I'll play along - Enhancement shaman, Ret Paladin, Balance Druid...
---
&gt;Vanilla class balance was the closet possible to PERFECTION.
---
If this isn't a troll, this is a spicy-hot take. You're literally commenting in a thread where everybody is accepting the premise that TBC had better balance.
---
Gauging interest in a casual PVP guild. Mostly used to form premades or partial premades. Dungeon group forming as well. No real plans for raiding.
---
I don't have time to raid unfortunately, so it's pvp and dungeons for me since they don't require nearly as much coordination or commitment.  Looking for others in the same boat.
---
One of my first toons was a warrior, because I understood the concept is sword and shield. But I didn't understand group mechanics. So when I was around level 18 or so I got into a group for the deadmines. They thought I was the tank. But I didn't know what a tank was. One of them told me that it was my job to go first and get hit. I thought it was a scam. He pointed out sunder armor. After trying it I found out that the mob wouldn't stop attacking me if I used it. I ran all the way back to the entrance trying to lose agro. Left the group. Deleted the character. 
---
You are a wizard
---
Needs more caps lock, you off your meds?
---
Specs could simply be made viable.  Enhancement shaman is a perfect example.  They clearly had a tanking role for them in mind, but it just doesn't quite work.  If they made them viable tanks on par with druids and paladins at least though 0-60 content, it would be a perfectly reasonable change.
---
Druid works really well with rogue but you have the gear issue.  Priest would be good too though, as rogue can be kind of squishy
---
&gt;It’s called a ratio. Aspect ratio. The client supports up to 120hz. I have also personally ran 4K 60hz.
---
Yeah, we have some weird widescreen ratios now. I'm impressed the client supported up to 120Hz, but I guess not so much given how high the refresh rate the old CRT monitors were. 
---
&gt;You should work on your communication skills, intern.
---
I just deleted that thread a few minutes ago. While it's weird that you got mad enough to resort to ad hominem and going through post history, I'm not really concerned. I hope you find the answers you're looking for and wish you well in becoming the best you can be.
---
If you think three YouTube videos(one of which has 1800 views and the other directly contradicts your statement by placing it at #2), your opinion and me getting downvoted for posting a scathing 6 paragraph essay on why Wrath is a terrible expansion is supporting evidence to the statement that "Ulduar is widely considered to be the best raid of all WoW" then you are the one randomly moving goalposts, not me, and doing some preliminary finger pointing that sounds an awful lot like insecure projection is just coming off as creepy and weird.
---
&gt;only trustworthy opinion is one guy who hasn't posted a single supporting source for "nah everybody is wrong, ulduar is actually trash.
---
You know what? You're completely right. I'll upload a video to YouTube this evening about how Wrath is shit and Ulduar is garbage, and then you'll have your "single supporting source". Clown.
---
Mom's gonna fix it all soon.  
---
Mom's comin' round to put it back the way it ought to be.  
---
I'm planning to put together something like that if there is interest. I don't have time to raid, but pre-made PVP groups and dungeons are much easier to coordinate. I had a similar guild on a private server.
---
I mean it's a Shaman which has a self rez..so actually it's really easy for him to heal that damage.
---
Funny mine was also Kang, got it off one of [these mobs](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5481) in Tanaris.  I am hoping to get at least one BoE blue or epic on my way to 60 in classic.
---
Okay... In Classic WoW, the forsaken are not evil.
---
Talents for PvE *AND* PvE???
---
Hehe, typo. Will check it out though.
---
Why not Felcloth Gloves ?
---
Pre-BIS Gear Phase 1(Not ingame until P2+)
---
Soul Harvester, Crimson Felt Hat, Green Lens, Draconic Infused Emblem, Tome of the Lost, Burial Shawl, Shroud of the Nathrezim, Robe of Volatile Power, Sorcerous Dagger, Spirit of Aquementas
---
My thoughts exactly. I'd love to use his maps for a D&amp;D campaign based in WoW but not if I only have a few because he deleted the rest.
---
The ratio for 4K is still 16:9 just as an aside. 
---
What I am trying to get at, is don’t try to explain to me topics that you think you’re educated on, but are not. 
---
If you’re going to be snooty, you should at least be correct. 
---
All healers have DPS talents, use those. Then respec at 60. Shadow for priest, feral for druid, retribution for paladin and enhancement for shaman.... It's that simple. 
---

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/
---
I completely agree,
---
That is why the TBC merging of talents, making 3 instead of 5 points, or switch positions of talents is something I hope Blizzard will consider in Classic after some months (mainly to not alienate the community, and so that we can re-experience and rediscover the major flaws in vanilla, and tweak them.
---
Regarding the number of talent points, they should be limited to 31. As to not push spec identity to the limit. 41 in vanilla is too much and only existed in patch 2.0.1. People should able to go 21/21/x and it should be fun.
---
This resource is mostly accurate. Pre-bis list is slightly off in a few areas, will depend on how Blizzard handles itemisation (different to loot tables).  
---
Rotation for grinding also depends on how long the mob is expected to live. Siphon Life into CoA into Corruption is better if the mob is living about 30s or if you're chain pulling and it's enough to kill, skip siphon/agony if it's dying really fast.  
---
\- t. 60 warlock
---
Another problem is that in retail wow, epics are nameless. This got incredibly exaggerated by titanforging in legion (In WoD there was at least a sort of progression to things and people knew what items they wanted, especially trinkets in BRF and HFC). In vanilla, there are blues and even greens that everyone will reckognize by name (carrot on a stick). Nowadays I doubt many people will remember the name on items from a tier ago, with a very few exceptions like legions "Arcano Crystal". This is because you don't hunt for a specific item, because any item titanforging is your new BiS.
---
Rogue is probably the best example how impactful talent trees can be while lvling, I still stand by rogue being the worst class to lvl in the early game (yes, worse than warriors) up to like lvl ~35 ish, where they get some very valuable talents that improves their lvling a lot.
---
Things as simple as CD reduction on sprint/evasion (so you can fight 2-3 mobs every 3 min as oppose to  every 5 min), sword specilization, disarm etc.
---
It makes a huge difference.
---
Nobody has mentioned this, but in PvE raids druids usually get geared with full epics the fastest because their gear drops like candy, and there's usually only 1 or 2 druids in a raid to compete with for +healing/int leather gear. Priests have to compete with 8 other priests in a raid, plus 8 mages, plus 4 warlocks all for the same +int cloth. So priests are one of the slowest classes to gear up with raiding epics.
---
Yes, they were. In PvP.
---
I am amazed that most people are simply disregarding PvP when asking for "slight" buffs for hybrids.
---
You know...WoW raiding scene was (and still is) the SMALLEST part of the game.
---
If anyone thinks that buffing hybrids for PvE won't absolutely make them monsters in PvP...it's a moron.
---
The important talents come at 11, 21, 31 and maybe 15.  Those are typically where you'll get a new ability or major passive.
---
You can basically just save up points until those break points and not really notice. 
---
If it was a year ago or more it wouldnt have mattered as much, but its only months away. Definitely not worth playing right now , if you play now it will leave an empty hole feeling when you need to reinvest all that time into a new character come classic launch. I havent played since june of last year and the wait is worth it, trust.
---
While absolutely fucking up the PvP scene.
---
Vanilla class and spec design was the closest to the meaning of word "balance".
---
Very hyped to play a Shaman come vanilla!!!!
---
&gt; Does the community trust Blizzard to do so given the last 10 years? No, not a chance.
---
Why do you think that? I haven't played Wow since 2010 so I don't know what the community is like now. But I also play Warcraft 3, and Blizzard has been making some healthy patch changes there, allowing for this RTS game to evolve outside of what was the meta for nearly a decade.
---
I'm surprised by your comment, as it's not what I remember at all, outside of welfare epics.
---
LFD was a super popular idea at the time, so there wasn't much complaints about it, and BTW LFG was pretty much unused until the ICC patch and the 3 ICC dungeons. People just spammed the Dalaran /2 channel "LFG daily Heroic" - else they didn't run heroics much anyway.
---
I don't even remember people complaing about Naxx, as it is said in some comments, outside of the lag on Saphirron. WotLK's Naxx was supposed to be made hard by the local achievements, which rewarded you the Black/pPlagued proto-Drakes, which are super rare to this day. Blizz tested achievements becoming a difficulty meter for raiding in Naxx, that's why "just cleaning it" was easy. If the achievements were this easy, more people would have these mounts, which isn't the case.
---
PvP was at its peak in WotLK. S8 layed the foundations to the most competitive PvP environment played by all the best multiglads in the world ; Arena Tournament. The game was the most balanced ever past the DK initial nerf.
---
The questlines and lore were extremely rich. Zones and music were brilliantly made. The tools given to classes, from double spec to cool end of the talent three skills, were warmly welcomed by the community. Achievements were also pretty popular. 
---
As somebody who did a lot of PvP and liked to hang around, I loved WotLK. It's true that looking litterally 10 years back I know realize many things could have been better and that Wrath started going in the wrong direction in several regards, but claiming that it was all rage and complaints when it came out is simply not true.

---
MC is ridiculously easy with 1.12 talents and proper knowledge. You have no idea.
---
Thanks for all the replies classic community! I'm super surprised how pro warlock everyone is, not a whole love for the mage in the comments XD. All of the info you guys gave me will weigh heavily on my decision.
---
Disagree about the professions.  Take tailoring and enchanting, craft brown linen robes to level and DE and you'll still have your wand before level 10.  It's really not that crucial; getting to 10 takes about 2 hours, shaving 10 minutes off of that isn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things.
---
And actually, if you're leveling as undead, or just through the undead zones, you should take herbalism before tailoring to make the doomweed/gloomweed quests easier.
---
HYPE OVERWHELMING!!!
---
&gt; nor is it what the no-changers are asking for. What they want is a recreation of their private server experience, not a recreation of WoW as it was. 
---
This might be the best point I've seen made here in a while, as it actually explains the drive behind these folks for once.
---
Well, but if the "changes" are all known before anyway, then it doesn't make sense also, no? (eg. progressive talent changing as they were changed in vanilla)
---
It would have to be a whole new set of balance updates.
---
OH man if they swapped one thing, moving TM to the very bottom of the prot tree and letting you keep 10 rage by default was AMAZING. The way things are now it just pushes you so strongly into arms its hard to resist.
---
TBC is the pinnacle of WoW being an amazing game. It's literally built upon the lessons learned in WoW. The only thing that was pretty awful was PvP stuff :re mace specialization and sap+cyclone cycle cheese.
---
But we have to have classic first if we want TBC reloaded.
---
No, leveling as balance is garbage.  Chicken form is really good in the context of leveling as balance.
---
Surely just engineering and anything if pvp.
---
Am I 60? If so then I kill him. If I'm not 60 or 50+  then I run away. 
---
\&gt; The ratio for 4K is still 16:9 just as an aside.
---
I understand, I just remember seeing some weird aspect ratios that weren't supported just added (I think 21:9, can't remember).
---
\&gt; What I am trying to get at, is don’t try to explain to me topics that you think you’re educated on, but are not. 
---
I feel that I am educated on this, so I tried to explain it. You gave me some blanks to fill in and I appreciate that. It's inspired me to deep dive further after work so I can better understand the specific of patch 1.10 and what they mean specifically by "widescreen support"
---
\&gt;If you’re going to be snooty, you should at least be correct.
---
For this, I will apologize. I read your earlier replies as snooty too, but perhaps I misread. Text is hard to communicate emotion with outside of being blunt (insulting someone). I was never angry, but I felt I needed to come to the defense of the person you replied to. However, you ended it in being extremely insulting. I can take things in stride, but targeting someone on an event that is detrimental to their livelihood and gives them such uncertainty goes beyond a simple argument on the internet. 
---
I’m prayin for rain and 
---
An elemental mage.
---
&gt;There is no telling what kind of butterfly effect buffing something like Balance Druids could have on the game.
---
Shit like that literally might end the world...
---
The only effect something like that might have on it's own is making more people enjoy the game.
---
All that being said, if this is half as successful as everyone here wants to believe it will be, the clamor to fix classes will be OVERWHELMING.
---
I would like to see class balancing progress through future patches 1.14, 1.15, etc.
---
Vanilla was not static. It was constantly changing, updating, rebalancing. Asking for vanilla is also asking for the continuous development that drove it.
---
I don't want 51/20/0 specs, that would make no sense at level 60. I still want 31 talent points max. What I am saying is, what TBC and Wrath got right was that they repositions talents, merged others, and changed 5 point talents to 3 points. Stuff like that make a huge difference in character diversity and viability.
---
I really began playing the game in WotLK. I dabbled in WoW during Vanilla/BC but never even hit max level. Since Wrath I have been a Feral Druid and plan to play Druid in classic. 
---
I care more about class fantasy/hybrid playstyle of druid and will be leveling/PvPing as Feral 100%. I know Feral DPS has a bad wrap in vanilla unless you have the correct gear/powershift/consumables. My question is, do you think it will be possible to raid as Bear/Kitty instead of Bear/Resto?
---
I enjoy Bear tanking as well and will probably use that to farm dungeons and such early. Just not sure what gear and professions to focus on first to make gearing out Bear/Cat efficient.
---
Thanks for the input.
---
I would only add that healing dungeons 40+ in a DPS spec can be a pain when the tank is also a DPS spec.  So while you can do it, it will test your skill.
---
AWWWWUHHHHH
---
Sorry about that, it was too far and that’s my bad. I was a bit on the defensive myself solely because people who don’t know any better will try to destroy a game based on their misunderstandings. This game is enormously important for me for several deeply personal reasons and I feel a need to defend it from those who would do it harm. 
---
Does that sound stupid, maybe. But sometimes it compels me to be stricter with others than I’d otherwise be. 
---
There are a lot of people who would destroy this game based on perceptions and I want to bring facts and logics to the forefront. 
---
Finally, yes, new aspect ratios are weird. Mostly just ultra wide and super ultra wide. 21:9 and 32:9. They are approximations but pretty close. 
---
Surprisingly the 1.12.1 client does permit Ultrawide with some fiddling. The FoV gets a bit messed up, but you can fix it with a small tweak. 
---
My argument has always been if it’s in the 1.12.1 client it should be brought over to this. 
---
A graphics model and animation toggle did not exist in 1.12.1, thus it should not exist. 
---
Yes I’ve been told about 500 times. Thank you. 
---
Agreed, nothing over the top, but just incremental changes like we experienced in Vanilla when a new patch came out.
---
Poor hunter, the 6th person in the shot, i. e. not part of the party.
---
Completely agree, I've been saying this for well over a year now, if Blizz's plan is to further develop classic by adding TBC and Wrath, Wrath needs MAJOR changes.
---
No wonder I didn't recognize it, I played Alliance.  
---
God thank you so much!  I absolutely HATE when subs turn into this nonsense.  I remember back when league first came out all that was posted were people discussing strats/posting cool videos/and the occasional link to the nikosaur update.
---
Go there now and it’s fucking trash posts filled with things like.... Doublelift said: “I think this team is really good”
---
Fuck that 
---
Leveling in Vanilla isn't a *hard* thing to do, but it is time-consuming. A new player can probably expect to spend 8-15 days /played before they ding 60, and experienced players can fall in the 5-10 days /played range. Obviously, depends on class, leveling route, and whether someone is trying to level quickly vs. stopping to smell the roses.
---
With that said, picking non-ideal talents won't make things that much *harder* for you, but can slow you down. If you're having fun, though, does it matter that it takes you longer to ding 60? It just means you're spending taking longer having fun... which seems like a win to me.
---
tl;dr: Doesn't matter if you aren't speed-running the leveling process. Just pick talents that seem fun.
---
You're arguing that buffing prot paladins (and other useless specs) *just right* is impossible.
---
How do you explain TBC-level of balance when it comes to paladins?
---
Your "proposed" change of just buffing mana regen is really short-sighted. Yes, you're right - it can't be solved with this. But it is really a [straw-man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) argument. Can you *really* not imagine better, the most optimal way how to buff prot paladins without breaking the game? What if you had gun to your head and *had to* think about buff for them. What would you think then? Then use *that* as your argument at least. And even then - you're not even professional game designer and have not the knowledge of the game Blizzard has.
---
I really think the problem of keeping vanilla class balance true to its current nature and making some of the garbage specs at least viable is unsolvable.
---
ps.: Not arguing for changes or against, just disputing this guy's argument. Whether even if there is optimal solution, it should be implemented, is whole another matter.
---
These are the real quality of life changes we forgot about :) 
---
I think some people are gonna be surprised when Classic arrives.
---
For most content crushing blows won’t be as big as people think they are. Druids get a bad rep because for a good portion of vanilla beer form was garbage. In classic you’ll see more of them. They are for sure not as good as a warrior in most situations though
---
&gt; Most raid healers on progressive content have to sacrifice their solo play
---
same for tanks
---
you need a 2nd 60 for farming
---
#DO NOT DELETE THE POSTS!  
---
Seriously, mate, let the crybabies cry, if they are not interested, they can scroll down!
---
Dropped from Ambassador Flamelash in BRD, right?
---
*But you instantly got max level and epic-quality equipment! What's not to like? You didn't even have to play the game!*
---
Blizzard, probably.
---
Just go druid. Like a rogue you have the benefit of picking your fights, faerie fire is a rogues worst nightmare, entangling roots, dispel poisons, dire bear form, immune to polymorph and can shift out of roots. Can finish enemies off with range damage. You are way less gear dependant than other classes, your weapon is just a stat stick. Watch Stormx on youtube. 
---
And those people are killjoys.  I loved the subtle glow on my Mageblade.  
---
So the pro-sharding crowd has gone from claiming sharding will be fine if it "lasts a week" to "it'll be fine if it's only on for a month or two" now. 
---
What's next?
---
If you were Alliance you were never really epic 
---
&gt; had 27 viable specs for PvE and PvP because because everyone was bad
---
This is the real truth
---
In that video it looks like they split into two 20-person groups and then go do different bosses simultaneously.
---
Are they able to do this because they have everything practiced and memorized, or because they are overgeared for the instance?
---
I was trolling.
---
It says in the Guide to choose orc over undead, because if the PVP trinket, that basically gives you WOTF.
---
My questions are:
---
- does WOTF have a shared cooldown with the PVP trinket in classic?
---
- (being an engineer) is having an extra trinket slot not a big plus for undead?
---
It's better to learn to pre-cast and cancel heals.  Cast time reduction on heals isn't super useful prior to 60.
---
Hi, I am choosing between Warlock and Hunter. So far I am leaning towards hunter but am still unsure. I have played retail wow from BC but only started playing properly from cata to WoD. I played pvp more than pve, but did enjoy raiding and I think the most I did was getting ahead of the curve in heroic raids (never completed a mythic raid). So, I am not a hardcore raider but I will definitely raid if its the best way of getting gear and to experience vanilla raids.  My thinking:
---
Hunter pros:
---
Fast levelling
---
Rotation seems engaging/kit looks interesting
---
You need a couple at least in pve for utility
---
They are good in pvp
---
Efficient gold farmers
---
Farming for the best pets potentially fun
---
Never played a hunter before so will be a new experience
---
Cons:
---
Damage falls off hard so they aren't that desirable for raids outside of a couple for tranq shot.
---
Farming for the best pets might be tedious
---
Seems like Night Elves make the best hunters and I'm used to early levelling in human zones (not really an issue I just feel like I'll be much slower when I don't know the zones)
---
Not sure if I can pvp and gold farm in a pve spec, it would be nice to not have to respec a lot
---
Warlock pros:
---
Very desirable in raids, high damage and good utility
---
Extremely strong in pvp 
---
Good levellers (not sure if good at farming gold)
---
Get a free level 40 mount
---
SM/ruin very good all round build for pve and pvp
---
Seems fun in pvp with cc/curses
---
Boring pve rotation (I have heard you spam shadowbolt for all pve content)
---
Must farm soul shards before raids 
---
I have played Warlocks before - not new
---
Worse gold farmers than hunters (not sure by how much)
---
Uninstall the gear score add on. Don’t bring this plague of people blindly following gear score when lesser score items are way better in Vanilla.
---
I liked both of those additions, but those are both the 41 deep talent in WotLK for Fury and Survival. No BC
---
I feel the same way you do, only I never got to see Naxx in classic.  The Naxx we got in WotLK was a detuned nerfed raid that you could easily pug.  I raided through MC, BWL, AQ, ZG, but never got to see Naxx in its hayday.
---
Classic is a fantastic way for all of us to get second chances.
---
I hope we get class night again.  I don't remember it being exactly "dark", but it was certainly much darker than what we get in modern WoW.  
---
A warrior by himself? 
---
Lmao I’ll kill him 
---
priest is a pretty good match, but so is everything else. with hunters and druids you'll run into gear problems, however.
---
btw, if you're alright with leveling in the dwarven starting area (or human, but that's quite a walk), you can play together right from the start. (or at least before level 10)
---
from the night elf starting area, one should run to Rut'Theran Village, port to Auberdine, take the boat to Menethil Harbor, then start swimming south by the shore. for a long, long time. when the area changes to Dun Morogh, just drown yourself.
---
welcome to Ironforge! hope you got all the flight points on the way there, otherwise you're not getting out for quite a while.
---
You forget other important events like AQ opening and Scourge Invasion etc. Sharding should not be in the game, period.
---
pretty sure I did...it was a long time ago so I could be mistaken
---
&gt;Sorry about that, it was too far and that’s my bad. I was a bit on the defensive myself solely because people who don’t know any better will try to destroy a game based on their misunderstandings. This game is enormously important for me for several deeply personal reasons and I feel a need to defend it from those who would do it harm.
---
It's okay. I understand. This game is important to me to. It got me through rough times in my childhood and I would love to play it again and experience the open world and amazing friends that I made.
---
I can also understand that you want a strict and accurate recreation of the experience down to the letter. I respect that and (as being someone more in the middle) I think opinions like yours are important in keeping the original goal of this project in mind. I want nothing but to see this project succeed, even if our views are a bit different.
---
As another question, would you actually want them to include the higher end screen support beyond what 1.12.1 was capable of? How do you feel about the right-click report feature or the server sharding? Lastly, was it decided if [battle.net](https://battle.net) would be integrated? I feel that'd be important to hash out if it'll be included or not.
---
Retail brain*
---
I agree. Can't fucking wait.
---
If players are expected to get flasks and sharpening stones and whatever else for raid prep then I don't think it is out of the question to have them buy food/drink as well. It is only until dire maul comes out.
---
yea that's right
---
That's clearly his old character on retail right now man.
---
Holy shit if people in this sub accepted someone at least having this opinion, it would be heaven.
---
I love Vanilla. The (single) world, the stories, the feel, the world PvP (no flying mounts), the raids, the dungeons, the PvP balance (no resillience), the art (no bright ugly spaceman crap), the cities, the gear, everything.
---
But I can still accept that it had flaws and the class balance was actually better in TBC (for example paladins).
---
No seriously. Sharding is the worst one, so either come up with a better solution or don't suggest it at least.
---
Lots of emotion there, buddy. Let's keep this rational, OK?
---
1) I grabbed the top 3 videos Google recommended. It's not a scientific proof, but usually when the highest-rated content creators agree "X is a top-tier contender", it's suggestive that X isn't trash. If you can get a video up to that spot, I'll give some ground. And are you suggesting 2nd-place is closer to trash than my position?
---
2) Pick your battles... When I replied to 2 points of your spiel, you tacitly accepted a discussion on those points. Everything since then has been me providing support for my premise &amp; you declining to provide support for yours. If you want to concede those points it doesn't mean your 6-paragraph essay is null and void. But I get a laugh at watching people choose ludicrously undefendable positions as their hill to die on :)
---
Oh my god that brought back sooo many memories. the trek from teldrassil to dun morogh to SW to westfall is super nostalgic, definitely doing that on a future night elf alt for quicker rep gains and because Duskwood is my alltime favorite questing zone! 
---
nice, need a shadowglen!
---
Everyone is flat out 
---
W r o n g 
---
26/25 is perfectly viable for healing any raid in vanilla and one Paladin per raid should be expected to have this spec for blessing of sanc. Be that guy. You lose 5% crit but you won’t have any mana issues if your guild is good. 
---
Even with deep holy tho you can farm lashers in Dire Maul and make 20ish gold an hour which is fine. Can be done 100% solo. 
---
Farm lashers while solo, but also find a group for strat live farming. 
---
I can't wait to stumble across aspects of the game (areas/items/quests) that I have forgotten about. For example, I am considering leveling a warrior and completely forgot about the whirlwind axe and how badass it was. I feel like there will be many more moments like that as I quest to 60.
---
You can actaully just level as sub it's not as bad as it's made out to be. Or you can start combat and then respec when you want to have fun.
---
Hey all :)

BC-Cataclysm player excited for the return of OG wow! That being said here are my stats:
---
Region: EU
---
Server type: Normal
---
Intended faction: Alliance

Intended raid/play times: CEST, variable depending on college semester schedule but I’m pretty consistent :)
---
No real guild priority but raiding would be nice and a good community!

DM me on discord @sammany or here!

Someone asked about realm pop caps at the Blizzcon Q&amp;A, and they said something like "It has never actually worked that way."

No no he’s talking about the *lunch* experiences.

Sylvanus is more like fifty shades of gray.
---
You don’t need 30 points in holy for any raid lol. MAYBE AQ / Naxx but there will still be at least one 25/26/0 Paladin for Sanc. 
---
Still tho losing the 5% crit isn’t a huge deal if you have the right gear. 
---
I'm going Orc warrior. Gonna feel amazing to hit 60.
---
Holy paladins can farm lashers in dire maul super easy. 
---
If they were planning for it from the beginning, they could have namespace shared between known pools of servers. 
---
Classic comes out when I'm about to start one of the most important years of my life that will influence my future and yet I can't wait to walk the line of addiction once again haha
---
&gt; We want the game, not the jank.

&gt; #NoChanges can fuck off. I want a nice 2019 experience with my 2006 game please.
---
Agreed. We can absolutely polish things up a little without compromising what really makes it Classic. 
---
With what lol. Conc? That sounds terrible. 
---
Does heirloom gear exacerbate the issue on live servers? If so then maybe it won't be as big of a problem in classic?
---
I don't know man, I go the apothecary area and see all those chained alliance being turned into slimes and having done the new plague quest chain, it begs to differ. The horde are definitely not evil. Hell, maybe the forsaken aren't truly evil, but the forsaken operate by different ethical/moral standards. One that most people would detest. 
---
If I do decide on warrior I think I'm going to roll human. All I want is the awesome Quel'Serrar sword. Always thought it looked so awesome.
---
Battle.net is most definitely in. This reason was one of the primary ones to downport the 7.3.5 client to Classic. It has a lot of security fixes and the client/servers will need to be kosher with the rest of the Blizzard products in the "Blizzard network."
---
I personally feel hardware issues are irrelevant to most of the debating here, considering by and large it's just bug fixing. A higher resolution or aspect ratio does not change the world. It's the same polygons, same world. Can you see more of the world at one time? Maybe, but it's still the same world and graphics. 
---
Right click reporting is dangerous. People will be unable to help themselves and will report people for things that are annoying, but not against ToS or griefing. Blizzard with their limited resources for support will allow the automated systems to regulate, and this would have a negative affect. I'd rather the system not be there at all. Even TipsOut, who is staunchly against right click reporting, erroneously did it during his duel tournament in the classic demo for something that was annoying but not against ToS or griefing.
---
Server sharding in the opening zones for the first week or so is an absolutely necessity. Blizzard and Ion know that sharding is antithetical to Classic and it would not leave the starting zones. This will allow the population of people who plan to stay be congregated together on lesser servers, so when tourists leave they won't have to deal with either merging servers (reverse phasing) or having a dead low-pop server.
---
I don't like server sharding and it is not ideal, however I firmly believe it is the lesser of the evils to fix the problem, plus Blizzard already has this tech developed.
---
I'll see you in STV then ;)

---
how attached are you to the idea of healing? I've played priest for a long, long time (mostly as shadow, but even when healing in PvP, my playstyle was *very* offensive), yet I'm still pretty sure I'm going to roll a mage as a main.
---
it's also a clothie and it let's you be a menace in different yet similar ways, so... what's not to like?
---
Man i miss WoW...but not sure i would give it another chance. I played for 8 years but the changes to talents, the constant nerfing and buffing, the inefficient RNG....it became tedious to play instead of fun. 
---
Not saying it's a bad MMO, just not for me anymore. 
---
Felcloth gloves are great!

The recipe is unfortunately not available until Phase 2

---
I think it goes against the spirit of the game. Blizzard added a limit to how many times you can start a fresh instance to combat it. There will always be people who want to play in that fashion though, so what can you do?

That would be pretty cool. I was thinking the other day an alternative to TBC and Wrath trees going deeper is to add a 4th tree. Not saying it should happen, but it was an interesting idea.
---
It shouldn't be too much more difficult to put something on the hunter so they can't be healed of buffed either.
---
Hunters are objectively bad raid dps beyond BWL based on itemization alone. AQ40 may as well not even exist for hunters and you don't see a weapon upgrade from BWL all the way til the end of Naxxramas. Players who remember Hunters being kings in vanilla only raided in early progression before they were outscaled or were simply in guilds where the average skill/knowledge disparity between players was too large for any real class comparisons to be made.
---
Many people thought this way until they played on a private server and realized the game still has so much magic even after all these years.
---
It's both, honestly. It depends what server you play on. Both dynamic node spawns and the overspawning of rare nodes both have a significant contribution to the devaluation of silver, gold, and truesilver.
---
If someone was determined to eradicate me and my entire species I’d have a hard time finding any moral or ethical reason for not turning them into slime.
---
Uhhhh the right gear? Which you don't in the early phases you claim to not need the crit? You will be outperformed by every other paladin in the raid. Each paladin in a decent guild will go for different buff talent increases based on their assignment. Blessing of Sanctuary is the 21 talent, so the ONE paladin going that build still goes 30 holy. Crit = BEST stat for paladins followed very closely by +healing. There is no such thing as enough crit or losing crit being a good thing to a paladin healer. 
---
Gonna have to question your expertise here. Again, it is fine to go less outside of raid, but you're being a genuinely bad healer and guildmate if you are running less than 30 holy.
---
They were both announced in 2017. Coincidence? I think not!
---
Yet, [here I am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUzWiQF1fMg&amp;t=3s) with my guild in retail vanilla getting in top 5 on the most difficult raid boss in vanilla history. 
---
Twin Emps was also a Top 5 fight for me that I remember. Basically if there was no adds = I always get Top 5-7, with adds I get pushed down. It's that simple, AQ/Naxx introduced more fights with adds but there was still plenty of single target fights. 
---
I cannot believe some people still believe ''feral druids dont work'' ''cant play balance druid'' ''cant tank as paladin or do dps as ret'' There has been TONS of videos, threads and everything demonstrating the very real viability of these specs in both PvE and PvP. Now the great thing about vanilla talents is the fact that you can actually make your very own spec to your own specific playstyle. I main a mage in vanilla and i can make 20+ different good specs for different situations. Even all these years later people on private servers are still discussing what specs are best (like as a mage CL i often had to discuss, compete and show the people not using coldsnap spec in MC/bwl that it's better).  If YOU are incapable of playing a certain class in classic its ONLY because you are not good enough at the game to realize what you need to do.
---
A lot of people really enjoy using the lowlevels items, right consumes, macros and rotations to do feral dps in vanilla for example. If you made it easy like you want it to be i think a lot of people would get sad.
---
Sub has some real nice synergies, particularly in regards to talents like Imp Sap he was talking about. Often when questing you'll have camps of mobs and need to sap one. Imp sap will let you sap a mob and still get off your opener. This then lets you take advantage of the Opportunity or Improved Ambush talents, maybe even get an Initiative Proc if you specced that way. I'm a huge fan of leveling sub, sure it's not as strong at ripping through mobs 1 at a time like combat, but there's just more you can bring to the table than raw damage.
---
blizzard entertainment world of warcraft battle for azeroth
---
Very true. Healer and tank duo farms are very common and quite viable post T2 level gear. Things get crazy fun. 
---
In regard to solo play it doesn't get much better at any point unless you keep a full epic dps set and even then it feels weak unless you respec.
---
Fo'sho, I just had. no idea they removed ALL *ranged slot items.
---
Same thing happened on my 29 rogue twink i had in Vanilla and early on in TBC.  first thing i noticed was a bunch of my bars where missing and my bow in my bags instead of equipped.  
---
Was a sad day.
---
&gt; as still still trying just as hard and people above me weren't mailing it in but definitely not putting in as much effo
---
Problem with rogue in PvE back in vanilla was competition. There were tons and tons of rogues. It was like the most popular class, and it was difficult getting into 5-man dungeon groups (unless you are good with putting together your own groups). In raids, it was similarly difficult to win a raid spot. Maybe classic will be different, but I'd guess not a lot different. If you're cool with that, go rogue. But more warrior (tanks) are needed and appreciated.
---
Good point about the sets, I guess that less focused stat distribution was more of a thing back then that the game itself encouraged. In fact I might even have thought about those sets while mix and matching the low level gear. Maybe only in retrospect does taking strength gear on a (off and on) caster seem so bizarre, looking back after years of high end raiding. I like this take!
---
Yeah, one of them was a 40 man and one was 25. The 40 man had to have been a lot harder for the number of people involved alone.
---
Agreed. I am looking forward to leveling a frost mage. Never played the class and am looking forward to getting through dungeons with a single button.
---
I pretty much agree with all of what you stated. I'm not a fan of server sharding, but I imagine not many servers will be stood up and that would cause some major population density problems in quest areas. When that smooths out, I'd definitely be in favor for sharding to be disabled.
---
As for battle.net, I see and understand. I view it as a double-edged sword socially. 
---
I'm torn on the right-click report function. I know people will be dicks, but yeah, lots of room for abuse and I don't see it going well. However, what could an alternative be?
---
Thanks for sharing your input, I like seeing people's opinions on the matter. It helps me understand the situation and better define where I stand.

---
Please post your previous ones, i'd love to save these and I just discovered your work.
---
Which addon?
---
One last thing- instead of right click reporting, let the community self-moderate. If you act like a dick, you won't make friends, you won't be able to get runs or play the game properly.
---
Fun talking to you, and I wish you well.
---
Don't mind me. I need dis
---
I specifically remember taking people to get attuned for MC doing BRD lava runs. We would sell the attunement I think. It was a long time ago.
---
Thats wrong. I played Warrior in the Beta, in Vanilla and on Nost and Ely and Warrior is BY FAR the hardest class to level. You'd think with my 15 Years of Experience it would be a breeze but I still die a shit ton because Warrior sucks ass before 40. 
---
They heavily over-gear MC, a normal guild in pre-raid BiS will blast through MC within a 2 hour raid night if they are some previous experience and voice com's.  These cutting edge guilds will run 2 groups of 30 through MC to make gearing more efficient.  A raid roster usually comprises of 50ish core players, and they will split these into smaller groups that dont clear as fast but they get twice as many drops per week.
---
In a lot of cases where pserv's are using "best guess values" they are actually over-tuning the boss encounters.  Pserv's want people to enjoy experiencing the content and prolong the life of the server, they aren't just blatantly under-tuning bosses because they don't know an actual armor value...
---
Didn’t they say summer? The 29th is in fall. 
---
As a casual with an uncertain schedule, I'm cool with leveling two toons at a time without expecting to raid right away.
---
I'm thinking my secondary mage will be able to provide food and drink for my friends and my main while leveling.
---
Yeah I’ve actually been practicing questing routes and trying to be efficient as possible, gotta stay ahead of the pack and I want to be miles ahead. 
---
Sorry to semi-hijack, but I’ve been looking everywhere for potential BIS lists for warlock pvp.
---
Anyone got any resources they could share?
---
&gt;  choose whatever spec I want, and still be able to be invited into raids and not be pigeonholed into a role I don't want.
---
But you already can do this.  You just won't be invited to raid with people who are serious about progression unless you're in an optimal spec.
---
You already have the freedom to play how you want.  Your problem boils down to others choosing to min-max which may exclude you.
---
Ah yes! Like the blacklists of old. I'm down for it.
---
And I wish you well too! 
---
I request that when people make new PVP montages that they use music from the era. Really give that authentic feel!
---
I'll enjoy having a funded, well-geared rogue this time rather than struggling through leveling mostly in whites up to level 30. It's going to be therapeutic.
---
It is still impressive. If it were my guild from vanilla then we would have struggled at just the splitting in to 2 groups part, with a bunch ending up following the wrong group!
---
No one has made those claims, so I can't possibly predict what is next in your imaginary world.
---
haha, they absolutely are! As a Tauren, the forsaken quests that involved poisoning prisoners were kind of tough to do.
---
Hell yea, my dude.
---
Last year my friend and I did ALL of the Mulgore quests.
---
Never gave much attention to the Tauren start zone before and really was able to sink into it. I thought mostly empty land and questing alongside the edge of the zone would be boring but I absolutely loved it.
---
I played a druid. I could main tank raids, do really good dps as cat or moonkin, or heal as a tree. None of the specs were suboptimal for raids.
---
But.. That dude is in Stormwind? So it doesn't matter!
---
HoJ his hordescum ass 
---
Although I’m a lock main, usually mage has an easier time with fights that warlock can’t win a lot easier. Mage having the higher skill ceiling means there’s a bit more flexibility to mobility and kiting. The classes them selves are balanced enough so that both are extraordinarily strong.
---
I'll never understand it. You have a choice between boring humans and Lord of the Rings: Or badass monsters.
---
But then again, we were punks/metal heads in high school so it only seemed an obvious choice.
---
...except for the one of us that went human. Fucking Graham.
---
All the best Paladin healing gear comes from outside raids. Our sanc Paladin was always competitive in raids and didn’t have the 5% crit. 
---
I raided MC &amp; BWL multiple times after forgetting to respec from my pvp spec and would still crush meters. 
---
I’ll agree that for progression in AQ and Naxx sure, min maxing is important but the content is all so easy it really doesn’t matter. Competing on the meters is easy and winning meters has nothing to do with who the best or most efficient healer is. Those paladins outdoing you on the meters isn’t because they have more crit, it’s because they know how to smug the meters. 
---
A Paladin in preraid BIS should not go close to OOM in literally any raid 
---
You are in the distinct minority with that opinion
---
I have Blues but won't recommend them to anyone who doesn't have an Audiophile level mic setup. Extremely loud on discord, your stream, to your roommates, etc.
---
I concur my guild in retail took nearly a year to clear MC for the first time.  My raiding career in retail was hardly something to be proud of and it was only when AQ20/40 came out that we had a really consistent solid 40 man team.  Back then we wasted as much time attuning and gearing new players as we did running raids, guild stability was not very good at all, but that was maybe our very "casual but competent" attitude made more serious players want to leave for better progress rates.  
---
I personally have tried this power gaming style for a short while and it was fun and challenging and demanding, but what it wasnt was relaxing.  I can understand the buzz of being at the cutting edge, but I have not got the time or motivation to do it any longer.  I am much happier chilling in a raid and working with a guild of people I like hanging out with
---
when it comes to pvp, mage + priest combo is straight up ridiculous. I've broken 10 man blitzkriegs with a mage friend and have rushed the alliance base graveyard in AB just so we could keep 'em from getting reinforcements early in the match, successfully most of the time. it's just amazing what you can do with that amount of CC.
---
however, you have kinda mixed up the races there. trolls tend to be *better* priests than UD (at least when it comes to shadow), thanks to their absolutely overpowered racial spells, while shamans... yeah, don't go with trolls there. orcs are regarded as the best race for shamans, and for a good reason - that stun resistance is OP as fuck.

Here is my opinion. The small vocal community that wants TBC repeats themselves every day and TBC was garbage for everything but raiding, which is why the best scripted private server ever with it's vaunted spell batching is FAILING to hold an endgame population atm. Want to play TBC? Go play it so you can all realize how bad TBC is. It sucks past the VANILLA leveling process. Have fun getting people to do nerfed, known raids, when all TBC has is raiding. The people claiming it had great balance are delusional and obviously never got out of Kara or never engaged in high end arena where only a few comps dominated. **Entire classes weren't brought to Sunwell** like Mages and they had no offspec to get that raid spot. It wasn't uncommon to have them sit outside raids and hand people food/water just to earn brownie points DKP so they could be brought in when the content was on farm.
---
**Arena also took away class freedom and forced you into specs. You had no flexibility. You spent money to respec from a spec you often hated in PvP to a spec you often hated in PVE.** Do you think all rogues wanted to throw away their daggers and be the stupid shadowstep hemo spec with imp poisons that no longer had burst? It's the most boring rogue spec in history with none of the carrots on the stick to keep you playing. Do you think all mages wanted to be frost instead of elemental or fire or pom /blastwave? All because arena made all other pvp pointless?
---
Let me sum up most of these TBC posts. Hi, I ruined the modern game but refuse to play ti so I want to ruin Classic WoW to. TBC was great even though I never did anything in it and raided Kara all expansion. I got to press lightning bolt and a dumb totem macro though so it was AWESOME, even though elemental shamans sucked compared to Vanilla, because resilience and lack of burst made the class crap without CC. I am going to pimp TBC every single day on this forum and never shut up about it.
---
The problem is, what can be done about it? The slippery slope is very real, and while I personally wouldn’t mind class balance tweaks in a vacuum, I’m afraid that it will lead to more tweaks which eventually changes the game into something totally different. If classes can be tweaked, why not encounters? And drop rates? And xp rates? Eventually this will lead to addition of brand new content and so become a totally different game, one that I (and others)may or may not like. 
---
This is the main fear, and this kind of thing happens in all aspects of life all the time, and this kind of thing can generally only be prevented by having a strong constitution that places an absolute limit on what may or may not be done. In this case, that limit is whether or not the feature existed between 1.1 and 1.12, and it’s probably as clear a constitution as you’re going to get for a project such as this.
---
That mage dual wielding sword and wand like a boss.
---
Irrelevant, people don’t need even the thought of associating the addon and classic.
---
Why should i listen to this man, just because he writes walls after walls? Open pandora's box once and no one knows for sure what happens.
---
There aren't progressive changes in private servers and this has nothing to do with some slight differences between vanilla and private servers. 
---
I personally don't want anything else after what it was in 1.12. But i guess, i can go @#$# myself? People and their "opinions" need to realize that for each opinion there is another and neither is better. Who should blizzard listen. So yea, for someone like me, he's literally putting words in my mouth.

Even in PvP do you think troll priests are better than undead? WOTF and the extra dot from undead seems better for shadow than what trolls have to offer.  Am I wrong on that? If so please let me know lol. 
---
Troll I prefer just for aesthetics and having played an undead on retail for years. 
---
yea it's great but we don't need the front page flooded with it.
---
Alternatively it's only if you intend on rushing to raiding that leveling an alt first is a problem. If you like leveling, it's great. You get the experience of rough-necking it to 60 and then you get to enjoy the journey in comfort the second time.
---
Yea ofcourse you can make more people to enjoy the game, but it's not the game i want. SO where do we draw the line, or i can go suck it? Which includes more people than me. It sounds like "how to make blizz more money" that making a game that is targeted to a given percentage of people and everyone else either likes it or don't.  "SLIGHTLY" i just love that word, in a RPG where each class fills a niche in leveling, soloing, PVP, PVE. That slightly combined with the fact that current blizz has absolutely no one from the old team left, surely sounds like it won't backfire.

Also flurry axe. Troll area in hinterlands while in a party. Won the roll and sold on AH for what was probably a steal since in sold in less than an hour.

LOL what? Do you mean all the best pre raid gear is outside raids? You literally can't get a single piece of healing BiS gear outside of raiding. There is no situation that isn't improved by 5% crit. In vanilla you would trade over 20 int for 1% crit. It is that good and crit percentages were few and far between on gear.
---
How do you know he didn't take the crit? Sanc is the 21 talent. Why the fuck would he not go 30 holy? There is no place to put those 5 points that will be even 10% as impactful.
---
You sound like you're talking about private servers and farm content. Maybe it's a difference of opinion, but a good healer (or better yet, good raider) will always perform the maximum output they can. That's called doing your part of a group. Teamwork. The backbone of Vanilla.
---
You seem to think everyone doing BWL will already be in full epics. Do you not understand what progressive content is? There are still wipes. There are still fights where 12 dps and 2 healers die and you NEED that mana and extra healing.
---
Pull your weight or get cut from decent guilds. Maybe you will get lucky, slide under the radar and get carried. I just hope you understand that. You are being carried. You are a drain on your raid. You are literally arguing that you don't need to be bringing your best for your guildmates.

Progression wise during vanilla I only got to BWL on my priest. Can't wait for classic to relive and reexplore such an incredible game!

That's true. It wasn't something that was hard coded. They could dial it up and down however they wanted. They just chose not to dial it up too far because of social ingame aspects.

This was it for me. I've been a WC fan since the first one, and while I know that the real story arc is against the burning legion, when Arthas kicked the bucket it felt like closure for me.

This isn't true.

I don't know what server you played on but this has not been a thing on any of the private servers for at least as long as I've played ( a year ). 
---
&gt; broken mechanics(like Nef class call being able to right click off)
---
Okay cool, a bug which affects one fight which was fixed. This isn't even a fight used to measure DPS capability anyway.
---
&gt; THE FACT THAT YOU CAN GO TO EVERY RAID WITH FULL FLASKS ON EVERY RAID MEMBER!!! 
---
I raided with Death and Taxes for 3 years. We did this. So did a lot of other guilds. On a 3k pop server it's absolutely possible to always have these available on progression nights for a heavily active guild. Plus goose, jujus, etc. across the board.
---
&gt; getting a flask was impossible outside of guild banks funneling money to tanks.
---
Only if you were bad.
---
&gt; all the melle in private servers were STACKED with flasks, same with casters.
---
This happened in OG vanilla too, as I've already stated. The only time availability would have been an issue is if you were personally trying to craft all of your own consumables and had to compete directly for herb spawns. That said, competition is far heavier for herbs on pservers than it ever was in vanilla. In Vanilla you could go to any zone at 3 am and be one of only a handful of people, even on the highest population servers. It will likely be this way again in Classic because pservers suffer from huge international populations and if you think the dynamic spawns make herbing easier than it was in vanilla you're either being willfully ignorant or you're willing to lie to make a point.
---
&gt; full world buffs, which was also 100000x easier to get in private servers
---
What? Full suites of world buffs are available to every guild every week. You're smoking crack if you think entire guilds are just sitting around Orgrimmar waiting for another random guild to turn in an Ony head.
---
&gt; broken proc rates on broken items like ironfoe  
---
This is another niche, non-factor example. The list doesn't go "on and on". The majority of thing's you've mentioned are either objectively wrong, irrelevant, or not actually applicable to private servers as they currently exist and have no bearing on this entire conversation.
---
For the Horde! 
---
-recent convert
---
&gt;Which of these two preform better in wpvp?
---
I would say their are about similar, but warlocks will often be low HP while lvling due to lifetapping, so if you are getting jumped you are pretty likely to die. So always have a oulstone up.
---
Warlock PvP also improves tremendously when they get death coil, but thats at like 44 or something.
---
&gt;Which one has an easier time getting to a pug raid?
---
Mage, warlocks have no viable build with threat reduction, so they are mostly added to groups for their utility. Usually not more than 3, while mages you can stack a lot more due to having like 20% lower threat.
---
But if you are just pugging ZG for entire duration of vanilla, then it doesn't really matter that much. Either is fine.
---
Sick edit btw
---
"that being said" andy
---
But alliance warlocks will have an advantage in PvE due to pally threat reduction buff, while on horde they would have to have a dedicated shaman in group which is never a priority.
---
Were they added in the wotlk pre patch? I just remember dual wielding gladiator swords for a while.

meh, I can't stand that BC introduced immortal healers. It also started giving other classes shit, like giving a stun to warlock. I agree that overall damage in raids were fine between pure dps and hybrids, with pure dps being higher. The pvp side of things I really started not to like. While I feel BC gameplay wise was ok it was the start of the game going downhill. BC lore/story was horrendous though and I will never forgive it for that, but to be fair every single expansion has been a letdown lore storyside.
---
You're literally arguing on the basis of your opinion while stating opinions are invalid. He didn't give opinion. He outlines *EXTREMELY* well that 1.12.1 the entirety of Vanilla is not blizzlike. The difference between the launch of a private server and actual 1.1 was not *slight* and it is not an opinion.
---
You should listen because Vanilla is not a private server. It should never be static because it wasn't. No changes is the biggest change to Vanilla. Balance changed monthly. That's Vanilla. Since you said nothing else after 1.12 I can also assume you didn't play literal Vanilla. You would know that talents were pruned and overhauled throughout the patches and they could introduce the older talents to make the poor specs better. That would still be Vanilla. I would love to hear your reason why that is not
---
&gt; If I look stupid as a new model, I will feel compelled to toggle it on and off to make sure it looks fine on both.
---
This just sounds like simple paranoia, to me.
---
Man focus is pvp with pve raiding for the gear. Will be alliance 
---
Mage
---
+. Cc, high dps, aoe farm, great solo pvp and appears to be good in bgs(I haven't played but I've heard but I've also not seen a single premade looking for a mage specifically), easy tailoring gear whilst leveling 
---
-. Squishy, 3 counters being hunter warlock and shammy.
---
Warlock
---
+ tanky, respectably high dps, great solo and group pvp, wide array of tools for everything, free mount, easy tailoring gear, easy leveling 
---
-. Wotf, no mobility, fight or die, coil has a long cool down,
---
I'm leaning towards mage due to the mobility in pvp and instant damage for group pvp, cc too. However not played one on private servers and have played a warlock to 30, which I've really enjoyed so far. World pvp has been fun and I can only recall one fight that I lost which I would of won as a mage.
---
What would you guys recommend?
---
Back story, played from wrath to bfa. Played priest whole time as shadow with a bit in healer. Dabbled a bit in lok. Never touched mage. Just know mage is great in pvp at this stage of wow. 
---
Hunter pets can just molest you in the water anyhow.
---
I would say "Lok'tar Ogar!"
---
If that doesn't work, crippling poison, rupture and kite
---
^
---
Good luck
---
And I know, no changes and all.... but damn I sure hate it that I earned it and now the game is re-releasing classic and I can't use it... Lamentations
---
What can I say I'm a people person. Everyone bitches and cries about art posts or theorycrafting posts so it's like cool lets just get posts talking about how excited we are for the game. 
---
I felt it was a little harsh so I just gave you a sarcastic one instead.
---
I think raiding still holds up, not because all of the encounters are necessarily difficult, but the experience of progression with 40 fucking people is always awesome, even if some bosses are a stomp.
---
I still think BWL and even stupid Onyxia (people still don't know how to manage threat, trust me) has an okay difficulity, and will require guilds to progress unless are completely made up of pserver veterans who has been farming them for years.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure talents were always updated in the prepatch. You would have had a little under a month to play around, but I consider prepatches to be the next expansion.
---
Two voidwalker shields were also "implied" lmao people are butthurt over numbers 
---
Yeah, hes been talking about enhance shaman updates before BFA released. If I was trapped in a room with Todd Howard, Ion and Peter Molyneux and they kept saying everything was going to be ok, I would 100% know I was fucked and about to die.
---
for shadow? yes. 
---
shadowguard applies shadow weaving and can proc blackout - there are few better feelings than a sneaky rogue attacking you and going *splat*, getting instantly stunned with a nice chuck of damage as an extra.
---
hex of weakness is also a menace, it's like having a mini pocket warrior - 20% healing debuff might not sound like much, but it is ranged, cheap, spammable, and can absolutely mess up any healer's plan. it's also a curse, so only druids and mages can dispel it... and they won't.
---
berserking, while not the greatest racial, can lead to some rather fun shenanigans. 2.1 sec mind control cast? don't mind if I do. it's also one of the best "oh shit" buttons in PvE healing.
---
UD do have an edge in PvP healing, where WotF can easily save their asses, but otherwise... nah. devouring plague is an easily dispellable mana-hog (paladins will actually remove it *by accident*) and their other spell is a shittier hex.
---
tl;dr: the troll master races welcomes you.
---
As much as I'd like to see some tweaks to Rets for PvE, I am absolutely terrified of what any buffs would do to them in PvP. They are already monsters in the right hands. 
---
A BiS for PvP is difficult as a lot depends on the encounter and your personal gameplay.  
---
However I do have a list of usefull items that I also have listed in the pvp faq section of the [classic warlock discord](https://discord.gg/3fvUDqF)  
---
I would paste it here but its a pain to format.
---
##  
---
Mine was a blood razor 1 handed sword and it dropped off the dogs near the entrance of BRD. I won the roll and used it on my 49 twink rogue!
---
&gt; The relative simplicity of priests speaks to me.
---
priests are one of the most complex classes with a high as fuck skill ceiling. while you don't have over a dozen totems, what you do have are ridiculous utility spells. dispel makes the enemy cry, mind control can do some utterly horrific shit, mind vision can pinpoint the enemy fc, the list goes on and on.
---
if you want simply, go with paladin.
---
But why... the map itself has less details then a chocolate biscuit.
---
The Division 2 releases at midnight tonight, it's a looter shooter with dungeons and raids, should help scratch that itch for a few months
---
&gt;Lock looks appealing but I heard they are squishier than a half-filled air mattress till atleast fully decked in tier 1/2
---
Yes, because the best PvE gear is the gear spell power on it. The tier gear has a massive amount of stam and weird stats like hp/per 5 If I remember correctly. But you can still do soul-link PvP, grab that tier 2 gear that no locks wants and go be a fucking tank in PvP.
---
Glass cannon has always been the way to go for PvE, warriors will be using leather as well for that reason.
---
&gt;Priest looks really cool but I’ve been told shadow pvp kind of sucks.
---
Shadow priest is one of the best speccs for PvP, amazing utility, heal, mind-controlling shitters out of BGs/ off booty bay boat. They are also quite tanky vs melee (I think shadow form reduces melee damage taken, can't remember). They have a fucking silence, dots. They are definitely strong in PvP.
---
Shadow priests melt faces in pvp
---
I think you and I are the only people to comment about it... At least that I've seen it did make me plenty of gold as well 
---
No you definitely don't get it if the words "merge servers" came out of your mouth. There is no merging. There is no separate servers. Just sharding with a choice and no phasing.
---
depends if you are skilled enough to one-shot someone with a WF proc.
---
a skilled shaman can one-shot pretty much anything besides plate armor, and for that they have frostshock.
---
Melt his face in pvp ofc
---
Take your head out of your ass for once and get some fresh air bud. 
---
I'm not sure what youre asking...
---
I was never so surprised in my life, even though I was probably 18 at the time, still knocked my socks off!
---
How does that excuse the need of balancing in classic? What does classic means? Ofcourse there were constant changes, so what? For what there wasn't time, it made its way in TBC and so one. So please define classic if we start changing things just because it was changed constantly in vanilla?
---
I don't get this logic seriously, the word classic exists for everything, from games, to movies and music. Many things evolved for better or worse over time. That's why its called classic and the moment it hits TBC, its over. It should be statci because it's time passed long long time ago. To say it simply, i don't want anything changed post 1.12. Im WELL aware how the game progressed back then, and im aware that the very fact we start from 1.12 is already a change, but in what world does that mean that paladins should suddenly rival warriors in DPS? Just because "it might have eventually happened back then". So i ask you, how is classic, classic, when you apply that logic and start changing it just because it would have changed if not for TBC and so on?
---
No i don't want changes, so do people like me and i just bend over?
---
My favourite bg is arathi basin by far.
---
Was mainly just looking for a good list to aim for for different specs. 
---
Unsure how to balance t3+pvp gear for example.
---
Skull of impending doom vs spellstone? 
---
Tidal charm vs other trinkets etc.
---
Will ask discord too :) thanks 
---
Shadow sucks in pvp? Whoever told you that has the mental capacity of a baked onion.
---
You wont be able to see the number.  I think there were addons that estimated it.
---
Thanks for the input!
---
Not unless if you have 2 accounts or a middleman you can't. You cannot send crafted food in the mail or be logged on 2 characters at once. 
---
My brains foggy, I mained a prot warrior i just remember going fury just to play with titans grip. It's been a few years!
---
Looking at all those signatures I immediately saw Pat Nagle. Suddenly it hit me...
---
That is a beautiful, and practical, resource.
---
(Can you put the subway from IF to Stormwind somehow?)
---
you're a fucking wrecking ball, with more utility than probably any other class. you can mess with your enemies in ways you couldn't possibly have imagined. downside? you're the primary target for anyone worth their salt and an extremely fragile one at that.
---
if that sounds appealing to you, go for it. personally, I think playing  a priest is probably the most fun you can have with your clothes on.
---
Good to know
---
Shamans couldn't learn dual wield in vanilla if I remember correctly. Only 1H + shield/offhand or 2H
---
Yes.  Use 1.12 as a base, make balance updates every few months.
---
Tailoring I definitely agree with, and suggest switching to it later. What value do you think enchanting adds? I figure engineering adds a lot more personal value whereas enchanting you can benefit from other people taking it on.
---
When you’ve already written too many long ass hyped replies and this is all you can say now
---
Shamans couldn't dual wield in vanilla. That only came in TBC. So as enh you will be using 2h. Getting a raid spot as enh will be difficult but not impossible. I doubt you'll get into any hardcore guilds though. Which might be an issue bc sham gear really takes off in AQ.
---
On a side note though ele is considered superior pvp wise. So you might want to look into that as well. Not saying enh is bad. Ele is just more consistent.
---
Why leave free skins laying around though? Thats money on the ground.
---
?????
---
Warriors and Paladins
---
Elemental mage was a very known and commonly used mage spec in vanilla, just fyi.
---
Titan's grip was probably my favorite talent to ever be added. I'm with you on the love for it. I had to look up the prepatch info to be sure, it's definitely been a few years. I just remember being hype as shit to dual wield Armageddons and show off how strong my char was in Wrath lol. It was shiny and new
---
Agree on the resources. thanks to /u/vibiusr on some notes – I'm going to give it another update tomorrow night.
---
Never had one :(
---
&gt;LOL what? Do you mean all the best pre raid gear is outside raids? 
---
?? Helm, neck, shoulders, cape, wrists and belt(crafted with MC mats tho) are all BIS items till Naxx and come from outside raids. 
---
&gt;How do you know he didn't take the crit? Sanc is the 21 talent. Why the fuck would he not go 30 holy? 
---
You're asking how I knew the spec of one of my guildmates, who played the same class as me? Lol do you not talk to your guildmates? and he didn't go 30 holy because he PVP'd a lot and didn't want to have to respec twice a week. 
---
&gt;There is no place to put those 5 points that will be even 10% as impactful.
---
Depends what you're trying to get out of that spec my dude. 5% crit is almost useless when you're pvping compared to most other talents you can get. 
---
&gt;You sound like you're talking about private servers and farm content.
---
If you think vanilla raids won't be a cakewalk in class you're going to be mistaken. The mechanics are too easy. Give the bosses bonus armor and HP and they're STILL a cakewalk. 
---
&gt;Maybe it's a difference of opinion, but a good healer (or better yet, good raider) will always perform the maximum output they can. That's called doing your part of a group. Teamwork. The backbone of Vanilla.
---
Yeah you could ask anyone in my guild about me, I was extremely valued as a healer &amp; LC'd VERY good items because of that.
---
&gt;You seem to think everyone doing BWL will already be in full epics. Do you not understand what progressive content is? There are still wipes. There are still fights where 12 dps and 2 healers die and you NEED that mana and extra healing.
---
Again specifically to Paladin the gear from preraids is insane and better than most stuff in the raids. You don't NEED that mana if you're any good at all. If you're running OOM even on fuckups you're doing something wrong or your guild needs way better DPS. If your paladins run out of mana something else is going terribly wrong. 
---
&gt;Pull your weight or get cut from decent guilds. Maybe you will get lucky, slide under the radar and get carried. I just hope you understand that. You are being carried. You are a drain on your raid. You are literally arguing that you don't need to be bringing your best for your guildmates.
---
Yeah except I didn't get cut from guilds and constantly make raid rosters and get top healer gear LC'd to me because I'm such a drag on all my raids. 
---
Good job maximizing your spec, I'll still beat you on the meters. 
---
My staff of westfall lasted until 40 
---
If you're skilled enough you're gonna WF crit 1shot anything you encounter. But only if you're skilled enough. Be skilled
---
Yeah, but I don't know if it was confirmed, it's heavily rumored that gnomes were added super late in development.
---
Like, the gnome in the EK loading screen was just a model superpositioned on the art, lol
---
I literally can't wait, my body is going to combust.
---
Whilst we're on warriors...
---
What's the take on me going prot at 60 to farm dungeons but rolling on dps gear as I want to raid as fury? Is this cool or do people get upset about it?
---
Thanks :)
---
Krol blade off a wolf in felwood. Helped me get my epic mount
---
Everyone in this sub is also rank 14.. Not sure what this post is about
---
Would be nice if the guide had a section on juggling multiple mobs. The most effective way to level a warlock is to have voidwalker tank one mob while another is kept feared. Both fully DoT'd up and then wanded to death. Once one mob dies immediately pull another, only briefly resting when necessary to allow voidwalker to consume shadows back to full health while the warlock bandages or eat/drinks.
---
Voidwalker's mana will last far longer if torment is manually used a limited number of times each mob since this will give it a lot more time outside the five second rule to regen. This isn't really viable when solo killing mobs since your voidwalker needs all the threat it can get, but works great when juggling mobs.
---
Warlock rotation is really dynamic due to the large gaps in power between ranks. There are 10 levels between each rank of curse of agony, immolate, and corruption but they all comes at different levels. That makes rigidly following any one rotation suboptimal.
---
There is a straight up list with items in the **#pvp faq** channel if you use the pins you will see a title called **gear, trinket and consumes**. That is the one you want :)
---
You could just not invite anyone else who uses plate, so it wouldn't even come up
---
Why would you have to rename your char?
---
Whatever I say you will change you mind on your main another 3 times between now and launch, and possibly when your pally gets to level 30 and you are bored of 2 mobs per minute :D
---
&gt;Warlocks are one of the best all-around classes, but I suspect after over a decade, the secrets out, and the class won't be the least played by a mile.
---
Yeah, that's kind of what I'm afraid of. I'm probably leaning towards priest or warrior the most. I'd really like a healing or tanking role.
---
hardcore guilds and non-hardcore guilds have the same chance to get Hand of Ragnaros.
---
The way i look at it is: 
---
Horde has best access to leveling dungeons like you listed.
---
Alliance has best access to some endgame dungeon and raids that are a huge bitch for horde players;
---
\-BRD, BWL, UBRS, LBRS are all in blackrock which is smack between two alliance capitals. From what i understand, this resulted in horde having their actual hearthstone in that city in bastedlands for easy access and just got mage portals to actually go anywhere else.
---
scholo and strath and others are closer to undercity, but on the alliance's continent and alliance can get their just fine all things considered. Nothing compared to being so bad it warranted a hearthstone link.
---
They have to find/see you first.
---
*Underwater Breathing Intensifies*
---
Yeah and you know your character is just temporary on ps, take that weight away and boosh, it's even MORE magic when we finally log in!
---
Where are you getting multiple servers from? What about Sargeras 1 2 and 3 makes you think there would be naming conflicts? It's the same fucking server, but sharded 3 ways. What about regular sharding? What if I complained about renaming in regards to normal sharding? You must feel stupid now :(
---
&gt; Getting that is more rewarding than ANY epic in retail
---
God, it's so true. Jintha'alor felt so intimidating once. Finally making it all the way to the top almost felt like it came with bragging rights. It was intense. Now I'm pretty sure I could make it to max level without dying once. That's just sad.
---
My paladin friend is very very unlikely to play much. He hated vanilla and love BC, so he's only making a character because I basically begged him lol.
---
That's okay. I plan on forming my own guild, so whatever raid spot I want will be mine. 
---
you're still being put into a separate community each time you swap servers, and it doesn't alleviate spawn-area crowding at all.
---
Exactly the same as regular sharding dude.
---
When does the album drop, am already going to Download Fest, hating the idea classic might come out during then! But I had no idea they had one coming, I like Tool but bought the ticket for Slipknot
---
Because classic was 12 major content patches that balanced the game. The way I see it, the #nochangers are the private server babies that think they understand Vanilla after theory crafting for 10 years on an incomplete, poor imitation. The people who at least try to find compromise in balance and tweaking are the ones who actually played Vanilla. They are the ones that understand Vanilla was a constant cycle of balancing and retweaking. Recreating that experience and environment would entail some tweaking. Simple, no?
---
Classic was no flying, no name changing, no teleporting to dungeons, original classes, original content, original pvp and server community. It was NOT "this number is this" "this spec is this" "this ability is this". You are too caught up in the actual specifics and are trying to recreate a feeling and journey with empirical data. It doesn't fucking work that way mate.
---
Not saying change all talents to TBC. That doesn't mean in the quest for balance that is the spirit of what Vanilla did, we can't take inspiration from some of their solutions. Want to fix pally mana? Give the talent that gave them mana when healed by another player deep in the prot tree. Too deep to be abused by a holy paladin without sacrificing more important utility.
---
I'm not getting any deeper into this. You're being reidiculous. Even if the above is unacceptable, Blessing of Kings used to be the 31 ret talent. That made ret paladins instantly more viable. Warriors sucked ass. They should suck ass in early stages. It's not Vanilla to keep the EXACT power dynamic. So either progress talents and spell tweaks exactly the same as the original release schedule or accept alternatives that are fair and do not detract from the Vanilla experience.
---
I've outlines this clearly enough. If you don't want changes you don't want Vanilla. The games changed.
---
So as others have said, in classic enh can’t dual wield. So it’s all 2handers and 1h+shield. In terms of bad matchups - anything that can kite you, which is a lot of classes. Hunters and mages come to mind specifically. Your best matchup is probably a feral druid or a warrior that isn’t OP geared (not a great compliment lol). 
---
Conversely, ele shamans are fuego in pvp. It’s almost too easy. You have on demand burst like no one else (lightning bolt is a 2 sec cast and chain lightning is a 1.5 sec cast with talents. If they crit they do crazy dmg, and if you cast them in that order they hit at about the same time because lightning bolt has a travel time and chain lightning doesn’t. Plus you can have natures swiftness for instant casting either of those spells, plus the shocks which can also do a bunch of dmg) and you’re in mail with a shield and can heal, plus you have all these great totems. Basically you can kinda just choose when certain opponents die. It’s unbelievably powerful. But make sure you bring some water ;)
---
I have an enh shaman on a pserver with the best 2h made (Might of Menethil) and a bunch of random raid gear buffing mostly weapon damage versus intellect or spell power.  So very well geared. 
---
1v1 PVP is verrrrrrrry different than in groups.  In groups, people will see you and focus you because you are a big threat otherwise and also have poor escape abilities.  So you have to play pretty careful and not just charge in like a warrior or Ret paladin might. 
---
You get destroyed by rogues, even with PVP trinket.  Too many ways for them to CC you that you can't stop, and the damage is way too high.  Evasion greatly nerfs any damage you can do to them as well.  You'll never beat a good rogue if they get the opener on you and have cooldowns available- but you can keep them at bay by kiting, flame shock to prevent stealth, etc. 
---
Warriors wreck you (probably) but sometimes if you get a good WF you will be able to out-burst them.  You can't heal yourself with the MS debuff on it's pointless.  They will do much more damage to you while you are trying to cast than you will actually heal. 
---
You wreck paladins.  Nuff said.  Keep yourself over 70-80% hp to avoid reck bombs and you will just outdamage them consistently.  Earth shock really gimps their ability to do anything, and grounding totem eats HOJ or judgments, or hammer of wrath if you're in a bad spot =P  Make sure to purge BOP as well if they try to use it on themselves. 
---
You can mostly wreck any caster unless you play poorly and assuming equal gear.  Again, grounding totem and earth shock are both pretty low cooldowns that are amazingly effective and you also have tremor totem as a big boost against locks and priests.  Purge their buffs too!
---
Druids is kind of a stalemate, you can purge their hots and bufffs but they can kite you for 8 years and still heal themselves or restealth. 
---
Yes, DW got added with TBC.
---
If you earned Grand Marshal in vanilla and still have that character you should have that title available to that character in retail. 
---
Call him a no lifer whilst dying inside from envy 
---
Priest is definitely sounds like what you are looking for. Great healer for PvE, basically a shoe in. While Shadow is a monster in PvP.
---
Ret can put out great burst in PvP but for Priest you can have damage on demand, rather than proc-based. Pally is a great PvE healer as well, so also a shoe in.
---
Lock won't be covering your PvE healing criteria, but since you've included it as an area of interest then I would say that puts another point towards Priest over Pally.
---
It'll be okay buddy I wish you luck this time around! 
---
&gt;I dont know if you need to speak to do old raid
---
True, but also part of the problem was 15 years ago you had to get people to download ventrilo or TeamSpeak.  Then you had to give them server info.  Trying to get any number of randoms who weren't aware what this was, was difficult.
---
Now if you DID want to require/use voice chat for some reason; you could just use the integrated [B.Net](https://B.Net) social tab along with the integrated voice if you so wished.  So getting PUGS to coordinate or use voice chat will be immensely easier now considering everyone will have BNET installed from the get-go.
---
I'm having similar issues. I really want to re-experience the night elf starting area, but I'm unsure of what to play. I love rogues and the ability to stealth and the whole fantasy around that, but I have a feeling it's gonna be more difficult to make friends and find strangers to play with this time around. Priest could be a good bet, but I vehemently dislike star shards. I don't like pet classes, and I'm not sold on druid. So my only option is warrior. But I'm not sure if I'm going to like it, mainly because stance dancing doesn't appeal to me. :/
---
Congratulations... You played ya self
---
While these events will certainly gather much higher population than your average night, it is nothing compared to 7 million people all trying to make a starting character.
---
Regardless of whether they implement it or not, Classic is being built on an engin that contains shading.
---
I'd much rather have Valley of trials shared, or even instanced, over finding out that my server population is screwed because too many sightseers came in at launch and now it's a ghost town.
---
Pop an Orb of Deception and confuse him with broken, shitty Alliance-Orcish.
---
I got Anthem on Wednesday and I played it for 10 straight hours 
---
I haven’t bought an online sub for consoles since 2010 and this game has far exceeded my expectations 
---
You also don't get blamed like the MT either. It's great.
---
meh TBC dungeon "finder" and summoning stones were pretty f'ing nice.
---
you might be able to get an idea of how long it took your hunter using this website:
---
http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charhistory.php
---
It took me about 4 months according to this lol 
---
The game is insanely amazing. Litteraly so much depth to it and every new character or experience is a different journey. Even you level the same class and raid through everything twice on new fresh servers it is a new journey. That's why so many people start again and again on pservers after clearing everything.
---
When I watch my favorite movie I appreciate new things every time and I enjoy it more each time because the experience builds upon itself. The first time is special of course, but only because it was the introduction to something great. I think WoW Classic will be the same way.
---
Yeah i've seen them and after doing more research and talking to some people it will be most likely i'll pick it, ty :)
---
The memories are the best part of it, I can still remember  what it felt like see the purple text in the loot box man did it feel amazing. 
---
Lmao dat WF crit 
---
Guess you didn't read the thread then sweetie. The top comment is advocating for sharding to last a month. 
---
Not by default but there will be addons that estimate it
---
All the current QQ about ferals being viable are based on private server testing, not Vanilla.  Search on Youtube for druid tanks and look for videos that are 12 years old.  See how many you find.
---
Oh wow I didn't know about Bad Religion album thanks!
---
There's no simple answers though. A lot of hybrids are strong in Vanilla PvP, while being extremely far behind in PvE. How would you propose buffing Ele shamans for example into raid viability, without breaking them completely for BGs? Or ret paladins? Some of these specs have like 50% less DPS than the rest, they would need absolutely massive buffs. 
---
Ret paladins in particular were a balance nightmare in TBC/Wrath. Paladins have so much survivability and utility built in to the class, that it's very tricky to give them reasonable DPS without creating unstoppable juggernauts. 
---
TBC pre-patch kinda did what you're suggesting, and it was crazy imbalanced. You pretty much need an expansion's worth of changes to make it all work.
---
Thanks for the write up brother 
---
thank you very much
---
Ahh. thank you 
---
The Lifestone and it stayed with my warlock through most of his days.
---
Attractive people irl want to try out being ‘unnattractive’. Unattractive people irl want to try out being pretty.
---
Horde = you’re attractive irl
---
I’m horde btw anyone hello boys look at me please
---
jk ugly and pretty doesn’t exist come on
---
says druids have bad output -&gt; points out that the absolute overwhelming majority of healing output records are by classes with far superior output -&gt; "you disproved your own argument"
---
???
---
did you not read the literal first thing i wrote earlier that says taking druids of any spec to a raid is a "bring the player, not the class" type deal?
---
I totally read the title in the voice of Yoda...
---
If you PvP, Engineering is top spec. If you don't, it gives Green Lens (not pre-bis but much more accessible than a helm of shadow power +41) and a few neat trinkets. I usually go Mining/Herbs and Engineering on every character.  
---
Tailoring gives Robes of Power (pre-bis) and a few other PvE things but isn't worth the investment.  
---
Enchanting is dogshit and probably only suggested because it 'combos' with tailoring to make the gold sink a little more tolerable.  
---
Tool and Classic WoW -  2019 is just awesome.
---
not sure, I think sometime later this year on the pc, and on steam!
---
Not only am I thankful for Nostalrius for getting us Classic, I am extremely happy that it proved their sorry asses wrong one by one.
---
Vanilla was shaped so that tight knit communities were formed. Time has absolutely nothing to do with it.
---
Nostalrius was one of the best gaming communities I've been part of.
---
Yeah, I found that. Obviously, they have completely revamped the rewards. Is there an heirloom version or something? I haven't played this game since WotLK. It's been a minute. 
---
Thanks for write-up. Such a tough choice man. Mage seems like the clear choice but seems so boring after playing it for so long
---
Think of it more like they are instancing Valley of Trials for the first weeks at launch, so the sightseers don't create problem populations right at launch.
---
They would in essence be making a demo instance for the initial spawn, but once you leave you get shot out onto the main server, which would have it's own Valley etc.
---
As fewer new toons are created, shrink the number of instances until you are down to zero, with sufficient capacity on the server.
---
LOL! WHO LET THE DAWGS OOUTT HOOO HOO!
---
tell me what resto druids do
---
heal? theyre shit output healers
---
abolish poison? shamans do it to an entire group at once and paladins abolish just as fast
---
decurse? each raid has like 8 mages
---
buff mark of the wild? far more beneficial-for-the-body-count feral druids can do that
---
Awesome! Keep up the good
---
That's not an add on, that's a part of retail now. He's showing a picture of one of his vanilla characters on a retail server.
---
I also have to hope the Halo PC ports don't come around the same time as Classic or I really will get zero sleep.
---
&gt;  *the fact* that those expacs represented the beginning of a slow deterioration

Sorry bud, elemental shamans are the PVP stars of vanilla, not enhance.  
---
Enh shaman is a fun class.. you can do AV to get Unstoppable force and you will be a competent PVPer.  PVE is not the same story- most groups won't take you as a pure DPS but you might be able to pull the "I'll heal on boss fights and DPS trash" type of thing.  Raids are basically a no-go completely!
---
But PVP is fun, don't get me wrong.  I'm kind of burned out on it because i was frustrated at constantly being owned by rogues and warriors and being focused a lot in group engagements, so I started focusing on a Ret instead that fit my preferred playstyle a bit more.  But the shaman was a monster- WF procs were huge!  Just got kind of boring relying on RNG to get kills or make an impact. 
---
If you enter combat as him can you still use the 2h?
---
I’m one of those OCD assholes who would rather have classic the way it was, no option. Almost everyone I know would rather have an option, though. I could have sworn I read someone saying it was confirmed (to my great dread). Not sure...
---
I'm not really sure what you're trying to accomplish, but if you want your gear to look like the Grand Marshal gear you can apply the appearance using the transmog system to any gear you're currently wearing.

If they just said "instance starting zones for the first month" I think no one would get their panties in a bunch. 
---
Most people take offence to them using the new tech. Using old tech to solve the problem would eliminate people's fear that it's built into the engine (even though it always will be).
---
Agree with all of this in a Vanilla context. However, I think Blizzard said somewhere that addons like Decursive will be getting the axe. Large-scale dispelling is going to get more difficult for everyone in Classic.
---
Dual wielding Shaman never felt right - but I think they had to do it to make sure that Shaman stood out from Paladins. It's the biggest downside of giving the classes to both factions. Ever since then, Enahncement has been a terribly designed spec that's either ridiculously overpowered (when you can burst people down) or total trash (when you can't) with no in-between.
---
But that's why we're playing Vanilla!
---
Resillience killed PvP for me. It literally ruined PvP for me, I quit the game more or less because of it. The talent trees were great in TBC though... 
---
I think you're asking if there is anything you can do in retail to give you an advantage in Classic regarding the PVP grind.  
---
No.  
---
Haha, ok man. You are right, launch of vanilla was smooth af. /s
---
"How do I reach these kids?" 
---
A simpler time. A better time.
---
I couldn't wait any longer either, I hopped on a Private Server but rolled a class I'd never usually play. 
---
I don't want to level past 20 though so I don't completely ruin the magic.
---
Anime is gay.
---
The good news for people who want things like this, is that if classic does as well as everyone thinks TBC might be right around the corner. I just don't want them to mess will Vanilla balance, and then TBC comes out and people who just want to play classic are stuck with an odd hybrid.
---
If you're playing without Stormstrike (i.e. Nature's Swiftness builds) then Taran Icebreaker is a great option. It's pretty bad when you add Stormstrike into the mix though.
---
My druid cried when [this beautiful hammer](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=29171) was just absorbed to the bear fur :,(
---
Thanks again, seems like I'm going to steer away from it 
---
Thing is tens of thousands of players will just cancel their subscription immediately if they choose to do this. I'd say the point when that happens is when they inevitably decide to shard STV or Searing Gorge. If they decide to keep permanent sharding in low level zones I'll immediately cancel my sub(s). I'm not putting up with this BS and I'm confident that tens if not hundreds of thousands of others will choose to cancel as well.
---
Strange how the sub is suddenly OK with sharding... 
---
*The* addon
---
BC had arguably better PvE, but a large part of the reason I raided was to crush in PvP. They ruined the vanilla rock paper scissors PvP "perfectly imbalanced" pvp that I loved and resillience made fights last an hour. Hated it. 
---
Every expansion had some bright spots, but the overall systems were best towards the end of vanilla. Changing everything in order to get it "perfect" is how we got retail.
---
I went to SFK quite often as alliance though 
---
Was it? Only one sentence mentioned up anyway which was about warlocks.
---
Y’all reaching 
---
Well say you have a character named freeze or something that would be fairly popular, if they merge servers there is a nearly 100% chance that name is taken on the second server, so what happens if they merge servers? Cant have 2 people named freeze
---
Sorry that you like to just ignore elements of how the world works that inconvenience you, but the slippery slope is not nonsense. Look at what happened to retail. It started as making hybrids competitive, and ended with total class homogenization because people thought it was “unfair” that only one class brought bloodlust, or a spell crit buff, or that not everyone had an interrupt, etc. To think that this time the same thing won’t happen once the floodgates are open to class changes is willful ignorance, bordering on bad faith.
---
Standing around waiting for mobs will force you to interact with other players and possibly group. Just like how it was in vanilla. The inconveniences of Vanilla force you to interact with others. That's the entire point.
---
Ass candy &lt;3

Resilience, man I forgot about that, ugh I hated it so much. I think this was my biggest gripe with BC.

there were alts, so I don't know how it was limited.
---
A better combo is hard to come by! 
---
&gt; Howdy yall, this gets posted 90 trillion times a day but I’m really struggling in picking either a pally, lock, or priest.  
---
Paladin, warlock, priest  
---
&gt; My main goal is to heal in pve  
---
Paladin, ~~warlock~~, priest  
---
&gt; but as everyone knows are fairly aids at anything ret
---
~~Paladin, warlock~~, priest  
---
&gt; Lock looks appealing but I heard they are squishier than a half-filled air mattress till atleast fully decked in tier 1/2
---
There are pre-raid stam and armor items to help you with this.  
---
&gt; Priest looks really cool but I’ve been told shadow pvp kind of sucks.
---
Lmao
---
&gt; What are the merits of each class? Currently leaning towards priest.  
---
To achieve the maximum proficiency of your goals, priest is the class. They are considered main healers in PVE and heavily used by both factions. They actually have two fun options for damage in PVP, one of which requires a ton of gear.  
---
Shadow, as everyone knows, is insanely powerful in PVP and in addition to melting faces, can also tank a ton of damage. You'll see several shadow priests throughout your time face tanking people while separating the skin from their face rather quickly.  
---
One rather fun thing you can do on a priest after you get a really good damage offset from raiding, is smite/holy fire. There are some amazing crits you can pull off with holy fire, but as I said this is a rather privileged spec that you need gear for, and with that same gear you'd still be better of playing shadow and melting even harder.  
---
There is one caveat: Respec costs. You will have to respec a lot to do both, and you'll quickly max out with the 50g respec fee. 50g is not a small amount of money to regularly be spending in Classic.  
---
First post so testing if it'll work
---
Thing I found with vanilla was there was enough stuff to do throughout the leveling process that you always had something to do or look forward to. Class quests being one of those things. 
---
Private babies... just stop please. You don't know what the word "classic" means, simple as that. I ask you to define to me the world classic, you failed. You bring the flawed logic that just because it was "cycles" and that "1.12 is already a change", somehow should mean that the whole game should start these balance cycles again. This is flawed logic.
---
Godfather is a classic movie bu the last time i watched it the quote "Women and children can be careless, but not Men" is still in the movie. I guess just because times constantly changed, they should remove this to avoid offending people in 2019?
---
Classic is Classic, the very definition of the word means that something that once was, should not be touched.
---
"1.12 classic is already a change, and wow used to change through patches back then". Just ridiculous, using this to justify changes for "classic"....
---
BTW, lets assume they actually start changing though, with different team and different vision. I wonder how you people are so eager? I mean you want classic but you will left changes in the hands of people that made the game in a way that drove you to classic in a first place?
---
What happens if something breaks on the way and suddenly half the content of the game becomes useless, like what happened when ToC and IC got released back in WotLK?
---
You start with one change, you are in for way way more.
---
I think the issue with prot paladins is in a lot of respects, they're far superior to warriors. They're missing a taunt and mana regen, but threat and AoE is through the roof. So you'd have to do a combination of nerfs and buffs, or give Warriors extra tools, overall getting pretty complicated. 
---
But they're actually a pretty easy fix compared to other hybrid specs since they're realistically PvE only. Hybrid DPS specs are almost all solid in PvP, so you don't have much room to buff their PvE DPS. TBC and WotLK (kinda) solved this by giving extra utility, heals, etc. to pure DPS classes and nerfing hybrid utility. It often takes big changes across the board to solve small problems. 
---
We do not really know if we can holy nova the lashers on classic. I don’t remember it to be a thing on retail vanilla for priests (it might not have been known, as holy nova as it is on private serveres came with patch 1.10 which was kind of late vanilla. I can’t find any videos of it either. 
---
Priest can solo princess in Mara. It is decent.
---
Mighty sure of yourself there. 
---
Not sure how your troglodyte brain read that I said it went smoothly. Read it again, and read it slow this time so you understand. 
---
1. Yes. The damage increase from using it manually to save a little extra focus for claw is too small for the effort.
---
2. Attack speed proc. Your pet will be fine with its base health which is already really high.
---
3. Use scorpid sting to remove a different sting from the enemy so it can be trapped.
---
Chuck me a link too? Would really appreciate it =\].

Hell yeah buddy!!!

I miss those times
---
Amen
---
yea but you have no idea how these systems were deisgned and what they are capable
---
You cant just say doing something wouldlnt be difficult because the entire framework could be designed in a way thta makes it difficult
---
Like previously mentioned you can transmog your gear to look like the grand marshal set at any transmog vendor. This is only accessable to anyone who achieved the original title during vanilla or to anyone achieving a ranked bg rating above 2000, so the look is still kind of prestigous.
---
You can easily sell dungeon runs. Advertise live strat you get first orb or tanking any dungeon all boss drops that aren't needed go to you.  Start mining/enchanting and keep all the ore needed to level blacksmith/eng on a bank alt and swap mining out once arcanite dips in price.
---
Nothing. He's ready to raid her lair.
---
&gt;Blizzard should never have added pallys to horde and the other way around.
---
Yep. I've been saying this one since TBC. 
---
I understand why they did it, but it still sucks.
---
Serpent sting is garbage and a waste of a debuff slot, and it only gets worse as you progress as it gets weaker and weaker compared to other classes. 
---
That'd be absolutely ridiculous because we've already paid for the game.
---
They basically have two options regarding pricing. One is to keep it a separate fee - which would be good for people like US, I'd argue. The other is to make it the same subscription which opens up the option to attract people to BOTH versions of the game, or either, since they're able to test both of them. It's obvious what the best choice is in this matter.
---
1. Agree
---
2. There is enough benefit of either talent that I think people should pick according to personal preference; I usually pick pet health as I like the feeling of having a more robust pet. So class fantasy goes before min/max for me in this case. 
---
3. Agree
---
Because you will be leaving these changes in the hands of people that drove us to want vanilla instead of playing retail. None of the old devs are here, none of their vision exists.
---
If you want vanilla and you haven't played since 2010, there is a high change that you wont trust current blizz with anything classic related. Other than releasing something as close as it was, which is also based on a work which was made by people that no longer work for blizzard.
---
WoW currently is a single player game with mythics at the end, no more RPG, no more class uniqueness. Call me a hatter but there is no way in all hell i will trust current blizz with touching the game that different studio with different vision made.
---
Youre right, I remember it was all Rupture now. It was mostly the attack speed that kept the healers down. You can read the rest of the discussion as I mentioned Hunters and Shaman, but Druids get it in COMBAT and can easily daze a Hunter with moonfire. Shaman can run in WSG and reinforce in AB better, but Druid can both get to caps fast and fight for them in AB.
---
*Somewhere, a cow sheds a solemn tear*
---
Yep that's kinda that fundamental problem with many of vanilla's wonky specs. To be worthwhile you need to really work them, and most of the players willing to really work their class would rather play a class/spec that actually functions, so its hard to filter out the players who know what they're doing in these specs from the morons. And since even when well played borderline specs aren't that great, the safest thing to do is just write them all off.

Mulgore is one of my favorite zones. It's so calm when you play there in the morning.

**&lt;undecided&gt; Semi-HC** Alliance, EU
---
**Who are we and who are we looking for?**
---
We're a guild consisting of 2 small groups that merged together. We're looking for likeminded people willing to experience classic wow without committing all of their free time. Needless to say, effort does still get rewarded, and we still aim for good progress. Our group partly consists of both experienced and inexperienced players, so your experience with the content isn't an important factor. Anyone new to vanilla/classic is free to join as well. We'd like to keep a good atmosphere, so just being kind is more important to us than a few extra dps.
---
**Raid information**
---
Monday and Tuesday: 19:00 - 23:00 (+-30min, GMT +1)
---
Wednesday optionally
---
Loot will be handled by the loot council.
---
For any questions or information, don't hesitate to message me. (tom#8446)
---
It’s vanilla. If your guild isn’t run by actual no-lifers, it basically doesn’t matter. You can easily clear all content using a few off specs. More than anything else, doing your job and not making mistakes will always be king in vanilla. 
---
Lmao really? Retail never fails to surprise me with how down hill it's gone.  
---
Enhancements are top tier DPS on their own not even counting totems.
---
We'd already paid for SC and War3 too, those remasters cost money. And it's not ridiculous, it's not like they flipped a switch and started selling vanilla again, a very large number of developer hours have gone into this project, that costs money.
---
I'm hearing that's called "base game"  
---
I think Vanilla talents work better with Vanilla, but I agree that BC talents were the best. I think WoTLK opened up too many avenues that made classes feel more similar rather than more unique. 
---
BC has the best class design of any expansion, imo. I don’t even care about arenas or how ever class has to be 100% balanced for it to be “fair”. Fuck that! Every class was fun and felt like it had its own fantasy. 
---
Vanillas specs were unique, but only half of them were endgame viable. Meanwhile, BC added 3 total specs to each faction, and made almost every spec viable, yet more unique. 
---
But this should just be a reason for us to want BC also. Maybe if that’s what you’re looking for, just join a level 60 guild on a BC server 3 years from now. I’m sure some will exist. 
---
As an addendum to this comment worth mentioning that Alliance also has access to Stockades (not that interesting) and Deadmines (very fun, in my opinion), and Gnomer (fairly fun). 
---
So it's not like they have no options for levelling dungeons. 
---
10k on Nost != 6 million split over 6 servers.
---
Even if only 10% of people with subscriptions play you are still talking about 10x more than Nost and 25x original pops. There are still practical limits to server and engine architecture. Why would they invest into revolutionary tech, when they already have the tools to deal with it.
---
The "sharding" they are talking about, could more accurately be called instancing starting areas. What they have described is equivalent to making a demo starting area instance for the first weeks. Once you clear that you get kicked into gen. pop., once new toon numbers subside they disabled it.
---
Seems like a lot of people are #nochanges without even thinking about the practical reality of a launch of this magnitude. I'll bet that most are tourists anyway who have only seen p.servers. 
---
Who told you that you cant? Stop lying please. You may be benched in a guild like method but no one will deny you a spot just because you are ret paladin. 
---
This is the thing that annoys me the most, the myth that you will be benched because you aren't furry warrior. Don't know what game you have been playing but unless you are in a hardcore guild, no one would deny you a spot for not being one of the 150 mages.
---
Well it helps that OPs opinion is well stated and isn’t actually calling for changes. If someone just posted “Vanilla talents suck, the game will fail if they don’t change them” without any nuance or backing, then that would rightfully deserve downvotes.
---
&gt; Hearthstone also started as a passion project.
---
Completely different topics though. Hearthstone has been made from scratch up and it's intention was to generate income. WoW: Classic on the other hand is a way for Blizzard to show they care about their fanbase.
---
&gt; Dungeon group finder - $10
---
&gt; Raid group finder expac - $5
---
&gt; cash shop mounts - various
---
Ridiculous. I understand some skepticism but actually believing that this would happen is nothing but dumb. And I really mean DUMB. Blizzard started WoW Classic to give us the Classic experience. They've stated it from the get go and EVERYTHING they've done so far pretty much shows me that they mean it.
---
There's controversy (Loot, Sharding), yes, I get that, but I'm sure that these things will work themselves out in an acceptable matter. But these things are SO FAR AWAY from anything cash-shop / premium-services related that it's really just dumb to think blizzard would go this way. They know that they would lose the people that they are so desperate to keep as customers.
---
I'm firmly believing that the reason classic exists is not because "they want to do it" but rather that they see it as a great opportunity to keep the disengaging playerbase engaged for quite a bit longer. So many "older" gamers have said goodbye to the retail wow experience because it's just not the game that we've come to love anymore. They did classic to give us back what we're missing out on (and to earn money on the sidelines - that's what the subscription is there for).
---
Oh my god this is horrible on every level, I love it.
---
I recall being more interested in pet health myself.  Pet damage was the secondary concern to making sure my pet just held aggro and didn’t die to the heavier hitting stuff.
---
I also used Scorpid sting a bit more with that philosophy in mind, the idea being elites hitting not quite so hard meant more time for me to pepper them with arrows.  This was before I figured out kiting though.  
---
I'm not looking for magic. I want to play a nice MMORPG.
---
Proof 
---
I‘m pretty sure there are many people working as a lawyer and not able to articulate like this. Talking like this is hard training, he mastered it
---
I remember doing dungeons while leveling in both TBC and WotLK... chain pulling was the norm for our group.  We weren't over-geared, and some of the group was completely new in both cases.
---
That's not to say classes weren't balanced better in TBC and WotLK, or that certain specs being made viable for content is bad.  It is, however, to say that Classic is not at all balanced for the overall improvements to classes that came with TBC and WotLK.
---
Why not both?
---
And exactly how is that different from the video linked, which has always been the only definitive statement from Blizzard on Classing sharding (i.e. the first few weeks) ?
---
Well, you do have a point with this one. But those games are different to WoW because SELLING them is their business model. There's no monthly fee attached to it. WoW on the other hand will earn much more due to their monthly fee and I would argue that a lot of players simply wouldn't "accept" having to pay 30bucks again for something they also have to pay a monthly fee for.
---
So just wait a few weeks when the crush passes and sharding is disabled?
---
So ? That means the game should be changed again? Flawed logic. Unless you can define me the word classic and in which world it means that it should be changed.
---
Vanilla ended with TBC, which means Vanilla is over, recreating it and continuing the balance cycles just because it used to have them turns it into frankenstein's monster-game. Battle for azeroth is a direct result of the changes you speak off, maybe go play this.
---
It should be released about 4 years before Classic. 
---
That last paragraph... so edgy. Name calling and then asking for a big boi discussion... unironically...
---
The Division was horrible though, and Division 2 is likely to be just as bad.
---
1 cost gets you a sub to both retail and classic, I don't think they care if it "clashes" with retail.
---
Hand of Edward the Odd was my first epic drop. I remember it dropping in Silithus (when it still was unfinished) when I grinded the last few levels to 60 . It financed my epic mount quest :)
---
Nost didnt have 10k people roll on it day 1, let alone an expected 100k per server at the launch of classic.
---
Nost grew much like Vanilla wow did. Population had time ro spread out. Even still, when new realms were launched it was a clusterfuck, something that was never the case with Vanilla.
---
The implementation of sharding Blizz have described so far sounds more like starting zone instances at launch to avoid the clusterfuck and provide more of a Vanilla start.
---
For the Alliance!
---
- recent convert 
---
Thank you. 
---
Remember that pets are one level lower 6 bars of exp into every new level. It doesn’t mean that a member of your group your level passes without aggro that your pet one level lower will as well. 
---
I want a 1440P version of this for a background
---
Didn’t know about that till now! Nice!
---
And the act of many players not accepting paying $30 is exactly why it would solve the tourist problem.
---
Had a great time in vanilla retail when they released arenas for a while before TBC came out. Went something like 120-3 as shadow priest/warlock. Rogue/mage was also great, warrior/healer etc etc. Hunters didn’t seem as strong as they were at the beginning of the game. Your typical comps were pretty good, but I’m sure it came more down to individual ability. 
---
Both is certainly fine, but people who are playing for nostalgia or for some magical addictive feeling alone are the same people who suddenly ghost their guild when the feeling passes.
---
They also changed the whole itemization do go with this, AKA pruning fun items and RPG elements. I wish you people remember this when you start worshiping WotlK. 
---
I wouldn't even give alliance gnomer... the transporter in booty bay is pretty awesome for horde.
---
They should add seasons and weather effects.
---
Yup, ilvl is basically the only thing that matters now, you need to reach minimum ilvls to get into dungeons and raids, and instead of asking how much experience you have before getting invited, people just insta invite you if you have a good ilvl, even though gear can just randomly jump 100+ ilvl because blizz likes making basic dungeon gear be better thain raid gear.
---
It's pretty awful.
---
Fury warriors wear a ton of leather and sometimes mail though. It would come up quite a lot. Just say you are there to roll on the fury pieces also. If anyone doesn't like it they can drop out to another group, but it's hard to replace a tank.
---
Haven't said anything on it. Still deciding. I would like to see it go. There are good players that just love the class fantasy of Holy Paladin and I would like to see them stand out more. I really don't know who the good Paladins are because of decursive and autoplay on priorities and that should never happen. 
---
&gt;First off this isn't what we're getting nor is it what the no-changers are asking for. What they want is a recreation of their private server experience, not a recreation of WoW as it was.
---
It is exactly what we are getting. Once all the content is rolled out it will mirror vanilla 1.12 as close as Blizzard manages to capture it.
---
&gt;Having a frozen state of balance is antithetical to recreating Vanilla.
---
I would argue differently. 1.12 was the longest active patch in vanilla and the playerbase was at its peak. Most people who think about vanilla will remember 1.12 especially.
---
&gt;Why should a carbon-copy be the goal or the "point of the project.
---
Because this is what the community asked for the last 10 years or so and Blizzard agreed with this concept. They said they want someone who fell asleep since 1.12 release until classic release to not notice a difference.
---
Are there any similar guides for other classes? I love the detail put into this but I dont want to play a warlock
---
Here :)

---
Okay, I never messed with transmog. I’ll look into that thank you!
---
i always go skinning/mining to get gold/mats cheaper for 1.3 DM mount quest, then go engi/tailoring.
---
In your defence that does not sound logical or intuitive at all.
---
I picked up a keyboard with MX Speed keys awhile ago, I liked that a lot (the actual keyboard didn’t work well though)
---
Highly doubt it.
---
Wotlk and TBC were great. Even though in Wotlk, once ToC and IC came out, it made 80% of the content useless/brainded easy.
---
Every one speaks of balance and better specs, completely forgetting that the price for these was, massive downgrade in wacky items and RPG aspects. There is no such thing as balance, if you were benched in vanilla, you will be benched now in BFA. Hardcore guilds didn't care about feelings then and this still apply to BFA, where whole specs are still benched, and people are forced to play other things to raid at high levels, believe it or not at this level its even worse now than before.
---
More casual guilds however would never EVER bench you lesser spec, especially back before mythics because pretty much everything was done with even casual raiding guilds.
---
And if you say that you couldn't raid with your Ret paladin, you are lying or you did something disgustingly wrong back then. I swear this myth will drive far more people for the wrong reasons.
---
I played from open beta all the way through vanilla (and other xpacs) 
---
I originally played alliance all the way upto 60. It was fun no doubt, loved the defias quest lines and the early level zones are some of my favs.
---
I switched mid way through vanilla to Horde to play a shaman... and I never looked back. The early zones lack the beauty in scenery but there was better access to dungeons, there was a better STV experience, (hills brad sucks tho) but in my experience what made the difference was the comradery  in the open world.
---
This I guess holds true for PvP servers (never played anything else) but even in hillsbrad you could count on fellow horde players to protect you in PvP even when they are outleveled. When I played alliance we would often start some crap with 1 - 3 horde players... but the next minute they turned into 3-6 players or just some high level one out of the wood work.
---
This held true when I switched to horde, other players were actively helping you in fights. I felt "most" randoms on alliance wouldn't stop to help you but rather give you a lecture on "well just find another spot, do a different quest, go to the AH for a while."
---
So if nothing else For the Horde!
---
Also Orc's make better rogues and warlocks :P
---
&gt; Why do you think that?
---
Because the WoW is ass right now. The "vision" of perfectly balancing everything lead to class homogenization but there is also lots of other stuff wrong with the game.
---
Almost no vanilla devs work at Blizzard anymore. They didn't release a good game since ages. Overwatch is decent but they have Jeff Kaplan (vanilla game director).
---
Blizzard is not the same company it was 10 years ago. Activision inlfuence is spreading and people are anxious that they are going to ruin Classic.
---
My issue is they kept making the trees deeper and never considered going wider apparently. 
---
Imagine if every time they increased the depth they also added 2-5 talent options as a new "branch" on the talent "tree".
---
What I mean is look at vanilla Subtlety you see Premed takes 31 points or level 40: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f
---
Now check out the BC talents: http://calculators.iradei.eu/talents/rogue
---
Subtlety got Cheat Death 3, Enveloping Shadows 3, Sinister calling 5, Shadowstep.
---
But if you compare the vanilla to the classic we see that I'm classic you could get your final talent, Premeditation, and still have 20 talent points left. 
---
Compare to BC where you have the exact we out of points left... we should be having more flexibility as we become more powerful.
---
Shadowstep should have been a 35 point talent, the deepest one in BC, with Enveloping Shadows moved down to that empty spot next to Master of Deception. Then Deadlines moved down to a new branch of above Hemorrhage. Put Sinister Calling where Deadliness *was* and move ShadowStep down. 
---
That's the kind of expansion I was hoping for. Not just vertical but horizontal as well.
---
"No changers are going to win more than they think"  
---
1. For the most part. Sometimes you want to control threat, but for leveling it's not that big of a deal.
---
2. Pet health. You can tank multiple mobs with your pet, the proc doesn't pop enough and you don't do enough dps relative to your pet for it to matter. I think this one is mainly down to personal preference, but I've used both extensively and the extra health with pet micro is the best.
---
3. Leaf quest.
---
Keep those rose colored glasses on.
---
Are you asking for proof or is that a statement.
---
The two featured in the poster are almost 100% the guild master and his girlfriend.  
---
Was waiting for the bear to come back :(
---
Huh, I used to be a bit of a #NoChanges dude but you actually convinced me here. I played vanilla wow and you're right, constant change was a key feature of it.
---
1. Growl on, too much micromanagement otherwise. 
---
2. 1 point in attack speed and 4 in health, not much difference between 1% and 5% chance but at least it will proc with a point in. Extra health always. 
---
3. I never use it myself but I guess a bit of damage reduction or to cancel another sting. 
---
Get your unarmored mounts for only 19,99 before they take a rest in the Blizzard vault!

Frankly I’m just worried about getting bored of dpsing in PvE. I remember rolling a healer and having a lot more fun. Actually I started playing mage on a pserver and found it a little boring compared to most classes. Now ofc there’s PvP but that’s not my main focus, I think I’ll be happy PvPing as whatever 
---
Or the stars align for the warrior and he procs Hand of Justice and sword swing off his melee autohit and mortal strike. 
---
Pewpew. 5k damage in 1second :(
---
Honestly i think announcing it beforehand like that (along with imbalances) would likely make it even worse.  Quite a few servers on live were slightly imbalanced and it just kept snowballing more and more because people went there so they wouldnt get ganked as easily.  
---
I'm talking AQ/Naxx. Even in MC the guilds I was in only brought 3 during these days. Locks unfortunately didn't have the best DPS in the vanilla days. Mages and combat rogues just tore up charts. 
---
Let the bodies hit the floor.....
---
Taunt him because he grinded R12 legs, but didn't manage to get to R14 for weps. Newb!
---
In terms of consistency, it was the right move. But damn there was something about 1 shooting someone with hand of rag wf crit.
---
I would of sold my soul for might of menethil though
---
Staff of Jordan off a troll in ZG. I was grouped with a dude who was on the other side of the zone and thankfully didn’t let him have the option to roll for it, so it was all mine. Sold it for a few hundred gold and never had to worry about gold again until 60
---
Warrior needs to really hardmode things to be successful. They require a ton of time invested to take, to PvP, etc. Shaman will get their tier sets quickly, are extremely versatile, will get offspec gear quickly. Plus, a good healbot shaman to another warrior in BGs is ridiculous. 
---
If I were playing horde, I'd be a shaman hands down, but my guild is going ally for easy raiding. :(
---
I have to disagree, it was likely driven by tech.
---
40.
---
There was no player cap on dungeons in early vanilla, you could have up to 40 people (max group size) in them. It wasn't until 1.4 or 1.5 that they set a limit of 10 on most instances, and then reduced it to 5, except for UBRS which you could still bring 10.
---
Ahh gotcha, didn't know that! But true, just start the group yourself :) perk of being a tank
---
Yeah Druid is at the top of my list.. healing as Druid does seem pretty fun, you don’t have quite as many tools, but you still have hots and ranks of HT to play with, and tanking dungeons is pretty fun too. 
---
👌
---
Orc female. Aesthetics are great, animations are great, you don't get the awkward movement that males get. Plus, orc is bar none the best race for rogues on horde, that stun resistance is broken as fuck. 
---
Enchanting is bad
---
You won't pull aggro if you have Imp VW
---
&gt; the gnome in the EK loading screen was just an ingame model superpositioned on the art, lol
---
I mean, [so is the Undead](https://i.imgur.com/ArLl4hZ.png).
---
you can take a boat from auberdine to theramore?
---
I don't think this is an unpopular opinion at all. TBC and WotLK gameplay and class design was definitely better than vanilla. They were worse at other things though.
---
Druids are the best dungeon tanks in Vanilla. You literally have no idea what you're talking about
---
I have a very strong emotional memory of running scarlet monastery while listening to Face Down by Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. Also training in Nagrand (I know, not vanilla) while listening to The Offspring
---
Congratz the content a hunter pet can tank, yay.
---
Yup. There are pluses and minuses of being any class on either faction and it's balanced pretty well. Take another one people think is one sided. Rogues on horde have to deal with perception and blind immunity from dwarves. If they choose undead to deal with desperate prayer then they are at a big disadvantage vs dwarf and human rogues. Meanwhile dwarf can deal with devouring plague by immuning it and immune blind as well in rogue vs rogue and getting restealths other races can't simply can't be underestimated. That seems like it heavily favors alliance in wpvp (dwarfs) and premades (humans), but then you have the orc racial and it's more balanced and while you can argue for dwarf, human, orc, undead there is really no "winner". 
---
People just inject biases into it too much. I like to look at it more like flavors. What class ticks you off that you want to counter more. If I was a lock I would probably be gnome to be honest. Just to make mages lose their sh%# with felhunter dispel and escape artist.  Rogues are also pretty garbage in BG's and Warriors are all orcs these days. The thing people fear is only in wpvp and you will beat most rogues just having invuln pots. Add to that the gnome racial gets you out of slows so it's good vs rogues AND warriors which are a plague in BG's in 1.12. 
---
Since when was herod's shoulders and raging berserker helm not mail?
---
&gt;Which talent is better in the first tier of the BM tree? The attack speed proc or the pet health?
---
Pet health until around 20.  Your pet has a tendency to die during the early periods and it really sucks before you have improved pet rez.  Once you get to around 20 respec to attack speed.
---
&gt;When the fuck do you ever use scorpid sting? Seriously, against mana users it's usually viper, and against everyone else why use scorpid over serpent sting?
---
Buy rank 1, keep it around to remove damage stings from mobs that are being CCed.
---
Tears
---
I heard that holy level until shadow form was the way to go in vanilla ? 
---
you need to view it with a computer, not your phone
---
&gt; Locks unfortunately didn't have the best DPS in the vanilla days. Mages and combat rogues just tore up charts. 
---
That's absolutely true. If anyone is going to play a 'lock in Classic it shouldn't be for the DPS, but for the proverbial [church organ](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/53/6e/88/536e88ecb5bd5292a4bc163a8b33df22.jpg) of buttons to press.
---
Mages are ungodly flag runners if they know what they're doing, but can struggle in group PvP where their squishiness shows off. Warlock dots will ravage enemy teams, curse of tongues will annoy healers, fear spam can further cause problems for enemies, and you'll be marginally tankier than mages, but also far less mobile. 
---
Mages are more geared for solo play, locks for team play. If you decide to raid, locks become absolute raid bosses when they get gear. 
---
I'm the same problem but opposite. I feel huge loyalty to my Horde druid. Mulgore feels like going home. BUT my first alt was a Nelf hunter, and I definitely want to do that again. And it sounds like Alliance might be better for a druid. I also want to roll a lock, and would prefer human for that. It makes sense to group alts for profession support. And Alliance would be new (my Nelf never got far) I don't know whether to treat this as a new game, or as going home. 
---
Simple does not mean easy or low skill ceiling. I mean the spells are pretty straight forward. For example mage's or rogue's spkills are straight forward as well. Doesn't say anything about utility, tricks, or potential for skilled plays
---
&gt;  not much difference between 1% and 5% chance but at least it will proc with a point in. Extra health always.
---
1 in a hundred vs 1 in twenty is a huge difference.
---
how often to Rogues get stunned? In my mind something like warlock is surely more useful 
---
Strongly disagree. I see myself playing classic for a good amount of time. But by no means would I pay 30bucks upfront PLUS the monthly fee. Because THIS would be exactly what ACTIVISION Blizzard 
---
would do
---
no, youre right
---
bound to make some errors
---
I am correcting it
---
If you plan on pvping as mostly shadow, Troll is BiS. 
---
PVP Healing is Undead.
---
PVE Healing troll slightly better but at the same time, WoTF has some useful scenarios. 
---
Both are great, I personally prefer Undead for aesthetics and getting some gear for shadow can take some time, but it's up to you really. 
---
Holy crap allakazhams! Not been on there since the EQ days
---
&gt; Pet health until around 20. Your pet has a tendency to die during the early periods and it really sucks before you have improved pet rez. Once you get to around 20 respec to attack speed.
---
Why not just manage your pets health for those 6 levels and skip the respec?
---
Must have them mixed up with some other faction whose quests involve you murdering, torturing, and performing horrible experiments on people minding their own business and even their own allies while laughing about it, then.
---
It only takes one stun to kill most rogues. 
---
Also, far more often than you'd think. 
---
I think they meant that certain pservers, naming no names, nerfed the lasher farm/pickpocket farm to encourage the buying of gold, which the server owners would spawn and sell to 3rd party websites, along with rank 14 pvp chars. Said server owners would then ban the people who bought the gold as an encore.
---
&gt;It is exactly what we are getting. Once all the content is rolled out it will mirror vanilla 1.12 as close as Blizzard manages to capture it. 
---
It is true that once all the content is released, it will be at its closest state to 1.12. Though one should point out that if the server caps are raised which seems fairly likely, it will be still be substantially different, because playing on a 5k or 10k pop server really changes a huge amount of the gaming experience compared to playing on a 2k pop server.
---
Regardless, there's still going to be a huge amount of time before the release of Naxx in which the balance will be very different from what was blizzlike because of the 1.12 talents. For example, the warrior vs enhancement shaman example in progression MC. 
---
If Blizzard really wanted to get at what you're suggesting, they could have just opened the servers with all the content already released. That idea was wildly unpopular among this community and viewed as a worst case scenario. Hell - even the amount of progressive release they gave us at blizzcon wasn't enough, and this community pleaded for even more, which made it more match the private server schedule. Blizzard listened, and that was the source of all the celebration this week.
---
&gt;I would argue differently. 1.12 was the longest active patch in vanilla and the playerbase was at its peak. Most people who think about vanilla will remember 1.12 especially.
---
Sure, but most people who think about vanilla will remember that there were patches. I certainly remember them, they were ingrained in my memory considering how terrible my internet was back then and how it took all day (and then some) to download a major content patch. I agree that 1.12 is probably the most well known of any particular patch - but it doesn't follow that recreating Vanilla = recreating 1.12. Vanilla was 25 months long (from US release, not counting beta or 2.0) Patch 1.12 was 3 1/2 months long. Your argument would be strong if Patch 1.12 was like 10+ months long or something, but that's just not how it was. 
---
&gt;Because this is what the community asked for the last 10 years or so and Blizzard agreed with this concept. They said they want someone who fell asleep since 1.12 release until classic release to not notice a difference.
---
And yet, instead of releasing a 1.12 version with all the content out, which was easily within their power, they've decided to do the private server progressive content release style. And it seems likely they'll raise the server caps. 
---
This community, who you say want a carbon copy, simply don't. The fact that blizzard is deviating so hard from the carbon copy by giving the progressive release schedule (and probably raised server caps) is in RESPONSE to what they perceive as the want of the community. 
---
So yeah, I might be willing to cede that what Blizzard is giving us is what the community asked for. But it is simply factually incorrect to say what they asked for was a carbon copy of Vanilla. What they've asked for is a carbon copy of their private server experience, and I hate to break it to you, but Blizzard has listened to them.
---
&gt;I never played on a private server and want as little change as possible.
---
Well I'm sorry but that is self-consciously not what blizzard is giving you because your voice has been co-opted by the private server community. 
---
*Drowning intensifies*
---
Fact. PvP was a pain in the ass. Probably why I loved Destro in PvP so much. Less buttons, but also so much more burst once you started getting all the crit gear from AQ. 
---
You heard it here first, folks.
---
Didn't they later confirm in a blue post there will be sharding but to what extent they had not decided. Likey starting zones for sure.

First of all, wonderful insult. You must be super cool, smart and stuff. Really adds to the discussion.
---
I interpreted your statement of " Never in Vanillas history did it involve 800 people in Northshire." as a contradiction to me stating there'd be an initial cluster fuck of people in starting zones without sharding, as there was, from at least my experience, on vanillas launch. 
---
What am I missing?
---
Slippery slope is a logical fallacy 
---
I still have my late vanilla 19 twinks. I should through some pics up tomorrow xD
---
the magic im talking about is the adventure aspect of classic. the journey.
---
Theres nothing left to do there. Just F
---
I leveled a warrior on a new server halfway through vanilla(switching from alliance to horde).  I found it easier than leveling fire mage and I had a blast doing it.  One tip: Do herbing/alchy while leveling.  You're going to need a lot of pots for leveling and tanking.  
---
&gt;Classic WoW is same for me as for anyone else here.
---
Incorrect
---
How much do you think they would they charge for a beaten dead horse skin?

Tool hasn't actually released a specific date. They said may to July. But it's tool it can change. I am so excited beyond belief. Last week has been full of nothing but Tool a perfect circle and puscifer for me. Back in my vanilla days i listened to tool and audioslave on repeat.

I wonder what 2005 me would've thought if I told him he'd be playing the same two games in 2019.
---
That's unfortunate, but that's not what Classic is about. At least you'll still have private server launches.
---
*Lights cigarette*
---
It was good for me, was it good for you?
---
That’s how I got mine to drop as well.  
---
I wasn't saying it would happen for certain, just that it might.
---
Well I was thinking meet my friend and hand him all the food and water to distribute to the party. Then log into my main and join the group and have him give me my share.
---
But what about a few months into the games life cycle when all of the tourists and fair weather fans have given up and quit leaving you with a much less busier server than you'd ideally like?  I think even the most ambitious classic fans will admit that not everyone will stick around long term and imo capping it so low for release just hurts the game long term. 
---
I'm absolutely no changes all the way until it comes to this exact point. I want there to be a living breathing and active community when the game is well over a year into its life cycle but to me capping it at 2.5k for release will prevent this almost entirely. In a game like Vanilla the community and social interactions play such a large part in the enjoyment and immersion and losing 35% of your realm after a few months will hurt these aspects. I'm not advocating for a 10k cap like on a private server but at least up it to 3-4k to account for the initial loss we will all receive after the initial hype phase dies down so we can be left with a solid blizzlike population of dedicated long term players.
---
I doubt that this will happen but in an ideal world I hope Blizz have 2.5k capped realms for players like yourself  to play on and then also have some slightly higher ones for people like myself so we don't have to run the risk of picking a shit realm with loads of casuals and tourists and then face server mergers etc further down the line which open up even more problems.   
---
&gt; And when classic wow has better numbers than retail, you think investors will ignore it?
---
Classic will never overtake Retail, the mass market is too concentrated with casual players which retail excels at. The people who think Classic will crush retail and overtake MMO supremacy are living in a fantasy land oblivious to the reality of the current gaming landscape. 
---
I'm not saying Classic will fail or die off, in fact it be a bastion for a fair sized community of players, it's just that the community of players who prefer the style of game that is Classic pales in comparison to those who don't.
---
They’ve confirmed that there will be no crossover between retail and classic. 
---
I asked about addon that displays item level and detailed info on character tab. Actually I found it myself. 
---
It's **DejaCharacterStats**
---
Find a guild / group that you will enjoy playing with, and roll that faction.
---
Since you were not planning to play Sham or Pal, no amount or Horde Vs. Alliance nuances will matter in the long run, when we are talking hundreds or thousands of hours in it's ALL about enjoying who you play with.
---
I've never played Allies in Vanilla, and I really do not like Allies in general, but if I found a group of good players that I want to spend the next couple years with playing Allies I'd do it in a heartbeat.
---
Nope. That's addon called DejaCharacterStats
---
I always assumed there will be an upfront cost with a sub that will simply be shared with retail.
---
I recall most people saying that the difference between 1% attack speed proc and 5% isin't felt that much and to dedicate 4 talent points into wasn't really worth it. I personally put 1 point into the attack speed proc and went into pet health.
---
What you're describing is a logical fallacy. That's not really how things usually work. 
---
People said this about marriage for example "oh, if a man can marry a man then it's a slippery slope until your daughter can marry an actual wildebeest".

Hi, /u/BuzzerBeater911
---
You seem to have really gotten stuck on my (are least I felt) obviously exaggerated examples, and no time arguing my point.
---
The point remains you give a publicly traded company an inch, and if there investors ever see $$ the Blizz classic team will immediately capitulate to every single demand the shareholders have, because they are indeed slaves to the shareholders wishes.
---
TFW when the all of the Tool song character names are already taken on your server. 
---
I meant why the 15k pixels? the azeroth map is not detailed at that level in your picture. Zooming in is blury/pixelated. On PC screen.
---
Are you still together or was that player move ALL FOR NOTHING?!
---
Some zones are slightly darker in BfA, some are slightly brighter. Overall, it's pretty close but I'd have to say BfA has the darker atmosphere at night overall between the two.
---
There's a big difference when you only have one of three zones to choose from vs having over a dozen to choose from. It makes sense to shard those 3 zones and not sharding the 12+
---
Well, I'm still #nochanges, because I simply want TBC and WotLK servers!  But to address your topic, I completely agree on TBC, but I think WotLK was slightly worse.  Let me explain.
---
**TBC**
---
TBC had probably the best class balance the game has ever had.  Every specialization was useful for something, and there wasn't a big push for equality.  All of the classes and specs had their own identity and feel to them.  If classes got drastic changes in TBC, it was mostly because they needed them.  Hybrids needed mana to DPS with, Hunters needed to be able to trap in combat, Paladins needed a viable Protection tree, and so on.  (The biggest negative is that druids still didn't have an OOC rez spell).
---
The one issue is that most of the 41-point talents were so good, you **had** to get them.  This isn't universally true, and some hybrid builds thrived, like the SL/SL Warlock, but in most cases it was 41 points and then you filled out the rest.  
---
**WotLK**
---
The problem with wrath is that now you have 51 points, and the 51-pointer was almost always huge.  Like Beacon of Light, which was basically going to double your healing on a Holy Paladin (even with that, there were Prot heal builds for PVP and Ret Heal Builds for mana efficiency at lower gear values).  
---
The other issue is that homogenization started to happen in WotLK, and instead of trying to fix specs that were barely viable anywhere (like in Vanilla) they started trying to make it so all specs could do everything...and did so horribly.
---
I personally think, in terms of class design, TBC &gt; Vanilla &gt; Wrath, but if you took some elements out of the Wrath changes it would be the best.
---
Is this from a pserver or a screenshot from classic?
---
Is shadow priest a 1v1 pvp spec or still dominate in bgs?
---
I don't think it is still here, to be honest - I don't think there will be a druid truce, I don't think there will be 99% friendly players who were mostly adults, because the player base has changed and most importantly, so has Blizzard. 
---
Everyone I started playing WoW with upon release were moving on from Everquest or Ultima Online and it was something big and new, a 3D world without loading times and it played really well, there was a wonder associated with it because of the way Blizzard communicated with the community too, there was a constantly updated "On the Horizon" thing on the WoW website (half of it didn't come to fruition, where are my siege weapons in AV, Blizz!!) and you'd see GMs in-game all the time, *everyone* involved, developers, CS, players, everyone... was having fun, everything was new. That won't come back, ever.
---
It'll be fun to play it again, but I'm not the same person, Blizzard isn't the same company, but I assume the game will be the same, though!
---
yeah it kinda sucks rn  because i have a 60 on a server i played on about a year ago and now i want to play again but dont want to make a temporary character and remake another in classic but at the same time i wanna play lol

AQ is completely different. The starting experience has players all competing with each other to do quests, the AQ event has players all gathering together to kill mobs (they're raid level monsters you're fighting). The entire point of the AQ event is to have the server come together and experience something together, the whole point of the starting zones is to level your character and experience the character progression .
---
I really like(d) PvP on my warlock, but only truly as an affliction spec. Dot everything in sight, and focus on defending yourself.
---
Warlocks one true weakness in PvP was the long casting time on most spells, and maybe the fact that 80% of the spells are in the Shadow-school so if that school is locked, you're boned.  
---
Apart from that they had a fat stack of hit points ("Warlock Tanking" anyone?), had both the regular Fear spell and the instant cast Deathcoil, had demons that could dispell magic, or charm, they could drain hunters' and paladins' mana fairly easily, have healthstones, and are generally a pain in the ass if they have any allies with them.
---
I love warlock (in Vanilla/Classic) because they're so versatile, even if they'll never top DPS charts.
---
&gt;It is true that once all the content is released, it will be at its closest state to 1.12. Though one should point out that if the server caps are raised which seems fairly likely, it will be still be substantially different, because playing on a 5k or 10k pop server really changes a huge amount of the gaming experience compared to playing on a 2k pop server.

---
I don't care about any of that personally. Naxx at release or Naxx 1 year down the road matters little to me. I simply want to end up at 1.12 one way or another. Waiting a few months is not a "big change" in my eyes.
---
&gt;Sure, but most people who think about vanilla will remember that there were patches. I certainly remember them, they were ingrained in my memory considering how terrible my internet was back then and how it took all day (and then some) to download a major content patch. I agree that 1.12 is probably the most well known of any particular patch - but it doesn't follow that recreating Vanilla = recreating 1.12. Vanilla was 25 months long (from US release, not counting beta or 2.0) Patch 1.12 was 3 1/2 months long. Your argument would be strong if Patch 1.12 was like 10+ months long or something, but that's just not how it was.
---
It is not like every patch brought significant changes to each player individually. Sure most classes changed over all these patches  but it is not like each class was overhauled every patch. If you played one class during vanilla (which most people did) your personal playing experience wouldn't change much except for 1 or 2 patches that adjusted your class more than a few tweaks.
---
Also tbh I think the argument that since vanilla had patches they need to patch in more stuff that wasn't in vanilla to make the game more vanilla is nonsensical.
---
The more stuff you introduce to classic that wasn't in vanilla the more removed we will get from vanilla, obviously. 
---
The only change I would be willing to accept is similar to how OSRS inteoduces new stuff. With a community vote and 75% required to pass.
---
&gt;And yet, instead of releasing a 1.12 version with all the content out, which was easily within their power, they've decided to do the private server progressive content release style. And it seems likely they'll raise the server caps.
---
This community, who you say want a carbon copy, simply don't. The fact that blizzard is deviating so hard from the carbon copy by giving the progressive release schedule (and probably raised server caps) is in RESPONSE to what they perceive as the want of the community.
---
As I said before, as someome who wants as little change as possible none of that matters to me. We will arrive at 1.12 as close to vanilla as Blizzard can do which is what I am interested in. So in the end **we will** end up with a vanilla carbon copy. Despite what "the private server community" might want.
---
I don't know what Blizzard has said about server size so far but we will have to wait and see.
---
&gt;Well I'm sorry but that is self-consciously not what blizzard is giving you because your voice has been co-opted by the private server community.
---
Disagree. It is exactly what I am getting eventually.
---
I got you.. in a few days! Mine is more my journey, what I need to unlock, grab etc. I want everything in one location, and off I go
---
Will do :)
---
Banish is a pain in the ass, it makes the target immune until it ends, it’s very rarely worth casting. Poly works on literally 10x as many mobs and can be ended whenever you want.
---
They're the stock image for humans from the WoW website back then. The right one is Jaina Proudmoore, her outfit was never available to players.
---
Yeah. Warsong Weekends were destruction speced weekends. Arathi Weekends were affliction weekends. Needed the burst to get flags down, needed Curse of Agony to defend mines since it interrupted capping back then. 
---
What do you think the word "almost" means?
---
And are you aware that in WotLK you could lock your xp?
---
This is the worst and best thing I've ever seen, thank you for gracing our world with it.
---
We were all lucky to be able to have wow as a phenom when we did and when we were younger. I think it’s way cooler than fortnaught
---
But feelings are more important than logic! /s
---
Same ! I left off around lvl 40, can"t wait to finally lvl up to max !
---
He is clearly a beta male looking at his gear so I would just grab my girl do a 360 and walk away
---
Stockade Pauldrons in Winterspring from a yeti.
---
TBC talent trees are the best, but I don't want them in Classic.
---
I was in ToM in vanilla as well. I joined back when they first started MC. My hunter was guinsoo my cousin played another hunter tho I cant remember his chars name
---
it actually is that detailed... you must be blind
---
The realistic view of WF is that you have time kiting out of the enemies melee range, dip into melee when your swing timer is ready and then hope WF procs before kiting away to avoid their melee hits.
---
You do this too in pve but use rockbiter. WF change won't get diminished as much against players as the weapon skill isn't factored in.
---
So yes, this takes some skill and if you can't snare your enemy enough to do this, things get rough. Anyone snaring you and attack from range or kites you better makes things very, very rough.
---
I know it's subjective but I know many people who are looking forward to playing classic because of nostalgia. It's not for me to say what Classic is about. For me it's nostalgia, for others it's something else.
---
For many it's going to be a new experience and I understand they may enjoy it with sharding (as will many who don't value authenticity as much as me). 
---
My only point, really, is that I'm saddened that we are getting "Classic" WoW and not "Vanilla".   
---
Initially when I heard of the launch of Classic I got my hopes up too high wishing for a relaunch of WoW. I was hoping for no changes. Fuck me, right?
---
Almost means almost.  Not 50/50.
---
Why would you lock your XP if you're leveling?  That makes no sense.
---
I am adding that and fixing the boat thing
---
Just for you gearscore is the first addon I'm going to install in classic.
---
$6 membrane keyboard.
---
&gt; Anyway, low level battlegrounds make up for maybe 5% of someone's classic experience, if at all. You're making this issue a lot bigger than it is. 
---
That would depend on how much they enjoyed low level battlegrounds, I would think.
---
&gt; Honestly, this sounds the same like if someone would be upset with world pvp and getting ganked by some 60. 
---
The existence of Normal (PvE) servers for people who don't want to be ganked by some sixty does indicate that Blizzard doesn't think this is a crazy opinion.
---
&gt; And what about the fact that people in epics are unfairly matched against greens in the 60 bracket? 
---
This is not a rational argument. "You can't change a bad thing, because there is *another* bad thing!". But in any case the power disparities at sixty are smaller than they are at lower brackets - I've seen twinks with 1250 health in the same battleground as noobs with 250 health. Now granted that noob is an idiot who shouldn't be there, but you don't see sixties with five times the health of other sixties.
---
&gt; And premades? 
---
Same problem. You can't make the perfect the enemy of the good. Arguably premades should be quarantined into fighting other premades but that is a different argument.
---
&gt; Honestly, you can take it far with your type of suggestions.
---
"You can never do anything, because if you do something that means you can do other unrelated things!".
---
Maybe but Blizzard went the slope down once already.
---
thats what people said about runescape.
---
Graphic design is my passion also.
---
Horribly wrong opinion. WOTLK/TBC talent trees are absolute shit. Why? They force you into 41/51 into a single tree because of how mathematically powerful the talents are, giving HUGE bonuses to damage, survival, or healing. The 41/51 point talents are also incredibly strong in every situation - while most of the 31 point talents are niche and not always better than 21 in another tree.
---
41/51 point talent tree's completely killed hybrid specs(outside of a few niche ones) and turned every hybrid class into "Spec into 1 role and then be shit at the other roles", unlike vanilla where you're jack of all trades master of none, you're just a master of 1 in TBC/WOTLK.
---
TBC/WOTLK talent tree's were a mistake, were rushed, and we were not even supposed to go past 51 points into the talent tree after vanilla, it was meant to be 51 forever and we were supposed to get a completely new progression system called path of the titans or something like that and it resembled artifacts in Legion. However, TBC was rushed and they just said "fuck it, add 10 more talents to everyone and give a bunch of new talents in every tree".
---
This led to talents being horribly designed to the point where they had to REMOVE them in a later expansion and replace them with the abomination we have now in BFA.
---
TLDR: WOTLK and TBC talent trees were not intended to even exist, and were something they put in because they were rushed to release the expansions and didn't have enough time to finish their actual design intentions of character progression for later expansions. Talent trees were not meant to go past 51 total talents/31 point trees.
---
They should have just made weapon proc buffs stronger on 2-handers than 1-handers. Just like you have +15 vs +25 agility they could have kept the same enchant but the description would have just said x amount for one-handed weapons and y amount for 2-handed weapons. Not saying double or anything, but yeah it was a pretty big issue. When 1.12.2 or  whatever the pre-tbc patch was called hit and I saw that enhance was seemingly being balanced around DW I gave up my plans for making my shaman my new main and just got my rogue to 70 even though I was mostly just wanting to switch to enhance for pvp.
---
They probably should have just made WF give you passive weapon haste in addition, but only on 2-handers idk. DW didn't fit at all with my idea of a Shaman from WC3 though.
---
That "community" was ruining the game for everyone else. So it is good that it sucks for them.
---
Armorsmith and doing all the damn quests, lots of work little reward if any.
---
Hard disagree bud.
---
&gt; I'm not fan of twinks myself, but what they do is certainly not griefing. It's fair and 100% allowed within the confines the game presents us.
---
Camping lowbies with a raid-geared sixty is allowed within the confines of the game. That doesn't make it fair or mean that it's not griefing.
---
I think my first epic world drop was in WotLK.  It was a 1h sword called Jinra's slicer or something.
---
My first first epic ever equipped was the Nightslayer Chestpiece from Golemagg.  The loot council took pity and saw me rocking a green.  I was so fucking pumped.
---
I am curious how long it takes you to get a wand using the method described in your guide? It mentions running to org at level 5, and then using your hearth to get back to razor hill, and then running to org again. I am concerned that this is a lot of wasted time running back and forth, and that the hearthstone usage will cause you to not be able to to hearth when Joanna's guide asks you to.

---
This makes a lot of sense. A bunch of 10-14s in your WSG group is close to a guaranteed loss.
---
You dont know how good paladins are until you don't have them.
---
Yes, that's kind of the point, you add xp to battlegrounds and an xp lock option for those who want it. The twinks are then the ones with xp locked.
---
If people want to be OP for a little while and then level out of the bracket I don't see a major problem.
---
Early leveling is get the best wand you can, and put points in improved wand and whatever else really til shadow.
---
Nice try staysafe but you're not getting the code to my bank account 
---
GM and his girlfriend. Be quiet.  
---
I liked TBC better in a lot of ways, but WotLK is what made me and probably 80% of the irl friends I knew quit retail for good and never want to come back until the Classic announcement. 
---
Horde has better flight points. If you want to be a Warlock, you definitely should roll Horde, and NOT JUST because 1/4 of Horde players have WotF -- There are literally no lock trainers for Alliance on Kalimdor. Like, the entire continent. Wtf Blizz.
---
Rolling horde also gets you cool stuff like [Rune of the Guard Captain] trinket, which will serve as Pre-BiS for a lot of AP-based DPS classes before getting your Force of Will, Blackhand's, and whatnot.
---
Horde Tauren heal animation is apparently also the same as their hearthstone (We will find out for sure on release), so as a Druid or Shaman of that race, you might be able to bait stuff like Mage Counterspell with your hearth.
---
Disagree all you want, it was a design decision. Yes a technical limitation existed but it was higher than their chosen cap.
---
Proof [in this clip](https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=2368)
---
&gt;I don't care about any of that personally. Naxx at release or Naxx 1 year down the road matters little to me. I simply want to end up at 1.12 one way or another. Waiting a few months is not a "big change" in my eyes.
---
If they use the same private server release schedule, it will be well over a year until Naxx comes out. 
---
So to be clear, in progression MC with frozen 1.12, fury warriors are doing over double the DPS of enhancement shamans. In actual live (at least prior to 1.4) enhancement was on par, if not better than fury. This is not a "big change" to you? Well great - not even the most ambitious pro balance changes advocate wants anything even close to that. If this is small for you, then what I'm asking for is microscopic. 
---
And just to be clear, it seems more likely than not that the server size will be much larger, which is a big change, no matter how you cut it.
---
&gt;It is not like every patch brought significant changes to each player individually. Sure most classes changed over all these patches but it is not like each class was overhauled every patch. If you played one class during vanilla (which most people did) your personal playing experience wouldn't change much except for 1 or 2 patches that adjusted your class with more than a few tweaks.
---
I mean warrior got buffs in 1.5, 1.6 (talent overhaul), 1.7, 1.8 (normalization), 1.11 (shield slam increased threat). 
---
I also don't really see where you're with this. As best I can tell you're saying "Yes most players experienced changes to their class, not just a purely static class. Therefore, having a purely static class is closer to the Vanilla experience." Obviously you couldn't have meant this, so please correct me.
---
&gt;Also tbh I think the argument that since vanilla had patches they need to patch in more stuff that wasn't in vanilla to make the game "more vanilla" is nonsensical. The more stuff you introduce to classic that wasn't in vanilla the more removed we will get from vanilla, obviously.
---
Well I guess we have to agree to disagree. I think a game that had 12 major patches, + and like 4-5x as many smaller patches is Vanilla. You think a static snapshot of how it ended is Vanilla. 
---
&gt;As I said before, as someome who wants as little change as possible none of that matters to me. We will arrive at 1.12 as close to vanilla as Blizzard can do which is what I am interested in. So in the end we will end up with a vanilla carbon copy. Despite what "the private server community" might want.
---
No, probably not. At the very least, the server size will probably be larger, causing a big difference.
---
And I don't understand why it doesn't matter to you - these are substantial changes for longs periods of time. Most of the players who pick up the game are going to experience these changes and put the game down before all the content is released. 
---
Whether it matters to you or not doesn't change the fact that it matters a whole lot to the people who asked for it, and that it is in fact a change...
---
&gt;Disagree. It is exactly what I am getting eventually.
---
See above. 
---
Honestly, it's not that bad. And Warrior isn't that bad even pre 40. Yes, playing one will require you to farm way more dungeons since it's gear dependent, but on the other hand- it's a very rewarding class once you gear it (since the early levels too!)
---
&gt; Does heirloom gear exacerbate the issue on live servers? 
---
Oh yes. It basically brought twinks back. People could and did get full heirloom sets, rampage in WSG with a twinked rogue or warrior against levellers, then roll a new one and delete the old one when it got to level twenty.
---
I think leveling a warrior alone will be pretty painful. I'll be 2 boxing a warrior and a priest and the priest carries the warrior for the first 20 levels or so with wanding alone :p It's just very convenient for the priest to have a meat shield and the warrior takes over as the damage dealer later on when he gets some gear and talents.

I stun her, and stab her, and kill her within 12 seconds while naked and only holding a starting zone dagger, thereafter I will sit my boney ass on her face and cannibalize her corpse.
---
Guess what I will be maining in classic!
---
My gaming passion kinda died as well. Time cannot move fast enough for classic to bring all the passion back. 
---
Same, got it in Searing Gorge, cant remember off what. Sold it for about 240g, used it buy Lord Alexander's Battle Axe and have some pocket cash.
---
runescape combined hits about 100k players concurrently, wow is much larger than that.
---
I'm leaning towards druid atm. My goal is to heal at lvl 60. My questions are:
---
If I level as feral will i be able to heal dungeons with healing gear? If not is boomkim the better lvling option if I want to heal?
---
I have heard that ppl are reluctant to bring resto druids to 5-man, is the general opinion that resto druids are only for raiding or just the most hardcore/picky players? 
---
You won't touch any ranged dps if they're not complete shit
---
It really is 2004 all over again!
---
You're right but I don't see how this is classic related
---
Because it was the best one
---
Name the item and I can tell U the normal price for a fresh serv
---
I can kinda see what you mean, but on the other hand, I can't really say that I agree. yeah, there are straightforward, easy-to-use spells, but...
---
take, for example, mind control: one use is throwing people off cliffs - pretty clear-cut, that's for sure. however, in group pvp, that shit is the best thing if you want to kill a pocket healer, of all things. mind control the guy that keeps peeling enemies off him, and bam, you've got a more-or-less helpless healer. or just dot him up, MC him and wait as he dies, once again helpless.
---
or, mind vision: most people learn it, use it once or twice then forget about it, because, well, seeing through the eyes of someone else is neat and all, but what are you going to use it for, anyway? that spell is the best way not only to pinpoint the location of the enemy flag carrier, but to know exactly his defenses. there is a huge difference between "efc at roof" and "efc at roof above the tunnel, with a mage, a night elf priest (possibly stealthed) and a hunter".  or you can use it to, y'know, [make someone experience what it's like to be schizophrenic...](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/avhfw9/what_was_your_best_trolling_methods_when_bored/ehgll9u/)
---
relax
---
Does this map show flight paths?
---
yeah and I can see from my verbiage it appears as though I meant it as a certainty, but I was purely being hypothetical/exagerating to facilitate the point. The fact is if its even a little bit popular my point still stands.
---
I found a Warden Staff from those dwarves in Searing Gorge on the top-ground lvl nearest to the quest hub. I think I was like running to BRM or something because I was 60 and idk why else I would have killed it other than getting dazed (maybe I was farming cloth because I was a massive noob and didnt do it while lvling). 
---
Anyway just remember rushing to IF and spamming that I was selling it in trade chat and this really angsty kid from my old lvling guild that always bought a ton of gold called me out on it and demanded to know where I got it. I told him and like 20 minutes later I got a really long rant whisper from him saying I was a lying PoS and he was going to  open a ticket to a GM and tell them I was deceiving people and get me banned and tell everyone in general I was a ninja every time he saw my name popped up etc. I just muted him but always kind of wondered if he ever did any of those things lel.
---
I wonder if it would help if it was limited to 5v5 arena. There's a certain balancing factor to simply throwing more variables at the game and seeing what sticks. 5v5 would likely have fewer metagamed compositions than the smaller brackets.
---
I remember being sick on the occasional Tuesday and realizing I couldn't play until like 11pm. Sad days. Even sadder for those on the east coast 
---
Best year yet!
---
I felt this, and benefited from it, during TBC. Once I geared I could hold an AB flag almost indefinitely against 2-3, and sometimes 4, as a resto druid. It was nice to feel powerful, but it weirdly made my enjoyment of the game go down knowing that things had become so broken. 
---
BTW, I was a bit poop on my druid, knew how to play but I wasn't what you would call good. 
---
How long did you stay lev 20?
---
Cat is just bad in vanilla sorry. You probably won't get kicked out of a raid as long as you have tons of consumables and make sure your gear/enchants are up to date - you should be able to keep up with the spriests/hunters etc but don't expect to see your name up the meters. Feral PvP is basically just tanking things in bear, kiting, and refreshing hots/dots. You only use cat form for sprint and stealth/pounce. If your idea of feral is a scary cat that goes around killing things and occasionally shifts to heal or bash/charge then you're going to be very disappointed in vanilla feral.
---
So is argument from fallacy, aka the “fallacy fallacy” which is what you are doing. See:
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_fallacy
---
So yes, it is a logical fallacy, but so what? We are not conducting a mathematical proof, we are talking about human behavior, and when humans are given an inch, they like taking a mile, and, again, *there is direct precedent of this happening in the ver game under discussion.*
---
the iconic music like  
---
# Trance - 009 Sound System Dreamscape
---
I agree to some extent but saying things like "warriors choosing Fury or Prot for PvP". 
---
I mean 
---
A) warriors can already do that in 1.12
---
B) Warriors are the class with the best set of talents trees in 1.12, so they should be the last class to receive any kind of buff.
---
I think sometime in TBC talent trees peaked, since they fixed the issues with Paladins and Druids not being viable dps/tanks (can't comment on Shaman). I would be loather to see any stupid talents like Titan's Grip in any "evolved" version of Classic though.
---
Extending the talent trees add so many balancing issues though that didn't have to be addressed when the 41 pt trees dropped and we were still capped at 60. It was ok having 41 point talents in 2.0 since TBC was coming and Vanilla was over at that point. They were balanced for having 61 talent points not 51. 
---
Overall, I'd be more in favour of borrow some of the final talents and fixing the broken specs in vanilla if they do go down this road.
---
The 'gear issue' is so overblown. 90% of your gear is going to be from quests. It's very rare something will drop that's good for you BoE in the world. It's really only ever an issue at all if you run a lot of dungeons but really you shouldn't ever expect to get a nice blue drop without winning a roll or two anyway.
---
1) For talents, I think Nightfall is a waste while leveling. It offers good burst but shadowbolts cost a lot of mana and rip threat of your vw. You will have more downtime eating/drinking. I would put those 2 points in Suppression.
---
2) Shadoweave vs spirit gear - I think it's faster if you stack spirit while leveling to minimize downtime. The speed gained from killing things faster doesn't offset the amount of downtime from eating/drinking more.
---
as*
---
Engineering's also good for pvp, but I like being able to buff my own equipment, and eventually you can make money from tips if you get the good enchants.  Also puts you in a good position with any potential guilds.
---
Skilled Druids were unkillable in PvP
---
I used to "time" my demon armor when a mob would attack me. I thought the animation was doing something. Did that till level 6. Was pretty much mana starved. 
---
WoW and Halo were pretty much my favorite games back in the day, the fact that in 2019 they're both getting love is amazing. Nostalgia overload.
---
Great argument. Didn't expect anything better.
---
Yeah sorry but this is worth doing in order to lessen the number of dead realms after all the tourists are gone, that's just selfish. Private server launches are still there for you, and there will probably be new big servers launching before Classic is even released.
---
Alternatively, you could just set [this as your desktop background](https://preview.redd.it/96gmi8frqtwz.gif?format=png8&amp;s=c25b6e61a1d69f6374b43a23a5c801c6b548ea9b) and then not log in until sharding is disabled. Make sure to play on a square monitor and throttle your internet connection too.
---
Please stop - I can only handle so much nostalgia. 
---
It’s like I’m halfway into a DM run and found out the hunter we picked up to fill the group was a argumentative douchebag. But it’s too late to kick you because we just killed sneed and nobody’s gonna hop in now...
---
Glad I could help you see reason :)
---
no that would make it so ugly, there are other maps for that
---
If you lead with immolate you still can.  I find straight affliction works fine with VW until you get siphon life when you can switch to imp and just drain tank.  Drain tanking also gets you in a mindset to be prepared for ganks if you're playing on a pvp server, whereas that VW sacrifice will only go so far.
---
And if enchanting is bad, why are people constantly spamming looking for enchants?
---
Naxx fucks stuff up, but MC-AQ era PvP balance is undoubtedly better than the PvP balance on any given TBC patch or raid tier. There's a reason why private servers tend to die around Naxxramas, besides the emergence of new servers.
---
I have the same problem. I went to finish my fresh RDR2 and New Vegas files, but all I want to do is level my bear tank. They sit incomplete.
---
Purge to get rid of that pesky ice armor then earth shock to interrupt the frost bolt and before they can blink BAM WF CRIT LOL.
---
I never raided past MC/ZG/Ony in Vanilla. I've cleared Naxx on PServers now because I wanted to complete my WoW journey. And it felt just as magical. And I'm coming back in the summer after an 18 month break to do it all again :)
---
I always was sick or had a snow day on Tuesdays. 
---
Shadow priest, ret, feral and elemental could no longer mainheal in TBC because the healer trees were too powerful. Disagree completely.
---
obviously it won't be the same but it will still be pretty damn good so who fucking cares
---
&gt; The quality is clear enough that you can see which buttons he's pressing and how much rage he has. There are no adds during stage 2 that would need to be tanked. Besides, tanking the nerubians requires minimal TPS, since nobody other than you will ever attack them. Any other ideas?
---
This is exactly the game moon landing deniers play. "I am confused by a potato video - unless you can make me not confused, to my own satisfaction, that is proof there is a massive conspiracy!". One last time: neither of us knows what is going on there, they aren't here to defend themselves, and even if they sucked that doesn't prove everyone sucked.
---
&gt; This video confirms that you can do MC in 70 minutes even if your group composition is garbage (and includes 5 memespec DPS), people spec and play incorrectly and aren't fully buffed,
---
Well done, you finally found some actual relevant evidence!
---
That does close the gap between pirate server times and retail vanilla times significantly. Getting it done in under half the time is still a stretch to credibility given the skill ceiling in WoW, but much less than getting it done in one third the time.
---
Is it possible to “pick up where you left off?”
---
Whatever characters you have are in retail yeah?
---
Am I totally out of my mind, but weren’t patch days always on wednesdays?? In EU at least? I’m quite sure I always came disappointed from school on wednesdays
---
Will there be an option to play Classic with good/modern graphics? 
---
As someone who never played Vanilla (started in Wrath), and therefore doesn't hold nostalgia for it, playing on a Pserver has been an absolute blast. The sheer levelling and progression of the game feels 1000x better than other MMO's I've played, especially current retail. Some of the magic might have been through younger eyes, but most of it was due to the amount of love that went into crafting the game.
---
 Agreed. Fuck TBC and what it did to PvP.
---
I'm going to say no. I haven't seen any data to support your hypothesis. Servers in my experience tend to have very different economy's.
---
I like the leveling process of Horde a lot better in Azeroth. I heard they did Alliance first and then did Horde zones, and it's hard to even question that because it seems very obvious. Horde also seems more like a fantasy theme, yeah there's a lot of UD but like 5/10 Alliance players are Humans. Still, I'm probably going to go Alliance because I've never had a max lvl paladin before so I'm really leaning towards that.
---
Yeah, if we want post-naxx content we need to start telling Blizzard to nerf Naxx gear.
---
I have done it both ways and honestly have not felt a meaningful difference in actual gameplay, but point taken
---
No thanks, current Activision would fuck up every class.
---
The only way your point would stand would be if "Retail" runescape were as casual friendly as Retail wow and had as large a casual following. I'm guessing even "Retail" runescape isn't that casual friendly which means OSRC is the more popular product of two non-casual friendly products in which case the better of the two non-casual friendly products has garnered the larger non-casual friendly playerbase.

It's a completely different scenario with WoW
---
Haha I remember this guild, I played on khadgar too 
---
If I went priest I would mostly heal. I was talking about shadow as kind of a tie breaker between shaman and priest. I enjoy both classes but if ever decided not to heal I’d prefer to play shadow than ele/enhance. 
---
Sounds like either troll or UD would be fine
---
Oh hey, it's the "Warlock mount is shit" guy again. I wonder why you even care to discuss the relative merits of the Warlock mount, considering how Warlocks weren't optimal DPS. According to your logic here, people shouldn't play Warlocks at all, so why even bother talking about the mount?
---
No rtard
---
You alright my dude?
---
Great post, could not agree more. TBC is what killed not only WoW, but the entire MMO genre for the past 15 years.
---
they announced a tour for the album and confirmed began mastering so couldnt be far off
---
Yeah, go mining/herbs along with everyone else that will be starting at level 1 and see how many nodes you can farm.  Tailoring isn't even that much of a goldsink unless you're powerleveling it which won't be possible on a fresh start because who's going to be selling in bulk?
---
I wonder what he wants as I run past him to keep questing since it's not a pvp server and he can't hurt me.
---
Honestly I can't even watch videos or think about it too much anymore. I just get too damn excited. I already know what class/race I'll main and I'm just ready to get started.
---
i meant teh greater point about numbers, not runescape.
---
iirc that works for all races, the graphics are green, same as a nature healing spell.
---
By that logic you should be opposed to Classic WoW because they would also fuck it up.
---
Wait, what? Sharding is cross realm? I thought it was a local thing. 
---
Private servers are not official vanilla and even though I know you are being fascicious I want to note that I'm not talking about the experience sharding will bring I'm talking about the experience it removes.

---
yeah lets add flying lfd lfr to vanilla! History should repeat itself!
---
&gt; Almost means almost. Not 50/50.
---
Yes. I assume you think you have a point. I am not sure what you think it is though.
---
&gt; Why would you lock your XP if you're leveling? That makes no sense.
---
A couple of reasons. For one my original goal was to level by PvPing to force myself to get good at PvP, because I sucked at it. Still do, I guess, but I suck less. But I still needed to go into the overworld for some things, like getting new pets. For some dumb reason at the time my pets didn't get xp from battlegrounds, so every couple of levels I had to go on a pilgrimage to get a new one.
---
I also heard that a geared level 18 toon could solo the Wailing Caverns, so I locked xp and gave it a try. It turned out you could, because they had nerfed it so hard. Everything was two-pulls. So I killed a few bosses and got some nice shoulders before getting bored with that. If I hadn't locked xp I would have levelled right out of the bracket doing that.
---
I also needed money for bandages and whatnot, so I herbed and mined in between battlegrounds. But I left xp on and used my pet to deal with mobs that got in my way for that.
---
Why would you ever "drain tank" when you can just use your voidwalker to tank, adding extra dps with melee hits and preventing yourself from taking damage
---
No idea what you mean about imp making you prepared for ganks. Just stay full hp with VW out and soulstone up.
---
If you want to be an enchanter for your guild and they give you some recipes sure you can sit in org/IF and make some gold through tips. Engineering/Tailoring are always the best for warlocks because of the BoP items.
---
Hmm, I'm guessing warlock would be hardest to twink at that level. Not many spell power options at that level. Rogue and Hunter twink well.
---
I love 39 bracket. Pre-armor upgrades, pre-mount, pre-40 point talent (sucks for some specs mind you). Was a great spot for twinking a feral. That's my go to for 39.
---
Ask yourself...
---
What Would Jaina Do?
---
Same mate, over 90 days played Vanilla to Wrath, no epic world drop. You are not alone!
---
NEVER!
---
Yes, definitely, just getting into the spirit of things!
---
No changes exists for a reason...
---
Lol shareholders don't care about cash shops and have 0 involvment in how companies are run. Shareholders only care about stock value, they leave the details of increasing company profitability to those running the company. Those running the company look at the company overall.
---
Alternatively they'd have to balance cash shops vs server population and for a game like classic class invasive cash shops (just a reminder that classic actually had a cash shops) will be counter-productive to maintaining or growing the classic playerbase.
---
So shareholders don't make any demands from a company and the company will manage their profitability from an overall perspective like it always does. If Blizzard introduces cash-shop products that diminish or devalue people's in game effort or services that damage communities they're going to take a hit in their playerbase as a consequence and the Classic community holds both of those things in high regard.
---
Any news on an actual release date?
---
So you don't want vanilla. You want a snapshot of the game at a specific point in time.
---
&gt;If they use the same private server release schedule, it will be well over a year until Naxx comes out.
---
&gt;So to be clear, in progression MC with frozen 1.12, fury warriors are doing over double the DPS of enhancement shamans. In actual live (at least prior to 1.4) enhancement was on par, if not better than fury. This is not a "big change" to you? Well great - not even the most ambitious pro balance changes advocate wants anything even close to that. If this is small for you, then what I'm asking for is microscopic.
---
It is not a big change simply because it is temporary. You are advocating for forever lasting changes.
---
&gt;And just to be clear, it seems more likely than not that the server size will be much larger, which is a big change, no matter how you cut it.
---
I don't think Blizzard has said that they will increase the cap and to what degree. If they did then I must have missed it and would ask for a link if you have one.
---
Server size doesn't change the content I enjoy the most which is dungeons with friends and BGs but I would prefer the old caps.
---
&gt;I mean warrior got buffs in 1.5, 1.6 (talent overhaul), 1.7, 1.8 (normalization), 1.11 (shield slam increased threat).
---
Sounds like a lot but 1.5.-1.8. All happened within 4 months. Now I obviously don't have all the class changes from 14 years ago memorized but as I said before. Yes, there were adjustments but big adjustments for your class didn't occur too frequently. I guess it depends on what you define as "big". 
---
&gt;I also don't really see where you're with this. As best I can tell you're saying "Yes most players experienced changes to their class, not just a purely static class. Therefore, having a purely static class is closer to the Vanilla experience." Obviously you couldn't have meant this, so please correct me.
---
You are pretty much correct. My point is that significant individual changes were unfrequent enough for me to personally consider them part of the vanilla experience. 
---
And that changes which weren't in vanilla are not part of the vanilla experience goes without saying for me.
---
A similar example for me would be Diablo 2 which I still play to this day years later. Now the game hasn't been updated in years while having recieved lots of updates in the past.
---
Is the game now "less Diablo" because it hasn't received updates in forever? No, it is perfect for me. The game is just as it always was once it stopped getting updates. This is what I want with classic. I want it to be like TBC never came out.
---
&gt;Well I guess we have to agree to disagree. I think a game that had 12 major patches, + and like 4-5x as many smaller patches is Vanilla. You think a static snapshot of how it ended is Vanilla.
---
Fine with me. I wouldn't have anything against a server with potential changes down the road foe people who are interested. I personally want to have the possibilty for an unchanged vanilla 1.12 experience though.
---
&gt;No, probably not. At the very least, the server size will probably be larger, causing a big difference.
---
Answered this above.
---
&gt;And I don't understand why it doesn't matter to you - these are substantial changes for longs periods of time. Most of the players who pick up the game are going to experience these changes and put the game down before all the content is released.
---
It is not a big deal because the version I want is going to be there eventually and I am patient enough to not access it immediately.
---
&gt;Whether it matters to you or not doesn't change the fact that it matters a whole lot to the people who asked for it, and that it is in fact a change...
---
Again, it is only temporary change. The balance adjustments you are arguing for would be here to stay. That is the big difference.
---
AMAZIN
---
There's a lot of truth to this post that people tend to ignore. I personally loathe the PvP specs of TBC, for a large part due to arena.
---
TBC pigeon holed you into specific PvP specs hard. Water Elemental, the spell that I see many mages proclaim their love for, fucked up PvP balance for Mages so hard that Frost became officially recognised as "the PvP spec" for mages for several expansions. It was so bad that it was obvious that Blizzard had just given up even making the other specs viable for PvP by some point in WotLK.
---
Heck, Frost's reputation became so big that even now I see many people regard deep frost as the de-facto PvP spec of vanilla as well, even though it simply wasn't. Many mages back in the day stuck religiously to AP PoM Pyro even after repeated nerfs. PoM frost became popular after the nerfs, and by the time the mage revamp came around Elemental started to become real popular. Deep frost is certainly a good build in vanilla, but I'm confident that the % of PvP mages with that build never once got close to 50% back in the day.
---
I remember skipping school intentionally one day my senior year on a Tuesday...It was an abnormally long maintenance period, and the servers came up literally the moment my best friend walked in from school! I was soooo mad, and kept my skipping to Mondays from then on out.
---
yea Resto druids and Disc priest were the biggest ones. I would attack one with some friends and they would spam laugh as none of us could even put a dent in em. Straight up invincible cheat codes.
---
&gt; super secret server
---
Not a fan of your choice of leveling talents, in my opinion it's quite inefficient and slow.  If you're really looking for an efficient way to level as a warlock you should look into drain tanking by going deep affliction and using your affliction dots --&gt; drain life.  If I know there's a lot of WPvP happening, i'll run around with my VW on passive and have it hit tank/hit mobs if I'm engaging more than 2, but mainly use it for Sac when getting ganked.  You will be a god.
---
Good old Lordaeron
---
Rogue is the best imo, you have so much control over you’re experience as a rogue twink in battlegrounds. 
---
Ranged DPS can be fun, but I think you have a lot of games where you’re either mobbed, or chewing through crowds like you have guns and everyone else has swords. 
---
With a rogue, you always get to be exactly where you want, doing what you want. Nothing beats in in pug battlegrounds imo. Not to mention world pvp if so desired. 
---
have an upvote:)
---
I think Kang the Decapitator. I've had it drop more than once but for some reason I think it's my 1st from retail Classic.
---
I think that /u/bshootingu has already told you what was classic and you just don’t make the effort to understand: for some of us Vanilla wasn’t specific talent or balance but a game that changed frequently with new patch, new discoveries and favor of the months builds and having something already known in advance with every talent tree and BIS set in stone is the antithesis of Vanilla.
---
Now of course, like almost everyone arguing for no change, it’s almost only the slippery slope argument: what if they mess up? Where do they stop? If we allow that we will get transmo-pet-battle-LFG-raid so go play retail and go away! 
---
Now I get that people don’t trust Blizzard in 2019 and feel it’s safer to be asking for no change but Iit means having something less interesting that if they were to take some risks.
---
And personally I’d say that WoW Vanilla balance and spirit isn’t rocket science: it’s not hard to follow the spirit of the game and not totally mess up: don’t add stuff like log/flying mounts/new content that make the rest of the game obsolete and we’ll be fine. Make raid a bit harder, change balance to spice things, add some random stuff here and there to add a little sense of discovery and the game would feel more classic than a static version.
---
And the most predictable answer seasoned with smile. Perfection.  
---
There is too much emphasis on balancing pvp in games these days. Nothing is as fun as melting faces in world pvp. Even if i gotta spend 2hr getting corps caped by someone who got really pissed. I love how it can kinda be rock paper scissors.
---
Reset/patch/maintenance days are different by region. So NA/Latin/Oceanic realms are on Tuesday while EU has it on Wednesday.
---
Black lotus were worth like 50ish gold on p severs with 10000 people competing for resources meant for a server with 3000 people. Demand was stupid high and people were abusing farming methods causing the gold supply to massively inflate. 
---
Not only will there be less people farming the same amount of resources, but less people inflating the gold supply by farming vendor loot. I'd expect black lotus to be worth around 10-20g each after a few months in when there are more people farming them and raiding.
---
Yeah, I think I'm going to do that. It's just a couple hours of paying a little more attention. I'd rather save the respec.
---
I live in Asia but still play on NA realms so I am not too bothered by it anymore. Most downtime begins Tuesday evening for me and is over by the time I wake up.
---
No it’s not possible to “pick up where you left off “but I looked like that when the burning Crusade came out which made all of the dungeons obsolete for level 60. Now I’ll get to really experience what they were like. I’ll have to work my way back up of course
---
Ya when it comes to world pvp, I ALWAYS rushed my feral to 40+. Dire Bear is required to be able to defeat rogues.

How do elem shamans fair in 1v1 situations against melee classes?
---
Unlock for you she was SL. And now you are dead.
---
The player base will still be adults, wtf is a Druid truce, who cares about GMs in game, nothing is new but who says it can’t be fun anyway. Do you still have fun on a swing set as an adult, even though it’s nothing new? Yup 
---
This is a company who added LFR, flying, and LFD to the game, though. I highly doubt they know when to draw the line.
---
Uh I think it's supposed to be the sepulcher in silverpine forest
---
True, and it's what I'm hoping for as well. Though in those opening days, I have a feeling it's gonna be crowded enough to warrant it anyway even with sharding, because there's quite a few "bottleneck" quests.
---
Even if sharding limited it to 50 people in somewhere like Northshire Abbey, that's still at least 10 groups worth of people competing for Garrick Padfoot and helping each other get grape pickups. Without sharding, it'd be more like several hundred people. Both with and without sharding would require groups in early levels to get anything done, though I'd see the former as not-ludicrous for "tourists," who might actually realize they like that forced cooperation and stick around to play and learn classic like a whole new MMORPG and count themselves among its community.
---
Maybe you personally prefer really hectic and chaotic environments where a lot is going on. But I just see something less incoherent to be more beneficial when it comes to those areas that are, mark my words *guaranteed* to be overcrowded, and still reinforcing grouping due to the sheer volume of people who'll be playing while sharding is happening. Sharding won't be around forever.
---
39 warlock. 2 dots means death even for other twinks.
---
You're welcome :)
---
Ok but only Shaman and Druid though, since Priest and Pally are Holy heals.
---
&gt;Wait, what? Sharding is cross realm? I thought it was a local thing.
---
No? What gave you that idea? It is in BFA (because there are many dead realms), but in Classic it's only to be used to split up individual realms, not to merge. 
---
I don't think he meant it literally.
---
/r/wowservers may be helpful, discussing private servers on this sub is banned
---
I would love to see a few TBC servers within classic. Maybe if the playerbase is large enough. 
---

It's mostly up to you on when to use the hearthstone precisely, but in my time using it, the guide is usually opportune with Joana's hearthstones.
---
The time taken to move to Orgrimmar from Razor Hill is about 4 minutes to the Leatherworking trainer. I assure you this is an insignificant amount of time compared to getting the wand this early.
---
Fair comment. Like I said I'm not sure what the solution is. I just would hate to end up on a faction that is steamrolling the opposition. 
---
I personally am alright with rerolling elsewhere if that is the case but many of my friends will have difficulty with that. 
---
I guess you have never listened to an activision shareholder conference call. For the record they are publicly available, so please go inform yourself. In any of acitivisions you can listen to the shareholders, they very specifically do exactly what are saying they dont.
---
And how long did that fancy getup last for, 5 levels tops?
---
Cool
---
2004 it was all traps
---
It’s only natural for me to downvote things I disagree with. How else can I foster productive conversations?? 
---
Problematic counters to that are all the hots from druids and cleansing. Dots rarely see full impact and even a well timed health pot can counter an entire dot.
---
Its still pretty much changes vs no changes.
---
I also however wonder, if people realize that the broken itemization and heavily relying on the RPG aspect is what actually kept the whole content of vanilla constantly playable and thus remembered.
---
Do we trust a completely different people and vision to add post launch content that won't turn into WotlK? Im refering to the ToC/IC content which made 80% of the game pointless and easy. 
---
What i stand for is simple tbh. There are many risks involved in changing an 15 year old game which has pretty much nothing to do with anything that came after it, even TBC. Its not just talents, content, balance, RPG elements, itemisations and class roles. Its all of these combined which can very well break even with the smallest touch. Maybe in the end its indeed about trust, which sadly i do not have. And even if i did its still different team, a team that brought WoW to a point where id rather play a 15 year old game than trust them to reinvent that 15 years old game.
---
Dude I bought 3 keyboards in search for this answers, I have a Razor Chroma which is a full sized keyboard and Green razor switches. The razor blackwidow tournament edition chroma v2 which is an 80% keyboard with Yellow razor switches and finally I have the Ducky one 2 mini 60% keyboard with Cherry MX Blue Switches.
---
 Razor products have their own switches and there are 3 of them. Razor (green, orange, yellow) I honestly prefer razor switches over Cherry MX switches.
---
They say razor greens are most like cherry mx blue and this is a false statement. I ordered a tester kit after taking the advance of a friend and ordering cherry mx blue and honestly I hate them for gaming. The cherry MX greens relate more the the razor greens but honestly don’t compare imo. The razor yellow switches like the ones I have on my Blackwidow closely resemble the Cherry Mx reds and this is my favorite keyboard by far. Although I do enjoy razor green switches aswell just not the full size keyboard of the razor chroma. 
---
The only issue I have with the razor yellow switches or in your case the cherry mx reds is that I have been playing with razor green switches for years and these are clicky switches that have resistance before the actuation point, so I became custom to testing my fingers over my movement keys, because the Razor yellow/cherry mx red is linear and there is no actuation point that you can physically feel, I occasionally move left or right by accident but not a big deal at all. 
---
The issue that I find with Clicky switches and why I don’t approve of them for gaming is because they’re not an easy key to spam, the actuation point is further down and it takes more time for the button to come up and go back down. Making spamming tricky. 
---
Anyways I recommend the Razor Blackwidow Tournament Edition V2, it’s rather expensive but worth it in my opinion, it’ll run you 140 but it comes with a magnetic wrist pad that very comfortable as it is designed specifically for that keyboard vs buying a keyboard and wrist pad separately. The razor Croma is also a great keyboard but it is a full scale one, not my personal favorite but it will only run you 99$ 
---
The ducky one 2 60% is also 99% but this is more of an FPS shooter keyboard as it is very small and allows you more room to shoot with your mouse. 
---
What do you mean on a rogue don't bother, warrior is actual garbage tier vs any rogue with more IQ than the average room temperature
---
If you want to do this the easiest way is to set up a private vanilla repack, I wont discuss it any further than that here but you can either PM me or train your google skills.
---
It's personal preference. I use reds because I prefer a linear switch, don't like the "bump" of blues/browns.
---
What is your average game time played to 60 on rogue doing it this way
---
That makes no fucking sense.
---
You won't faceroll anything if the warrior know how to play and has Engineering
---
There's no time for that
---
I used to twink on Khadgar without having a main there,  horde side. Remontoire was exalted with WSG before hitting 20. Good times

Such noobs.

I got reds and they are really nice once you get use to them but if i had my time back i would of went for the browns. Its gets loud once you do some pvp and you have to smack 8 different buttons in 3 secs lol and for the first months you will be miss pressing like crazy because how sensitive they are.

I much prefer the down to earth people in this sub. People who can take both banter and criticism alike, and not to mention, focuses on the game we play, instead of posting lame attempts to get upvotes. You know, cosplays, tattoos, mediocre drawings, and so on

Mage can just nova/CoC -&gt; get range, poly and open up with frost bolts at 33 yards, way out of earth shock range.  Enhancement isn't much more annoying to kill than a warrior.

Oh man, I would have been pissed.
---
I remember the day I skipped high school. Holy shit that was a boring day. Not being able to go home because you need to hide out somewhere.

I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought of that episode!
---
Warrior is way harder to level wtf r u talking about? 
---
Redridge can get pretty gnarly with all the elites
---
Sounds like priest is the go to then! Just seems to be a small preference in the type of content you want to focus on. Troll slightly better in pvp as shadow and in pve healing with undead being slightly better in pvp healing and still alright in pve healing. Tbh the difference is pretty miniscule so pick for aesthetics.
---
WoW was more than a game. It’s like a great movie, album, or book.  Even though I know the song, you bet your ass I will enjoy singing along again. And this time it’s not some cover band!

Nearly everything

Since I'm not concerned much about endgame - I'm rolling Alliance. I am having a bad case of alt-itus but I've decided that should I choose to roll up a hunter and rogue I'll make them Horde; but the Lock, Warrior, Mage, Priest and (Obviously) Paladin will be alliance. Warrior and Clothies on PVE; Paladin on RP-PVE. 
---
I've always been horde. Time for me to go Alliance. I think it'll be nice having a brand new experience.
---
Can you say at what level the wand is made, and what the /played  when it is made?
---
Should have to prove it through Blizz ID that you're a man or a woman before you pick female or male in an MMO. So many girl pickers these days. Back in my time, you only played a girl to trick people into giving you a bunch of free stuff because you're bad at the game, or because you're actually a girl.
---
I don't want to hear how they have better animations and how you don't want a man's ass in your face. No.
---
So many weird-boys in the world and most of them seem to play WoW, and most of *them* seem to play alliance.
---
When people hear 'starting zones' they think of 1-5, but blizzard probably means 1-20. When push comes to shove, seeing someone disappear in Crossroads will drive players away.
---
Good stuff!
---
s there any similary map with all flight paths included?
---
Thank You!
---
I'm split just like you. I decided Mage because this time around I am going to be more casual and the convenience that comes with Mage is what made the decision for me. I think you really can't go wrong with either though.

it's about damn time. I've wanted to buy halo on steam for as long as I can remember

/r/Classicwow, *never* turn into what /r/2007scape currently is
---
PvP in WoW has never been great, though. Even in Vanilla (imo the best version of WoW PvP) class balance was dogshit and fights basically resolved around 1-shots or kiting forever.
---
I don't know where these claims of "TBC ruined PvP" are coming from, because WoW PvP has *never* been great. It was more *fun* in vanilla because it was silly imbalanced and simple, but it wasn't well-designed.
---
There will be new friends and new community. New magic and wonder. It won't be the same but who is to say it has to be? All journeys have a new beginning.
---
I don't think they're similar to blues at all. They're much closer to reds really. The bump really isn't very pronounced and it's the same force as a red. You're probably going to bottom them out anyways and then they're basically just reds. 
---
Hey Flohx, let me know if you end up finding a guild. I work late, and don't get off until 10PM PST so I am also looking for a late night / early morning raiding guild.

Don't seed torrents. They can't force him to delete it, they just want him to stop seeding (and potentially downloading) the game files. Not the right sub to ask for this stuff anyways. 
---
Tuesdays were great. It was that opportunity to do laundry, but groceries, get ahead on school work.
---
I've never had anything like this happen to me, not for World of Warcraft anyways.
---
Was he seeding the download? The usually the quickest way to get caught with any torrent.
---
I appreciate the map. But it is either easily usable or not. Resolution doesnt help. 
---
"Okay I deleted it"  
---
There. All done.  
---
Have fun playing.  
---
I'm surprised how many dungeon drops are green early on.
---
He was for a brief minute. This all happened within a span of 2 hours.
---
Yeah my significant other will be pressing all my keybinds while my ex will run the mouse.  
---
I switched from right to left at some point in the past. Weird I know.  
---
&gt;  blizzard probably means 1-20
---
I suspect it's 1-10 because Ion specifically mentioned Elwynn Forest.

It was hard to tell! I'm sorry. Forgive my sins.
---
pretty much. I loved it back then, but I don't want that for Classic. 
---
It really depends on what class you were.  Some class revamps didn’t happen for over a year.  Others felt like they never really worked out.  My paladin always felt broken.
---
&gt; I think most would agree that TBC and Wraith were Blizz's peak in terms of class and spec balance. That being said, Classic simply wasn't designed with the additional spells and talents in mind. If you were to add those, you'd have to rebalance the entire game so much so that you're basically making it anew.
---
It didn't seem to work that way in real vanilla. The reality we experienced was that vanilla was a robust game and even relatively major changes like the big class reviews did not force Blizzard to "rebalance the entire game so much so that you're basically making it anew".
---
For that matter the fact that pirate servers work despite massive changes from real vanilla proves the same point.
